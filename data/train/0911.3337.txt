    "superconductivity has been known in graphite intercalation compounds ( gics ) for over 40 years.@xcite until recently , however , the maximum ambient pressure superconducting transition temperature was limited to about 2k.@xcite the discovery of superconductivity in cac@xmath0 at the enhanced transition temperature @xmath1 = 11.5k changed this and reignited the interest in superconductivity in graphite intercalation compounds ( gics).@xcite although early reports suggested that the superconducting mechanism involved coupling via acoustic plasmons,@xcite the current consensus is that the superconductivity is close to _",
    "s_-wave symmetry@xcite and phonon mediated.@xcite having said this , some controversy remains as different experimental and theoretical techniques implicate different phonons and electrons as being primarily responsible for the coupling .",
    "experiments have revealed a ca isotope coefficient of 0.5 , which is consistent with coupling to only the low energy ca phonons.@xcite density functional theory ( dft ) , however , predicts that in - plane ca@xmath2 vibrations and out - of - plane c@xmath3 phonons contribute roughly equally , coupling electrons via transitions involving the interlayer band.@xcite information about electron - phonon coupling can also be inferred from specific heat of cac@xmath0 measurements.@xcite a detailed comparison between the experimental results and calculations finds that the electron - phonon coupling to the c@xmath3 modes is stronger than dft predicts . further adding to the inconsistencies , a recent angle - resolved photo - emission ( arpes ) measurement proposes a entirely different picture , as it finds sufficient coupling between the in plane c@xmath2 modes and the @xmath4 electrons to account for t@xmath5 without other contributions.@xcite however , the extraction of this coupling is made difficult as the bands are predicted by dft to curve in that region.@xcite a first step to resolving these problems is to measure the phonons to ensure that they are accurately predicted by dft .    due to the highly anisotropic structure of cac@xmath0 ,",
    "its phonons can be divided into different groups based on the predominant atomic motion , which occupy different energy windows .",
    "the ca atoms are much heavier and more weakly bonded than the c atoms , so the ca - related phonons occur at the lowest energies typically below @xmath6 40mev .",
    "the graphene sheets have strong planar bonding , meaning that the out - of - plane c@xmath3 modes fall between 40 - 80mev , while the in - plane c@xmath2 modes are higher energy and dominate the spectrum from 100 - 180mev . to date the main phonon dispersion measurements in cac@xmath0",
    "were performed using inelastic x - ray and neutron scattering and concentrate on phonons below @xmath6 40mev.@xcite .",
    "although some phonon modes of the measured dispersion are well reproduced by the dft calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , other modes are substantially underestimated in energy . furthermore , an anti - crossing of a longitudinal acoustic mode with an unknown mode was discovered,@xcite which was tentatively ascribed to vacancies in the cac@xmath0 crystal .",
    "the higher energy phonons in cac@xmath0 have only been measured using raman scattering.@xcite raman scattering normally only measures phonons at small momentum transfer near the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "furthermore , phonons measured by raman scattering are not representative of the phonons across the brillouin zone , as they are subject to non - adiabatic effects , which lead to large energy shifts at the zone center.@xcite    for these reasons we have performed a neutron scattering measurement of the high energy c@xmath2 and c@xmath3 phonons in cac@xmath0 .",
    "there are two principle aims : to compare experiment measurement and theoretical predictions for the high energy phonons in cac@xmath0 and to search for any temperature dependence of the phonons , which if present , might imply strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we note that this is the first neutron scattering measurement of the high energy graphitic phonons in any gic .",
    "section [ sec : expmethods ] describes the experimental methods .",
    "macroscopic gic samples are typically highly textured , due to the texture of the starting graphite , which means that an average of the scattered intensity is performed over a large swath of reciprocal space when the neutron spectrometer is set for nominal energy and wavevector transfers . section [ sec : thmethods ] outlines calculations to account for the sampling of the brillouin zone to allow a detailed comparison between dft and experiment .",
    "we discuss the good overall agreement between experiment and theory and how it could be further improved in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] outlines the implications of our work in light of the current literature on cac@xmath0 .",
    "samples were synthesized using the li - ca alloy method from @xmath6 50 strips of highly orientated pyrolytic graphite ( hopg).@xcite in this method the li atoms initially diffuse into the graphite to form lic@xmath0 , opening the graphite layers , after which the ca is able to replace the li to form the final sample .",
    "the resulting 700 mg of sample was sealed within an aluminium can to protect it from reacting with air , with the strips mounted on an aluminium plate with the sample c - axes aligned with one another .",
    "thin aluminium foil was used to hold the sample in place , to avoid the possibility of glue reacting with the sample .",
    "the sample was measured using in1 at the institute laue - langevin ( ill ) .",
    "this instrument is connected to the hot source of the ill reactor , which provides neutrons of sufficiently high energy to access the 200mev energy transfers required in this study .",
    "a cu ( 2 2 0 ) monochromator was chosen and scans were performed at a fixed final energy of 100mev , and an erbium filter was inserted before the double - focusing cu ( 2 0 0 ) analyzer to absorb spurious elastic signals.@xcite the sample was loaded into a closed - cycle refrigerator to control the sample temperature .",
    "data were taken at 5 and 20k and summed , taking into account changes in the bose - einstein factor , as these spectra proved to be identical . in this experiment",
    "we use the hexagonal representation of the cac@xmath0 unit cell with @xmath7 = @xmath8 = 4.333 , @xmath9 = 13.572 , @xmath10 = @xmath11 = 90@xmath12 and @xmath13 = 120@xmath12 , because this distinguishes the quasi - two dimensional nature of the sample more clearly than the rhombohedral unit cell . due to the nature of the starting graphite ( hopg ) , the sample consists of crystallites of size @xmath6 1@xmath14m,@xcite which are aligned in the c - direction and powder - like in the ab - plane .",

    "a rocking curve performed on the ( 0 0 15 ) bragg peak shows that the c - axis mosaic of the total sample can be described by a gaussian ( @xmath21 ) with @xmath22 = 4.7@xmath12 . due to the inelastic cross section being inversely proportional to the large energy transfer,@xcite",
    "the neutron flux at the detector is relatively small and long counting times ( 1 - 2 days ) were required to obtain sufficient statistics for the analysis .",
    "it is instructive to consider the relative neutron scattering efficiency of the c and ca atoms within the sample , which have scattering cross sections @xmath23 = 5.55 and @xmath24 = 2.78barns and masses @xmath25 = 12 and @xmath26 = 40 atomic mass units .",
    "the phonon scattering intensity is directly proportional to the cross section and inversely proportional to the mass .",
    "consequently when the sample stoichiometry is accounted for , the ratio of c to ca phonon scattering is @xmath27 @xmath20 40 .",
    "such a high ratio implies that the vast majority of the scattering will be from the phonons involving predominantly c atom motion .",

    "the textured nature of the sample presents a challenge for comparison between theory and experiment .",

    "is calculated at several points included in a toroidal - like volume in reciprocal space , which is most straightforwardly described in spherical polar coordinates @xmath31 .",
    "as the sample is powder - like in plane this causes all @xmath32 to be sampled equally .",
    "the c - axis mosaic , as determined by the rocking curve , is the dominant contribution to the sampling of @xmath33 , which is represented using gaussian sampling with @xmath22 = 4.7@xmath12 .",
    "the sampling of @xmath34 is described by another gaussian with @xmath22 = 0.1@xmath35 , which is consistent with the width of the in - plane diffraction peaks .",
    "this volume was sampled randomly and about 1000 @xmath15-points were required to achieve good convergence .",
    "the instrumental resolution function was calculated using the restrax software package,@xcite which performs monte carlo neutron simulations of the combined effect of in1 and the sample .",
    "this function was convolved with the simulated spectra .",
    "each simulation was checked to confirm that it was stable to small changes in the mosaic parameters .",
    "the c@xmath2 modes were measured with @xmath16 = 6 , @xmath17 = 0 and are depicted by the black points in fig . [ fig:600](a ) , which can be compared to the solid line from the theoretical simulation .",
    "we first discuss the two main peaks which dominate the spectrum at 137 and 172mev respectively .",
    "these are reasonably well reproduced by our first principles calculations .",
    "in particular , the peak at 137mev is reproduced well in the simulation and the peak at 172mev is predicted to be narrower and at about 2mev lower energy .",
    "further calculations were performed to analyze the phonons contributing to these peaks .",
    "figure [ fig:600](b ) and [ fig:600](c ) indicate the relative contributions to the scattering intensity for the two principle phonon peaks in the ranges 130 - 150 and 150 - 190mev respectively .",
    "the calculations reveal that different regions of the brillouin zone provide the majority of the phononic signal .",
    "the strong variation in scattering efficiency from various small areas of the brillouin zone demonstrates why a relatively large number of sampling points ( @xmath6 1000 ) were required to adequately represent the brillouin zone . from fig . [",
    "fig:600](b ) one can see that the @xmath6137mev peak comes predominantly from @xmath15 = ( 6 0 0 ) direction and symmetry related points .",
    "we note that the six - fold symmetry of these phonons arises because for the c based modes , the influence of the intercalant superlattice is only a weak perturbation of the six - fold symmetry of the graphene layers . in this experiment a large fraction of the brillouin zone is sampled in a rather uneven way , making the measurement almost , but not quite , a 2d density of states measurement . the intensity contributing to the peak at 150 - 190mev from is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:600](c ) this intensity comes from a larger region of reciprocal space and also displays six - fold symmetry .",
    "there are also two minor peaks at 120 and 196mev .",
    "the peak at 196mev is well above the highest calculated phonon frequency in cac@xmath0.@xcite since our samples have roughly 5@xmath36 of graphite , this peak could be due to the in - plane phonon vibrations of pristine graphite sheets , which are indeed near this energy.@xcite the broad peak at 120mev is also not completely reproduced in theoretical calculations .",
    "a peak is present in the theoretical structure factor but at substantially lower energy ( 113mev ) and with a lower intensity .",
    "it is important to note that the lower intensity is due to the highly dispersive nature of the c@xmath2 phonon dispersion in this region .",
    "as stated before , the in - plane averaged structure factor is related to the 2d phonon density of states . in graphite",
    "the c@xmath2 phonons are very flat near the @xmath37 point at @xmath38 mev .",
    "consequently this peak could also be due to pristine graphite .",
    "it would be surprising , however , if a @xmath39 content of graphite could give a relatively significant signal in neutron scattering .",
    "the c@xmath3 modes within cac@xmath0 were measured at @xmath16 = 2 and @xmath17 = 24 , where the large @xmath17 component acts to enhance the scattering power of the _ z_-polarized phonons . in this region of the spectrum , the strong incoherent scattering from the li impurities and the signal from the aluminium caused a background , which was modeled as two exponential functions and subtracted from the data .",
    "the data has peaks at 54 and 76mev .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:2024](a ) that the simulated spectrum reproduces the general shape of the spectrum quite well , however there are some differences .",
    "although the position of the peak at 76mev is predicted , its relative intensity is underestimated .",
    "furthermore both the position in energy and the relative intensity of the main peak at 54mev are overestimated .",
    "the fact that the 54mev peak is overestimated in energy at 56.4mev is especially interesting as the energy of the c@xmath3 modes are sensitive to the occupation of the @xmath4 band : as the @xmath4 band is populated these mode soften.@xcite furthermore , a softening of the raman active c@xmath3 phonon at @xmath40 @xmath20 0 has been shown , to correlate with the increase in @xmath1 in bac@xmath0 , src@xmath0 , ybc@xmath0 , to cac@xmath0.@xcite this mode softens from 60mev in bac@xmath0 to 54mev in cac@xmath0 .",
    "the measurement of the energy of this optical phonon in this study is thus important and could suggest that the amount of charge in the @xmath4 band is underestimated by the dft model . further inelastic neutron scattering or inelastic x - ray scattering experiments measuring the c@xmath3 phonons could be particularly interesting .",
    "[ fig:2024](b ) displays the analysis performed for this scan .",
    "the majority of the neutron scattering intensity from 30 - 90mev comes from the ( 0 2 24 ) direction and the five other symmetry related points .",
    "the temperature dependence of a phonon spectrum can often provide information regarding the origin of the phonon linewidth .",
    "for example , electron - phonon coupling such as that seen in ref .   typically leads to temperature - independent linewidths , while anharmonic effects usually lead to a reduction in linewidth at low temperatures .",
    "studying such a change in linewidth using the triple axis mode of in1 is rather limited by the flux of the instrument .",
    "so the scans in figs .",
    "[ fig:600 ] and [ fig:2024 ] could only be performed at 5 and 20k , which proved identical . as an alternative approach we chose to look for temperature dependent effects in the phonon spectrum by operating in1 in",
    "the be filter mode .",
    "in this mode a block of beryllium is placed between the sample and the detector , this absorbed all neutrons with energy @xmath41 5.2mev .",
    "the large aperture means that a large proportion of @xmath15 is sampled and a larger neutron flux is registered at the detector , making a complete temperature dependent study practical .",

    "( c ) the theoretical phonon dos of graphite @xcite shown for comparison with cac@xmath0.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the beryllium filter spectrometer was used to measure the c@xmath2 phonons at a range of temperatures between 5 - 300k .",
    "figure [ fig : phdos](a ) displays two measurements at the extremes of the temperature range 5 and 300k , where the spectra has been corrected for the small changes due to the bose - einstein factor in the neutron scattering cross section .",
    "the error bars shown are representative of the error bars on all points . within the experimental error",
    "there is no significant change to the spectrum .",
    "a much higher resolution study using , for example , inelastic x - ray scattering might prove a fruitful method to search for any more subtle changes in the spectrum .",
    "for this measurement , the sample was oriented such that @xmath15 was approximately parallel to the c - axis , however , due to the large aperture significant in - plane @xmath15 was also sampled .",
    "the measured spectrum has strong similarities to the published density of states calculations from refs .",
    "reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : phdos](b ) , but the uneven @xmath15 sampling leads to some phonon modes appearing more strongly in the experimental measurement .",

    "[ fig : phdos](c ) the calculated phonon density of states of graphite @xcite is plotted for comparison with cac@xmath0 .",
    "we see that the main peak in graphite is at higher energy than the peak in cac@xmath0 , because the ca atoms act to dope the graphene sheets in cac@xmath0 which increases the c - c bond length@xcite and softens the phonons .",
    "other changes to the graphene sheets , such as rolling the sheets to make carbon nanotubes , have a much weaker effect on the high energy phonons .",
    "for example , the phonon density of states for single walled carbon nanotubes the 150 - 200mev energy range is similar to that of graphite.@xcite",
    "we have performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments to measure the high energy c@xmath3 and c@xmath2 phonons in cac@xmath0 . due to the highly textured nature of these samples ,",
    "detailed calculations were required to make the comparison between experiment and density functional theory ( dft ) predictions . despite the differences discussed ,",
    "overall for both the c@xmath2 and the c@xmath3 phonons we find reasonable agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "this shows that dft predicts the phonon structure of cac@xmath0 reasonably well , which is significant in light of several conflicting papers @xcite .",
