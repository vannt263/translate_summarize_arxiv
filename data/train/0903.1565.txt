    "the magnetic properties of nanostructured systems are an interesting subject of research for both basic and applications reasons @xcite . in 1946",
    ", kittel @xcite clearly established that a single domain structure would be more energetically stable for particles below a critical size ( e.g. , 10@xmath6 m for iron ) , and nel @xcite pointed out that for such small particles , thermal fluctuation prevents the existence of stable magnetization , resulting in a superparamagnetic ( spm ) state .",
    "the so - called blocking temperature , @xmath7 , separates the spm state at high temperature from the blocked state at low temperature @xcite . for an assembly of identical nps with volume @xmath8 , the initial susceptibility in the spm state is given by @xmath9 and has a curie - law behavior .",
    "the magnetization of the assembly is then described by the classical langevin function @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the saturation magnetization and the applied field , respectively .",
    "although several attempts have been made to use widely the aforementioned universalities for characterizing np systems with excellent agreement @xcite , it is worth noting that extreme care should be taken in employing them in certain systems .",
    "actually , situations have existed in the literature where parameters derived by employing theoretical models for the experimental data deviated greatly from those extracted from real systems @xcite .",
    "that deviation was caused by several factors : namely , the broad particle size distribution , the different structural and/or magnetic phases , the local anisotropies , the interparticle magnetic interactions , and the interplay of spins at the surfaces and the inner cores of particles @xcite . as a whole",
    ", it is extremely difficult to distinguish which factors play a dominant role in the magnetic behavior for these complicated situations .    in the present report",
    ", we show a situation of superparamagnetic np systems in which the experimental data from magnetization measurements indicate a strong interaction among particles , leading to lack of collapsing of the conventional scaled anhysteretic curves into a universal langevin function .",
    "the np systems addressed in this report are perovskite la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) nps fabricated from initial oxide constituents by using a reactive milling method .",
    "the material is well known to possess the highest curie temperature of about 375 k and the highest saturation magnetization of 103 emu / g @xcite among the la@xmath14sr@xmath15mno@xmath2 colossal magnetoresistance perovskite family in bulk form .",
    "it has also been shown that because of the nature of the ball milling process , a nonmagnetic surface layer or disordered spin orientation exists at the surfaces of the nps , which leads to quite different contributions to the particle magnetization @xcite . for a suitable magnetic description of the milled nps , we used shell - core - type magnetic nps proposed by gangopadhyay _",
    "furthermore , the interparticle interaction was well described by using the mean - field approximation .",
    "as reported previously in ref . 8 ,",
    "the powders of lsmo nanocrystallites were produced by milling the mixture of the constituent oxides for various times from 4 to 24 h. the milling processes were performed by using a commercial mill ( spex d8000 mixer / mill ) with a combination of two 1/2-inch and four 1/4-inch steel mill balls .",
    "the structures of the nanocrystallites were characterized on an x - ray diffractometer ( siemens d5000 ) and showed that the nanocrystal of the lsmo perovskite phase had already formed after 4 h of milling . to study the magnetic properties of the nps , we chose the milling time to be longer than 8 h to ensure that the powders entirely consist of the lsmo - phase nps ( see the milling - time - dependent x - ray patterns for the lsmo powders in fig .",
    "1(b ) of ref . 8) .",
    "the mean grain size and the grain size distributions of the systems were determined by means of various techniques . a commercial win - crysize program packet based on the warren ",
    "averbach formalism was used to analyze the xrd data .",
    "the transmission electron microscope ( tem ) measurements were done on a philip cm20-feg machine at 200 kv . the mean grain size deduced from the xrd data ( @xmath16 ) and from the tem micrographs ( @xmath17 ) shown in table 1 indicated that lsmo particles had nanometer diameters that decreased with increasing the milling time .",
    "the disagreement between the grain size from the two methods , as already explained in ref .",
    "8 , is due to the structural domain formation in individual nanoparticles , which points out the limitation of the warren - averbach method in estimating the size of such systems .",
    "it is interesting to show previously in ref .",
    "8 that sem images taken on a jsm-5410lv system showed a cluster formation of nanoparticles .",
    "the nanoparticles inside each cluster can be observed using high - solution tem .",
    "this observation is important for demonstrating the strong dipolar interaction between particles . for studying the magnetic properties of the perovskite nanoparticles , we used a mpms5 squid magnetometer for the dc magnetic measurements in the temperature range of 5 - 400 k for fields up to 50 koe .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] presents @xmath18 curves measured at 300 k for all samples with different milling times . as seen in the figure ,",
    "the anhysteresic behavior is observed for all samples .",
    "the behavior is also observed for @xmath18 curves measured at temperatures in the range of 250 k to 370 k. this indicates that the np ensembles are superparamagnetic in this range .",
    "it is worth noting that the scaled plots of @xmath19 vs. @xmath4 for each sample do not overlap into a universal magnetization curve as desired for noninteracting spm systems ( see , e.g. , the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for the sample with an 8-h milling ) .",
    "the reason for this deviation is the dipolar interaction between nps , which leads to a collective contribution to the magnetization .",
    "such a system is termed an _",
    "interacting superparamagnet_. moreover , this behavior is evident in the thermomagnetization measurements .",
    "the dc susceptibility deduced from @xmath20 in an external field of 5 oe ( the inset of fig . [ fig:2 ] ) obeys a curie - weiss law , @xmath21 , rather than a curie law , @xmath22 , in the spm state for all samples , where @xmath23 is a curie - like constant and @xmath24 is the intersection of the linearly extrapolated line of @xmath25 in the spm region with the @xmath26-axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for the 12-h sample .",
    "we see that @xmath27 takes positive and large value for all samples .    by means of the law of approach to saturation",
    ", the saturation magnetization ( @xmath28 ) was determined from the plots of @xmath29 vs. @xmath30 by extrapolating the value of the magnetization measured at 4.5 k to infinite fields . as shown in table 2 ,",
    "@xmath28 was found to decrease with increasing milling time .",
    "magnetization values between 48.5 emu / g and 18.9 emu / g were obtained as the milling time was varied from 8 h to 24 h , respectively .",
    "the magnetization curves of such interacting spms can be well described by using the mean - field approximation with a field correction to the argument of noninteracting spm lagevin function added .",
    "the magnetization @xmath29 , therefore , can be expressed by an _ argument - corrected langevin function _",
    "@xmath31}{k_{\\rm{b}}t}\\right ) , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the langevin function of @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the average particle mass ( in g/@xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 is a parameter proportional to the mean field coefficient @xmath37 ( @xmath37 being equal to @xmath36 devided by the particle density @xmath38 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath39 is a universal function of @xmath40 .",
    "the two parameters @xmath28 and @xmath36 are , therefore , required for the scaling process to obtain universal plots .",
    "the former was determined as above .",
    "the latter was determine by using the experimental data for the initial susceptbility @xmath41 at low field .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath41 is expressed as the initial slope of the universal curve ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is a curie - like constant .",
    "we expect a linear relationship between the inverse of the susceptibility and the temperature in the spm region so that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath36 can be determined by extrapolating the @xmath44 vs @xmath26 curves as shown fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and by using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . @xmath36 and @xmath28 are then used to plot the scaled curves of @xmath45 vs. @xmath46 at different temperatures for all samples .",
    "as expected , the scaled curves overlap into a universal curve characteristic for each sample .",
    "the universal scaling magnetization curves for the experimental data of all samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "it is straightforward to think that the argument - corrected langevin function given in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) should fit the universal curve to determine the average particle diameter @xmath47 for each sample .",
    "actually , @xmath47 deduced from such a direct fit is much smaller ( about 2 - 4 nm ) than that estimated by using the tem and the xrd methods as reported in ref .",
    "8 . to understand the disagreement and to estimate @xmath47 from the magnetic measurements , a quantitave analysis of the particle structure",
    "is addressed .",
    "as forementioned , the decrease in the saturation magnetization with increasing milling time is due to the decreasing particle size during ball - milling .",
    "the reason is assumed to be likely due to the ratio of the magnetization contribution of the surface to that of the volume being higher in smaller particles . as a result , the much higher contribution from the defect and spin - disordered surface layer is released .",
    "the values much smaller than 103 emu / g ( the bulk saturation magnetization for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 single crystals ) is the evident for the existence of nonmagnetic shells ( dead layer ) surrounding np cores @xcite . the shells are poorly magnetic due to noncollinear spin structures or spin - glass - like disorders . a model of the core - shell structure for small particles is known to be suitable for fe nanoparticles",
    "@xcite and ball - milled nanoparticles of la@xmath48sr@xmath49mno@xmath2 @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the model is possible as a phenomenological hypothesis in the magnetic study of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 nanoparticles .",
    "the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 particle is assumed to be spherical and to be composed of an ideal single - crystalline core with a diameter of @xmath50 .",
    "the saturation magnetization of the core is @xmath51= 103 emu / g , and the density is @xmath52= 6.11 g/@xmath35 ( such values corresponds the values of bulk single crystals ) .",
    "the outer layer has a thickness of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , and the corresponding @xmath55 and @xmath56 values are roughly assigned 15 emu / g and 4 g/@xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the following expressions [ eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) ] can be found from the linear weighted average of the magnetization [ eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) ] : @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59^{-3}. \\label{eq5}\\ ] ]    it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) that the variation of particle saturation magnetization with respect to @xmath60 and the nature of core - shell - type particle result in a magnetic and structural dependence of the particle density in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the average mass @xmath34 is related to average particle diameter as follows : @xmath61    to deduce the average particle diameter of each sample , @xmath47 , we inserted @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) into the argument - corrected lagevin function in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , then called a _ magnetically - weighted argument - corrected langevin function _ , and then fit the function with the data of corresponding universal magnetization curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for each sample .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath47 for all samples can be shown in table 2 .",
    "as one can see , @xmath47 varies from 12.4 nm to 6.3 nm with increasing milling time from 8 h to 24 h , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows an example of a good fit between eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and the experimental data for the sample with an 8-h milling . a plot of the particle saturation magnetization versus the average particle diameter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath63 increases with particle size and approaches the bulk value for bigger particle sizes .",
    "this behavior was also reported by roy _",
    "et al . _ for ball - milled la@xmath48sr@xmath49mno@xmath2- nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "the decrease in the saturation magnetization with increasing milling time ( and , hence , decreasing particle size ) is likely due to the increasing ratio of the surface thickness to thecore size for decreasing particle size ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) as a result of the high - energy milling process .",
    "this was evidenced in our tem study reported previously@xcite . finally , once again , the mean - field coefficient @xmath37 obtained by dividing the extrapolated values of @xmath36 [ eq . ( [ eq2 ] ) ] by the corresponding particle density @xmath38 [ eq . ( [ eq5 ] ) ] is shown in table 2 .",
    "@xmath37 is found to be in the range of 175 - 88 , indicating a very strong interaction between particles .",
    "in summary , the magnetic characteristics have been determined for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 nanoparticles fabricated with different milling times .",
    "the analysis of the magnetic measurements using the mean - field correction showed strong interparticle interaction with high values of the mean - field coefficient , which was evidenced by tem / sem images and was due to particle aggregation into clusters .",
    "the universal scaled magnetization curves in the interacting superparamagnetism state could be described well by an argument - corrected langevin function .",
    "moreover , as to the nature of milling product , the magnetic nanoparticles showed defect nomagnetic surface layers . for a rough magnetic core - shell structure of the particle ,",
    "the magnetically - weighted argument - corrected langevin function fitting yielded a mean particle diameter in the range of 12 nm to 6 nm when the saturation magnetization decreased from 48.5 emu / g to 19 emu / g , respectively .",
