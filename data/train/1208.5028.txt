    "earth , venus , and to a small extent , mars all have clouds , therefore we expect that exoplanets in the habitable zone ( hz ) also harbor clouds in their atmospheres .    the climatic effects of clouds can be mimicked by increasing the surface albedo ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and subsequent work ) .",
    "although this method can capture the climatic effects of clouds and reproduce the observed pressure - temperature structure of earth , the measured global mean annual energy budget of earth can not be reproduced @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effects of clouds on the observed spectra is neglected by this approach . to address this issue ,",
    "the measured cloud properties of earth can be used in models assuming that the cloud properties do not change for different exoplanets @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to take the cloud heights and droplet sizes from observations , and fit the cloud fractions and liquid water paths in each cloud layer to match the global energy budget ( geb ) of earth @xcite .",
    "such models adopt multiple cloud layers in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "a parameterized cloud model is difficult to adopt for exoplanets which are not the exact duplicate of earth because the number of cloud layers , and other cloud properties ( such as the condensing material , height of the layers , droplet sizes , cloud fraction ) are all unconstrained parameters in the general case .    due to the large amount of observational and laboratory data available for earth ,",
    "detailed theoretical cloud models have been developed by the meteorological community and are available for 1d vertical ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we do not use these models because they are either too earth - centric and study one specific cloud type on a local scale ( e.g. , cumulus or cirrus clouds only ) , and/or they are too computationally expensive and thus not suitable for parameter space exploration .",

    "we develop a new 1d microphysical cloud model which is suitable for a wide range of planetary and atmospheric parameters for exoplanets in the hz .",
    "our cloud model has five free parameters , and does not add a significant computational overhead to existing 1d atmosphere models .",

    "sec : disc ] and [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we use a radiative - convective climate model @xcite that is coupled to a photochemical model @xcite .",
    "the radiative - convective model determines the vertical temperature and pressure profiles of the atmosphere in radiative equilibrium for a fixed chemical composition .",
    "the photochemistry code determines the vertical mixing ratio profiles of different chemical species in chemical equilibrium for a fixed temperature and pressure profile .",
    "the two modules are used iteratively until both radiative and chemical equilibria are simultaneously reached .",
    "the photochemistry code was originally developed by @xcite .",
    "it solves for 55 chemical species that are linked by 220 reactions and it uses a reverse - euler method to solve the chemical network @xcite .",
    "the climate model consists of two parts .",
    "the first part calculates the transfer of stellar radiation in the visible and near - infrared .",
    "the second part calculates the transfer of thermal infrared radiation of the planet . knowing the difference in the incoming and outgoing fluxes and the heat capacity of the atmospheric gases , we calculate the temperature change of each layer : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the temperature of the layer",
    ", @xmath3 is the time step , @xmath4 is the gravitational constant , @xmath5 is the total heat capacity of the layer that depends on the composition of the atmosphere , @xmath6 is the net flux propagating through layer ( difference between incoming and outgoing fluxes ) , @xmath7 is the pressure difference at the top and bottom of the layer .",
    "if the temperature gradient ( @xmath8  lapse rate ) in a given layer is larger than the adiabatic lapse rate , convective adjustment is performed .      to implement clouds into the 1d model ,",
    "we need high vertical resolution ( small @xmath9 ) , because clouds only occupy a small vertical portion of the atmosphere .",
    "typically the height of the atmospheres we consider are about 70 km with a cloud layer of a few hundred meters , although deep convective clouds around the equator can be several kilometers thick @xcite .",
    "therefore the number of vertical layers is a free parameter in our code and convergence tests are used to determine the appropriate number of layers to be used ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : conv_test ] ) .",
    "we decrease the time step of the calculations and increase the number of iterations compared to the cloud - free version code due to the high resolution of our grid ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : inicond ] for more details ) .",
    "we update the convergence test of the original code to examine the relative change of temperature and mixing ratio of important greenhouse gases between two successive calls in _ each _ layers individually .",
    "the radiative transfer module of the original code treated scattering on hydrocarbon hazes in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "we produced new optical data tables for liquid and icy water droplets .",
    "the new values were calculated for 80 different log - spaced droplet radius values between 0.1 and 100 microns .",
    "we assume that the liquid droplets are spherical and deformation due to aerodynamical flows around the droplets can be neglected .",
    "ices have a crystal structure that depends on the environment they form in , and the structure influences their optical properties @xcite .",
    "these shape effects are crucial in earth atmospheric sciences where observational data in good quality is abundant , but such effects are secondary in exoplanet atmosphere and paleo - climate problems",
    ". therefore we neglect these shape effects and use the equivalent sphere assumption .",
    "the complex refractive index value of liquid water @xcite and water ice @xcite is used to calculate the optical properties of droplets as a function of radius and wavelength using mie calculations @xcite . the absorption ( @xmath10 ) , scattering coefficients ( @xmath11 ) , and the asymmetry parameter ( @xmath12 ) of the droplets are shown on figs .",
    "[ fig : sca ] , [ fig : abs ] , and [ fig : gsca ] , respectively .",
    "these coefficients are converted into the cross - section area of a single droplet : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ( absorption or scattering ) cross - section , @xmath15 is the corresponding coefficient , and @xmath16 is the droplet radius .",
    "the asymmetry parameter describes whether the droplet is an isotrop scatterer ( @xmath17 ; light is scattered to all directions uniformly ) , forward scatterer ( @xmath18 ; analog of a perfect lens ) or backward scatterer ( @xmath19 ; analog of a perfect mirror ) .",
    "all of the above describe quantities are angle independent for spherical particles .",
    "the diagonals of figs .",
    "[ fig : sca ] , and [ fig : abs ] show that the absorption and scattering coefficients are larger than unity , if the photon s wavelength is similar to the droplet s radius . in this case , the cross - section area of the droplet is several times its geometrical area due to a resonance effect between the light and the droplet .",
    "droplets between 0.2 and 3 microns are strong scatterers but hardly absorb light .",
    "this wavelength range coincides with the peak of the solar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "however , if the star s sed is more pronounced at wavelengths shorter than 0.2 microns , or longer than 3 microns , the water droplets become more efficient absorbers .",
    "the amount of light scattered or absorbed by the clouds thus depends on the spectral type of the star as well as on the size distribution of droplets .",
    "the most significant difference between liquid water and water ice particles is that ice particles are strong scatterers , but less efficient absorbers in the thermal ir for sizes around 10 micron ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sca]b ) . due to this difference ,",
    "ice particles scatter the outgoing thermal radiation more efficiently than liquid droplets .",
    "we adopt and use terminology from the meteorology community in the next sections , therefore we clarify some definitions and explain some concepts .",
    "the saturation water vapor pressure is described by the clausius - clapeyron equation and is a function of temperature .",
    "the pressure dependence of the saturation vapor pressure can be neglected under atmospheric conditions .",
    "relative humidity is the ratio of partial water vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure .",
    "if the relative humidity is larger than unity , the air is in a super - saturated state .",
    "the amount of excess water vapor pressure relative to the saturation level is called the level of super - saturation . the saturation pressure relative to liquid water and water ice",
    "is calculated according to @xcite .",
    "if the atmosphere is saturated relative liquid water , it is super - saturated relative to water ice .    the process of condensation ( or nucleation ) can be heterogenous or homogeneous @xcite .",
    "homogenous nucleation means that the water vapor molecules collide with each other and spontaneously form stable water droplets .",
    "this process is not observed in the atmosphere for two reasons .",
    "1 ) homogenous nucleation requires extreme levels of super - saturation ( several times the saturation vapor pressure ) , however the super - saturation levels observed in the atmosphere are only a few percentage at maximum .",
    "2 ) small , sub - micron sized aerosols are always present in the atmosphere",
    ". the water molecules preferentially collide with these aerosols and are deposited on their surfaces .",
    "this process is called heterogenous nucleation . therefore , heterogenous",
    "nucleation removes the excess water vapor before homogenous nucleation could be initiated .",
    "these aerosols or condensation nuclei can be naturally produced by erupting volcanoes ( ash particles ) , bursting bubbles of salty water ( as a bubble on the ocean or sea bursts , the tiny droplets are transported away from the surface and dried by the wind to form tiny salt crystals ) , dust particles from the land , the agglomeration of various sulfate , nitrate , ammonium or organic chemicals , or bacteria and spores can serve as condensation nuclei @xcite .",
    "aerosols are also produced by anthropogenic sources on earth . the number density and size distribution of these aerosols",
    "can be measured on earth ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but their properties are unknown on exoplanets .",
    "therefore we assume that some amount of abioticly produced aerosols are present in all atmospheres such that heterogenous nucleation can be initiated .",
    "the formation of cloud droplets can be initiated by increasing the relative humidity above the saturation level in two ways .",
    "1 ) adding moisture to the air , or radiatively cooling it without displacing the parcel .",
    "this is how fog on the ground forms .",
    "2 ) increase the altitude of the air parcel .",
    "in such an environment , the air parcel adiabaticly expands and cools until the saturation level is reached after which condensation starts .",
    "cloud properties on earth are studied in detail using satellite measurements @xcite .",
    "large - scale features of earth cloud patterns in the tropics include the inter - tropical convergence clouds , the rising branch of hadley circulation with typically deep convective clouds , and the cloud - free descending branch of the hadley circulation .",
    "in contrast , mid - latitudes are dominated by low level clouds .",
    "clouds can form as a result of convection during which the height of clouds can be larger than their horizontal extent ( cumulus ) .",
    "opposed to this , clouds can be horizontally extended ( stratus ) or form thin threads ( cirrus ) .",
    "stratus and cumulus clouds can be formed at low , and mid - altitudes , and they are called alto - stratus or alto - cumulus in the latter case .",
    "cirrus clouds are ice clouds thus only appear at high altitudes favorable for ice formation .",
    "cirrus clouds can also form via convection ( cirrocumulus ) or form an extended horizontal layer ( cirrostratus ) .",
    "there are also towering clouds , which occupy more than one height ranges ( cumulonimbus and nimbostratus clouds ) .",
    "there are still many open questions related to cloud physics , and we mention only a few of these here .",
    "it is an active field of research how the relative importance of radiative , gravity wave , or precipitation processes influence convective clouds @xcite .",
    "it is not fully understood how the formation and life time of cirrus clouds is influenced by different nucleation and radiative processes @xcite .",
    "perhaps low level stratus clouds are the least well understood because their properties ( such as the height of the cloud base ) change by small and slowly varying perturbations in radiative forcing , precipitation , and evaporation of falling droplets @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that although these questions are crucial to study and predict the climate on earth , most of these questions represent higher order uncertainties when dealing with exoplanets and paleo - climate problems .",
    "the cloud model described in this paper focuses on the first order climatic effects of clouds , and it represents the first radiative - convective , chemical , and cloud microphysical model developed for exoplanets in the habitable zone ( hz ) .",
    "microphysical cloud models were developed for earth based on observational and laboratory data is available that constrain theoretical models ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two issues are important when developing a cloud model for exoplanets .",
    "1 ) calculating the vertical motion , condensation and coalescence of a droplet population self - consistently is computationally time consuming even in the 1d case .",
    "2 ) detailed observational data is not yet available for super - earth and earth - like exoplanets to constrain the initial conditions .",
    "we therefore limit our microphysical model to resolve some basic properties of clouds without attempting to simulate cloud microphysics fully .",
    "these basic properties are the following :    * the cloud base is located at the height where the local water mixing ratio equals the saturation mixing ratio depending on pressure and temperature . *",
    "as the convective parcel ascends , it cools and more water vapor condenses out . therefore the size of droplets increases with height @xcite . * the cloud top is located at the height where the relative velocity between the droplets is large enough to initiate coalescence .",
    "when coalescence becomes efficient , rain drops rapidly form and fall towards the surface .",
    "we do not directly simulate precipitation , only the formation of droplets because rain drops are removed from the atmosphere in a matter of a few minutes owing to their large terminal velocities @xcite .",
    "therefore the radiative effect of rain drops is negligible as they only spend a short amount of time in the atmosphere compared to the cloud droplets , which remain aloft .",
    "the falling rain drops however influence the number density of cloud droplets as rain drops sweep up the cloud droplets as they fall through the cloud @xcite .",
    "thus the number density of cloud droplets is reduced .",
    "this effect is considered in our model by the use of the precipitation efficiency parameter .",
    "we consider two vertical columns . in one column",
    ", the air moves only upwards and clouds form by condensation .",
    "the other column undergoes downward motion , therefore it is expected to be cloud free .",
    "the initial conditions for the cloudy column are the pressure - temperature structure and atmospheric composition in the convective zone ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the index of layers , @xmath23 being on the surface ) , relative humidity ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) and the number density of aerosols ( @xmath26 ) on the surface . from these quantities",
    ", we calculate the height of the cloud deck and top , the radius and number density of droplets as a function of height .",
    "we assume single - sized droplets at a given height , thus we do not follow the evolution of a droplet size distribution .",
    "this simplification is justified because the effective optical properties of a droplet size distribution is well represented by a single - sized droplet having the equivalent radius of the distribution @xcite .",
    "an air parcel on the surface becomes warmer than its environment , therefore it starts to rise and adiabaticly expands .",
    "if we assume that the air parcel does not exchange material with the surrounding air , the mixing ratio of water vapor will be constant as a function of height ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "* on the importance of entrainment ) .",
    "the number density of aerosols on the other hand will decrease as the parcel expands : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number density of aerosols at pressure @xmath21 above the surface , @xmath29 is the pressure at the surface .",
    "the pressure scale height of the atmosphere is 10 km , therefore the number density of droplets only slightly decrease at the typical height of low level liquid water clouds , but the modification is significant for high cirrus clouds which form above 10 km .",
    "when the mixing ratio of water in the parcel becomes larger than the saturation mixing ratio at the given temperature ( as described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the excess water vapor condenses onto the surface of cloud condensation nuclei ( ccn ) . the first layer where this happens marks the deck of the cloud layer . above the cloud deck , the mixing ratio of water is equal to the saturation mixing ratio in that layer .",
    "the excess water vapor density in layer @xmath22 ( @xmath30 ) is the difference between the water vapor density in layer @xmath31 and the saturation vapor density in layer @xmath22 .",
    "the vapor density is distributed uniformly amongst the droplets in the grid cell , and the mass of the water droplets in layer @xmath22 is @xmath32 initially ( below the cloud deck ) , the droplet mass is zero . the radius of the droplets as a function of height can be calculated and it increases with height in agreement with observations .    the reynolds number of the droplets is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the droplet radius , @xmath35 is the density of water ( 1 g/@xmath0 ) , @xmath36 is the terminal ( or fall ) velocity of the droplet @xcite , and @xmath37 is the dynamic viscosity of the gas @xcite .",
    "the reynolds number describes the aerodynamical flow around the droplet .",
    "if it is small , the flow is laminar , high reynolds number indicates a turbulent flow around the droplet .",
    "once the flow becomes turbulent , the relative velocity between two droplets is increased and thus coalescence becomes efficient @xcite .",
    "the critical reynolds number above which coalescence starts is chosen to be @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the cloud top is located at the height where the reynolds number of the droplet becomes larger than 200 .",
    "there are no droplets present above this height , as they would efficiently increase in radius due to collisions , and precipitate .",
    "the value of 200 was chosen because the droplet sizes at the cloud top is similar to the representative droplet sizes observed on earth .",
    "we discuss the effects of different critical reynolds numbers in sect .",
    "[ sec : crit ] .    falling rain drops sweep up cloud droplets during their descent .",
    "an average cloud droplet has a size of @xmath39 microns , an average rain drop is @xmath40 mm .",
    "the mass ratio of a cloud droplet and a rain drop , assuming spherical particles , is @xmath41 , thus 10@xmath42 cloud droplets must merge to produce a single rain drop .",
    "the number density of cloud droplets is 100 @xmath0 , and the number density of rain drops is 10@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of number densities is also 10@xmath44 , thus the precipitation efficiency is of the order of unity .",
    "as we do not follow the coalescence of a droplet distribution , we introduce a parameter called precipitation efficiency , @xmath45 , which can vary between zero and unity .",
    "the number density of cloud droplets is reduced by a factor of @xmath46 due to precipitating rain drops .",
    "the free parameters that determine this cloud layer are the surface relative humidity and ccn concentration , liquid water cloud fraction , and precipitation efficiency .",
    "this convective cloud layer is self - consistently calculated in our 1d model and it is physically motivated .",
    "such a cloud model provides a useful first order approximation on exoplanetary cloud properties , where the observational data in not abundant .",
    "however , our simulations show that for earth , where detailed observations of cloud properties exist , the resulting convective cloud layer for humidity and ccns can not reproduce both the average surface temperature and global albedo of earth .",
    "we find that a precipitation efficiency of 0.8 is necessary to obtain 289 k surface temperature , but the planetary albedo is only 0.21 .",
    "a precipitation efficiency of 0.2 is needed to obtain a planetary albedo of 0.3 , but the surface temperature is 275 k then .",
    "the reason why the surface temperature and albedo are not reproduced with one cloud layer is because the cooling effect of the low level water cloud dominates .",
    "if the single cloud layer were to form higher in the atmosphere , both the albedo and surface temperature could be reproduced .",
    "however , the only handle we have on the height of the convective cloud layer is through the surface relative humidity .",
    "thus , in order to raise the height of the convective layer , we need to reduce the surface relative humidity and adopt a value which is different from what is observed on earth .    in order to reproduce both the globally averaged surface albedo , temperature and the energy budget of earth , we introduce a second cloud layer : cirrus clouds which provide additional warming effect .",
    "the cloud deck of cirrus clouds can not be determined self - consistently in a 1d model because it is a result of horizontal motions ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : basic ] ) .",
    "therefore we use a parametrization to determine the height of the cloud layer .",
    "cirrus clouds on earth form typically at temperatures of 230 k , which corresponds to a height of 12 km @xcite .",
    "there are two possible ways to proceed .",
    "one can either scale the cirrus height relative to the height of the troposphere .",
    "the other possibility is to place the cloud deck where the temperature is 230 k. clouds do not form above the troposphere , thus the advantage of the former method is that it expresses the cloud height as a function of its natural maximum value .",
    "the advantage of the latter method is that a fixed cloud temperature corresponds to a fixed super saturation relative to water ice , and it also directly informs us about the greenhouse effect of these clouds .",
    "neither of the two methods have an overwhelming advantage over the other .",
    "however , we found in our simulations that linking the cloud height with the tropopause height sometimes results in non - convergence and continuous surface cooling",
    ". therefore , for pure numerical reasons , we use the latter method to determine the height of the cloud deck .",
    "the size of the particles as a function of height is determined in the next step .",
    "we assume that the air parcel is saturated relative to liquid water , thus super - saturated relative to ice .",
    "this assumption is commonly used in cirrus cloud models @xcite .",
    "the difference condenses onto ice condensation nuclei ( icn ) and the particle sizes as a function of height can be determined .",
    "the number density of icn is calculated from the same surface aerosol number density as for liquid water clouds for simplicity .",
    "the height of the cloud top is reached where the particle reynolds number is larger than 200 , as for liquid water droplets .",
    "the falling particles sweep up other particles as they settle thus reducing the particle number density .",
    "again , for simplicity we assume the same precipitation efficiency as for liquid water clouds .    as a result of our assumptions ,",
    "we only need one additional free parameter ( the ice cloud fraction ) to describe the second cloud layer . +",
    "once the particle properties in the two cloud layers are determined , we calculate the visible and ir fluxes .",
    "we use flux averaging to determine the equilibrium pressure - temperature structure for a cloudy atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the initial or previously determined t - p profile is used to calculate the radiative fluxes .",
    "the t - p profile and mixing ratios are kept fixed and the incoming and outgoing fluxes are calculated for four cases : cloud - free t - p profile ( @xmath47 ) , t - p profile with liquid water clouds only ( @xmath48 ) , with ice clouds only ( @xmath49 ) , and with both clouds overlapping ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "these four fluxes are averaged using the cloud fractions as weight and assuming a random overlap between the two cloud layers : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the cloud fraction of the liquid water cloud , and @xmath53 is the cloud fraction of the ice cloud .",

    "the upper pair of dotted lines show the ice cloud heights .",
    "convergence in all of these quantities is reached after @xmath55 climate iterations.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use the following initial conditions for all simulations performed in this paper . we adopt the physical and orbital parameters of the earth - sun system and initiate the simulations with the standard earth atmosphere composition : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the volume mixing ratio of argon , methane , carbon - dioxide , and molecular oxygen respectively .",
    "the rest of the atmosphere consists of molecular nitrogen ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "other important tracer species are water vapor , and ozone whose initial mixing ratio is set to @xmath62 in the stratosphere , and @xmath63 . the relative humidity is a free parameter in the code .",
    "however , we set it to 0.77 on the surface ( global average earth value ) for the convergence tests described in sect .",
    "[ sec : conv_test ] .",
    "most other chemical species are initiated with @xmath64 .",
    "the initial temperature and pressure profile is calculated as follows .",
    "the surface pressure is set to 1 bar , the pressure on the top of the atmosphere is @xmath65 bar representing about 70 km in current earth s atmosphere .",
    "the pressure grid is initialized such that it is uniformly spaced in log - pressure coordinates ( but see par . 3 in sect .",
    "[ sec : conv_test ] ) .",
    "the temperature on the surface is set to 289 k , the temperature in the stratosphere is initially 200 k. the height of the troposphere is set to 10 km ( but evolves during the simulation ) and the temperature in the troposphere drops linearly to reach 200 k at the top of the troposphere .",
    "once the pressure and temperature is known , the height of the layers can be calculated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and using the ideal gas equation of state .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : changes ] , the surface albedo of the planet was initially set to @xmath66 in the cloud - free model to mimic the effects of clouds",
    ". however , the clear sky albedo of earth is 0.15 ( chapter 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* based on erbe measurements ) . the clear sky albedo is the combined albedo of the gaseous atmosphere ( reflecting light via rayleigh scattering ) and the reflectance of the surface , no clouds are considered .",
    "the clear sky albedo in the model can be measured as the ratio of the outgoing and incoming visible / near - ir flux on the top of the atmosphere ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we set the surface albedo such that @xmath68 .",
    "if we follow this procedure , we find that the surface albedo has to be set to @xmath69 ( in agreement with * ? ? ?",
    "this means that 2% of the incoming radiation is reflected off the atmosphere by atoms and molecules in the clear sky case .",
    "the surface temperature is then between 292 and 295 k depending on the number of vertical layers considered ( see sect . [",
    "sec : conv_test ] ) .",
    "as this value is larger than the global average of 289 k , it already suggests that cooling effect of water clouds dominates over the warming effect of cirrus clouds on earth .",
    "the zenith angle is set to @xmath70 in these simulations .",
    "the time step in the climate model is adaptive and it is regulated by the maximum temperature difference in all layers ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "it is increased by a factor of 1.1 , if @xmath71 is smaller than @xmath72 k , the time step is divided by two , if @xmath71 is greater than @xmath73 k. these values are an order of magnitude smaller than in the clear sky model due to the finer vertical resolution in our model with clouds .",
    "clear sky calculations call the climate code 200 times , the photochemistry code 400 times , and the whole procedure is repeated 2 - 3 times until convergence is reached @xcite .",
    "the cloudy sky model calls the climate code 4000 times , the photochemistry 800 times , and repeats the procedure 20 times .",
    "the significant increase in iteration number is necessary because of the small time steps and different initial conditions .",
    "we illustrate the convergence of surface temperature , stratosphere temperature , and cloud heights on fig .",

    "the cloud model parameters of the simulation are described in the third convergence test of sect . [",

    "<S> one significant difference between the atmospheres of stars and exoplanets is the presence of condensed particles ( clouds or hazes ) in the atmosphere of the latter . in current 1d models clouds and hazes </S>",
    "<S> are treated in an approximate way by raising the surface albedo , or adopting measured earth cloud properties . </S>",
    "<S> the former method introduces errors to the modeled spectra of the exoplanet , as clouds shield the lower atmosphere and thus modify the spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> the latter method works only for an exact earth - analog , but it is challenging to extend to other planets .    the main goal of this paper is to develop a self - consistent microphysical cloud model for 1d atmospheric codes , which can reproduce some observed properties of earth , such as the average albedo , surface temperature , and global energy budget . the cloud model is designed to be computationally efficient , simple to implement , and applicable for a wide range of atmospheric parameters for planets in the habitable zone .    </S>",
    "<S> we use a 1d , cloud - free , radiative - convective , and photochemical equilibrium code originally developed by kasting , pavlov , segura , and collaborators as basis for our cloudy atmosphere model . </S>",
    "<S> the cloud model is based on models used by the meteorology community for earth s clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the free parameters of the model are the relative humidity and number density of condensation nuclei , and the precipitation efficiency . in a 1d model </S>",
    "<S> , the cloud coverage can not be self - consistently determined , thus we treat it as a free parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> we apply this model to earth ( aerosol number density 100 @xmath0 , relative humidity 77 % , liquid cloud fraction 40% , and ice cloud fraction 25% ) and find that a precipitation efficiency of 0.8 is needed to reproduce the albedo , average surface temperature and global energy budget of earth . </S>",
    "<S> we perform simulations to determine how the albedo and the climate of a planet is influenced by the free parameters of the cloud model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the planetary climate is most sensitive to changes in the liquid water cloud fraction and precipitation efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of our cloud model is that the cloud height and the droplet sizes are self - consistently calculated , both of which influence the climate and albedo of exoplanets .    </S>",
