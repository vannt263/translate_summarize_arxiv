    "however , dramatic deviations from this isotropic and two - dimensional behavior are clearly observed at lower fields , h@xmath31.5 t , manifested , for example , in a highly anisotropic field - dependence of the spin dynamics and interlayer - exchange - split spin - wave modes .",
    "particularly noteworthy is the observation of field - induced magnon soft mode behavior near h@xmath4 for a field applied transverse to the fm spin components , h@xmath63m@xmath57 , which reveals a continuous spin rearrangement transition at the antiferromagnetic - to - weakly ferromagnetic transition at h@xmath4 in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
