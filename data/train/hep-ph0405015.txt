    "there is a unique range for the solar mass splitting @xmath1 , determined from the data to be about 30 times smaller than the atmospheric mass splitting @xmath2 .",
    "the discovery of neutrino mass constitutes the only solid hint we currently have of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "there are theoretical arguments based on the stability of the gauge hierarchy which suggest the existence of physics at the tev scale .",
    "supersymmetry  @xcite provides an answer to both these issues which fits well with unification and string theory ideas  @xcite .    prompted by these data",
    "there has been a rush of theoretical and phenomenological papers on models of neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the most popular idea is to ascribe neutrino masses to physics at a large mass scale in order to implement some variant of the see - saw mechanism @xcite . broken r - parity supersymmetry provides a theoretically interesting and phenomenologically viable alternative to the origin of neutrino mass and mixing  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the case of supersymmetry with bilinear r - parity breaking  @xcite .",
    "this is the simplest of all r parity violating models .",
    "it also provides the simplest extension of the mssm  @xcite to include the violation of lepton number , as well as a calculable framework for neutrino masses and mixing angles in agreement with the experimental data @xcite . in this model",
    "the atmospheric neutrino mass scale is generated at the tree - level , through the mixing of the three neutrinos with the neutralinos , in an effective ` low - scale' variant of the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the solar mass and mixings are generated radiatively  @xcite .",
    "brpv can be considered either as a minimal extension of the mssm @xcite ( with no new particles ) valid up to some very high unification energy scale , or as the effective description of a more fundamental theory in which the breaking of r - parity occurs in a spontaneous way by minimizing the scalar potential  @xcite .",
    "this short review is mainly devoted to the generation of neutrino masses and lepton mixing , both the tree - level atmospheric neutrino mass scale as well as a description of the main features of the full one - loop calculation of the neutrino - neutralino mass matrix and its various analytic approximations which , in some cases , can be rather simple . for definiteness we will stick to the case of explicit brpv only .",
    "however , in contrast to the seesaw mechanism , in broken r - parity supersymmetry neutrino masses are generated at the electro - weak scale  @xcite .",
    "such low - scale schemes for neutrino masses have the advantage of being testable also outside the realm of neutrino experiments .",
    "although neutrino properties can not be predicted from first principles , their fit to the data allows for unambiguous tests of the theory at accelerator experiments  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the measured lepton mixing angles lead to well defined predictions of the decay properties of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
