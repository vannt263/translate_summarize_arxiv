    "to derive extinctions to each star , we implement the near - infrared color excess revisited ( nicer ) method described by @xcite .",
    "this method is a multi - band , maximum - likelihood approach for determining extinction to a background star based on the near - infrared colours .",

    "for each star in the target field , the nicer procedure produces an extinction , , and its variance , var ( ) , that considers both the variance of colours in the control fields and the photometric errors of the target star .",
    "the uncertainty of these extinction estimates , @xmath55 = @xmath56 , is dominated by the variance of the intrinsic colours of control field stars rather than the photometric errors of the target star .",
    "the median of derived extinction uncertainty values is 1.4 magnitudes for both the orion a and orion b clouds .",
    "there are several sources of contamination to identify and remove prior to folding the derived extinction values into an image to compare with the  column density image .",
    "as the orion cloud is an active region of star formation , one expects a number of young stellar objects ( ysos ) at various stages of pre - main sequence evolution within the observed fields .",
    "class i and ii ysos are associated with large infrared excesses due to the presence of a dense envelope or circumstellar disk that both attenuates the photospheric emission of the star and contributes to the near infrared flux from warm , thermally emitting dust grains .",
    "therefore , the extinction inferred from the infrared excess of class i and class ii ysos is not representative of the column density through the ambient cloud . in orion",
    "a , the degree of contamination by ysos is particularly acute near the orion nebula cluster .",
    "the catalog of class i and ii ysos generated by @xcite derived from longer wavelength photometry from the spitzer space telescope , is used to remove such objects from the list of background stars .",
    "a total of 2,456 ( orion a ) and 553 ( orion b ) class i and class ii ysos are excluded from our analysis .",
    "more problematic sources of contamination are foreground stars and class iii ysos within the cloud .",
    "both stellar types have intrinsic colours comparable to those derived in the control fields but whose light is not extincted by the full path of the cloud , if at all .",
    "the effect of including such stars in deriving the local extinction is illustrated in figure  [ fig5 ] , which shows a rare but extreme example of such contamination .",
    "values derived for stellar sources contained within a 1.8  @xmath61.8  area of the cloud are rank - ordered for clarity .",
    "the low extinctions determined for 5 stars is discrepant by @xmath1 20 magnitudes with the large  values of four stars as well as the equivalent extinction based on the  column density , @xmath57=/2.0 x 10@xmath58 mag@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "while such extinction differences could be due to intrinsic , cloud structure within the area of the pixel , we attribute these discrepancies to contamination by foreground stars and class iii pre main sequence stars that are surely present within the orion cloud that has been actively forming stars for several million years . using extinction maps of star forming clouds at varying distances , @xcite estimate 279 foreground stars per square degree towards the orion cloud .",
    "this corresponds to 0.25 foreground stars per 1.8  sized pixel .",
    "owing to magnetic activity in their atmospheres , class iii ysos can be identified by their x ray emission . a list of x - ray identified class iii stars in orion a",
    "( l1641 and ngc 1980 ) has been compiled from xmm - newton data @xcite . in total , 443 class iii stars from this list have 2mass counterparts and are excluded from our data analysis .",
    "the x ray survey of the orion a cloud does not provide a complete census of class iii ysos nor does it identify foreground stars . to isolate and remove additional class iii ysos and foreground stars ,",
    "we apply the following algorithm that conservatively leverages the additional information provided by the  column density .",
    "if @xmath57 is greater than an extinction threshold , @xmath59 , and the extinction of any star within the 1.8   pixel is less than a fraction of the equivalent extinction , @xmath60 , then the star is excluded from any subsequent analysis .",
    "optimal values for @xmath59 and @xmath61 are determined by maximizing the number of x - ray emitting class iii ysos identified by the algorithm . from this optimization",
    ", we find a@xmath62 = 8 mag and @xmath61 = 30% , which identifies 56% of the 443 known class iii stars .",
    "the algorithm is illustrated in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the solid line shows the @xmath57 estimated from  and the dotted line shows @xmath63 below which our algorithm would remove stars . following the removal of the contaminating stars , the mean extinction shifts from 8.7 ( dashed line ) to 18.2 magnitude ( dotted - dashed line ) .",
    "a more liberal cut by increasing @xmath63 and/or @xmath61 would increase the likelihood of removal of valid background stars .",
    "the algorithm is limited to regions with large  column densities .",
    "applying the algorithm to all stars , 2090 additional , potentially contaminating stars ( 1.1% of total ) are isolated and removed from the list of background stars for orion a. for orion b , 824 contaminated sources are culled from this list .",
    "contamination by foreground and/or embedded sources may still be present in regions of lower  column density .",

    "dark gas is more evident in orion a partitions 7 - 9 where the @xmath2 ratios are larger than the values in the self - shielded regime . in these regions ,",
    "the uv field is enhanced by the uv emitting young stars of the ob association as illustrated in figure  [ fig11 ] allowing for the destruction of co molecules while maintaining a large fraction of molecular hydrogen gas .",

    "they attribute these differences to the rapid changing co abundance in the diffuse gas regime at high longitudes of the orion cloud and the larger contribution by `` dark ''  material to the total molecular mass . while our observations do not extend as far as the gamma ray imagery , we derive an elevated mass weighted average @xmath2 of 3.5 /(kkms@xmath9pc@xmath14 ) within partitions 1 and 2 for which @xmath116 compared to the remainder of the orion a cloud where @xmath2=3.1 /(kkms@xmath9pc@xmath14 ) .",

    "@xcite examined a more extended area than that shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] and employed a different algorithm @xcite to account for foreground star contamination , which may account for the measured differences .",

    "the application of the galactic averaged value to an individual cloud can lead to 100% errors in the molecular mass .",
    "moreover , the scatter in the -  relationship ( see figures  [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] ) demonstrate that the varying environments within a molecular cloud can lead to even larger errors in the  column density .",

    "to which each regime is present depends on the local physical conditions  in particular , the strength of the uv radiation field and the temperature of dust grains . * in orion a",
    ", the measured depth of the pdr envelope increases with proximity to the centre of the orion ob1 association , which provides the primary source of uv radiation .",
    "this spatial dependence emphasizes the requirement of a self - shielding layer to develop significant  abundance values .",
    "the relative  abundance within the fully , self - shielded regime varies across the cloud from a minimum of 1.4@xmath610@xmath10 to 3.4 @xmath610@xmath10 .",
    "the maximum  abundance occurs near the orion nebula cluster . *",
    "the presence of co depletion onto dust grains depends on the local gas temperature that serves as a relative measure of the dust temperature .",
    "the observed dependence points to the role of thermal evaporation of co molecules from grain surfaces whose temperature is above a critical value .",
    "the regions closer to the orion ob1 association show less depletion , which may account for the higher  abundances found there . * assuming a constant  to  abundance of 2@xmath610@xmath10 throughout the cloud , the , lte derived column densities provide an accurate accounting of the  mass in layers of the cloud that are fully self - shielded .",
    "in orion , this layer comprises @xmath150% of the total molecular mass of the cloud . *",
    "using dust extinction as a measure of  column density , we confirm the reduced value of  in orion relative to the galactic mean value previously derived from gamma - ray measurements .",
