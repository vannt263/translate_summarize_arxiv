    "the chemistry of diffuse molecular clouds is mainly driven by ion - molecule reactions ( e.g. , van dishoeck & black 1986 ; le petit et al . 2004 ) .",
    "many of the intermediate species are ions , and because they rapidly react with neutrals ( especially h@xmath1 or abundant atoms ) and electrons , their abundances tend to be low .",
    "a major pathway to oh involves the intermediates oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath3o@xmath0 ( e.g. , federman et al . 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "these oxygen - bearing ions are especially important ; they provide a means to infer the cosmic ray ionization rate in diffuse molecular gas .",
    "this arises because cosmic rays ionize atomic and molecular hydrogen , leading to h@xmath0 and h@xmath4 .",
    "the hydrogen ions transfer their charge to o , producing first o@xmath0 and then the molecular ions oh@xmath5 through ion - molecule reactions .",
    "new , sensitive observations are now able to detect such intermediate species .",

    "sub - mm measurements with the @xmath2 space telescope revealed absorption from oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath3o@xmath0 from diffuse molecular clouds toward distant star - forming regions ( neufeld et al . 2010 ; gerin et al .",
    "2010 ; ossenkopf et al .",
    "neufeld et al .",
    "showed that the observed oh@xmath0/h@xmath1o@xmath0 ratio indicates that absorption from these molecules arises from material with small h@xmath1 fractions .",
    "the oh@xmath0 abundance relative to h provided an estimate of the cosmic ray ionization rate , consistent with earlier determinations .",
    "absorption from oh@xmath0 was also detected at near ultraviolet wavelengths through measurements acquired with the vlt / uves instrument ( kreowski et al .",
    "kreowski et al .",
    "suggested that oh@xmath0 absorption traces ch@xmath0 the best among the molecular species seen at optical wavelengths .",
    "we build on these earlier observations through a detailed analysis of oh@xmath0 and oh absorption in the near ultraviolet .",
    "while line - of - sight results are emphasized in earlier ground - based work , the focus here is on directions showing component structure with varying molecular abundances .",
    "we discuss results for vlt / uves observations of bd@xmath614@xmath75037 , hd149404 , hd154368 , and hd183143 because they reveal the clearest separation between strong ch@xmath0 and cn absorption . our previous work",
    "( e.g. , pan et al .",
    "2005 ) showed that ch@xmath0 absorption favors low density , molecule poor gas , while cn is associated with denser , molecule rich material .",
    "this separation allows us to study the chemistry of oxygen - bearing species in diffuse molecular clouds in greater detail than was possible before .",
    "data below 4000  , acquired with the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) of the very large telescope ( vlt ) at cerro paranal , chile , were obtained from the european southern observatory science archive facility .",
    "spectra of all four stars were acquired under program 065.i-0526 ( pi : e. roueff ) ; additional data for hd149404 and hd154368 were obtained under program 082.c-0566 ( pi : y. beletsky ) .",
    "both observing programs utilized the central wavelength setting at 3460   and a 0.4 arcsec slit .",
    "the uves pipeline reduction software was applied to the data in optimal extraction mode to produce merged spectra providing continuous coverage from 3050 to 3870  .",
    "finally , for each observing program , the individual exposures of a given target were coadded to produce a single high s / n spectrum . for hd149404 and hd154368 ,",
    "the spectral resolution is 3.8 km s@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , since the observations employed ccd binning of @xmath10 . for bd@xmath115037 and hd183143 , where @xmath12 binning was used , the resolution is 4.2 km s@xmath8 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "spectra of k  i @xmath14 were also used in the analysis .",
    "they came from archival uves data ( bd@xmath115037 ) , kitt peak national observatory coude feed data for hd149404 and hd154368 ( welty , unpublished ) , and mcdonald observatory 2.7 m coude observations for hd183143 ( mccall et al . 2002 ) .",
    "systematic fluctuations , with scale and amplitude similar to some of the true interstellar features and at very similar ( geocentric ) velocities , were noted near the wavelengths expected for the oh@xmath0 line in the extracted spectra of several sight lines . this apparent residual detector pattern is present even in the spectra of some stars with very weak absorption from other molecular species , where the oh@xmath0 line would not be expected to be detectable .",
    "the normalized spectra of those stars ( hd116658 , hd212571 , hd182985 ) were used as templates to remove the residual detector pattern .",
    "division by the template spectra generally yielded smoother continua and reduced noise near the oh@xmath0 line .",
    "the divided spectra were shifted to heliocentric velocities , combined ( for sight lines observed under both programs ) , and normalized via low - order polynomial fits to the continuum regions . for the four stars considered here , the s / n ratios measured in the continuum fits range from about 100210 ( per resolution element ) near the oh lines ( @xmath15 ) to about 390700 near the oh@xmath0 line @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting spectra , along with relatively weak lines of ch , ch@xmath0 , and cn , are shown in figures 1 through 4 . when cn @xmath17 was especially weak , the stronger line , @xmath18 , is displayed .",
    "total equivalent widths and column densities were obtained from the combined , normalized spectra by integrating the residual intensity and apparent optical depth ( aod ) , respectively , over the profiles of detected absorption lines .",
    "the @xmath19 uncertainties on the equivalent widths include contributions from photon noise and continuum fitting , which are generally of comparable magnitude for relatively weak , narrow , unresolved lines .",
    "column densities and velocities for `` individual '' components discernible in the profiles of various atomic and molecular species were determined via independent multi - component fits to the profiles ( e.g. , welty , hobbs , & morton 2003 ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes the results for the molecular species ; further details about the analysis on ch , ch@xmath0 , and cn will appear in welty et al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation , hereafter welty2013 ) .",
    "for the weak oh and oh@xmath0 lines , the total column densities obtained from the profile fits are consistent with the aod estimates .    for the most part , the molecular data adopted in our analyses are the same as those used in previous studies ( e.g. , federman et al . 1996 ; felenbok & roueff 1996 ; weselak et al .",
    "2009a , b ; kreowski et al . 2012 ) .",
    "however , the wavelength for ch @xmath20 and the oh@xmath0 @xmath21-value are taken from more recent work . the use of the wavelengths quoted by lien ( 1984 ) for the ch @xmath22 band yielded components that were shifted by about 2 km s@xmath8 relative to other lines of ch .",
    "this discrepancy was removed when the data of bembenek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) were adopted .",
    "as for the oh@xmath0 @xmath21-value , the value quoted by de almeida & singh ( 1981 ) and used by kreowski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is no longer the preferred one .",
    "the measurements of brzozowski et al .",
    "( 1974 ) , which were utilized by de almeida & singh ( 1981 ) , were affected by space charge , resulting in shortened lifetimes .",
    "these effects were analyzed by curtis & erman ( 1977 ) , who determined a corrected lifetime of @xmath23 @xmath24s ; subsequent measurements by mhlmann et al .",
    "( 1978 ) based on an independent technique and theoretical calculations by merchn et al .",
    "( 1991 ) yielded comparable lifetimes .",
    "the recommended @xmath21-value for future studies is @xmath25 , nearly a factor of 3 smaller than that considered in earlier studies .",
    "our total equivalent widths for ch , ch@xmath0 , cn , oh@xmath0 , and oh lines in the near ultraviolet are consistent with those of weselak et al .",
    "( 2009a , b ) and kreowski et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "we note , however , that their values are often somewhat larger than ours , due perhaps to the additional data incorporated here and/or to slight differences in continuum placement .",
    "the comparison is discussed in more detail in our larger survey of optical molecular absorption seen in uves spectra ( welty2013 ) .",
    "table 1 compiles the component structure for the four sight lines .",
    "the column densities for ch , ch@xmath0 , and cn are based on all available data ( welty2013 ) .",
    "the oh features are associated with the strongest cn components .",
    "absorption from oh@xmath0 , on the other hand , favors strong ch@xmath0 components and especially those with the highest @xmath26(ch@xmath0)/@xmath26(ch ) ratio ; these components tend to lack cn lines .",
    "kreowski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggested that oh@xmath0 is associated with ch@xmath0 , but their work focused on oh@xmath0 detections .",
    "figures 1 to 4 illustrate the correspondences involving the strongest components in oh@xmath0 and oh .",
    "some possible weak oh@xmath0 components ( at @xmath27 ) may be related to weak components seen in strong lines of ch , ch@xmath0 , na  i d , and/or k  i at longer wavelengths , which is representative of material dominated by atomic hydrogen .",
    "the likelihood of these being detections is discussed below .    as discussed in our previous work ( e.g. , pan",
    "et al . 2005 ) , different species have their largest abundances in specific regions within individual diffuse clouds .",
    "because ch@xmath0 is destroyed by reactions with both atomic and molecular hydrogen , as well as electrons , it is generally found in low density gas with small h@xmath1 fractions .",
    "significant abundances of precursor molecules are required for observable amounts of cn , so that cn probes denser regions with larger h@xmath1 fractions .",
    "the ch radical is found in both types of gas , but larger column densities are usually seen in material traced by cn .",
    "the same seems to apply to oh@xmath0 and oh .",
    "the connection between oh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0 ( and possibly neutral atoms ) indicates that oh@xmath0 detections also favor low density gas .",
    "thus , our optical results are consistent with the conclusions of neufeld et al .",
    "( 2010 ) from analysis of sub - mm data acquired with @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , absorption from oh@xmath0 and h@xmath1o@xmath0 in diffuse molecular clouds occurs at velocities most similar to those seen in 21 cm absorption .",
    "the inferred oh@xmath0/h@xmath1o@xmath0 abundance ratios imply h@xmath1 fractions less than about 10% . on the other hand",
    ", the association of oh with cn - rich gas reveals that oh is found in gas with higher densities , in excess of about 100 @xmath28 ( e.g. , pan et al . 2005 ) .",
    "that difference in behavior is consistent with simple chemical arguments .",
    "the intermediate species ( oh@xmath0 ) is rapidly destroyed by reactions with h@xmath1 , like the situation for ch@xmath0 .",
    "the production of oh from oh@xmath0 requires additional steps : reactions involving h@xmath1 lead first to h@xmath1o@xmath0 and then h@xmath3o@xmath0 , followed by dissociative recombination ( h@xmath29o@xmath0 @xmath30 e ) .",
    "denser gas also usually has greater amounts of extinction , which diminishes the effects of oh photodissociation .",
    "this pictures runs counter to models that produce oh in gas heated by turbulent dissipation ( e.g. , godard et al . 2009 ) , heated by transient microstructure ( cecchi - pestellini et al .",
    "2009 ) , or affected by the injection of hot h@xmath1 ( e.g. , cecchi - pestellini et al . 2012 ) because oh is associated with ch@xmath0 in these models .",
    "furthermore , a clearer picture emerges for the similarity in component structures seen in cn and co spectra for directions with @xmath26(co ) @xmath31 few @xmath32 @xmath33 ( e.g. , pan et al . 2005 ; sonnentrucker et al . 2007 ; sheffer et al .",
    "2008 ) . in such diffuse molecular clouds",
    ", co arises from a series of reactions initiated by c@xmath0 @xmath30 oh @xmath34 co@xmath0 @xmath30 h , followed by production of hco@xmath0 and then co through dissociative recombination .",
    "thus , while oh@xmath0 occasionally is seen in denser components , it is efficiently consumed there in the chain leading to oh and co.    instead , most of the production of oh , as well as all of the oh@xmath0 , therefore appears to be tied to cosmic ray ionization . that behavior allows us to estimate the cosmic ray ionization rate in the components shown in table 1 .",
    "our analysis is based on the rate equations in appendix of federman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . while these expressions do not incorporate the effects of pah species on ionization , hollenbach et al .",
    "( 2012 ) included these effects in their modeling , allowing us to estimate the changes that would occur .",
    "we rely on rates and rate coefficients given in federman et al . for the most part , but update the dissociative recombination coefficients and branching fractions when necessary from the compilation of florescu - mitchell & mitchell ( 2006 ) . the theoretical study of charge exchange between h@xmath0 and o by stancil et al .",
    "( 1999 ) produces a rate coefficient very similar to the one used by us previously when a temperature of 80 k is considered .",
    "a gas density of 100 @xmath28 is adopted here .",
    "the complete list of inputs can be found in welty2013 .",
    "the starting point is the steady - state rate equation for oh@xmath0 in terms of fractional abundances , @xmath35(x ) given by    @xmath36    where @xmath37",
    "are rate coefficents , @xmath38 is the primary cosmic ray ionization rate ( equal to 0.5 @xmath39 given in indriolo & mccall 2012 ) , @xmath40(he@xmath0 ) is the rate coefficient for he@xmath0 recombination , @xmath41 is the ionization fraction , and @xmath42 is the gas density [ @xmath42(h ) @xmath30 2 @xmath42(h@xmath1 ) ] . for the gas rich in oh@xmath0",
    ", we adopt @xmath35(h ) = 10@xmath35(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "the ionization fraction is taken to be @xmath43 , so that it is slightly larger than only counting electrons from carbon ionization .",
    "solving for @xmath38 with the rate coefficients noted above yields @xmath38 @xmath44 @xmath45  @xmath26(oh@xmath0)/@xmath26(h ) , where @xmath26(h ) equals @xmath26(h  i ) + 2@xmath26(h@xmath1 ) . for comparison , hollenbach et al .",
    "( 2012 ) provide a similar expression with a factor of @xmath46 for our adopted temperature and density .",
    "the final step is the determination of @xmath26(h ) . for hd149404 and hd154368 ,",
    "values are available from diplas & savage ( 1994 ) and rachford et al .",
    "for the other directions , we estimated @xmath26(h ) from the total k  i column density , using the relationship in welty & hobbs ( 2001 ) .",
    "we are confident in these estimates because the relationship gives values for @xmath26(h ) toward hd149404 and hd154368 within about 10% of the measured values .",
    "finally , we estimate @xmath26(h ) for each component by determining its fraction of the total @xmath26(k  i ) multiplied by the total @xmath26(h ) .",
    "while this step is less secure , the relationship in welty & hobbs spans the range for most of the values considered here .    for oh , we consider @xmath35(h ) = @xmath35(h@xmath1 ) , @xmath47 = 50 k , and @xmath42 = 300 @xmath28 , because its absorption appears to be associated with denser gas",

    "our estimate for @xmath38 ranges from 0.2 to @xmath52 s@xmath8 ( see last two columns ) , consistent with other recent determinations .",
    "for the one component with both oh@xmath0 and oh , that toward bd@xmath53 at about 5 km s@xmath8 , the estimate from oh@xmath0 is @xmath54 s@xmath8 , while that from oh is @xmath55 s@xmath8 .",
    "they can be made to agree with slightly different values for @xmath42 ( suggesting that the conditions vary along the line of sight because different conditions were adopted for the two estimates ) .",
    "for that matter , all the estimates for a given sight line could be make consistent by slight changes of order a factor of a few in @xmath42 .",
    "such relatively small changes are not unreasonable in light of earlier analyses of similar material .",
    "zsarg & federman ( 2003 ) inferred densities of about 10 to a few hundred @xmath28 from neutral carbon excitation for directions with chemical conditions like those seen here for the oh@xmath0 components .",
    "similarly , densities between about 100 and 1000 @xmath28 seem appropriate for gas rich in cn ( e.g. , sheffer et al .",
    "for instance , c@xmath1 excitation for these clouds typically yields densities of 200 to 400 @xmath28 ( e.g. , sonnentrucker et al .",
    "thus , these diffuse molecular clouds have primary cosmic ray ionization rates of about @xmath56 s@xmath8 .",
    "the exceptions to these results are the components only tentatively detected in oh@xmath0 ( and atomic species ) .",
    "they suggest ionization rates greater than about @xmath57 s@xmath8 and are deemed suspect .",
    "we can compare our estimates for @xmath38 with others . from analyses of h@xmath4 absorption , indriolo & mccall ( 2012 ) found values ranging from @xmath58 to about @xmath57 s@xmath8 , with the detections having uncertainties of 50% .",
    "in particular , indriolo & mccall obtained ( in units of @xmath59 s@xmath8 ) @xmath58 ( bd@xmath53 ) , @xmath60 ( hd149404 ) , @xmath61 ( hd154368 ) , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the @xmath64 and @xmath65 km s@xmath8 components toward hd183143 .",
    "the general agreement is encouraging and could be made better by using the same set of physical conditions .",
    "hollenbach et al .",
    "( 2012 ) provide an analytic expression for the oh@xmath0 abundance in diffuse molecular clouds that includes pah species in the ionization balance .",
    "for @xmath47 of 80 k , their relationship for @xmath38 is @xmath46  @xmath26(oh@xmath0)/@xmath26(h ) , with a proportionality constant about 3 times larger than ours .",

    "<S> this distinction provides new constraints on oh chemistry in these clouds . since ch@xmath0 detections favor low - density gas with small fractions of molecular hydrogen </S>",

    "<S> our observed correspondence indicates that the cosmic ray ionization rate derived from these measurements pertains to mainly atomic gas . </S>",
    "<S> the association of oh absorption with gas rich in cn is attributed to the need for high enough density and molecular fraction before detectable amounts are seen . </S>",
