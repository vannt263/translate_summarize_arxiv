    "discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite has made up for the last piece of the standard model ( sm ) in terms of the particle content , though the higgs physics such as the coupling property is still uncertain .",
    "the higgs boson in the sm plays the important role for the electroweak symmetry breaking , which is triggered by the nonzero vacuum expectation value of the higgs field with the negative mass - squared .",
    "the higgs mass term can be necessarily introduced once the higgs field is put in , due to the renormalizability upon which the sm has been established .",
    "however , the higgs mass term still involves unsatisfactory ingredients on the theoretical ground : one is called the gauge hierarchy problem , that is what we need to answer : how to stabilize the electroweak vacuum .",
    "the other , which would be correlated with the former , is the origin of the `` negative''-mass squared , which is simply assumed in the sm without any dynamical concept .",
    "one intriguing idea to solve those problems is to assume the classical - scale invariance in the sm . in this approach",
    ", there is no dimensionful parameter at a classical level , so one does not need to take care of quadratic divergent terms regarding the renormalization of the higgs boson mass : thus no scale is present in the model , which would be anomalously generated , e.g. , via the radiative breaking .",
    "the classical - scale symmetry is then broken by the coleman - weinberg mechanism  @xcite , which generates the mass scale via dimensional transmutation .",
    "actually , such a radiative - breaking scenario does not work solely within the sm itself , due to the presence of the heavy top quark , so one is eventually forced to add extra degrees of freedom to trigger the radiative breaking as desired .",
    "one of the way out along this approach would be to extend the sm gauge symmetry by introducing an extra @xmath3 gauge symmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , most of such models suffer from an ad hoc assumption : one requires to assume the sign of the quartic coupling between the sm higgs boson and an additional scalar field to be negative .",
    "this  sign problem \" can be solved in a way of a dynamical mechanism , which is called bosonic seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism itself is essentially analogue to the usual type - i seesaw mechanism , well - known in addressing the neutrino sector .",
    "the key point to note is that in the case of fermions , the phase of mass term can be absorbed by redefinition of the fermion fields , just by the @xmath4 phase rotation .",
    "in contrast , the phase can not be removed by any ways for boson mass terms , rather will be physical once the negative sign shows up in the bosonic sector .",
    "thus models having the bosonic seesaw mechanism built based on the classical - scale invariance can realize the desired situation in which the problems raised above can be settled down by a dynamical explanation .",
    "recently , such a hybrid model encoding both the classical - scale invariance and bosonic seesaw mechanism has been proposed  @xcite . the model in ref .",
    "@xcite is constructed based on the classically - scale invariant sm plus a vector - like strongly coupled sector , which we call hypercolor ( hc ) ( which was originally quoted as  technicolor \" in ref .  @xcite ) . in the model",
    "the classical - scale invariance is dynamically broken by the vector - like condensation of the hc fermion bilinear , triggered by the strongly coupled hc , in a way analogous to qcd .",
    "the negative mass - squared of the higgs is induced by the bosonic seesaw mechanism through the mixing between the elementary higgs doublet and the composite - hc higgs doublet formed as the hc fermion bound state .",
    "thus , the hc dynamics plays the essential role to solve both the gauge hierarchy and negative - mass squared problems .    in the model of",
    "@xcite the success of the bosonic seesaw by the hc dynamics is subject to the presence of the  chiral \" symmetry carried by the hc fermions , which is partially vector - like gauged by the electroweak charges to provide the composite - hc higgs doublet with the appropriate sm charges .",
    "when the hc fermion condensate develops to be nonzero , the  chiral \" symmetry is dynamically broken down to the vectorial subgroup , at the same time the scale symmetry is broken .",
    "this leads to a couple of nambu - goldstone bosons ( hc pions ) .",
    "the origin of mass for the hc pions in the model of  @xcite is responsible for a pseudoscalar @xmath0 , having the yukawa coupling to the hc fermions explicitly breaking the  chiral \" symmetry : the pseudoscalar @xmath0 develops the nonzero vacuum expectation value as the direct consequence of the bosonic seesaw , to give the hc pion masses via the yukawa coupling , hence acts as another  higgs \" for the hc pions .",
    "thus , discovering the pseudoscalar @xmath0 as well as the hc pions is a direct probe and a smoking - gun for this bosonic seesaw model .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the phenomenological consequence of the pseudoscalar @xmath0 linking to the presence of the hc pions , crucial for the bosonic seesaw model of ref .",
    "we find that , after the dynamical - scale breaking and triggering the electroweak bosonic seesaw at a tev scale , the fluctuating mode of @xmath0 , which is denoted as @xmath1 , develops vanishingly small couplings to the sm particles .",
    "it turns out , furthermore , that in close relation to the hc pion masses the @xmath1 mass is predicted to be very light and to predominantly decay to diphoton .",
    "we then identify the @xmath1 as a dark matter candidate like an invisible axion - like particle and constrain the @xmath1 mass by several cosmological and astrophysical bounds .",
    "the @xmath1 mass is thus limited to be @xmath5 .",
    "we examine the possibility of the cosmological productions of the @xmath1 and show that the @xmath1 is unlikely to be thermally produced essentially due to its tiny couplings to the hc sector in the thermal equilibrium .",
    "we then find that the sufficient amount of relic abundance of @xmath1 as the cold dark matter can be accumulated via the coherent oscillation , just like the invisible axion case .",
    "the detection potential in microwave cavity experiments is also addressed .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath1 with mass around @xmath6 can have the same level of the detection sensibility as that of the axion in the currently equipped experimental setup , so the @xmath1 is detectable by the microwave cavity experiments .",

    "in this paper , we have employed a model based on the classically - scale invariant standard model extended by adding a strongly coupled hypercolor dynamics .",
    "the dynamical breaking of the scale symmetry is triggered by the vector - like condensation at the tev scale , so that the standard model higgs acquires the negative mass - squared by the bosonic seesaw mechanism to realize the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "what is significant to control this model is to include an elementary pseudoscalar @xmath0 , which plays the crucial role to realize the electroweak bosonic seesaw , as well as to give masses for the composite nambu - goldstone bosons ( hypercolor pions ) : in this sense , the @xmath0 acts like another `` higgs '' in the theory .",
    "thus , discovering the fluctuating mode of @xmath0 , called @xmath1 , is the smoking - gun of the present model .",
    "because of the classical - scale invariance , the pseudoscalar @xmath0 originally couples only to the standard model higgs and hypercolor fermions . after the dynamical - scale breaking and triggering the electroweak bosonic seesaw , the @xmath1 thus develops vanishingly small couplings to the standard model particles , which arise only through the tiny mixing with the hypercolor eta - prime . in addition , it turned out that in relation to the hypercolor pion masses the @xmath1 mass is predicted to be very light and to predominantly decay to diphoton , so we have identified the @xmath1 as a dark matter candidate .",
    "the @xmath1 mass was then severely constrained by several cosmological observations , such as line emissions of x - ray , gamma - ray and cosmic - ray , no evidence for dark radiations , and a typical higgs inflation scenario .",
    "the @xmath1 mass was thus bounded to be @xmath215 .",
    "we examined the possibility of the cosmological productions of the @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath1 is unlikely to be thermally produced essentially due to its tiny couplings to the hypercolor sector in the thermal equilibrium .",
    "we then found that the sufficient amount of relic abundance of @xmath1 as the cold dark matter can be accumulated via the coherent oscillation .",
    "the detection potential in microwave cavity experiments was also addressed so that the @xmath1 with mass around 1 ev can have the same level of the detection sensibility as that of the axion in the currently equipped experimental setup , so the @xmath1 can be hunted by the microwave cavity experiments .",
    "+ several comments are in order : + the crucial deference between the @xmath1-dark matter and the axion - like dark matter can be seen by no evidence for observations probing couplings to matter , such as the test of gravitational inverse - square law and energy loss in stars like neutron star cooling .",
    "the @xmath1 coupling to matters can be generated at loop levels by the @xmath19 and @xmath68 couplings .",
    "as seen from eqs.([stationary : condi ] ) and ( [ masses ] ) , however , those couplings are extremely small , suppressed by @xmath216 or @xmath217 ( see also eq.([gs - val ] ) ) .",
    "hence one can conclude that there is no chance to detect the @xmath1-dark matter through the couplings to matters , in contrast to the axion case .",
    "thus , no evidence for observations with the matter - portal , but some signals identical among the @xmath1 and the axion in the line shapes and microwave cavity experiments would be a clear hint to distinguish them .",
    "( note that a dilaton - like dark matter signal in the microwave cavity is clearly different from that of the @xmath1 and the axion , due to the different type of the coupling to photons : @xmath218 for pseudoscalars , while @xmath219 or @xmath220 for scalars . )    as discussed in secs .",
    "[ s - dm ] and [ prod - s ] , we have assumed that the reheating epoch is associated with the higgs inflation scenario",
    ". it might be the case , however , that one needs somewhat large non - minimal couplings between the sm higgs and the scalar curvature for the reheating temperature in the higgs inflation scenario . in that case , the reheating epoch would be shifted , so the upper bound on the mass of @xmath1 , as estimated in eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) , could be affected .",
    "detailed study closely connected with inflation scenarios is to be performed in the future literature .",
    "the predicted number in eq.([power : s ] ) depends on the @xmath1 mass , so it does also on the hypercolor pion mass through eq.([s - mass - val ] ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the light pseudoscalar @xmath1 as a candidate of the dark matter is intact even if the hypercolor pion mass is not set to the present reference value , since it is solely tied with realization of the electroweak breaking via the bosonic seesaw : the mass has to be much smaller than @xmath28 , which is controlled by the small coupling @xmath221 in eq.([masses ] ) ; the @xmath1 couplings to the standard model particles , photons , necessarily becomes tiny by the same @xmath19 coupling strength as the consequence of the bosonic seesaw , which would suggest to regard the @xmath1 as a dark matter candidate ; the @xmath1 mass is then inevitably constrained by cosmological bounds , to be order of ev , as was discussed in the text .",
    "actually , the couplings of the s - dark matter are required to be extremely small : the coupling to hyperfermion , @xmath222 , from eq .",
    "( [ s - mass - val ] ) for @xmath223 ( which is coincidentally as small as the yukawa coupling for neutrino in dirac neutrino models ) ; the quartic coupling @xmath224 from eq .",

    "( [ masses ] ) with @xmath225 gev .",
    "the origin of these extremely small couplings could be explained by the underlying planck scale physics , which is , however , beyond the scope of the present study , to be pursued elsewhere .",
    "note that the realization of the electroweak symmetry breaking has nothing theoretically to do with the smallness of those coupling parameters , which are only related to the physics of the light @xmath1 including the mass generation of hypercolor pions and the property as the invisible dark matter .",
    "other signals characteristic to the present model involve not only hypercolor pions , but also the hypercolor eta - prime and hypercolor composite scalar states , both of which are expected to have the mass on the order of @xmath28 . as briefly studied in appendix  [ 750 ] , the hypercolor eta - prime can be produced at the lhc , via the photon - photon fusion process as well as the hypercolor pions .",
    "the discovery channels will be similar to the hypercolor pions : @xmath227 and @xmath103 modes .",
    "since the production cross section decreases as the resonance mass grows , the photon - photon fusion cross section for the hypercolor eta - prime significantly gets smaller than that of the hypercolor pions , so it may be challenging to search at the lhc ( for explicit estimates for the signal strengths , see appendix  [ 750 ] ) .    as to the hypercolor composite scalars , the couplings to the standard model particles are controlled by the tiny yukawa coupling @xmath228 through the mixing with the standard model higgs .",
    "it would be worth investigating how much large the @xmath20 coupling is allowed to be consistent with the currently reported heavy higgs search data , and to discuss the lhc discovery potential .",
    "such those topics are deserved to the future study .    in closing",
    ", in the present work we have so far focused on the possibility for the predicted light pseudoscalar @xmath1 to be a dark matter candidate .",
    "actually , another scenario can be made : with the @xmath1 mass around gev scale the @xmath1 could be just a long - lived particle having the lifetime much shorter than the age of the present universe .",
