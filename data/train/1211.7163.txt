    "nonlinear phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and have various aspects .",
    "an example is _ chaotic _ ( synonymously ,",
    "_ turbulent _ ) dynamics , in which few degrees of freedom ( d.f . ) generate unpredictable behavior ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in spatially extended systems",
    "where the number of d.f .",
    "increases with expanding the system size , weak nonlinearity can lead to spatial and temporal disorder . the phenomenon triggered by weak nonlinearity is called spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "there are several theoretical descriptions ( ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) such as the kuramoto  sivashinsky ( ks ) equation @xcite , the coupled map lattices @xcite , the swift  hohenbarg equation @xcite , the nikolaevskii equation @xcite , and the complex ginzburg  landau equation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , systematical understanding for the chaotic or turbulent disorder is still developing .    an experimentally obtained spatiotemporal chaos in homeotropically aligned nematic liquid crystals is soft - mode turbulence ( smt ) @xcite , induced by nonlinear coupling between the local convective mode and global nambu ",
    "goldstone one ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "smt has a characteristic spatial structure . because a patchwork - like structure appears on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane when the angle of the local convective mode is color - coded , the structure is called patch structure @xcite .",
    "the characteristic size @xmath2 of the single patch domain is several of convective rolls and decreases as the distance from the onset of smt as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the normalized voltage used as a control parameter for smt , @xmath5 denotes the magnitude of the applied ac voltage , and @xmath6 the threshold voltage of the electroconvection .",
    "we have investigated smt dynamics by measuring _",
    "net _ temporal autocorrelation function @xmath7 of turbulence - like dynamics in a steady state .",
    "it had long been considered that the simple exponential described the relaxation dynamics .",
    "however , we revealed that the relaxation deviates from the simple exponential at the vicinity of the smt s onset @xcite ; instead , it is well - fitted by the so - called kohlrausch  williams  watts ( kww ) function @xcite @xmath8,\\ ] ] employed to explain the relaxation dynamics in glass - forming liquids ( gfls ) .",
    "it is considered that the cooperative rearranging in gfls leads to the kww - type relaxation @xcite ; indeed , spatially and temporally fluctuating domains have been experimentally observed near the glass transition point .",
    "the phenomenon is called the dynamical heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "the characteristic length of the dynamical heterogeneity increases as the system approaches the glass transition point .",
    "although there are many studies for gfls showing @xmath9 ( i.e. , stretched exponential ) , the compressed - exponential behavior ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) has been observed in some gfls ( e.g. , refs .",
    "in particular , caronna et al . reported that the kww exponent @xmath11 increases toward @xmath12 with approaching the glass transition point @xcite .",
    "in smt , the exponent is unity ( i.e. , simple exponential ) at a large @xmath13 and increases toward @xmath12 ( i.e. , gaussian ) with decreasing @xmath13 .",
    "the non - exponential behavior of the smt s net relaxation originates from the patch structure .",
    "we have thus proposed a similarity between dynamics of smt and gfl from a viewpoint of the spatial structure @xcite .",
    "the temporal correlations of each wave number , i.e. , _ modal _ autocorrelation functions @xmath14 , are also suitable for studying chaotic or turbulent dynamics .",
    "mori and okamura have numerically and analytically discovered a dual structure in the ks equation @xcite ; the relaxation dynamics is dominated by the deterministic and stochastic orbits in the short - time and long - time region , respectively .",
    "we experimentally found the dual structure of the modal autocorrelation in smt and have theoretically revealed the mechanisms of the dual structure @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the spatiotemporal disorder in smt generates non - thermal fluctuations @xcite by which a non - markovian ( i.e. , memory ) effect is expected to play a significant role in the relaxation dynamics .",
    "we thus derived an evolution equation for the modal autocorrelation function in the projection - operator method for chaos and turbulence @xcite and have specified the memory effect due to non - thermal fluctuations .",
    "the numerically obtained memory function from the experimental results has suggested that the non - thermal fluctuations are separated into markov and non - markov parts , where the latter part was named turbulent fluctuations .",
    "the relaxation dynamics is consequently separated into three relaxation stages : bare - friction stage , early stage , and late stage .",
    "the bare - friction stage disappears when the dissipation by the turbulent transport has much influence compared to that by the molecular one ; subsequently , the modal relaxation in smt is represented as @xmath15 & ( \\tau^{(\\gamma)}_{k}\\ll\\tau\\text { : late stage } ) .",

    ", we uniformly argue the net and modal relaxation dynamics of smt and discuss the compressed exponential behavior and the dual structure from a viewpoint of the harmonic analysis .",
