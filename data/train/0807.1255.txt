    "the discovery of pulsars in 1967 @xcite showed clearly that their rotational stability allowed them to be used as astronomical clocks .",
    "this became even more obvious after discovery of the millisecond pulsar psr b1937 + 21 in 1982 @xcite .",
    "now a typical accuracy of measuring the time of arrivals ( toa ) of millisecond pulsar pulses comprises a few microseconds and even hundreds of nanoseconds for some pulsars . for the observation interval in the order @xmath4 seconds",
    "this accuracy produces a fractional instability of @xmath5 , which is comparable to the fractional instability of atomic clocks .",
    "such a high stability can not but used for time metrology and time keeping .",
    "there are several papers considering applicability of stability of pulsar rotation to time scales .",
    "the paper @xcite presents principles of the establishment of tt ( terrestrial time ) with the main conclusion that one can not rely on the single atomic standard before authorised confirmation and , for pulsar timing , one should use the most accurate realisations of terrestrial time tt(bipmxx ) ( bureau international des poids et mesures ) .",
    "the paper of ilyasov et .",
    "al . @xcite describes the principles of a pulsar time scale , definition of `` pulsar second '' is presented .",
    "guinot & petit ( 1991 ) show that , because of the unknown pulsar period and period derivative , rotation of millisecond pulsars is only useful for investigations of time scale stability a posteriori and with long data spans .",
    "the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite suggest a binary pulsar time ( bpt ) scale based on the motion of a pulsar in a binary system with theoretical expressions for variations in rotational and binary parameters depending on the observational interval .",
    "the main conclusion is that bpt at short intervals is less stable than the conventional pulsar time scale ( pt ) , but at a longer period of observation ( @xmath6 years ) the fractional instability of bpt may be as accurate as @xmath7 .",
    "the paper of petit & tavella @xcite presents an algorithm of a group pulsar time scale and some ideas about the stability of bpt .",
    "the paper of foster & backer @xcite presents a polynomial approach for describing clock & ephemeris errors and the influence of gravitational waves passing through the solar system .    in this paper",
    "the author presents a method of obtaining corrections of the atomic time scale relative to pt from pulsar timing observations .",
    "the basic idea of the method was published earlier in the paper @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] , the main formulae of pulsar timing are described .",
    "[ sect3 ] contains theoretical algorithm of wiener filtering .",
    "[ sect4 ] presents the results of numerical simulation , i.e. recovery of harmonic signal from noisy data by wiener optimal filter and weighted average algorithm .",
    "the latter one is used similarly to the paper of petit & tavella @xcite .",
    "[ sect5 ] describes an application of the algorithm to real timing data of pulsars psr b1855 + 09 and psr b1937 + 21 @xcite .",
    "the algorithm of the pulsar timing is widely described in the literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . two basic equations are presented below .",
    "expression for the pulsar rotational phase @xmath8 can be written in the following form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the barycentric time , @xmath11 is the initial phase at epoch @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the pulsar spin frequency and its derivative respectively at epoch @xmath12 , and @xmath15 is the phase variations ( timing noise ) . based on the eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) pulsar rotational parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be determined .",
    "the relationship between the time of arrival of the same pulse to the solar system barycentre @xmath10 and to observer site @xmath16 can be described by the following equation @xcite @xmath17 ^ 2+\\delta t_{\\rm rel}+\\delta t_{dm},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the barycentric unit vector directed to the pulsar , @xmath19 is radius - vector of the radio telescope , @xmath20 is a distance to the pulsar , @xmath21 is the gravitational delay caused by the space - time curvature , @xmath22 is the plasma delay .",
    "the pulsar coordinates , proper motion and distance are obtained from the eq .",
    "( [ tmt ] ) by fitting procedure that includes adjustment of above - mentioned parameters for minimising the weighted sum of squared differences between @xmath8 and the nearest integer .",
    "let us consider @xmath23 uniform measurements of a random value ( post - fit timing residuals ) @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is a sum of two uncorrelated values @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a random signal to be estimated and associated with clock contribution , @xmath28 is random error associated with fluctuations of pulsar rotation . both values @xmath29 and @xmath28 should be related to the _ ideal _ time scale since pulsars in the sky `` do not know '' about time scales used for their timing .",
    "the problem of wiener filtration is concluded in estimation of the signal @xmath29 if measurements @xmath25 and covariances ( [ cov ] ) are given @xcite . for @xmath30 , @xmath29 and @xmath28",
    "their covariance functions can be written as follows @xmath31 @xmath32 denominates the ensemble average .",
    "the optimal wiener estimation of the signal @xmath29 and a posteriori estimation of its covariance function @xmath33 are expressed by formulae @xcite @xmath34 and @xmath35 where covariance matrices @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are constructed as toeplitz matrices from the corresponding covariances . in this paper",
    "we assume that processes @xmath29 and @xmath28 are stationary in a weak sense ( stationary are the first and second moments ) .",
    "since quadratic fit eliminates the non - stationary part of a random process @xcite , their covariance functions depend on the difference of the time moments @xmath40 .",
    "since it is impossible to perform pulsar timing observations without a reference clock , for separation of the covariances , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , it is necessary to observe at least two pulsars relative to the same time scale . in this case , combining the pulsar toa residuals and accepting that cross - covariances @xmath43 produces ( hereafter upper - left indices run over pulsars under consideration ) @xmath44 if @xmath45 pulsars are used for construction of the pulsar time scale then one has @xmath46 signal covariance estimates @xmath47 .    in formula ( [ signal ] )",
    "the matrix @xmath48 serves as the whitening filter . the matrix @xmath39 forms the signal from the whitened data .",
    "the ensemble signal ( pulsar time scale ) is expressed as follows @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the relative weight of the @xmath51th pulsar , @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the root - mean - square of whitened data @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the constant serving to satisfy @xmath56 .",
    "the first multiplier in eq.([ensemble ] ) is the average cross - covariance function , the second multiplier is the weighted sum of the whitened data .    for calculation of the auto- and cross - covariances ,",
    "the following algorithm was used : the initial time series @xmath57 were fourier - transformed @xmath58 weights @xmath59 are the 0th order discrete prolate spheroidal sequences @xcite which are used for optimisation of broad - band bias control .",

    "power spectrum ( @xmath67 ) and cross - spectrum ( @xmath68 ) were calculated by the formula @xmath69 where @xmath70 denominates complex conjugation .",
    "lastly , auto- ( @xmath67 ) and cross - covariance ( @xmath68 ) were calculated using the following formula @xmath71",
    "to evaluate performance of the wiener filtering method as compared to the weighted average method , we have applied it to simulated time sequences corresponding to harmonic signal with additive white and red ( correlated ) noise .",
    "simulated time series were generated with the help of random generator built in the _ mathematica _ software which had the preset ( normal ) distribution for different numbers of pulsars .",
    "a maximum of 50 pulsars were used ( limited by acceptable computing time ) .",
    "the harmonic signal to be estimated was as follows : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the additive gaussian white noise had zero mean and different variance .",
    "for example , in simulation for 50 pulsars , the variance was in the range of @xmath76 .",
    "the correlated noise @xmath77 with the power spectra @xmath78 and @xmath79 was generated as a single or twice repeated cumulative sum of the white noise @xmath80 : @xmath81 the second order polynomial trend was subtracted from the generated time series @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the weights of the individual time series were taken inversely proportional to @xmath84 , where @xmath2 is the fractional instability @xcite .",
    "quality of the two methods was compared by calculating the root mean square of the difference between original and recovered signals .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the results of computer simulation described above .",
    "quality of these two methods of signal estimation is clearly visible .",
    "it is important to note that signal estimation accuracy in the case of wiener filter ( solid line ) is better in all cases .",
    "the most significant advantage of the wiener filter over the weighted average method is seen in the case of the white noise ( fig .",
    "1(a ) , 1(b ) ) .",
    "for the correlated noise with the power spectrum @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "1(c ) , 1(d ) ) the advantage is still clear .",
    "for the red noise with the power spectrum @xmath79 both methods show similar results ( fig .",
    "1(e ) , 1(f ) ) .",
    "noteworthy is dependence of estimation quality on the observation interval for the correlated noise ( fig .",
    "1(d ) , 1(f ) ) : as the observation interval increases , the estimation accuracy grows .",
    "physically such a behaviour corresponds to appearance of more and more strong variations of the correlated noise with time , which deteriorate the signal estimation quality .",
    "influence of the form of the correlated noise and length of the observation interval on the variances of the pulsar timing parameters are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "to evaluate the performance of the proposed wiener filter method , timing data of pulsars psr b1855 + 09 and b1937 + 21 @xcite were used . for the sake of simplicity of the subsequent matrix computations ,",
    "unevenly spaced data were transformed into uniform ones with a sampling interval of 10 days by means of linear interpolation .",
    "such a procedure perturbs a high - frequency component of the data while leaving a low - frequency component , of most interest to us , unchanged .",
    "the sampling interval of 10 days was chosen to preserve approximately the same volume of data .",
    "the common part of the residuals for both pulsars ( 251 toas ) has been taken within the interval @xmath85 . since choosing the common part of the time series changes the mean and slope ,",
    "the residuals have been quadratically refitted for consistency with the classical timing fit . the pulsar post - fit timing residuals before and after processing described above",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ res12 ] .    according to @xcite , the timing data of psrs b1855 + 09 and b1937 + 21 are in utc time scale .",
    "utc ( universal coordinated time ) is the international atomic time scale that serves as the basis for timekeeping for most of the world .",
    "utc runs at the same frequency as tai ( international atomic time ) .",
    "it differs from tai by an integral number of seconds .",
    "this difference increases when so - called leap seconds occur .",
    "the purpose of adding leap seconds is to keep atomic time ( utc ) within @xmath86  s of an time scale called ut1 , which is based on the rotational rate of the earth .",
    "local realisations of utc exist at the national time laboratories .",
    "these laboratories participate in the calculation of the international time scales by sending their clock data to the bipm .",
    "the difference between utc ( computed by bipm ) and any other timing centre s utc only becomes known after computation and dissemination of utc , which occurs about two weeks later .",
    "this difference is presently limited mainly by the long - term frequency instability of utc @xcite .",
    "the signal we need to estimate is the difference utc ",

    "pt@xmath89 is equal to 0.44 @xmath96s and 0.67 @xmath96s respectively .",
    "the accuracy of the smoothed signals was estimated as @xmath97 @xmath96s and @xmath98 @xmath96s . finally , for overall accuracy a conservative estimate 0.17 @xmath96s was accepted .",
    "the stability of a time scale is characterised by so - called allan variance numerically expressed as a second - order difference of the clock phase variations .",
    "since timing analysis usually includes determination of the pulsar spin parameters up to at least the first derivative of the rotational frequency , it is equivalent to excluding the second order derivative from pulsar toa residuals and therefore there is no sense in the allan variance .",
    "for this reason , for calculation of the fractional instability of a pulsar as a clock , another statistic @xmath2 has been proposed @xcite .",
    "a detailed numerical algorithm for calculation of @xmath2 has been described in the paper @xcite .    in this work",

    "the fractional instability of tt relative to pt@xmath0 and pt@xmath89 relative to pt@xmath88 is almost one order of magnitude better than individual fractional instability of the pulsars psr b1855 + 09 and psr b1937 + 21 .    as an example of astrophysical application of the fractional instability values obtained in this work",
    ", one could consider estimation of the upper limit of the energy density of the stochastic gravitational wave background @xcite .",

    "the upper limit of @xmath103 based on the two sigma uncertainty ( 95% confidence level ) of the ensemble @xmath2 is equal to @xmath104 .",
    "noteworthy , that since psrs 1855 + 09 and 1937 + 21 are relatively close to each other in the sky ( angular separation is @xmath105 ) and hence their variations of the rotational phase contain a correlated contribution caused by the stochastic gravitational wave background @xcite , they form a good pair for estimation of the upper limit of @xmath103 .",
    "currently , the accuracy of the filtering method without contribution of the uncertainty of the tt algorithm is estimated at a level of 0.17 @xmath96s .",
    "so , the uncertainty in pt@xmath0 may , in principle , reach the level of a few ten nanoseconds if it were to be used for all high - stable millisecond pulsars . as computer simulations show",
    ", for the highest advantage while applying the wiener optimal filters one should use the pulsars that show no correlated noise in their post - fit timing residuals .",
    "an algorithm of forming of ensemble pulsar time scale based on the method of the optimal wiener filtering is presented .",
    "the basic idea of the algorithm consists in the use of optimal filter for removal of additive noise from the timing data _ before _ construction of the weighted average ensemble time scale .",
    "such a filtering approach offers an advantage over the weighted average algorithm since it utilises additional statistical information about common signal in the form of its covariance function or power spectrum .",
    "since timing data are always available relative to a definite time scale , for separation of the pulsar and clock contributions one need to use observations from a few pulsars ( minimum two ) relative to the same time scale .",
    "such approach allows estimation of the signal covariance function ( power spectrum ) by averaging all cross - covariance functions or power cross - spectra of the original data .    the availability of two scale differences utc  tt and utc  pt has resulted in the long awaited possibility of comparing the ultimate terrestrial time scale tt and extraterrestrial ensemble pulsar time scale pt of comparable accuracy . the fractional instability of the terrestrial time scale tt relative to pt and their high correlation have demonstrated that pt scale can be successfully used for monitoring the long - term variations of tt .",
