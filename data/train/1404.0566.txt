    "the development of information technologies has inspired also the development of the information compression , the most famous part of which is the image and video compression .",
    "the compression is based on the information structure in order to optimize compression speed , compression rate and the possible losses of information during the compression .",
    "development of the theory of orbit functions opens a space for their use in the processing of the information sampled on grids in simplexes and polyhedra in @xmath2dimensional space .",
    "these functions can be used for decomposition of any discrete values on the grids to orthogonal series .",
    "the density of grid points is controlled by a suitable choice of parameter .",
    "moreover , we can glue together more simplexes and study the information carried in the grid in this ensemble . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the simplest non - trivial case of utilization of orbit functions in two dimensions .",
    "it corresponds to a two - dimensional digital image processing . in comparison with the most widespread method for image processing - fourier analysis , i.e.",
    ", the decomposition into exponential series in two perpendicular directions , we decompose discrete functions on points of the grid in a number of orbit functions without the division into several directions .",
    "our approach is a generalization of discrete fourier and cosine transform .    in this paper , we summarize the properties of @xmath3 and @xmath4orbit functions connected with weyl groups of simple lie algebras @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these functions are a generalization of the classical cosine and exponential function and they act in fundamental domains of the lie algebras . in these domains",
    "we introduce a discrete grid on which it is possible to define discrete @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbit transform . for an illustrative example of",
    "analysis and image processing we split a square image into two triangles and we effectuate corresponding @xmath0orbit transform .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 summarize some known facts about the spatial filtering using a convolution . in section 3",
    "we remind basic notations from the theory of weyl group orbit functions . in particular , we describe the discrete transforms based on finite families of orbit functions in subsection 3.3 . in section 4",
    "we define @xmath0 and @xmath1orbit convolution and we formulate the orbit convolutions theorems .",
    "finally , in subsection 4.2 we provide examples of image processing using @xmath0orbit functions .",
    "we include two appendices with technical details for the orbit transforms .",
    "a variety of filters play an important role in image processing , in image improving and in detail recognition . for example , the spatial filtering uses convolution of functions which is performed via fourier transform as a multiplication of the fourier images .",
    "fourier analysis is based on the decomposition of brightness values in each digitized image points along the rows and columns into fourier series .",
    "the fourier transform is then processed .",
    "the inverse discrete fourier transform shows processing of digital images . this way we can highlight some features of the image  remove the noise or enhance blur edges .",
    "the whole process is described in several papers , for an overview see for example  @xcite . for image compression",
    "jpeg the discrete cosine transforms are used .",
    "they are of four types and the convolution via multiplications in these cases is more complicated , it combines cosine and sine discrete transform except the discrete cosine transform of type ii .",
    "the simplest filtering technique is the averaging the light intensities at points .",
    "intensity of each new pixel is the mean value of the intensities of the 8 neighboring pixels and the pixel itself in the original image .",
    "other filters use the intensities of neighboring pixels multiplied by different relative weights and the pixel is assigned by a mean value of 9 intensities .",
    "other filters take into account a number of other surrounding pixels , 25 pixels together with the center .",
    "intensities in 9 or 25 pixel can be expressed as @xmath7 or @xmath8 matrix .",
    "averaging over neighboring pixels is mathematically expressed by the convolution of the original intensity matrix with @xmath7 or @xmath8 matrix , so - called convolution kernel .",
    "the elements of this matrix are the weights assigned to the corresponding pixel in the area according to the desired filter type . for the treatment of pixel intensities on the edge",
    "we need to extend a line above and below the picture and a column on the left and the right in the @xmath7 matrix case . in the case of @xmath8 matrix",
    "we need to add to each side two columns and two rows .",
    "filters mentioned above are called linear spatial filters . their application to a digital image",
    "creates a new image using a linear combination of brightness values in the surrounding pixels .",
    "the intensities of the digital image in each pixel are defined by the matrix @xmath9 .",
    "if we want to apply a filter comprising eight neighboring pixels with different weights , we construct the @xmath10 weights matrix    @xmath11 new digital image has the intensity in each pixel given by a matrix @xmath12 and their values are @xmath13 this corresponds to the sum of all the values of the @xmath10 matrix we get as a pointwise multiplication of the filter @xmath10 matrix cut around the filtered pixel .",
    "mathematically , it is a discrete convolution    @xmath14 for defining the orbit convolutions we proceed in a similar way as for the discrete cosine transform dct ii , where for two functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 it is defined    @xmath17 and for cosine transform @xmath18 the following relation holds  @xcite    @xmath19",
    "we consider the simple lie algebras of rank two , namely @xmath20 and @xmath6 .",
    "each of them is described by its set of simple roots @xmath21 . in the case of @xmath22 ,",
    "the roots are of the same length , for @xmath23 and @xmath6 we distinguish so - called short root and long root .",
    "we use the standard normalization @xmath24 for the long roots .",
    "coroots are defined as @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , we define the weights @xmath26 and coweights @xmath27 , which are dual to root and coroots in the sense @xmath28 . the weight lattice @xmath29 is defined as all integer combinations of weights .",
    "we denote the reflections with respect to the hyperplanes orthogonal to the simple roots by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 they generate a weyl group corresponding to each lie algebra .",
    "the action of @xmath33 on the set of simple roots gives a root system @xmath34 in @xmath35 .",
    "it contains a unique highest root @xmath36 , where the coefficients @xmath37 are called the marks .",
    "analogously , a root system @xmath38 is obtained from the action of @xmath33 on the set of coroots , its highest root is denoted by @xmath39 , the coefficients are called the dual marks .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the reflection with respect to the hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath41 and we define @xmath42 by @xmath43 the affine weyl group @xmath44 is generated by @xmath45 .",
    "its fundamental domain is a connected subset of @xmath35 such that it contains exactly one point of each affine weyl group orbit .",
    "it can be chosen  @xcite as the convex hull of the points @xmath46 .",

    "their complete description can be found in the series of papers  @xcite the family of @xmath0functions is defined as follows : for every @xmath56 and @xmath57 we have @xmath58 the functions are invariant with respect to the affine weyl group , therefore , we can consider @xmath59 only .",

    "see  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider convolution based on the @xmath0 and @xmath1functions , @xmath60function convolution does not differ significantly from the @xmath0function case .",
    "the method of discretization of orbit functions was described in detail in the papers  @xcite .",
    "the general idea is the following : in the fundamental domain we define a finite grid of points @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is an integer of our choice which allows us to control the density of the grid . a discrete scalar product of functions",
    "is then defined using this points .",
    "we describe a finite family of orbit functions which are pairwise orthogonal with respect to this scalar product by defining a grid of parameters labeling the functions .",
    "finally , we give the explicit orthogonality relations .",
    "appendix  [ ap1 ] summarize details about the choice of the grids .",
    "we consider a space of discrete functions sampled on the points of @xmath65 with a scalar product defined for each pair of functions @xmath67 as @xmath68 the weight function @xmath69 is given by the order of the weyl orbit of @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "the set of parameters @xmath72 gives us a finite family of orbit functions which are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the scalar product  .    for every @xmath73 it holds that @xmath74 where the coefficient @xmath75 is the order of the stabilizer of @xmath76 , @xmath77 is determinant of the cartan matrix of the corresponding weyl group and @xmath78 is its order .",
    "the values of @xmath78 , @xmath77 , @xmath69 and @xmath79 are listed in appendix  [ ap2 ] .",
    "the discrete orthogonality allows us to perform a fourier like transform , called @xmath0orbit transform .",
    "we consider a function @xmath15 sampled on the points of @xmath65",
    ". we can interpolate it by a sum of @xmath0functions @xmath80 where we require @xmath81 for every @xmath82 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath83 are equal to @xmath84    in the case of @xmath1orbit functions we consider the grids @xmath85 and @xmath86 . the scalar product is defined as @xmath87 the weight function @xmath88 is given by the order of the even weyl orbit of @xmath70 , @xmath89 .",
    "for every @xmath90 it holds that @xmath91 where the coefficient @xmath92 is the order of the stabilizer of @xmath76 and @xmath93 is the order of the even weyl group .. the values of @xmath93 , @xmath88 and @xmath94 are listed in appendix  [ ap2 ] .",
    "the @xmath1orbit transform is provided as follows .",
    "we consider a function @xmath15 sampled on the points of @xmath85 .",
    "we can interpolate it by a sum of @xmath1functions @xmath95 where we require @xmath96 for every @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the coefficients @xmath83 are equal to    @xmath98",
    "the main aim of this work is to define a discrete orbit functions convolution , i.e. , a mapping of two functions sampled on @xmath65 which respects a relation analogous to the classical convolution theorem .",
    "such definition comes naturally from the orbit functions discretization theory .",
    "the @xmath99-orbit convolution is for every pair of discrete functions @xmath67 and @xmath100 defined as @xmath101 such a convolution is well defined , the shifts in the convolution kernel @xmath16 respect the symmetry of the weyl group of @xmath22 .",
    "we can write the @xmath0orbit convolution theorem .",
    "let @xmath67 be any functions defined on the points of @xmath65 and @xmath100 .",
    "then @xmath102 where @xmath83 and @xmath103 are the @xmath0orbit transforms of @xmath15 and @xmath16 given by  .",
    "its proof is straightforward , it uses the relations   and the following formula for the product of an orbit function with the complex conjugate of an orbit function with the same label but different argument : @xmath104    analogously , the @xmath105-orbit convolution is defined for discrete functions @xmath67 sampled on @xmath85 and @xmath106 as @xmath107 the @xmath1orbit convolution theorem is then the following .",
    "let @xmath67 be any functions defined on the points of @xmath85 and @xmath106 .",
    "then @xmath108 where @xmath83 and @xmath103 are the @xmath1orbit transforms of @xmath15 and @xmath16 given by  .      for the purpose of demonstrating the differences between the orbit convolution and convolution on @xmath35",
    "we take an artificial image of a hexagon .",
    "three of spatial filters are presented : a mean filter , often used for image denoising ; a sharpen filter which is useful for contrast enhancing ; and a simple edge detecting filter which suppresses the monotonic ( in the sense of pixel brightness ) parts of an image .    in @xmath35",
    "these filters are described by matrices : @xmath109    the filters are constructed to be as similar to the filters used for orbit convolution as possible .",
    "there are some restrictions for the orbit convolution coming from its definition , the most significant is the summation over all reflections of the convolution kernel .",
    "this property is unpleasant , since it does not give us the possibility to apply changes in a single direction , i.e. , detecting only horizontal edges .",
    "for this reason we can not use all convolution kernels we can use for image filtering in @xmath35 .",
    "when developing a spatial filter for orbit convolution from kernel for filtering in @xmath35 we have to take the formula into account .",
    "many filters are supposed to preserve the average value of brightness in the image . in the frequency domain the related value",
    "is situated in the point @xmath110 .",
    "the normalization of the filter is done by dividing the weighted sum of kernel points by coefficients @xmath111 .",
    "there is also a second level of normalization , arising from the summation over all weyl reflections of a point , the filter is divided by the number of reflections . some filters ,",
    "mostly the ones based on differences , have the weighted sum equal to zero , thus not requiring any normalization .",
    "there are two major restrictions for the orbit convolution kernels : the reflection of the kernel , which disables filtering in a single direction , and the placement of the kernel center . for the convolution on @xmath35 the kernel center",
    "is located in the middle point of the kernel , for orbit convolution the center is in the point @xmath110 .",
    "this brings further restriction , the filter can not count with all neighboring points .",
    "filters for orbit convolution are defined in the following way :    @xmath112    for the orbit convolution demonstration we used the hexagon image , see figure  [ fig2 ] , and filtered it via convolution on @xmath35 and via @xmath0orbit convolution on @xmath22 group to have a comparison for similar filters for both methods .",
    "the results are depicted on figures  [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the differences between the convolution on @xmath35 and orbit convolution via @xmath99-orbit transform on @xmath22 group are very little .",
    "one of the reasons is the inequality of convolution kernels for both types of convolution .",
    "convolution ( left ) and orbit convolution ( right ) ]     ( left ) and orbit ( right ) convolution ]     convolution , on the right with orbit one ]",
    "1 .   in the case of @xmath23 and @xmath6",
    "orbit functions there are 7 more families of orbit function defined , the orbit convolution theorem can be formulated for each of them .",
    "this gives us bigger choice of the shape of the fundamental domain suitable for the image .",
    "the method described here can be generalized to weyl group of any rank .",
    "therefore , it can be used for more general problems than the image processing .",
    "3 .   the orbit convolution takes an advantage from the symmetry of the underlying weyl group . on the other hand , as there is no fast algorithm yet , the computation takes more time than standard fourier or cosine transform .",
    "one of our future projects is finding such a fast algorithm .",
    "this work is supported by the european union under the project `` support of inter - sectoral mobility and quality enhancement of research teams at czech technical university in prague '' cz.1.07/2.3.00/30.0034 .",
    "we consider four lattices in @xmath35 . the root lattice @xmath113 ; the coroot lattice @xmath114 and their duals @xmath115 and @xmath116 which are called the weight lattice and coweight lattice respectively .    two finite lattice grids depending on an integer parameter @xmath66 are defined as follows : we consider the @xmath117invariant group @xmath118 and we define the set of points @xmath65 as such cosets from @xmath118 which have a representative in @xmath52 .",
    "it can be written as      the explicit formulas are then obtained by using the marks @xmath120 and @xmath121 of the concrete group .",
