    "in the last few years a lot of attention has been paid to hamiltonian systems in which the interaction potential range is of the order of the size of the system .",
    "typical examples include nuclei , metallic clusters and galaxies . in the first two cases",
    "the system under consideration is small comprising just a few ( or less ) hundreds of particles , while in the third one the range of the potential is long @xcite .",
    "one of the main consequences of dealing with long - range hamiltonian systems is the appearance of negative specific heats .",
    "negative specific heats appear in the literature of small systems both in experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies .",
    "in particular , in a series of recent papers , we have found such a behavior for highly excited small lennard jones aggregates ( @xmath1 particles ) both free to expand and constrained in an spherical volume @xcite . in this case the standard ( @xmath2 ) @xmath0 systems in @xmath3 dimensions qualifies as a short - ranged potential , since the exponent of the attractive term of the potential ( @xmath4 ) is greater than the dimension of the system ( @xmath5 ) . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "it is claimed , based on the numerical analysis of two - dimensional systems , that a negative specific heat region is present only if long - range forces are present .",
    "it is therefore necessary to make a complete study in order to clarify the interplay between the potential range and the thermodynamics of the system .",
    "the presence of such a long range interaction in the system calls for a proper thermodynamical description .",
    "one can , for instance , try to use tsallis statistics @xcite .",
    "however , ",
    "small  systems can be also studied via micro - canonical statistics @xcite .",
    "our studies and conclusions will be referred to the @xmath6 ensemble .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the model , the interaction potential and the observables that we use in the calculations . in section 3",
    "we show the results of our simulations for two and three - dimensional systems .",
    "finally in section 4 we present our conclusions .",
    "the system under study is composed by a gas of @xmath1 particles confined in a spherical box , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath7 , where k is the kinetic energy and the interaction potential is given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 ( 0 \\leq \\alpha < 12)$ ] and @xmath10 the lennard - jones like potentials as a function of @xmath11 are shown in fig .",
    "[ vvsr ] for @xmath5 , @xmath12 , and several values of @xmath13 .",
    "we used a spherical confining wall via an external potential @xmath14 with a cut off distance @xmath15 .",
    "energies are measured in units of the potential well ( @xmath16 ) , and the distance at which the potential changes sign ( @xmath17 ) , respectively .",
    "the unit of time used is @xmath18 .",
    "the nonextensive scaling parameter , introduced in @xcite , @xmath19 is convenient to make the hamiltonian _ formally _ extensive @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the dimensionality of the system ) .",
    "the model is exactly the one introduced in @xcite , and the particular case @xmath22 recovers the celebrated lennard - jones model .",
    "the set of classical equations of motion were integrated using the velocity verlet algorithm , which preserves volume in phase space @xcite ; with an integration time step between @xmath23 and @xmath24 which guaranteed a conservation of the energy not worse than @xmath25 .",
    "initial conditions were constructed from the ground states of @xmath0 systems in @xmath26 and rescaling velocities with a maxwellian distribution of velocities to the desired value of energy .",
    "all calculations were performed once the transient behavior was over .      to properly understand the inclusion of the @xmath27 normalization term let s remember the cluster expansion in real gases . by integrating in moments we end up with the proportionality of the partition function and the configuration integral @xmath28}\\ ] ] in the van der waals approximation @xmath29 & \\sim & 1-\\beta v(r)\\quad r > r_{0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath30    with @xmath31 .",
    "we see that @xmath27 is a generalization of this term taking into account the adimensionalization and the finite number of particles . as the",
    "configurational integral is ill - defined for long - range potentials ( decaying slower than @xmath21 ) thermodynamic quantities @xmath32 like the internal energy , the free energy , gibbs energy , etc . associated with systems including long - range potentials scale like @xcite @xmath33    by normalizing the potential energy with @xmath27 the hamiltonian",
    "is turned formally extensive .",
    "the main observable to be extracted from our simulations is the caloric curve ( @xmath34 ) , which is defined as the functional relationship between the temperature of the system and its energy in terms of the density i.e. @xmath35 , from which we define the specific heat as    @xmath36    it is then clear that a @xmath37 will be obtained if and only if the @xmath34 displays a loop .",
    "it has recently been proposed that first order phase transitions would be univocally signed by the amount of fluctuations in the different subsystems in which the system can be subdivided @xcite . in particular , the relative kinetic energy fluctuation @xmath38 is defined as :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the number of particles , @xmath41 the standard deviation of the kinetic energy per particle and @xmath42 the temperature of the system . since kinetic energy fluctuations and the specific heat are related by @xcite    @xmath43    negative values of the specific heat should be expected whenever @xmath44 exceeds the canonical value ( @xmath45 for @xmath5 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) @xcite .",
    "we will first focalize in the study of three - dimensional systems . in fig.[cca ] we show the caloric curve for a system composed of @xmath1 particles with @xmath48 ( upper left panel ) and for @xmath49 , a long - range potential ( upper right panel ) . for future reference , it is interesting to notice that the case @xmath48 for 3 dimensions would correspond to @xmath22 in 2 dimension because for both the quotient @xmath50 it can be seen that a loop in the caloric curve is present in both cases only when the system density is low ( notice the density differences in both panels ) . for a short - ranged potential the relationship between the caloric curves and the constraining volume has already been clarified ( see @xcite ) : the presence of a loop in the caloric curve can be related to the formation of drops in configuration space . when dealing with long - ranged potentials the scenario slightly changes , even though the clusters can not be completely isolated , we still have weakly - interacting clusters , they just need more room to accommodate",
    ". we will come back to this point later .    in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ cca ] we show @xmath38 for several densities ( see caption for details ) .",
    "whereas the symbols refer to calculations of @xmath44 via fluctuations ( eq.[eqa ] ) the lines show the corresponding @xmath44 estimations using the information provided by the caloric curves , through eq.[eqfluc ] .",
    "it is immediate that fluctuations are enhanced well above the canonical value for the cases where the caloric curve displays a loop .    in fig.[cc3d ]",
    "we show the dependence of the caloric curve with the range of the interaction for a constant density ( @xmath51 , which correspond to a low density for all but the extremely long - range potential @xmath52 , reflected by the absence of a loop in the caloric corresponding curve . also notice that the energy which points the entrance of the system into the vapor branch is an increasing function of the total energy for long - range systems ( @xmath53 ) and then collapses to a constant value for the short - range cases studied .",
    "the importance of the loop in the caloric curve resides in the fact that it is a signal which identifies the presence of a first order phase transition for the corresponding density and lower ones . in ref",
    "@xcite the phase diagram for a pure @xmath0 system was constructed by analyzing different observables . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the phase diagram was divided into three density regions . in the low density regime",
    "the @xmath34 displays a loop whereas for higher densities the identification of the transition line was performed by a phase - space analysis .",
    "it is therefore relevant to study the relationship between the range of the potential and the density for which the loop disappears which we have called disjoint density @xmath54 since it acts like a separatrix between two regions of the phase diagram .",
    "up to this point we have identified the presence of negative specific heats via two independent signals : the presence of the loop in the @xmath34 and abnormally large kinetic energy fluctuations @xmath38 .",
    "we define @xmath54 as the density at which the signals ( presence of the loop including errors and relative fluctuations greater than the canonical value ) either both disappear at the same time or they become inconsistent , i.e. a loop without big relative fluctuations or viceversa .",
    "it is worth to notice that only in a region in @xmath55-space very close to @xmath54 these two signals can become inconsistent .",
    "special care should be taken because not only we are dealing with observables linked to mean values but to fluctuations ( second moments ) , as well . in order to disregard erroneous results we performed a statistical inefficiency study , a tool which was introduced by jacucci and rahman @xcite to estimate errors from correlated data series .",
    "the block average procedure is used to calculate the error of a quantity @xmath56 computed from a correlated data series . in order to establish the error ,",
    "the data are grouped into @xmath57 blocks of length @xmath58 .",
    "we expect the averages of the data in each block no to be correlated for sufficiently long @xmath58 .",
    "the block size ( @xmath58 ) is used to obtain uncorrelated data ( the statistical inefficiency @xmath59 ) for a quantity @xmath56 using :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are given by :    @xmath63    @xmath64    @xmath65 is the average of every block and @xmath66 is the average over the full data set of length @xmath67 .",
    "having determined the value of statistical inefficiency , the simulation runs are divided into blocks of size @xmath68 , and sampled either via a random sampling , where a single value is taken at random from each block , the data set taken as the set of such values ; or coarse - graining , where the data set is taken as the set of block averages .    in fig.[inef ] we show the results of the statistical inefficiency analysis for @xmath69 .",
    "we can see that the caloric curve does not change appreciably , we can not state the existence of the loop due to the numerical uncertainties involved ( see panel @xmath70 ) . even though @xmath38 is more sensitive to numerical correlations between the data ( it depends on both the first and second moments ) this signal does not change qualitatively between the raw data and the random sampling .",
    "it is interesting to notice the behavior of the statistical inefficiency as a function of the system energy : there is a clear peak in the same region where the caloric curve displays a loop , showing that the transition from liquid - like to a gas - like system is in correspondence with an increase in the correlation time .    using results obtained with the above - mentioned methodology , we show in fig.[critical ] @xmath54 as a function of @xmath71 .",
    "we can see that there is a clear distinction between long - range and short - range systems : for long - range systems ( @xmath53 ) @xmath54 is an increasing function of @xmath71 ( a decreasing function of the potential range ) which suggest that the loop acts as a pointer of  surfaces  , since a long - range interaction system needs more volume to develop a structure with weakly interacting clusters . for short - range systems",
    "there is a collapse to a @xmath72 value .    summarizing the results of this section , we have found from our calculations that in the case of constrained small three - dimensional systems negative specific heats appear for all ranges of the interaction potential , i.e. for all values of the parameter @xmath71 for densities below an appropriate threshold for each case .",
    "we now turn our attention to systems in two dimensions . in the upper panel of fig.[kasigma ]",
    "we show the range dependence of the caloric curves for a constant value of the density @xmath73 for @xmath74 particles .",
    "it is immediate that there are differences between the three - dimensional and the two - dimensional case . in the former we found that if the density is low enough , then a loop in the caloric curve is present for every @xmath71 ( @xmath54 being an increasing function of @xmath13 ) . on the other hand , for the two - dimensional case we found a loop for a long - range potential ( @xmath75 ) , and also for a short - range case ( @xmath76 , that correspond to a short - range potential in @xmath47 ) .",
    "however the increase of @xmath71 towards bigger values makes the depth of the loop almost vanish , which forbids us to identify negative values of @xmath77 due to the numerical uncertainties involved .",
    "moreover , if we only take into account the range of the potential @xmath78 ( as was defined in @xcite ) and we compare what happens for @xmath79-dimensional and @xmath80-dimensional systems , we realize that we have two different behaviors for the same value of the potential range .",
    "recall from fig.[cc3d ] that the curve corresponding to @xmath48 , @xmath5 exhibit a clear loop ; on the other hand from fig.[kasigma ] the case @xmath81 , @xmath47 presents no loop .",
    "this show that the existence of the loop is not only related to the range of the potential , but to the dimension of the system as well .    in brief ,",
    "at variance with the three - dimensional case , in two dimensions the system does not display negative specific heats for all ranges of the interaction potential but only for @xmath53 , partially confirming the results of @xcite .",
    "we now turn our attention to the analysis of the behavior of the quantity @xmath82 for the two - dimensional case . in the middle and lower panels of fig.[kasigma ]",
    "we show the relative fluctuations of the kinetic energy @xmath38 and the standard deviation of the kinetic energy per particle as a function of the energy for @xmath83 .",
    "we see once again that @xmath84 is a good signature of the presence of the loop . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath85 is essentially the same for all curves shown ( having and not having a loop ) . in the @xmath86 @xmath0 case , it has been found @xcite that this signal changes from displaying a loop to a monotonous increasing function of the energy at the critical density @xmath87 .",
    "this picture is compatible with the left panel of fig.[kasigma_2d ] , where we show the density dependence of the caloric curves , @xmath38 , and the standard deviation of the kinetic energy per particle for a short - range ( @xmath22 , left panel ) and a long - range ( @xmath75 , right panel ) case .",
    "it is worth to mention that it is only for the @xmath22 system that we can make a correspondence with the phase diagram of a @xmath0 fluid .",
    "nevertheless the right panel of fig.[kasigma_2d ] show us that the scenario does not change qualitatively for long - range potentials between @xmath47 and @xmath5 .",
    "in this work we have undertaken a detailed numerical analysis of the thermodynamic behavior of finite confined systems in two an three dimensions at fixed @xmath88 . our goal was to study the behavior of the specific heat in terms of the density and dimension of the system .",
    "we identified negative specific heats by searching for loops in the corresponding caloric curves , and studying the relative kinetic energy fluctuations of the system , finding consistent results in both approaches .",
    "special emphasis was taken in the statistical treatment of data due to correlations present in the time series . as a consequence of the above mentioned analysis",
    "we have found that the presence of negative specific heat is a quite general feature present in confined systems in two an three dimensions interacting with long - ranged and short - ranged interaction potentials . using a lj generalized potential in which the range is given when",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath71 is fixed we have found that for three - dimensional systems there is always a value of the density for which the system displays a negative @xmath77 . on the other hand , when the system is two - dimensional , there is a @xmath89 such that above it the size of the fluctuations does not allow us to identify the presence of negative values of @xmath77 ."
