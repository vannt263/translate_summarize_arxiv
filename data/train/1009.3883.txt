    "the main goal of this note is to introduce a new and more general fractional sum operator that unify and extend the discrete fractional operators used in fractional calculus .",
    "looking to the literature of discrete fractional difference operators , two approaches are found ( see , , @xcite ) : one using the @xmath0 point of view ( sometimes called the forward fractional difference approach ) , another using the @xmath1 perspective ( sometimes called the backward fractional difference approach ) . here we introduce a new operator , making use of the symbol @xmath2 ( definition  [ diamond ] ) . when @xmath3 the @xmath2 operator is reduced to the @xmath0 one ; when @xmath4 the @xmath2 operator coincides with the corresponding @xmath1 fractional sum .",
