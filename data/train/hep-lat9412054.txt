    "recently milc group has extensively investigated the finite temperature transition / crossover in the case of two degenerate wilson fermions and found unexpected phenomena@xcite . for @xmath7=4 , when the quark mass is heavy the transition is smooth and when the quark mass is light it is also smooth . however , in the intermediate mass region(@xmath8 ) , the transition is very sharp .",
    "this is completely opposite to what was supposed to be realized : it was supposed to become weaker or disappear .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath9 , in the range of intermediate mass , they observed clear two state signals .",
    "we reproduce in fig.[fig]-a the data@xcite for the pion screening mass squared @xmath10 , the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath11 and the quark screening mass @xmath12 at @xmath4 , together with our data@xcite .",
    "the transition of the polyakov loop is sharp and a cusp appears in the pion screening mass at the transition point .",
    "the quark mass defined through an axial - vector ward identity@xcite also exhibits peculiar behavior .",
    "the @xmath12 in the high temperature phase on the @xmath13 lattice behaves singularly and does not agree with that in the low temperature phase .",
    "this is in clear contrast with the fact that the @xmath12 is almost independent of whether the system is in the high temperature phase or in the low temperature phase at @xmath14 in the quenched qcd @xcite and at @xmath15 for @xmath16 case@xcite .",
    "one possible reason for these phenomena is that we are far from the continuum limit . in this work ,",
    "we study the finite temperature transition / crossover in the case of two degenerate quarks using a renormalization group ( rg ) improved action where we are supposed to be close to the continuum limit .",
    "our main concern is to see whether the unexpected phenomena described above persist with the improved action .",
    "the rg improved action for pure gauge theory we proposed about ten years ago is @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "each oriented loop appears once in the sum .",
    "the form of the gauge action is determined by a block - spin rg analysis in the pure gauge theory@xcite .",
    "we calculated the string tension@xcite and the hadron spectrum@xcite and investigated the topological properties and the @xmath20 problem@xcite in the quenched qcd with this improved action .",
    "we observe the following among others : the approach to the perturbative result for the expectation value of the plaquette is much faster than the case of the standard one - plaquette action@xcite .",
    "also note that the scale parameter of the improved action @xmath21 is close to the @xmath22 : @xmath23 0.488@xcite .",
    "therefore the bare coupling of the improved action is already an improved coupling@xcite .    with these results it may be worthwhile to use a rg improved action for full qcd .",
    "the action we use as an improved action for full qcd is given by @xmath24 the action is a sum of the rg improved action for gluons and the wilson action for quarks .",
    "this action reduces to the improved pure gauge action in the heavy quark mass limit .",
    "there is also a possibility to improve the quark action .",
    "however we take the wilson action for the quark action as a first step , because we believe that the effect of the improvement of the gauge sector is much more significant than that of the quark sector by the following reasoning : after integration over fermion variables , the quark action may be written as a sum over various types of wilson loops , assuming the convergence of hopping parameter expansion .",
    "the coefficients of various types of wilson loops thus obtained are much smaller compared with @xmath18 for the improved pure gauge action .",
    "numerical simulations are done at @xmath25 2.0 and 2.1 on an @xmath2 lattice at several hopping parameters . in order to fix the scale and to compare the results in the high temperature phase with those in the low temperature phase",
    ", we also make simulations on an @xmath26 lattice .",
    "we use the hybrid monte carlo algorithm to generate gauge configurations with molecular dynamics step size @xmath27 = 0.01 .",
    "momentum refresh is done at every one unit of simulation time .",
    "acceptance rates are larger than 0.92 for all cases .",
    "we discard first 100 @xmath28 400 trajectories for thermalization and use 100 @xmath28 1000 trajectories for measurement .",
    "the numbers of trajectories for thermalization and measurement are chosen taking into account whether the simulation point is close or not to the transition point .",
    "wilson loops and polyakov loops are measured at every trajectory .",
    "screening correlation functions are measured at every 5 trajectories on an @xmath29 lattice obtained by doubling the original lattice .    using the @xmath30 meson mass calculated on the @xmath31 lattice as an input ,",
    "we obtain @xmath32 1.01 gev and 1.18 gev at @xmath25 2.0 and 2.1 , respectively .",
    "therefore these @xmath33 s correspond approximately to @xmath34 5.0 and 5.1 of the standard action , respectively .",
    "fig.[fig]-b shows the results for the observables at @xmath34 2.0 versus @xmath35 , where the @xmath36 is determined from the quark mass on the @xmath13 lattice .",
    "the data indicate the following : 1 ) the transition / crossover of the polyakov loop around @xmath37 is very smooth .",
    "2 ) the hopping parameter dependence of the quark mass is also smooth and its value on the @xmath38 lattice agrees well with that on the @xmath39 lattice .",
    "this implies that the value of the quark mass is almost independent of whether the system is in the low temperature phase or in the high temperature phase .",
    "3 ) the pion screening mass does not exhibit a cusp .",
    "these features of the transition / crossover at @xmath0 are totally different from those observed for the standard action at @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath5 are about 1 gev for both cases .",
    "we also observe a similar very clear contrast between the results at @xmath41 with the improved action and those at @xmath42 with the standard action where @xmath5 are both approximately 1.2 gev .",
    "furthermore preliminary results in the range of of @xmath43 indicate that the transitions are smooth from @xmath44 down to at least @xmath45 .",
    "therefore we conclude that the sharp transition in the intermediate mass region disappears with the improved action at @xmath13 .",
    "this suggests a strong possibility that the first order phase transition observed by milc at @xmath9 disappears with this action . to confirm this",
    ", we are planning to extend the work to a wider range of parameter , in particular , on a lattice with @xmath9 .",
    "the simulations are performed with fujitsu vpp500/30 at university of tsukuba .",
    "we would like to thank c.  detar for providing us with data by milc collaboration .",
