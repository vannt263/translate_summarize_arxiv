    "some inflationary models require the trans - planckian field value for inflaton to realize the sufficient e - foldings . in this case , the planck - suppressed operators become dominant and spoil the flatness of the inflaton potential .",
    "thus , we consider its modification to realize the results from planck by introducing inflaton with the sub - planckian field value .",

    "in this model , the universe could be reheated up through inflaton decay after the end of inflation .",
    "since @xmath56 is assumed to be satisfied here , the reheating temperature realized through this process could be estimated as @xmath57 in this estimation , we take account of the constraint from the neutrino mass generation as discussed in the previous part . here",
    "we also note that @xmath58 should be larger than @xmath59 , which is imposed by the present bound of dm direct search since we suppose that the lightest neutral component of @xmath4 is dm and its mass is @xmath60  tev @xcite .",

    "we have considered an extension of the radiative seesaw model with a complex singlet scalar to realize the inflation of the universe keeping favorable features of the original model , that is , the simultaneous explanation of the small neutrino masses , the dm abundance and the baryon number asymmetry in the universe .",
    "this singlet scalar plays a crucial role not only for inflation but also for the small neutrino mass generation . in this scenario ,",
    "the inflaton trajectory follows an aperiodic circle during the inflation .",
    "this feature makes it possible that sub - planckian values of the relevant field induce trans - planckian change of the inflaton value which is needed for the sufficient e - foldings .",
    "the model could be free from the serious problem caused by trans - planckian field values . both the spectral index @xmath43 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath44 could have values which are favorable from the recent cmb observations .",
