    "a number of proton dripline nuclei are of particular interest as waiting points in the rapid - proton capture ( rp ) process expected to be active in the accretion of a close binary system containing a neutron star and resulting in an x - ray burst @xcite .",
    "when the proton binding energy becomes negative at the dripline another proton is needed to produce the borromean system ( a bound system with unbound subsystems ) .",
    "the effective lifetime of the critical waiting points in a stellar environment is a central quantity in the understanding of this astrophysical process .",
    "this depends crucially on both proton binding of the waiting point plus one and two protons , as well as the reaction rate forming these nuclei @xcite .",
    "the current estimates still result in an uncertainty in the effective lifetime of several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the energy , capture time and capture mechanism can be explored through three - body calculations .",
    "relatively few full three - body results have been published , although many capture rates have been estimated using various approximations @xcite .",
    "so far the three - body results have been limited to nuclei lighter than @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , three heavier critical waiting points exists , which have as of yet not been treated from a few - body perspective .",
    "these critical waiting points are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "recent efforts suggest @xmath6 is of less importance than previously thought , while @xmath7 , on the other hand , is thought to be of prime importance @xcite .",
    "weakly bound nuclear states have been successfully described as few - body structures in a number of cases for a long time @xcite .",
    "the most thorough and abundant theoretical investigations exist along the neutron dripline @xcite , but also excited states of ordinary nuclei have revealed this structure @xcite , and recently a few medium - heavy alpha - dripline nuclei were suggested to be of two - alpha + core structure @xcite .",
    "few - body formalism is most often applied to the very light nuclei , where the constituent particles have a less intricate structure .",
    "for instance , few - body models have been applied successfully in describing the bridging of the mass gaps at @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "likewise , three - body models have been applied for two - neutron plus core systems to provide astrophysically relevant production rates at the neutron dripline @xcite again for the very light systems .",
    "the next step to the proton dripline nuclei and two - proton structure has been investigated for special , relatively light nuclei @xcite , but much less for heavier systems . for the heavier nuclei",
    "the increased coulomb interaction severely complicates at least the numerical calculations , if not the conceptual picture .",
    "the location of the proton dripline - which is rather irregular - is fairly well established at least up to around the medium - heavy nuclei @xcite , but details of the nuclear properties are often very scarce .",
    "the most important quantity is of course the binding energy and the related stability which provides the definition of the dripline . near the neutron dripline",
    "it is established that low - angular momentum single - particle states produce spatially extended two - neutron halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "this few - body picture is less effective at the proton dripline since the unavoidable coulomb interaction would produce a confining barrier for bound nuclei .",
    "however , a cluster structure of decoupled core and proton degrees of freedom still constitutes a fair description provided the core is relatively tightly bound , and the few - body binding energy is very small or perhaps even negative .",
    "performing two and three - body calculations at the proton dripline requires information about the single - proton orbits , in particular their energy , as well as spin and parity relative to the core nucleus .",
    "measured values are in most cases not available for these ground and low - lying excited states , which should be occupied by the protons just before or after reaching the dripline .",
    "instead , trends from neighbouring nuclei and especially the results from mean - field calculations are used .",
    "the inherent uncertainties can be ascertained by variation of these input parameters .",
    "the purpose of this paper is first of all to provide characterizing information about the rp process at waiting points for intermediate heavy nuclei along the proton dripline .",
    "the intend is to provide an initial method for approaching nuclei around the critical waiting points from a three - body perspective .",
    "the borromean three - body structure is crucial as an intermediate structure which therefore first must be investigated .",
    "we shall determine structure and constraints for the decisive two - body proton - core energies .",
    "this is used to present a general method for estimating proton capture rates given very sparse experimental information .    in sec .",
    "[ sec theo ] we briefly give the theoretical framework and pertinent formulae for both the few - body formalism and the three - body reaction rates , as well as the parametric choices of the potentials .",
    "section [ sec 3b grnd ] contains a detailed description of the ground state properties of the borromean proton dripline systems of interest . both the relation between two- and three - body energies and the structure of the ground state is examined in detail .",
    "section [ sec pro ] gives calculated results for the radiative capture reaction rates , based on the most likely two - body energies .",
    "this also includes a necessary examination of the most likely excited states .",
    "section [ sec impli ] discusses limiting values of the basic physical parameters , and predict borromean structure and the related reaction mechanism at the astrophysical waiting points .",
    "this is combined to provide a method for estimating proton capture rates around the critical waiting points .",
    "finally , we briefly summarize and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec con ] .",
    "our aim is to calculate proton dripline three - body structures and capture rates from continuum two - proton states into the corresponding borromean ground state at medium heavy waiting points . for this",
    "we need properties of ground and continuum states as well as the derived rates and cross sections .",
    "the general theoretical background can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , but for completeness we shall here collect the ingredients necessary to explain notation , calculations and results . we shall only discuss two - proton three - body systems .",
    "we outline briefly our method of hyperspheric adiabatic expansion of the faddeev equations in coordinate space @xcite .",
    "the system of two protons and a core can be described by three sets of the relative jacobi coordinates , @xmath11 , defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a normalization mass chosen to be the nucleon mass of @xmath14  mev@xmath15 .",
    "the six hyperspherical relative coordinates are the two pairs of directional angles , @xmath16 , for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and hyperangle , @xmath19 , and hyperradial , @xmath20 , coordinates defined by @xmath21    the hamiltonian , @xmath22 , can be written both in jacobi and hyperspheric relative coordinates . for later convenience",
    "we focus here on the jacobi set where @xmath23 connects core and proton , that is we can define @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the reduced masses of core - proton and proton to core - proton systems , respectively .",
    "the three two - body interactions are the proton - proton interaction , @xmath27 , the core - proton interaction , @xmath28 , and the interaction between the core and the second proton , @xmath29 .",
    "the coordinate dependencies of the two - body interactions , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , between protons and core are given as arguments .",
    "in hyperspheric coordinates we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the angular momentum operators related to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the method consists of an adiabatic expansion of the total wave function @xmath36 , that is @xmath37 where each of the angular wave functions , @xmath38 , is a sum of faddeev components , @xmath39 , related to the three corresponding jacobi sets , and obeying the faddeev equations @xmath40 the angular eigenvalues , @xmath41 , and the related complete set of eigenfunctions , @xmath42 , are first computed for each @xmath20 .",
    "subsequently the radial expansion coefficients , @xmath43 , are found from the coupled set of radial equations @xmath44 the left hand side reveals the crucial effective adiabatic part of the diagonal potential acting on the particles @xmath45      the result of the three - body calculations is dictated by the two - body potentials employed .",
    "the proton - proton interaction in free space is well known in many details and with high accuracy . however , its influence on the three - body solutions is only marginal provided , first of all , that the @xmath46-wave scattering length is reproduced , and second that the low - energy properties of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 partial waves are of reasonable ( small ) size and in fair agreement with the experimental values .",
    "the phenomenologically adjusted potentials described in ref .",
    "@xcite were used for the proton - proton interaction .",
    "the test case used throughout this paper is the three - body system @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "however , the results apply to the region in general , as the small mass and charge variations between the three critical waiting points are inconsequential for our purposes .",
    "the proton - core potential is on the other hand decisive and a careful choice has to be made . for light - to - medium heavy cores of mass numbers around @xmath51 we use the woods - saxon form with a spin - orbit interaction , that is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the distance between the two bodies",
    ", @xmath54 is the coulomb potential , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the potential strengths of the nuclear and spin - orbit potential , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the angular momentum and spin operators , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are parameters governing the radius and the thickness of the potentials .",
    "this form is used for all partial waves , although the two strength parameters vary strongly depending mainly on the angular momentum .",
    "a three - body potential will generally not be included .",
    "this would eventually be needed to adjust the energy levels according to a measured two- and three - body energy spectrum .",
    "however , the effect of such an addition is considered throughout the paper .    for the mass region in question",
    "we choose the values of the radial shape parameter to be @xmath61  fm , @xmath62  fm , @xmath63  fm , and @xmath64  fm .",
    "these choices are motivated by the knowledge of the average nuclear mean - field potentials and densities @xcite .",
    "accurate values are not needed because adjustments of the strengths in any case are necessary for fine - tuning of the two - body energies .",
    "this is also one reason for omitting more complicated spin - dependence like the tensor or quadratic spin - orbit potentials .",
    "in addition , the coulomb potential is chosen from homogeneous charge distributions of radii , @xmath65  fm , and @xmath66  fm for core - proton system and proton - proton systems , respectively .",
    "the two - body strength parameters are usually adjusted to reproduce the core - proton bound and resonance energies , but unfortunately the energy spectrum of @xmath67br is not known experimentally .",
    "based on shell model calculations the region is known to be near the midpoint of the @xmath68-shell .",
    "the most likely two - body orbitals are then @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( or possibly @xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 .",
    "however , recent experiment show that the @xmath72 orbital is not important for nuclei around @xmath73 with @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "instead @xmath75 and @xmath47 orbitals are assumed to dominate the low - lying spectrum .",
    "this is also confirmed by the known spectrum of the mirror nuclei @xcite . to get opposite parity single - particle orbitals , necessary to form negative parity three - body states , a @xmath76 orbital",
    "can be included instead . to allow occupancy only of these selected two - body core - proton states in the three - body calculation",
    "is tricky because both lower- and higher - lying levels must be excluded .",
    "the pauli forbidden two - body bound states are excluded for each partial wave by use of shallow potentials without bound states .",
    "the large - distance properties are then precisely correct but the unimportant nodes at small distances are then not present for these excited states .    to locate one and only one partial wave at a given small energy we must provide an accurately adjusted attractive potential , while all other partial waves must have sufficiently strongly repulsive potentials to prevent occupancy .",
    "a given two - body energy then provides one constraint correlating the two strengths . to select one and only one of two spin - orbit partners we choose a relatively high , positive or negative , value of @xmath56",
    "this may result in an abnormal order of spin - orbit partners , but the goal is achieved .",
    "the different partial waves are completely independent of each other on the two - body level , and we can therefore place all of them as we choose .",
    "we want to calculate the waiting time before two protons from the astrophysical environment are captured by a proton - dripline nuclear bound core .",
    "the reaction rate , @xmath59 , for the corresponding one - step @xmath77 , three - body transition process , @xmath78 , is given in general in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the special system of two protons plus an even - even core",
    "the rate becomes @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the photon energy , @xmath81 the total three - body energy , and @xmath82 is the three - body ( positive ) binding energy of the even - even nucleus , @xmath83 , with the wave function , @xmath84 .",
    "the photodissociation cross section , @xmath85 , for the inverse process @xmath86 , is a sum over contributing electric multipole transitions of different orders , @xmath87 .",
    "that is @xmath88 where the strength function for the @xmath89 transition , @xmath90 is given through the reduced matrix elements , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the electric multipole operator , @xmath93 is the wave function of energy , @xmath94 , for all bound and ( discretized ) three - body continuum states in the summation .",
    "the astrophysical processes most often occur in a gas of given temperature , @xmath95 , which means we have to average the rate in eq .  ( [ eq rate ] ) over the corresponding maxwell - boltzmann distribution , @xmath96 , @xmath97 where the temperature is in units of energy .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq rate ] ) , ( [ eq siggam ] ) , and ( [ eq tran ] ) with eq .  ( [ eq ave rate ] ) results in a full three - body calculation of the energy - averaged reaction rate , as the wave functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq tran ] ) are proper three - body wave functions .    in the special case , where the resonances are very narrow and well separated",
    "the expression can be simplified greatly .",
    "if @xmath93 is a bound state , or a very narrow resonance state described accurately as a bound state , we can assign a photon emission width , @xmath98 , to the transition from this state , that is given by @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the angular momentum of the three - body resonance with energy @xmath101 .    if furthermore the three - body resonance is approximated by a breit - wigner shape , the photodissociation cross section in eq .",
    "( [ eq siggam ] ) can be written as @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the strong decay width , and the total ( in principle energy dependent ) width @xmath105 .    with the dominating contributions arising from",
    "well separated , narrow resonances of breit - wigner shapes as in eq .",
    "( [ eq gamgam ] ) , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq ave rate ] ) can be solved analytically , and we arrive at a very simple expression for the average rate @xmath106 the only assumption in this expression is that the photodissociation cross section is accurately expressed by the breit - wigner form in eq .",
    "( [ eq gamgam ] ) with three - body resonance energy , @xmath107 and width @xmath108 .",
    "other contributing narrow well - separated resonances can simply be added .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq rate esti ] ) is valid for one or more contributing narrow resonance irrespective of capture mechanism .",
    "the three - body ( two proton plus an even - even core ) calculation leads to a @xmath109 ground state independent of the number and character of the contributing core - proton single - particle states .",
    "the lowest excited three - body bound or resonance state would almost definitely be a @xmath110 state .",
    "this is confirmed by the mirror nuclei @xcite , where the two lowest excited states are @xmath110 states .",
    "furthermore , the lowest possibly negative parity state is @xmath111 mev above the ground state , and there is no @xmath112 at all in the known spectrum .",
    "the dominating transition can therefore be assumed to be an @xmath113 transition . to examine the remote possibility of a @xmath112 state",
    "two opposite parity single - particle state must be allowed .",
    "the relative energies of the @xmath110 and @xmath112 states depend on the attractions of the two - body potentials for the corresponding partial waves .",
    "the energies of these excited states are , through eq .",
    "( [ eq rate esti ] ) , all - decisive for the capture rates . beside the three - body resonance energy also",
    "the effective width , @xmath114 , is important for the capture rate .",
    "the realistic assumption that @xmath115 allows an estimate of the relative sizes of the @xmath110 to @xmath112 effective widths , that is from ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath116 where @xmath59 is the radius of the nucleus .",
    "for @xmath117 we get with @xmath118  mev and @xmath119  fm that @xmath120 .",
    "this estimate is from a single - particle model , but within the three - body model effects from the other proton can at most contribute by a factor of two .",
    "the implication is that @xmath121 would dominate unless forbidden by rather strict conservation laws .",
    "the nuclear properties of the waiting points are related to the borromean structure reached after two - proton capture .",
    "we therefore first investigate the borromean ground state depending on the two - body potentials varying along the proton dripline . in the following subsections",
    "we discuss three - body energies and structure of the corresponding wave functions .",
    "the most tightly bound borromean nucleus is most likely a closed ( sub)shell for the core while the additional two protons occupy empty valence orbits .",
    "an extra stability is present for @xmath122 nuclei which conveniently also includes waiting point nuclei for @xmath123 .",
    "the ground states for both core and borromean nuclei have zero angular momentum and positive parity as always for even - even nuclei .",
    "the first excited states of these nuclei are @xmath124  mev @xcite , @xmath124  mev @xcite and @xmath125  mev @xcite , respectively .",
    "these rather high values demonstrate the stability required for a borromean three - body structure build on these inert cores .",
    "given the significant coulomb barrier the three - body system does in principle not need to be strictly bound .",
    "the only requirement is that the proton - decay branch is small compared to the @xmath126-decay branch .",
    "small positive three - body energies are then possible , which in principle extends our energy region of interest .",
    "however , the @xmath126 decay half - life of @xmath127kr has been measured to be 57(21 ) ms @xcite , so the possible extension is exceedingly small .",
    "s for @xmath70 ( dashed red line ) and @xmath69 ( dotted blue line ) in isolation , along with the combination of both @xmath70 and @xmath69 ( solid black line ) .",
    "all two - body potentials have been adjusted to produce the energy @xmath128 mev .",
    "it is seen how the spectrum of the combined case always follows the lowest available potential .",
    "[ fig pot comp ] ]    the two - body bound or resonance energies for the different partial waves are now the only pieces of information missing before the three - body properties can be calculated .",
    "we choose to use @xmath70 and @xmath69 and allow them both simultaneously with the same energy as well as one at a time .",
    "all other partial waves are either not present or shifted to high energies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig pot comp ] we show the lowest effective adiabatic potentials defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq eff pot ] ) for the three cases with the same two - body energy , @xmath129 mev , in all cases .",
    "we first notice an attractive potential for each contributing partial wave .",
    "when both @xmath70 and @xmath69 are allowed we find two attractive low - lying adiabatic potentials .",
    "both contributions are present in the combined case where the deepest potential always follow the lowest potential from either @xmath70 or @xmath69 for different @xmath20-values .",
    "constructive ( or destructive ) interference can only marginally occur through non - adiabatic terms since @xmath47 and @xmath75-waves can not couple to form a @xmath109 state .",
    "however , this results in avoided crossings for the combined case which therefore must produce lower three - body energies than the individual cases . in general ,",
    "the combined case can then never be less attractive than any of its components .    , @xmath70 , and @xmath69 in isolation , and for @xmath71 and @xmath69 as well as @xmath70 and @xmath69 in combination , the latter both with and without p - p interaction , and with and without a three - body potential .",
    "the linear fits are in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq e2e3 ] ) .",
    "all two - body potentials were adjusted to produce the same energy , when more that one wave is allowed .",
    "only a @xmath109 state is considered here .",
    "the horizontal and vertical line indicates our borromean region of interest .",
    "[ fig ener ] ]    the coupled set of adiabatic radial potentials is solved and energies and wave functions calculated .",
    "the two - body input parameters are not known although limits from the required borromean character can be found .",
    "we must therefore investigate the three - body properties as function of the unknown two - body energies .",
    "the three - body energies , @xmath130 , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig ener ] as functions of two - body energies , @xmath131 , for various selection of contributing partial waves .",
    "the most spectacular observation is that all curves are linear . in the figure we only exhibit results for the most interesting energy interval but",
    "the same observed linear dependence is accurately followed within the investigated interval , @xmath132  mev  @xmath133  mev .    when more than one partial wave is allowed , the two - body potentials are adjusted to produce the same energy . fixing the energy of one two - body partial wave , while increasing another one from the same value , the @xmath130 must increase and approach the higher - lying curve corresponding to the one contributing wave . if more than two degenerate core - proton single - particle levels contribute we would find even lower - lying @xmath130-curves . however , this is highly unlikely since this requires nuclear potentials of unprecedented high symmetry .",
    "omission of the proton - proton interaction in the case of two contributing partial waves , @xmath70 and @xmath69 , increase the curve even above @xmath134 , which apart from center - of - mass effects should correspond to three non - interacting systems .",
    "thus , we claim to have established limits for the @xmath130-variation between the lowest curve in fig .",
    "[ fig ener ] and a parallel curve roughly passing through @xmath134 .",
    "so far , the results shown in fig .  [ fig ener ] have been obtained using just the two - body interactions contained in eqs .",
    "( [ eq62 ] ) , ( [ eq64 ] ) , and ( [ eq66 ] ) . however , it is a well known fact that using only two - body potentials will usually lead to an underbound three - body structure , as shown for instance for @xmath135ne and @xmath136c in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this problem is typically overtaken by addition of an effective three - body force , @xmath137 , to the adiabatic potential given in eq .",
    "( [ eq eff pot ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , inclusion of such three - body force does not change the linear dependence shown in the figure .",
    "this is illustrated by the dashed ( yellow ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig ener ] , which corresponds to the dot - dashed ( black ) case , but where a modest gaussian three - body force @xmath138 has been included .",
    "in particular , the values @xmath139 mev and @xmath140 fm have been used . as seen in the figure ,",
    "inclusion of the three - body force only shifts the three - body energy , but keeps the energy relation intact .",
    "the simple linear dependency in fig .  [ fig ener ] is due to the special structure of the wave function and the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq62 ] ) .",
    "the core is much heavier than the proton , and the reduced masses are to a very good approximation both equal to the proton mass",
    ". then @xmath141 and the hamiltonians in eqs .  ( [ eq64 ] ) and ( [ eq66 ] )",
    "are also approximately equal , @xmath142 .",
    "if @xmath143 denotes the three - body wave function , the three - body energy is determined as the expectation value of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq62 ] ) , that is @xmath144 where the approximate equality arises due to the assumption @xmath145 .",
    "this approximation is consistent with @xmath143 as a product of corresponding two - body wave functions .",
    "for instance , when two single - particle states are allowed , for example @xmath70 and @xmath69 , we have @xmath146 , where the angular momentum coupling to @xmath109 of both terms implicitly is assumed .",
    "product terms of @xmath70 and @xmath69 are not allowed because the total angular momentum , @xmath109 , can not be reached .",
    "the above product structure of @xmath143 is rather general , since the @xmath23 distribution necessarily is described by the allowed single - particle wave functions whereas the same overwhelmingly dominating single - particle @xmath147-part for completeness should be extended to include other angular momentum components .",
    "we then get @xmath148 where the two - body energies are defined by @xmath149 and the cross terms vanish both due to orthogonality of the eigenfunctions of @xmath150 , and angular momentum conservation of the hamiltonian .",
    "we then arrive at the estimate of the three - body energy @xmath151 where @xmath152 .",
    "the occupation probabilities , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , are given by the relative weights of the partial waves .",
    "if only @xmath70 or @xmath69 are allowed we have @xmath155 and @xmath156 or @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and consequently the linear dependence seen in fig .",

    "for example , the lower limit , when allowing both @xmath70 and @xmath69 , is given by the black , dash - dotted line , and the upper limit is given by the curve corresponding to the wave with lowest energy .",

    "the off - resonance , background contribution is mainly relevant for lower temperatures , where the chance of accessing the resonance level is much smaller . for the much more unlikely @xmath112 case only one resonance state is present , which then dominates a wide temperature range around the resonance energy .    in the unlikely scenario where an @xmath112 state is available ,",
    "depending on its position , the @xmath121 transition could contribute significantly .",
    "however , based on both mean field calculations and experimental measurements in the region around the critical waiting points single - particle orbitals of like parity dominate the low - lying energy levels .",
    "also no @xmath112 state is seen in the mirror nuclei .",
    "this very effectively excludes three - body states of negative parity .",
    "the most likely transition is then the always allowed ( as long as more than s - waves are available ) @xmath113 transition .",
    "as the expression based on the assumed breit - wigner shape depends mainly on the resonance energies , the relations between two- and three - body energies can be used to provide limits for the reaction rate .",
    "alternatively , the rate estimates could also be based directly on three - body resonance energies if available .",
    "an added benefit of the three - body formalism is that no assumptions regarding the preferred reaction path are needed . on the contrary ,",
    "the most likely reaction mechanism can be deduced based on the structure of the angular wave functions corresponding to the lowest @xmath257 eigenvalues . for most of the relevant energies",
    "the mechanism can be considered sequential through narrow two - body resonances .",
    "this is intuitively understandable if the three - body excited resonance state has a higher energy than the resonance(s ) of the subsystem . on the other hand ,",
    "a very low temperature only allows direct decay ( or capture ) since then the available energy is too low to populate the two - body resonances even virtually .",
    "however , these reaction questions would eventually have to be answered by studying the dynamic evolution from small to the large distances in more detail .    in conclusion",
    "we have performed a full three - body analysis of the nuclear structure and decay of critical waiting points in the rp process .",
    "this allowed us to study in detail the two - proton capture rate needed to bridge the waiting points , as well as the energy levels central in determining the effective lifetimes of these waiting points in a stellar environment .",
    "we find that a simple expression , based on an assumed breit - wigner shape , can accurately reproduce the full three - body rate calculation in the temperature region @xmath338 gk generally considered to be of astrophysical interest .",
    "this led to a general method for estimating two - proton capture rates in the region around the critical waiting points based only on either the two- or three - body energies , if these are more readily available .",
    "specifically , we predict , given the currently available experimental data , that the two - proton capture rate forming @xmath50 for temperatures between 2 and 4 gk increase by a factor of 3.5 from @xmath339 .",
