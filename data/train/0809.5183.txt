    "the main part of a cryogenic detector , as e.g. used in the cresst @xcite experiment , is given by an absorber single crystal where incident particles ( e.g. @xmath0s , @xmath1s , neutrons or wimps @xcite ) interact by producing a recoil .",
    "this energy deposition gives rise to the formation of a phonon population .",
    "read - out of the phonon signal is realized with a so - called tes which is deposited onto the absorber crystal surface .",
    "the tes consists of a small ( @xmath2mm@xmath3 ) superconducting metal film , acting as thermometer , that is stabilized with the help of a heater in its super - to - normal conducting region where a strong temperature dependence of the resistance can be found .",
    "hence , the basic signal is a resistance change of the tes , that can be read out with a squid circuit @xcite .",
    "a link to the heat bath allows thermal relaxation of the system after an event .",
    "as for the direct dark matter search a large number of cryogenic detectors ( comprising , e.g. for eureca @xcite , a total mass on a ton scale ) with very similar properties and the possibility to employ different target materials is needed , the so - called composite detector design ( cdd ) was developed .",
    "it makes it possible to decouple the most critical part of the production process , the deposition of the tes onto the surface of the crystal , from the optimization procedure of the absorber single crystal itself @xcite .",
    "the tes is thus fabricated on a small crystal substrate ( tes - substrate ) which is then coupled to the large absorber crystal by gluing . in this way",
    ", the material of the absorber crystal can be chosen freely and does not suffer from the tes production process ( e.g. heating cycles ) .",
    "additionally , using the small crystal substrates allows for the production of several tess in one step and a simplified pretesting of the tess properties before attaching them to the large and expensive absorber crystals .",
    "the thermal detector model given in @xcite describes a classical cryogenic detector in terms of its thermal components , their heat capacitites c@xmath4 , and the thermal conductances g@xmath4 connecting these components ( see figure [ thermaldetectormodel]a ) . in this model the resulting pulse shape of the signal ( see figure [ thermaldetectormodel]b ) after an event can be calculated from and explained by these basic detector properties .    , t@xmath5 and t@xmath6 are the temperatures of the heat bath , the tes electron system and the absorber phonon system , respectively , c@xmath5 and c@xmath6 are their heat capacities .",
    "g@xmath7 , g@xmath8 and g@xmath9 are thermal conductances .",
    "b ) signal shape in a cryogenic detector with the tes directly deposited on the surface .",
    "the respective rise and decay times of the total signal and the thermal ( t ) and nonthermal ( nt ) signal components are indicated.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    an event in the absorber crystal immediately creates a nonthermal ( nt ) phonon population which is not in thermal equilibrium with the system . as can be seen in figures [ thermaldetectormodel]a and b , these nt phonons",
    "can then either relax via direct thermalisation in the tes , giving rise to a fast ( nt ) contribution ( red ) or thermalise in the absorber by inelastic scattering processes at the crystal surfaces leading to a temperature rise of the absorber and therefore delivering a slower , thermal ( t ) contribution ( blue ) to the signal .",
    "further details are given in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite .      in order to describe a composite detector and its response to an event , i.e. the resulting pulse shape , by a thermal detector model , the glue and the tes - substrate have to be included into the model and their influence on the evolution of the phonon - population and on the phonon propagation has to be investigated @xcite . in figure",
    "[ gluetdmphonons]a , a graphical representation describing a composite detector in terms of its thermal components and conductances is given , as well as the most important possibilities for phonon populations to evolve and to propagate ( see arrows , red for nt phonons , blue for t phonons ) .",
    "additionally , two different possibilities of including the glue into the model are shown .",
    "it can either be introduced as a thermal component of the system ( a ) , where nt phonons can enter and decay , building up an extra thermal phonon population that can independently contribute to the signal , or it can just be included into the model delivering a thermal conductance between the absorber and the tes - substrate ( b ) .",
    "a ) thermal model of a composite detector with two ways of including the glue ( _ a _ as thermal component or _",
    "b _ as thermal conductance ) and the most important phonon propagation possibilities .",
    "b ) remaining dominant signal contributions : the glue can be included as thermal conductance only . ]",
    "the basic concept used for the analysis of this model is to consider the upper part of a composite detector , the ( tes - substrate , tes)-system ( see figure [ gluetdmphonons]a ) as an individual cryogenic detector that can be described by the basic thermal detector model , referred to in section [ btdm ] .",
    "however , now the energy input into the system is no longer delivered by an event in its `` absorber '' , the tes - substrate , but is given by nt and t phonons , of the absorber or the glue , entering the tes - substrate via the glue - tes - substrate interface .",
    "thus the shape of the signal in the tes can be obtained by a convolution of the power input from the absorber or the glue with the response of the ( tes - substrate , tes)-system @xcite .",
    "for each of the phonon populations and propagations indicated in figure [ gluetdmphonons]a , the expected signal contribution ( pulse rise and decay times ) was calculated and then compared to the pulse shapes obtained experimentally for three different realized composite detectors ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the dominant signal contributions in a composite detector and the underlying mechanisms could be identified successfully ( see figure [ gluetdmphonons]b ) .",
    "the main conclusions have been , that the glue is basically transparent for nt phonons and that it has to be included into the model only as a thermal conductance . since no dominant contribution from nt phonons decaying in the glue",
    "could be detected , the glue can not be contributing a noticeable thermal component to the system .",
    "furthermore , only two different phonon populations were found to dominantly contribute to the signal in the tes : _ a ) _ nt phonons from the absorber can propagate through the glue into the tes - substrate where they can either be directly absorbed in the tes or decay into t phonons and then be absorbed in the tes and _ b ) _ t phonons from the absorber , that already decayed there can contribute to the signal via the thermal conductance delivered by the glue .",
    "however , depending on the exact detector design , i.e. , the _ tes - to - glue - area _",
    "ratio , not in every composite detector _ both _ of these two contributions are significant for the signal in the tes .",
    "( for further details see @xcite . ) a discussion concerning the implications on the composite detector design for dark matter experiments like cresst and eureca can be found in @xcite .",
