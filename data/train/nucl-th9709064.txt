    "the concepts and methods of effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite have recently elucidated the successful nuclear phenomenology of relativistic field theories of hadrons , called quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite .",
    "the eft framework shows how qhd models can be consistent with the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and can be extended to accurately reproduce its low - energy features .",
    "the eft perspective accounts for the success of relativistic mean - field models and provides an expansion scheme at the mean - field level and for going beyond it @xcite .",
    "one of the most compelling features of qhd mean - field phenomenology is the reproduction of spin - orbit splittings in finite nuclei after fitting only to the equilibrium properties of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "this successful result occurs when the velocity dependence of the equivalent central potential that leads to saturation arises primarily because of a reduced nucleon effective mass .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction in nuclei is then also specified by the structure of the four - component dirac spinors @xcite .",
    "does this connection survive in the extended eft framework ? here",
    "we re - examine the nature of the spin - orbit force in chiral effective field theories of nuclei .    the strong correlation in qhd models between the effective mass @xmath1 of the nucleon in equilibrium nuclear matter and",
    "the strength of the spin - orbit force in nuclei has been well documented @xcite .",
    "typical values of @xmath2 in successful models are roughly 0.6 , which yield spin - orbit splittings close to experimental values ( e.g. , 6mev for @xmath3 states in @xmath4o ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a wider class of models , which included variations of the linear sigma model as well as all of the standard qhd models used phenomenologically , was studied systematically .",
    "accurate reproductions of observables in finite nuclei , including the spin - orbit splitting in particular , tightly constrained the value of @xmath2 to the range @xmath5 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an effective hadronic lagrangian consistent with the symmetries of qcd and intended for application to finite density systems was constructed .",
    "this involved a different strategy than in conventional qhd phenomenology .",
    "rather than maximizing predictivity by minimizing the free parameters ( as in renormalizable models ) , the goal was to test a systematic expansion for low - energy observables , which included the effects of hadron compositeness and the constraints of chiral symmetry .",
    "the degrees of freedom are ( valence ) nucleons , pions , and the low - lying non - goldstone bosons . a scalar - isoscalar field with a mass of roughly 500mev was also included to simulate the exchange between nucleons of two correlated pions in this channel .",
    "the lagrangian was expanded in powers of the fields and their derivatives , with the terms organized using georgi s `` naive dimensional analysis '' ( nda ) @xcite .",
    "the coefficient of each term is written as a combination of the pion - decay constant @xmath6mev and a larger scale @xmath7gev times a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the effective lagrangian is said to be `` natural '' if these dimensionless coefficients are of order unity .",
    "the result is a faithful representation of low - energy , non - strange qcd , as long as all nonredundant terms consistent with symmetries are included .",
    "in addition , the mean - field framework provides a means of approximately including higher - order many - body and loop effects , since the scalar and vector meson fields play the role of auxiliary kohn ",
    "sham potentials in relativistic density functional theory @xcite",
    ". fits to nuclear properties at the mean - field level showed that the effective lagrangian could be truncated at the first few powers of the fields and their derivatives , with natural [ @xmath8 coefficients for each term .",
    "of the two full parameter sets identified , one ( model g2 ) provided an excellent fit , including spin - orbit splittings , with a nuclear matter value of @xmath9 .",
    "more recently , new parameters sets with excellent fits have been found with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "an analogous study was made of relativistic `` point - coupling '' ( pc ) models in ref .",

    "non - goldstone mesons are not included explicitly .",
    "one instead has an expansion of the nucleon scalar and vector potentials in powers and derivatives of local nucleon scalar and vector densities . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , an effective lagrangian consistent with chiral symmetry was constructed and fits to nuclear observables were made to test naturalness .",
    "excellent fits were found with unprecedented values of @xmath2 , as high as @xmath11 at nuclear matter equilibrium .",
    "our purpose here is to examine the nature of the nuclear spin - orbit force in these generalized models .",
    "we find that the most important new feature affecting spin - orbit splittings in the lagrangians of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite is the inclusion of a _",
    "tensor _ coupling of the omega field to the nucleon ( or its point - coupling analog ) .",
    "because the effective lagrangian includes a derivative expansion , the tensor term appears at a relatively low order .",
    "none of the other new terms has a comparable impact on the spin - orbit strength .",
    "we find a trade - off between the size of the scalar potential ( or equivalently , the effective mass @xmath12 ) and the size of the tensor coupling .",
    "the existence of such a trade - off has been noted in previous studies of the isoscalar tensor coupling in qhd models , but good fits to nuclei were found only with relatively small values of the coupling and thus small @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this coupling is usually taken to be zero in one - boson - exchange potentials @xcite or limited to small values due to constraints from _ free _ nucleon form factors and the assumption of vector meson dominance @xcite . however , as an effective coupling in nuclei , which might absorb higher - order many - body effects at the mean - field level , the isoscalar tensor coupling could be much larger than these constraints dictate and still be of natural size .    in fits made using more complete meson and point - coupling models , larger ( but still natural ) values",
    "are favored , particularly in the point - coupling models @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we show that the increase in @xmath2 in these models is well accounted for by the contribution from the tensor coupling .",
    "first , we consider two - component reductions of the models , which are reviewed in sects .  [",
    "sect : two ] and [ sect : three ] .",
    "the spin - orbit potential in the two - component single - particle hamiltonian manifests the influence of both @xmath2 and the tensor coupling , and a simple local - density approximation leads to quantitative predictions for the spin - orbit strength in nuclei .",
    "we find a strong correlation between the size of the isoscalar tensor coupling and the increase of @xmath14 above 0.6 .",
    "this discussion applies to a very general class of qhd models , including the quark - meson - coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite and the zimnyi - moszkowski ( zm ) model @xcite ( both of which are found to be deficient ) .",
    "a second approach is to transform the nucleon fields in models with tensor couplings .",
    "a feature of effective lagrangians is the freedom to perform field redefinitions without changing the physics ( if all nonredundant terms have been included ) .",
    "it is not possible to completely transform away the tensor interaction in a qhd effective lagrangian . to study the consequences for nucleon  nucleus scattering , however",
    ", we can perform an energy - dependent transformation to replace the potential in the dirac equation with an equivalent potential ( that is , one that generates the same scattering observables ) with no tensor term @xcite .",
    "the new scalar and vector potentials can then be compared to empirical optical potentials .",
    "it is well known that in relativistic models applied to hypernuclei , the isoscalar tensor coupling of the omega to the hyperon plays a critical role in _ reducing _ the strength of the hyperon spin - orbit potential @xcite .",
    "quark - model arguments imply that the anomalous coupling is equal to ( minus ) the vector coupling , which leads to a strong cancellation between contributions to the spin - orbit force and therefore small splittings , as needed phenomenologically . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no corresponding implication for the tensor coupling of the omega to nucleons .",
    "in this section , we explore the relationship between the spin - orbit force and the nucleon potentials in models without tensor potentials .",
    "the connection between the spin - orbit splittings and the scalar and vector potentials is most easily seen by making a reduction to a two - component spin - orbit hamiltonian .",
    "we can write the isoscalar part of the dirac single - particle hamiltonian ( for spherical nuclei ) as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nucleon mass , @xmath17 is the scalar potential , and @xmath18 is the vector potential . a tensor potential is considered in the next section .",
    "note that we need not assume that @xmath17 is simply proportional to a scalar meson field @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , @xmath17 could be proportional to @xmath19 ( as in conventional qhd models ) , or could be expressed as a sum of scalar and vector densities ( as in relativistic point - couplings models ) , or could be a nonlinear function of @xmath19 ( as in the qmc and zm models ) .    to leading - order in @xmath20 , the spin - orbit term in a foldy ",

    "successful models are natural @xcite , which implies that the potentials closely follow the baryon density .",
    "this result follows from the equations for the potentials and the close relationship between scalar and vector densities , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath26 .",
    "the precise expressions for the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 will depend on the model ; for example , in conventional qhd models @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in every case , however , naturalness implies that the corrections are order @xmath29 @xmath30 smaller than the leading term in the interior of nuclei and smaller still on the surface .",
    "furthermore , the scalar density and baryon density are equal to within 5 to 10% at ordinary nuclear densities .",
    "thus a simple local density approximation for @xmath31 and @xmath32 should be quite reasonable : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the values of the potentials in nuclear matter at equilibrium density @xmath36 .",

    "since @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the same in all successful models to very good approximation @xcite , the dependence on @xmath35 can be eliminated in favor of @xmath34 .",
    "4 .   therefore , the strength of the spin - orbit interaction ( [ eq : hfw ] ) and the resulting magnitude of the splitting in nuclei should be , to a good approximation , directly proportional to the size of @xmath34 , the scalar potential in nuclear matter .",
    "if this analysis is quantitatively valid , we would expect to find that plots of spin - orbit splittings in nuclei versus equilibrium @xmath2 for different models that reproduce nuclear density distributions would lie roughly on a straight line .",

    "the function @xmath135 goes to zero rapidly outside the nucleus , so scattering observables are unchanged .",
    "the new wavefunction @xmath19 satisfies @xmath136     \\phi_\\alpha({\\bf r } ) = e e^{2u\\gammazero } \\phi({\\bf r } ) \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : newphi}\\ ] ] by rewriting the exponents we can make the identifications : @xmath137 therefore the transformation introduces energy dependence into the effective scalar and vector potentials .",
    "if evaluated in nuclear matter for @xmath138 , the _ predicted _ values of @xmath139 and @xmath140 for the point - coupling models with @xmath141 are consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] ; in particular , one obtains @xmath142 for each model shown .",
    "the predicted values for the qhd models in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , however , are slightly smaller than expected [ @xmath117 is roughly 0.55 ] .    if we use @xmath102 and @xmath143 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mstara ] ) and ( [ eq : wa ] ) to evaluate the optical potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vopt ] ) , we find @xmath144 that is , the additional energy dependence in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mstara ] ) and ( [ eq : wa ] ) cancels out when evaluating @xmath126 .",
    "thus the energy dependence of the optical potential is simply proportional to the _ untransformed _ vector potential @xmath18 and is _ independent _ of @xmath92 ( or @xmath116 ) .",
    "if the tensor coupling is too large , figures  [ fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] imply that @xmath35 will be too small to account for the experimental energy dependence . therefore , smaller values of @xmath92 ( or @xmath116 ) are favored , with an upper limit around unity .",
    "this analysis is not conclusive , however , since the radial dependence of the potentials may invalidate the simple argument leading to the comparison with experiment @xcite .",
    "this issue will be considered in future work .",
    "we examined the role of an isoscalar tensor coupling to the nucleon in chiral effective lagrangians for nuclei .",
    "effective lagrangians must contain all nonredundant terms consistent with the underlying symmetries .",
    "since tensor couplings of the vector mesons to the nucleon ( or their analogs in point - coupling models ) will appear at low order in an expansion in powers of fields ( or densities ) and derivatives , they should be included .    in models that ignore such couplings",
    ", there is a strong correlation between the value of the nucleon effective mass @xmath1 at equilibrium nuclear matter density and spin - orbit splittings in nuclei .",
    "in fact , given a value of @xmath1 , one can predict the _ calculated _ splittings of weakly bound levels to an accuracy of roughly 0.3mev .",
    "moreover , to accurately reproduce the _ empirical _ splittings , one requires an equilibrium @xmath14 between 0.58 and 0.64 .",
    "interestingly , similar values of @xmath1 are obtained when fits are performed without including information from these splittings .",
    "when an isoscalar tensor coupling is included and allowed to vary freely , fits to nuclear properties slightly favor natural - sized values of the coupling , which are significantly larger than values deduced from free - space electromagnetic observables .",
    "this is particularly true in point - coupling models .",
    "these larger values of the coupling modify the simple relationship between @xmath1 and the spin - orbit splittings noted above ; however , it is possible to estimate the contribution of the tensor interaction to the spin - orbit force and to show that the larger values of @xmath1 obtained in nuclear matter are consistent with the observed splittings .",
    "we emphasize that the small size of the isoscalar tensor coupling deduced from free - space electromagnetic data is not incompatible with the larger values obtained in fits to nuclei , since the in - medium parameters must contain many - body effects . in all of the models discussed here ,",
    "the resulting tensor coupling is still natural .",
    "it remains to be seen whether explicit calculation of the many - body contributions can account for the larger values favored by nuclei .",
    "moreover , it may be possible to constrain the tensor coupling by including additional observables in the fits ; the energy dependence of the optical potential for nucleon - nucleus scattering is a promising candidate .",
