    "most of our understanding of close - in gas giant planets is enabled by studying those transiting in front of bright stars .",

    "the ratio of such hot jupiters numbers ( 60:2 ) is approximately the same as the corresponding ratio of survey areas on the sky ( 30,000:100 square degrees ) .    among parameters used to characterize hot jupiters ,",

    "sky - projected obliquities can be measured by observing exoplanets in spectroscopy during a transit : the planet occults a portion of its rotating host star and distorts the apparent stellar line profile ; this effect is known as the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite .",

    "doppler tomography , has also been used in a few cases and provides more precise parameters as well as a wider range of information on the planet and the host star ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    "the comparison of planets orbital periods and host stars rotation periods also constrains the dynamics of hot jupiters @xcite .",

    "this trend is supported by a dearth of _ kepler_objects of interest at short orbital periods around fast rotating stars @xcite ; such studies could be used to calibrate potential selection effects of ground - based transit surveys against detecting planets around fast rotating stars .    the xo project @xcite aims at detecting transiting exoplanets around bright stars from the ground with small telescopes .",
    "the project started in 2005 and discovered five close - in gas giant planets , xo-1b to xo-5b .",

    ", we conducted a follow - up campaign via photometry , radial velocity , and rossiter - mclaughlin observations including a doppler tomography analysis in order to establish the presence of the planet and extract the system parameters .",
    "the xo setup and observations are described in section [ sec : observations ] and the data reduction pipeline in section [ sec : data reduction ] .",

    "the new xo instrumental setup consists of three identical units installed at vermillion cliffs observatory , kanab , utah , at observatorio del teide , tenerife , canary islands , and at observatori astronmic del montsec ( oadm ) , near ger , spain .",
    "each unit is composed of two 10 cm diameter and 200 mm focal length canon telephoto lenses equipped with an apogee e6 @xmath12 pixels ccd camera mounted on a german - equatorial paramount me mount and protected by a shelter with a computer - controlled roof .",
    "all six lenses and cameras operate in a network configuration and point towards the same fields of view .",
    "these fields of view are different from those of the original xo , with no overlap .",
    "instrumental parameters and data reduction methods are similar as in @xcite unless indicated .",
    "the focus is adjusted to yield a psf ( point spread function ) fwhm ( full width half maximum ) of @xmath81 pixel ; in practice the fwhm varies between 1 and 1.5 pixels .",
    "the ccds are used in spatial - scan mode : pixels are read continuously while stars move along on the detector .",
    "the mount tracking and ccd reading rates are calculated to yield round psfs .",
    "the resulting images are long strips of @xmath13 instead of @xmath14 images that would result if the ccd was used in staring mode .",
    "this technique reduces overheads , increases the time spent at collecting photons , and maximizes the number of observed bright stars .",
    "the same two strips of the sky were observed over and over . between 50 and 100 strips",
    "were recorded each night by each camera ; the exposure time is 317 s for a full strip ( 53 s for each @xmath14 region ) . a weather sensor records meteorological data such as the ambient temperature , sky temperature , humidity , rain drops , wind speed and direction , dew point , etc ... every minute .",
    "each unit operates robotically : the weather data are interpreted in real time , a command is sent to open or close the roof , and run the observations .",
    "the units can also be controlled remotely .",
    "a rotating webcam sensitive in the visible and near - infrared is mounted inside each shelter and gives a live view of the systems .",
    "the observations span a duration of two times nine months between 2012 and 2014 , with gaps due only to weather and instrumental problems .",
    "first , data taken by the six camera systems are reduced independently .",
    "the strips are carved into @xmath12 pixel images , and we discard the first @xmath12 image of each strip where the scanning is just starting .",
    "this yields 9 fields of @xmath14 ; the field located around the celestial north pole is covered by both strips and has the maximum phase coverage .",
    "an approximate wcs ( world coordinate system ) solution is found for each image using the astrometry.net software program @xcite , and it is improved using a 6 parameter astrometric solution .",
    "dark frames are taken at the beginning and end of each night and are averaged to yield one dark per night .",
    "a flat - field is built from twilight flats and is used for the whole duration of the observations .",
    "science frames are calibrated by the dark and flat .",
    "warm columns are identified using high - pass filters ; columns with a excess of 15 adu with respect to their 10 neighbouring columns are flagged and their excess flux is removed .",
    "we find typically between 0 and 5 warm columns per image , except for one ccd which has up to 100 warm columns .",
    "we select the target stars from a reference image taken under very good conditions .",
    "this yields about 6000 stars in each field . to identify the target stars on each image , the coordinates of point sources are correlated to that of the target stars in the reference image .",
    "we perform circular aperture photometry using the stellar photometry software program @xcite .",
    "the sky background is calculated in an annulus around each star and is subtracted .",
    "the optimum photometric aperture radius is computed as a function of stellar magnitude for each camera using data taken under average conditions , and is kept constant for each star ; this radius varies from 2 to 10 pixels depending on the star magnitude .",
    "the photometric measurements are gathered in a star - epoch array where stars are sorted by ascending instrumental magnitude .",
    "one array is obtained for each field and each camera .",
    "the next reduction steps are performed only on the 2000 brightest stars of each field , which corresponds approximately to a limit magnitude v = 12 and a 1% rms photometric precision .",
    "several calibrations are applied independently for each scan direction ( the strips can be observed scanning north or south ) .",
    "the mean magnitude of each star is subtracted ; we use the magnitude residuals in all the following .",
    "we select the reference stars for each star and each scan direction separately . for a given star @xmath15",
    ", we subtract the photometric time series of @xmath15 from those of all the stars , and evaluate the mean absolute deviation ( mad ) of the resulting time series .",
    "stars are sorted by increasing mad ; the first index is excluded because it corresponds to star @xmath15 , and the following n stars are kept as reference stars .",
    "then , we build a reference time - series using an outlier resistant mean of the n reference stars , and subtract it to the time - series of star @xmath15 .",
    "this yields a calibrated lightcurve for star @xmath15 .",
    "we use n = 10 for all the stars .",
    "then , for each epoch , we remove a 3rd oder polynomial corresponding to low - frequency variations of magnitude residuals in the ccd s _ x , y _ plane , also called  l - flats \" .",
    "we also remove a linear dependance of each lightcurve with airmass .",
    "bad data are flagged according to several criteria : the quality of each epoch measured from the dispersion of the residuals of a subset of stars , the sky brightness and its homogeneity ( which account for clouds or a shelter s wall partially obscuring the field of view ) , the airmass , the number of detected stars , and the image cross - correlation ( revealing for example double point sources due to an imperfect tracking occurring occasionally on one of the mounts ) .",
    "then , systematic effects are removed using the sysrem algorithm @xcite .",
    "finally , the lightcurves from the 6 cameras are combined together and we search for periodic signals using the bls ( box least square ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "we keep signals compatible with planetary transits for visual inspection and detailed investigation .",

    "we conducted follow - up observations and analyses in photometry and spectroscopy to establish the nature of the system .",
    "the first spectroscopic measurements reveal that the star is a fast rotator , which jeopardizes measuring the mass of the companion by radial velocities ( see section [ sec : radial velocity follow - up ] ) .",
    "therefore , particular care is given in the photometric follow - up analysis to look for signs of a stellar eclipsing binary or a triple star system , as detailed in the following .",
    "although the xo lightcurve is contaminated by another star which is 1 magnitude fainter and located at 38  separation from xo-6 , both stars are well resolved by the follow - up instruments .",

    "this tidal push from the star might play a role in the apparent lack of transiting planets at short orbital periods around fast rotators . in this context , it is interesting to note that several hot jupiters lying in the @xmath43 domain stand out by their large eccentricities : hat - p-2b ( @xmath45 d , @xmath46 d , @xmath47 ) and hat - p-34b ( @xmath48 d , @xmath49 d , @xmath50 ) which eccentricities have been inferred from radial velocities , and corot-11b ( @xmath51 d , @xmath52 d , @xmath53 ) which eccentricity has been inferred from the timing offset of the secondary eclipse @xcite .",
