    "strong correlation and electron - phonon interaction are two important features of high tc ( htc ) superconductors .",
    "this situation motivates the study of electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction in strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "one important question is how stable the system is in the presence of the e - ph interaction .",
    "if the system has a robust stability , it is possible to use bcs - like theories , but if the system has a tendency to instability , polaronic and bipolaronic @xcite theories play an important role .",
    "many analitical @xcite and numerical @xcite works have been done to answer this question .",
    "most of the numerical works use the frozen - phonon ( adiabatic ) approximation @xcite and neglect dynamical effects .    in a previous paper we studied the role of dynamical phonons in the @xmath0 model with clusters of 10 and 16 sites including the phonon hilbert space @xcite .",
    "we found an instability to a charge density wave ( cdw ) for moderate e - ph interactions .",
    "however , due to the large size of the hilbert space , only a few phonon modes were included in the calculation . in this case",
    "the sensibility of our results with respect to the number of phonon modes is a matter of debate @xcite .    in order to check the validity of the truncation of the hilbert space in the number of phonon modes , we consider , as in other works @xcite , a small cluster ( four sites ) including all the phonon modes allowed by symmetry . in section",
    "ii we present models , approximations and results ; while in section iii we discuss the main conclusions of this study .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-holstein ( @xmath0-h ) model is :    @xmath1    where the first two terms correspond to the usual @xmath0 model , @xmath2 is the hopping term and @xmath3 is the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the creation and destruction operators of a hole in a simple occupied hilbert space , respectively .",
    "the following two term are the kinetic and elastic energy of ions with mass @xmath6 , and elastic force constant @xmath7 . finally , the last term is the holstein - type interaction between electrons and ions with strain @xmath8 . in this interaction",
    "the movement of the internal molecular degrees of freedom ( @xmath9 ) affect the electron density at a given site .",
    "this kind of interaction is important in htc superconductors @xcite . for the case of cuprates , this internal degree of freedom simulates the breathing mode , where the oxygens of the unit cell move toward the cu ion @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we are going to study the dynamics of one hole in a 4-sites cluster .",
    "0.3 cm * a)adiabatic phonon calculation * 0.3 cm in this approximation the kinetic energy of the ions is neglegible with respect to the other terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "this approximation is exact when the mass of the ions are infinite .",
    "we have a quantum problem with a classical variable @xmath9 .",
    "we minimize , iterativelly , the adiabatic potential @xmath10 $ ] starting from an initial displacement configuration @xmath11 . in each step of the iteration",
    ", we evaluate the ground state of the electronic system and the site electron density @xmath12 . using @xmath12 and the relation @xmath13",
    ", a new displacement set is obtained ; if it falls within a predetermined threshold from the initial , we stop the calculation , otherwise we iterate the procedure .",
    "we define the dimensionless electron - phonon constant @xmath14 . with this definition and rescalling @xmath15",
    "all the results can be writen in terms of @xmath16 for a given set of electronic parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we choose @xmath2 as unit of energy .",
    "we show in fig.1 the equilibrium displacement of a given site as a function of @xmath17 , for different values of @xmath3 . in order to describe our results we choose the most representative site displacement .",
    "we can distinguish two different regimes : @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 for our cluster @xcite .",
    "for @xmath3 smaller than @xmath21 the electronic model has a ferromagnetic ground state ( nagaoka regime ) .",
    "the hole moves as a free spinless fermion .",
    "therefore , like in the holstein model @xcite , we expect a transition towards a localized state at a critical value of @xmath16 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is possible to see in fig.1 that the transition occurs for @xmath23 and this value is practically independent of @xmath3 . for @xmath24",
    "the system presents a homogeneous phase , while for @xmath25 an abrupt transition towards a localized state occurs . in this state",
    "the hole is principally located in a given site and the equilibrium displacement associated with this site is larger than the other ones . in the figure",
    "we show the biggest displacement @xmath26 .",
    "there is also an increase of the hole occupation in this site , which shows the localization of the hole .",
    "this phase was previously interpreted as a ",
    " state of the system@xcite .",
    "we call this state  polaronic  even , at this stage of the calculation , the adiabatic condition is not broken down and a true polaron formation implies a mixing between the electronic and phononic degrees of freedom .    for @xmath27",
    "the transition towards a localized phase occurs at smaller @xmath28 , due to the preexisting self - localization of the hole in the antiferromagnetic background and the resulting band narrowing @xcite .",
    "we can also see that the transition is smoother , and before going to a ",
    " state the system undergoes a breathing type of deformation .",
    "this kind of phase is due to the nontrivial momentum value of the ground state of the system for @xmath29 @xcite . 0.3",
    "cm * b)full dynamics phonon calculation * 0.3 cm in the momentum space for the phononic degrees of freedom , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is :    @xmath30    at this stage the hamiltonian operates over the hilbert space of fermionic and bosonic variables . since the bosonic levels could be infinitely populated , we must adopt some criteria to render finite the dimension of our hilbert space . in the calculation",
    "we include all the phonon modes ( the zero mode is excluded because it represents only a change in the total energy ) .",
    "we populate each mode with the mimimum number of states for which we converge the observable under consideration .",
    "we find that 15-phonon states for each mode is enough , at least for not very large electron - phonon interaction .    for small frequencies and for @xmath31",
    "the system has an abrupt transition characterized by a rapid increases of the phonon occupation number @xmath32 for each mode .",
    "2a shows the occupacion number of the phonon @xmath33 @xmath34 as a function of @xmath16 for different values of @xmath3 and for @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath27 the transition is smoother and it takes place at small @xmath17 values .",
    "one important difference with the adiabatic case is that here the transition depends on @xmath16 even for @xmath36 .",
    "we have seen that the static phonon calculation always gives rise to a localization for @xmath37 .",
    "the localization is not obvious in the dynamical calculation , but the behaviour of the phonon occupation as a function of @xmath17 and the close agreement between @xmath22 obtained with both methods suggest that for @xmath38 the instablity is similar to that observed in the static case .",
    "we think that the adiabatic calculation is still valid for small values of @xmath39 .    for small @xmath17",
    "the phonon occupation is rather small indicating that the system is formed by renormalized electron and phonons .",
    "when the frequency increases the system is more stable as it is shown in fig.2b for @xmath40 .",
    "the transition towards a polaronic state is less evident than that for smaller @xmath39 .",
    "we conclude that the hole moves , as in a pure @xmath0 model , but with a bigger effective mass .",
    "it is important to point out that the static calculation underestimates the critical value of @xmath16 , which in our calculation seems to be large .",
    "thus the polaron occurs only for large @xmath16 and small @xmath41 values .",
    "we finish the section showing some results on the hubbard - holstein ( hh ) model .",
    "it is well known that the hubbard model could be mapped on the @xmath0 model with @xmath42 for @xmath43 . moreover , for @xmath44 the hh model has become the usual holstein model . therefore , for the hh model , it is interesting to study the crossover from the small polaron of the uncorrelated electron - phonon system to the one in the @xmath0 holstein model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hh model is :    @xmath45    similarly to the @xmath0-h case we are going to study the hh model using static and dynamic phonon approximations .",
    "the notation in the hamiltonian is standard .",
    "note that we are studing the one hole doped system ( 3 electrons in our cluster ) .",
    "this is different from the one particle problem previously studied by different authors@xcite .    in fig.3",
    "we show the adiabatic calculation of a site deformation ( the biggest deformated one ) as a function of @xmath16 for different values of @xmath46 ( the analogue of fig . 1 for the @xmath0-h model ) .",
    "4 we show the occupation of the ( @xmath47 ) mode ( dynamic calculation ) .    for a very large @xmath46 ( @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is of order of @xmath50 ) the model behaves like the @xmath0-h model .",
    "that means : we obtain an abrupt transition from a totally delocalized state to a full localized state .",
    "this transition occurs for @xmath16 @xmath51 .",
    "this is exactly what happens for the @xmath0-h model for @xmath31 . when @xmath46 decreases @xmath52 also decreases and the transition is less abruted .",
    "we found , like for the @xmath0 model case , that before going to the polaron state the system has the breathing - type state for @xmath53 .",
    "note the following different behaviour between the @xmath0-h and hh model : in the former @xmath52 always decreases as @xmath3 increases showing the strong self - localization of the hole in the antiferromagnetic backgroung . in the hh model case @xmath52",
    "goes to a finite value when @xmath46 goes to zero , this is precisely the threshold for the appearence of the polaronic band in the pure holstein model .    for small @xmath39 and large u",
    "the average of the phonon occupation presents an abrupt transition at a given value of @xmath28 which is close to the @xmath22 obtained using adiabatic approximation .",
    "moreover , for small u and large @xmath41 the transition is smoother and occurs at smaller @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , stability of the system is reinforced when both @xmath39 and @xmath46 increase .",
    "in this paper we have studied the stability of correlated electronic systems under the influence of a holstein electron - phonon interaction .",
    "both @xmath0 and hubbard models have been analized using adiabiatic and dynamical phonon approximations .",
    "*  polaronic instability for the electron - phonon couplings @xmath37 . *  the critical value of the electron - phonon interaction decreases as j increases .",
    "this is a consequence of the preexisting self - localization for the pure @xmath0 model case . *",
    "the critical electron - phonon coupling is @xmath3- independent in the nagaoka regime ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "* in the nagoka regime the transition towards a polaron is rather abrupt while it is smoother when @xmath27 .    treating the phonon dynamically we found that most of the results obtained adiabatically are still valid for finite but small @xmath41 values .",
    "a difference is that the value of @xmath22 obtained in the dynamical case is not independent of @xmath3 for the @xmath18 regime .",
    "we have also performed a calculation for the hubbard model . in this model",
    "most of conclusions made for the @xmath0 model were recovered for large u. for small u the stability of the system tends to that of the pure holstein model and the critical @xmath17 goes to a finite value when u goes to zero .",
    "when this paper has been finished we received a preprint of wellein , roeder and fehske @xcite where the holstein hubbard and @xmath0 holstein models were studied on finite cluster up to ten sites by an exact diagonalization technique .",
    "the main results of this paper are consistent with the ones obtained here . moreover , for one hole doped @xmath0-h model they found evidence for the appeareance of a polaronic state from a critical value of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "as this value is similar to the one obtained in our paper , we believe that finite size effect are not very important . we thank dr .",
    "fehske for sending us a copy of his paper prior its publication ."
