    "a large number of objects with sub - stellar mass are now known , with masses ranging from the hydrogen burning limit that divides stars from brown dwarfs ( bds ; m@xmath5@xmath6 m@xmath3 ) to values comparable to the mass of giant planets and below the deuterium burning limit ( @xmath7 0.013 m@xmath3 ) .",
    "their discovery in regions of star formation has provoked an intense debate on the formation mechanism of such objects .",
    "do they form , as solar mass stars do , from the collapse of a molecular core ( shu et al .",
    "are they stellar embryos , whose further growth is prevented by dynamical ejections from small stellar systems ( reipurth & clarke  @xcite ; bate et al .",

    "is expected from studies of the circumstellar disks ( if any ) associated with sub - stellar objects , since different theories make very different predictions .",
    "disks are a necessary step in any formation mechanism that involves accretion from a parental core .",
    "if bds form from core collapse , they should be associated to disks similar in properties to those found around low mass pre - main  sequence  stars ( t tauri stars ; tts ) .",
    "a prediction of the stellar embryo theory is that the disks should be truncated by the ejection mechanism , so that they should be small and short - lived . in the",

    "one of these objects is a bona - fide bd , while the two others are close to the threshold between stars and bds .",
    "we found that the excess emission was clearly detectable only in the mid - infrared , because the stellar photosphere overwhelms the disk emission in the three near - infrared bands .",
    "the observed seds are well described by disk models similar to those of tts , assuming that the heating is due to irradiation from the central star .",
    "this first result provides strong support for the idea that bds form like stars , from the contraction of a molecular core .",
    "hence , we decided to extend our study of disk properties to a larger number of substellar mass objects in regions of star formation , possibly down to objects of few jupiter masses . with this in mind , we selected a small but well defined sample of nine objects in the @xmath0oph  region , that were detected by isocam at both 6.7 and 14.3 @xmath1 m  ( bontemps et al .",
    "we obtained near - infrared spectra for all of them ( see  2 ) , which we used to derive the basic parameters of the central objects , namely effective temperature , luminosity and mass (  3 ) . because of the adopted selection criteria , all of these objects have excess emission in the mid - ir .",

    "we have therefore subtracted the maximum contribution expected from an irradiated disk ( flared , seen face - on ; see  4 ) from the observed spectra .",

    "the results are shown in fig.[mags ] , where we compare model predictions and observations for the 6 stars for which i - band photometry was obtained .",
    "the agreement of the i - band observed and predicted magnitudes is generally rather good , given the extreme sensitivity of the model predictions to the exact shape of the i - band filter , with the possible exception of # 032 , which would need =3 mag , rather than the 2 mag determined from the comparison with field dwarfs .",

    "as pointed out in paper i , most of the disk parameters are irrelevant for the calculation of the mid - infrared disk emission , or appear in combinations , and can not be determined individually ( see also chiang et al .",
    "as long as the disk midplane remains optically thick to mid - infrared radiation , the only parameters that affect the sed in the near and mid - infrared are the geometrical shape of the disk ( i.e. , the flaring angle ) , the inclination to the line of sight and , to some degree , the disk inner radius @xmath27 .",
    "there is also some dependence of the shape of the sed on the surface dust model ; however , since the luminosity intercepted and re - radiated by the optically thin surface layers is fixed , variations due to ( reasonable ) changes of the grain properties are well within the uncertainty of the existing observations .",
    "the upper solid curves in fig .  [ seds ] show the seds of flared disks with @xmath27=r@xmath5 , seen face - on .",
    "they all have strong silicate emission at 10 @xmath1 m  and a rather flat spectral slope between the two iso bands at 6.7 and 14.3 @xmath1 m , of order @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "if , rather than extending all the way to the stellar surface the disk is truncated further out , as predicted by magnetospheric accretion models in tts , at each radius the surface of a flared disk intercepts and reprocesses a larger fraction of the stellar radiation .",
    "the disk emission increases correspondingly at all wavelengths but in the near - infrared , where one is sensitive to the lack of the hottest disk dust . a model with @xmath30 3r@xmath5is shown ( dashed line ) for # 033 , where , as discussed in paper ii , the inner hole may account for the large observed mid - infrared excess .",
    "large variations of the predicted sed occur if the disk shape changes . on each panel , we show the predictions of geometrically thin ,  flat \" disks ( lower solid lines ) , i.e. , disks where the grains are not well mixed with the gas , but have collapsed onto the disk midplane . also for these models , we have adopted the cg97 formalism , which remains adequate in all the cases where the disk heating is dominated by the stellar irradiation . if the surface contribution to the sed were negligible , one would recover for these disks the well known temperature profile @xmath31 and the power - law slope of the sed @xmath32 ( adams and shu @xcite ) .",
    "our calculations show that also in flat disks the surface contributes to the mid - infrared flux , as shown by the presence in the sed of the silicate feature in emission ; however , the midplane emission is larger than the surface contribution at all wavelengths but in the region @xmath2",
    "812 @xmath1 m , where the silicate feature dominates , so that the spectral slope between the two iso points is always very close to 4/3 . at all wavelengths",
    "larger than @xmath2 2.5 @xmath1 m , the emission of a flat disk is significantly lower than that of a flared one .",
    "finally , we show on three panels of fig .",
    "[ seds ] the predictions of tilted flared disks , seen by the observer with inclinations of 69@xmath33 ( # 102 ) , 80@xmath33 ( # 164 ) and 86@xmath33 ( # 193 ) respectively ( 0@xmath33 for face - on disks ) .",
    "the comparison of the iso observations to the model predictions shows that irradiated disk models can account for the observed mid - infrared excess .",
    "more precisely , and in spite of the large uncertainties of the iso data , inspection of fig .",
    "[ seds ] shows that there are five stars out of nine ( # 030 , # 032 , # 102 , # 160 , # 176 ) that are extremely well fit by flat disk models .",
    "two objects ( # 023 and # 033 ) seem to require flared , face - on disks , while two others have a lower mid - infrared excess , consistent with disks seen rather edge - on .",
    "however , given the large error bars and the model uncertainties , most objects with flat disks are also consistent with flared disk models with large inclination , as shown for the case of # 102 .",
    "the agreement between the object spectra and those of field dwarfs is good beyond our expectations .",
    "the largest differences are of 20% at most , generally at the peak of the h band , with no systematic difference between objects with large or low extinction , nor between stronger and weaker sources .",
    "even the relatively narrow features that appear in the spectra around 1.1 @xmath1 m  are often well matched in the two sets of spectra .",
    "this indicates that , at the resolution of our observations , one should not expect strong gravity effects .",
    "we have checked that this is indeed the case by comparing model atmosphere spectra smoothed to the observed resolution for stars of different gravity ( allard et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ranging from 3.5 to 6.0 .",
    "all the models with gravity in the interval 3.55.0 are practically identical , at our spectral resolution and in this temperature range .",
    "the comparison of our spectra with model atmosphere predictions is somewhat less satisfactory , especially in the h band , where the shape of the feature peaked at about 1.7 @xmath1 m  ( resulting from water absorption features at shorter and longer wavelengths ) is narrower in the models than observed , and around 1.3 @xmath1 m , where the models tend to predict more emission than is observed .",
    "note , however , that this is not always the case ( see , for example , # 032 and # 164 ) . still , the agreement is in general rather good , with differences that never reach more 30% , again with no dependence on the extinction nor on the observed signal .",
    "the comparison of our determinations of the photospheric parameters of individual objects with previous spectroscopic determinations in the literature shows that in some cases there is good agreement , while in others there are discrepancies that are not easily understood .",
    "for example , wilking et al .",
    "( @xcite ) assign similar spectral types to # 023 , # 030 , but a significantly later one ( m8.5 ) to # 164 , based on k band r@xmath2300 spectroscopy .",
    "for the same object , luhman & rieke  ( @xcite ) estimate a spectral type m7 , based on intermediate resolution k band spectroscopy , similar to our classification m6 .",

    "the case of # 033 ( gy  11 ) has been discussed in detail in paper  ii .",
    "a likely reason for differences in the spectral classification is that our scheme is based on the overall spectral shape , while the others rely on fitting individual spectral features , which in the infrared show large scatter for late m objects ( e.g. , luhman & rieke  @xcite ) .    on the more general issue of the effective temperature scale of young bds",
    ", we attribute temperatures in the range 2600 - 2700 k to our group of objects with spectral types m6m7.5 .",
    "our only object with later spectral type ( m8.5 ) has t@xmath15=2400@xmath12100 k. in a preliminary analysis of our sample field dwarfs ( testi et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we derive a similar effective temperature - spectral type correspondence .",
    "this is not significantly different from the scale used by wilking et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in their study of candidate bds in @xmath0oph .",
    "it is , however , at odds with some recent results , that tend to attribute to young bds of similar spectral types temperatures higher than our values ( lucas et al .",
    "@xcite ; lodieu et al .",
    "@xcite ) . further work , on larger samples of bds in young star forming regions is clearly required .",
    "the comparison between models and observations , discussed in the previous section , proves that the mid - infrared excess associated to many young bds can be accounted for by the emission of circumstellar disks heated by the radiation of the central object .",
    "few disk properties are constrained by the existing observations , and we do not want to overinterpret our results , given the large uncertainties of the observed fluxes , and the simplicity of the adopted models . however , in our limited sample of nine stars we find disks of different flavours , and , in particular , an indication that many bds may have flat disks . if we consider also the three objects in cha i studied in paper i , we have three objects with clear evidence of flared disks , and nine where flat disks seem more appropriate , although we can not rule out almost edge - on flared disks for some of them ( see also apai et al .",
    "this is potentially an interesting result , since it seems natural to associate flat disks with dust sedimentation toward the midplane . in our selection of iso sources",
    ", we have an obvious strong bias against objects with flat disks , since we required that the sources were detected by iso in both bands .",
    "so , the fact that our objects with the lowest 6.7 @xmath1 m  fluxes (  and # 033 ) have flared disks is not surprising .",
    "however , there is no bias against selecting flared disk objects of higher luminosity , and we find only one ( # 023 ) .",
    "the possibility of dust settling in these very young low - mass objects is intriguing .",
    "however , it needs to be confirmed by high - quality photometric observations at longer wavelengths , before entering into further speculations .    the ejected embryos hypothesis does not exclude that bds may have a small , and therefore short - lived , circumstellar disk .",
    "estimates by bate et al .",
    "( @xcite ) give disk radii of about 20 au or less .",
    "the existing infrared data do not allow us to rule out such possibility , since the sed of a model with r@xmath19=20 au will differ from the sed of a disk with r@xmath19=75 au only at wavelengths @xmath34 40 @xmath1 m .",
    "the mass of the disk is not predicted by the bate et al .",
    "( @xcite ) calculations , nor constrained by the existing observations , since the only constraint we can set is that the disk has to be optically thick in the mid - infrared .",
    "this , however , only requires a disk mass of 10@xmath3510@xmath36 m@xmath3(or m@xmath19/mstar@xmath37 ) , which is still consistent with a typical disk ( having m@xmath19/mstar@xmath2 0.03 , r@xmath19=75 au ) , truncated at r@xmath19=20 au . until far - infrared and millimeter data become available ,",
    "the only way to validate these models is to determine the fraction of disks in unbiased samples of bds of known age .",
    "finally , one should remember that our analysis relies on the assumption that the iso sources coincide with the objects we identify in the near - infrared . in some cases",
    ", this is likely to be true ( see appendix  [ images ] and the discussion of # 033 in paper  ii ) .",
    "in other cases , it is impossible to check the validity of this assumption , given the large iso beam and the presence of other red objects in the near - infrared images .",
    "however , the good agreement between the observations and the model predictions , which depend essentially only on the stellar properties we derive from the spectroscopy , is encouraging .",
    "further tests of the association of the observed mid - infrared excess with the identified stars could be obtained by accurate images in the l and m bands , where we predict that the disk emission should be dominant ( see fig .  [ seds ] ) .",
    "we have discussed in this paper a sample of nine very low - mass objects in the @xmath0oph  star forming region that have evidence for circumstellar warm dust .",
    "we selected from the isocam sample of bontemps et al .",
    "( @xcite ) those objects that have mid - infrared detections in both the 6.7 and the 14.3 @xmath1 m  bands , relatively low extinction and low luminosity .",
    "we determined first if these bd candidates were indeed bona - fide bds , and then we checked if the observed infrared excess was consistent with the predictions of disk models , similar in properties to those associated to t tauri stars .",
    "our strategy was very successfull .",
    "the low - resolution near - infrared spectra obtained at the tng allowed us to determine for each object spectral type and extinction , by comparison with field dwarfs observed with the same instrumental set - up , as well as effective temperature and luminosity , by comparison with model atmosphere predictions .",
    "the comparison with various sets of evolutionary tracks on the hr diagram shows that all the nine sources are very young , low - mass objects .",
    "in particular , one ( # 033 or gy 11 , already discussed in paper ii ) has a mass of 8 - 12 m@xmath4 , while the others have masses in the bd mass range ; four of them are very likely bona - fide bds .    in all objects ,",
    "the mid - infrared excess is consistent with the predictions of disks irradiated by the central object .",
    "we find no evidence of strong accretion occurring in these systems , based on the fact the observed near - infrared fluxes are dominated by the emission of the photospheres , and there is very little contribution ( if any ) from hot dust .",
    "however , it is not clear to which degree the near - infrared excess in very low - luminosity objects is a sensitive indicator of accretion ( see , for an example of an actively accreting object with no near - infrared excess , fernndez & comern @xcite ) , and this issue should be explored more quantitatively in the future .",
    "the existing data indicate that the disks must be optically thick at mid - infrared wavelengths ; in some cases they must be flared ( i.e. , gas - rich with well - mixed dust and gas ) , while in others it is possible that they are geometrically flat , i.e. , that dust has settled to the disk midplane .",
    "however , data at longer wavelengths are necessary to further investigate this point , and we do not want to put too much weight on this rather weak evidence .    in the same sobering vein ,",
    "we want to point out that our results do not discriminate yet between different formation mechanisms , namely between the possibility that bds form from the gravitational collapse of individual , very low - mass cores , and the ejected embryo theory .",
    "we fit the observed mid - infrared excess with a scaled - down version of disks around the more massive tts .",
    "this , however , just implies that  normal \" disks can account for the existing observations , since few parameters are actually constrained .",
    "as already pointed out in paper i and ii , only observations at long wavelengths can measure the disk radius and mass , since the lower limits that we can derive from the conditions that the disk is optically thick in the mid - infrared are hardly significant .",
    "having stressed all the limitations of our results , let us now point out that this is the first sample of very low mass objects in a star forming regions where evidence for circumstellar disks has been found and investigated in detail .",
    "our accurate near - infrared spectroscopy , which allows us to estimate a reliable value of the mass of the objects , proves that disks exist around low mass objects , well into the range of brown dwarfs . in one case , # 033 ,",
    "our data provide strong indications that an object with mass close to or below the deuterium burning limit also has a circumstellar disk .",
    "in addition to providing the beginning of a census of disk properties around bds , our models indicate that the excess due to the cold disks irradiated by a central bd can only be detected by deep photometry in the l and m bands .",
    "we expect that major progress in our understanding of bd formation will be obtained by combining near - infrared low resolution spectroscopy with photometry in j , h , k , l , m of unbiased ( i.e. , not a - priori selected because they have a mid - infrared excess , as here ) samples of bd candidates in star forming regions of different age .",
    "we thank carsten dominik and michael meyer for useful discussions .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge the tng and eso staff for their excellent support during observations .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "this work was partly supported by asi grant ars 1/r/27/00 to the osservatorio di arcetri .",
    "fig .  [ fcharts ] shows 2.2 @xmath1 m  finding charts for eight of the nine sources discussed in this paper .",
    "the grey scale images have been obtained at the tng with nics ( # 023 , # 030 , # 032 ) by us on july 2001 , at eso / ut1 with isaac ( # 033 ) and at eso / ntt with sofi ( # 102 , # 160 , # 164 , # 176 ) .",
    "the isaac and sofi data have been extracted from the eso science archive ; they have been originally obtained for eso proposals 63.i0691 , 65.i0576 , 67.c0325 and 67.c0349 .",
    "finding chart for # 193 can be obtained from the 2mass database at http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu . for sources # 023 , # 030 and # 033 ,",
    "contours show the isocam - lw1 emission ( comern et al .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the accuracy of the method used to derive extinction , spectral types and effective temperatures from the low - resolution near infrared spectra . for this purpose",
    "we will discuss the derivation of the parameters for three extreme cases , the source with the highest extinction ( # 023 ) , the source with the lowest extinction ( # 032 ) , and the later spectral type source ( # 033 ) .",
    "the procedure starts with the determination of the extinction and spectral type based on the comparison with field dwarfs spectra obtained with the same instrumental setup ( testi et al .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) . for each source",
    "we compare the observed spectrum with those of the field dwarfs reddened by different amounts , the value of the extinction is varied until the best match is found with some of the field dwarfs . in practice , we varied the value of a@xmath14 in steps of 0.5 mags , since smaller variations can not be significantly distinguished in the comparison .    in the top panels of figure  [ fa23 ] we show this comparison for source # 023 and for three values of a@xmath387 , 8 , and 9 .",
    "the best matches , based on the shapes of the j and h bands , and the fact that the source spectrum at k can not be lower than the field dwarfs , to allow for a possible contribution from disk emission , are found for a@xmath388  mags and spectral types between m6 and m7.5 .",
    "once the spectral type and extinction have been estimated , the source spectrum is compared with appropriate surface gravity ( log(g)=3.5 ) model atmospheres ( allard et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which provide an estimate for the effective temperature and an additional check on the extinction . in the bottom panels of figure  [ fa23 ] we present this comparison for source # 023 .",
    "the comparison with the atmospheres confirms that the estimate of a@xmath388  mags provides the best match , and show that the two models that match more closely the observed spectrum are those with temperature 2600 and 2700  k , hence the best estimate that we derive is t@xmath15=2650  k , with an uncertainty of @xmath39  k.    in figure  [ fa32 ] we show the procedure for the source in our sample with the lowest value of the extinction ( # 032 ) .",
    "given the lower extinction , the spectrum clearly shows some features in the j - band that correspond to the combination of several blended photospheric absorption lines and bands .",
    "also in this case we show the comparison with field dwarfs for three values of a@xmath14 spaced by 1 magnitude . in this case , it is possible to obtain a good match with a later spectral type and a lower extinction ( a@xmath40 , m8.5 ) ; however , the match with m7.5 and a@xmath382  mags is the best .",
    "this choice of the extinction is confirmed by the comparison with the model atmospheres in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "the effective temperature is estimated to be 2600@xmath12100  k , as for the previous source .",
    "the source for which the derivation of the parameters is most complicated is # 033 ( fig .",
    "[ fa33 ] ) because of the high extinction and the lower signal to noise of the spectrum . in this case",
    "good matches can be obtained for the lower extinction and later spectral type , a@xmath386  mag m9.0 , as well as higher extinction and earlier spectral type , a@xmath388  mag m7.5 .",
    "the comparison with model atmospheres would favor the higher extinction .",
    "thus , also considering the uncertainties in the model atmospheres at these spectral types ( see e.g. leggett et al .",
    "@xcite ) , our best estimates are : a@xmath387.5@xmath121  mag , m8.5 with one subclass uncertainty and t@xmath15=2400@xmath12100  k."
