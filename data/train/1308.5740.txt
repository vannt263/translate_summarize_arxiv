    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite is a useful tool to study strongly correlated condensed matter systems using a classical theory of general relativity in asymptotically ads spacetime . for example , charged ads black holes dressed with a complex scalar field have been investigated as a holographic gravity model of a superfluid or a superconductor  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a nice review of holographic superconductor models ) .",
    "although typical phenomena of superconductors such as energy gap are explained by the gravity model , there was a serious defect in the model ; there is no mechanism of momentum dissipation , as translational invariance is imposed .",
    "this implies that even in the non - superconducting state , current is conserved and the dc - conductivity becomes infinite .    in condensed matter systems ,",
    "momentum conservation is not generally satisfied via umklapp scattering process since translational invariance is broken by the presence of an ionic lattice or impurity . to incorporate the dissipation mechanism in the holographic model ,",
    "charged ads black holes with no translational symmetry has been constructed perturbatively or numerically in the non - superconducting state  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , conductivity in the normal phase has been investigated and it was shown that the drude peak appears instead of delta function at zero frequency .",
    "this indicates that the holographic model yields finite dc - conductivity in the normal phase . in the superconducting state ,",
    "charged hairly ads black hole solutions with an ionic lattice has been constructed and it has been shown that delta function appears , indicating the existence of a superfluid component  @xcite . this agrees with an earlier result derived from a toy model of holographic superconductors , showing that the delta function is stable against adding a lattice  @xcite .    the appearance of the superfluid component shown in ref .",
    "@xcite predicts the existence of `` persistent current''in the holographic superconductor model with no translational symmetry . in condensed matter systems",
    ", it appears as a result of macroscopic quantum coherence state and the `` persistent current '' does not decay  ( at least within the age of our universe ) .",
    "so , it is quite interesting to construct such a black hole solution in ads with `` persistent current '' to realize a macroscopic quantum coherence state in the classical theory of general relativity dual to the superconducting state . even in the normal  ( non - superconducting ) state , there are several results indicating that there should be `` persistent current '' in the zero temperature limit  @xcite .",
    "@xcite analytically showed that momentum relaxation rate is given as a function of a positive power of temperature by computing retarded green s functions at low temperature and frequencies for a static black hole in @xmath0  ( see also @xcite for a different system from the present one , in which there is a static black hole solution that corresponds to an insulating phase in which dc - conductivity decreases as temperature goes to zero . ) .",
    "@xcite numerically estimated the relaxation time from the drude form and found that it becomes infinite as temperature goes to zero in the presence of a non - perturbative lattice .",
    "these results suggest that if momentum or current is initially given , it does not decay in the zero temperature limit even in the presence of an ionic lattice . in other words , there should be extremal charged stationary black hole solutions where horizon has nonzero velocity with respect to the lattice , corresponding to the existence of `` persistent current '' in the dual field theory side .    from the perspective of classical general relativity",
    ", the rigidity theorem  @xcite guarantees the existence of an additional symmetry for such a stationary black hole : it states that if a stationary black hole is non - static and the horizon cross - sections are compact , then there must be a one - parameter cyclic isometry group which is spacelike near infinity .",
    "note that in order to prove the theorem , the analyticity is required . in the presence of a lattice , it is clear that such a killing symmetry which would correspond to the translational symmetry for the planar horizon case does not exist if the analyticity on the ads black holes is imposed .",
    "so , it agrees with the observation in the dual field theory side that initial current or momentum decays according to the finite dc resistivity  ( or finite momentum relaxation rate ) in finite temperature case . even in the zero temperature case , a version of the rigidity theorem still holds  @xcite and no counter - example has been found until now .",
    "this implies that unless analyticity on the horizon ( or other relevant technical conditions ) is violated , one would not be able to construct an extremal black hole with `` persistent current . ''",
    "although there have been several studies  @xcite on dc resistivity by perturbing static charged ads black holes , little is known about the nature of charged ads black holes with momentum or current .",
    "motivated by this , we investigate how initial momentum or current of the ads black holes decays in the presence of an ionic lattice in the normal state . in the absence of a lattice ,",
    "charged ads black hole solutions with `` persistent current '' can be constructed by boosting planar reissner - nordstrm ads black hole solution . in this paper , as a first step , we investigate the stability of the black holes against a perturbed ionic lattice and how thermalization occurs by losing the momentum . in addition , we examine if the extremal black hole with `` persistent current '' exists in the zero temperature limit , avoiding the apparent inconsistency between no translational symmetry due to the lattice structure and the consequence of a killing symmetry due to the rigidity theorem for stationary black holes .",
    "the perturbation is given by adding a small spatially varying chemical potential , corresponding to the spatially varying gauge potential at infinity . at first order in the perturbation , there is no dissipation and we can construct charged ads black hole solutions with `` persistent current '' in the presence of the ionic lattice . at second order in the perturbation , however , dissipation occurs and the momentum is lost by the lattice .",
    "we conduct perturbation analysis by exploiting the gauge invariant formalism developed by kodama - ishibashi  @xcite .",
    "we first numerically calculate the momentum relaxation rate from the two - decoupled scalar mode equation and investigate the dependence of the temperature and the velocity of the black hole . for a fixed temperature ,",
    "the momentum relaxation rate is proportional to the velocity of the black hole and it does not decay to zero in the zero temperature limit .",
    "we next obtain the analytical expression of the momentum relaxation rate and the entropy production rate in the wkb formalism in the large limit of the wave number of the lattice .",
    "we also show that the physical process version of the first law is satisfied in the irreversible process and that thermalization always occurs by losing the momentum , being independent of the temperature .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first derive two master equations of the scalar mode perturbations and mention to the boundary conditions in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we numerically calculate the momentum relaxation rate for various temperature and wave numbers . in sec .",
    "iv , we obtain an analytical expression of the momentum relaxation rate in the wkb formalism .",
    "we also calculate the entropy production rate under the wkb approximation and derive the physical process version of the first law of the black hole in the irreversible process in sec .  v. sec .",

    "another key difference is that the process continues until the momentum of the boosted black hole becomes zero .    in this section ,",
    "we calculate the entropy production rate under the wkb approximation , following the hawking - hartle formula  @xcite .",
    "we also check that the first law of the black hole is satisfied in the irreversible process and that thermalization occurs .",
    "let @xmath215 and @xmath216 respectively be the expansion and the shear of the null geodesic congruence @xmath217 along the horizon .",
    "the evolution equations are given by @xmath218 where @xmath219 is a component of the weyl tensor in the newman - penrose formalism  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath8 is the surface gravity on the horizon given in eq .",
    "( [ generator_temperature ] ) .",
    "since we consider perturbations around the stationary black hole , @xmath215 is very small and hence @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath220 can be expanded as @xmath221 let us define an advanced coordinate @xmath222 as @xmath223 , where it coincides with the time coordinate @xmath224 at infinity introduced in sec .",
    "then , @xmath225 and , as shown in appendix a , we obtain @xmath226 where @xmath227 is an element of surface of the null congruence on the horizon defined by @xmath228 since @xmath227 is proportional to the entropy density per unit area @xmath107 , eq .",
    "( [ area_variation ] ) describes the entropy production rate per unit time @xmath229 in the static lattice frame .    near the horizon ,",
    "the component of the weyl tensor , @xmath219 is represented by the master variable @xmath47  ( [ def_masterphi ] ) as @xmath230 to derive the second equality , we used @xmath231 and the approximation @xmath232 near the horizon . substituting eq .",
    "( [ weyl ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq_raychaudhuri ] ) and replacing @xmath233 , we obtain @xmath234 as @xmath235    from eqs .",
    "( [ master_phi_pm ] ) and ( [ phi_a_phi_pm ] ) , @xmath47 reduces to @xmath236 under the wkb approximation .",
    "then , at the leading order in @xmath25 , the spatial average of @xmath237 becomes @xmath238    in the wkb approximation , the magnitudes of @xmath45 and @xmath47 are very small , as @xmath239 , @xmath240 by eq .",
    "( [ phi_a_phi_pm ] ) .",
    "so , the metric components near the horizon are also small as @xmath241 , by eqs .",
    "( [ eq_h ] ) and ( [ x_z_horizon ] ) .",
    "this implies that the metric fluctuation near the horizon does vanish in the large @xmath25 limit and the second term in the r.  h.  s. of eq .",
    "( [ area_variation ] ) is simplified to @xmath242 therefore , by eqs .",
    "( [ area_variation ] ) , ( [ sol_shear ] ) , ( [ phi_average ] ) , and ( [ ricci_average ] ) ,",
    "we finally obtain @xmath243 by eqs ( [ generator_temperature ] ) , ( [ def : entropy_density ] ) , ( [ momentum_loss_rate _ wkb ] ) , ( [ energy_loss_rate ] ) , and ( [ area_average ] ) , it is easy to check that the first law in the dynamical process is satisfied ; @xmath244 where @xmath245 and @xmath246 are the energy density @xmath247 and the momentum density @xmath248 of the background spacetime , respectively .",
    "this equation means that @xmath246 must decrease to satisfy the second law of the black hole thermodynamics , @xmath249 . in other words ,",
    "the momentum relaxation by the ionic lattice is an irreversible process associated with the entropy production .",
    "the thermalization is guaranteed in the irreversible process as follows .",
    "the deviation of the temperature @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ generator_temperature ] ) becomes @xmath250 here , we used the facts that @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 , which represents @xmath254 , to derive the second inequality . in the third inequality , we used @xmath255 .",
    "( [ thermalization ] ) means that the kinetic energy associated with the initial momentum is converted into thermal energy , and then , the temperature increases during the irreversible process .",
    "we have investigated adiabatic evolution of charged boosted ads black holes by perturbation of an ionic lattice . at linear order in the perturbation , we constructed charged stationary ads black hole solutions with an ionic lattice . at second order",
    ", however , the momentum relaxation occurs by the lattice and the rate of momentum loss is proportional to the velocity of the black hole , as shown in sec .",
    "iii . in conventional condensed matter systems ,",
    "the equation of motion for an electron with charge @xmath256 , mass @xmath257 , and velocity @xmath82 is effectively given by @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the electric field and @xmath260 is a positive constant determined by temperature and so on . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ effective_dissipation_law ] ) , we have verified that the equation is satisfied in the presence of initial velocity when the electric field is zero .",
    "the coefficient @xmath152 in eq .",
    "( [ effective_dissipation_law ] ) corresponding to the coefficient @xmath260 is a complicated function of temperature , but it never becomes zero in the zero temperature limit .",
    "this is supported by the analysis of wkb approximation in sec .",
    "this indicates that `` persistent current '' can not exist in a condensed matter system that is dual to the present charged ads black hole at zero temperature .",
    "even though this result itself is consistent with the rigidity theorem for stationary black holes , there seems to be an apparent discrepancy between our result and the previous results  @xcite which state that dc - conductivity becomes infinite at zero temperature .",
    "one of the reasons is that we calculate non - linear perturbations beyond a linear response theory , as mentioned in sec .",
    "another reason is that we take into account the effect of non - zero current at zeroth order in the perturbations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rate of momentum loss can be obtained by calculating retarded green s functions of the perturbed gauge potential @xmath261 in the limit of zero frequency , @xmath262 for a static black hole in @xmath0 . in our setting ,",
    "the perturbation of the gauge potential @xmath2 is given by @xmath263 in the frame where the black hole has initial momentum or velocity @xmath82 .",
    "if we consider the perturbation in another frame where the velocity of the black hole is zero , the form becomes @xmath264  ( @xmath187 ) , implying that the lattice is moving along @xmath265-direction with constant velocity @xmath266 .",
    "thus , in such a static black hole frame , the perturbations correspond to non - zero frequencies @xmath267 , being different from the perturbation considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the static black hole frame",
    ", energy is always pumped from the boundary into the bulk by the moving lattice and then , the initially static black hole starts moving until the velocity of the black hole reaches the one of the lattice . during the pumping",
    ", the energy is always absorbed into the black hole and the entropy is produced during the process .",
    "this means that thermalization always occurs even in the zero temperature limit , as shown in sec .",
    "v. in the original frame where the black hole has initial momentum and velocity , the velocity continues to decrease until it becomes zero , keeping the total energy fixed . since the entropy production is independent of the frame , we have clarified the dissipation mechanism of the momentum loss caused by the `` friction '' between the lattice and the velocity of the black hole . as a consistency check ,",
    "we have also derived the first law of black hole in the irreversible process .",
    "although our analysis is limited to the framework of perturbation , we expect that the same result should also be obtained even for fully dynamical , non - perturbative case",
    ". it would be interesting to explore non - perturbative dynamics of the present system by using numerical methods .",
    "there remains several open questions .",
    "for example , how can our result be interpreted in the dual field theory side ? within the framework of our present analysis ,",
    "the current always decays even in zero temperature and therefore the lattice can not be interpreted as a perfect lattice , contrary to the prediction of [ 4 ] .",
    "one possibility would be that there is a residual resistance in the strongly coupled field theory dual to the black hole .",
    "the residual resistance can be caused by impurity or strong interactions between quasiparticles even in the zero temperature .",
    "it is interesting to explore our result from the perspective of the dual field theory .",
    "another open question is whether one can construct black hole solutions in the presence of ionic lattice dual to a superconducting state with `` persistent current . ''",
    "to reconcile with the symmetry consequence of the rigidity theorem , we need to construct a black hole solution with momentum where the horizon is static with respect to the lattice but some condensation of complexed scalar field outside the horizon moves along the lattice .",
    "it would be reported in the near future  @xcite .",
    "we wish to thank gary t.  horowitz for valuable discussions .",
    "it is also a pleasure to acknowledge helpful discussions with s.  a.  hartnoll .",
    "k.  m. is supported in part by mext / jsps kakenhi grant number 2374022 .",

    "integration of the first equation in eqs .",
    "( [ eq_raychaudhuri ] ) yields @xmath268 substituting eq .",
    "( [ sol1_expansion ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ def_sigma ] ) and integrating it by once , we obtain @xmath269= \\frac{2\\epsilon^2}{\\kappa_*}(e^{\\kappa _ * v_{*1}}-1)\\int^\\infty_{v_{*1}}e^{-\\kappa _ * v _ * } \\left(|\\sigma_{(1)}|^2+\\frac{1}{2}{\\cal t}_{(2 ) } \\right)dv _ * \\nonumber \\\\ & \\qquad+\\frac{2\\epsilon^2}{\\kappa_*}\\int^{v_{*1}}_0 ( 1-e^{-\\kappa _ * v _ * } ) \\left(|\\sigma_{(1)}|^2+\\frac{1}{2}{\\cal t}_{(2 ) } \\right)dv_*. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first teleological term in the r.  h.  s. necessarily appears because a black hole is defined as a region from which light can not escape to infinity .",
