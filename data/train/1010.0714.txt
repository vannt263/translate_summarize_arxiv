    "in the past few years , intensive experimental efforts have taken place at major laboratories around the world to study the baryon spectra using the electromagnetic probes . on the theoretical side ,",
    "since the baryon resonances are unstable and couple strongly to baryon - meson continuum states , coupled - channel models are needed to analyze the experimental data and to interpret the extracted resonance parameters . for our present study",
    ", we employ the well - known jlich @xmath0 model @xcite that is based on time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "it is a coupled - channel meson - exchange model which includes the @xmath0 and @xmath1 stable channels as well as the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 effective channels accounting for the resonant part of the @xmath10 channel .",
    "the interaction kernel corresponding to the @xmath11- and @xmath12-channel diagrams is constructed based on the chiral lagrangians of wess and zumino @xcite , supplemented by additional terms for the coupling of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite . for the @xmath18-channel diagrams ,",
    "apart from the bare nucleon dressed by the coupling to the @xmath0 continuum state to reproduce the physical nucleon , the interaction kernel includes eight genuine bare resonances , namely @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the bare genuine resonances get their dressed masses and widths from the re - scattering of the baryon - meson continuum states ; the @xmath27 ( roper ) resonance appears as a dynamically generated resonance due to the strong coupling of the @xmath0 and @xmath3 channels .",
    "this hadronic model has been quite successful in reproducing the @xmath0 partial - wave amplitudes up to the center - of - mass energy of @xmath28 gev and for the total angular momentum states with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a dynamical coupled - channel model for pseudoscalar meson photoproduction based on a field - theoretical approach of haberzettl @xcite has been introduced in conjunction with the jlich hadronic coupled - channel model .",
    "this photoproduction model is distinguished from the majority of the existing dynamical models by the fact that , in addition to satisfying unitarity and analyticity as a matter of course , it also satisfies the full gauge - invariance condition dictated by the generalized ward - takahashi identity .",
    "by contrast , the vast majority of existing dynamical models satisfy only current conservation but not gauge invariance . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a preliminary feasibility study of this field - theory approach was presented . in the present work ,",
    "we carry out an extended and more quantitative calculation of the neutral and charged pion photoproduction reactions within this approach using the jlich @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "we calculate cross sections as well as the beam asymmetries up to @xmath31 gev .",
    "the full single - meson photoproduction amplitude , @xmath32 , is obtained by attaching a photon everywhere into the dressed @xmath33 vertex , which gives @xcite @xmath34 where the first three terms describe the coupling of the photon to the external legs of the dressed @xmath33 vertex , with the subscripts @xmath18 , @xmath12 and @xmath11 referring to the appropriate mandelstam variables of their respective intermediate hadrons .",
    "the last term @xmath35 is interaction current , where the photon couples inside the @xmath33 vertex . in our work",
    "it is chosen as @xcite @xmath36 , \\label{eq : mint2}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 denotes the transverse part of @xmath38 ; @xmath39 stands for an undetermined transverse contact current taken to be zero in the present work for simplicity ; @xmath40 is the non - polar part of the hadronic scattering amplitude ; @xmath41 describes the free propagation of the intermediate meson - baryon two - body system .",
    "@xmath42 is the generalized contact current as specified in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it accounts for the complicated part of the interaction current which can not be treated explicitly . the amplitude @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for the dressed @xmath46 vertex with @xmath47 denoting either the nucleon or baryon resonance , @xmath48 denotes the dressed baryon propagator .",
    "the dressed hadronic vertices and propagators are determined by the hadron dynamics of the jlich @xmath0 coupled - channel model .",
    "@xmath49 is the full dressed @xmath50 vertex as derived in ref .",
    "differential cross sections for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the solid curves show the results from the full calculation .",
    "the dotted and the dashed curves are obtained by respectively switching off the loop integral or the contact current @xmath42 .",
    "data are from ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "photon spin asymmetries for @xmath54 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the solid curves show the results from the full calculation .",
    "the dotted and the dashed curves are obtained by respectively switching off the loop integral or the contact current @xmath42 .",
    "data are from ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "the parameters of the present pion photoproduction model are determined by fitting the differential cross section and the beam asymmetry data of the charged and neutral pion photoproduction up to @xmath31 gev .",
    "they are listed in ref .",
    "the calculated differential cross sections and beam asymmetries for @xmath55 , @xmath52 and @xmath56 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dsdo ] and [ fig : sa ] , respectively , together with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "more results for differential cross sections and beam asymmetries at 13 additional energies from the @xmath0 threshold up to @xmath31 gev can be found in ref .",
    "figure  [ fig : sig ] shows the total cross sections for the three charged pion photoproduction channels .",
    "note that the total cross - section data have not been included in our fit . in figs .",
    "[ fig : dsdo]-[fig : sig ] , the solid curves correspond to the results of our full calculation , while the dotted and dashed curves are obtained by respectively switching off the loop integral and the contact current @xmath42 in the full amplitude .",
    "one sees that our theoretical results for both the differential cross sections and beam asymmetries ( figs .",
    "[ fig : dsdo ] and [ fig : sa ] ) as well as the total cross sections ( fig .  [ fig : sig ] ) are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "juli - daz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have also performed an investigation of the single - pion photoproduction within the ebac dynamical coupled - channel model .",
    "compared to our model , they included two additional resonances , namely @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; however , the @xmath59 channel was not analyzed in their work . compared with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the agreement of our results with the data is a little bit better for both the @xmath60 and @xmath52 channels .",
    "figures  [ fig : dsdo]-[fig : sig ] also show clearly that the loop integral and the contact current @xmath42 are important for reproducing the data , which means that the coupled - channel effects _ and _ gauge invariance are essential for understanding the single - pion photoproduction reactions . while the importance of coupled - channel effects was pointed out already in ref .",
    "@xcite , we emphasize here that the majority of existing dynamical models of photoproduction reactions are actually not gauge invariant since their amplitudes obey current conservation only .",
    "the latter is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be necessary but not sufficient for maintaining full gauge invariance across all levels of a microscopic description of the photoreaction .",
    "the importance of fulfilling the gauge - invariance condition was also emphasized for the @xmath61 bremsstrahlung reaction @xcite .",
    "total cross sections for @xmath62 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the solid curves show the results from the full calculation . the dotted and",
    "the dashed curves are obtained by respectively switching off the loop integral or the contact current @xmath42 .",
    "data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite but not included in the fit.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    finally , we mention that the residues and pole positions of the full photoproduction amplitude are being evaluated in our model by making an analytic continuation of the amplitudes to complex energy plane .",
