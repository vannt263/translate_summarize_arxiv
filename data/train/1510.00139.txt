    "these topological defects , exotic vortices , e.g. , half - quantized vortices ( hqvs ) or more generally fractional vortices @xcite , can appear in the systems of multicomponent order parameters .",
    "hqvs have been discussed in various area of physics @xcite , and recently they have been observed experimentally in triplet superconductors @xcite , exiton - polariton condensates @xcite , ultracold atomic gas bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , and helium 3 superfluids @xcite . among them",
    "quantized vortices in multicomponent bec are one of the important subjects @xcite .",
    "quantized vortices in cold atomic becs have been studied thoroughly since its experimental realization @xcite .",
    "the recent progress in this subject can be seen in development of the techniques to nucleate the vortices and to detect the real time vortex dynamics .",
    "the group of amherst college demonstrated the observation of real time evolution of a single vortex , a vortex dipole , and a cluster of a few vortices in a single - component bec @xcite .",
    "these experimental observation was compared with the simple intuitive theories of the point vortex approximation , where the vortex motion is described by fundamental equations of the vortex positions and the interaction between point vortices .",
    "two - component becs are a simplest example of the multicomponent condensates and have also attracted much interest to study the novel phenomena not found in a single component bec .",
    "the mass circulation of two - component becs is fractionally quantized when their mass densities are different .",
    "such a quantized vortex in two - component becs has a composite structure , where a vortex core in one component is filled by the density of the other component @xcite .",
    "this vortex structure was created experimentally through coherent interconversion between two components @xcite .",
    "recently , the asymptotic form of the interaction between two hqvs in two - component becs was derived analytically , having the form @xmath0 for hqvs separated by a large distance @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath1-dependence is different from that of the vortex - vortex interaction @xmath2 in a single - component bec @xcite .",
    "since the two components interact only through the density - density coupling , the vortex in one component does not directly feel the circulation of the vortex in the other component .",
    "this fact results in an indirect interaction of the hqvs , where the filling component of each vortex core is affected by the circulation created by the vortex in the same component , dragging the vortex in which it is filled by the intercomponent density - density coupling .",
    "while the vortex interaction in a scalar bec depends on the circulations of each vortex , the interaction for the hqvs does not depend on the sign of the circulation but on the sign and magnitude of the intercomponent coupling .",
    "et al_. studied the equilibrium properties of multi - vortex systems in two - component becs using the above asymptotic form @xcite , and some studies have discussed the vortex - vortex interaction beyond the asymptotic regime @xcite .",
    "a next question naturally arises as how two interacting hqvs behave temporally .",
    "although the real time dynamics of two vortices in two - component becs was studied numerically by hberg and santos @xcite , they considered only particular situations in a harmonically trapped system .",
    "et al . , _ studied the @xmath3-vortex dynamics in multicomponent becs through the variational analysis and the resulting equations of motions for the vortex positions are shown to include the terms of inertial vortex mass @xcite , which are usually neglected in the case of vortex motion in a scalar bec .",
    "in this paper , we study the real time evolution of the two interacting hqvs in homogeneous two - component bec .",
    "we find that depending on not only the vortex interaction but also the signs of circulation of the hqvs , the vortex motions exhibit interesting nontrivial trajectories .",
    "we consider the vortex dynamics for two cases ( i ) one of two vortices is placed in either of the two components and ( ii ) two vortices are placed in the same component . for the case ( i )",
    ", even though the intervortex interaction is independent of the sign of circulation , the dynamical trajectories of two vortices are different for the signs as well as for the intercomponent coupling strength . in the case ( ii ) , the dynamics also has nontrivial dependence on the intercomponent coupling",
    ". the initial stage of the dynamics can be explained by the classical equations of motions for the point vortices , where it is important to take account of the short - range property of the vortex - vortex interaction .",
