    "although they are widely studied , there remain many uncertainties concerning their formation and evolution .",
    "one avenue to constrain this problem is to invoke binary population synthesis .",
    "this allows one to compare the observed numbers and characteristics of these objects with that which are expected given our present understanding of binary evolution and accretion physics .",
    "hydrogen - rich material accreted by a wd from its companion may burn at its surface either stably or unstably .",
    "the result is strongly dependent on the mass transfer rate and mass of the wd @xcite .",
    "if the accretion rate corresponds to the stable nuclear burning regime , accreting white dwarfs ( henceforth , snbwd ) have typical effective temperatures of @xmath5k , emitting prominently in the soft x - ray and euv . in this regime ,",
    "not all accreting wds can be observed as ssss , as this depends on their intrinsic luminosity , effective temperature and the column density of the gas along the line of sight . in the present paper",
    ", we refer to snbwds with observed soft x - ray ( 0.30 - 0.70  kev ) luminosity @xmath6   erg / s as ssss . for accretion rates below the stability limit",
    ", hydrogen burning occurs only in unstable flashes , observable as novae .",
    "there will be little x - ray emission in this regime , except in the post - novae sss phase ( @xcite , soraisam et al .",
    "( in prep . ) ) .",
    "if the accretion rate is larger than the maximum rate for stable nuclear - burning , the result is still unclear @xcite . in the scenario of @xcite ,",
    "the wd will become a red giant after accreting a small amount of mass @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite proposed that in this regime the excess mass is lost as an optically thick wind .",
    "following @xcite , the wds in this regime are dubbed rapidly accreting white dwarfs ( rawds ) . in this scenario ,",
    "an accreting wd s photosphere will expand modestly , lowering their effective temperatures such that they radiate predominantly in the euv .",
    "in addition to the emission from x - ray binaries dominating the x - ray radiation in most galaxies , extended emission in soft x - ray band is widely observed in galaxies of different morphologies .",
    "however , the origin of the extended emission is still unclear .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the emission from accreting wds should be an important component of the unresolved emission .",

    "@xcite demonstrated that accreting wds may provide a significant , or even dominant , contribution to the ionizing background , particularly in early - type galaxies with passively - evolving stellar populations ( those with negligible ongoing star formation ) .",
    "depending on their numbers , this could significantly impact the ionization state of the warm ism in gas - rich early - type galaxies .",

    "morphologically , this gas is found in regular hi discs , rings and irregularly distributed clouds .",
    "most common are hi discs and rings , which may extend to tens of kpc , suggesting a covering factor of @xmath21/2 for the ionizing radiation from the stellar population .    although emission from populations of accreting wds is important , it has been seldom studied . in paper",
    "i @xcite , we conducted a population synthesis study of accreting white dwarfs .",
    "we found that it is important to have a realistic prescription for mass transfer and investigated the number of rawds , snbwds and the sne ia rate in the single degenerate ( sd ) scenario . in this paper , based on the results of our binary population synthesis of paper i , we study the soft x - ray and uv emission of the population of accreting wds and their contribution to the radiation of elliptical galaxies in the he ii 4686@xmath12 and h@xmath13 emission lines .",

    "[ fig : lumx ] that , at the ages exceeding 6 gyr , our predicted x - ray luminosities are comparable to that which are observed in nearby ellipticals , and is roughly two orders of magnitude below the soft x - ray flux expected if all sne ia are produced via the sd scenario ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with our prediction that the sd channel does not significantly contribute to the sn ia rate at late delay times ( see fig . 8 in paper i )",
    "however , for the two youngest galaxies in the @xcite sample , ngc3585 and ngc3377 , our standard calculations predict up to an order of magnitude larger soft x - ray luminosities than observed . the strong dependence of the x - ray luminosity on the age of the stellar population predicted by our calculation seems to contradict observations . in interpreting this result",

    "however , solar abundance is adopted in our calculation .",

    "the metallicity influences the initial - final mass relation for stars , the stable burning limits of accreting wds , and the evolution of mass transfer rates @xcite .",
    "therefore , any strong conclusion based on the example of these two galaxies may be premature . on the other hand , a similar discrepancy was also found in comparing predicted populations of low mass x - ray binaries with observations , based on a larger and different sample of galaxies and age determinations @xcite .      since nuclear - burning white dwarfs are characteristically high temperature sources , the emission from this population will ionize the ism and will have an important influence on the structure of the ionized gas and emission lines of a galaxy . in particular , compared with the single stellar population , accreting wds are likely to emit predominantly beyond the he ii photoionizing limit ( see fig.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "so in this section , we will investigate the h ionizing and he ii ionizing luminosity of accreting , nuclear - burning wds as a binary population .",
    "in addition , we will compute the predicted ratio of two recombination lines produced in the ism , he ii @xmath84686",
    "/ h@xmath13 , and compare this with observations .    in our calculation",
    ", we assumed the binary fraction to be 50% .",
    "it has been suggested that the binary fraction may depend on the binary parameters @xcite .",
    "we neglect this effect , and therefore may slightly underestimate the binary fraction in our calculations . according to its standard definition ,",
    "the binary fraction includes all binary stars , irrespective of their separation and evolutionary state .",
    "our population synthesis calculations keep track of only those binaries in which one of the components is a mass accreting white dwarf .",
    "such mass - transferring binaries are in fact a very small minority in the population ( in terms of the number of systems and total mass ) . in accounting stars in wide binaries",
    "we assume that their emission is similar to the emission of single stars of the same spectral type .",
    "to compute emission of single stars and stars in wide binaries we use the stellar population synthesis code of @xcite , as described below . in computing the normalisation of the stellar emission we use the total mass of stars , ignoring the small fraction ( @xmath45 by mass ) of stars in mass transferring close binaries .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the stars in wide binaries and single stars as single population ( sp ) and accreting , nuclear burning wds as binary population ( bp ) .",
    "the total emission of the entire population is computed as a sum of emission of the sp and bp .",
    "the sp - only model represents the hypothetical case of absence of mass - accreting white dwarfs in the stellar population .    in fig .",

    "this introduces only small inconsistency with our bp calculations ( conducted for the kroupa imf ) .",
    "the chabrier imf has the same exponent as the kroupa imf for stellar masses above 1.0 @xmath27 and a more complicated shape at smaller masses .",
    "if the two imfs are normalised to the same total mass , their high mass ( @xmath46 ) parts have the same shape and only small ( @xmath47 ) difference in normalisation .",
    "this will result in a similarly small difference ( @xmath47 ) in the predicted ionizing luminosity between the two imfs , since stars with initial mass below 1.0 @xmath27 do not contribute to the ionising uv radiation .",
    "such a small difference is insignificant given the large dynamical range of the ionising luminosities plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumhhe ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumhhe ] , we do not show the case of a constant sfr , as in this case the h - ionizing and he - ionizing emission from accreting white dwarfs are significantly smaller than emission from the sp .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the constant sfr case there are many luminous young stars with high effective temperatures , which dominate the ionizing emission .    in the starburst case ,",
    "the h - ionizing emission from the population of accreting wds is comparable to that from the sp in the @xmath48 gyr age range ; it is unimportant for much earlier ages and for old galaxies .",
    "the he - ionizing emission on the contrary is predicted to dominate the ionizing uv background at ages greater than @xmath49 gyr . in the sp model ,",
    "massive stars dominate the ionizing uv radiation at early times . as the galaxy age increases , the main sequence turn - off mass decreases and the effective temperatures of the hottest stars in the population drops .",

    "this is due to the fact that , at early times , the binaries have massive donor stars and higher thermal timescale mass transfer rates .",
    "in contrast , at later times , the donors are less massive and the thermal mass transfer rate is lower , leading to more emission from the snbwds . in the model norawd , the soft x - ray luminosity , h - ionizing luminosity and he - ionizing luminosity are very different from that in model a025 . in paper",
    "i ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , we found that there are two stable burning phases for some accreting wd binaries . in model norawd , replacing the rawd phase with a ce , only the first stably burning phase will contribute to the emission .",

    "there exist several uncertainties in both the initial conditions and the treatment of stellar evolution which may influence the results . in the following , we discuss a ( partial ) list of several aspects which may significantly impact our model , and their viability in providing a solution .",
    "some of the model parameters not considered here were either tested and found to be of minimal importance ( e.g. imf , mass ratio ) , or are simply unlikely to be of significant impact ( e.g. treatment of convective overshooting , as this only matters for massive stars ) .",
    "\\1 ) one important uncertainty is the retention efficiency of accreted matter , ( see @xcite . in our calculation , we assumed that the he burning retention efficiency is 100% , which is clearly an overestimate and results in an excess of massive wds , which may be partially responsible for the high h and he ionizing emission of accreting wds . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "have shown that the conventional assumption that the retention efficiency of matter at the surface of a wd may be computed as a product of independently calculated retentions of h and he ( i.e. @xmath71 ) , results in an underestimate of @xmath72 .",
    "the reason is that h - burning heats the underlying he layer and the outbursts of he - burning are milder than that in the case of accretion of pure he .    .",
    "the `` new '' model a025 is the result computed using the revised he burning retention efficiency ( see text).,width=317 ]    in order to check if he retention efficiency has a strong influence on our result , we recomputed our results with the he burning retention efficiency given in @xcite , and with the range in mass transfer rates corresponding to the stable burning regime as given in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumx_com ] , we compare the soft x - ray luminosity from this new model with that from our standard model , and find the difference is not significant . in spite of this , we should emphasize that the retention efficiency suffers significant uncertainty , requiring further investigation .",
    "therefore , without more precisely understood retention efficiency , we can not completely exclude the influence of this parameter .",
    "\\2 ) in our calculations , solar abundance is adopted . as we discussed in section",
    "[ sec : xray ] , some galaxies in our x - ray comparison are likely to have low metallicities , which plays a complicated and still uncertain role in the evolution of accreting wds . on the one hand , at very low metallicities the stable - burning regime may be extended to much lower mass transfer rates @xcite . however , at the same time low - z wd binaries are expected to have much higher accretion rates @xcite , likely pushing many more binaries into dynamically unstable mass transfer .",
    "either of these mechanisms require very low metallicities ( @xmath73 0.01@xmath74 ) , unlikely to be typical of many of the relatively nearby early - type galaxies used in our study .",
    "therefore , we leave consideration of the evolution of wd binaries at low - z to a future study .",
    "\\3 ) the x - ray comparison is based on a sample of six nearby galaxies ( the only currently available set of measurements suitable for such a comparison ) .",
    "in addition , there is some controversy between different age estimates for the two youngest galaxies .",
    "however , while the incorrect age determination could in principle resolve the discrepancy in the x - ray band , it is unlikely to explain the he  ii  4686  @xmath3 line ratio , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "\\4 ) it may be that our modeling of the emission spectra of nuclear burning white dwarfs is incorrect .",
    "this must involve a failure of the 1d theory , rather than any simple deviations from the black body spectral template used throughout the paper ( see section [ sec : emi ] ) .",
    "one obvious possibility is that the photospheric radii may be much larger than predicted by 1d models of the nuclear burning on the wd surface .",
    "this would shift the peak of their emission to the uv or optical bands where they would be remarkably unusual objects .",
    "however , @xcite searched for such objects in the small magellanic cloud and found no plausible candidates",
    ". therefore this possibility seems to be unlikely .",
    "\\5 ) one of the most important uncertainties in our calculations is the treatment of the ce phase",
    ". there are still many aspects of ce evolution which remain unclear , such as the available energy sources and the definition of the core - envelope boundary ( see @xcite for a review,@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the criteria for the onset of a ce phase also suffer from great uncertainty . in the following subsection",
    ", we will discuss this possibility in depth and provide a possible solution to resolve the discrepancy between our computed results and observations .      in our calculations , for binaries harbouring giant donors",
    ", we adopted after @xcite and @xcite as the criterion for stable mass loss a critical value of mass ratio ( hereafter , hw criterion ) :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the core mass fraction . for conservative mass transfer ,",
    "this predicts dynamical instability for stars with a core mass fraction @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath78",
    ". @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , using detailed binary evolution calculations , found that the critical mass ratio can be up to @xmath79 , depending on the evolutionary phase of the donor star , mass and angular momentum loss from the system .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) found that this difference is due to the existence of a superadiabatic outer surface layer , which plays a critical role during the mass transfer .",
    "following on the work of @xcite , @xcite found that the critical mass ratio varies from 1.5 to 2.2 for conservative mass transfer .",
    "given these recent results , we turn now to considering alternatives to the hw prescription , in particular a more stringent condition for the onset of a ce , as a possible solution to the overproduction of accreting wds found in our standard model above .",
    "we attempt to replace the hw criteria with @xmath80 ( model a025qc15 ) , @xmath81 ( model a025qc17 ) , and @xmath82 ( model a025qc19 ) , for binaries consisting of ms and giant stars .",
    "although the mass ratio needed for the onset of a ce is understood to vary significantly for differing combinations of accretor mass , donor mass , and evolutionary state of the donor , these values are more consistent with the results of detailed numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and much higher than what is typically found when implementing the hw criterion . in this section",
    ", using these new criteria , we calculated the soft x - ray , h - ionizing and he - ionizing luminosity as a function of stellar age .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumx_sol ] , we show the evolution of soft x - ray luminosity as a function of stellar age . compared with our model using the hw criterion ,",
    "the new criteria have larger critical mass ratios . with larger critical mass ratios ,",
    "the predicted soft x - ray luminosity becomes lower .",
    "this is due to the fact that , with the requirement of a larger critical mass ratio , it will be relatively difficult for binaries to enter dynamically unstable mass transfer .",
    "therefore , fewer binaries will enter a ce phase , and fewer accreting wds will form .",
    "for old stellar populations , the predicted soft x - ray luminosities in model a025qc17 and model a025qc19 are lower than the observed values . given that the observational soft x - ray luminosity is the upper limit for the emission of accreting wds , our results are consistent with observations .",
    "[ fig : lumh_sol ] shows the evolution of the h - ionizing and he - ionizing luminosity for different models , respectively .",

    "[ fig : numsss ] . in the starburst case , the sss population peaks around @xmath0  gyr and then declines by @xmath85 orders of magnitude by the age of 10  gyr .",

    "a similar peak was found in earlier studies of sne ia rates in the single degenerate scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reason for this is that main - sequence stars with mass close to @xmath86 have lifetimes @xmath0  gyr and radii and luminosities that enable a relatively long stage of thermal time - scale mass loss with the rate @xmath87/yr , corresponding to the stable hydrogen burning regime ( see figs . 2 and 10 in paper i ) .",
    "the number of ssss for a @xmath88 galaxy at 10 gyr is @xmath89 in the starburst case and @xmath90 in the constant sfr case assuming @xmath91 .",
    "given the high intrinsic absorption of spiral galaxies , we also made a set of calculations assuming @xmath92 .",
    "in this case , the sss number is @xmath93 for a spiral - like galaxy .",
    "note , however , that the observable number of ssss depends on the absorption column density , which in turn depends on the relative distribution of gas and ssss in any given galaxy .",
    "given the hard emission of ssss , it is suggested that they should be accompanied by ionized nebulae . @xcite",
    "modeled the ionization and temperature structure of such nebulae and predicted strong [ oiii ] @xmath85007 and he ii @xmath84686 emission lines .",

    "they found only one sss , cal  83 ( first identified as a high - excitation nebula by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a detected nebula , with null detections among the 9 other known magellanic ssss .",
    "this means that either the time - averaged luminosity and/or temperature of these sources must be much lower than presently observed , or that the local ism density around ssss are typically too low .",
    "in fact , given that typical ism densities are 1  2 orders of magnitude below that observed for the cal 83 nebula , the latter appears more likely ( see woods & gilfanov ( submitted ) , who found a 70% probability that @xmath94 sss in the lmc would have a detectable nebula ) .",
    "the situation is complicated further in the accretion - wind scenario  for ssss in star - forming galaxies , a wind - blown bubble will excavate a cavity in the ism surrounding the source which is 10  40 pc in radius @xcite . consequently , the ionization parameter and morphology of these nebulae will be much different .",
    "since the common morphology of hi gas in elliptical galaxies is a regular hi disk or ring , individual sources are not embedded in the ism they ionize . with the above explanation and hi gas morphology in mind",
    ", we would expect that the individual emission line luminosity in elliptical galaxies should not be influenced by any complications introduced by the impact of the accreting wd on any surrounding ism , as is the case in star - forming galaxies .",
    "based on the results of population synthesis of accreting wds from paper i and using simple assumptions regarding the emission of accreting wds , we study the number of observed ssss , the soft x - ray luminosity of accreting wds , and their h and he  ii ionizing luminosity .",
    "the main conclusions are as follows .    1 .",
    "we compare predictions of our model with observations of nearby elliptical galaxies in optical and x - ray bands . to this end",

    "the he  ii  4686  @xmath3 line ratio from warm ism predicted by our model is consistent with that measured in the stacked sdss spectra of retired galaxies .",
    "however , for stellar ages of @xmath96 gyrs our model significantly over - predicts the soft x - ray luminosity and the he  ii  4686  @xmath3 line ratio .",
    "we discuss various possibilities to explain this controversy and tentatively conclude that the most likely reason is that the classical @xcite criterion typically used for evaluating the onset of dynamically unstable mass transfer for giant stars predicts too low critical mass ratio .",
    "replacement of this criterion by fixed critical mass ratios ( @xmath97 or 1.9 ) , brings the soft x - ray luminosity and line ratio he ii@xmath63 in the new models to consistency with the observations .",
