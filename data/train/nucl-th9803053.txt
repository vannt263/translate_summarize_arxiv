    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is a very important tool for investigating the structure of hadrons@xcite .",
    "it involves the interaction between an energetic lepton beam ( electrons , muons , neutrinos ) and the respective hadron .",
    "dis has been described ( i ) in the framework of the quark parton model ( qpm ) using the light - cone formalism and ( ii ) with the aid of covariant field theories .",
    "the qpm is based on the assumption that all quarks ( before and after scattering ) are on - shell @xcite . in this manner gauge invariance",
    "is built - in .",
    "the leading contribution is the pole ( or born ) term and the rescattering term is negligable in the deep inelastic limit . in descriptions based on covariant field theory ,",
    "however , the intermediate quarks ( or nucleons in studies of the deuteron@xcite ) are off - shell , and hence the pole term can not , by itself , be gauge invariant . in this case",
    "it would appear that the pole term can not be the leading term in the deep inelastic limit , and this has been a problem for covariant theories for many years .    to avoid this problem ,",
    "de forest @xcite replaced the current by its gauge invariant part .",
    "he presented no proof , and the `` de forest prescription '' has always seemed adhoc .",
    "the problem continues to trouble calculations which rely on the use of off - shell particles and dominance of the pole term . in a recent paper",
    "kelly @xcite outlines three alternatives . assuming that the photon has four momentum @xmath0 , these three alternatives can be summarized as follows :    * _ de forest prescription _ :",
    "leave the time component of the current ( the charge ) unchanged , and replace the third component by @xmath1 . * _",
    "weyl prescription _ : leave the third component of the current unchanged , and replace the time component by @xmath2 .",
    "* _ landau prescription _ : replace the four current by @xmath3 ,    where we use the slac convention that @xmath4 for electron scattering .",
    "note that each of these descriptions gives _ a different result for the charge and @xmath5 components_. in the generalized breit frame , where @xmath6 , the de forest and the landau prescriptions are identical .",
    "one of the major conclusions of this paper is a detailed theoretical argument justifying the landau prescription .",
    "in addition to this , we present a simple toy model for the structure functions of a composite system .",
    "the structure functions we obtain from this model exhibit scaling , are dominated in the deep inelastic limit by the `` gauge invariant part '' of the pole term , and give a simple , qualitative description of the distribution function of valence quarks .",
    "we present the results from two versions . in one ,",
    "the particles are taken to be scalars , and the scalar `` nucleon '' is a bound state of a scalar `` quark '' with unit charge and a scalar diquark with no charge . in a second ,",
    "more realistic model , the composite spin 1/2 nucleon is a bound state of a spin 1/2 quark and a scalar diquark .",
    "stimulated by the success of qcd in 1 + 1 dimensions@xcite , we carry out these model calculations in 1 + 1 dimensions , obtaining finite results without the need for model dependent form factors .",
    "the only parameters in the model are the masses of the quark and diquark , @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the 1 + 1 dimensional calculations do not necessarily give the right physics , but help in developing the necessary tools for a more complete treatment .",
    "the remainder of this paper is divided into five sections .",
    "first we present our simple bound state model for the nuclon ( which could also be applied to the description of mesons ) .",
    "then we study gauge invariance and show how to uniquely define the gauge invariant part of the pole term . in sec .",
    "iv we show for scalar quarks that the gauge invariant part of the pole term does indeed dominate dis . the model deep inelastic structure functions are calculated and compared with experiment in sec .",
    "v , and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we begin the discussion by constructing a dynamical model for the nucleon . in the first subsection",
    "we will assume that the scalar `` nucleon '' is a bound state of the two `` fundamental '' scalar particles : a charged `` quark '' @xmath9 of mass @xmath7 and an uncharged `` diquark '' @xmath10 of mass @xmath8 . in the second subsection we will generalize to a charged spin 1/2 quark and a charged spin 1/2 nucleon .",
    "the two `` fundamental '' constituents will interact with each other via the coupling shown in fig .  1 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the coupling strength , and the form factor @xmath13 is a function of the square of the diquark four - momentum .",
    "for generality , we keep these form factors for now , but they will be set to unity later when we carry out calculations in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
