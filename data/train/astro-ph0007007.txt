    "the hot controversy on the trend of the oxygen abundance in very old metal - deficient stars is one of the most interesting topics in the field of stellar spectroscopy as well as galactic chemical evolution .",
    "( see , e.g. , carretta , gratton , & sneden 2000 and references therein for overviewing the current status of this problem . )",
    "the essential point of the argument is , shortly speaking , how the [ o / fe ] ratio behaves itself toward the regime of very low metallicity , say , down to [ fe / h]@xmath4 .",
    "admittedly , it seems to have been almost established that [ o / fe ] increases from @xmath5 ( [ fe / h]@xmath6 ) to @xmath7 ( [ fe / h]@xmath8 ) for stars of disk population .",
    "however , when stars of old halo population are concerned , we are wondering whether [ o / fe ] shows a nearly flat plateau at [ o / fe ] @xmath9 ( `` plateau '' trend ) or it continues to increase steadily up to [ o / fe ] @xmath10 ( `` steady increase '' trend ) , as [ fe / h ] decreases from @xmath8 down to @xmath4 .    from observational point of view",
    ", this problem is closely connected with the technical details of abundance determination ; i , e . , especially important is which of the spectral lines to be adopted . in the present case of late - type stars ,",
    "the candidates of the lines used for o - abundance determination are roughly divided into three groups : + ( 1 ) o  i permitted lines ( e.g. , 77715 triplet ) + ( 2 ) [ o  i ] forbidden lines ( 6300/6363 doublet ) + ( 3 ) oh lines in the uv region of 31003200 @xmath0 + among these the [ o  i ] forbidden lines ( originating from the ground level ) have so far been regarded as being the most reliable abundance indicator because of its low @xmath11 sensitivity along with the certain validity of the lte assumption , in contrast to the high - excitation permitted lines which are @xmath11-sensitive and more or less affected by a non - lte effect .    generally speaking , there seems to have been an implicit consensus that the `` plateau '' trend probably represents the truth , partly because it is suggested from the analysis of [ o  i ] 6300 forbidden line , though with a rather large scatter ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "11 in timmes , woosley , & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , the fact that this `` flat '' behavior is consistent with the trend posed by other @xmath12-elements ( mg , si , ca , ti ) may have substantiated this view .",
    "namely , it is reasonably explainable based on the standard theory of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "that is , a steady enrichment of @xmath12-elements along with fe with a constant @xmath12-to - fe ratio by massive stars via type ii sne ( very short time - scale nearly like instantaneous recycling ) in the earlier phase of galactic evolution , and then later type ia sne ( long time - scale of the order of @xmath13 yr ) begins to explode to eject fe , which must have gradually suppressed [ @xmath12/fe ] eventually down to the current value .    on the other side , the o  i 77715 lines were known to imply the `` steady increase '' trend ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 in bessell , sutherland , & ruan 1991 , or fig . 4 in mishenina et al . 2000 ) , which means that these permitted lines yield higher abundance than that resulted from the forbidden line .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that this tendency has not been taken too seriously compared to the [ o  i ] results for the uneasy problems involved with these lines mentioned above .",
    "recently , however , israelian , garca lpez , & rebolo ( 1998 ) and boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported that [ o / fe ] clearly increases from @xmath1 + 0.6 to @xmath1 + 1.0 as [ fe / h ] varies from @xmath1 @xmath2 to @xmath14 ( just similar to what had been implied by 77715 permitted lines ) based on their new independent analyses of numerous oh lines in uv , which have sufficient strengths even in extremely metal - poor stars and thus suitable for abundance determination .",
    "this `` steady increase '' trend has thus acquired a special attention as the true [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation , though this must be quite embarrassing for theoreticians ( i.e. , theoretical interpretation becomes much harder ) .",
    "even so , the problem is still far from being settled , unfortunately .",
    "a strong criticism was successively addressed by fulbright & kraft ( 1999 ) , who reinvestigated the atmospheric parameters of two extremely metal - poor stars sudied by israelian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and showed that their large [ o / fe ] values ( @xmath10 ) can be considerably reduced down to @xmath9 if the [ o  i ] 6300 line was used , concluding that it is still premature to accept their oh results .",
    "so we are in a quite confusing situation .",
    "which line gives the correct oxygen abundance ?",
    "[ o  i ] forbidden line ? o  i permitted lines ( which yield the same trend as that given by oh lines ) ?",
    "this topic attracted our attention , since we once confirmed that the oxygen abundances derived from o  i 77715 lines and [ o  i ] 6300 line do not show any systematic discordance from the analysis of population i g  k giants ( takeda , kawanomoto , & sadakane 1998a ) .",
    "consequently , we decided to conduct a detailed analysis of selected seven very metal - deficient stars ( @xmath14 @xmath15 [ fe / h ] @xmath15 @xmath2 ) based on the high - quality spectra observed with keck hires , in an attempt to compare the abundances of oxygen derived from the permitted o  i lines ( 77715 , 8446 ) and forbidden [ o  i ] lines ( 6363 , 6300 ) with each other , as well as to settle which of the [ o / fe ] trend is more likely .",
    "we will show later that the former `` permitted '' o  i lines are probably a more reliable abundance indicator rather than the forbidden [ o  i ] lines , lending support for the `` steadily increasing '' trend of [ o / fe ] .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out for six hd - numbered very metal - deficient stars ( five g  k giants and one turn - off star in the metallicity range of @xmath14 @xmath15 [ fe / h ] @xmath15 @xmath2 ) in the seasons of 1997 may and 1999 november using the high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ; vogt 1994 ) of the keck i telescope .",
    "basic observational data of the program stars are given in table 1 .",
    "the data were reduced with the hires automated reduction ( har ) software package developed by t. a. barlow .",
    "this package converts the two - dimensional echelle raw data to one - dimensional wavelength - calibrated spectrum of each order with full processings of bias subtraction , flat fielding , cosmic - ray correction , sky subtraction , and dispersion correction .",
    "the multiple calibrated spectra were coadded using the iraf package _ scombine _ and then normalized to continuum level of unity using the iraf package _ continuum _ for 1997 may data and the har package _",
    "xplot _ for 1999 november data .",
    "the wavelength range of the spectrum is 6330 @xmath0 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath15 8760 @xmath0 , which comprises the lines of [ o  i ] 6363 , o  i 77715 , and o  i 8446 . since we tried to cover the long - wavelength range up to 8760 @xmath0 ( because of our intention of observing special spectral lines such as those of sulfur ) , we were obliged to set the short - wavelength limit at 6330 @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , we had to abandon using the [ o  i ] 6300 line .      regarding cs 22892 - 052 , the well - known carbon - rich very metal - poor star with excesses of neutron - capture elements ( cf .",
    "sneden et al .",
    "1994 ) , we used the keck hires spectrum which was kindly reduced and provided by m. kuchner ( private communication ) covering the wavelength range of 5340@xmath0 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath15 7770 @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , the signal - to - noise ratio of this spectrum is considerably poor ( 120140 ) compared to those of other six stars . since the long - wavelength limit is just on the position of o  i 77715 triplet , only the shortest - wavelength component ( at 7771.94 @xmath0 ) of the three",
    "could be used .",
    "note also that the [ o  i ] 6300 line was usable in addition to [ o  i ] 6363 , while the o  i 8446 line is not included in this spectrum .",
    "the identification of spectral lines , the selection of blend - free lines usable for abundance determination , and the evaluation of equivalent widths by gassian fitting ( or by direct integration if necessary ) were carried out with the help of the interactive gui software `` spshow '' , which was developed by y. takeda based on kurucz s atlas / width code as a multi - purpose tool for stellar spectrum analysis ( e.g. , synthesizing a theoretical spectrum with any abundance / line - broadening , browsing of observed spectrum to be overplotted , radial - velocity correction by fitting with an appropriate horizontal shift , interactive abundance - determination , equivalent - width measurement , etc . )",
    "we measured the equivalent width for all spectral lines as possible ( irrespective of the species ) as far as being confidently identified and free from blending with other lines .",
    "these data were further used for abundance determination as described in  3.2 .",
    "we used kurucz s ( 1993 ) atlas9 line - blanketed model atmospheres , based on which the atmospheric models of individual stars were constructed by interpolation in terms of @xmath11 , @xmath17 , and [ x ] ( metallicity ) .    regarding the choice of these parameters",

    "we then computed the @xmath17 values from @xmath23 ( bolometric luminosity ) , which were derived from hipparcos data with the bolometric correction estimated from kurucz s ( 1993 ) theoretical colors , while using the adopted @xmath11 and assuming 0.8 @xmath24 ( pilachowski et al .",

    "we then determined the abundances of various elements ( apart from c and o which were treated specially ) from the measured equivalent - widths of spectral lines , with the corresponding atmospheric model and the microturbulent velocity .",
    "the resulting abundances averaged over each of the lines are presented in table 2 . in case where lines of two ionization stages were available , we took their simple mean .    although the detailed data and results for each line ( e.g. , the equivalent width , the @xmath27 value , and the abundance , etc . )",

    "then , the final oxygen abundance to be adopted was derived by finding the consistent solution based on these two .",

    "the abundances from these well - known high - excitation o  i triplet lines ( rmt no.1 ; @xmath34 = 9.15 ev ) in the quintet system ( @xmath35  @xmath36 ) were derived from their equivalent widths .",

    "the fe abundance was simultaneously determined along with that of o as far as possible ; otherwise , an appropriate value of the fe abundance corresponding to the metallicity was assigned and fixed .",

    "the theoretically synthesized spectra computed with @xmath38 are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we adopted kurucz s ( 1995 ) @xmath27 value for the [ o  i ] forbidden lines ( @xmath47  @xmath48 ) ; i.e. , @xmath49 = @xmath50 for [ o  i ] 6300.30 ( @xmath34 = 0.00 ev ) and @xmath51 for [ o  i ] 6363.78 ( @xmath34 = 0.02 ev ) , though the former was usable only for cs 22892 - 052 . the abundance results are given in table 3 , while the theoretical spectra corresponding to @xmath38 are shown in figure 3 .",
    "note that the abundances for cs 22892 - 052 ( 6363 and 6300 lines ) and hd 184266 ( 6363 line ) are uncertain , because of the difficulty in measuring their equivalent widths accurately ( i.e. , line profiles of these lines are not well defined ) .",
    "before discussing the trend of the oxygen abundance , it may be worth paying attention to hd 184266 , which shows markedly stronger o  i lines ( 77715 , 8446 ) than any other star , in contrast to the remarkable weakness of [ o  i ] 6363 exhibiting a rather ambiguous profile .",
    "as mentioned in  3.3.3 , the abundances derived from three components of the o  i 77715 turned out to be discordant with each other when the microturbulent velocity of 2.2 @xmath40(based on fe  i lines ) was used ( cf .",
    "table 3 ) .",
    "the consistency can be accomplished only when this turbulence parameter is considerably raised up to @xmath1 5 @xmath40 .",
    "we point out that this is very similar to the situation experienced by takeda & sadakane ( 1997 ) in their analysis of population ii horizontal - branch star hd 161817 ( cf .",
    " 6.1 therein ) , in which they attributed this discrepancy to the depth - dependence of the turbulent velocity field increasing with atmospheric height    in fact , similar tomography on @xmath39 as was done by takeda & sadakane ( 1997 ) revealed that two groups of fe  i lines of different @xmath34 ( lower excitation potential ) lead to discrepant values for the @xmath39 value of hd 184266 ; i.e. , 2.3 @xmath40  with @xmath52 ( 0 ev @xmath53 4 ev ) and 1.8 @xmath40  with @xmath54 ( 4 ev @xmath55 ) , indicating a tendency of upward - increasing turbulence . that such a similar phenomenon takes place in the atmosphere of both stars becomes even convincing when we recall hd 184266",
    "is considered to be a horizontal - branch star ( i.e. , just same as hd 161817 ) as judged from its position in the hr diagram ( cf .",
    "fig . 3 in pilachowski et al .",
    "hence we may state that the atmospheric turbulent velocity field in these horizontal - branch stars grows with an increase in height , significantly affecting the strength of such high - excitation o  i lines , because they become fairly strong due to relatively high @xmath11 and tend to form higher in the atmosphere .",
    "it is not clear whether such a phenomenon has something to do with the metal - deficiency .",
    "yet , the recent work by gadun & ploner ( 1999 ) is interesting in this connection , since their calculation indicates that a decrease in metallicity causes the following effects in stellar atmospheres .",
    "+  a growth of granulation contrast .",
    "+  a growth of atmospheric oscillation .",
    "+  an increase of temperature variation in the upper photosphere .",
    "+  size of granules tends to shift toward smaller scales .",
    "+ accordingly , we had better pay attention to the treatment of turbulent velocity fields in the atmosphere of metal - poor stars more seriously , at least when saturated lines are concerned .",
    "we now discuss the main topic of this paper ; i.e. , comparison of the oxygen abundances derived from different lines .",
    "as can be seen from figure 4 , the abundances derived from both permitted line features of high excitation ( o  i 77715 and o  i 8446 ) are in remarkable agreement with each other , which can be also intuitively confirmed from figure 2 .",
    "this means that these two abundances may be regarded as being essentially equivalent , and that o  i ( + fe  i ) 8446 is practically usable for oxygen abundance determination supplementing o  i 77715 .    on the other hand , the case of the forbidden line ( [ o  i ] 6363 or 6300 ) is more complicated .",
    "what we notice from figure 4 is the large scatter in the 6363(6300 ) vs 7773 correlation .",
    "more precisely , while a good agreement is observed for hd 165195 and hd 175305 , the forbidden [ o  i ] line tends to yield lower abundance ( typically by 0.30.4 dex ) than those determined from the permitted o  i lines for other stars .    according to table 3 , if the @xmath11 of the model atmosphere were increased ( say , by @xmath56 k ) , it would be possible to bring them into consistency , while the the effect of changing @xmath17 acts in the same direction for both o  i and [ o  i ] lines .",
    "yet , we would consider it rather unlikely that the @xmath11 values of our model atmospheres are correct for some stars on the one hand but not for others on the other , since our adopted @xmath11 scale is based on a consistent system of pilachowski et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( cf . ",
    "hence , we regard this discrepancy as being real , in the sense that it is unlikely to be attributed to any systematic error in abundance determination . accordingly , in contrast to population i g  k giants where the abundances from o  i 7773 lines and [ o  i ] 6300 do not show any systematic discordance ( takeda et al .",
    "1998a ) , it may be stated that `` _ metal - poor population ii _ g  k giants tend to exhibit abundance discrepancy between these two o  i and [ o  i ] lines , though this does not necessarily always happen ( i.e. , there are surely cases where the consistency is achieved ) . ''      the resulting [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] correlation for o  i 77715 and [ o  i ] 6363(6300 ) is depicted in figure 5 , where israelian et al.s ( 1998 ) results based on the oh lines are also shown for comparison .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the [ o / fe ] values from o  i 77715 lines are reasonably consistent with the oh results showing a `` steady increase '' trend , while those from [ o  i ] forbidden lines tend to lie below the o  i or oh plots by several tenths dex _ with a considerably large scatter_. in any case , we have reconfirmed the observational disagreement between the [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation derived from o  i and [ o  i ] lines mentioned in  1 .    then , which represents the truth ?",
    "we have a preference for the o  i permitted lines ( 77715/8446 ) , because they show a clean trend consistent with that exhibited by oh lines .",
    "the large diversity of the [ o / fe ] values indicated by [ o  i ] lines gives us a feeling that these forbidden lines may be unreliable .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation for metal - poor stars has the `` steady increase '' trend , based on our permitted o  i lines ( 77115/8446 ) analysis , lending support for the oh results reported by israelian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and boesgaard et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "turning our attention to other recent works , we note that mishenina et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also arrived at the same conclusion as ours based on their non - lte analysis of the permitted o  i 77715 triplet , as suggested by previous works ( cf .",
    " 1 ) . however , there are reports that even the permitted o  i lines yield the `` flat''-like trend similarly to [ o  i ] lines ( e.g. , carretta et al . 2000 ; fig . 1 in gustafsson 1999 ) .",
    "the reason for this discordance is not clear ; further observational work on a much larger sample of very metal - poor stars and analysis in a fairly consistent system will be needed until this confusion is finally settled .",
    "our choice ( for the preference of o  i and oh lines ) naturally means that the abundances from [ o  i ] lines tend to be erroneously underestimated for some reasons . what has happened to these forbidden lines ?",
    "we suspect that this line may often suffer with an appreciable weakening in a non - classical way . as a matter of fact",
    ", the possibility of such a weakening was once remarked by langer ( 1991 ) , who proposed a model that the absorption trough of the low - excitation [ o  i ] forbidden line may be filled with the [ o  i ] emission from the surrounding nebulosity , thus leading to a weakening of the line . in this connection , it is interesting to refer to the [ o  i ] 6363 line of hd 184266 , which shows a large o  i vs. [ o  i ] discordance amounting to @xmath1 0.5 dex ( cf . table 3 ) .",
    "let us pay attention to figure 3 , where we notice that the line profile of the [ o  i ] 6363 line is rather complex and a kind of emission - like feature appears to exist ( though not definite ) .",
    "could it be an emission from the surrounding nebulosity , which , for example , was formed by mass ejection at the rgb phase in the past ( recall that this is a horizontal - branch star ) ?",
    "unfortunately , this line is too weak to make a definite argument even with this high s / n ratio , and it is also probable that what we see is nothing but noises . at any rate",
    ", we consider that langer s",
    "( 1991 ) mechanism may be worth further investigation .",
    "such a dilution mechanism due to emission lines ( if any exists ) should be relatively more important for cases where the strength of the [ o  i ] absorption line is intrinsically weak ( i.e. , more efficient for metal - poor case ) , which might explain the reason why the discordance is observed only in population ii stars ( but not in population i ) .",
    "in addition , we should not forget the possibility that the effect of atmospheric inhomogeneity may cause appreciable descrepancies of abundances derived from different lines when analyzed classically , which can be tackled only by detailed realistic ( 2d or 3d ) modeling of the atmosphere of metal - poor stars ( e.g. , asplund et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that [ o / fe ] steadily increases from @xmath1 + 0.6 to @xmath1 + 1.0 as the metallicity becomes lower from [ fe / h ] @xmath57 down to [ fe / h ] @xmath4 .    frankly speaking , however , this must be a rather embarrasing trend hard to interpret for theoreticians who are constructing models of galactic nucleosynthesis history , because other @xmath12-elements ( mg , si , ca , ti ) , which are believed to form in massive stars and ejected by type ii sne explosion like oxygen , generally show more or less the trend of flat `` plateau '' ( i.e. , [ @xmath12/fe ] @xmath1 0.5 at [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ; cf .",
    "fig . 2 in ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ) .",
    "this can be confirmed also from the results of mg , si , ca , and ti derived for our program stars ( cf .",
    "table 2 ) .",
    "this would imply that some kind of unusual enrichment ( e.g. , pre - galactic origin , or by supermassive stars ) may have taken place for oxygen ( while not for mg , si , ca , and ti ) at the very early phase of the galaxy , which would have caused an exceptionally large [ o / fe ] ratio at the old time of very low metallicity , though we are not qualified to state about wherether such a complicated modeling is possible or not .    finally , we make one interesting remark concerning sulfur , another @xmath12-element which has not been well studied so far . according to our results given in table 2 , which were determined from only one s  i line at 8694.63 @xmath0 , the [ s / fe ] ratio shows a steeply increasing trend ( from [ s / fe ] @xmath1 + 0.3 at [ fe / h ] @xmath57 to [ s / fe ] @xmath1 + 1.1 at [ fe / h ] @xmath58 ) , which is similar to the tendency of [ o / fe ] but not to that of [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] .",
    "although this kind of behavior for [ s / fe ] ( as well as for [ o / fe ] ) is not consistent with the current theoretical prediction ( e.g. , timmes et al . 1995 ) , their similarity may be worth attention , which might be a key to understanding the difference between these two groups of @xmath12-elements .",
    "more detailed analysis and discussion on s will be published in a separate paper ( takada - hidai et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we determined the oxygen abundance ( along with the abundances of other elements ) by a detailed non - lte analysis for selected seven very metal - poor stars of 1/30 @xmath1 1/1000 solar metallicity , based on the high - s / n spectra ( in the red through near - ir region ) observed with keck hires , in order to study whether any significant systematic difference exist between the abundances derived from high - excitation o  i permitted lines ( 77715 , 8446 ) and those from low - excitation [ o  i ] forbidden lines ( 6363 , 6300 ) .    the relatively hot ( @xmath11 = 5600 k ) horizontal - branch star hd 184266 turned out to be an interesting object , which shows markedly stronger o  i permitted lines ( 77715 , 8446 ) and very weak [ o  i ] forbidden lines ( 6363 , 6300 ) .",
    "it revealed that the microturbulent velocity dispersion increases with height in the atmosphere of this star : this implies that one should take care about the choice of microturbulence in determining the abundance from saturated lines such as those permitted o  i lines . since the rather complex profile of [ o  i ]",
    "6363 line might be a sign of emission component ( though not definite ) , langer s ( 1991 ) hypothesis ( diluton due to the `` filled - in '' emission from the circumstellar nebulosity ) may deserve special attention as a possible weakening mechanism for this forbidden line .",
    "we found that the both o  i 77715 and o",
    "i 8446 yield quite consistent abundances with each other . on the other hand , the abundance determined from [ o  i ] 6363 ( or 6300 ) is generally lower typically by a few tenths dex than that derived from o  i permitted lines , though the extent of the difference varies from star to star ( two stars show a reasonable consistency ) .",
    "the resulting [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation based on the permitted o  i 77715 triplet shows a tight and clear tendency that [ o / fe ] increases steadily from @xmath1 + 0.6 to @xmath1 + 1.0 as [ fe / h ] decreases from @xmath57 down to @xmath4 , which is quite similar to the trend found by the recent analyses of oh lines in uv ( israelian et al .",
    "1998 ; boesgaard et al .",
    "on the other hand , the [ o / fe ] values derived from [ o  i ] lines , which tend to be lower than the results of o  i permitted lines by @xmath1 0.3 dex on the average , show a large diversity and considered to be unreliable compared to what was suggested from permitted o  i lines .",
    "consequently , we would conclude that the most probable [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation at the very metal - deficient regime is the `` steady increase '' trend implied by o  i permitted lines and oh lines in uv .",
    "we suspect that the [ o  i ] forbidden lines tend to suffer with some kind of weakening , yielding an underestimated abundance , which becomes appreciable only in population ii metal - poor stars .",
    "thus , according to our opinion , its use for abundance determination is questionable , in contrast to the general belief .",
    "all what we can state about the possible weakening mechanism is only speculative .",
    "its cause might exist outer than the photosphere ( e.g. , nebulosity emission ) ; alternatively , the photosphere itself might be responsible for the weakening ( e.g. , atmospheric inhomogeneity ) .",
    "the [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] trend concluded in this paper can not be explained by the standard scenario of galactic chemical evolution , since this does not conform to the tendency suggested from other well - studied @xmath12-elements such as mg , si , ca , and ti . according to the by - product of this study , however , sulfur ( another @xmath12 element ) revealed an interesting behavior , in the sense that [ s / fe ] shows a similar tendency to [ o / fe ] .",
    "we hope that this observational implication will inspire the motivation of theoreticians toward a construction of better and realitic modeling of galactic chemical evolution .",
