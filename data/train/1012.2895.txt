    "exchange bias ( eb ) is an ubiquitous magnetic phenomenon that usually appears when two different magnetic media are in contact .",
    "although eb can be observed in a large variety of non - homogeneous magnetic materials @xcite , in this work we will focus on the case of a bilayer system composed of two films , one ferromagnetic ( fm ) and the other antiferromagnetic ( afm ) .    assuming that the curie temperature @xmath5 of the ferromagnetic material is larger than the nel temperature @xmath6 of the antiferromagnetic one , and that the two films are magnetically coupled by exchange interactions , an unusual hysteresis phenomenon can be observed .",
    "if such a system is cooled down below @xmath6 in the presence of an external applied magnetic field @xmath7 the hysteresis loops of the fm material evidences three important anomalies when compared with the loop of the single ferromagnetic film .",
    "first , a shift in the loop appears , characterized by a new center called the bias field @xmath4 .",
    "this shift is due to the unidirectional anisotropy induced at the interface .",
    "second , the width of the loop usually increases .",
    "finally , the loop also loses its symmetry . as temperature increases",
    ", the bias field @xmath4 goes to zero at certain blocking temperature @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , restoring the normal hysteresis loop of the isolated ferromagnet .",
    "although this phenomenon was reported for the first time in 1956 @xcite and despite the huge theoretical and experimental effort devoted to understanding its origins , there are still many controversial points concerning the underlying mechanisms responsible for such unusual hysteresis anomalies @xcite . in particular , these controversies are in part related to the fact that eb has been observed in a great diversity of magnetic system , including for instance spin glasses , intrinsic inhomogeneous and nanoparticle systems , as well as the bilayered system analyzed in this paper . beyond the theoretical interest ,",
    "this phenomenon is also relevant because of its technological applications  for instance , in the design of magnetic sensor and magnetic recording media devices @xcite , among many others .",
    "as regards the case of a bilayered fm / afm system , the spin structure at the interfacial planes is a main issue in developing the understanding of the eb phenomenon .",
    "in particular , afm interfaces can be roughly classified as _ compensated _ or _ uncompensated _ , depending on whether the nearest afm plane parallel to the interface have zero net magnetization or not , respectively .",
    "most of the earlier models that explain eb assume an uncompensated interfacial spin structure @xcite , even when this requirement is not always fulfilled in experiments .",
    "actually , eb can be observed also in compensated interfaces , but in this case the existence of uncompensated domains has shown to be fundamental for the appearance of the hysteresis shift @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fully uncompensated interfaces can manifest a weaker eb field when compared with partially uncompensated or even compensated interfaces .",
    "in fact , experiments carried out by moran _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite and nogus _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on fe films grown over fef@xmath2 single crystals cut along different orientations , showed that @xmath4 is larger when the interface is compensated ( ( 110 ) plane ) in comparison with the uncompensated case ( ( 010 ) plane ) .",
    "this effect is supposed to be associated with spin re - arrangement at the interface @xcite since a similar behavior was found when the afm is a single crystals or a thin film .    a key point for",
    "the understanding of the eb phenomenon on uncompensated interfaces is the effect of the variation of the exchange coupling between interface layers on the eb field .",
    "while it is difficult to control this quantity at the experimental level , this problem can be handled easily using monte carlo simulations based on microscopic models .",
    "in addition , this methodology allows a detailed description of the interfacial spin structure together with the incorporation of thermal fluctuations , which are relevant for the stability and therefore the appearance of the eb phenomenon .",
    "for instance , thermal effects are necessary to explain the widening of the hysteresis loop close to the blocking temperature @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "numerical studies at the micromagnetic @xcite and monte carlo simulations levels @xcite have proved to be very useful tools for modeling realistic systems . on the other hand , the continuous approximation assumed in micromagnetic based model breaks down in highly anisotropic materials like fef@xmath2 antiferromagnetic compounds .",
    "discretization could give rise to different energy barriers with the consequent thermal activated effects @xcite .",
    "hence , atomic scale based models could be crucial for getting an appropriated description of the magnetic properties .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the eb phenomenon in a fm  afm bilayer system with an uncompensated interface . in section [ background ]",
    "we summarize the existing theoretical background , discussing the phenomenology of eb system in the frame of two of the most relevant models . in section [ simulations ]",
    "we introduce a microscopic model for the bilayered system , describe the simulation protocol and show our numerical results . in order to interpret the results of the previous section we introduce in section [ model ] a generalization of meiklejohn - bean model , which allowed us to analyze the role of the afm layers in the eb phenomenon . in section [ conclu ]",
    "we summarize and discuss the results .",
    "in order to analyze the role of the strength of the interface exchange interaction @xmath3 in the behavior of bias field @xmath10 , let us discuss first the following question : what happens with the order of the afm as we invert the orientation of the fm magnetization by applying an opposite magnetic field @xmath11 ?",
    "we assume that the system has already reached thermal equilibrium at certain temperature @xmath12 below @xmath8 , in such a way that , if @xmath3 were zero , both films would have achieved an ordered state .",
    "since @xmath13 , we assume @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the exchange interactions of the fm and afm , respectively . if @xmath3 is small enough ( @xmath17 ) the spins in the afm will remain almost insensitive to the rotation of the global magnetization of the fm film . in this case the meiklejohn - bean model @xcite predicts a linear dependency of the bias field @xmath10 on the value of @xmath3 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the thickness of the fm film .    at the other extreme ,",
    "when @xmath3 is large enough , the rotation of the magnetization would induce the creation of a domain wall ( parallel to the interface ) in the afm films , at least for small enough values of @xmath20 .",
    "once a perfect domain wall has been formed , any increase of @xmath3 will not alter the value @xmath10 .",
    "this phenomenology is captured by the model of mauri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( from now on the msbk - model ) when the anisotropy of the fm film is negligible .",
    "this model predicts an initial increase of @xmath10 with @xmath3 for small values of @xmath3 , followed by a saturation for large enough values of @xmath3 at @xmath21 where @xmath20 is the anisotropy constant of the afm and @xmath22 is constant depending on the lattice structure .",
    "the previous results suggest a monotonous behavior of the bias field when the anisotropy of the fm film is negligible , with a linear dependence of @xmath10 with @xmath3 for small values of @xmath3 and a saturation for large values of it .",
    "as we will show in the next section , such scenario can change substantially depending on the effective anisotropy of the afm film .",
    "we considered a fm film mounted over an afm film as depicted in figure [ fig1]a .",
    "the films are magnetically coupled to each other by exchange interactions and the structure of both films is either @xmath1 or @xmath0 , assuming a perfect match across the fm / afm interface .",
    "the system is ruled by the following hamiltonian , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a classical heisenberg spin ( @xmath25 ) located at the node @xmath26 of the lattice .",
    "@xmath27 denotes a sum over nearest - neighbors pairs of spins , @xmath28 is the exchange constant of the fm and @xmath29 is the strength of the afm exchange interactions which explicitly depends on the vector @xmath30 .",
    "this dependency of @xmath31 on @xmath32 is introduced in order to set an uncompensated interface at the afm .",
    "for the bcc lattice we set @xmath33 with @xmath34 for all pairs @xmath35 , while for the sc lattice we set @xmath36 if @xmath35 belong to the same plane parallel to the interface and @xmath33 otherwise ( see figure [ fig1]b ) .",

    "we set the following dimensions for the system , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and fix the following parameters : @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is an arbitrary parameter that sets the energy units .",

    "these loops were obtained at @xmath66 , just before the drastic drops observed for @xmath10 in fig.[fig2 ] , where the exchange bias effect is more pronounced and the cycles are still almost reversible .    in figs.[fig3]a and [ fig3]b",

    "we do not observe any trace of coercivity in the simulations .",
    "note that for both structures , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the blocking temperature decreases with the interfacial interaction strength , indicating that the energy barrier for de - pinning the partial domain wall decreases as the wall approaches to a @xmath81 domain wall .",

    "hence , both calculations were carried out keeping @xmath84 constant . in fig.[fig6 ] we plot @xmath85 as a function of @xmath59 for high and low values of @xmath86 . for large enough values of the anisotropy the previous conjecture",
    "is verified , namely , the only effect of changing the lattice structure is a rescaling of the bias field and the effective anisotropy . for small values of the anisotropy such scaling",
    "is observed as long as no hysteresis effects appear , namely , for small enough values of the coupling @xmath59 . for large values of @xmath59",
    "the bias field exhibits only a small drop and it saturates at a constant value in the @xmath1 lattice , but it drops to zero in the @xmath0 case .",
    "we observed that such large drop is due to the depinning of the quasi - domain wall , i.e. to a complete reversion of the staggered magnetization at the afm film .",
    "this effect is not observed in the @xmath1 lattice ( at least for the range of parameter values analyzed here ) .",
    "it is due to a reduction in the in plane magnetization component at the afm layers , associated with a canting of the spins which enhance the pinning of the wall .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the behavior of the bias field is strongly determined by the magnetization dynamics of the atomic layers close to the interface .",
    "moreover , we observed that , for reasonably large values of the anisotropy the spins in each layer rotate almost coherently under the application of an external field parallel to the interface . on the basis of these observations",
    ", we introduced a generalization of meiklejohn - bean @xcite model that explicitly includes the contribution of the afm layers close to the interface .",

    "are assumed to be unit vectors parallel to the interface .",
    "the magnetization per unit area of the whole fm film is then given by @xmath91 ( with @xmath19 the fm film thickness ) , since we are assuming a coherent rotation of the whole fm film .",
    "the n - th layer is the closest one to the interface .",
    "we assume that the applied field @xmath92 is parallel to the interface and only interacts with the fm film .",
    "this approximation is valid as far as the applied field is small enough compared with the molecular field of the afm .",
    "finally , we consider the anisotropy of the afm to be much larger than the fm one , so the latter can be neglected .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is then given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) for the @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) lattice and @xmath95 is the average equilibrium magnetization per unit area of one layer in the afm bulk , assumed to be parallel to the easy axis .",
    "the @xmath96 factor in the second term of eq.([hn ] ) ensures the correct equilibrium configuration at zero temperature and magnetic field with the @xmath97 afm spin aligned with the fm spin .",
    "the model is then equivalent to a @xmath98-spin chain , where the first spin in the chain is subjected to a local effective field produced by the ordering in the afm bulk , while the spin located at the end of the chain ( @xmath88 ) represents the fm film which interacts with an external magnetic field and is ferromagnetically coupled to the @xmath99 afm spin .    at @xmath100 the sublattice magnetization in the bulk",

    "[ fig10 ] , where we compare the maximum bias field @xmath153 and the minimum after the drop @xmath154 ( see fig.[fig8 ] ) with the bias field predicted by msbk model @xmath155 .",
    "the vertical dotted lines divide the graph in three regions of qualitatively different behavior .",
    "the region of validity of the present model ( @xmath156 ) is marked as iii . in this region",
    "a quasi - domain wall forms and , unlike for the continuous approximation where the internal domain wall spins change their orientation in a reversible way , now these spins can have an irreversible or hysteretical behavior , like when defects are present in the afm @xcite .",
    "reduced bias fields @xmath157 and @xmath158 as a function of the reduced anisotropy @xmath159 .",
    "the dashed line is given by the msbk - model ( @xmath155 ) ]    in region i the continuous approach assumed in the msbk - model is valid .",
    "in region ii neither the present model nor msbk model are expected to be valid , since the micromagnetic approach fails because the magnetization profile is no smooth in the atomic scale , but more than one interfacial plane is involved in the magnetization process at the interface .",
    "moreover , we have seen from the monte carlo simulations that in this region lattice structure effects can be very important . at the crossover point @xmath160",
    "we see that @xmath161 , i.e. , hysteresis disappears as expected .",
    "it is worth noting that size effects in the afm become relevant only in regions i and ii , in particular when the thickness of the afm is comparable to the domain wall size . let us analyze thermal effects in the bias field when the afm domain wall is pinned i.e. , it is not able to propagate in the bulk of the afm material .",
    "suppose that the rate of variation of the field is small enough so that the system can be assumed at thermodynamical equilibrium at every step of the loop .",
    "then , the equilibrium behavior can be obtained by computing the partition function @xmath162 where we have taken @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath106 are the angles with respect to the @xmath39 axis of the @xmath166 afm and the fm spins respectively and @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "we assumed that the bulk afm magnetization per layer is given by the mean field approximation @xcite , namely    @xmath169    where @xmath170 is the langevin function and @xmath171 is the number of nearest neighbors which depends of the lattice structure @xmath172 for the @xmath173 .",
    "the last integral in eq .",
    "( [ zn ] ) can be easily solved obtaining the general expression ( aside from an irrelevant multiplicative factor ) : @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the modified bessel function and @xmath176 .",
    "the average magnetization in fm layer can be obtained as @xmath177 and the magnetization at the @xmath178 afm layer , @xmath179 can be computed in a similar way .",
    "solving numerically the previous equations as function of the applied field and temperature we obtained the dependency of the bias field on temperature .",
    "we considered the cases @xmath102 and @xmath180 .",
    "no qualitative differences were observed .",
    "we present here the results for @xmath102 , which are adequate for illustrating the general behavior .",
    "reduced bias field @xmath181 _ vs. _ @xmath59 for different values of @xmath159 .",
    "full lines : equilibrium curves for @xmath102 at @xmath182 .",
    "dotted lines : @xmath183.,width=302 ]    in fig.[fig11 ] we compare the equilibrium reduced bias field @xmath181 as function of @xmath59 at low temperatures ( full lines ) with the zero temperature curves obtained from eq.([eq4 ] ) ( dotted lines ) for several anisotropy values .",
    "one can see that for low interfacial interaction strength @xmath136 the temperature has little effect on the bias field . in both cases an increase in the anisotropy enlarge the range of the linear behavior expected in the strong anisotropy limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . this can be easily understood if we recall that in this regime the system behaves reversibly even at zero temperature . in other words , in both cases the behavior of the system is governed by the absolute minimum of the energy , so the relation @xmath184 still holds , no matter the value of the anisotropy is .",
    "the main difference appears for high values of @xmath59 .",
    "first of all , the drop in @xmath181 observed in the @xmath100 curves is absent in the thermalized curves , since of course at equilibrium there is no coercivity .",
    "second , the bias field @xmath181 saturates to the value @xmath185 as @xmath59 increases ( @xmath186 ) independently of the anisotropy , contrasting with the @xmath100 curves where the maximum value of @xmath181 increases with the anisotropy .",
    "when @xmath187 the applied field changes the relative depth of the two energy minima .",
    "when @xmath188 the two minima have the same energy and the magnetization at the fm layer inverts @xmath189 , independently of the anisotropy .",
    "therefore , @xmath141 , i.e. the bias field reaches the saturation value observed in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the bias field at zero temperature continuously grows with the anisotropy due to the fact that the energy barriers between the minima increase with the anisotropy .",
    "it is worth remarking that , even at equilibrium , the bias field exhibits a maximum at @xmath140 for large values of the anisotropy .",
    "we found that , in fully uncompensated interfaces , the bias field displays a non monotonous dependence on the interfacial interaction strength .",
    "depending on the temperature and on the anisotropy to exchange ratio @xmath159 of the afm , @xmath4 can present a peak as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the peak is observed at low temperatures and high enough ratios @xmath159 .",
    "when it is present , the peak position moves toward lower values of @xmath3 as the temperature is increased , while below a certain temperature ( low compared with the blocking temperature ) the peak disappears .",
    "the peak is associated with the onset of coercivity , i.e. , with the appearance of hysteresis for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath156 ( region iii in fig.[fig10 ] ) , the behavior of the bias field is completely determined by the dynamics of the interfacial afm layer . for low values of @xmath3 the interfacial layer rotates coherently forming a quasi - domain wall that changes reversibly with the applied field . in this regime",
    "the bias field increases almost linearly with @xmath3 and thermal effects are negligible . above a certain critical value of @xmath3",
    "the quasi domain wall loses stability and the magnetization of the interfacial afm layer changes irreversibly .",
    "in other words , the bias field is controlled by the stability of the interfacial layer .",
    "this scenario , supported by both the monte carlo simulations and the simple layered model introduced here , explains why the bias field can be drastically reduced by increasing the interfacial interaction strength ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . also in this regime ( @xmath156 ) , the behavior of the bias field is independent of the lattice structure . in other words ,",
    "a change in the crystalline structure is just equivalent to a rescaling of the effective anisotropy of the afm .",
    "when @xmath190 , the system can still exhibit hysteresis and a peak in the bias field ( region ii in fig.[fig10 ] ) , but the the width of the domain wall increases as @xmath159 decreases . in this case bias ,",
    "field is controlled by the intrinsic pinning due to the anisotropy .",
    "namely , for large values of @xmath3 the bias field reduces because of the depinning of this domain wall , which depends strongly on the lattice structure .",
    "in particular , preliminary results showed that the pinning is stronger in the @xmath1 than the @xmath0 lattice , due to canting effects in the afm layers .",
    "a detailed study of such effect is underway and will be published elsewhere .    in both regimes ( ii and iii )",
    "the maximum bias field is smaller than the value predicted by msbk - model .",
    "these results offer certain insights about experimental findings in fef@xmath2 systems@xcite ( @xmath156 ) , where in a fully uncompensated interface the bias field is much lower than expected .",
    "in particular , it becomes noticeable at very low temperatures . according to our results ,",
    "if the interfacial strength interaction is strong the bias field becomes no null only at very low temperatures compared with the neel temperature of the antiferroagnet .",
    "summarizing , depending on the anisotropy to exchange ratio @xmath159 the bias field is controlled either by the intrinsic pinning of an extended domain wall parallel to the interface ( low anisotropy regime ) or by the stability of the first afm interfacial plane near the interface ( sharp domain wall limit ) .",
