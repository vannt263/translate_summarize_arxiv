    "in recent years investigations of photo - response functions in advanced materials have gone through a vigorous revival . in particular , laser `` pump - probe '' techniques , where a second probe pulse is delayed in time with respect to the pump pulse , provide unique information on the strength of electron - electron ( e - e ) and electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interactions in metals and doped insulators if an adequate theory is in place .    at present",
    "detailed experimental data on relaxation processes is collected for metals @xcite and high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "the pump - probe experiments are routinely analyzed in the framework of the so - called two temperature model ( ttm ) @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that electrons and phonons are in a thermal quasi - equilibrium ( qe ) with two different time - dependent temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of experimental data collected at room temperature @xcite allowed for a determination of the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling constant @xmath2 of many metals and low - temperature superconductors in the framework of ttm .",
    "similar experiments and their analysis were performed on high - temperature superconductors .",
    "the femtosecond time - resolved measurements on the high - t@xmath3 superconductors tl@xmath4ba@xmath4ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 @xcite and yba@xmath7cu@xmath5o@xmath8 @xcite found a relaxation process below t@xmath3 , which is distinct from the equilibration of hot carriers in the normal state .",
    "a relatively strong e - ph coupling , @xmath9 @xcite , a rapid decrease of the photo - response decay rate with decreasing temperature @xcite were found in yba@xmath7cu@xmath5o@xmath10 , and the phonon bottleneck @xcite or a biparticle recombination @xcite were observed below t@xmath3 .",
    "more recently a time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite and the standard pump - probe optical measurements @xcite have been performed on bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath11 .",
    "their ttm analysis has led to a rather weak e - ph coupling , @xmath12 .",
    "the pump - probe techniques have a potential to resolve a controversial issue on weather the e - ph interaction is crucial @xcite or weak and inessential @xcite for the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "the pioneering work by kaganov , lifshitz and tanatarov @xcite and subsequent ttm studies are based on the assumption that electrons are in the thermal qe - state because the e - e relaxation time is supposed to be much shorter than the e - ph relaxation time .",
    "this assumption is of course incorrect on a femtosecond scale comparable with the e - e scattering time of highly excited electrons , but the expectation has been that deviation from qe may not in fact have much influence on the electron energy relaxation on a larger time scale @xcite ( for discussions of ttm with respect to some experiments see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however later on it has been realized that nonthermal effects are essential even on a picosecond scale , comparable with the e - ph relaxation time , when conditions of low laser excitation power and relatively low temperature are chosen @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the e - e collision rate becomes strongly suppressed as a result of the pauli exclusion principle . numerically integrating the boltzmann equation with e - e and e - ph collision integrals groeneveld , sprik , and lagendijk @xcite",
    "have shown that the electron gas can not attain a thermal distribution by e - e collisions on the time scale of the e - ph energy relaxation .",
    "a departure from qe leads to an increase of the e - ph energy relaxation time with respect to the qe expectation . as a consequence of this departure",
    "one might underestimate the e - ph coupling using ttm .    while numerical integrations of the boltzmann equation can describe the time evolution of the electron distribution function on any time scale , they require a number of input parameters , which might be unknown a priori . here",
    "an analytical approach to this long - standing problem is developed .",
    "we reduce the integral boltzmann equation to a differential schrdinger - like equation using an auxiliary space reciprocal to energy and find exact analytical time - dependent distributions of electrons in both cases of electron - electron and electron - phonon relaxation .",
    "we also derive long - time relaxation rates of response functions and compare them with ttm .",
    "let us first consider a nonthermal relaxation of the electron distribution function @xmath13 caused by electron - electron collisions , which is described by the following boltzmann equation , @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the matrix element of the electron - electron scattering ( pseudo)potential , @xmath17 is the electron energy with respect to the equilibrium chemical potential . for transparency",
    "we drop the time argument in the distribution function .",
    "if the distribution function depends only on energy and time , @xmath18 , one can average this equation over the angles of @xmath19 as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the density of states ( dos ) per spin , with the following result @xmath22 , \\label{ecollision2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23    we restrict our theory to relaxations involving non - equilibrium electron - hole excitations with energies much less than the equilibrium fermi energy , @xmath24 . since the kernel @xmath25 has variation on a scale of the fermi energy , one can approximate it by a constant , @xmath26 .",
    "this constant is related to the coulomb pseudo - potential @xmath27 , important in the theory of superconductivity , @xmath28 . assuming a low laser excitation power we linearize eq.([ecollision2 ] ) by introducing a small non - equilibrium correction , @xmath29 , to the equilibrium distribution , @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 . keeping terms linear in @xmath33 and measuring energies in units of @xmath34 , which is the only relevant energy scale of the problem , one obtains @xmath35 . \\label{ecollision2l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    performing simple integrations in linearized eq.([ecollision2l ] ) yields @xmath36 , \\label{ecollision3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the familiar lifetime of electron - hole excitations in the fermi liquid .",
    "here we have used the integral @xmath38= [ \\pi^2-\\ln^2(a)+\\ln^2(b)]/2(a+b)$ ] with @xmath39 .    the second term on the right - hand side of eq.([ecollision3 ] ) describes a source of quasi - particles due to inelastic electron - electron collisions .",
    "collisions in cold degenerate plasmas differ essentially from quasi - elastic collisions in classical ( hot ) plasmas . in the latter",
    "the energy transfer is small compared with the electron energy due to a long - range character of the coulomb potential , so that one can approximate the boltzmann collision integral by the differential landau - fokker - plank ( lfp ) equation ( see , for example ref.@xcite ) .",
    "as one can see from eq.([ecollision3 ] ) it is not the case in metals .",
    "the collision energy transfer in metals is about the same as the excitation energy itself , which makes the differential lfp approximation unacceptable here .",
    "remarkably the electron - electron collision integral acquires a differential form in a reciprocal auxiliary - time space introduced via the fourier transform of eq.([ecollision3 ] ) , rather than in the energy space as in the lfp case .",
    "let us consider non - equilibrium states conserving the electron - hole symmetry , so that the non - equilibrium part of the distribution is an odd function of energy , @xmath40 .",
    "if one determines a function , @xmath41 then the boltzmann equation is simplified as @xmath42 we shall see below that a `` bound state '' of the effective `` schrdinger '' equation for the fourier transform of @xmath43 corresponds to the stationary quasi - equilibrium distribution . taking the fourier transform of eq.([ecollision4 ] ) , we arrive at an exact differential counterpart of the boltzmann equation , @xmath44\\psi(x , t ) , \\label{soliton}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 here another integral @xmath47 has been used .    the solution of eq.([soliton ] ) is found as a superposition of normalized eigenstates , @xmath48 , of a textbook hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath49 where coefficients @xmath50 are determined by the initial non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath51 at @xmath52 , @xmath53 the eigenstates , @xmath48 , and the eigenvalues , @xmath54 , are found from the schrdinger equation @xmath55\\psi_k(x)=k^2\\psi_k(x ) , \\label{soliton2}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 .",
    "this equation has a finite number of discrete bound states with real @xmath57 s @xcite and continuum extended states with imaginary @xmath57 s , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 is real ) . if @xmath60 is an integer there are @xmath60 bound states with @xmath61 and both bound and unbound eigenstates can be expressed in terms of elementary functions @xcite , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the normalizing amplitude and @xmath64 . in our case ( @xmath56 )",
    "there are two bound states , the even ground state with @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) and the odd excited state with @xmath67(@xmath68 ) . for relaxations conserving the electron - hole symmetry the ground state contribution to the superposition , eq.([exact ] ) , is integrated to zero because the initial non - equilibrium distribution is odd . on the contrary ,",
    "the excited odd state with @xmath69 is the only state , which survives in eq.([exact ] ) at @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 and ( using eq.([fourier ] ) and eq.([def ] ) ) @xmath72 which is precisely the result of the qe approximation . indeed expanding the qe distribution function , @xmath73^{-1}$ ] in powers of @xmath74",

    "the exact solution , eq.([exact ] ) , allows us to trace the relaxation at any energy and at any time scale .",
    "in particular fig.1 represents the time evolution of the total number of non - equilibrium excitations ( electrons plus holes ) , @xmath77 , for initial non - equilibrium distributions of the shape , @xmath78 $ ] , where the distribution width @xmath79 is varied , but the total energy , @xmath80 , is unchanged . for wide sources with large @xmath81 the number of excitations increases with time conserving the total energy in the process of their cooling . on the other hand , when most excitations at @xmath52 are created with the energy less than @xmath34 ( i.e. @xmath82 ) , their number decreases with time since their individual energies increase due to collisions with equilibrium electrons .",
    "one can trace the relaxation for any initial distribution including the case when a single photon initially creates a single electron hole pair , which cascades eventually into a large number of pairs until they get lost in the background thermal distribution .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of response functions can be readily obtained from eq.([exact ] ) by taking into account that only the excited bound state and the extended states with small @xmath83 contribute to the sum in eq.([exact ] ) , when @xmath84 . substituting the extended eigenfunctions , @xmath85\\exp(ipx)$ ] into eq.([exact ] ) with @xmath86 at small @xmath59 and integrating over @xmath59 yield @xmath87 in the saddle - point approximation . performing the fourier transform of eq.([asymp ] ) with respect to @xmath88",
    "we find @xmath89 the same result is obtained by using a @xmath90-approximation for the boltzmann equation ( [ ecollision3 ] ) , @xmath91 which has the following solution @xmath92e^{-t/\\tau_e(\\xi)}. \\label{tau2}\\ ] ] hence one can use the @xmath90-approximation , eq.([tau2 ] ) , on the time scale much longer than the characteristic collision time , @xmath93 .",
    "however this approximation is inaccurate on a shorter time scale because in contrast with the exact solution , eq.([exact ] ) , it does not conserve the total energy .    integrating eq.([asymp2 ] )",
    "yields a universal time - asymptotic of the total number of electron - hole excitations , @xmath94 as also seen from fig.1 .",
    "importantly the characteristic e - e relaxation time is quite long due to the pauli exclusion principle . using realistic @xmath95 and",

    "if this condition is not satisfied , one has to solve an equation for the non - equilibrium phonon distribution coupled with eq.([collision3 ] ) , which is outside the scope of this paper . under these assumptions eq.([collision3 ] ) is transformed into a form similar to the e - e collision integral eq.([ecollision3 ] ) , @xmath113 where @xmath114,\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and energies are now measured in units of @xmath34 .",
    "the eliashberg function is quite complicated in real metallic compounds because of their complex lattice structures .",

    "the eliashberg function is a narrow function on the temperature scale , so that one can apply a quasi - elastic approximation expanding the e - ph collision integral , eq.([collision3 ] ) or eq.([collision4 ] ) , in powers of the phonon energy , @xmath120 .",

    "apart from a numerical coefficient of the order of @xmath123 the characteristic e - ph relaxation rate @xmath124 is about the same as the ttm energy relaxation rate @xcite , @xmath125 , at high temperatures . indeed multiplying eq.([high ] ) by @xmath108 and integrating over all energies yield the rate of excitation energy relaxation , @xmath126 where @xmath127 . if we replace @xmath128 in this equation by its argument assuming that @xmath129 has its characteristic energy width of the order of @xmath123 , then @xmath130 hence the excitation energy relaxes as @xmath131 almost independent on a particular shape of the non - equilibrium distribution .",
    "to verify the numerical coefficient , one can substitute the ttm distribution @xmath132\\xi/\\cosh^2(\\xi/2)$ ] ( eq.([eq ] ) ) into eq.([rate ] ) to convert this into the temperature relaxation rate : @xmath133 eq.([rate2 ] ) is precisely the same as the ttm temperature rate @xcite , @xmath134 , since the ratio of two integrals in eq.([rate2 ] ) is @xmath135 .    according to eq.([rate ] )",
    "deviation of @xmath33 from quasi - equilibrium population does not have much influence on the energy relaxation .",
    "hence ttm @xcite is the adequate approximation at high temperatures , which agrees well with experimental observations in conventional metals where debye temperatures are rather low @xcite .",
    "characteristic phonon frequencies are exceptionally high in many advanced materials like copper oxides , @xmath136 k , so that the low - temperature regime , @xmath116 is of great importance . since all dimensionless energies in eq.([collision4 ] ) are of the order of unity one can apply a low - frequency asymptotic of @xmath137 in this regime .",
    "the exponent @xmath138 depends on impurities , disorder , and sample dimensions : @xmath139 in clean bulk crystals while @xmath140 in disordered metals due to a phonon damping @xcite and in metallic films @xcite",

    "the difference in the numerical coefficients in front of the integral terms originates in different statistics of scatterers , which are bosons in the e - ph case and fermions in the e - e case . at low temperatures",
    "the e - ph relaxation time has the same energy and temperature dependence as the e - e relaxation time eq.([taue ] ) , @xmath145 we also notice that the temperature dependence of the e - ph relaxation rate at low temperatures , @xmath146 is qualitatively different from its temperature dependence at high temperatures @xmath147 .",

    "their time asymptotic is found using the saddle - point approximation as in the case of the e - e collisions , @xmath156 and @xmath157 the time evolution of @xmath158 is widely independent of the width @xmath79 of the initial distribution function at @xmath52 as one can see comparing the lowest curves in fig.3 and fig.4 .",
    "the low - frequency eliashberg function is quadratic as a function of frequency , @xmath159 in clean crystalline metals , which makes an analytical expression for the fourier transform of the boltzmann equation ( [ collision4 ] ) unavailable in terms of elementary functions .",
    "however we can approximate all relevant integrals numerically as @xmath160 @xmath161 and @xmath162 where @xmath163 is shown in fig.2 .",

    "hence the asymptotic behavior of response functions in clean metals is qualitatively about the same as in poor metals , @xmath167 but the temperature dependence of the e - ph relaxation time is more pronounced , @xmath168 . in principle , the clean - metal `` potential '' , fig.2 , could have `` resonances '' , states that are in the continuum but take a long time to leak out resulting in some quantitative differences with the poor - metal relaxation .",

    "<S> the non - equilibrium dynamics of electrons is of a great experimental and theoretical value providing important microscopic parameters of the coulomb and electron - phonon interactions in metals and other cold plasmas . because of the mathematical complexity of collision integrals theories of electron relaxation often rely on the assumption that electrons are in a `` quasi - equilibrium '' ( qe ) with a time - dependent temperature , or on the numerical integration of the time - dependent boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> we transform the integral boltzmann equation to a partial differential schrdinger - like equation with imaginary time in a one - dimensional `` coordinate '' space reciprocal to energy which allows for exact analytical solutions in both cases of electron - electron and electron - phonon relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> the exact relaxation rates are compared with the qe relaxation rates at high and low temperatures . </S>"
