    "the purpose of this article is to determine the asymptotic distribution of critical values of random holomorphic polynomials of large degree , and their generalizations ( ` holomorphic sections ' ) to all compact khler manifolds @xmath12 of any dimension @xmath2 .",
    "we work in the same general setting as the articles @xcite on the distribution of critical points on khler manifolds and recall the definitions in  [ background ] .",
    "we first consider the critical value distribution of gaussian random ` polynomials ' @xmath6 as the degree @xmath10 and then consider the more difficult and interesting problem of critical values of @xmath13 normalized random polynomials with @xmath14 .",
    "we refer to the latter as the _ spherical critical value distribution _ since the ` polynomials ' are drawn at random from the unit sphere in hilbert space .",
    "we regard the spherical distribution as primary for the critical value distribution since a critical value is only counted once in a line @xmath15 of sections and one can relate the heights of the critical values to the other threshold heights of @xmath13 normalized ` polynomials ' .",
    "theorem [ maintheorem ] shows that a special _ normalized gaussian critical value distribution _ has a universal limit independent of the manifold and khler metric .",
    "the main result of this article , theorem [ pblike ] , shows that the _ spherical critical value distribution _ has the same universal limit .",
    "we also give a limit formula for the simpler spherical value distribution in theorem [ sdv ] .",
    "the spherical limit results may be viewed as a poincar - borel theorems for critical values .",
    "the spherical distribution of critical values is potentially useful in analyzing the morse theory of the modulus @xmath16 of random sections , since it is at critical values that the level sets change topology .",
    "they are also important in understanding the topography of random surfaces , i.e. the graphs of the modulus @xmath17 of ` polynomials ' of degree @xmath18 , which are often visualized as mountain landscapes above some given sea level .",
    "it is known that @xmath19 when @xmath20 and @xmath21 and it is proved in @xcite ( after a long history of similar results in other settings ) that the expected sup norm of such normalized sections is bounded by a universal constant times @xmath22 .",
    "thus in a measure sense , typical ` polynomials ' of degree @xmath18 and norm one have global maxima @xmath23 , and conjecturally the median should be of this form for some @xmath24 .",
    "deterministically , critical values of all normalized polynomials lie in @xmath25 $ ]",
    ". it would be interesting to know the exact height ( for @xmath13 normalized polynomials ) at which the peak of the random mountain first occurs . at a certain threshold height , the mountain tops are sometimes conjectured to form a poisson spatial process , and it would be interesting to know the connectivity properties of the landscape at lower sea levels .",
    "the calculation of the spherical density of critical points is only a calculation but it is probably a necessary one for the more involved landacape questions . the khler setting is a model for other settings in which one studies normed random waves with a notion of degree or eigenvalue , such as random spherical harmonics or more general riemannian waves on riemannian manifolds , in which the principal modification is in the asymptotics of the relevant covariance functions .    before stating the results , we introduce some notation and background .",
    "compact complex manifolds have no non - constant holomorphic functions and the natural replacement for them are twisted holomorphic functions know as holomorphic sections of complex line bundles @xmath26 . here , the fiber @xmath27 over @xmath28 is a one - complex dimensional space and a holomorphic section is a map @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30 .",
    "degree @xmath18 sections are sections of the @xmath18th tensor power @xmath31 of @xmath32 , and the space of holomorphic sections is denoted @xmath33 . its dimension is given asymptotically by @xmath34 when @xmath35 , i.e. when @xmath36 is a riemann surface , then the natural examples are polynomials of degree @xmath18 ( @xmath37 ) , theta functions of degree @xmath38 @xmath39 and holomorphic differentials of type @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the techniques and results of this article , as in the predecessors @xcite , hold in this general geometric setting .",
    "the khler metric @xmath42 determines a hermitian metric @xmath43 and connection @xmath44 on @xmath32 and on its powers .",
    "the hermitian metric satisfies @xmath45 , and the connection @xmath44 is known as the chern connection and is compatible with the hermitian metric @xmath43 on and complex structure on @xmath32 . as recalled in  [ background ] , the hermitian metric @xmath43 and khler form @xmath42 give rise to a definition of gaussian random holmorphic section in @xmath33 .    by a critical point of a holomorphic section @xmath46",
    "we mean a point @xmath28 so that @xmath47 thus the section is ` parallel ' at @xmath48 .",
    "equivalently , critical points are points where the norm square is critical @xmath49 and so we are studying the critical points and values of the real - valued function @xmath50 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath51 we note that @xmath52 is surely a critical value of @xmath53 since every section has zeros .",
    "however we omit the zero value in the definition of the empirical measure of critical values .",
    "when the hermitian line bundle @xmath54 is positive , as we assume , the only local minima of @xmath55 are its zeros .",
    "therefore the critical points in are either saddle points or local maxima .    to define gaussian random holomorphic sections , introduce a family of gaussian measures adapted to the hermitian metric and the associated inner product on sections . for any @xmath56 we put @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the orthonormal basis of @xmath59 with respect to the inner product .",
    "equivalently , the coefficients @xmath60 are complex gaussian random variables which satisfy the following normalization conditions , @xmath61 here , we denote the expectation with respect to @xmath62 by @xmath63 under this normalization , we have the expected @xmath13 norm of @xmath6 , @xmath64 thus the covariance kernel of @xmath65 is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the szeg projector with respect to .",
    "when @xmath68 we call the ensemble the _ normalized gaussian measure_. it is given by @xmath69 and from it follows that @xmath70 as will be seen below , the density of critical values has a limit for this sequence of probability measures .",
    "we discuss the relations of the densities as @xmath71 varies in  [ gauss ] .",
    "the distribution of critical points of a section is defined by the un - normalized empirical measure @xmath72 the chern connection @xmath44 associated with @xmath43 is not holomorphic , and the number of critical points depends on the section @xmath73 .",
    "the statistics of the number of critical points in the normalized gaussian ensemble was determined in @xcite .",
    "the critical point distribution is invariant under @xmath74 and therefore it is equivalent to work with gaussian or spherical distributions .",
    "it is proved in corollary 5 of @xcite that the expected number @xmath75 of critical points of morse index @xmath76 for any positively curved hermitian metric @xmath43 on a khler manifold of dimension @xmath2 satisfies @xmath77n^m.\\ ] ] here , @xmath78 is a betti number and @xmath79 is the first chern class , both of which are topological invariants .",
    "for instance , in dimension one there are roughly @xmath80 saddles points and @xmath81 local maximal for gaussian random polynomials of degree @xmath18 with the @xmath82 ( or fubini - study ) inner product .      in this article",
    "we study the gaussian , resp .",
    "spherical , distribution of _ critical values _",
    ", @xmath83 in the limit as the degree @xmath18 tends to @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the  value \" of the section at a critical point is the hermitian norm in @xmath85 of the section ; since @xmath86 it would not make sense to study the values themselves . in view of",
    ", we define the ( normalized ) empirical measure of nonvanishing critical values of @xmath87 by @xmath88 note that it is not necessarily a probability measure but from the results of @xcite ( such as ) it follows that for any @xmath89 there exists a constant @xmath24 so that @xmath90 except for a set of sections of measure @xmath91 .",
    "we define the gaussian density of critical values @xmath92 as the expected density of @xmath93 in the sense of distribution , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath85 . in  [ kr ] we will calculate the densities for all @xmath71 .",
    "the kac - rice are quite complicated for fixed @xmath18 , but for the normalized gaussian ensemble there are simple asymptotics .    to state the result we need some notations .",
    "we denote by @xmath96 the space of complex symmetric matrices .",
    "we also denote by @xmath97 the legesgue measure on @xmath98 .",
    "we also define the special matrix @xmath99 .",
    "[ maintheorem]let @xmath100 be an @xmath2-dimensional compact khler manifold .",
    "let @xmath101 be a polarized positive holomorphic line bundle .",
    "let @xmath102 be the expected density of critical values defined in ( [ expectdensity ] ) with @xmath68 , i.e. the normalized gaussian density .",
    "then we have , @xmath103 where @xmath104 here , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the volume of @xmath12 . the asymptotics can be differentiated any number of times ( with appropriate changes in the polynomial growth in the remainder estimate . )    henceforth we generally set @xmath107 for notational simplicity .    in the case of riemann surfaces",
    "when @xmath108 , we have @xmath109 . assuming the volume of @xmath36 is @xmath110 , then @xmath111 below is the computer graphic of the leading term ,    [ graph of @xmath112     the critical point densities for @xmath113 have the scaling relation @xmath114 ( lemma [ alpha ] ) , and from this one can determine the asymptotics for the other gaussian ensembles .",
    "we also give a similar formula for the simpler expected distribution function of random sections in  [ vdsec ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ maintheorem ] is is based on the kac - rice formula in lemmas [ kr ] and [ pz ] , which give exact formulae for all of the @xmath92 .",
    "the asymptotics then follow from the complete asymptotic expansion of the covariance kernel in  [ covariance ] . in the case of @xmath115 polynomials on @xmath116",
    "we give an exact formula for all @xmath18 in  [ fs ] .    as in @xcite theorem 1.2",
    "( see also @xcite ) , we can give similar formulae for the distribution of critical values when the critical point is constrained to have a specified morse index .",
    "the formula only changes in that we integrate over the subset @xmath117 of matrices of index @xmath76 .      as mentioned above , the critical point distribution is homogeneous , i.e the same for @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the critical value distribution is however not homogeneous , since the critical values are multiplied by @xmath120 .",
    "since the mass of the normalized gaussian measure is asymptotically concentrated near the unit sphere as @xmath121 , the critical values of a line of sections @xmath122 are weighted most for values of @xmath123 close to 1 .",
    "this weighting is a re - scaled version of the one in the classical poincar borel theorem , which states that the spherical probability measure @xmath124 on the sphere @xmath125 tends to the gaussian measure as @xmath126 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath127 is @xmath128 , then for all @xmath129 , @xmath130 moreover , @xmath131    our spherical probability measure is normalized haar measure @xmath132 on @xmath133 we refer to the corresponding probability space as the spherical ensemble .",
    "what we are calling the normalized gaussian measure concentrates exponentially on this unit sphere .",
    "we denote the expectation with respect to @xmath134 by @xmath135 and define the ( normalized ) spherical density of critical points @xmath136 by @xmath137 in fact it makes more sense to pass to the quotient fubini - study probability measure on the projective space @xmath138 of sections since the critical value distribution is invariant under multiplication by @xmath139 .",
    "we view the spherical density as primary because fixing @xmath20 sets a scale against which one can calibrate the heights at which interesting features of the landscapes occur . for instance , as mentioned above , the spherical critical value distribution @xmath140 is supported in @xmath141 $ ] , and its median should occur at a constant times @xmath142 . in the sequel we plan to study such distinguished levels in more detail .",
    "the main result of this article is :    [ pblike ] the density of critical values in the spherical ensemble @xmath143 on any compact khler manifold has the universal limit , @xmath144    thus , the spherical critical point distribution tends to the same universal limit as the normalized gaussian measure of theorem [ maintheorem ] . as the asymptotics ( and graph ) indicate , the most probable critical value and the median of the critical value distribution @xmath140 is around @xmath145 in dimension one .",
    "an upper bound for the median may be derived from the exact formula for the spherical critical point density . in a subsequent article",
    "we will apply theorem [ pblike ] or more precisely its proof to obtain a formula for the median and for the asymptotics of the critical point density with fixed morse index in special @xmath18-dependent intervals .    as discussed above ,",
    "theorem [ pblike ] is a poincar - borel type theorem for critical values .",
    "intuitively it is based on the concentration of normalized gaussian measure around the unit sphere , but in its details it uses the special scalings of the critical value distribution and the asymptotics of the covariance kernels and therefore does not seem to follow directly from the classical poincar - borel theorem . the proof is based on a laplace transform relation between the spherical and normalized gaussian critical value distributions .",
    "the poincar - borel relation between the normalized gaussian and spherical expectations of the critical value distribution holds also for the full value distribution .",
    "we denote the density of values in the spherical ensemble by @xmath146 . in  [ vdsec ] we prove :    [ sdv ] the density of values in the spherical ensemble @xmath143 of any khler manifold has the limit , @xmath147      other articles over the last ten years devoted to the statistics of critical points of gaussian random fields include @xcite .",
    "the kac - rice formula for the gaussian critical value distribution of holomorphic sections were originally obtained in @xcite but the asymptotics were not determined as explicitly as in this article . as mentioned above , we view the gaussian formalism mainly as a method for computing the spherical distribution . in the real domain , a kac - rice formula and an asymptotic analysis of the critical point distribution",
    "are given in @xcite .",
    "the expected value of the empirical measure is only the first and simplest of the many probabilistic problems on critical values . as in the case of zeros or critical points",
    ", one may ask for the variance of linear statistics ( pairings of smooth test functions with the empirical measure ) , the asymptotic normality of linear statistics , large deviations properties and so on . as mentioned above",

    ", one might instead use the standard complex derivative @xmath150 to define critical points and critical values , but it is in fact a meromorphic connection with a pole at infinity and leads to quite a different theory . to our knowledge , statistics of critical points in the latter sense have only been studied in @xcite . in @xcite , the authors studied the expected density of critical values of gaussian @xmath82 random polynomials @xmath151 defined on @xmath152 with respect to the meromorphic connection @xmath153 . also , in @xcite , b. hanin studies the correlation between zeros and critical points for this classsical connection .",
