    "the identification of high - energy ( regge ) dynamics in qcd processes has been long since theoretically investigated . with the advent of high - energy colliders like hera , tevatron and lhc",
    "such studies have become possible at experimental level too .",
    "the processes which are expected to be more sensitive to this peculiar dynamical regime , where the center - of - mass energy @xmath1 is much larger than all hard scales involved in the scattering , are the so - called _ mueller - navelet _ ( mn ) _ jets _ at hadron - hadron colliders  @xcite and _ forward jets _ at electron - hadron colliders  @xcite .",
    "both of them are defined by the presence of qcd jets at large rapidity , accompanied by any hadronic activity which is inclusively collected in the central region .",
    "such processes can be theoretically described by factorization formulae which involve several ingredients : the partonic distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the incoming hadron(s ) , the gluon green s function ( ggf ) describing the high - energy dynamics of emitted and exchanged partons  mostly ( reggeized ) gluons  and finally the so - called jet vertices , describing the production of a forward jet from the interaction of one incoming parton and a reggeized gluon . in the case of an incoming electron , an additional quantity , the photon impact factor ,",
    "has to be considered too .    at present , all ingredients are known at next - to - leading level in the respective parameters : the pdfs which resum logarithms of collinear type , the ggf resumming logarithms of the energy , and the jet vertices ( and impact - factors ) which are computed at finite perturbative order .    focusing for definiteness on mn jets in hadron - hadron collision ,",
    "the process - dependent part of the cross section is represented by the jet vertex  @xcite , which depends on the jet variables and the actual jet algorithm . by following the work of ivanov and papa  @xcite , in this paper we reconsider the computation of the jet vertex in the small - cone approximation ( sca ) , namely for jets whose extension in the rapidity - azimuthal angle @xmath2-plane is small . in particular we apply their method to determine the analytic expressions of the jet vertex for two particular choices of jet algorithms : the _ kt algorithm _ @xcite and the _ cone algorithm _  @xcite .",
    "these are the mostly used algorithms in modern jet phenomenology , in particular the kt one . on the contrary",
    ", the algorithm used in  @xcite can be traced back to the one considered by furman  @xcite in early studies of qcd radiation , but not used for practical purposes anymore , being infra - red unsafe .",
    "the aim of our work is twofold : on one hand we want to give a precise estimate of the error introduced by the small - cone approximation in the description of qcd observables at high energies , i.e. , at large rapidities , so as to possibly justify its use in phenomenological analyses .",
    "on the other hand , we want to estimate the differences occurring by choosing different jet algorithms for the same process .",
    "the jet algorithm dependence has already been studied in the past , and a detailed analysis of the cone and kt algorithms in the sca was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of collinear factorization . here",
    "we carry out a similar analysis in the framework of high - energy ( kt - dependent ) factorization , the basic tool for the description of the regge regime in perturbative qcd .",
    "one should keep in mind that the small - cone expressions are fully analytic ( before their convolution with the pdfs ) and compact , and allow a simple implementation in numerical codes that run much faster than those with the exact jet vertices . for this reason the sca jet vertices have already been used@xcite in quantitative comparison with available data@xcite .",
    "however , the experimental results were extracted by clustering jets with the kt algorithm , while the sca jet vertices used for the theoretical calculation were those obtained with the furman algorithm by ivanov and papa ( fip ) . also the small - cone analysis performed in ref .  @xcite compared calculations with the exact jet vertices in the kt algorithm versus the small - cone ones in the fip algorithm .    starting from these premises , and after reviewing in sec .",

    "[ s : jetalg ] we discuss in detail the differences among the three ( kt , cone and fip ) jet algorithms in the relevant case of two near particles and we determine the kinematical configurations in the limit of small jet `` radius '' @xmath3 .",
    "we then derive the small - cone jet vertices for the kt and cone algorithms in sec .",

    "[ s : nc ] we perform a numerical study in order to asses the quantitative difference between the exact and small - cone jet vertex in the kt algorithm , by comparing the vertices themselves as well as a typical differential cross section for mn jets and some angular coefficients measuring the azimuthal decorrelation between the jets .",
    "in addition we also determine the discrepancies of the same quantities induced by a different choice of the jet algorithm .",
    "we discuss the results in sec .",
    "[ s : conc ] , where we conclude that the wrong choice of algorithm causes sizeable errors on the predictions , while the sca within the same algorithm provides a good approximation to the exact quantities and can therefore be used as a valuable tool for a quantitative description of mn and forward jets .",
    "the process we are considering was suggested long ago by mueller and navelet  @xcite in order to study the high - energy behaviour of qcd .",
    "it is generated by the collision of two hadrons @xmath4  typically ( anti)protons  and is characterized by the detection in the final state of two hard jets @xmath5 with large rapidity separation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents any additional emission .",
    "each jet @xmath8 represents a cluster of particles grouped together according to some given jet algorithm and is described by 3 variables : the rapidity @xmath9 , the _ transverse _ energy @xmath10 and the azimuthal angle @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the @xmath13-th jet transverse momentum .",
    "the kinematical region where one expects the high - energy qcd dynamics to play an important role is given by @xmath14 where the condition of hard jets ( @xmath15 ) is imposed for the applicability of perturbation theory .",
    "in the leading twist approximation , i.e. , up to power suppressed correction in the hard scale parameter @xmath16 , the hadronic cross section @xmath17 can be factorized in the ( longitudinal momentum fraction ) convolution of two partonic distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xmath18 and a partonic cross section @xmath19@xmath20 where @xmath21 denote the parton flavours ( quark or gluon ) and @xmath22 the partonic momentum fractions w.r.t .",
    "their parent hadrons . in turn , in the high - energy regge regime we are considering , the partonic cross section for jet production can be factorized in a ( transverse momentum ) convolution of ( process dependent ) jet vertices @xmath23 and a universal factor @xmath24 called gluon green s function ( ggf)@xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the ( reggeized ) gluon transverse momentum flowing out from the ggf and entering the jet vertex , while @xmath27 is the center - of - mass energy squared of the partonic subsystem .",
    "the overall factorization structure is depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : fact ]",
    ".     represents the parton densities , @xmath28 the jet vertices and @xmath24 the gluon green s function .",
    "_ _ ]    the pdfs are non - perturbative objects that depend also on the renormalization and factorization scales @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "while @xmath29 is introduced in the renormalization of uv divergencies , @xmath30 enters in the treatment of the ir collinear divergencies which are absorbed by the pdfs .",
    "the @xmath30 dependence of the pdfs is governed by the dglap equations  @xcite , and their evolution kernels ( splitting functions ) are known at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . by means of global fits",
    "they have been determined in a wide range of the @xmath31 plane .",
    "the ggf is the central object in high - energy qcd , in that it resums the @xmath32 to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "it obeys the bfkl equation  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mellin transform of @xmath35 , defined in terms of an arbitrary energy scale @xmath36 .",
    "the bfkl kernel @xmath37 is known in next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) approximation .",
    "the coefficient @xmath38 depends on the choice of both @xmath29 and @xmath36 .    finally , the jet vertices are perturbative finite objects without energy ( @xmath1 ) dependence , and are known in nlo approximation : @xmath39 .",
    "they depend on the jet variables @xmath40 and also on the arbitrary scales @xmath41 , in such a way that the hadronic cross section be independent of those scales up to nll terms , i.e. , the scale dependence is present only in the terms of relative order @xmath42 .",
    "it is apparent that the determination of the mueller - navelet ( mn ) jet cross section involves quite a number of integrals , both in the factorization formulae  ( [ collfact],[hefact ] ) , and in the determination of @xmath24 and @xmath23 , as can be checked from their explicit expressions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when comparing the theoretical predictions with experiments , one needs integrated cross sections in some of the jet variables , in order to comply with the experimental binning .",
    "such integrations are mostly done numerically , and this would require a large amount of computing resources or time for reaching a precision at the level of 1% .    in order to cope with such a problem , two techniques can be exploited so as to reduce the computing time and improve convergence :    * to project the ggf and jet vertices on a complete set of functions which respects the symmetries of the process ( e.g. , azimuthal invariance ) ; * to use an approximated and simpler version of the jet vertices .",
    "these methods are often used in bfkl phenomenological analyses , and we shall illustrate them in the following subsections : the former in order to set up the theoretical framework and the main notations ; the latter in order to introduce the main subject of this paper .      the first method to reduce computing time does not involve any approximation , at least at the nll level of accuracy we are working with .",
    "it is better illustrated in the ll approximation , where the strong coupling @xmath43 is fixed and thus the bfkl kernel and jet vertices , in addition of being invariant under azimuthal rotations , are also scale invariant .",
    ", @xmath44 . ] in this case , a fourier - mellin transform diagonalizes the transverse integrations and the ensuing expressions are considerably simpler to evaluate .",
    "one can proceed in this way : first of all , let s exploit the fact that , in the ll approximation , each partonic momentum fraction coincides with the corresponding jet s longitudinal momentum fraction ( because of a @xmath45 in @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 so that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the rapidity distance between the jets",
    ". if we adopt the convenient and natural choice of @xmath50 as energy scale , the green s function  ( [ gomega ] ) is now independent of the partonic momentum fractions : @xmath51    secondly , we introduce the _ impact factor _ by integrating a jet vertex with the corresponding parton density : @xmath52 so that we can rewrite the factorization formula in the form @xmath53    at this point we project kernel and vertices onto the eigenfunctions of the ll bfkl kernel @xmath54 satisfying the completeness relation @xmath55 and providing the ll eigenvalue function @xmath56 @xmath57({\\boldsymbol{k } } ) & \\equiv \\int{\\mathrm{d}}^2{\\boldsymbol{k}}'\\ ; k^{(0)}({\\boldsymbol{k}},{\\boldsymbol{k } } ' )    { \\mathcal{e}_{n\\nu}}({\\boldsymbol{k } } ' ) = \\chi^{(0)}_{n\\nu } { \\mathcal{e}_{n\\nu}}({\\boldsymbol{k } } ) \\label{k0e}\\\\    \\chi^{(0)}_{n\\nu } & = 2\\psi(1)-\\psi\\left(\\frac{1+n}{2}+{\\mathrm{i}}\\nu\\right )    -\\psi\\left(\\frac{1+n}{2}-{\\mathrm{i}}\\nu\\right ) \\;.    \\label{chi0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , by inserting a completeness  ( [ comp ] ) between each pair of factors in  ( [ sigmafact ] ) , we arrive at the convenient expression for the differential cross section @xmath58 where in the last equality we have used the fourier - mellin transforms @xmath59 the delta functions on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ gn ] ) are just a consequence of the azimuthal- and scale - invariance of the kernel , and allow us to trade two bidimensional integrals for a sum and a simple integral .",
    "the azimuthal correlation of the mn jets is usually measured by means of the fourier coefficients ( @xmath60 ) @xmath61 because of the azimuthal- and scale - invariance of the vertices , it is easy to show that @xmath62 where @xmath63 is dimensionless , as jet vertex . ]",
    "thus obtaining a factorization formula with just one integration : @xmath64    such a structure is preserved in the nll approximation too , provided the impact factors and ggf are suitably modified in order to take into account the loss of scale - invariance due to the renormalization procedure and to the factorization of collinear singularities , which translates in a dependence on @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 of the ggf and impact factors .",
    "the expression of the ggf in mellin - space is very simply expressed in terms of the eigenvalue @xmath68 of the bfkl kernel : @xmath69 however , the computation of @xmath70 at nll level involves several integrations .",
    "the main advantage of this procedure is that such integrations can be done once and for all for each set of one - jet variables .",
    "nevertheless , such computations can still be rather lengthy , and the use of an approximate expression of the impact factors  to be described in the next subsection  turns out to be very convenient .",
    "let us conclude this section by noticing that the factorization formula  ( [ cm1 ] ) is very useful also in the case of cross - section integrated in jet energies .",
    "in fact , a double integral in @xmath71 and @xmath72 factorizes into the product of simple integrals of the impact factors ( provided the integration domain @xmath73 can be factorized into the cartesian product of two one - dimensional sets ) @xmath74 \\ ;    \\left[\\int_{i_2 } { \\mathrm{d}}e_2 \\ ; ( e_2 ^ 2)^{{\\mathrm{i}}\\nu-1 } \\psi_{b\\,m\\nu } \\right]^ *    \\\\",

    ", however , the expression  ( [ cm1 ] ) has to be numerically integrated in energy ( and possibly in rapidity ) , and a suitable approximation ( like the sca ) could be a very valuable tool to diminish the computing demand .      in order to study the behaviour of the jet vertex for small values of the `` radius '' @xmath3  to be precisely defined later on  and possibly to speed up the computation of the jet impact factor @xmath70 and of its energy - integrated version @xmath77 , one can use the small - cone approximation ( sca ) , as suggested and derived in  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the impact factor on the jet radius @xmath3 has the form  @xcite ( @xmath78 is a shorthand for @xmath29 , @xmath29 and @xmath79 ) @xmath80 and the analytic expressions for the coefficients @xmath81 were explicitly computed  @xcite for a particular jet algorithm ( fip ) .",
    "however , whereas the coefficient @xmath82 of @xmath83 depends only on the incoming hadron and is given in terms of the usual splitting functions as @xmath84   \\sum_{a\\in\\{q,\\bar{q}\\ } } f_{a}\\big(\\frac{x_j}{\\zeta}\\big )",

    "ivanov and papa  @xcite computed such coefficient for an algorithm which was used in pioneering work on qcd jets by furman  @xcite  we shall refer to it as fip algorithm  which , however , is no more used in present day phenomenology .",
    "the main purpose of our paper is to derive such coefficient for the two mostly used algorithms of qcd analysis , namely the cone - algorithm and the kt - algorithm .",
    "the computations can be repeated by following the procedure of  @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the jet vertices at ll and nll level are extracted from the perturbative calculation of processes with two incoming partons producing 2-jet at lo and nlo respectively . at",
    "lo the amplitudes have just two partons in the final states , each of which is identified with a jet .",
    "the jets are emitted back - to - back in the azimuthal direction and have no substructure .",
    "therefore no dependence on the algorithm is found at lo .",
    "the same is true at nlo as far as the virtual corrections are concerned . on the other hand ,",
    "the nlo real corrections involve 3 partons in the final state , therefore a jet can be constituted by either one or two of them . in the case of 1-parton ( simple ) jet ,",
    "all algorithms are designed in such a way that no further emission is found within a region of radius @xmath3 in the @xmath2 plane around the position of that parton .",
    "therefore , the differences among the algorithms are to be found in the 2-parton ( composite ) jet configurations . in the following section we will carefully compare the definitions the _ cone _ , _ kt _ , and _ fip _ jet algorithms and , from their differences",
    ", we shall compute the small - cone impact factors for the cone and kt jets .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , when two partons @xmath86 and @xmath87 are combined into one jet of radius @xmath3 , the resulting jet variables @xmath88 are defined to be @xmath89 to determine whether the two partons are to be combined , we see if they fit in a cone of radius @xmath3 about the jet axis in the @xmath2 plane . in practice , by denoting with @xmath90 the @xmath2-distance @xmath91 one requires @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the composite jet , which amounts the condition @xmath94 a simple jet can then be defined only if the two partons can not be combined , i.e. , provided @xmath95      according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the kt clustering algoritm consists in an iterative procedure which is based on comparing a set of resolution variables of single - particle @xmath96 ( b for beam ) and pairs @xmath97 @xmath98 one then considers the smallest one : if it is a @xmath96 , particle @xmath13 is thrown in the beam basket and removed from the list ; if it is a @xmath97 then particles @xmath13 and @xmath99 are merged into a pseudoparticle @xmath100  e.g. , by using the recombination scheme  ( [ conejet ] ) .",
    "the procedure is repeated from the beginning , until all resolution variables are greater than some ( hard ) stopping parameter @xmath101 .    in the case of three partons in the final state",
    "there are these possibilities :    * one of the @xmath96 , say @xmath102 is the smallest resolution variable . * * if @xmath103 then particle 1 belongs to the beam and we are left with two partons which , if not in the beam , form two simple jets ; * * if @xmath104 then the clustering stops and all three particles form simple jets ; * one of the @xmath97 , say @xmath105 is the smallest resolution variable . in this case 1 and 2 are merged into a pseudoparticle \\{12 } and one considers three resolution variables : @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . * * if the smallest is larger than @xmath109 clustering stops and we have one simple jet \\{3 } and one composite jet \\{12 } ; * * if the smallest is less than @xmath109 , a ( pseudo)particle belongs to the beam and we can not have two jets in the final state ;    to summarize , we have a composite jet , say \\{12 } , only if @xmath110 in the other case @xmath111 only simple jets are present .",
    "in  @xcite ivanov and papa define a jet as a set of particles within a cone of radius @xmath3 . to be more precise",
    ", they require that :    * the jet s momentum is the sum of the particles momenta ; * all and only the particles of the jet belong to a circle of radius @xmath3 in the @xmath2 plane and centered at the jet s momentum .",
    "this is just the jet definition of furman  @xcite used in the 80s for early phenomenology of nlo qcd jets  we denote it `` fip algorithm '' .    in the case under study , where at most two particles ( 1 and 2 ) can form a jet ,",
    "the condition for a composite jet is nothing but the prescription adopted in the cone algorithm : two particles such that @xmath112 can be considered as a composite jet .",
    "on the other hand , particle 1 can form a simple jet if no other particle is found within a distance @xmath3 from it , namely @xmath113 this definition is somewhat pathological , because it may happen that a given configuration can give rise to both a composite jet and two simple jets .",
    "this fact can be easily understood in the case of two particles with the same transverse energy and whose distance satisfy @xmath114 .",
    "they can form simple jets because a cone of radius @xmath3 centered on either particle does not contain the other ; on the other hand , a cone of radius @xmath3 centered halfway the two particles contains both of them .",
    "for this reason , it is not possible to extend such jet definition into an ir - safe algorithm to all orders , i.e. , with an arbitrary number of particles , hence it has been abandoned in favour of better algorithms like the cone and especially the kt one .    in any respect",
    ", this definition is different from both the cone algorithm ( in the case of simple jets ) and the kt algorithm ( in the case of composite jets ) , and yields different results when used to defined any observable .",
    "it is the main purpose of this paper to derive the correct expressions for the jet vertices in the sca for the kt algorithm and also for the cone one .",
    "in this section we shall compute the sca jet vertex in the cone and kt algoritm .",
    "the idea is to identify and calculate the contributions differing from those of the original paper  @xcite where the fip algorithm was adopted .    as explained in the previous section , for dijet production at nlo ,",
    "the differences among jet algorithms occur only in the way that two partons can be combined to form a jet . in the bfkl approach , two partons ( 1 and 2 ) in the fragmentation region of an incoming hadron",
    "are produced by the interaction of a parton stemming from the hadron and a reggeized gluon , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : fragkinem ] .        in the high - energy kinematics ,",
    "the incoming parton has just a fraction @xmath115 of the pure longitudinal momentum of the hadron , while the reggeized gluon s momentum @xmath116 is essentially transverse .",
    "following ivanov - papa ( ip )  @xcite we work in dimensional regularization ( @xmath117 ) and we indicate with @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) the ( @xmath120)-dimensional transverse momentum of the outgoing parton 1 ( 2 ) , and with @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) its longitudinal momentum fraction with respect to the incoming parton . in terms of these variables ,",
    "the relative rapidity and azimuthal angle between the two outgoing partons are @xmath123    we shall present our results by using the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely in term of their `` @xmath124 '' quantities , which are related to our definition of jet impact factor  ( [ phin ] ) by @xmath125 where @xmath13 ( @xmath126 ) are labels for the initial ( final ) state of the sub - processes contributing to the cross section , while the superscripts @xmath3 and @xmath23 denote real and virtual parts respectively .",
    "the condition for composite jet in the cone algorithm  ( [ conecomp ] ) coincides with the one adopted by fip  ( [ ipcomp ] ) , thus no difference is expected for the corresponding contributions .",
    "in contrast , the conditions for simple jets  ( [ conesimple ] ) and ( [ ipsimple ] ) are different , causing different contributions to the jet vertices . by using the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath127 is the transverse momentum of the parton forming the simple jet , @xmath128 is the transverse momentum of the parton outside the jet ( also called `` spectator '' ) , and one introduces the transverse vector @xmath129 @xmath130 which vanishes when the two partons are collinear .",
    "in fact , for small @xmath129 , we have @xmath131 and also @xmath132 therefore , the simple - jet condition  ( [ conecomp ] ) becomes @xmath133 at variance with the fip condition  ( [ ipcomp ] ) which , expressed in terms of @xmath129 , reads like eq .",
    "( [ conedelta ] ) but without the denominator @xmath134  @xcite .",
    "in order to identify the contributions of the fip jet vertex that have to be modified in the cone algorithm , let us recall that the simple jet configurations were computed in two steps : _ 1 ) _ by allowing the spectator parton to span the whole phase space and then _ 2 ) _ by subtracting the contribution stemming from the spectator parton inside the jet cone .",

    "<S> we determine the jet vertex for mueller - navelet jets and forward jets in the small - cone approximation for two particular choices of jet algoritms : the kt algorithm and the cone algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> these choices are motivated by the extensive use of such algorithms in the phenomenology of jets . </S>",
    "<S> the differences with the original calculations of the small - cone jet vertex by ivanov and papa , which is found to be equivalent to a formerly algorithm proposed by furman , are shown at both analytic and numerical level , and turn out to be sizeable . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed numerical study of the error introduced by the small - cone approximation is also presented , for various observables of phenomenological interest . for values of the jet `` radius '' @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the use of the small - cone approximation amounts to an error of about 5% at the level of cross section , while it reduces to less than 2% for ratios of distributions such as those involved in the measure of the azimuthal decorrelation of dijets . </S>"
