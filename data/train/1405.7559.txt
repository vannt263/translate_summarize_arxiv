    "low - mass pre - main sequence stars are formed with substantial rotating disks around them .",
    "these optically thick primordial disks are massive and have an initial gas : dust ratio similar to the interstellar ratio .",
    "as the system evolves , the primordial disk gradually dissipates , resulting in a decrease in the total disk mass .",
    "the dissipation may occur through various processes .",
    "much of the disk may be accreted onto the central star ; some material may be driven off by stellar winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dissipation may also occur through the coagulation of the smaller particles to form larger planetesimals , which may eventually lead to planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the collisions among the planetesimals produce dust grains that form the secondary debris disks . these are gas - poor disks , comprised of dust which",
    "is continually regenerated as the larger and more massive planetesimals trigger shattering collisions amongst the smaller bodies .",
    "dissipation in the debris disks occurs as the mass reservoir of large planetesimals , which supplies the observed dust , is depleted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the smallest ( @xmath41@xmath1 m ) dust is removed by radiation and stellar wind forces ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent near- and mid - infrared surveys of clusters and associations spanning a range in ages and masses have revealed extensive information on the disk frequencies and lifetimes .",
    "the main finding from these surveys is that optically thick primordial disks are extensively dissipated by an age of @xmath010 myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also at this critical age of @xmath010 myr that a rise in the debris disk frequency is observed .",
    "debris disks are commonly detected at @xmath010 - 30 myr as they are bright and have not had much time to decay yet .",
    "thereafter , the frequency declines roughly as 1/t over a time scale of a few hundred myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also notable is the dependence of the decay timescales on the spectral type of the central source .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the primordial disk lifetime appears prolonged in very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs compared to the higher mass stars , such that nearly all brown dwarf disks at an age of @xmath010 myr are in the primordial stage , compared to a @xmath010% fraction for low - mass stars ( 0.11@xmath5 ) and a null fraction for @xmath61@xmath5 stars . for the debris disks , the inner disk decay timescales ,",
    "as probed by 24@xmath1 m dust emission , appear shorter for the fgkm stars compared to the more massive b- and a - type stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rapid inside out evacuation of disk material suggests that processes such as planet formation are completed inside @xmath01 au within 3050 myr for the low - mass stars , resulting in very few 24@xmath1 m disk detections at these later ages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other processes such as , poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag , stellar wind drag , or planet - dust dynamical interactions may also be responsible for shortening the dust grain removal timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it should be noted that 24@xmath1 m observations of nearby stars are more sensitive , which explains why a higher fraction ( @xmath05% ; trilling et al . 2008 ) of these stars are seen to have 24@xmath1 m excesses , compared to observations of young clusters such as ic 2391 and ngc 2547 . on the other hand ,",
    "the differences in the disk frequency trends could be due to a luminosity effect rather than a mass - dependent effect , as the more massive stars heat up dust at larger annuli to the levels detectable at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the low stellar luminosities could make even a 10au disk so cold that it can only be detected at far - infrared wavelengths , as observed to be the case for the disk around fomalhaut c , which is only detected at @xmath6100@xmath1 m wavelengths ( kennedy et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the search for debris disks around brown dwarfs is a field which has not been explored to great lengths yet .",
    "previous surveys on brown dwarf disks based on mid- and far - infrared observations have all focused on ages of @xmath410 myr , at which brown dwarf disks are still found to be in the primordial phase ( riaz & gizis 2008 ; riaz et al .",
    "2012 ; harvey et al .",
    "we have conducted a photometric survey of brown dwarfs in the @xmath04050 myr old cluster ic 2391 , using the esa _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ) @xcite instrument ( 70 and 160@xmath1 m ) , to search for cold dust emission that would indicate the presence of debris disks . considering the trends noted above , no clear transition from a primordial to a debris phase is observed for the brown dwarf disks even at @xmath010 myr ages , unlike the higher mass stars .",
    "our main scientific goal is to map the evolution of brown dwarf disks over a wider age range , and to determine if the onset of the debris phase occurs at a later age for the sub - stellar sources , compared to the earlier - type stars .",

    "the ic 2391 cluster is therefore of interest .",
    "it has an age of 50 myr estimated via the lithium method @xcite and 40 myr from main - sequence fitting ( platais et al . 2007 ) , and lies at a distance of 145@xmath82.5 pc @xcite .",

    "data analysis was performed on the ` level 2 ' data products processed using the _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ( hipe version 11.0.1 ) .",

    "the 160@xmath1 m images do not cover exactly the same sky area as the 70@xmath1 m images , even though these were observed simultaneously ; one of the red band arrays expired in the last few months of _ herschel _ operation , which is presumably the reason for the difference in the coverage area .",
    "none of the targets were detected in any of the pacs bands at the expected source location in the maps .",
    "the objects with i d # 1 and 4 have a point source located about 10@xmath11 away in each case ( fig .  [ images ] ) , but considering that the _ herschel _ pointing was good to about 1@xmath11 , these sources are unrelated to the targets in question .",
    "there is some scattered emission observed close to the target location for objects with i d # 3 , 6 , and 8 , which can not be confirmed as a point - like source detection .",
    "we measured the 1-@xmath2 noise in the maps by placing a large number of apertures at random locations in each map , and then taking the standard deviation of these measurements .",
    "the aperture sizes were set to 4@xmath11 and 8@xmath11 , which are the optimal signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) sizes at 70 and 160@xmath1 m .",

    "[ iras ] ) seems to give sensible results when compared with the derived noise levels .",
    "the 160@xmath1 m noise is quite a bit higher than at 70@xmath1 m .",
    "this is in part due to instrument sensitivities , but is also related to the loss of some of the red array .",
    "looking at the individual images , there is some background structure that will have also contributed ( fig .  [ iras ] ) .",
    "the targets with i d # 2 , 5 , and 7 lie along a brighter region and also have higher noise , whereas , i d # 6 , 1 , and 4 have the flattest looking maps and these have the lowest 160@xmath1 m noise .",

    "we have also compared our upper scorpius ( usco ) fractions with the ones provided for different spectral type bins in luhman & mamajek ( 2012 ) .",
    "these bins have slightly different boundaries than the ones we have considered .",

    "we note that a recent analysis by pecaut et al .",
    "( 2012 ) indicates the possibility for the age of usco to be older ( @xmath011 myr ) than the widely considered estimate of @xmath05 myr in various disk studies ( e.g. , carpenter et al .",

    "the primordial disk fractions for the high - mass and low - mass stars have reached their lowest point ; only @xmath01020% of the disks at these ages are in the primordial phase , which indicates that a large number of these disks have experienced significant inner disk clearing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the disk fractions then show a rise again , from @xmath020% at 10 myr to @xmath040% at @xmath030 myr .",

    "the rise in the debris disk fraction for the high - mass stars between @xmath050 and 100 myr could be a sample size difference , since the pleiades sample studied by gorlova et al .",

    "no clear age dependence is evident in the case of the sub - stellar sources , as the primordial disk fraction appears to be nearly constant between 1 and 10 myr , except a dip at 5 myr , which is likely due to a different formation mechanism for upper scorpius brown dwarfs and/or the higher brown dwarf to star number ratio in this particular association , as argued in @xcite .",
    "the general picture thus indicates that protoplanetary disks around brown dwarfs tend to remain in the primordial stage for a relatively longer timescale compared to higher mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the non - detections for the ic",
    "2391 cases then suggests that there has been significant inner disk clearing , and that the disks around brown dwarfs have transitioned to the debris phase by @xmath04050 myr ages , resulting in photospheric emission and/or negligible excesses at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "a similar argument can be applied for the pacs wavebands .",
    "if we compare the pacs 70@xmath1 m upper limits for the ic 2391 targets with the observed flux densities in this band for the primordial 110 myr brown dwarf disks @xcite , then nearly 80% of these disks lie above the 2-@xmath2 upper limit , while the rest have fluxes at the 1-@xmath2 limit .",
    "thus there is a strong likelihood that any primordial disks with similar brightness and fractional luminosities as observed for the younger brown dwarfs would be within our survey detection limits and could have been detected .",
    "we can test this by applying a simple exact binomial test using the null hypothesis that there is an equal probability of detecting or not detecting a primordial disk in a single observation .",
    "the one - tailed probability of detecting a primordial disk for 6 out of 8 ic 2391 targets is quite high , about 96% .",
    "the p - value of 0.96 is significantly strong , being nearly a factor of 20 higher than the significance level of 0.05 , thus making the null hypothesis valid .",
    "the null detection rate despite such a high probability again indicates that a majority of the brown dwarf disks have transitioned to the debris stage by this age .",
    "given that there is presumably a range of primordial disk brightnesses , the fraction of primordial brown dwarf disks for ic 2391 can not be definitively set to 0% , but can perhaps be set to @xmath420% ( fig .

    "we note that a large number of primordial brown dwarf disks have not been observed yet at pacs wavelengths , and so the fraction that lies above our detection limits could be smaller than @xmath080% .",
    "nevertheless , our pacs survey has helped set limits on the primordial disk lifetime to be @xmath440 myr for the sub - stellar sources .    the pacs observations ,",
    "unfortunately , do not provide any constraints on the debris disk evolution around brown dwarfs .",

    "we also note that the 2m1207 disk was undetected in the spire @xmath0200 - 500@xmath1 m observations , which were sensitive to @xmath02 mjy level ( riaz & gizis 2012 ) .",
    "therefore , high - quality observations of large - sized samples with spica and alma in the far - infrared / sub - millimeter domain should provide clues to the dispersal processes and timescales for disks around sub - stellar objects .",
    "we have conducted a search for disks around brown dwarfs in the @xmath04050 myr cluster ic 2391 .",
    "none of the 8 targets were detected in any of the pacs bands .",
    "we estimate our survey to be sensitive to fractional debris disk luminosities of @xmath61% , and therefore only the brightest debris disk systems , if they existed , could have been detected .",
    "we suggest that debris disks of similar levels ( @xmath29/@xmath16@xmath2410@xmath20 ) as those observed around low - mass stars at @xmath04050 myr ages could exist around the ic 2391 targeted brown dwarfs , but be missed by our survey",
    ". it may also be the case that disk dispersal processes such as grain growth and terrestrial planet formation occur at a faster rate around brown dwarfs , once they have entered the secondary debris phase , resulting in a non - detection at later ages .",
    "most primordial disks with flux densities similar to those observed among younger @xmath0110 myr brown dwarfs would be within our survey detection limits and could have been detected .",
    "the upper limits from our pacs survey can thus set a constraint of @xmath440 myr on the primordial disk lifetime for brown dwarfs .",
