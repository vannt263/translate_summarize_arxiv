    "nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) of driven dissipative many - body quantum systems are of increasing interest , both theoretically and experimentally , due to their potentially strong response to external changes in technologically relevant contexts . for example , intense research has been recently performed on quantum transport through nanoscale systems driven at their boundaries . for molecular or quantum dot junctions , predictions of correlation - induced current oscillations and current - voltage bistability",
    "have been made  @xcite , while for spin chains sharp changes in magnetic conductance are expected due to a nonequilibrium phase transition @xcite .",
    "other interesting examples include recent studies of remnants of equilibrium phase transitions in dissipative settings @xcite , repulsively induced photon super - bunching @xcite , and potential super - solid phases in driven resonator arrays @xcite . a rigorous study of these open nonequilibrium quantum systems is very challenging , particularly in high dimensions , given the exponential growth of the associated hilbert space which prohibits direct classical simulation .",
    "so a natural question is whether their physics can be correctly determined from approximate schemes with reasonable computational cost .",
    "a frequently used method of describing interacting quantum lattice systems is to employ a mean - field product ansatz , in which spatial correlations are neglected . in equilibrium",
    "this approach can often yield qualitatively correct features such as the presence of phase transitions , although it can fail to correctly identify the exact location and critical exponents , especially in low dimensions  @xcite . for nonequilibrium systems",
    "the situation is quite different . even though mean - field calculations offer a first step to help uncover the intricate dynamics taking place , and",
    "have been used in several recent studies of driven - dissipative models  @xcite , it is not clear that they can provide even a qualitatively correct physical description .",
    "furthermore , reasoning based on the ginzburg criterion , according to which equilibrium critical phenomena are correctly described by mean - field theory above a critical spatial dimension  @xcite , can not be relied upon in nonequilibrium settings .",
    "this has motivated the recent development of several new methods to analyze driven - dissipative models , namely the self - consistent mori projector technique  @xcite , a variational minimization calculation  @xcite , a corner - space renormalization  @xcite , and algorithms based on matrix product operators ( mpo ) for one - dimensional lattices  @xcite .",
    "a notable effect predicted by mean - field descriptions of driven - dissipative models is that of bistability  @xcite . here",
    "the existence of two distinct ness is observed in a particular parameter regime , with the actual state obtained depending on the history of the system .",
    "however it is usually expected for systems described by a lindblad master equation  @xcite , such as those featuring mean - field bistability  @xcite , to have a unique ness  @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of whether this bistability is physical or an artifact of the mean - field approximation , originating from the effective non - linearity introduced by self - consistently factorizing the long - range correlations .",
    "in fact , recent studies have found that the bistability is washed out when correlations are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the impact of long - range correlations , however , is still not clear  @xcite , and interesting effects that might emerge are yet to be uncovered .    since bistability is a basic and ubiquitous feature of driven non - linear systems  @xcite , in this paper we examine in detail whether multiple ness exist in a dissipative coherently - driven quantum lattice system . in particular",
    ", we contrast predictions from mean - field analysis with results from tensor network theory ( tnt ) methods in one spatial dimension  @xcite , in which states are described by a matrix product ansatz .",
    "these calculations show that as long - range correlations are progressively handled more exactly , a single ness emerges . in its place",
    "a bunching - antibunching transition is found .",
    "this points to major qualitative errors in describing driven dissipative interacting systems if these correlations are neglected .",
    "also , given the formidable challenge to classically simulate such open quantum lattices , even using sophisticated tnt methods  @xcite , obtaining sound insight into the physics of these systems without uncontrolled approximations necessitates experimental realization and verification .",
    "thus we also discuss how a quantum simulation of the model discussed here in higher spatial dimensions could be implemented using current circuit qed technology .",
    "this would also allow experimentalists to confirm our predictions for 1d systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model_section ]",
    "we describe the driven - dissipative model to be considered .",

    "we describe a possible experimental implementation based on transmon qubits in circuit qed",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "in this work we restrict our attention to a concrete minimal model which nevertheless possesses features common to more complex quantum lattice models . specifically we consider a lattice of two level systems ( tls ) , each one with upper level @xmath1 and lower level @xmath2 , featuring coherent hopping linking adjacent sites , bulk coherent driving , and incoherent loss processes . the model is schematically shown in fig .",

    "in addition , we have verified that our results remain essentially unchanged when considering larger system sizes than those used in the calculations discussed in the manuscript .",
    "we start by discussing the physics of the driven - dissipative system resulting from a single - site mean - field analysis .",
    "this can be done by means of two different methods , namely by obtaining the ness of the system through a simulation of the mean - field master equation , or by performing a monte carlo wave function calculation  @xcite in the mean - field approximation .",

    "thus the equation of motion of each tls ( see eqs .   and  ) becomes dependent on expectation values of neighboring sites , leading to nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the corresponding ness is obtained by performing the time evolution for a particular initial state @xmath27 in the long - time limit , until convergence is reached .     and the r - l sweep .",

    "it is usually expected that in the absence of very particular symmetries  @xcite , an open system governed by a lindblad master equation such as eq .   relaxes to a unique ness , independent of the initial state  @xcite .",
    "however , as reported in previous mean - field studies of driven - dissipative models  @xcite , a bistable behavior emerges in certain parameter regimes , corresponding to the existence of two different stable nesss .",
    "whether the systems relaxes to one or the other ness depends on which domain of attraction the initial condition lies in .    to verify whether the system under consideration features a bistable behavior , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , for a one - dimensional lattice with fixed values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we take a detuning value @xmath41 such that @xmath42 , and obtain its ness for different random initial states . after verifying that such a ness is unique , we use it as the initial state for the calculations of detuning values @xmath43 , sweeping from higher to lower values of @xmath10",
    "; this is the right to left ( r - l ) sweep .",
    "subsequently we perform a similar sweep process but in the opposite direction .",
    "thus we take a new detuning @xmath44 whose unique ness serves as the initial state for simulations of values of @xmath45 ; this is the left to right ( l - r ) sweep .",
    "a bistable zone is manifested as a parameter regime where the solutions of the two sweeps are different , i.e. a hysteresis region .     as a function of @xmath46 , for the one - dimensional lattice .",

    "( b ) bistable regions in the @xmath47 plane for different values of @xmath7 .",

    "we first discuss the results for the r - l sweep . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) we show the corresponding local densities @xmath48 for all sites @xmath3 and different values of @xmath46 . here",
    "we can already observe two qualitatively different types of ness .",

    "namely , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3](a ) , a different critical value for the sharp shift between the low- and high - density regimes is found , @xmath63 .",
    "thus the mean - field treatment of the driven - dissipative model suggests the existence of bistable behavior . in fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) we depict the bistability zones for a wider parameter regime , i.e. for different driving amplitudes @xmath7 in the @xmath64 plane .",
    "these zones have triangle - like shapes , and become broader and shift to lower @xmath46 for larger values of @xmath7 .",
    "similar physics is obtained for two - dimensional lattices .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4](a ) , the density profiles @xmath65 for all pairs of sites @xmath66 indicate the existence of two distinct nonequilibrium phases of the driven - dissipative model : a high - density ness with flat profile , and a low - density ness with decaying oscillations towards the center of the lattice .",
    "in addition , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure4](b ) , the location of the sharp shift between both types of states depends on the direction of the parameter sweep , indicating bistable behavior .",
    "an alternative way to study an open quantum system described by a lindblad master equation of the form   corresponds to a monte carlo - type calculation . here instead of time - evolving the density operator of the lattice ,",
    "the evolution of several independent realizations ( or trajectories ) of the system is performed , each described by a pure state . due to the dissipative processes from the environmental coupling , the evolution in each trajectory",
    "is governed by a modified hamiltonian , and at random times quantum jumps describing such a coupling are applied to the lattice .",
    "finally , expectation values are obtained by performing averages over the sample of simulated trajectories .",
    "this technique is well known in the quantum optics community , and is described in detail in several references , e.g. see  @xcite .    to perform a mean - field monte carlo wave function calculation",
    ", we simply assume that at every time the pure state of each realization is a product .",
    "namely , for trajectory @xmath67 the state for a lattice of @xmath22 sites is @xmath68 , for long - enough times to obtain the ness of the system . in our particular case",
    ", we evolved for a total time of @xmath69 , with a time step @xmath70 .",
    "finally we obtain the ness expectation values of interest by performing an average over a sample of @xmath71 trajectories .",
    "to further smoothen the results , we also average over the final @xmath72 time steps .     obtained from each time - averaged trajectory , as a function of @xmath46 , for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and average over @xmath71 trajectories ( black solid lines ) .",
    "( a ) results for a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath30 sites .",
    "( b ) results for a two - dimensional @xmath57 lattice of @xmath58 . ]",
    "the resulting distribution of time - averaged populations @xmath55 for a central site is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , for both one- and two - dimensional lattices and the parameters of figs .",
    "[ figure3](a ) and  [ figure4](b ) .",
    "in addition , we show on top the average value over all trajectories ( black solid lines ) .",
    "we observe in both cases that close to the l - r shift of the product density matrix solution , the distributions are centered around two distinct population values for the same detuning @xmath46 .",
    "thus the mean - field trajectory simulations also indicate the existence of bistability in the driven - dissipative model .",
    "note however that the bistable regimes obtained from the product - state monte carlo approach are notably more narrow than those shown in section  [ master_eq_mf_section ] . in particular , for the 2d case the hysteresis zone has collapsed into a very narrow @xmath46 regime , located at the l - r shift of the product density matrix solution .",
    "this is because both methods , although corresponding to a mean - field approximation , are not equivalent . in particular",
    ", each individual trajectory @xmath73 leads to a contribution @xmath74 to the density matrix of the system , which does not have any classical or quantum correlations .",
    "however , by averaging over all @xmath75 trajectories and @xmath76 contributions at times @xmath77 from each trajectory , we are formally describing the ness of the system by the density matrix of the form @xmath78 which does not have a product form as in eq .  .",
    "thus in the product density matrix approach all spatial correlations are neglected , while the mean - field trajectory approach fully discards entanglement while retaining other types of correlations  .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , this already has a strong impact on the ness of the driven - dissipative model .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether considering more correlations might eventually suppress the bistable response completely .",
    "this question is addressed in section  [ mp_section ] by including long - range correlations in the description of the system .",
    "after analyzing the bistability featured by the mean - field driven - dissipative @xmath0 model , we wish to determine whether such a behavior is maintained when spatial quantum correlations are taken into account , or if it is an artifact of the nonlinearity induced by the mean - field description .",
    "furthermore , we expect to observe whether other interesting effects emerge due to these correlations .",
    "to assess the effect of retaining correlations , we employ an mpo description  @xcite of the ness @xmath14 for one dimensional systems .",
    "this approach gives an approximate way to account for quantum and classical correlations in the ness .",
    "intuitively , the parameter @xmath79 controlling the size of the mpo matrices gives a measure of the inter - site correlations , of either classical or quantum origin , so highly correlated states require a larger @xmath79 for an accurate description . in the extreme case @xmath80",
    "the mpo reduces to the mean - field product ansatz of eq .  .",
    "by solving the ness with increasing @xmath79 we connect the mean - field approximation with the formally exact but unobtainable limit @xmath81 . for",
    "each @xmath79 considered , the corresponding mpo density matrix is efficiently evolved in time under eq .   using the time evolving block decimation algorithm  @xcite , where the ness is obtained by taking the large time limit .",
    "we also perform monte carlo wavefunction simulations , where each quantum trajectory is calculated within a matrix product state ( mps ) description  @xcite .",
    "our implementation of both these methods is based on the open - source tensor network theory ( tnt ) library  @xcite .       as a function of @xmath46 for different scenarios , namely l - r and r - l sweeps for mpo approach with @xmath82 ( i.e. mean - field ) and @xmath83 , a single sweep for @xmath84 ( where the latter three coincide ) , and a trajectory simulation for @xmath85 . for the latter ,",
    "a time average was performed over the final @xmath86 of the total time of evolution , for which convergence was verified .",
    "the results correspond to @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "( b ) density profiles for mpos with @xmath87 , for the same values of @xmath46 of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . ]",
    "first we observe what happens to the bistable behavior when increasing the value of @xmath79 in the mpo description of the ness . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) for the central density @xmath55 , a significant change occurs with respect to the mean - field results when taking @xmath83 , where just a small amount of correlations is retained across the system . even though the bistability is still present , it shifts towards larger values of @xmath46 , and the high - density regime is notably lower that its mean - field counterpart .",
    "also , the bistability extends over a wider range of @xmath46 values , which might initially suggest that the bistable behavior is strengthened by correlations .",
    "however , taking larger values of @xmath79 shows that this is not the case .",
    "in fact , for @xmath88 we find that the l - r and r - l sweeps give identical ness , so the bistable behavior has already disappeared .",
    "in addition , the shift from the low- to the high - density regime is no longer sharp  .",
    "further increases of @xmath79 improve the ness , smoothening the shift between the two density regimes .",
    "finally , from @xmath89 the ness remains essentially unchanged with increasing @xmath79 .",
    "this is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) for the central density , and also for the density profiles in fig .  [ fig6](b ) , where the results for @xmath90 coincide .",
    "a similarity with the mean - field limit remains though , seen when comparing fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) with fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) .",
    "namely the high - density regimes also have flat profiles , while the low - density case shows density oscillations that decay when approaching the center of the lattice .    to provide more support to our results",
    ", we also obtain the ness properties of the system from a monte carlo wave function approach . in this case",
    "we represent the wave function of each independent trajectory by a mps with maximum matrix size @xmath91 limiting the corresponding amount of quantum entanglement . for each value of @xmath46",
    "considered we simulated at least 10 trajectories .",
    "to smoothen the results we also averaged over several hundreds of time steps , resulting in an effective average over thousands of trajectories . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , densities for @xmath85 already agree with those of @xmath92 for a mpo description of the density matrix , and thus further confirm that the bistability is broken when enough correlations are taken into account .    in summary , we have shown that the physics of the driven - dissipative system obtained from mean - field theory is _ qualitatively _ wrong , with the bistability being an artifact of the nonlinearity induced by the ansatz of eq .  .",
    "when a mpo or a quantum trajectory mps description of the ness are used with large values of @xmath79 , and the calculation becomes formally closer to the exact result , the bistability and sharp shift between low- and high - density regimes are washed out by correlations .",
    "now we show that a new interesting property , not captured by mean - field approaches , emerges in the driven - dissipative system when correlations are taken into account .",
    "for this we consider the normalized correlations , which can be rewritten as @xmath93 .",

    "additionally , for @xmath102 , they always remain above unity and decrease monotonically as @xmath67 increases .",
    "however , the most important observation corresponds to the correlations @xmath100 , which as depicted in fig .",

    "this indicates a transition from a regime in which neighboring excitations tend to cluster together ( @xmath104 ) to a configuration where the existence of such clusters is disfavored and excitations tend to spread out ( @xmath105 ) . in other words , our simulations show that the system features a bunching - antibunching transition .",
    "as @xmath46 increases @xmath100 continues decreasing until @xmath106 , where it reaches its minimum value .",
    "then @xmath100 grows again towards the mean - field limit , as @xmath46 becomes very large .",
    "finally we calculate an alternative quantity which measures the amount of both classical and quantum correlations , namely the entropy  @xcite @xmath107 calculated from the schmidt coefficients @xmath108 which result when the full ness density matrix @xmath14 is factorized into two half chains as @xmath109 and normalized so the first coefficient is @xmath110 .",

    "this correspondence between maximal entropy and fastest immersion within the antibunched phase indicates that the transition is indeed a strong - correlation effect .",
    "we have shown that in 1d the bistability observed in a mean - field description of the driven - dissipative @xmath0 model is broken when enough correlations are taken into account .",
    "this result agrees with previous calculations based on tnt methods and on a recently - proposed technique which introduces correlations among neighboring sites of the lattice  @xcite .",
