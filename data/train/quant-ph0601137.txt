    "the manipulation of cold atoms with optical fields is a very promising technique which is rapidly developping in the context of atom optics  @xcite .",
    "its applications range from laser cooling and trapping  @xcite to coherent atom transport  @xcite and matter wave interferometry  @xcite .",
    "optical fields have also been proposed as an interesting tool to control the dynamics of internal and motional states of cold atoms for quantum information processing  @xcite , and recent experimental studies have demonstrated a very promising first implementation with optical lattices  @xcite .    for these types of applications , an effective way of guiding or transporting the atoms while keeping their coherence is required . for atom interferometry",
    "it is also necessary to separate the atomic wavefunction between the arms of an interferometer .",
    "several experimental configurations have thus been explored for the implementation of an atom beam splitter with optical  @xcite and magnetic  @xcite field potentials .",
    "recently , various configurations of atom beam splitters have been implemented and studied with coherent sources of atoms  @xcite .",
    "indeed bose - einstein condensates are the best candidates for the implementation of cold atom interferometers because of their intrinsic coherence . however , for certain applications such as atomic clocks , gyrometers and gravimeters , thermal ensembles of cold atoms are still preferred because they allow for the preparation of a larger number of atoms at a higher repetition rate  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent experiments  @xcite show that high - contrast interference patterns with fringe visibility greater than 90% can be obtained with thermal sources of atoms .    in the case of dilute condensates , the dynamics is easily followed by solving the one- , two- or three - dimensional time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite . with a thermal source of atoms ,",
    "the theoretical description is more complex in the sense that many transverse modes of the guide are populated initially in an incoherent way .",
    "implementing a cold atom interferometer with this type of atom source is therefore not trivial and requires a detailed theoretical investigation .",
    "in addition , new opportunities are now investigated with spatial light modulators  @xcite for the implementation of atom optics devices ( guides , splitters ,   ) for thermal and coherent sources of atoms .",
    "the development of new theoretical models aimed at the description of the dynamics of a guided thermal ensemble of cold atoms is therefore needed for these applications .",
    "a few theoretical studies of cold atom beam splitters have been published recently in various trapping situations  @xcite . in these approaches",
    "it was assumed that the atomic wave packet was tightly confined in one dimension , and the effect of gravity was neglected . in the present article we study the cold atom beam splitter implemented in reference  @xcite , by solving numerically the time dependent schrdinger equation for the atomic motion in the presence of the gravity field and with realistic trapping potentials .",
    "our aim is to propose a theoretical model which can reproduce the main features of this experiment , and to test its pertinence for more elaborate situations .    a large ensemble of @xmath0rb atoms is initially trapped and cooled to a temperature @xmath1 in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) localized at the height ( see figure  [ fig : schematic ] for a schematic view ) . at time ,",
    "the trapping potential is switched off , while a vertical far off - resonant laser beam , crossing the cloud close to its center , is switched on .",
    "the dipole interaction creates a potential well of depth @xmath2 which traps a significant portion of the atoms in the transverse directions @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "rb cloud is shown at @xmath5 . when the magneto - optic trap is switched off ,",
    "a vertical laser beam is switched on and the cloud , partially trapped by the associated dipole force , falls in the gravity field . at time @xmath6 a second oblique guide is switched on .",
    "the two guides cross at the height @xmath7 and form an .",
    "the trapping potential seen by the atoms at two different heights is shown in the insets .",
    "finally , the atoms are probed 1  cm below the initial position.,width=302 ]    the guided atoms then fall due to gravity , with a confined dynamics in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions . at time @xmath6 , a second oblique guide is suddenly switched on .",
    "the two guides cross at the height @xmath7 and form an angle @xmath8 . a potential well , of depth @xmath9 ,",
    "is induced by the optical dipole interaction with the oblique guide .",
    "this creates an additional path for the motion of the atoms .",
    "depending on the various parameters ( light intensity , angle @xmath8 , temperature @xmath1 ,  ) a splitting of the cloud can be observed  @xcite between the vertical and oblique branches .",
    "in order to simplify the numerical treatment of this phenomenon , we restrict the dimensions of this study to the plane defined by the two guiding beams , _ i.e. _ to the @xmath3 and @xmath10 dimensions only . in addition",
    ", we adopt a semi - classical approach , where the effect of the gravity is treated classically .",
    "this approximation is justified by the value of the de broglie wavelength associated with the speed of the particles in the @xmath10 direction , .",
    "a two - dimensional classical trajectory is first evaluated by solving newton s equations of motion for an atom initially at the position with the momentum .",
    "an efficient variable time - step runge - kutta integrator  @xcite is used to solve these equations in the total potential , where @xmath11 denotes the atomic mass and @xmath12 the gravitational constant .",
    "the guiding potential @xmath13 is given by the following sum @xmath14 with @xmath15 in the previous expressions @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the waists of the vertical and oblique laser beams respectively , and @xmath18 stands for the heaviside step function .",
    "the following rotated coordinates @xmath19 have also been introduced ( see figure  [ fig : classic]a ) . the gaussian form of this potential arises from the gaussian intensity profile of the laser beam  @xcite .",
    "k , @xmath20k , @xmath21 mm and @xmath22 mm .",
    "the three trajectories correspond to an initial height @xmath23 and initials positions @xmath24 mm ( black solid line ) , @xmath25 ( red dashed line ) and @xmath26 mm ( blue dash - dotted line ) with zero initial momentum ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "the two guides cross at the height @xmath29 mm with an angle @xmath30rad , and the oblique guide is switched on at @xmath31ms . at this time , a free fall dynamics would give the position corresponding exactly to @xmath7 . unless specified , these laser parameters remain fixed throughout the paper .",
    "the thin vertical and oblique dotted lines reveal the geometry of the laser beams .",
    "( b ) deviation of the trajectories from a free fall dynamics in the @xmath10-direction for the same initial conditions as in ( a).,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : classic]a shows three typical trajectories with potential parameters close to the one chosen in the experiment performed in orsay  @xcite . from this graph",
    "it is already clear that , classically , only very specific initial conditions ( such as @xmath24 mm and ) drive the atom in the oblique branch .",
    "comparing the kinetic energy of the atom in the @xmath32 direction at time @xmath33 , @xmath34 , with the binding energy of the oblique guide gives the actual criterion which decides in favor or against the deviation of the atom from its natural vertical fall .",
    "this can be inferred from figure  [ fig : classic]a : the trajectory induced by the initial condition @xmath26 mm crosses the oblique guide almost perpendicularly at the point labelled 2 on the graph , with a maximum kinetic energy @xmath34 .",
    "this trajectory therefore remains almost unaffected by the presence of the oblique laser beam . on the contrary ,",
    "the trajectory associated with the initial condition @xmath24 mm meets the oblique guide almost tangentially at the point labelled 3 , and the atom is deflected from its initial vertical motion .",
    "the intermediate case @xmath25 follows a dynamics similar to the initial condition @xmath26 mm with a very slight deviation from the initial vertical motion .",
    "it will be shown in section  [ sec : results ] that this simple interpretation , in terms of individual trajectories , is not valid anymore when the atomic dynamics is treated at the quantum level .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : classic]b shows the deviations of these trajectories from a simple free fall dynamics in the @xmath10-direction defined by the classical expression . on the time interval , required to reach the detection probe located at @xmath35 mm , this deviation remains smaller than half a percent , and this justifies the approach adopted in the following , where the dynamics along the @xmath10-dimension is simply treated as a classical free fall .",
    "we now turn to the description of this semi - classical approach .      in the limit of dilute gases ,",
    "the dynamics of the cloud can be simulated by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation along the @xmath3 and @xmath10 dimensions for the wavepacket @xmath36 describing the external dynamics of a trapped atom @xmath37 since the initial state of the atomic wave packet can be described in general by a thermal mixture  @xcite , the calculation of an observable at time @xmath38 can be done by a simple thermal average once @xmath36 is known ( this averaging procedure is explained in section  [ sec : results ] , eq .",
    "( [ prv0]-[psv0 ] ) ) .",
    "the two - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath39 can be written as the following sum @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the kinetic energy operator along the @xmath42-coordinate .",
    "the semi - classical approximation discussed above is introduced by replacing the @xmath10 coordinate in the two - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath39 with the simple classical parameter .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the atomic cloud along @xmath3 is then described by the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the wavepacket @xmath43 @xmath44 with a one - dimensional time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath45 given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 . by adopting this one - dimensional approach ,",
    "the numerical simulation is simplified at the cost of replacing the two - dimensional potential @xmath13 ( equations  ( [ eq : vguide ] ) and  ( [ eq : v01 ] ) ) , which is time - independent for @xmath48 , with the time - varying one - dimensional potential @xmath49 .",
    "this potential changes slowly during the fall of the atom , and two of its snapshots are shown in the insets of figure  [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "we assume the atom to be initially in a well defined vibrational level @xmath50 of the vertical guide potential @xmath51 @xmath52 and we propagate the translational wavepacket until the time @xmath53 corresponding to the height of the detection probe , using the splitting operator method developed by feit _ et al _",
    "@xcite @xmath54 the total hamiltonian @xmath45 is splitted in two parts corresponding to the kinetic and potential propagators @xmath55 to decrease the error to the order @xmath56 .",
    "the kinetic propagation is performed in the momentum space , and the potential propagation in the coordinate space .",
    "fast fourier transformation ( fft ) allows rapid passage back and forth from one representation to the other at each time step .",
    "typical grids extend from @xmath57 mm to @xmath58 mm with @xmath59 grid points , and a time step of the order of @xmath60s is used .    at the end of the propagation the wavefunction @xmath61 is analyzed to determine the efficiency of the beam splitter and to extract detailed information on the state of the atom in each branch of the laser guide .",

    "it should be noticed here that the trapping probability only depends on the two following dimensionless ratios @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this is a signature of the fact that the trapping probability can be expressed in a phase - space diagram as the overlap between the atomic cloud distribution and the trapping condition  @xcite .",
    "the variation of the trapping probability with the ratio @xmath77 is depicted in figure  [ fig : trapprob ] . for a given @xmath2 , the trapping probability changes very slowly with the temperature of the atomic cloud . in a real experiment , trapping occurs along both @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath78 is therefore shown in figure  [ fig : trapprob ] to compare with the measurement performed in  @xcite for the ratio @xmath79 .",
    "finally , as one might intuitively guess , the trapping probability increases significantly when the size of the atomic cloud @xmath68 decreases compared to the laser waist @xmath80 characterizing the size of the trapping potential .",
    "( logarithmic scale ) for @xmath81 .",
    "the blue point located at the abscissa @xmath79 with the error bar is an experimental measurement extracted from reference  @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional trapping probabilities for @xmath82 and 2.5 are also shown as blue and green dotted lines with the labels ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively .",

    "the lowest levels dominate the distribution , and this is particularly true when the size of the atomic cloud @xmath68 is smaller than the size of the trapping potential @xmath80 . just as with the total trapping probability @xmath71 shown in figure  [ fig : trapprob ]",
    ", @xmath88 changes very slowly with the temperature .",
    "this variation is therefore not shown here .",
    "a typical quantum dynamics can be seen figure  [ fig : quantic ] , which shows the time evolution of the initial level as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath10 for the initial condition @xmath93 .",
    "this initial state is a stationnary state of the vertical guide , and it does not evolve in time until it reaches the height @xmath29 mm where the two dipole guides cross . afterwards , a wavepacket is created , and this one evolves inside two main branches , indicated by the white arrows .",
    "the oblique `` trajectory '' is guided by the oblique laser beam represented by the thin white oblique dotted line , while in the vertical branch an oscillating wavepacket is evolving .",
    "the picture obtained here is not as simple as the classical trajectories shown in figure  [ fig : classic ] since this quantum state can not be represented by a single trajectory .",
    "the consequence is that , depending on the initial conditions , the atomic wavepacket can be delocalized in the two guides simultaneously",
    ". a single initial quantum state can therefore split coherently along two paths separated by macroscopic distances .",

    "the probability @xmath102 is shown as a black solid line in the upper part of figure  [ fig : ps_v0_sigma0 ] as a function of @xmath50 for an atom initially at rest @xmath103 at the height @xmath23 .",
    "clearly , the lowest energy states @xmath104 are not deviated by the oblique guide , and they simply fall vertically .",
    "the explanation for this effect is simple : their energy is too small for them to be trapped in the present oblique guide of depth @xmath20k ( see for instance the lower inset of figure  [ fig : schematic ] representing the guiding potential around ) .",
    "the eigenstates of vibrational quantum number higher than are the only states of total energy @xmath105k . in an energy - based first approximation ,",
    "all states with @xmath106 should therefore remain unaffected by the beam splitter . in reality , all vibrational states experience a quickly varying potential in the vicinity of @xmath7 .",
    "they are therefore subjected to non - adiabatic transitions to higher or lower excited states which may or may not be captured in the oblique guide .",
    "this non - adiabatic effect is especially important for the highest falling speeds , and thus for the initial conditions @xmath107 and .",

    "the splitting efficiency of the state @xmath50 is therefore written as @xmath119 this state - dependent splitting probability @xmath113 is shown in the lower part of figure  [ fig : ps_v0_sigma0 ] as a function of @xmath50 for various sizes of the atomic cloud @xmath68 at fixed temperature .",
    "an interesting tendency can be noticed in this figure  : larger atomic clouds , since they favor the initial trapping of higher vibrational levels in the vertical guide ( see figure  [ fig : prob_v ] for instance ) , have a higher total splitting efficiency , and present a distribution of levels clearly shifted to higher energies . as a consequence ,",
    "the average value @xmath120 of the trapped states is for @xmath115 mm and for @xmath117 mm .",

    "the oblique guide is on when the atoms reach @xmath7 , but they reach this height with a kinetic energy which becomes comparable to  or higher than  the binding energy of the oblique guide @xmath9 .",
    "this explains why the efficiency of the beam splitter falls to 0 when .",
    "we have also calculated the variation of the total splitting efficiency @xmath121 [ eq.([ps ] ) ] of this beam splitter with one of the most crucial parameter  : the potential depth of the oblique guide @xmath9 .",

    "as a consequence , the total average translational energy @xmath147 of the atoms in their transverse direction decreases after the splitting of the cloud . with the parameters used in figure  [ fig : e_u1_u0 ] , a minimum energy of 10.9@xmath134k is obtained for @xmath152 , to be compared with the initial average energy of about 17.5@xmath134k .",
    "a significant cooling effect is therefore obtained in the transverse direction , at the cost of a significant heating in the vertical direction .",
    "finally , on the right hand side of this figure , with very deep oblique potentials , the atom temperature in the transverse direction exceeds the initial average energy of 17.5@xmath134k . in this case",
    ", a heating process takes place due to the fact that the atoms are now trapped in a much deeper potential .",
    "we have proposed a theoretical model for the study of a thermal ensemble of cold atoms in a beam splitter device .",
    "this model has a wide range of possible applications .",
    "for instance it could be used to describe the dynamics of cold atoms trapped and manipulated with the magnetic fields created by atom chips .",
    "we have used our time - dependent semi - classical model to describe the atomic dynamics in the presence of two crossing dipole guides .",
    "we have taken into account the gravity , as well as the thermal population of the initial atomic cloud in order to compute the splitting efficiency of the beam splitter .",
    "our results are in good agreement with experimental measurements , and we have presented the influence of the main parameters on the atomic dynamics in this guiding and splitting configuration .",
    "we have shown that some eigenstates of the system split coherently in the two branches of the guide , and that different average temperatures can be obtained in the different arms of the beam splitter .",
    "an efficient cooling of the atoms is also predicted in the transverse direction .",
    "all these results indicate that a high degree of control can be achieved in this type of cold atom beam splitters , using simple gaussian laser beams . in the future",
    "our investigations will concentrate on the theoretical description of atom optics devices ( guides , mirrors ,   ) for the manipulation of both thermal and coherent sources of atoms .",
    "combined with the very impressive capabilities of spatial light modulators  @xcite , these techniques should effectively allow for the implementation of new exciting experimental schemes in the domain of atom optics and matter - wave interferometry .",
    "we thank herv le rouzo for stimulating and helpful discussions .",
