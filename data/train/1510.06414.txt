    "we add m92 , where a high - precision differential analysis by @xcite revealed one star with a metallicity significantly higher than other cluster members .",
    "clusters that are not traditionally thought to contain internal metallicity spreads may exhibit small variations ( @xmath11  0.03  dex ) in fe and other elements when pushed to the limit of high - precision abundance techniques , as in the case of @xcite .",
    "the metallicity dispersions in m22 and have recently been called into question by @xcite .",
    "these authors report that the small dispersions observed could be artifacts of the analysis , and they have shown that spectroscopic gravities and fe  i lines may yield spurious metallicity results .",
    "other contradicting results exist , too .",
    "@xcite reported a spread in [ ca / h ] in based on the ca  ii near - infrared triplet .",
    "@xcite argued that this spread was caused by changes in the continuous opacity induced by severe mg depletions in some stars , rather than a dispersion in ca abundances .",
    "intrinsic abundance dispersions based on the ca  ii triplet have also been found in m22 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that no metallicity dispersion exists in m22 , but that result does not have a physical explanation since mg shows no depletions in m22 . while ongoing work seeks to re - examine the small metallicity dispersions ( @xmath12  0.1  dex ) in some clusters , the range of metallicities is so large ( @xmath12  1  dex ) in others that a legitimate cosmic dispersion must exist .",

    "the most striking example is m54 , which sits in the nucleus of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite )",

    "the elements heavier than the fe group , hereafter known as  elements , provide another perspective into the complex formation histories of globular clusters . in metal - poor clusters with no metallicity dispersion ,",
    "the  elements appear to have been produced predominantly , if not exclusively , by some form of rapid  process (;",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates a rapid enrichment timescale from core - collapse supernovae or neutron - star mergers . in the class of complex clusters ,",
    "the  elements show star - to - star variations in all cases where they have been studied ( @xmath10  cen , m2 , m19 , m22 , , and ) .",

    "the  material is thought to have been produced in other stars within the cluster , ejected into the cluster ism , and incorporated into the stars observed today ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the chemical enrichment scenarios to explain these signatures are neither simple nor uniform from one cluster to another .",

    "previous work by @xcite did not detect a metallicity spread among these 26  stars , either , and only detected a possible spread among the fainter stars in their sample .",
    "other elements in the fe group show no significant star - to - star dispersion , and their ratios are well - matched to those in field stars with similar stellar parameters and metallicities .",
    "the [ mg / fe ] ratios in  have a large star - to - star dispersion , 0.28  dex , which is only found among some luminous , metal - poor clusters like , m3 , m13 , m15 , , , , and . our limited data on o , na , and",

    "we consider , and dismiss , the possibilities that this star self - enriched or obtained the  material from a companion that passed through the agb phase of evolution .",
    "the  pattern resembles that found in groups of stars in the other low - metallicity clusters m2 , m22 , and .",
    "mounting evidence suggests that intermediate - mass agb stars ( @xmath22  36  ) were responsible for producing the  material during the time of star formation in these clusters .",
    "the percentage of -enhanced stars in is within the range of that found in other clusters in this peculiar class .",
