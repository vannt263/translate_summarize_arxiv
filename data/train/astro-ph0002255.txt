    "the bl lac object mkn 501 is very close ( @xmath2 , ulrich et al .",
    "@xcite ) and has been studied extensively at all wavelengths . together with its sister object",
    "mkn 421 , it was among the two first bl  lac objects with known radio ( colla et al .",
    "@xcite ) , x - ray ( schwartz et al .",
    "@xcite ) and tev gamma - ray ( quinn et al .",
    "@xcite , bradbury et al .",
    "@xcite ) counterparts .",
    "recently , it was also marginally detected at photon energies @xmath3  mev by the egret instrument on board cgro ( kataoka et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    during 1997",
    ", the object was found to be in an extreme high state with a tev flux on average 20 times higher than in 1996 ( breslin et al .",
    "the source exhibited strong variability on timescales of days with a possible quasi - periodically varying component with a timescale of about 25 days ( kranich et al .",
    "@xcite ) . to complete the list of reasons for excitement for the observers , mkn  501 reached in some of its flares fluxes of more than 10@xmath4  @xmath5s@xmath6 ( above 1.5  tev ) - the most intense tev emission ever measured so far from any astronomical object . however , the shortest observed variability timescale ( 5 hours , aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) was significantly longer than that observed for mkn  421 ( gaidos et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "all available tev observatories monitored the event for several months ( samuelson et al .",
    "@xcite , aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , hayashida et al .",
    "@xcite , djannati - ata et al .",
    "the most complete dataset was produced by the hegra cherenkov telescope `` 1 '' ( ct1 ) ( aharonian et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) which was even able to observe mkn  501 under the presence of moonlight , however with reduced sensitivity , thereby filling many gaps in the lightcurve .",
    "this telescope also obtained the confirmatory observations in 1996 .    also from hegra come probably the most accurate spectral measurements in the tev regime .",
    "they were carried out by the hegra system of ( at the time 4 ) cherenkov telescopes ( cts ) and are largely concurrent with the ct1 measurements , however with less time coverage ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the tev @xmath1-ray emission and the reasons for its variability are still essentially unknown .",
    "the most popular models explain the tev emission as near - infrared to uv photons which have been upscattered via the inverse compton effect by very high energy electrons which are known from radio , optical and x - ray observations to be present in the jets of bl lac objects .",
    "possible sources of the seed photons for compton scattering are the synchrotron radiation produced within the jet by the same population of relativistic electrons ( synchrotron self - compton model , ssc ; marscher & gear @xcite ; maraschi , celotti & ghisellini @xcite ; bloom & marscher @xcite ) , or radiation from outside the jet ( external inverse compton model , eic )",
    ". this external radiation could be the quasi - thermal radiation field of an accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole which is generally believed to power the relativistic jets .",
    "the accretion disk radiation can enter the jet either directly ( dermer , schlickeiser & mastichiadis @xcite , dermer & schlickeiser @xcite ) or after being rescattered by circumnuclear material ( sikora , begelman & rees @xcite , blandford & levinson @xcite , dermer , sturner & schlickeiser @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that synchrotron radiation produced within the jet and reflected by circumnuclear debris is the dominant source of soft photons during flares ( ghisellini & madau @xcite , bednarek @xcite ) , although it has been shown that this process is unlikely to be efficient in the case of bl  lac objects ( bttcher & dermer @xcite ) .",
    "as an alternative , mannheim ( @xcite ) has suggested a hadronic model in which protons are the primarily accelerated particles in the jet and the @xmath1-ray emission is produced by secondary pions and electron - positron pairs produced in photopion and photopair production interactions of the ultrarelativistic protons in the jet with external radiation .",
    "the time - averaged broadband spectrum of mkn  501 has been fitted using this model by mannheim et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) . however , the attempts to explain the short and intermediate - term variability of blazars with hadronic jet models have only just started ( rachen & mannheim @xcite ) . for this reason",
    ", we concentrate on leptonic jet models in this paper since the variability time scales predicted by these models are in good agreement with the observed intraday variability of blazars .    recently , fossati et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have compared the broadband spectra of different types of @xmath1-ray emitting agn and suggested a continuous sequence fsrqs ( flat spectrum radio quasars ) @xmath7 lbls ( low - frequency peaked bl  lac objects ) @xmath7 hbls ( high - frequency peaked bl  lac objects ) , characterized by decreasing bolometric luminosity , decreasing dominance of the total energy output in @xmath1-rays compared to the emission at lower frequencies and a shift of the peak frequencies of the synchrotron and the @xmath1-ray component towards higher frequencies .",
    "recent modelling efforts of various blazar - type agn have revealed that this sequence is consistent with a decreasing importance of external radiation as a source of soft photons for compton scattering in the jet ( ghisellini et al .",
    "this suggests that the extreme hbls like mkn  501 or mkn  421 can be well fitted with strongly ssc - dominated jet models , as was shown , e. g. , by mastichiadis & kirk ( @xcite ) and pian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    from the ssc model one expects a strong correlation between the x - ray and the tev emission . and",
    "indeed , by comparing the daily tev measurements with daily averages from the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , a significant correlation with a most probable time - lag of 0 days ( no time - lag ) was found ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore",
    ", a clear overall x - ray high state was visible in the 1997 asm measurements which coincided with the tev high state ( see also figure [ fig - lightcurve ] ) . and ,",
    "as discovered by bepposax , the x - ray peak of the spectral energy distibution ( sed ) had shifted from 10 - 20 kev in 1996 to 100 - 200 kev in 1997 ( pian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , consistent with the assumption that the x - ray and tev-@xmath1-ray flares are produced by a more powerful electron acceleration , shifting the high - energy cutoff of the electron distribution to higher energies and hardening the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this observation was , however , only made during one flare in 1997 . in this paper",
    "we give evidence that the hardening took place during all flares in 1997 .",
    "an alternative explanation for the synchrotron spectral changes , in terms of a steadily - emitting helical - jet model , has been presented by villata & raiteri ( @xcite ) .    apart from the short - term variability on timescales of hours to days , there is also a longer - term variability in blazars which has so far been investigated mainly in the optical regime ( see e.g. katajainen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and references therein ) and recently also in x - rays ( e.g. mc hardy @xcite ) .",
    "this variability shows remarkable amplitudes ( e.g. 4.7 mag for mkn 421 in the optical ) and in the case of oj 287 there is even evidence for periodicity .    in this respect mkn 501",
    "is not yet very well explored .",
    "mkn 501 has been observed in the tev regime since its discovery in 1995 .",
    "the source showed low emission close to the sensitivity limits until the onset of the 1997 high state .",
    "since the duty cycle of the tev observatories is only about 10 % , this does not prove the absence of strong short flares prior to this high state , but the increased average intensity of the source can be described as an increase in flaring probability from 1996 to 1997 by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "this description is especially appropriate since even during the high state , the source returns to quiescent ( comparable with 1996 ) levels of emission for periods of up to a few days .",
    "these transitions are seen irrespective of the presence of short , strong flares on time - scales of a day .",
    "the last observations in 1996 were made in august and found mkn 501 still quiescent while the first observations in 1997 were made in february and found the source already flaring .",
    "the transition from low to high flaring probability obviously took place on timescales shorter than half a year .",
    "the correlated x - ray data from the rxte asm confirm this and show in addition that the change has been a smooth process over several months ( see e.g. figure 8 in aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this article",
    "we explore the multi - wavelength variability of mkn 501 over medium timescales , and try to relate its behaviour to the physical parameters of a leptonic jet model . for this purpose",
    "we construct weekly seds using the hegra ct1 flux data and hegra ct system spectral data together with data from longer wavelengths , namely radio , optical , soft x - ray and hard x - rays .",
    "see table [ tab - instruments ] for an enumeration of the instruments and energy ranges .",
    "this paper may represent an important step toward understanding the origin of strong changes in the flaring probability of mkn 501 and blazars in general , but our data is clearly not sufficient to give a final answer to this question .    all data except that from hegra and the rxte asm are published here for the first time .",
    "the batse data are especially valuable since they confine the intensity at the x - ray peak of the sed .",
    "the observations used to fit the multi - wavelength spectrum cover mostly the synchrotron part of the sed . only the tev data explore what is believed to be the inverse compton emission , although osse and egret observations cover a few days in 1996 and 1997 . as a guide line for our fitting procedure we take into account",
    "the highest ever observed egret flux from mkn  501 , @xmath8  photons  @xmath5  s@xmath6 with a photon spectral index @xmath9 , measured during 1996 mar 25 - 28 ( kataoka et al .",
    "@xcite ) , as an upper limit .    in the definition of time - bins for the multi - wavelength dataset , we start by subdividing the hegra ct1 lightcurve and bin all other data accordingly .",
    "the data from hegra are binned in time from march through october 1997 ( mjd 50514 - mjd 50708 ) resulting in 28 equidistant time bins .",
    "this weekly temporal resolution is an order of magnitude larger that the longest observed tev intraday variability timescale of 15 h ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) and is believed appropriate , given the nature of the available data and the medium scale variability timescale which we have chosen to explore .",
    "however , the hegra points are not spread as uniformly over time as are the batse and rxte data .",
    "the `` center of gravity in observation time '' ( defined as the weighted mean of the observation time of the daily points each weighted by the duration of the individual observation ) from hegra would therefore in general not coincide with that from batse and rxte . in order to compensate for this",
    ", we calculate the center of gravity in observation - time for each weekly hegra timebin and use these as time - bin-_centers _ for the other data .",
    "the edges of these bins are then defined by the average of two adjacent bin - centers .",
    "figure [ fig - lightcurve ] shows the lightcurves from each instrument which went into this analysis .",
    "the weekly points after the binning are given in table [ tab - data ] .",
    "the first column in the table gives the bin - centers as described above .",
    "the following subsections describe the data used to compile the table .",
    "the optical observations were performed using the telescopes and filters listed in table  [ tab - instruments ] .",
    "all the observations were made with ccd - cameras .",
    "all ccd - images were treated the normal way with flat field and bias corrections .",
    "the magnitudes were measured using either daophot in iraf ( not and tuorla data ; for more details see katajainen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or with the robin - procedure developed in torino ( e.g. villata et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or using the automated reduction routine developed in perugia ( e.g. tosti et al .",
    "all magnitudes were measured using 10 arcsecond aperture .",
    "the use of the same aperture is important because mkn  501 has a large host galaxy ( e.g. nilsson et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for the calibration we used the calibration sequence given by fiorucci & tosti ( @xcite ) and villata et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "for some of the weekly observing periods , no optical data were available .",
    "however , the optical flux is extremely important for constraining the spectral index of the synchrotron spectra in the optical  x - ray range , which , in turn , is essential for constraining the spectral index of the electron spectrum . as can be seen in table [ tab - data ] , the optical flux exhibits only moderate variability on the time scales considered here .",
    "thus , for fitting purposes we assume that the optical flux during those viewing periods for which no optical observations were available , was within the range of optical fluxes observed during the whole campaign which yields @xmath10  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath6 .",
    "the radio observations were made with the metshovi radio telescope at 22 ghz as part of the ongoing quasar monitoring program , which started in 1980 .",
    "currently about 85 sources , mainly northern flat spectrum quasars , should be observed monthly at 22 and 37 ghz .",
    "the total number of observations is now over 40000 . for details of the observing strategy and reductions , as well as",
    "the data until 1995.5 see tersranta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the integration time of each point was essentially the same , so single points were formed from the data points in the individual timebins by simple averaging .",
    "since the beginning of 1996 , the all - sky monitor ( asm ) of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite has been observing mkn 501 in the 2 - 12 kev energy band .",
    "the data used in this analysis are taken from the publicly available asm data products provided by the asm / rxte teams at mit and at the rxte sof and gof at nasa s gsfc .",
    "these measurements are given by the authors ( see e.g. levine et al .",
    "@xcite ) as rates @xmath11 in units of counts per second in three energy bins : 1.3 - 3.0 kev , 3.0 - 5.0 kev , and 5.0 - 12.1 kev . from these",
    "we calculate the total rate @xmath12 by summing the three bins .    for mkn 501",
    "we obtain by averaging over the period mjd 50510 - 50710 @xmath13    in order to assess the x - ray spectrum and flux of mkn 501 , we use the asm data for the crab nebula which is publicly available from the same source .",
    "the average rate of the crab nebula during the period mjd 50510  50710 is @xmath14 hence , in soft x - rays , mkn 501 is even during this high state a significantly weaker source than the crab nebula .    in the energy range 2 kev to 60 kev",
    ", the spectrum of the crab nebula is a stable power law .",
    "the spectral index of the differential photon spectrum is known with an accuracy of 1% to be @xmath15 ( e.g. toor & seward @xcite , pravdo & serlemitsos @xcite or pravdo , angelini & harding @xcite ) .",
    "the emission measured by the rxte asm is the sum of the steady nebula and the pulsed crab pulsar emission .",
    "the latter has on average a harder spectrum than the nebula .",
    "below 12.1 kev , however , the pulsed fraction of this emission is @xmath16  % .",
    "we can therefore use the knowledge of the crab nebula spectrum to derive an approximate relative calibration factor @xmath17 for the rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 using @xmath20 where @xmath21  kev , @xmath22  kev , and @xmath23  kev are the energy bin edges of the second and third energy bin .",
    "we ignore the first energy bin since it is strongly influenced by interstellar x - ray absorption which is dependent on the column density and hence varies between sources ( remillard @xcite ) .",
    "averaging over the available crab data from the observation period under discussion ( mjd 50510 - 50710 ) we obtain @xmath24 .",
    "there is no indication of a variability of the value of @xmath17 ( see figure [ fig - k ] ) .",
    "hence we can assume that it is also valid for the mkn 501 observations of the same detector . in order take into account that there is a pulsed component with a harder spectrum ,",
    "we add an additional error of 8 % to the error of @xmath25 and obtain thus @xmath26    for mkn 501 we calculate the spectral index @xmath27 of the differential photon spectrum using the equation @xmath28 and varying @xmath27 until the two sides of the equation are equal to an accuracy better than 0.1  % .",
    "the error @xmath29 of this index , we estimate from the approximate formula @xmath30 which leads to @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the errors of the corresponding quantities . the time resolved values for @xmath35 are shown in figure [ fig - alphas ] .",
    "the same method applied to the crab nebula data ( however with @xmath36 ) yields , as expected , on average the spectral index we have put in .",
    "also this is shown in figure [ fig - alphas ] . from a constant fit to the values in this figure , we obtain @xmath37 and @xmath38 thus we find that during the 1997 high state , mkn 501 had on average a significantly harder soft x - ray spectrum than the crab nebula .",
    "the spectral variability of mkn 501 is below the asm s sensitivity .",
    "the distribution of the weekly values is consistent with a constant value ( reduced @xmath39 = 0.93 ) and so is that for the crab nebula ( reduced @xmath39 = 0.95 ) .    in order to calculate the @xmath40 values in erg @xmath5 s@xmath6",
    ", we use the knowledge of the flux of the crab nebula . here",
    "we face the problem that there is still a disagreement of up to 25 % between the measured normalization constants of the crab spectrum from different experiments although there is perfect agreement in the spectral index .",
    "the discrepancy seems to stem from not very well understood systematic differences between the detectors ( see the discussion in pravdo , angelini & harding @xcite ) .",
    "we use the two most extreme recent measurements of the differential photon flux of the crab nebula together with the crab pulsar ( pulse - averaged ) and take their average as our normalization and their difference as the systematic error of this quantity . from pravdo & serlemitsos ( @xcite )",
    "we get at 5.2 kev a flux of ( 0.236 @xmath41 0.006 ) photons  @xmath5s@xmath6kev@xmath6 , while from pravdo , angelini & harding ( @xcite ) we get ( 0.302 @xmath41 0.001 ) photons  @xmath5s@xmath6kev@xmath6 .",
    "the average of these values corresponds to a differential energy flux of @xmath42 where the systematic error is the difference between the averaged values divided by 2 .",
    "the statistical errors of the two measurements are negligible .",

    "the hard x - ray fluxes were measured using the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) onboard the cgro satellite .",

    "several months are usually needed to obtain a statistically significant flux from mkn 501 with batse , but intense daily flares can be seen , and the overall high state of 1997 allowed useful measurements in each weekly interval even outside the flares .    the source is measured only when it sets and rises from behind the earth . since two such occultations occur per spacecraft orbit ( roughly every 90 minutes ) , up to 32 independent flux measurements can be made per day",
    ". there exists , however , a wide variation in this number because of passage of the spacecraft through the south atlantic anomaly , telemetry gaps from loss of tdrss contact , and other events , which occur randomly relative to the mkn 501 steps . for the data shown here between 61 and 211 measurements went into an individual weekly point .",
    "each measurement lasts about 8 seconds giving a duty cycle of about 0.2% . in a 7 day time bin during the period discussed in this paper ,",
    "batse observes of the order of @xmath48 photons from the source ( more during the flares ) .",
    "the fluxes are integrated between 20 and 200 kev , and are calculated by folding the measured counts through the batse detector response assuming a differential source powerlaw spectrum of index -2.0 .",
    "the -2.0 spectrum is the best fit to the flare measured on mjd 50550 - 51 ( between 20 and 1000 kev ) .",
    "spectra for other time intervals were also calculated and were consistent with -2.0 .",
    "uncertainties of 10  % in the spectral index during flare times , larger outside , make spectral variability difficult to assess for this source , so that the index of -2.0 was used for each weekly interval .",
    "fluxes were calculated for smaller energy bands but the single 20 - 200 kev ( median energy 36.4 kev ) point for each interval is the most useful outside intense flares .",
    "seven of the weekly averages are not statistically significant , and one period shows a @xmath49 deficit .",
    "these eight points are inconsistent with a zero - level flux at the 99 % confidence level .",
    "the seven low but positive points are inconsistent with a zero - flux level at the 98 - 99 % confidence level and are well fit by a constant flux of @xmath50 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 , implying that a flux is present which is below the sensitivity of the batse instrument in weekly integrations .",
    "an analysis of 30 blank fields on the sky shows that with 100 weekly integrations for each field one can not distinguish ( using an f - test ) between a zero - flux level and the weighted mean of the weekly averages for any of the 30 fields .",
    "this implies that systematic effects are not responsible for the excess seen in the low points and that a flux is indeed present .",
    "for this reason these low but positive values have been included as detections in the multiwavelength fits .",

    "thus , for the purpose of a spectral variability study , the statistical errors are those which actually determine the uncertainty in the differences of the spectral shape between different measurements .",

    "to each weekly sed we fit the blazar jet model described in detail by bttcher et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the model assumes that isolated components ( blobs ) of relativistic pair plasma , which are assumed to be spherical in the co - moving frame , are injected instantaneously into the jet , and follows the self - consistent evolution of the particle and radiation spectra as the blob moves outward along the jet , taking into account all relevant radiation , cooling , and absorption mechanisms : synchrotron radiation , synchrotron self - absorption , synchrotron self - compton scattering , external compton scattering of direct accretion disk radiation , @xmath1-@xmath1 absorption and pair production intrinsic to the source .",

    "the filling factor is given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the blob radius in the co - moving frame and @xmath68 is the bulk lorentz factor of the blobs . even if the filling factor is close to unity , it is a reasonable approximation to assume that the blobs do not interact with each other because the synchrotron and ssc radiation produced within the jet are isotropic in the comoving frame so that most of the radiation escapes to the sides without interaction with the rest of the jet .    as mentioned in the introduction , extreme hbls like mkn  501 or mkn  421",
    "are generally well described by a pure ssc model .",
    "a simple analytic estimate shows that the observed tev @xmath1-ray spectrum can not plausibly be produced by comptonization of radiation from an accretion disk around the putative supermassive black hole in the center of mrk  501 : the spectrum emitted by an optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk is reasonably well approximated by a blackbody spectrum whose temperature , for a black hole mass of @xmath69 , yields an average photon energy of the disk radiation of @xmath70 .",
    "if external comptonization is to be efficient in competition with the synchrotron self - compton process , the blob has to be rather close to the accretion disk , or a significant fraction of the disk photons has to be rescattered into the jet by surrounding material , so that the bulk of disk photons enters the blob from the side and is blue shifted by a factor of @xmath71 into the blob rest frame .",
    "thus , due to the strong reduction of the klein - nishina cross section for @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the photon energy in the comoving frame ) , no significant radiative output at ( observer s frame ) energies @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the doppler factor ) , corresponding to @xmath76  gev , will be produced by external comptonization , ruling out this process to explain the observed high - energy spectrum extending to tev energies .",
    "if the high - energy spectrum in the @xmath77  gev regime is produced by the ssc process , then the level of ssc radiation at 1  gev may be estimated by @xmath78 where @xmath79  tev is the energy of the @xmath40 peak in the high - energy part of the spectrum and @xmath80 is the spectral index of the injected electron spectrum . inserting a typical value of @xmath81 and @xmath82 ,",
    "this yields @xmath83 , which is already close to the maximum ever observed of @xmath84 . in reality , the ssc spectrum is not a straight power - law below @xmath85 , but shows a gradual turnover so that the actual ssc flux at 1  gev is substantially higher than the above estimate , leaving little room for an additional eic contribution . for our fitting procedure , we are thus using a simplified version of our jet simulation code , in which the photon output ( but not the electron cooling ) from comptonization of accretion disk radiation is neglected .",
    "these simulations properly account for the self - consistent cooling of the electron population and @xmath0 absorption and pair production in the blob . in the simulations , the exact , angle - averaged synchrotron spectrum of an isotropic electron population as given by crusius & schlickeiser ( @xcite )",
    "is used .",

    "we therefore construct a three - dimensional mesh of simulations in parameter space , with the electron density @xmath86 , the high - energy cutoff @xmath87 and the spectral index @xmath80 of the injected electron spectrum as parameters which are free to vary on the grid points .",
