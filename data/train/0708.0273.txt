    "one of the fundamental problems in the classification of complex surfaces is to find a new family of simply connected surfaces of general type with @xmath0 .",
    "although a large number of non - simply connected complex surfaces of general type with @xmath6 have been known  @xcite , simply connected surfaces of general type with @xmath0 are little known except barlow surface  @xcite .",
    "recently , the second author constructed a simply connected symplectic @xmath3-manifold with @xmath7 and @xmath8 using a rational blow - down surgery  @xcite , and then y. lee and the second author constructed a family of simply connected , minimal , complex surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath9 by modifying park s symplectic @xmath3-manifold  @xcite .",
    "after this construction , it has been a natural question whether one can find a new family of surfaces of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath10 using the same technique .",
    "the aim of this article is to give an affirmative answer for the question above .",
    "precisely , we are able to construct a simply connected , minimal , complex surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath11 using a rational blow - down surgery and a @xmath2-gorenstein smoothing theory developed in  @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient for the construction of @xmath11 case is to find a right rational surface @xmath12 which contains several disjoint chains of curves representing the resolution graphs of special quotient singularities .",
    "once we have a right candidate @xmath12 for @xmath11 , the remaining argument is parallel to that of @xmath13 case appeared in  @xcite .",
    "that is , we contract these chains of curves from the rational surface @xmath12 to produce a projective surface @xmath14 with special quotient singularities .",
    "and then we prove that the singular surface @xmath14 has a @xmath2-gorenstein smoothing and the general fiber @xmath15 of the @xmath2-gorenstein smoothing is a simply connected minimal surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the main result of this article is the following .",
    "[ thm - main ] there exists a simply connected , minimal , complex surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    by using different pencils and fibrations ,",
    "we provide more examples of simply connected minimal complex surfaces of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath11 in .",
    "furthermore , we also construct a new simply connected closed symplectic @xmath3-manifold with @xmath4 and @xmath5 using the same technique as in section 3 .",
    "[ thm - main2 ] there exists a simply connected symplectic @xmath3-manifold with @xmath4 and @xmath5 which is homeomorphic , but not diffeomorphic , to a rational surface @xmath16 .",

    "one way to approach this problem is to use @xmath2-gorenstein smoothing theory as above .",
    "but , since the cohomology @xmath17 is not zero in this case , it is hard to determine whether there exists a @xmath2-gorenstein smoothing .",

    "then we construct a new smooth @xmath3-manifold @xmath144 , called a _ @xmath145generalized@xmath146 rational blow - down _ of @xmath143 , by replacing @xmath134 with the rational ball @xmath147 .",
    "note that this process is well - defined , that is , a new smooth @xmath3-manifold @xmath148 is uniquely determined ( up to diffeomorphism ) from @xmath143 because each diffeomorphism of @xmath149 extends over the rational ball @xmath147 .",
    "we call this a _ rational blow - down _ surgery .",
    "furthermore , m. symington proved that a rational blow - down manifold @xmath148 admits a symplectic structure in some cases .",

    "now we perform a rational blow - down surgery of the surface @xmath12 obtained in the main construction .",
    "note that the surface @xmath12 contains four disjoint configurations - @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "let us decompose the surface @xmath12 into @xmath153 then the @xmath3-manifold , say @xmath154 , obtained by rationally blowing down along the four configurations can be decomposed into @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the corresponding rational balls .",
    "we claim that    [ thm-3.1 ] the rational blow - down @xmath154 of the surface @xmath12 in the main construction is a simply connected closed symplectic @xmath3-manifold with @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "since all the curves lying in the configurations @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath152 are symplectically ( in fact , holomorphically ) embedded @xmath135-spheres , symington s result  @xcite guarantees the existence of a symplectic structure on the rational blow - down @xmath3-manifold @xmath154 .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to check that @xmath161 and @xmath162 .    it remains to prove the simple connectivity of @xmath154 : since @xmath163 is surjective ( @xcite ,  5 ) , by van - kampen theorem , it suffices to show that @xmath164 .",
    "first , note that @xmath12 and all four configurations @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath152 are all simply connected .",
    "hence , applying van - kampen theorem on @xmath12 inductively , we get @xmath165 here @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 are induced homomorphisms by inclusions @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 respectively .",

    "that is , they satisfy either @xmath200 or @xmath201 ( depending on orientations ) for some path @xmath202 , because one is homotopic to the other in @xmath203 .",
    "hence , by combining two facts above , for example , we get @xmath204 . since the two numbers @xmath205 and @xmath206 are relatively prime , the element @xmath207 should be trivial .",
    "so the relation @xmath208 implies the triviality of @xmath196 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath196 and @xmath197 are also conjugate to each other for @xmath209 , the triviality of @xmath196 implies that @xmath210 and @xmath211 are trivial .",

    "we first prove that @xmath15 satisfies @xmath0 and @xmath11 : since @xmath12 is a nonsingular rational surface and @xmath14 has only rational singularities , @xmath14 is a projective surface with @xmath248 .",
