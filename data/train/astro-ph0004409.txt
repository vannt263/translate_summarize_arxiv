    "our solar system is traveling through a low - density ( @xmath2 ) , warm ( @xmath3k ) , partially ionized gas cloud called the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) ( lallement et al .",
    "1996 ) with a diameter of about 4  pc ( redfield & linsky 2000 ) . near the lic",
    "are similar clouds that give rise to absorption features with different velocities ( gry 1996 ; lallement 1996 ) , known collectively as the local interstellar medium ( lism ) . from the available evidence ,",
    "the physical conditions in the lism clouds are only sightly different from those of the lic ( linsky 1996 ; ferlet 1999 ) .",
    "presently , we do not have a clear understanding of the physical processes that are responsible for high fractional ionization of helium in the lism . from observations that @xmath4 ( dupuis et al .",
    "1995 ) , along with the knowledge that @xmath5 in all forms , it is evident that he is usually slightly more ionized than h. also , helium shows less variability in how strongly it is ionized from one region to the next ( wolff , koester , & lallement 1999 ) .",
    "while the euv radiation from white dwarf and other stars can explain the observed fractional ionization of h ( vallerga 1998 ) , these sources do not produce enough photons with energies above 24.6  ev to explain the ionization of he . to resolve this problem ,",
    "two main proposals have been offered .",
    "one is that the lism is not in a steady - state condition ; it is returning from a much more highly ionized state produced by an energetic event in the recent past ( @xmath6 ) , such as the flash from a nearby supernova ( reynolds 1986 ; frisch & slavin 1996 ) or its shock wave ( lyu & bruhweiler 1996 ) .",
    "the other possibility is that the ionization of he is maintained in a steady state by the diffuse euv radiation arising from conductive interfaces between the cloud edges and the surrounding , hot medium at @xmath7k ( slavin 1989 ; slavin & frisch 1998 ) , or , alternatively , by recombination radiation from highly ionized but cooled gases that might surround us ( breitschwerdt & schmutzler 1994 ) .",
    "sofia & jenkins ( 1998 ) have proposed that the apparent abundances of the neutral forms of n , o and ar , elements that are generally very lightly depleted in the interstellar medium ( if at all ) , can help to unravel the mystery of the he ionization .",
    "uv absorption lines in the spectra of white dwarf stars present good opportunities for studying these abundances in the lism , since most of the brighter objects are well removed from major gas clouds elsewhere and remain immersed within a `` local bubble '' ( diam .",
    "@xmath8  pc ) of very hot , low density material surrounding the nearby cloud complex ( cox & reynolds 1987 ; sfeir et al .",
    "we report here on initial spectra of four white dwarf stars taken with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) ( moos et al .",
    "2000 ; sahnow et al .",
    "2000 ) taken at a resolution of @xmath9 (   [ obs]@xmath10[results ] ) , and we interpret the findings in the light of the sofia & jenkins proposal to obtain a better understanding on how the lism is ionized (  [ interpretation ] ) .",
    "the stars , their locations in the sky , estimates for @xmath11(h  i ) arising from the lic only , and the wavelength ranges observed by fuse are summarized in table  [ stars ] . all of the stars are at distances that range between approximately 50@xmath1080  pc . the values of @xmath12 ( cf .",

    "in addition , for some stars we recorded two ionized forms of nitrogen , n  ii and n  iii . while the n  iii feature conceivably might arise from photospheric absorption , we see no evidence of stronger absorption from n  iii in an excited fine - structure level  in the absence of saturation this feature would be twice as strong as the one we observed if all of the n  iii absorption came from the star s photosphere . two spectral segments for one of the stars , wd  @xmath0 , are shown in fig .",

    "our noise estimate was derived from the sizes of flux deviations from the adopted continuum level and thus included the effect of counting statistical fluctuations and small variations in the response of the detector ( flat - field corrections were not made ) .",

    "white dwarf stars can have narrow , photospheric features that could interfere with or masquerade as interstellar lines .",
    "this problem is probably more severe for the stars gd  394 and wd  @xmath0 , which are known to be metal rich ( wolff et al . 1998 ) .",
    "for example , the 952.3@xmath61  feature of n  i in wd  @xmath0 is probably enhanced by a stellar feature , since the observed equivalent width is far higher than those of other transitions of comparable strength .",

    "the deficiency of ar  i for all four stars is of order @xmath91  dex .",
    "we adopt the argument presented by sofia & jenkins ( 1998 ) that this is not caused by ar depleting onto the surfaces of dust grains , but rather that neutral ar is more easily photoionized than h. if some photons with @xmath92ev can penetrate a region , the h can be partially ionized . under these circumstances the ar ( i.p .",
    "=  15.76@xmath61ev ) should be much more fully ionized because its photoionization cross section is about ten times that of h over a broad range of energies .",
    "n  i and o  i also have photoionization cross sections that are larger than that of h  i , but the ionization fractions of n and o are coupled to that of h via resonant charge exchange reactions . for o  ii ,",
    "the rate coefficient for charge exchange with h  i ( @xmath93 ) ( field & steigman 1971 ) is much larger than the coefficient of recombination with free electrons ( @xmath94 for @xmath95k ) , so the coupling of the o and h ionization fractions is very strong , unless there is appreciable ionization of o to higher stages .",
    "n  ii has a charge exchange rate that is only about twice the recombination coefficient ( butler & dalgarno 1979 ) , so in regions where @xmath96 , n can start to behave more like ar and show a deficiency of its neutral form .    to illustrate the expected deviations for o  i / h  i , n  i / h  i and ar  i / h  i away from the condition where all three elements are fully neutral , fig .  [ calc_def ]",
    "shows the results of our calculations of photoionization equilibria for various depths of shielding by neutral h and he within a cloud .",
    "the detailed equations and how they are solved are described by sofia & jenkins ( 1998 ) . at any point within the cloud the radiation field caused by hot stars",
    "was assumed to be stronger or weaker than vallerga s ( 1998 ) combined stellar fluxes by a factor @xmath97[\\sigma(\\lambda)_{\\rm h~i } + 0.07\\sigma(\\lambda)_{\\rm he~i}]\\}$ ] , where the @xmath98 s are the photoionization cross sections .",

    "( 2000 ) failed to observe these lines at a flux level far below the predicted one .",
    "this probably happens because fe is depleted onto dust grains . ]",
    "turning back to the observations , the results shown in table  [ col_dens ] indicate that n and o are deficient , but for g191-b2b and wd  @xmath1 not as strongly as ar .",
    "a mild deficiency in n can be understood if the hydrogen is mostly ionized , as is expected near the boundary of a cloud ( see fig .",

    "the underabundances of o are harder to explain , although they are reduced in magnitude by 0.17  dex if one adopts as a standard the o / h found in the ism by meyer , et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( 8.50 on a logarithmic scale with h  =  12.00 ) rather than the value of o / h in b stars .",
    "also , in view of the possibly large uncertainties in @xmath100 ( except for g191-b2b ) , it may be better to adopt o as the reference element instead of h when we investigate the behavior of n  i and ar  i.    for gd  394 and wd  @xmath0 , it is difficult to understand why the deficiencies of n  i are not much weaker than the corresponding ones of ar  i. one possible explanation could be that a conduction front is not the dominant source of high energy radiation , but instead the ionization of n and ar might be strongly influenced by @xmath101ev photons arising from recombinations to he  ii , which could conceivably be the dominant form of diffuse euv radiation ( breitschwerdt , 2000 ) if much of the material in the local bubble has cooled to @xmath102k but has not yet recombined ( breitschwerdt & schmutzler 1994 ) . over much of this energy range ,",
    "n  i is more easily ionized than ar  i if recombinations with free electrons are more important than charge exchange with h  i [ see fig .",
    "3 of sofia & jenkins ( 1998 ) ] .",
    "it will be interesting to see if detailed calculations confirm this conjecture .",
    "a flux of ionizing photons with e  @xmath103  24.6  ev and sufficient intensity to create the steady - state ionization of he in the lism has not yet been observed directly , but our observations showing a significant reduction in ar  i favor its existence .",
    "if , by contrast , we had found a normal amount of ar  i , we might have concluded that the gas was probably more highly ionized in the past and has not yet fully recombined . here , a near equality of ar  i / h  i to the expected cosmic ratio would have arisen from their virtually identical recombination coefficients .",
    "ionizations to levels higher than the singly ionized forms are not important in this picture , since their recombination rates are significantly faster ( @xmath104 ) .",
