    "<S> we analyse the statistical properties of genealogical trees in a neutral model of a closed population with sexual reproduction and non - overlapping generations . by reconstructing the genealogy of an individual from the population evolution </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the distribution of ancestors appearing more than once in a given tree . after a transient time </S>",
    "<S> , the probability of repetition follows , up to a rescaling , a stationary distribution which we calculate both numerically and analytically . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution exhibits a universal shape with a non - trivial power law which can be understood by an exact , though simple , renormalization calculation . </S>",
    "<S> some real data on human genealogy illustrate the problem , which is relevant to the study of the real degree of diversity in closed interbreeding communities .    </S>",
    "<S> modern man appeared on earth some @xmath0 years ago @xcite . at that time , </S>",
    "<S> few social groups totalling several thousands of individuals were occupying small settlements , most probably in africa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays , we are faced with about @xmath1 human beings on earth , whose lineages could be in principle traced back to that time . </S>",
    "<S> each human being has two parents , four grandparents , and in general @xmath2 ancestors in the @xmath3th upper generation . </S>",
    "<S> going backwards in time until the first group of anatomically modern _ homo sapiens _ </S>",
    "<S> some 4000 generations ago we should find @xmath4 ancestors in each genealogical tree . </S>",
    "<S> however , the total human population at those early times was probably of a few thousands only ! </S>",
    "<S> the answer to this apparent paradox is simple : a given individual appears more than once in a genealogical tree @xcite , even in very distant branches , indicating that many of the ancestors were in fact close relatives . </S>",
    "<S> a repeated individual generates a whole repeated branch in the tree , and the further we move into the past , the more frequent the repetitions will be . </S>",
    "<S> this is the result of mating inside a finite population , the size of which sets an upper bound to the maximal number of ancestors for a given individual .    </S>",
    "<S> these repetitions are particularly apparent when we are faced with a small closed interbreeding population . </S>",
    "<S> royal genealogy provides us with a nice example , since nobles usually married within their own castes . as an illustration to the problem , we have analysed the repetitions in the genealogical tree of the english king edward iii ( 1312 - 1377 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it contains almost @xmath5 individuals , some of which appear more than once ( and up to six times ) in his tree . </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 the function @xmath6 , defined as the quotient between the number @xmath7 of ancestors which appear @xmath8 times in the tree and the total number of different ancestors @xmath9 , @xmath10 .    we study here the statistics of repetitions in genealogical trees as a function of the population size and the generation in the past that we are looking at . </S>",
    "<S> the question that we are addressing can be put in the more general context of genetic diversity @xcite . in fact , an important factor in the variability of natural populations is the diversity displayed , in the genealogical history of every individual , by his ancestors themselves , and by their weights in the present genome . here </S>",
    "<S> we calculate these weights in a simple neutral model , with no selection , no change in the population size and no geographical isolation . </S>",
    "<S> possible effects of these on genealogies and genetic diversities are discussed in @xcite .    we have started by performing numerical simulations of a simple neutral model of a closed population evolving under sexual reproduction with non - overlapping generations . in our model </S>",
    "<S> the population size is fixed to be @xmath11 for all generations . </S>",
    "<S> the population is equally divided into two groups , representing males and females . at every generation , </S>",
    "<S> we form heterosexual pairs at random and assign them a certain number of descendants according to a poisson distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by choosing for each male or each female a pair of parents at random in the previous generation @xcite . after a number @xmath12 of generations </S>",
    "<S> , the tree of each of the individuals in the youngest generation is reconstructed .    </S>",
    "<S> we have first calculated the distribution @xmath6 of repetitions in this model for a population @xmath13 and @xmath14 individuals . </S>",
    "<S> this might be a rough estimate of the number of noble people at the time of edward iii . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath15 generations , we compute the probability of repetitions in the whole tree ( notice that in the real world generations often overlap and thus the same person might be found in different generations ; this possibility is absent in our model ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result of our simulations is compared with the real data displayed in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe an acceptable agreement , although we should say that the distribution @xmath6 depends rather strongly on @xmath12 and @xmath11 and that the agreement is often worse for other reasonable choices of these two parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also measured the probability of repetitions @xmath16 at every past generation @xmath17 , that is , the probability that any individual at generation @xmath18 in the past appears @xmath8 times in the tree of an individual at generation @xmath19 ( @xmath20 corresponds to the parents , @xmath21 to the grandparents and so on ; note that @xmath22 is simply the probability that an individual is not present in a tree after @xmath18 generations ) . in the first few generations </S>",
    "<S> ( parents , grandparents ... ) , if the population size @xmath11 is large , the probability of finding an individual more than once in a tree is very small . as a consequence @xmath16 decreases with @xmath8 when @xmath18 is small . </S>",
    "<S> going further in the past , at some point two  brothers \" will appear in the tree of an individual , and from then on these two branches will coincide . from then on , </S>",
    "<S> more and more repetitions will occur .    the distribution @xmath16 is shown in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> it changes its shape during a transient period of the order of @xmath23 generations . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that an important difference between @xmath6 shown in figure 1 and @xmath16 is that for @xmath24 we counted only those individuals present in one particular genealogical tree whereas for @xmath25 we count the whole population at generation @xmath18 in the past . ) clearly , we have @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in figure 2 </S>",
    "<S> we see for @xmath28 the function @xmath16 for different generations before and after reaching the stationary shape . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath18 small , @xmath16 decreases with @xmath8 , meaning that repetitions are very unprobable . as @xmath18 increases , the number of repetitions increases and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 exhibits a maximum and a shape which becomes stationary .    if we rescale the distribution @xmath16 by plotting as in figure 3 the distribution @xmath29 versus the weight @xmath30 all the distributions of figure 2 ( after a transient period ) collapse on a single stationary function . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 represents the function @xmath31 for several values of @xmath18 after the transient period obtained for a population of @xmath32 individuals . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the left tail of @xmath31 is a power law , @xmath33 , and a least squares fit to our numerical results in the domain @xmath34 returns @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the exponent @xmath36 , one can accurately measure the moments of @xmath37 of @xmath38 as well as the fraction @xmath39 of the total population in the oldest generation which is absent from a given genealogical tree . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 contains our numerical estimates for @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows also the first moments of the distribution @xmath31 . as can be seen , even when the number of potential ancestors in the tree is much larger than the number of individuals in the population , not all of those give contributions to the present . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the proportion of individuals without descendents reaches a fixed value , @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> the distribution @xmath31 can be understood analytically by the following argument : if we consider the genealogical tree of an individual , say individual @xmath41 at the @xmath19th generation , the weights @xmath42 of his ancestors can be traced back according to the following algorithm . from ( [ pw],[w ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath43 for @xmath41 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> then the weights of the ancestors at generation @xmath46 in the past , with @xmath47 , are given by @xmath48    when @xmath11 is large , the probability @xmath49 that an individual at generation @xmath50 in the past has @xmath51 children at generation @xmath18 becomes a poisson distribution @xmath52    now if for large @xmath11 we consider that the weights of the children of any given individual are uncorrelated , ( this can be viewed as an approximation , but in fact , by calculating pair correlations between the weights in our model , one can show that for large enough @xmath11 this approximation becomes exact ) , we obtain from ( [ eq1],[eq2 ] ) that any weight at generation @xmath53 is the sum of @xmath51 i.i.d . </S>",
    "<S> weights at generation @xmath18 with @xmath51 itself randomly chosen according to ( [ eq2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> . then if @xmath54 is the generating function of the weights at generation @xmath18 in the past , @xmath55 it follows from ( 3 ) ( and the fact that for large @xmath11 the @xmath56 are uncorrelated ) that it satisfies @xmath57^k = e^{-2 + 2 g_{n_g } ( \\lambda /2 ) } \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] this recursion has the form of a renormalization group transformation . </S>",
    "<S> together with the initial condition @xmath58 it determines all the generating functions @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath59 , the generating function converges to a limit @xmath60 solution of @xmath61    all the informations on the shape of the stationary solution @xmath31 are contained in the solution of ( [ eq3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one can expand @xmath60 solution of ( [ eq3 ] ) in power series and find that @xmath62 this leads to @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and so on . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that @xmath67 is not determined by ( [ eq3 ] ) but this is an immediate consequence of the initial condition ( [ eq4 ] ) . ) </S>",
    "<S> one can also determine the fraction @xmath68 of individuals with no descendence ( that is the probability that @xmath69 ) by @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , @xmath70 is the solution of @xmath71 and this gives @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> the power law @xmath33 at small @xmath42 can also be easily understood from ( [ eq3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath73 for small @xmath42 , one can write that as @xmath74 @xmath75 and equation ( [ eq3 ] ) gives ( by the standard renormalization argument used to calculate exponents by linearization around a fixed point and which consists in writing the compensation of the singularities proportional to @xmath76 on both sides of ( [ eq3 ] ) ) that @xmath77 in excellent agreement with the results of the simulation </S>",
    "<S> . other properties of the stationary distribution @xmath31 could in principle be extracted from ( [ eq3 ] ) but this would require more complicated mathematical developments .    in this work , we have shown that a simple neutral model of sexual reproduction with non - overlapping generations leads to a universal distribution of the weights of ancestors in genealogical trees . this universal distribution ( more precisely its generating function ) </S>",
    "<S> is the fixed point ( [ eq3 ] ) of a simple renormalization equation ( [ eq5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath36 of the power law observed for small weights can be calculated exactly .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result is that if we go very far in the past , about 80% of the ( adult ) population appears in the genealogical tree of every individual . </S>",
    "<S> if the weights of these ancestors represent how often they appear in this tree , these weights have a stationary probability distribution which is universal ( i.e. independent of the generation and of the population size ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of extensions of the present work which , in our opinion , are worth pursuing . first , a more complete description of @xmath31 , in particular the large @xmath42 behavior , could be extracted from ( [ eq3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we wish to perform a better approximation to real genealogy , the possibility of overlaps between generations or of changes in the population size should be included . </S>",
    "<S> one can try to measure the distribution of lengths of segments in simple models @xcite for the evolution of chromosomes to see whether a power law in the length distribution is present there too . </S>",
    "<S> one could also investigate how our results would be modified by choosing instead of ( [ eq2 ] ) a non - poissonian distribution of offsprings . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , it would be interesting to consider the genealogical trees of several individuals to see how the repetitions on different trees are correlated @xcite .    with a little more imagination </S>",
    "<S> , one can construct other universality classes , by allowing the number @xmath78 of parents of each individual to be arbitrary , instead of @xmath79 in our earthy world . </S>",
    "<S> for general @xmath78 , the fixed point equation ( [ eq3 ] ) would become @xmath80 $ ] . no need to say that one might then try to expand the distribution @xmath31 , the fixed point @xmath68 or the exponent @xmath36 in powers of @xmath81 for @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , one can show @xcite that the case of an exponentially increasing ( or decreasing ) population size with @xmath79 parents for each individual is equivalent , as long as @xmath60 is concerned , to the case of a population of constant size with a number of parents @xmath78 which depends on the exponential growth rate of the population .    apart from the potential application of our results to population genetics and evolutionary biology , the model of evolution studied here is connected to a number of problems of current interest in physics . </S>",
    "<S> first , the random assignment of the parents of individuals at each generation is very reminiscent of a problem of repartition of constraints introduced recently @xcite to describe granular materials , with a recursion similar to ( [ eq1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> graphs which locally look like trees but where large loops responsible for cooperative effects are present have attracted a lot of interest in the theory of disordered systems ( spin glasses , localization ) @xcite-@xcite,@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , the model studied here gives through ( [ eq5],[eq3 ] ) a very simple and pedagogical example of a problem with a non - trivial exponent , which can be solved exactly by a discrete renormalization transformation . </S>",
    "<S> one could try to see whether the oscillations @xcite which usually accompany such discrete renormalization transformations are present here too . </S>"
