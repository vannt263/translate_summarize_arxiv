    "since the first demonstration of cold atom interferometric inertial sensors @xcite in the 1990s , light - pulse atom interferometers ( ais ) have become very stable and extremely accurate sensors for the measurements of fundamental constants such as gravitational constant @xcite or the fine structure constant @xcite , and inertial forces like gravity acceleration @xcite , earth s gravity gradient @xcite or rotations @xcite finding variety of applications in geodesy , geophysics , metrology , inertial navigation among others .",
    "in addition , high sensitivity ais have become promising candidates for laboratory tests of general relativity ( gr ) @xcite especially for gravitational - waves ( gw ) detection @xcite , short - range forces @xcite and tests of the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) @xcite .",
    "for all applications , high resolution measurements must take into account high order terms in the phase shift to increase the sensors accuracy and sensitivity .",
    "phase shift calculations in light - pulse ais in the presence of multiple gravito - inertial fields have already been deeply investigated @xcite . however , the phase shift formulations are not always convenient when one wants to use them for practical applications such as the development of atomic sensors that could be selectively sensitive to a particular inertial field such as a rotation , acceleration as well as cross terms . in this letter",
    "we derive a novel formulation for phase shift calculations in @xmath0 light - pulse ais considering the case of two - path interferences in the presence of multiple gravito - inertial fields .",
    "the formulation presented in this letter could be of practical interest both for the understanding of contribution of inertial terms to the phase shift , as well as for applications to the development of selective inertial sensors .",
    "this simple and exact formulation is obtained starting from an exact analytical phase shift formula valid for any pulse sequence and taking into account gravity , gravity gradient and rotations @xcite.the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : calculations ] we introduce the general framework of our calculations and give a simple formulation of the phase shift up to @xmath4 dependences .",
    "we explicitely derive the phase shift up to order @xmath5 in the presence of multiple gravito - inertial fields . in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we give a physical analysis of the leading coefficients of the phase shift obtained with our formulation . in section  [ sec : photonrecoil ] we consider the effects of wave vector change and photon recoil on the atomic phase shift in the presence of inertial forces . in section  [ sec : application ] we give the expression of the total phase shift for any n - light pulse ai according to our formulation .",
    "we then apply our formula to the case of a mach - zehnder atomic interferometer and evaluate the phase shift terms of our compact cold rubidium atom gravimeter .",
    "we show that our results are consistent with previous work of antoine et al . , dubetsky et al . , and wolf et al .",
    "@xcite . in section  [ sec : originalai ] we demonstrate the benefit of our formulation when searching for a particular selective inertial atomic sensor .",
    "we give theoritical examples of n - light - pulse ais dedicated to the photon recoil measurement .",
    "we consider @xmath0-light - pulse ais in which atoms undergo two - photon transitions ( raman transition or bragg pulse ) and where the two laser beams are counter - propagating or co - propagating with pulse sequences only separated in time .",
    "we consider ais in the limit of short pulses .",
    "a two - photon transition is treated as a single photon transition with effective frequency @xmath6 and effective wave vector @xmath7 corresponding to the difference in frequency and wave vector respectively . in our formalism , @xmath8-photon bragg transitions ( with @xmath9 being the bragg diffraction order , @xmath10 ) , could be considered by simply giving to the effective wave vector a magnitude @xmath11 . in the following calculations , we will consider @xmath12 , unless specified .",
    "thus , a bragg transition will be equivalent to a raman transition if one does not matter about the quantum internal state .",
    "we will precise wether the internal quantum state changes ( raman pulse ) or not ( bragg pulse ) if necessary .",
    "we first consider ais for which light pulses are all equally separated by time @xmath3,(extension to the case of an arbitrary pulse sequence is possible ( see section 3  [ sec : arbitrarypulse ] ) ) .",
    "the ais are cut into as many slices as there are interactions.hence , the time of the @xmath13-th light - pulse is defined as : @xmath14 the effective frequencies and wave vectors will be considered different for each pulse in order to compensate for doppler shift . hence , the effective laser frequency is chirped linearly so as to maintain the resonance condition for each light - pulse as it is in the case of gravity , and resonance condition , will be satisfied.the effective wave vector @xmath15 and frequency @xmath16 of the two - photon transition of the @xmath13-th light pulse are defined as:@xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 accounts for the difference in effective wave - vector and @xmath21 is the frequency difference due to the laser chirp , independent of the laser pulse number @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , @xmath20 is equal to zero when chirping symmetrically two counter propagative laser beams , whereas @xmath21 is not .",
    "we introduce an effective laser phase : @xmath22      any of the ai s that we consider will consist of time sequences of two kinds of pulses @xcite :    * @xmath23 pulses that will play the role of matter - wave beam splitters . * @xmath24 pulses that will act as matter - wave reflectors ( or mirrors )",
    ".    one path of an @xmath0-pulse ai is described by a vector @xmath25 where @xmath26 accounts for the angular splitting induced by the atom - light interaction at time @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 for an upward and downward momentum transfer @xmath30 respectively , and where @xmath31 is along the @xmath32 direction .",
    "when the atom remains in the same momentum state , @xmath33 .",
    "an example of pulse beam - splitter ( i.e. @xmath23 pulse ) and mirror pulse ( i.e. @xmath24 pulse ) are given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     at time @xmath34 ; ( a ) beam - splitter pulse : the atom is put in a coherent superposition of two momentum states ; ( b ) mirror pulse : the atom s momentum state is changed with momentum @xmath35 .",
    "solid and dashed lines correspond to two different momentum states correponding to the same internal quantum state ( bragg pulse ) or different internal quantum states ( raman transition ) .",
    "the two paths are described with vector @xmath36 and @xmath37 . ]",
    "we will consider two - path ais .",
    "each path is described by a vector @xmath38 ( upper path ) and @xmath39 ( lower path ) which takes into account the two - photon pulse sequence : @xmath40 with @xmath41 an integer ( @xmath2).we introduce : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a vandermonde matrix with coefficient @xmath44 and where @xmath45 is the difference of interaction between two paths at time @xmath27 . as an example , we give in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the case of the well - known two - path mach - zehnder atomic interferometer , and focusing on one exit port of the interferometer one gets for the upper path @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "consequently one finds @xmath48 .",
    "one could have chosen the other exit port of the interferometer which would not affect @xmath49 .",
    ".,height=226 ]      the phase shift in a light - pulse ai is often calculated in three steps . in a first step one identifies the different arms of the interferometer and calculates the phase shift due to atom - light interaction and free propagation of the atoms along each independent arm .",
    "in a second step one makes the difference between the phase shift obtained in each arm . finally , in a third step , a phase shift due to spatial separation of the atoms is added . to calculate the total phase shift one can use the feynman path integral formalism @xcite , considering atoms as plane waves .",
    "one limitation of this approach is that it is difficult to perform when one wants to account for simultaneous gravito - inertial effects such as gravity , rotation , gravity gradient and their interplay , as addressed in this paper . in this context , the starting point of our approach is based on the atom optics @xmath50 formalism developed by bord @xcite .",
    "this method allows both to consider atoms as wave packets , as well as to calculate the exact interferometric phase shift arising from multiple inertial effects .      for any time - dependent hamiltonian at most quadratic in position @xmath32 and momentum @xmath51 , which is the case for essentially all atom interferometric applications ,",
    "the exact phase shift formula for a @xmath0-light - pulse ai with wave vector @xmath41 along the @xmath52 direction is @xcite : @xmath53 the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : phaseborde ] ) has two separate contributions .",
    "the first summation term accounts for the inertial phase shift , that we will denote @xmath54 with @xmath55 ( and @xmath56 ) being the position of the wave packet at time @xmath34 of the upper path ( and lower path ) respectively , and where one assumes no offset in the initial positions of the wave packet , @xmath57 .",
    "this inertial phase shift depends on the classical mid - point position of the atoms at time @xmath34 .",
    "the second summation term is a time - dependent laser phase shift that we will denote @xmath58 . according to ( @xmath59 )",
    "the time dependent laser phase shift for any ai consisting of @xmath0-light - pulse can be expressed as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 are defined in ( @xmath62).thus we will mainly focus on the inertial phase shift calculation . for simplicity we will first assume no wave vector change ( @xmath63 ) , as well as no photon recoil effect .",
    "these high order terms will be taken into account in section  [ sec : photonrecoil ] .",
    "thus , the absence of recoil effect leads to @xmath64 in equation ( [ eq : phaseborde ] ) which can be written : @xmath65 in our method , we calculate the inertial phase shift , by making a taylor expansion in power of @xmath3 of the @xmath32 position of the wave packet with respect to the first light - pulse ( @xmath66 ) of the interferometer , assuming @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69.after some algebra the inertial phase shift is given by : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is defined in equation ( [ eq : deltag]).one can rewrite @xmath72 considering the action of any gravito - inertial fields on the atoms located at position @xmath73 , leading to the final expression : @xmath74 where we introduce as a notation the function @xmath75 .",
    "this function depends on the atomic initial position @xmath76 and velocity @xmath77 , and any gravito - inertial forces experienced by the atoms . moreover , it is independent of the ai geometry",
    ". we will apply this novel formulation of the phase shift obtained in equation ( [ eq : dephasage2 ] ) in the next section .      in this section",
    "we use our formulation to derive the phase shift when the atom is submitted to simultaneous time independent gravito - inertial fields like gravity , gravity gradient and rotation .",
    "we consider the same two cases ( a and b ) treated in the previous work of @xcite.in case a , the ai is fixed to the earth frame @xmath78 , rotating with rotation rate @xmath79 with respect to to the inertial reference frame ( i - frame ) , @xmath80 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] ) . in case",
    "b , the ai is fixed to a rotating platform of rotation rate @xmath81 for convenience .",
    "( i - frame ) defined by the fixed stars having its origin at the center of the earth and earth reference frame @xmath78 with local coordinate system @xmath82 where the @xmath32-axis is chosen to point away from the earth center , with rotation rate components @xmath83 . ]    to give the phase shift for each case ( a and b ) , we calculate the @xmath75 functions of equation ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "for @xmath85 these functions simply correspond to initial atomic position @xmath86 , and velocity @xmath77 respectively .",
    "to calculate higher order derivatives ( @xmath87 ) we use the classical equations of atomic motion given by : @xmath88 with @xmath89 the relative acceleration , @xmath90 the coriolis acceleration and @xmath91 the centrifugal acceleration and where we have introduce gravity at position @xmath73 as : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the gravity gradient tensor with its origin taken at position @xmath94.in order to calculate @xmath75 ( @xmath87 ) , one has to perform time derivation of @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , one can notice that time derivation of @xmath96 is strictly depending on case a or b. in order to provide a unified treatment we introduce parameter @xmath97 to distinguish between both cases .",
    "assuming @xmath98 for case a , and @xmath99 for case b , one obtains : @xmath100 one interesting feature of equation ( @xmath101 ) is that it takes into account both cases @xmath102 and @xmath103 simultaneously . choosing @xmath99 , or @xmath98 and calculating successive higher order time derivatives using ( @xmath104 ) and its derivatives and substituting in equation ( @xmath84 )",
    "allows to calculate the global inertial phase shift for any @xmath0 light - pulse ais .",
    "considering the rotating earth frame , one can define @xmath105 as the initial velocity of the atoms and acceleration @xmath106 as the sum of gravity and centrifugal accelerations .",
    "one can now calculate the function @xmath107 up to order @xmath41.calculating the inertial phase shift up to terms proportional to @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) leads to : @xmath110 equation ( @xmath111 ) exhibits the total inertial phase shift to the second order in the time seperation beetween pulses . in this case , one can see that @xmath112 is only a function of constant acceleration @xmath113 , initial velocity @xmath114 and constant rotation @xmath79.in table [ tab : tab1 ] we extend the phase shift calculation up to terms proportional to @xmath115 for whatever the case is ( a or b ) . in this case , cross - terms between gravity gradient @xmath93 , acceleration @xmath113 and rotation @xmath79 appear in the phase shift expression .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     [ tab:8pulsesbis ]    these theoritical ai schemes consider perfect beam splitter pulses .",
    "however , practically , the use of non perfect beam splitters induce many two - wave interferences leading to spurious phase shifts and possible contrast loss  @xcite .",
    "this multiple two - wave interference effect is not treated with our theoritical framework .",
    "nevertheless , from a practical point of view , experimental strategies to mitigate this effect could be developped such as the use of a pushing beam at resonance with the atoms to suppress parasitic paths in the interferometer  @xcite .",
    "in this work we have presented a novel formulation of the phase shift in multipulse atom interferometers considering two - path interferences in the presence of multiple gravito - inertial fields",
    ". we showed , considering constant acceleration and rotation and starting from an exact phase shift formula obtained in @xcite , that coefficient in the leading terms of the phase shift up to @xmath1 dependences could be simply expressed as the product between a so - called vandermonde matrix , and a vector characterizing the two - photon pulse sequence of the ai.we showed that this formulation could be of practical interest when one wants to use atom interferometers as a selective sensor of some specific inertial field .",
    "as an application we presented theoritical examples of original ais that could be dedicated to photon recoil measurement independent of rotation , gravity , and gravity gradient .",
    "we therefore think that this formulation could benefit to the community.a noteworthy attribute of our work is that time dependent accelerations or rotations , could be easily included in our formulation , hence allowing to look for ai configurations where time dependent rotations would be minimized or suppressed as one knows their detrimental effects on atomic gradiometer performances @xcite . finally , multiple - beam atom interferometers have demonstrated to be of interest for precision measurements of physical quantities @xcite . therefore",
    ", a possible improvement of this work would be to consider the effect on the interferometer s phase shift of the greater number of interfering paths when dealing with multipulse scheme atom interferometers .",
    "we assume a @xmath116 pulse ai with @xmath117 .",
