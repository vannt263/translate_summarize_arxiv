    "hybrid junctions between inorganic components and organic molecules have been of great interest due to their potential applications in electronic devices @xcite , thermoelectrics @xcite , solar cells @xcite and optoelectronics @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the hybrid junctions , particularly the self - assembled monolayers ( sams ) have been intensively explored for thermal properties because of the discovery that the interfacial thermal conductance can be enhanced by more than a factor of four at room temperature simply by embedding the commonly assumed thermally insulating polymers ( alkane chains ) at the metal / dielectric interface @xcite .",
    "this enhancement can even be tuned over one order of magnitude by carefully varying the interfacial properties ( bond stiffness and mass ) with end - group chemistry @xcite .",
    "the observations of the influence of the interfacial properties on the interfacial thermal conductance diverge in the existing literature .",
    "one set of articles @xcite reports that the conductance increases monotonically with the bonding strength .",
    "this observation is commonly predicted by molecular dynamics simulations of interfaces between solids .",
    "a contrary viewpoint @xcite is arrived at by lattice dynamics and green s function on one dimensional harmonic chains , showing that a maximum conductance exists when the interface properties help match the impedance from two sides .",
    "this maximum conductance can be obtained with an optimal interfacial bonding ( the harmonic mean of the bonding from two sides ) and the favored connecting mass ( the geometric mean of the masses from two sides ) @xcite like scattering treatment would be consistent with this viewpoint , since the transmission depends quadratically on the mass deviation , producing a sweet spot along the transmission graph .",
    "the discrepancy can arise from two sources .",
    "the first is the presence of additional inelastic channels created by phonon - phonon interactions across interfaces .",
    "note that the theoretical observations showing a monotonically increasing conductance with interfacial bonding strength involve molecular dynamic simulations , where anharmonicity plays a significant role @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the maximum conductance arises in the absence of phonon - phonon interaction , relevant at low temperatures and low dimensions @xcite .",
    "a separate origin for the discrepancy is a dimensionality mismatch across the interface .",
    "a monotonic increase is found in 3d-3d interfaces ( e.g. thin films ) where the system can be decoupled into separate 1d chains for each transverse momentum . in contrast , 3d-1d interfaces such as molecular wires on substrates end up coupling the 1d modes strongly",
    ". the interfacial bonding strength needed to achieve maximum conductance will be unrealistically large in the former , 3d-3d case .",
    "recent research shows that anharmonicity has limited influence on the metal - sam systems , which are dominated by elastic transport of phonons across the metal - alkane junctions @xcite .",
    "phonon interference in the metal - sam systems was predicted both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , demonstrating that phonons across the chains encounter only weak phonon - phonon interaction .",
    "s. majumdar @xcite recently reported experimentally that the interfacial thermal conductance of this system decreases with the increased mismatch in frequency spectra between the two metal contacts , in fact behaving opposite to molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "this observation further validates elastic phonon transport along the chains .    motivated by the tuning capability of surface chemistry on the metal - alkane interfacial thermal conductance and the fact that phonon - phonon interaction in this system is trivial , we use ab - initio non - equilibrium green s function(negf ) method under harmonic approximation to explore the influence of the bond stiffness and end - group mass on the interfacial thermal conductance of the au - alkane junctions .",
    "we show that the maximum conductance can be obtained at a set of optimal interfacial properties .",
    "this result clarifies that in a dimension mismatched heterojunction , even in the case that bulk contact serves as a reservoir of channels , matched impedance still improves the conductance .",
    "we generalize our results with a simple one degree of freedom 3d-1d model and show that the conductance can be tracked by the density of states(dos ) , but is also influenced by the phonon group velocity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : first , we briefly discuss the structures of au - alkane surfaces with both thiol and amine as end groups .",
    "then we describe the way the bond stiffness is varied in this study .",
    "after that we introduce the first principle negf method with the `` scooping '' technique for the dimensionality transition followed by a short decription of negf based dmm method . finally we discuss and analyze our first principle interfacial thermal conductance results and generalize them by using a simple 3d-1d model .",

    "for the same system @xcite .",
    "we use two different mechanisms to vary the interfacial bonding strength : varying the adsorption distance , or directly varying the bonding energy @xmath53 relative to the au - alkane thiol junction . in the case of varying adsorption distance",

    "we assume once again that the bond stiffness is fixed at its 2 value , and then change the corresponding mass matrix of the end - group .    in order to focus on the influence of bonding strength and mass of the end - group attached to gold , we assume there is no impedance mismatch between the alkane end c@xmath10h@xmath29 unit and the thiol end - group , and set their bonding strength equal to the one between two c@xmath10h@xmath29 units .",

    "curiously , the corresponding interfacial thermal conductance reaches a maximum at a distance 1.9 , which is close to the relaxed distance for alkanethiols self - assembled on gold .",
    "the existence of a maximum is independently validated when we directly vary the bond strength , as shown in fig .",

    "a maximum conductance is seen to arise when the bond strength is around 1.3 times the initial 2@xmath56 distance value for thiol . when the bond strength continues to increase , the interfacial thermal conductance reduces and ultimately seems to saturate .",
    "a maximum is also observed around 10 a.m.u . when we plot the thermal conductance against the mass of the end group .",
    "this mass is lower than the mass of the c atom , indicating that the vibrational dynamics of the hydrogen atoms can not be ignored .",
    "for an impedance matched to maximize thermal transport across the interfaces , we would normally expect the preferred bonding mass to lie in between the masses of the two contacts .",
    "the maximizing mass also suggests that the prevailing hautman - klein model @xcite in molecular dynamics method used to simulate the alkane chains , where we neglect hydrogen atoms and add their masses instead to the carbon atoms , might not be suitable in the harmonic limit .",
    "we can use the negf extracted mode count in the dmm formula to directly estimate the thermal conductance ( fig .",

    "the shaded area in this plot represents the tunable range of the interfacial thermal conductance reached by varying the interfacial strength and the end - group atomic mass .",
    "the range is predicted by the two approaches we described earlier in this section , which as we cautioned ignores the impedance between the alkane end c@xmath10h@xmath29 unit and the thiol anchoring group .",
    "ignoring this contribution implies that the upper - limit of the tunable range could well be smaller than the shaded area in the harmonic assumption .",

    "this maximum is still less than the conductance that dmm predicts for this system .",
    "since dmm arises in the limit of complete dephasing , it seems that such dephasing events must break restrictive symmetry selection rules that would otherwise limit the bandwidth of the transmitting phonon modes across the two dissimilar materials . in reality",
    ", we expect the answer to be slightly lower than dmm , because true dephasing events retain partial memory , and also tends to reduce the average transmission per mode .      to explore whether our conclusions generalize to dimensional mismatch , we also studied a simplified one degree of freedom 3d-1d interface with only one degree of mechanical freedom ( fig .",

    "<S> we theoretically explore the influence of end - group chemistry ( bond stiffness and mass ) on the interfacial thermal conductance at a gold - alkane interface . </S>",
    "<S> we accomplish this using the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) coupled with first principle parameters in density functional theory ( dft ) within the harmonic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the interfacial thermal conductance is not a monotonic function of either chemical parameters , but instead maximizes at an optimal set of mass and bonding strength . </S>",
    "<S> this maximum is a result of the interplay between the overlap in local density of states of the device and that in the contacts , as well as the phonon group velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the intrinsic relationship between the diffusive mismatch model ( dmm ) and the properties from negf , and provide an approach to get dmm from first principles negf . by comparing the negf based dmm conductance and range of conductance while altering the mass and bonding strength </S>",
    "<S> , we show that dmm provides an upper bound for elastic transport in this dimensionally mismatched system . </S>",
    "<S> we thus have a prescription to enhance the thermal conductance of systems at low temperatures or at low dimensions where inelastic scattering is considerably suppressed . </S>"
