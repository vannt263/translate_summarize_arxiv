    "spin and charge are among the basic properties of elementary particles such as an electron , positron and proton .",
    "the perturbation of a system of electrons by an electric field or light may lead to a flow of the particles .",
    "the typical example is an electric current that represents the directed flow of charge carriers .",
    "usually the electric currents do not entail a considerable spin transfer because of the random orientation of electron spins",
    ". however , the charge current can be accompanied by a spin current as it happens , e.g. , under injection of spin - polarized carriers from magnetic materials or in the optical - orientation - induced circular photogalvanic effect .",
    "furthermore , there exists a possibility to create a pure spin current which is not accompanied by a net charge transfer .",
    "this state represents a non - equilibrium distribution when electrons with the spin `` up '' propagate mainly in one direction and those with the spin `` down '' propagate in the opposite direction . in terms of the kinetic theory ,",
    "it can be illustrated by a spin density matrix with two nonzero components , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the electron spin index and the wave vector , and @xmath3 means the spin opposite to @xmath1 .",
    "spin currents in semiconductors can be driven by an electric field acting on unpolarized free carriers which undergo a spin - dependent scattering .",
    "this is the so - called spin hall effect where a pure spin current appears in the direction perpendicular to the electric field .",
    "the spin currents can be induced as well by optical means as a result of interference of one- and two - photon coherent excitation with a two - color electro - magnetic field or under interband optical transitions in non - centrosymmetrical semiconductors  [ 1 ] .    here",
    "we show that pure spin currents , accompanied neither by charge transfer nor by spin orientation , can be achieved under absorption of linearly polarized or unpolarized light in semiconductor low - dimensional systems .",
    "particularly , the effect is considered for interband and free - carrier optical transitions in semiconductor qws .    in general ,",
    "the flux of electron spins can be characterized by a pseudo - tensor @xmath4 with the components @xmath5 describing the flow in the @xmath6 direction of spins oriented along @xmath7 , with @xmath7 and @xmath6 being the cartesian coordinates . in terms of the kinetic theory such a component of the spin current",
    "is contributed by a non - equilibrium correction @xmath8 to the electron spin density matrix , where @xmath9 is the pauli matrix .",
    "we demonstrate that the appearance of a pure spin current under optical pumping is linked with two fundamental properties of semiconductor qws , namely , the _",
    "spin splitting _ of energy spectrum linear in the wave vector and the spin - sensitive _ selection rules _ for optical transitions .",
    "= 0.6    the effect is most easily conceivable for direct transitions between the heavy - hole valence subband @xmath10 and conduction subband @xmath11 in qws of the c@xmath12 point symmetry , e.g. in ( 113)- or ( 110)-grown qws . in such structures the spin component along the qw normal @xmath13 is coupled with the in - plane electron wave vector .",
    "this leads to @xmath2-linear spin - orbit splitting of the energy spectrum as sketched in fig .  1 , where heavy hole subband @xmath10 is split into two spin branches @xmath14 .",
    "as a result they are shifted relative to each other in the @xmath2 space . in the reduced - symmetry structures ,",
    "the spin splitting of the conduction subband is usually smaller than that of the valence band and not shown in fig .  1 for simplicity .",
    "due to the selection rules the direct optical transitions from the valence subband @xmath10 to the conduction subband @xmath11 can occur only if the electron angular momentum changes by @xmath15 .",
    "it follows then that the allowed transitions are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as illustrated in fig .  1 by vertical lines .",
    "under excitation with linearly polarized or unpolarized light the rates of both transitions are equal . in the presence of spin splitting ,",
    "the optical transitions induced by photons of the fixed energy @xmath18 occur in the opposite points of the @xmath2-space for the spin branches @xmath19 .",
    "the asymmetry of photoexcitation results in a flow of electrons within each spin branch . the corresponding fluxes @xmath20 and @xmath21 are of equal strengths but directed in the opposite directions .",
    "thus , this non - equilibrium electron distribution is characterized by the nonzero spin current @xmath22 = @xmath23 but a vanishing charge current , @xmath24 .",
    "the direction @xmath6 of the photo - induced spin current and the orientation @xmath7 of transmitted spins are determined by the form of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the latter is governed by the qw symmetry and can be varied . for qws based on zinc - blende - lattice semiconductors and grown along the crystallographic direction @xmath25 \\parallel z$ ]",
    ", the light absorption leads to a flow along @xmath26 $ ] of spins oriented along @xmath13 .",
    "this component of the electron spin flow can be estimated as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant describing the @xmath2-linear spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath10 subband , @xmath29 is the relaxation time of the spin current , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the electron and hole effective masses in the qw plane , respectively , @xmath32 is the light absorbance , and @xmath33 is the light intensity .",
    "note that the time @xmath29 can differ from the conventional momentum relaxation time that governs the electron mobility .    in ( 001)-grown qws the absorption of linearly- or unpolarized light results in a flow of electron spins oriented in the qw plane . in contrast to the low - symmetry qws considered above , in ( 001)-qws the @xmath2-linear spin splitting of the valence subband @xmath10 is small and here , for the sake of simplicity , we assume the parabolic spin - independent dispersion in the @xmath10 valence subband and take into account the spin - dependent contribution @xmath34 to the electron effective hamiltonian .",
    "then , to the first order in the spin - orbit coupling , the components of the pure spin current generated in the subband @xmath11 are derived to be @xmath35",
    "light absorption by free carriers , or the drude - like absorption , occurs in doped semiconductor structures when the photon energy @xmath18 is smaller than the band gap as well as the intersubband spacing . because of the energy and momentum conservation the free - carrier optical transitions become possible if they are accompanied by electron scattering by acoustic or optical phonons , static defects etc .",
    "scattering - assisted photoexcitation with unpolarized light also gives rise to a pure spin current .",
    "however , in contrast to the direct transitions considered above , the spin splitting of the energy spectrum leads to no essential contribution to the spin current induced by free - carrier absorption .",
    "the more important contribution comes from asymmetry of the electron spin - conserving scattering . in semiconductor",
    "qws the matrix element @xmath36 of electron scattering by static defects or phonons has , in addition to the main contribution @xmath37 , an asymmetric spin - dependent term  [ 2 ] @xmath38 where @xmath2 and @xmath39 are the electron initial and scattered wave vectors , respectively .",
    "microscopically this contribution is caused by the structural and bulk inversion asymmetry similar to the rashba / dresselhaus spin splitting of the electron subbands .",
    "the asymmetry of the electron - phonon interaction results in non - equal rates of indirect optical transitions for opposite wave vectors in each spin subband .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 , where the free - carrier absorption is shown as a combined two - stage process involving electron - photon interaction ( vertical solid lines ) and electron scattering ( dashed horizontal lines ) .",
    "the scattering asymmetry is shown by thick and thin dashed lines : electrons with the spin @xmath40 are preferably scattered into the states with @xmath41 , while particles with the spin @xmath42 are scattered predominantly into the states with @xmath43 .",
    "the asymmetry causes an imbalance in the distribution of photoexcited carriers in each subband @xmath44 over the positive and negative @xmath45 states and yields oppositely directed electron flows @xmath46 shown by horizontal arrows .",
    "similarly to the interband excitation considered in the previous section , this non - equilibrium distribution is characterized by a pure spin current without charge transfer .",
    "let us assume the photon energy @xmath18 to exceed the typical electron kinetic energy , @xmath47 for degenerate and @xmath48 for non - degenerate electron gas .",
    "then the pure spin current induced by free - carrier light absorption is given by @xmath49 \\eta_{e1 } i\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the light polarization unit vector , and @xmath51 is the light absorbance in this spectral range .",
    "in addition to the free - carrier absorption , the spin - dependent asymmetry of electron - phonon interaction can also give rise to a pure spin current in the process of photoelectron energy relaxation .",
    "in this relaxational mechanism the spin current is generated in a system of hot carriers , independently of heating means .",
    "besides the spin , free charge carriers can be characterized by another internal property , e.g. , by the valley index in multi - valley semiconductors .",
    "thus , one can consider pure orbit - valley currents in which case the net electric current vanishes but the partial currents contributed by carriers in the particular valleys are nonzero ."
