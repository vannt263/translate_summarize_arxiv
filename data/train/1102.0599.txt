    "recent experiments on cold atoms in optical lattices subject to time - periodic perturbations @xcite have provided clean realizations of a range of different types of ac control of coherent matter waves proposed by earlier theoretical studies @xcite . even neglecting the effects of inter - particle interactions , these studies identified nontrivial dynamical effects . in particular , for an oscillating potential of strength @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1",
    ", it was found that the tunneling amplitudes @xmath2 of the driven atoms take an effective , renormalized , value : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the lattice constant and @xmath5 denotes an ordinary bessel function and @xmath6 .",
    "values of @xmath7 arise if an additional static linear ( in @xmath8 , the position ) field @xmath9 is applied , satisfying a resonance condition @xmath10 .",
    "the inter - site transport is completely suppressed at parameters corresponding to the zeros of the bessel functions .",
    "the oscillating potential can be implemented with ultracold atoms in shaken optical lattices , which yield potentials of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a phase which can be controlled .",
    "thus , eq.([renorm ] ) was demonstrated and investigated experimentally in refs .",
    "the observed suppression of transport is variously termed dynamic localization ( dl ) or coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) , depending on the transport regime @xcite .",
    "they are both effects of the one - particle dynamics ; comparatively less work has been done in the strongly interacting regime though , for example , in  @xcite they have investigated interactions - driven effects .",
    "recent studies consider even triangular , shaken lattices @xcite .    the experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite investigated the spreading or local tunneling of an atomic wavepacket , without global motion .",
    "but an earlier theoretical study @xcite had proposed also the possibility of global transport of the atomic wavepacket in the presence of the additional static field and assuming @xmath13 ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) .",
    "recent experiments using a static field @xcite were able to realize both directed motion as well as large oscillations , occurring over hundreds of sites , which were termed `` super  bloch oscillations '' ( sbos ) @xcite .",
    "these sbos were analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , including the effects of weak interactions ( mean - field regime ) .",
    "the general assumption was that the group velocity in these cases @xmath15 , i.e. , the dependence of the dynamics on the oscillating field @xmath16 , is entirely contained in the bessel function argument .",
    "we show here that , in order to explain the new experiments , a phase correction @xmath17 must  additionally  be considered either in an effective dispersion relation or in the average group velocities .",
    "we show that inclusion of the appropriate terms can account for several unexplained experimental features in the experiments @xcite .",
    "a notable example is a field dependent shift observed in the phase of sbos , not accounted for by the usual analysis .",
    "other features include the different field dependence of the speed of directed motion , on resonance , relative to the amplitude of sbos .",
    "there is also currently much interest in pairing phenomena , motivated by many ground - breaking experiments with ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "we have previously shown @xcite that in the case of attractive interactions , where the atoms can form bound - pairs , the second - order tunneling mechanism implies a different renormalization by the field and thus develop a global velocity _ relative _ to unpaired atoms .",
    "we investigate here for the first time the dynamics of pairs in the sbos regime .",
    "we find the paired / unpaired components can be made to re - collide repeatedly ; the novelty here is that the new @xmath18-dependent phase term enables control of re - collisions : the two components can either touch and reflect or can be forced through each other .",
    "experimental demonstration is a matter of combining the techniques used to study of dynamics of bound pairs @xcite with the ac driving in refs .",
    "@xcite ; the re - collisions in two component ultracold gases suggest the possibility of other applications in cold chemistry .",
    "the central objective of the present work is the effect of the phase of the ac driving acting on an initially undisturbed atomic wavepacket .",
    "thus , the phase @xmath12 must be well defined over every cycle , and the driving field must be switched on initially over a time that is small relative to the driving period . but provided this constraint is satisfied , the switch - on protocol is immaterial .",
    "the observed effects are never due to a discontinuous `` switch - on '' or an abrupt jump in amplitude of the potential at @xmath19 ; in fact the strongest experimental effects occur for @xmath20 where the potential ramps up smoothly from zero at @xmath19 ( i.e. , a pure @xmath21 drive ) .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of adiabatically switching on ac driving over many driving periods on the floquet quasi - energy bands , where the phase is thus of no consequence .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite considered slow linear ramping of the driving @xmath22 by means of a perturbative treatment valid for high @xmath1 . for a ramp period lasting an integer number of periods @xmath23 , a net ratchet current was obtained .",
    "other forms of driving like amplitude modulated lattices that do not show dynamic localization can also produce directed motion @xcite .    in section",
    "ii below , we review key aspects of the theory of renormalization of tunneling for atoms subject to ac forcing . in section iii",
    "we show that the phase corresponds to directed motion and compare with other systems . in section iv we analyze super  bloch oscillations and obtain an expression which we show explains important features of recent experiments .",

    "we restrict our one - particle problem , i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the creation and annihilation operators of a fermion or boson , to the lowest band @xmath33 ; taking @xmath34 , the energy dispersion @xmath35 so this corresponds to the group velocity @xmath36    assuming that the external driving is linear in position , we have @xmath37 where @xmath38 ; in general it comprises both a static field and a sinusoidally oscillating field with an arbitrary phase @xmath12 .",
    "the result of the driving is a time - dependent wavenumber : @xmath39 the stationary states of the system are its floquet states , the analogues of bloch waves in a temporally periodic system .",

    "the non - periodic phase term is characterized by the quasienergy @xmath43 .",
    "the evolution of a wavepacket projected onto its floquet states is fully determined : the quasienergies play a role entirely analogous to the energy eigenvalues of a time - independent system ; the ( period - averaged ) group velocity @xmath44 of a wavepacket is given from their dispersion : @xmath45 evaluated at the appropriate initial momentum , @xmath46 , in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ vg ] ) for the undriven system .",
    "below we take @xmath47 , which implies @xmath48 .    the presence of the static linear field , in general , destroys the band dynamics ; however , here we consider the so - called resonant driving case , for which @xmath49 , ( where the driving compensates for the energy offset between neighboring wells in the lattice , restoring the band structure ) . in this case , it can be shown  @xcite that an effective quasienergy dispersion is obtained from the energy dispersion by a period - averaging , over one oscillation : @xmath50    we begin by considering the case @xmath51 : in the first experimental studies on dynamic localization , @xmath52 and thus the static field was absent . in previous theoretical studies ( ref .",

    "( [ quasi ] ) , the well - known renormalization expression ( see also detailed derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite ) was obtained : @xmath54    it can be seen that the tunneling amplitude is multiplied by a bessel function .",
    "now the hopping can be completely suppressed at the zeros of the zero - th order bessel function .",
    "this process was first demonstrated in ref .",

    "( [ vg1 ] ) indicates an average group - velocity @xmath56 .",
    "the situation is quite different if the integral eq .",
    "( [ quasi ] ) is evaluated without disregarding @xmath12 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that even for the case @xmath57 , a momentum shift in the effective dispersion results .",
    "for the case of general @xmath12 , the effective dispersion relation becomes : @xmath58 , \\label{renorm1}\\ ] ] where one sees that there is an @xmath59 shift , representing the average momentum over one cycle .",
    "this is no longer equal to zero .",
    "the result of this field - dependent shift is to introduce directed motion , at constant ( period - averaged ) group velocity @xcite .",
    "atoms in shaken lattices experience a homogeneous ( position independent ) force . independently , theoretical",
    "@xcite and experimental @xcite studies considered the role of phase jumps in driven traps .",
    "these have inhomogeneous forces ; for a driving field , @xmath60 classically , the phase effects a position - dependent momentum shift @xmath61 . the position dependence of @xmath62",
    "strongly couples the phase to the dynamics .",
    "@xmath63 can generate larger / smaller amplitude oscillations in the trap and has been proposed as a means to control the kinetic energy of the atoms oscillating in the trap .    despite the different dynamics , for all the above systems",
    ", the effect of the phase vanishes for @xmath64 .    in eq .",
    "( [ renorm1 ] ) , the @xmath59 phase shift coincides with the value of the lower bound of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ waveq ] ) ( here evaluated at @xmath19 ) .",
    "this might lead one to conclude that the shift arises from the abrupt jump in the amplitude of the driving potential at @xmath65 .",
    "but this would be a misapprehension ; the key physical significance of the shift is that it is the average momentum over each cycle , since @xmath66 takes the same form .",
    "below we find that the strongest experimental effects occur for @xmath20 where the driving grows linearly from zero for @xmath65 ( a pure @xmath21 drive ) .",
    "the phase must be well defined over every cycle , so the switch - on time @xmath67 should satisfy the condition @xmath68 . but provided this constraint is satisfied , the switch - on protocol is immaterial .",
    "we now analyze recently discovered large scale oscillations for cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "although they are phase - dependent , we note that they are quite different from the atoms in traps : the dynamics are independent of initial position ( the wavepacket is delocalized over several wells ) .",
    "we show also that the sbos rely crucially on a specific quantum resonance ( more precisely a slight detuning from it ) .",
    "we show below that their amplitude does not depend on @xmath12 ( unlike oscillations in traps ) ; only their phase does .",
    "below we also consider the case of non - zero @xmath69 as well as slight detuning for which @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , associated with sbos , for which the above relation still holds .    in order to calculate ( period - averaged ) group velocities",

    "( [ position ] ) can largely account for the complex dependence of experimental results on @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , it was noted in ref .",

    "( [ dispersion ] ) ] ; it was also noted that the sbo amplitudes scale as @xmath94 ; also , for @xmath20 , the sbo amplitude was close to a maximum for @xmath95 .",
    "in contrast , we see that for @xmath96 ( directed motion ) the peak velocity occurs wherever @xmath97 is a maximum ( i.e. , at @xmath98 ) .",
    "the directed motion is in fact almost zero for @xmath99 , the point where the sbos were near their maximum , but the highest experimental directed motion was given for @xmath98 .",

    "we now consider the effect of the sbo phases in a regime of attractive interactions and fermionic atoms , such as investigated in refs .  @xcite . in that case , we model the dynamics by the many - body hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the creation and annihilation operators of a fermion and @xmath119 .",

    "( [ dispersion ] ) , we can show that for the regime of the experiments ( @xmath14 and @xmath57 ) @xcite , the bp group velocity is @xmath144 thus , the order of the bessel , its argument , and the additional phase are all doubled ; so the zeros and maxima of the bp motion occur at different fields from the unpaired atoms .",
    "however , in the presence of the driving , neither the bps nor unpaired states remain eigenstates of the system . for @xmath145 , though , the energy gap between bps and unpaired atoms can not be closed by the fields , and there is relatively little mixing .",
    "we tested this assumption for simulations for lattices with @xmath146@xmath129 sites and @xmath147 , and @xmath131 atoms .",

    "thus , we consider the large @xmath150 regime where bp and unpaired dynamics is separated and break - up rates of the bps are modest : for @xmath151 , the pairing rate falls rapidly and can oscillate in time .",
    "a further advantage of large @xmath120 is that the bps are essentially static , thus reducing another source of uncertainty .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the results of calculations slightly above the threshold where the field can strongly couple the bound - pair states and free atoms , and there is already a certain degree of interaction in evidence .",
    "it is seen that the bp component is essentially immobile , while the unpaired atoms perform large - scale oscillations ; the unpaired atoms periodically return and re - collide with the bp packet . however , the @xmath115 trajectories attempt to `` push - through '' the bps , leading in general to a degree of beam - splitting , which depends on the kinetic energy ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) and effective @xmath139 ( @xmath152 ) .",
