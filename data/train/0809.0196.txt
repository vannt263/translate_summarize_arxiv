    "the idea of the multifractal approach to fully developed turbulence has been introduced by giorgio parisi and uriel frisch during the summer school _ turbulence and predictability of geophysical fluid dynamics _ held in varenna in june 1983 @xcite .",
    "one of us ( a.v . ) had the chance to participate to that school and then to coauthor , with r. benzi , g. parisi and g.paladin , the paper published in this journal where the word multifractal appeared for the first time @xcite .    from a technical point of view",
    "the idea of the multifractal is basically contained in the large deviation theory @xcite which is an important chapter of the probability theory",
    ". however the introduction of the multifractal description in the 1980 s had an important role in statistical physics , chaos and disordered systems .",
    "in particular to clarify in a rather net way that the usual idea , coming from the critical phenomena , that just few scaling exponents are relevant , is wrong , while an infinite set of exponents is necessary for a complete characterization of the scaling features . + as pioneering works which anticipated some aspects of the the multifractal approach to turbulence we can cite the lognormal theory of kolmogorov @xcite , the contributions of novikov and stewart @xcite and mandelbrot @xcite .",
    "this paper has no pretense to be a survey of the many applications of the multifractal description in chaos , disordered systems and natural phenomena ; for general reviews on these aspects see @xcite . for a more mathematically oriented treatment",
    "see @xcite .",
    "our aim is a discussion on the the use of the multifractal methods in the study of the scaling features of fully developed turbulence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] is devoted to the introduction of the multifractal model of turbulence and its connections with the @xmath0 vs @xmath1 formalism introduced by halsey _",
    "@xcite , and the large deviations theory @xcite . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we discuss the implication of multifractality on eulerian features , namely the statistical properties of the velocity gradients and the existence of an intermediate dissipative range .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] is devoted to the implications of the multifractal nature of turbulence on lagrangian statistics . in section 5",
    "we present the lagrangian acceleration statistics .",
    "section 6 treats the relative dispersion , in particular we discuss the multifractal generalization of the classical richardson theory .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the multifractal analysis of the dispersion in two - dimensional convection .",
    "let us consider the navier - stokes equations for an incompressible fluid : @xmath2 because of the nonlinear structure of the equation , an analytical treatment is a formidable task .",
    "for instance in the @xmath3 case a theorem for the existence of global solution for arbitrary @xmath4 is still missing .    for a perfect fluid ( i.e. @xmath5 ) and in absence of external forces ( @xmath6 )",
    ", the evolution of the velocity field is given by the euler equation , which conserves the kinetic energy for smooth solutions .",
    "in such a case , introducing an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath7 on the wave numbers , it is possible to build up an equilibrium statistical mechanics simply following the standard approach used for the hamiltonian statistical mechanics . on the other hand , because of the so called dissipative anomaly @xcite , in @xmath3 the limit @xmath8 is singular and can not be interchanged with @xmath9 , therefore the statistical mechanics of an inviscid fluid has a rather limited relevance for the navier - stokes equations at very high reynolds numbers ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the typical speed and length of the system , respectively ) .",
    "in addition , mainly as a consequence of the non - gaussian statistics , even a systematic statistical approach , e.g. in term of closure approximations , is very difficult @xcite .    in the fully developed turbulence ( fdt ) limit ,",
    "i.e. @xmath8 , and in the presence of forcing at large scale , one has a non equilibrium statistical steady state , with an inertial range of scales , where neither energy pumping nor dissipation acts , which shows strong departures from the equipartition @xcite .",
    "a simple and elegant explanation of the main statistical features of fdt is due to kolmogorov @xcite : in a nutshell , it is assumed the existence of a range of scales where the energy  injected at the scale @xmath12  flows down ( with a cascade process , as remarked by richardson  @xcite ) to the dissipative scale @xmath13 , where it is dissipated by molecular viscosity . since , practically , neither injection nor dissipation takes place in the inertial range , the only relevant quantity is the average energy transfer rate @xmath14 .",
    "dimensional counting imposes the power law dependence for the second order structure function ( sf ) @xmath15 where , for the sake of simplicity , we ignore the vectorial nature of the velocity field .",
    "the scaling law ( [ i.2 ] ) is equivalent to a power spectrum @xmath16 in good agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "the original kolmogorov theory ( often indicated as k41 ) assumes self - similarity of the turbulent flow . as a consequence ,",
    "the scaling behavior of higher order structure functions @xmath17 is described by a single scaling exponent : @xmath18 .",
    "the navier - stokes equations are formally invariant under the scaling transformation : @xmath19 with @xmath20 ( indeed the reynolds number @xmath21 is invariant under the above transformations ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath22 can not be determined with only symmetry considerations , nevertheless there is a rather natural candidate : @xmath23 .",
    "such a value of the exponent is suggested by the dimensional argument of the k41 and also , and more rigorously , by the so - called `` 4/5 law '' , an exact relation derived by kolmogorov from the navier  stokes equations @xcite , which , under the assumption of stationarity , homogeneity and isotropy , states @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the longitudinal velocity difference between two points at distance @xmath26 .",
    "we can say that the k41 theory corresponds to a global invariance with @xmath23 and therefore @xmath18 .",
    "this result is in disagreement with several experimental investigations @xcite which have shown deviations of the scaling exponents from @xmath27 .",
    "this phenomenon , which goes under the name of intermittency @xcite , is a consequence of the breakdown of self  similarity and implies that the scaling exponents can not be determined on a simple dimensional basis .    a simple way to modify the k41 consists in assuming that the energy dissipation is uniformly distributed on homogeneous fractal with dimension @xmath28 .",
    "this implies @xmath29 with @xmath30 for @xmath31 on the fractal and @xmath32 non singular otherwise .",
    "this assumption ( called absolute curdling or @xmath33- model ) gives : @xmath34 such a prediction , with @xmath35 , is in fair agreement with the experimental data for small values of @xmath36 , but higher order scaling exponents give a clear indication of a non linear behavior in @xmath36 .",
    "the multifractal model of turbulence @xcite assumes that the velocity has a local scale - invariance , i.e. there is not a unique scaling exponent @xmath22 such that @xmath37 , but a continuous spectrum of exponents , each of which belonging to a given fractal set . in other words , in the inertial range one has @xmath38 if @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is a fractal set with dimension @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "the probability to observe a given scaling exponent @xmath22 at the scale @xmath26 is @xmath45 and therefore one has @xmath46 for @xmath47 , a steepest descent estimation gives @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the solution of the equation @xmath50 .",
    "the kolmogorov `` 4/5 '' law ( [ i.3 ] ) imposes @xmath51 which implies that @xmath52 with the equality realized by @xmath53 .",
    "the kolmogorov similarity theory corresponds to the case of only one singularity exponent @xmath23 with @xmath54 .",
    "of course the computation of @xmath41 , or equivalently @xmath55 , from the nse is not at present an attainable goal .",
    "a first step is a phenomenological approach using multiplicative processes .",
    "let us briefly remind the so called random @xmath33- model @xcite .",
    "this model describes the energy cascade in real space looking at eddies of size @xmath56 , with @xmath12 the length at which the energy is injected . at the @xmath57- th step of the cascade a mother eddy of size @xmath58 splits into daughter eddies of size @xmath59 , and the daughter eddies cover a fraction @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) of the mother volume . as a consequence of the fact that the energy transfer is constant throughout the cascade one has for the velocity differences @xmath62 on scale",
    "@xmath58 is non negligible only on a fraction of volume @xmath63 , and it is given by @xmath64 where the @xmath60 s are independent , identically distributed random variables .",
    "phenomenological arguments suggest : @xmath65 with probability @xmath66 and @xmath67 with probability @xmath68 the above multiplicative process generates a two - scale cantor set , which is a rather common structure in chaotic systems .",

    "( i.e. @xmath76 ) one has a good fit for the @xmath55 of the experimental data at high reynolds numbers .     plotted vs @xmath36 .",
    "circles and triangles correspond to the data of anselmet at al . @xcite .",
    "the solid line corresponds to kolmogorov scaling @xmath27 ; the dashed line is the random beta model prediction ( [ eq : rbm ] ) with @xmath76 and @xmath74 ; the dotted line is the she - leveque prediction ( [ eq : sl ] ) with @xmath77.,width=10 ]    of course it is not so astonishing to find a model to fit the experimental data . indeed , there are now many phenomenological models for @xmath41 which provide scaling exponents in agreement with experimental data .",
    "a popular one is the so - called she - leveque model @xcite which is reproduced by the multifractal model with @xmath78\\ ] ] and gives for the scaling exponents @xmath79 which are close to the experimental data for @xmath77 .",
    "another important model , which was introduced by kolmogorov himself without reference to the multifractal model , is the log - normal model which will be discussed in section  [ sec:1.3 ] .    the relevance , and the success , of the multifractal approach is in the possibility to predict , and test , nontrivial statistical features , e.g. the pdf of the velocity gradient , the existence of an intermediate dissipative range and precise scaling for lagrangian quantities .",
    "once @xmath41 is obtained by a fit of the experimental data , e.g. from the @xmath55 , then all the predictions obtained in the multifractal model framework must be verified without additional free parameters .      the multifractal model for the fdt previously discussed",
    "is linked to the so called @xmath0 vs @xmath1 description of the singular measures ( e.g. in chaotic attractors ) @xcite . in order to show this connection",
    "let us recall the kolmogorov revised theory @xcite ( called k62 ) stating that the velocity increments @xmath80 scales as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the energy dissipation space - averaged over a cube of edge @xmath26 .",
    "let us introduce the measure @xmath83 , a partition of non overlapping cells of size @xmath26 and the coarse graining probability @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a cube of edge @xmath26 centered in @xmath86 , of course @xmath87 . denoting with @xmath1 the scaling exponent of @xmath88 and with @xmath0 the fractal dimension of the subfractal with scaling exponent @xmath1",
    ", we can introduce the renyi dimensions @xmath89 : @xmath90 where the sum is over the non empty boxes .",

    "let us note that the lognormal theory k62 where @xmath96 is a special case of the multifractal model , where there are not restriction on the values of @xmath22 and @xmath41 is a parabola with a maximum at @xmath97 : @xmath98 and the parameter @xmath99 is determined by the fluctuation of @xmath100 .      to obtain the scaling behavior of @xmath101 given by ( [ i.5 ] ) with @xmath55 obtained from ( [ i.6 ] )",
    ", one has to assume that the exponent @xmath102 has a minimum , @xmath55 , which is a function of @xmath22 , and that such an exponent behaves quadratically with @xmath22 in the vicinity of the minimum .",
    "this is the basic assumption to apply the laplace s method of steepest descent @xcite .",
    "the point we would like to recall here is that , for small separations , @xmath26 , it is true that @xmath101 but with a logarithmic prefactor : @xmath103^{-1/2 } \\left ( \\frac{\\ell}{l}\\right ) ^{\\zeta_p}\\ ] ] such a prefactor is usually not considered in the naive application of laplace method leading to ( [ i.5 ] ) .",
    "the presence of such logarithmic correction , if present , would clearly invalidate the @xmath104-th law ( [ i.3 ] ) , one of the very few exact results in fully developed turbulence .",
    "+ the question on whether such logarithmic correction is likely has quantitatively been addressed by frisch et al .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", exploiting the refined large - deviations theory , the authors were able to explain in which way the logarithmic contribution cancels out thus giving rise to a prediction fully compatible with the naive ( a priory unjustified ) procedure to extract the scaling behavior ( [ i.5 ] ) .",
    "the key point is that the leading order large deviation result for the probability @xmath105 to be within a distance @xmath26 of the set carrying singularities of scaling exponent between @xmath22 and @xmath106 , @xmath107^{1/2 } d h\\;,\\ ] ] must be generalized to take into account next subleading order .",
    "in doing so , as a result one obtains @xcite @xmath108^{1/2},\\ ] ] which contains subleading logarithmic correction .",
    "it is worth observing that despite the multiplicative character of the logarithmic correction one speaks of `` subleading correction '' .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the correct statement of the large - deviations leading - order result involves the logarithm of the probability divided by the logarithm of the scale .",
    "the correction is then a subleading additive term .",
    "+ once the expression ( [ better ] ) is plugged in the integral @xmath109 and the saddle point estimation is carried out according to @xcite , logarithms disappear and the expected @xmath104-th law emerges . + it is worth mentioning that the presence of a square root of a logarithm correction in the multifractal probability density had already been proposed by @xcite on the basis of a normalization requirement . in that paper",
    ", the authors observed that without such a correction the singularity spectrum @xmath0 comes out wrong ; they also pointed out that a similar correction has been proposed by @xcite in connection with the measurement of generalized renyi dimensions .",
    "at first we note that a consequence of presence of the intermittency the kolmogorov scale does not take a unique value .",
    "the local dissipative scale @xmath110 is determined by imposing the effective reynolds number to be of order unity : @xmath111 therefore the dependence of @xmath110 on @xmath22 is thus @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the large scale reynolds number @xcite .    in this section",
    "we will show that the fluctuations of the dissipative scale , due to the intermittency in the turbulent cascade , is relevant of the statistical features of the velocity differences and velocity gradient , and in addition it implies the existence of an intermediate region between the inertial and dissipative range @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath114 the longitudinal velocity gradient .",
    "such a quantity can immediately be expressed in terms of the singularity exponents @xmath22 as @xmath115 where we used the fact that @xmath116 from ( [ i.4 ] ) and we have exploited ( [ ii.2 ] ) . from ( [ eq : s ] ) we realize that we can easily express the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath114 ( for a fixed @xmath22 ) , @xmath117 , in terms of the pdf , @xmath118 , of the large - scale velocity differences @xmath119 , with @xmath120 .",
    "the latter pdf is indeed known to be accurately described by the gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "the link between the two pdfs is given by the standard relation : @xmath121 from which one immediately gets : @xmath122 the k41 theory and the @xmath33 model correspond to @xmath23 and @xmath30 , respectively . in both cases , a stretched exponential form for the pdf",
    "is predicted with an exponent , @xmath123 , larger than one .",
    "experimental data ( see e.g.  @xcite ) are not consistent with such a prediction being actually compatible with a stretched exponent whose value is smaller than one .",
    "+ the multifractal description has thus to be exploited to capture those experimental evidences . to do that we recall the expression ( [ eq : vn ] ) for the random @xmath33 model @xmath124",
    "from which the probability distribution of the velocity increments @xmath125 reads : @xmath126 here @xmath127 is the probability density of the @xmath128 s assumed to be of the form : @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "+ since the @xmath128 s are identically distributed , the above integral becomes : @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",

    "on the other hand , in the laboratory reference frame the sweeping dominates the time evolution in a fixed point of the space and we must use as characteristic times of the processes @xmath416 the sweeping times @xmath417 , i.e. , @xmath418 ."
