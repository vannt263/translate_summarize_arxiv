    "in recent years , interest in quantum measurement has emerged in the context of solid state devices .",
    "this is in part forced by practical issues in connection with experiments involving nanostructures , and general questions of decoherence,@xcite and issues arising in nanomechanics , for example in probing the quantum electro - mechanical behavior of a nano - resonator , and is also crucial for the read - out of a quantum computational process .",
    "solid state nanodevices such as quantum dots are candidates for implementation of spin qubits , @xcite and charge qubits , @xcite and superconducting nanodevices containing josephson junctions have been studied in detail,@xcite and are being tested for their potential as charge qubits .",
    "@xcite nanomechanics and monitoring qubits thus confront us with the practical details of a quantum measurement.@xcite in a quantum measurement one must , for the system purported to function as a detector , identify a collective variable which behaves classically . such a variable is not a priori provided by quantum theory , but in an electronic device the candidate is ultimately related to the charge flow .",
    "it is therefore of importance to have a quantum description of the charge transfer statistics , and demonstrate that a charge measurement can be a measurement of the state of a quantum object coupled to it .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to base such a description directly on the density matrix of the many - body system .",
    "the renewed interest in the quantum measurement process has in particular focussed on a two - level system coupled to a quantum point contact in the limit where the point contact can be modelled as a low transparency tunnel junction .",
    "the realization of the two - level system could be two coherently coupled quantum dots between which an excess electronic charge can tunnel.@xcite the two dots are electrostatically coupled to the tunnel junction , or quantum point contact , thereby making the tunnelling amplitude depend on the state of the two - level system .",
    "this model has recently attracted much attention .",
    "@xcite gurvitz @xcite derived for the zero temperature case , a markovian master equation for the density matrix of the two - level system keeping track of the charge transferred through the junction .",
    "goan _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite considered the bloch - redfield equation for the spin dynamics , i.e. , the electron degrees of freedom of the tunnel junction are traced out . to account for individual tunnelling events they employed the quantum jump approach often used in quantum optics , and obtained from the stochastic master equation",
    "the spin evolution for specific realizations of tunnelling events.@xcite to account for specific realizations of tunnelling events , korotkov similarly employed a stochastic treatment and showed by numerical simulation how an initially mixed spin state can evolve into a pure state.@xcite ruskov and korotkov considered the markovian master equation for the density matrix for the two - level system keeping track of the charge transferred through the junction at finite temperatures and calculated the noise spectrum.@xcite recent achievements in counting statistics of charge transfers,@xcite were used by shnirman _ et .",
    "al._,@xcite who derived a master equation for the spin density matrix , keeping track of the charges passing through the tunnel junction by a counting field as practised in counting statistics , and calculated the noise spectrum of a quantum point contact , with the same result as obtained by bulaevskii _ et .",
    "al._@xcite recently , a quantum oscillator coupled to the junction has been studied , but by a method only valid at zero temperature.@xcite the witnessed variety in techniques , calls for a standard method to attack these types of problems .",
    "we shall in the following develop a regular method for a joint description of the charge kinetics of a tunnel junction and a quantum system coupled to it .",
    "essential to the approach is that for an arbitrary many - body system we show how to treat the number of particles in a given spatial region or piece of material as a degree of freedom .",
    "this is achieved by employing suitably constructed charge projection operators introduced previously in the context of counting statistics.@xcite we shall refer to this reduced description , where at any moment in time the probability distribution for the number of particles or charges in a chosen region is specified , as the charge representation .",
    "the key construct of the theory is the charge specific density matrix where the degrees of freedom of the environment are partially traced out . the charge specific density matrix allows one to evaluate the probability of the outcome of any joint measurement of the system and the charge state .",
    "applying the charge projectors , allows us to use a standard kinetic approach to obtain the equation of motion for the density matrix in the charge representation .",
    "tunnel junctions and quantum point contacts are ubiquitous in nanodevices such as for example those utilizing two - dimensional electron gases in semiconductor inversion layers combined with split gate technique .",
    "the developed charge specific density matrix description of the dynamics of a quantum object we believe is the optimal description of such nanodevices since in electrical measurements any information beyond the charge distribution is irrelevant .",
    "this sets the stage for considering questions regarding quantum measurements , for example whether a measurement of the charge can provide a measurement of the state of a quantum object coupled to the junction .",
    "indeed we shall demonstrate that the junction is able to perform a projective von neumann measurement .",
    "the model allows us to study analytically a quantum measurement in the proper language of the density matrix .",
    "the intrinsic quantum bound on the measurement time necessary for the tunnel junction to operate as a measuring device is established .",
    "quantum theory and measurement has a long and controversial history , and the model provides another simple illustration that a quantum measurement can be described in standard quantum mechanical terms , in fact in full detail for a realistic model of a nanodevice .",
    "the measuring scheme illustrates that there is no need to postulate the classicallity of any variable , the charge state of the junction being directly accessible , nor to invoke `` wave function collapse . ''",
    "the transmission of the electrical noise in the tunnel junction to the quantum object turns out to be sufficient for the density matrix to decohere in the pointer basis .",
    "amplification from the quantum to the classical level , the emergence of a projective measurement , can thus be followed in a realistic model of a nanodevice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we construct the charge representation . in section iii , the coupled object - junction hamiltonian is introduced , and in section iv the equation of motion in the object and charge variables is obtained . in section",
    "v , we briefly discuss an isolated tunnel junction in the charge representation .",
    "the method we present is quite general , but for illustration we shall in this paper apply it to a low transparency tunnel junction coupled to a two - level system or for short a spin , and thereby obtain a master equation in terms of the relevant variables , charge and spin . in section",
    "vi , a short time measurement of the two - level system is considered and an analytic solution of the master equation is obtained .",
    "expressions for the characteristic times for decoherence and spin - charge separation are obtained . in section vii ,",
    "the temporal progression of a quantum measurement is studied and the emergence of a projective measurement is seen to be different depending on the relationship between voltage and temperature . in section viii",
    ", we estimate the intrinsic quantum bounds on the measurement time .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude . details of calculations are presented in appendices .",
    "we start by showing that the number of particles in a given spatial region can be treated as a degree of freedom .",
    "we construct the probability distribution for the number of particles in a specified region for an arbitrary many - body system .",
    "this is accomplished by using charge projection operators originally introduced in ref .",
    "consider an n - particle quantum system in a volume @xmath0 and in state @xmath1 . according to quantum mechanics , the probability , @xmath2 , that @xmath3 particles are in a sub - volume @xmath4 is @xmath5 where the indicator function @xmath6 is equal to @xmath7 if exactly @xmath3 of its @xmath8 spatial arguments belong to the region @xmath4 , and is zero otherwise .",
    "the volume @xmath4 and its supplement volume @xmath9 partitions the total volume into two non - overlapping parts , and the probability that there are @xmath10 particles in region @xmath9 equals the probability for having @xmath3 particles in region @xmath4 .",

    "the many - particle operator @xmath12 can be expressed in a simple way through single particle operators .",
    "we introduce the gauge transformation operators @xmath17 \\ ; , \\label{7sd}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a real parameter , and @xmath19 equals @xmath7 if @xmath20 belongs to the region @xmath4 and is zero otherwise . by virtue of the identity ,",
    "@xmath21 the projection operator can be presented in any representation as @xmath22 thus presenting the many - particle operator @xmath12 in terms of the product of the single particle gauge transformations in @xmath23 .",
    "this result can also be obtained by observing that the projected state , @xmath24 , is an eigenstate of @xmath23 , @xmath25 .",
    "if the region @xmath4 , where the particles are counted , occupies the whole volume @xmath0 , the charge projector coincides with the one used by p.w .",
    "anderson in the theory of superconductivity for projecting the bcs - wave function onto the state with a fixed particle number .",
    "we shall quite generally consider a system consisting of two parts : a quantum object to be measured and the measuring device , which is taken to be a tunnel junction connecting two electron reservoirs .    for the sake of the derivation , we assume that the object together with the electron reservoirs constitute a closed quantum system .",
    "the system is described by its full density matrix @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the coordinate of the object and @xmath28 comprises the electron coordinates , @xmath8 being the total number of electrons relevant for the functioning of the measuring device . with the understanding that the only accessible information about the electrons is their charge distribution , we introduce the charge specific density matrix of the measured system @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the projection operator introduced in the previous section , and the trace is with respect to the electron degrees of freedom @xmath31 . the charge specific density matrix @xmath32 allows one to deduce the probabilities of any joint measurement performed on the quantum object simultaneously with a charge measurement .",
    "if the charge specific density matrix is traced over the remaining degrees of freedom , the probability @xmath33 that there are @xmath3 charges in a specified region ( reference to which is suppressed in the following ) is the expectation value of the charge projector , or expressed in terms of the charge specific density matrix @xmath34 where the trace is with respect to the degrees of freedom of the quantum object , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ 8sd ] ) that the probability distribution is normalized , @xmath36 .",
    "apart from proper normalization , @xmath37 is the density matrix for the quantum object after a charge measurement .",
    "the charge projection operators define what we shall refer to as the charge representation .",
    "the degree of freedom in the charge representation is the variable @xmath3 : the number of charges in a specified spatial region or equivalently in a piece of material .",
    "all other information about the charges is traced out .",
    "the charge representation is a strongly reduced representation , the description of the environment is reduced to one variable , but if interest is in the currents in a system , information beyond the charge representation is irrelevant .",
    "we now consider the charge specific dynamics , i.e. , the equation of motion of the quantum object for specified charge .",

    "since the charge specific description is a reduced description , generally a hierarchy of equations is generated . in the following",
    "we shall study a situation where @xmath40 can be obtained explicitly .",
    "in this section we discuss the hamiltonian for an arbitrary quantum system coupled to a tunnel junction @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the hamiltonian for the isolated quantum object , the system to be measured , and a hat marks terms which are operators with respect to the degrees of freedom of the quantum object .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath43 specify the isolated left and right electrodes of the junction @xmath44 where @xmath45 labels the quantum numbers of the single particle energy eigenstates in the left and right electrodes , respectively , with corresponding energies @xmath46 and annihilation and creation operators .",
    "the operator @xmath47 describes tunnelling , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are operators acting on the coordinates , @xmath27 , of the quantum object .",
    "the hermitian property of the hamiltonian requires that @xmath51 .",
    "compared to an isolated tunnel junction , the additional feature of the model is that the tunnelling amplitude , and thereby the conductance of the tunnel junction , depends on the state of the measured system .    in the next section we shall study the dynamics of the system when the probability distribution for the number of charge transfers through the junction is specified at all times",
