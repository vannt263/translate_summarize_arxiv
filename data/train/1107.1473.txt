    "the standard model ( sm ) has accurately explained with great success the physics up to the @xmath10 gev scale .",
    "however , there are several hints that indicate that new physics ( np ) could be expected at the tev scale . among the main motivations to look for np at this scale , we can mention the quadratic divergences of the higgs mass and the mechanism responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking .    to explore the tev - scale physics ,",
    "physicists have built two colossal machines , tevatron and lhc .",
    "tevatron has not found signals of the higgs boson , but it has studied as never before the top quark sector . the lhc has begun its search for the higgs boson , which could take a few years . in the mean time , the lhc is becoming the largest _ top factory _ ever built .",
    "experiments in tevatron and lhc have a special focus in top quark physics since , from a theoretical point of view , it is expected that the top quark could be a window to the np @xcite .",
    "in fact , mainly because its extraordinary large mass and secondly because its poor exploration insofar , it is expected that the study of top quark production and the analysis of its properties , as couplings , mass and width , may throw some light on how is the np . as a matter of fact , cdf and d0 have published several articles @xcite in the last few years on @xmath0 pair - production , where in cdf results the forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath11 ) measurement did not agree with the sm nlo ( next - to - leading order ) expectation , whereas the cross section ( @xmath12 ) and its invariant - mass ( @xmath13 ) spectrum did agree with the sm nlo expectation .",
    "these results have raised the attention of the theoretical community which has essayed their hypothesis in several and varied publications @xcite . in a recent cdf article @xcite on this issue , it was found that the total @xmath11 agrees with the sm expectation , but when studied as a function of the invariant mass of the top pair a large deviation ( @xmath14 ) is found for large invariant mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross section and invariant - mass spectrum still agree with the sm expectation .",
    "the results in that article , which have also motivated many theoretical publications @xcite , are the motivation for the present work .",
    "cdf has reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that the forward - backward asymmetry measured in @xmath15 processes deviates from the sm prediction when the invariant mass of the @xmath0 pair is above @xmath16 gev .",
    "this deviation , when analyzed from the not - unfolded results , consists in 4 bins in the range @xmath17 in which , although with little statistical significance , _ all _ the measurements are _ above _ the sm expected . when this data is unfolded and computed in only 2 bins for @xmath18 gev , then a @xmath19 disagreement is found in the higher invariant mass bin .",
    "previous works @xcite have proposed new particles in @xmath20- and @xmath1-channel , and non - resonant np as effective operators to solve this anomaly . moreover , in all the @xmath1-channel proposals , the resonance mass is always pushed above @xmath21 tev in order to avoid spoiling the invariant - mass spectrum - channel resonance came out  @xcite . in the region of the parameter space shared with the present article",
    "we reach similar conclusions . ] . in this work , motivated by a qualitative analysis of the not - unfolded data on the @xmath11 in ref .",
    "@xcite which has much better resolution than the unfolded results , we explore the possibility of having an @xmath1-channel contribution of a new particle whose mass could be as light as @xmath22 gev .",
    "in fact , the excess in the not - unfolded data in @xmath11 may be suggesting the well studied tail of a non - resonant contribution , as well as a light ( @xmath23 gev ) resonance peak . henceforth , we have explored the phenomenology of an @xmath1-channel colour - octet resonance with chiral couplings in a mass range from @xmath2 gev to @xmath3 gev .",
    "we have required for the light resonance to be weakly coupled to light quarks in order to avoid spoiling the @xmath24 invariant - mass spectrum and the colliders jet phenomenology . as it is shown in the article ,",
    "these and other phenomenological requirements give rise naturally to composite model scenarios where only the top quark couples strongly to the np .",
    "moreover , we found that axial - like couplings for light and top quarks are preferred in all the studied mass range .",
    "although we found that larger masses are preferred , these are more likely to be excluded by the dijet phenomenology .",
    "it is worth stressing at this point that , although the motivation for this work came from a qualitative analysis of the above mentioned not - unfolded data , the quantitative analysis has been performed against the unfolded data .",
    "this work is divided as follows . in the next section we present the effective model to be used in the analysis . in section [ analytic ]",
    "we perform an analytic study of the process @xmath25 , paying special attention to the resonant and interfering terms in order to determine which are the best regions of the parameter space to look for agreement with the cdf observables @xmath11 and @xmath13-spectrum . in section [ numeric ]",
    "we present the results of monte carlo @xmath26 simulations , exploring the parameter space of the effective model which satisfies the cdf observables .",
    "section [ lhc ] analyzes the favourable points in parameter space found in previous section within the existing constraints and perspectives for lhc .",

    "we consider a model with a light gluon resonance transforming as an octet of su(3)@xmath27 and mass @xmath28 tev . such a scenario is naturally obtained within the framework of composite models and extra dimensions , since they typically contain this class of resonances  @xcite .",
    "the interactions with the sm - quarks are given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the chiral couplings between the gluon resonance and the sm quarks , in units of the strong coupling @xmath31 .",
    "for simplicity we will consider that the light quarks have the same chiral couplings : @xmath32 and we will allow different couplings for the third generation : @xmath33    for a more complete description of a large class of effective theories containing a gluon resonance as well as electroweak ( ew ) and fermionic resonances , look ref .",

    "is usually correlated with the yukawa couplings , leading to @xmath35 .",
    "however the quark content of the proton is mostly @xmath36 and @xmath37 quarks , thus at leading order in our model @xmath38 and @xmath39 only enter in the width of the resonance . as we discuss next , also the recent experimental results from tevatron prefer @xmath40 , leading to a resonance width mostly determined by the couplings @xmath41 . in this scenario top - pair creation in proton collisions",
    "are not sensitive to small differences between the couplings of the first and second generations , as long as they remain small compared with the couplings of the third generation , justifying our simplified assignment .",
    "the anomaly in @xmath42 measured at lep and slc can be solved if @xmath43 is partially composite , leading to larger couplings for @xmath43 than for the light generations .",
    "for this reason we consider @xmath44 as an independent coupling and allow it to be larger than @xmath34   @xcite . for @xmath45 , the resonance width is comparable to the resonance mass : @xmath46 , therefore we will consider an energy dependent width for the resonance .",
    "within the framework of the effective model considered in the previous section , we perform an analytic parton - level analysis of both the forward - backward asymmetry and the cross section of @xmath0 pair production at tevatron . the np contribution to @xmath48 production in tevatron",
    "comes from a gluon resonance exchange in the @xmath1-channel of the @xmath25 process . henceforth , in order to obtain a qualitative understanding of the asymmetry and the cross section at tevatron , we study the @xmath1-dependent tree - level parton formulae in the center of mass frame of the @xmath0 system . in the following section , we refine",

    "when considering @xmath0 as the final state , we can write the differential angular cross section in the center of mass reference frame of the @xmath0 system as @xmath51 where int and nps stand for _ sm - np interference _ and _ new physics squared _ , respectively . at tree - level , including only lo qcd and the gluon resonance contributions , the three different terms read @xmath52 the sm contribution corresponds to the @xmath1-channel gluon exchange diagram , the nps term is obtained by replacing the gluon by @xmath53 in that diagram , and int stands for the gluon-@xmath53 interference .",

    "finally , @xmath60 represents the mass of @xmath53 , @xmath61 is the energy in the center of mass frame of the @xmath48 system and @xmath62 is the velocity of the top in that frame .",
    "since the narrow - width approximation is no longer valid for large couplings , the use of a modified breit - wigner function is needed for the @xmath53 propagator in eqs .",

    "note that just the constant and @xmath64 terms contribute to @xmath12 , whereas only the @xmath65 term gives a contribution to the numerator of @xmath50 .    if the np effects in the cross section are small compared to the leading sm contribution , @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 contains both int and nps contributions ) , we can approximate @xmath11 by a^t_fb a_fb^t(sm ) + a_fb^t ( np )  , [ asym ] for each bin in the @xmath11 invariant - mass distribution .",

    "we use the nlo result for @xmath69 in order to take into account the sm contribution to the asymmetry .",
    "we have checked that the condition @xmath66 is satisfied in our simulations .",
    "the main point of this section is to gain a preliminar insight on which parameter space regions are favored by the experimental results . according to this ,",
    "we analyze eqs .",
    "( [ aes1]-[aes3 ] ) and look for general conditions to be fulfilled by the couplings .",
    "in particular , motivated by the not - unfolded data on @xmath50 ( see fig .  10 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we pursue to reproduce the peak around 650 gev as a resonant effect arising from a @xmath53 with @xmath70 gev and , at the same time , to produce small corrections to the invariant mass distribution in the cross section . as a first observation",
    ", we notice that the nps contributions to @xmath50 dominate over the int terms in the resonant region .",
    "since a positive asymmetry is measured in that region , for typical values @xmath71 gev , a first constraint is imposed on the couplings : @xmath72 .",
    "subsequently , it is also required @xmath73 in order to assure a positive pre - peak since int contributions may become competitive in the region @xmath74 where the pre - peak takes place .",
    "in addition , these two conditions imply that @xmath75 , giving positive and negative contributions to @xmath76 from int terms in the regions with @xmath74 and @xmath77 , respectively . in order to avoid large distortions in the @xmath76 invariant mass profile and significant deviations from the dijet final state invariant mass distributions ,",
    "we demand small axial and vector couplings for light quarks we satisfy this condition by assuming small chiral couplings. on the other side , we set large top chiral couplings for two reasons : ( i ) to make the @xmath53 effects detectable and ( ii ) to explain the @xmath78 shape by means of the presence of a relatively broad resonance we will see below that a narrow resonance does not lead to an agreement with the experimental results .",
    "besides , nps contributions to @xmath76 are always positive for any choice of couplings as we can read from eq .  ( [ aes3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect the cross section to increase in the resonant region .",
    "thus , we see that a delicate interplay between the size of @xmath53 width and its couplings to quarks for fixed values of @xmath60 dictates the experimentally allowed regions in the parameter space .",
    "it is worth to notice that a clear signal of the presence of a light resonance would be to detect an excess of events in the invariant mass distribution of @xmath50 and @xmath76 for @xmath1 values below the resonant peak and a defect above .",

    "now , with the aim to illustrate the way we use that argument as a guide to generate the simulations presented in the next section , we take a gluon resonance with @xmath82 gev as a typical example and analyze the role played by the couplings in the search of suitable @xmath50 and @xmath76 distributions .",
    "we also set , in this example , the quarks left couplings to zero to simplify the analysis . in fig .",
    "[ figsa ] , we show the analytical predictions for @xmath12 and @xmath11 at the parton - level ( these results have to be convoluted with the pdf s to obtain the physical values ) .",
    "for zero right couplings , we obtain the sm cross section at tree - level ( blue line ) and a null contribution to the asymmetry .",
    "now , to achieve the condition @xmath73 , we need @xmath79 and @xmath80 to have opposite signs the other constraint , @xmath72 , is then directly fulfilled. besides , as a relative large asymmetry is required , we set first both couplings to have an absolute value equal to 1 .",
    "this selection results in too large deviations from measurements and it is forbidden ( green lines ) .",
    "we reduce then the value of the light quark right coupling , @xmath85 , to produce a lower impact on the observables , however , this choice leads to a rather narrow resonance that still gives a large deviation in the resonant region ( brown lines ) .",
    "finally , in red lines , we find a possible solution .",
    "we see that the inadequate effect produced by a narrow - width may be changed by making the resonance broader .",
    "we keep a small value for @xmath79 but increase @xmath80 up to 5 , giving a width @xmath86 gev , which is of the same order as the typical values for allowed parameter space points found in the simulations .",
    "therefore , this analysis shows us the main ingredients to be taken into account and anticipates light - quark ( top ) chiral couplings of order @xmath87 .",
    "besides , there could be new channels open , for example if new coloured fermions @xmath88 were present , the processes @xmath89 and @xmath90 could be open whenever the available phase space allows them  @xcite .",
    "an alternative mechanism to explain the experimental data may occur in that case because @xmath91 would increase without the need of enlarging the couplings . in this work we assume that these channels are not open .    for large @xmath53 masses ( @xmath92 tev ) , the int term dominates in the whole @xmath1 range , always giving positive contributions to @xmath50 and @xmath76 . in order to have an agreement with @xmath50 , the couplings of the light quarks have to be @xmath93 1 because of the lack of a significant nps contribution in the resonant region . finally , the dependence on @xmath91 is smoother for heavy gluons than in the case of light gluons .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ aes2 ] ) and ( [ aes3 ] ) that the strength of the int and nps terms are controlled by the product of the light and top couplings . on the other hand , the @xmath53 width is given by a sum of light and top couplings squared ( and a secondary dependence on the mass of the quarks ) .",
    "therefore , when exploring the parameter space we have that if as it is going to be the case the light couplings are small and the top couplings large , then modifications to the width arise mainly from changes in the top couplings . on the other hand , variations in the strength of int and nps terms are equally sensitive to changes in both the light and top couplings .",
    "therefore , in a first approximation , if we need to modify the strength of the int and nps contributions without producing large variations in the @xmath53 width , we should only change the light - quark couplings ; if we need to modify the width , we should change the top couplings .",
    "this discussion will be helpful for the analysis performed in the next section .",
    "in this section we perform a numerical scan of the regions of parameter space pointed out by the previous paragraphs analytic study of the @xmath0 forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath11 ) and invariant - mass spectrum in the @xmath25 process . in this numerical scan",
    "we use madgraph / madevent @xcite ( mgme )   with cteq6l parton distribution functions  @xcite to simulate tevatron @xmath49 process and compute @xmath11 and @xmath13-spectrum at parton - level .    in order to test the different points in the parameter space",
    ", we compare our simulated @xmath11 results to the cdf two - bins unfolded result on this observable @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "given the lack of unfolded results in the recent experimental data on the @xmath13-spectrum @xcite , we interpret the experimental data as that there is agreement with the sm expectation .",
    "therefore , we simulate the @xmath13-spectrum using our model and using the sm and compare both results . in this last comparison we use in both simulations the same values for the top mass , and the factorization and renormalization scale .",
    "( in any case , we have checked that changes in these values within their allowed limits do not modify our results within the statistical error . )    in order to compare the forward - backward asymmetry results , we perform a @xmath94 test on the two bins of the unfolded data for @xmath11 . to compare the @xmath0 invariant - mass spectrum we also perform a @xmath94 test , but as follows .",
    "we divide the @xmath13 domain in @xmath95 gev bins up to @xmath96 gev and from there up we divide in three bins in @xmath97 , @xmath98 gev and greater than @xmath98 gev , in order to assure at least 5 events per bin in the sm simulated @xmath13-spectrum with @xmath99 ( the collected luminosity in the cdf results ) . to avoid large fluctuations we always simulate @xmath100 events , and for the @xmath13-spectrum we scale the results to the measured luminosity . in each @xmath94",
    "test we require @xmath101 to state agreement of the np model on the corresponding observable .",
    "we perform a scanning of two different regions in parameter space . in the first case , in order to obtain clean results , we set all the left couplings of the quarks to the new gluon to zero , and plot our results solely as a function of the light and top quarks right couplings .",
    "the motivation for this choice in the top quarks is simplicity and the existence of precision measurements in @xmath102-physics @xcite which constrain the couplings of the @xmath103 doublet to new gluons . in this scenario",
    "we have that axial and vector couplings are equal ; therefore the asymmetry at the resonance is positive ( see eq .",
    "[ aes3 ] ) . by setting opposite signs to the light and top right couplings",
    "we get a positive pre - peak in the asymmetry , as sought . in the second case",
    "we perform a random scan of all couplings in order to see the regions which have better agreement with @xmath11 and the @xmath13-spectrum .",
