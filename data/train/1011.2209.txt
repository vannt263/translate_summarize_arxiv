    "the ni  k@xmath0 fluorescent emission line has the potential to offer complementary diagnostics to the fe  k@xmath0 fluorescent line in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and some x - ray binary systems in which the fe  k@xmath0 line is detected ( e.g. , see torrejn et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) . in agns ,",
    "the narrow fe  k@xmath0 emission line is a ubiquitous feature of the x - ray spectrum of both type  1 and type  2 sources ( e.g. see shu , yaqoob , & wang 2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , since the abundance of ni is more than an order of magnitude less than that of fe , the ni  k@xmath0 line is expected to be weak .",
    "nevertheless , it has been detected in a few agns .",
    "three of the best examples are the circinus galaxy ( molendi , bianchi , & matt 2003 ) , ngc 6552 ( reynolds et al . 1994 ) , and ngc 1068 ( matt et al . 2004 ; pounds & vaughan 2006 ) . in all of these sources",
    "the equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath0 line is large ( hundreds of ev , to over 1  kev ) because the x - ray spectrum is dominated by , or has a relatively large contribution from , reflection in compton - thick matter .",
    "naturally , such sources are the most likely to yield detections of the ni  k@xmath0 line because its ew will also be correspondingly larger , in tandem with that of the fe  k@xmath0 line ew",
    ". the ni  k@xmath0 line has also been detected in a source that is not reflection - dominated , but still moderately absorbed ( centaurus  a ) , albeit with a lower statistical significance of detection ( markowitz et al .",
    "improvements in the sensitivity of x - ray detectors in the @xmath5  kev band aboard forthcoming x - ray astronomy missions such as _ nustar _ and _ astro - h _ will likely reveal detections of the ni  k@xmath0 emission line in a larger number of accreting x - ray sources and will therefore open up the opportunity to use the line as a diagnostic tool in conjunction with the fe  k@xmath0 line .    the results of model calculations of the flux and ew of a ni  k@xmath0 fluorescent line that originates in neutral matter , as expected in agns , have been reported in the literature for disk and spherical geometries ( e.g. , reynolds et al .",

    "our geometry is an azimuthally - symmetric doughnut - like torus with a circular cross - section , characterized by only two parameters , namely the half - opening angle , @xmath7 , and the equatorial column density , @xmath8 ( see fig .  1 in my09 ) .",

    "the anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) value for the solar ni abundance , @xmath34 , is @xmath35 relative to h. a more recent determination by scott et al .",
    "( 2009 ) yields a value of @xmath36 but the statistical and systematic uncertainties do not exclude the anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) value .",
    "we use the latter for consistency with our previous results on the fe  k@xmath0 emission line ( my09 ; yaqoob et al . 2010 ; yaqoob & murphy 2010 ) .",
    "the ni  k@xmath0 fluorescent emission line consists of two components , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , at energies @xmath39  kev and @xmath40  kev respectively , and with a branching ratio of @xmath41 ( bearden 1967 ) .",
    "these line energies are appropriate for neutral matter . in the monte carlo simulations we used a single line for ni  k@xmath0 , at a rest - frame monoenergetic energy , @xmath42 , of 7.472  kev ( obtained from weighting the @xmath37 and @xmath38 values with the branching ratio ) .",
    "we used a fluorescence yield , @xmath43 , for ni of 0.414 ( see bambynek et al .",
    "1972 ) and a ni  k@xmath44 to ni  k@xmath0 ratio of 0.135 ( consistent with results in bambynek et al .",
    "1972 ) .",
    "compared to my09 , the results in the present paper have a substantially higher statistical accuracy because they are based on monte carlo simulations with higher numbers of injected rays at each energy , and the calculations employ the method of weights ( as opposed to following individual photons ) . throughout the present paper we present results for power - law incident continua ( in the range 0.5500  kev ) , characterized by a photon index , @xmath45 , by integrating the basic monoenergetic monte carlo results",
    "( greens functions see my09 ) .",
    "in this section we discuss the flux of ni  k@xmath0 emission - line photons that escape the torus without any interaction with it ( the zeroth - order , or unscattered line photons ) . in  [ linecs ] we will discuss the scattered component of the line emission ( the compton shoulder ) . in practice",
    "it may not actually be possible to observationally distinguish the zeroth - order component of an emission line from its compton shoulder .",
    "the finite energy resolution of the instrument and/or the velocity broadening ( of all the emission - line components ) may confuse the two blended components of a line ( see discussion in yaqoob & murphy 2010 for the fe  k@xmath0 line ) .",
    "the monte carlo results for the flux of the zeroth - order component of the ni  k@xmath0 emission line are shown in fig .  1 as a function of the equatorial column density , @xmath8 , for each of the 10 angle bins in @xmath16 .",
    "the line flux , @xmath46 , has been normalized to an incident continuum that has a monochromatic flux of 1  photon @xmath47 at 1 kev .    as @xmath8",
    "is increased , the ni  k@xmath0 line flux first increases but then turns over , reaching a maximum for @xmath8 somewhere in the range @xmath48 , depending on the inclination angle .",
    "this is because the escape of ni  k@xmath0 line photons from the medium after they are created is significantly impeded by the absorption and scattering opacity that is relevant at the line energy . for the edge - on angle bin",
    "the maximum ni  k@xmath0 line flux is attained _",
    "well before the medium becomes compton - thick _ , at only @xmath49 .",
    "for the face - on angle bin the maximum line flux is attained at a higher column density ( @xmath50 ) , but still before the medium becomes compton - thick .",
    "the position of the turnover can be understood as approximately corresponding to a situation when the average optical depth to absorption plus scattering for the zeroth - order ni  k@xmath0 line photons is of order unity .",
    "the behavior of the ni  k@xmath0 zeroth - order line flux as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath16 is in fact very similar to that of the flux of the fe  k@xmath0 line , for which a detailed discussion can be found in yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .      in the optically - thin limit ,",
    "for which absorption and scattering optical depths in the @xmath51  kev band are @xmath52 , we can obtain an approximate analytic expression for the ni  k@xmath0 line flux .",
    "following yaqoob et al .",

    "thus , @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the k - shell fluorescence yield is given by @xmath43 , and @xmath55 is the yield for the ni  k@xmath0 line only . using our adopted value of 0.135 for the ni  k@xmath44/ni  k@xmath0 line ratio , @xmath56 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is the ni abundance relative to hydrogen ( @xmath35 , anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath57 is the ni  k shell absorption cross - section at the ni  k photoelectric absorption edge threshold energy , @xmath58 , and @xmath0 is the power - law index of the cross - section as a function of energy . for the verner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) data that we have adopted , @xmath59  kev , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ( obtained from fitting the k - shell cross - section up to 30  kev with a power - law model ) .",
    "the optically - thin limit for the ni  k@xmath0 line flux from equation  [ eq : thinflux ] is shown in fig .  1 ( dashed line ) .",
    "it can be seen that the monte carlo curves converge to this optically - thin limit , but only for column densities @xmath62 .",
    "note that the optically - thin limit for the ni  k@xmath0 line flux is _ independent of the details of the geometry_.    we can obtain a simple result in the optically - thin limit from equation  [ eq : thinflux ] for the ratio of the fe  k@xmath0 to ni  k@xmath0 line flux . neglecting the small difference in the energy dependence of the k - shell cross - section in ni and fe ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively ) , we have    @xmath65}{[a_{\\rm fe}/a_{\\rm ni}]_{\\rm ag89 } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in equation  [ eq : fenifluxratio ] , 7.124  kev is the neutral fe k shell threshold edge energy in verner et al .",

    "what is interesting about equation  [ eq : fenifluxratio ] is that not only is it independent of geometry , it is _ independent of the covering factor_.",
    "in fig .  2 , we show the ews of the unscattered ( zeroth - order ) component of the ni  k@xmath0 line as a function of the column density of the torus , @xmath8 , calculated for @xmath67 .",
    "the lower set of curves show the results for the non - intercepting angle bins , and the upper set of curves show the results for the intercepting angle bins , as indicated by the color - coded angle bin numbers .",
    "it can be seen in fig .  2 that inclination - angle effects become important for @xmath8 greater than @xmath68 .",
    "for inclination angles that do not intercept the torus , the ew peaks between @xmath69 , then decreases by more than @xmath70% of this peak value at @xmath8 @xmath71 . for these non - intercepting lines - of - sight ,",
    "the peak value for the ew of the ni  k@xmath0 line , for @xmath67 , is @xmath72 ev . for the lines - of - sight that intercept the torus , the ni  k@xmath0 line ew reaches its maximum value between @xmath73 , becoming as high as @xmath4  ev for the edge - on angle bin .",
    "overall , the behavior of the ew as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath16 is analogous to that of the fe  k@xmath0 line , for which a detailed discussion can be found in my09 .",
    "overlaid on the curves in fig .",
    "2 is the theoretical optically - thin limit ( dashed line ) , given by dividing equation  [ eq : thinflux ] by @xmath74 ( recall that the line flux in equation  [ eq : thinflux ] is normalized to a power - law continuum normalization at 1  kev of 1 @xmath75 ) .",
    "thus , the ew of the ni  k@xmath0 line in the optically - thin limit is    @xmath76    as in equation  [ eq : thinflux ] , the column density in equation  [ eq : thinew ] is the _",
    "mean , angle - averaged _ column density ( @xmath54 $ ] ) .",
    "in equation  [ eq : thinew ] @xmath42 is the ni  k@xmath0 line centroid energy .",
    "the ratio @xmath77 is @xmath78 .",
    "this happens to be very similar to the corresponding ratio for the fe  k@xmath0 line , @xmath79 .",
    "this leads to a very simple expression for the approximate ratio between the ew of the fe  k@xmath0 line and the ew of the ni  k@xmath0 line in the optically - thin limit , that is _ independent of the shape of the intrinsic continuum_. in analogy to equation  [ eq : fenifluxratio ] , we get    @xmath80}{[a_{\\rm ni}/a_{\\rm fe}]_{\\rm ag89 } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as was the case for the line _ flux _ ratio , the ew ratio in the optically - thin limit is independent of geometry _ and _ the covering factor .",
    "note that in the compton - thick regime , for lines - of - sight that intercept the torus , the ni  k@xmath0 line ew is larger relative to the fe  k@xmath0 line ew than simple linear scaling of the optically - thin case .",
    "in other words , the ew ratio in equation  [ eq : feniewratio ] becomes smaller as @xmath8 increases , for non - intercepting inclination angles .",
    "we find that the ratio has its smallest value ( @xmath2 ) for @xmath81 and an edge - on inclination angle .",
    "we note another important aspect of the ni  k@xmath0 line ew versus @xmath8 curves in fig",
    "that is , fortuitously , the relation for the optically - thin limit ( dashed line ) happens to give excellent agreement for the edge - on inclination angle bin all the way up to @xmath82 .",
    "this gives a very convenient way to analytically estimate the ew of the ni  k@xmath0 line for an edge - on orientation and a column density less than @xmath83 .",
    "we find that smaller values of @xmath45 yield larger values of the ni  k@xmath0 ew ; this is expected as there are relatively more photons in the continuum above the ni  k edge for flatter spectra .",
    "3 shows the ratio of the ni  k@xmath0 line ew for @xmath84 to the corresponding ew for @xmath85 , versus @xmath8 , for each of the 10 inclination - angle bins ( see table  1 in my09 ) . in the optically - thin regime , this ratio can simply be obtained by evaluating equation  [ eq : thinew ] for each value of @xmath45 and taking the ratio .",
    "we get a value of 1.465 , and this is shown in fig .  3 ( dashed line ) , from which it can be seen that there is excellent agreement with the monte carlo results .",
    "for the non - intercepting angle bins this ratio does not increase above @xmath86 even in the compton - thick regime .",
    "however , for the edge - on angle bin , the ratio has its maximum value ( with respect to all the angle bins and @xmath8 values ) of @xmath87 , for @xmath88 .",
    "the ew versus @xmath8 curves have an explicit dependence on the assumed opening angle of the torus .",
    "this is because different opening angles correspond to different solid angles subtended by the torus at the source and to different projection - angle effects . in the optically - thin regime , this dependence is linear . in the compton - thick regime , there is a more complicated dependence that must be determined by additional monte carlo simulations , which will be the subject of future investigation .",
    "in addition to the zeroth - order ( unscattered ) core of the ni  k@xmath0 emission line , the shape and relative magnitude of the scattered component of the ni  k@xmath0 emission line ( i.e. the compton shoulder ) are also sensitive to the properties of the reprocessor ( e.g. , see sunyaev & churazov 1996 ; matt 2002 ; watanabe et al . 2003 ; yaqoob & murphy 2010 ) . fig .",
    "4 shows plots of the ratio of the total number of scattered ni  k@xmath0 line photons to zeroth - order ni  k@xmath0 line photons ( hereafter , cs ratio ) versus @xmath8 . the ratios are shown for an input power - law continuum with @xmath67 , for the face - on and edge - on inclination angle bins ( see table  1 in my09 ) .",
    "it can seen that the cs ratio peaks at @xmath89 , reaching a maximum of @xmath90 ( face - on ) , and @xmath91 ( edge - on ) . these are @xmath92 and @xmath93 of the corresponding ratios for the fe  k@xmath0 line ( see my09 and yaqoob & murphy 2010 ) . for the face - on inclination angle ,",
    "the cs ratio for the ni  k@xmath0 line remains at @xmath90 once the maximum is reached ( even if the column density is increased further ) since the compton shoulder photons escape from within a compton - depth or so from the illuminated surfaces of the torus for lines - of - sight that are not obscured .",
    "for the edge - on inclination angle the cs ratio for the ni  k@xmath0 line declines as a function of column density after reaching its maximum value , due to a higher probability of absorption at higher column densities .",
    "we found that for all values of @xmath16 for the torus , there was no detectable difference in the cs ratio as a function of @xmath45 up to the @xmath8 value that gives the maximum cs ratio ( for a given value of @xmath16 ) .",
    "after that , the cs ratios diverge for different values of @xmath45 , with flatter incident continua giving larger cs ratios . for the face - on inclination angle the cs ratio at @xmath94 varies between @xmath95 to @xmath90 as @xmath45 varies from 2.5 to 1.5 . for the edge - on case , the cs ratio at @xmath94 varies between @xmath90 to @xmath96 as @xmath45 varies from 2.5 to 1.5 .",
    "flatter spectra have relatively more continuum photons at higher energies so that the ni  k@xmath0 line photons are produced deeper in the medium , increasing the average compton depth for zeroth - order line photons to scatter before escaping .",
    "these variations in the cs ratio with @xmath45 are likely to be too small to be detectable in practice .",
    "the _ shape _ of the compton shoulder of a fluorescent emission - line escaping from the torus also has a dependence on the column density and inclination angle of the torus .",
    "we found that the shapes of the compton shoulder profiles for the ni  k@xmath0 line are practically indistinguishable from the shapes of the fe  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder profiles ( see my09 and yaqoob & murphy 2010 ) .",
    "5 illustrates the shapes of the ni  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder ( solid lines ) for a power - law incident continuum with @xmath67 , for two column densities ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) and two inclination angles of the torus ( face - on and edge - on ) .",
    "corresponding compton shoulder profiles are also shown for the fe  k@xmath0 line ( dotted lines ) for comparison .",
    "the compton shoulder shapes shown in fig .",
    "5 have no velocity broadening applied to them .",
    "the compton shoulders are shown in wavelength space in units of the dimensionless compton wavelength shift with respect to the zeroth - order rest - frame energy of the emission line .",
    "in other words , if @xmath99 is the energy of a line photon , and @xmath42 is the zeroth - order line energy , @xmath100 . in order to facilitate a direct comparison of the compton shoulder profile shapes for different column densities and inclination angles , all of the profiles in fig .",
    "5 have been normalized to a total flux of unity .",
    "it should be remembered that the absolute flux of the compton shoulder varies significantly with column density , and the flux ratio for two column densities can be estimated using fig .  4 .",
    "yaqoob & murphy ( 2010 ) discussed the dependence of the shape of the fe  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder on @xmath8 and inclination angle in considerable detail .",
    "differences in the shapes of the compton shoulder profiles for the ni  k@xmath0 line and the fe  k@xmath0 line for the same model parameters only become apparent for @xmath101 and edge - on inclination angles . however , even at @xmath102 , the differences are less than @xmath103 . therefore , since the shapes of the compton shoulder profiles for the ni  k@xmath0 line are similar to the fe  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder profiles within the statistical uncertainties of the monte carlo simulations , we do not discuss the ni  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder further .",
    "the discussion and interpretation of the fe  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder in yaqoob & murphy ( 2010 ) can be applied to the ni  k@xmath0 line .",
    "we have presented some new results for the flux and ew of the ni  k@xmath0 fluorescent emission line from monte carlo simulations of a toroidal reprocessor illuminated by a power - law x - ray continuum .",
    "our results cover values of the equatorial column density , @xmath8 , of @xmath104 to @xmath98 , and the calculations were performed for a global covering factor of 0.5 and cosmic elemental abundances . as might be expected , the behavior of the ni  k@xmath0 line flux and ew as a function of the column density and inclination angle of the torus is similar to that of the fe  k@xmath0 line .",

    "the above results pertain to an incident power - law x - ray continuum with a photon index of 1.9 .",
    "flatter continua give larger ews and steeper continua give smaller ews .",
    "varying @xmath45 in the range @xmath84 to 2.5 can change the ni  k@xmath0 ew by up to @xmath93 in the compton - thick regime .",
    "we have given analytic expressions for the ni  k@xmath0 flux and ew in the optically - thin limit .",
    "we have also given simple analytic expressions , in the optically - thin limit , for the ratio of the fe  k@xmath0 to ni  k@xmath0 line flux , as well as the ratio of the fe  k@xmath0 to ni  k@xmath0 line ew .",
    "both of these ratios are independent of the geometry and covering factor of the reprocessor .",
    "moreover , we have found that the ratio of the fe  k@xmath0 to ni  k@xmath0 line ew is independent of @xmath45 , depending only on the fe to ni abundance ratio ( in the optically - thin limit ) .",
    "we have also investigated the compton shoulder of the ni  k@xmath0 line and we found that the ratio of the flux in the compton shoulder to that in the zeroth - order component of the line has a maximum value of @xmath90 and @xmath91 for face - on and edge - on inclination angles respectively .",
    "these are less than the corresponding maxima for the fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "however , we have found that the _ shapes _ of the ni  k@xmath0 and fe  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder profiles are indistinguishable within the statistical accuracy of the monte carlo results , except for edge - on inclination angles and @xmath105",
    ". however , even for @xmath8 as high as @xmath106 , the differences are less than @xmath103 .",
    "our calculations of the ni  k@xmath0 line flux , ew , and compton shoulder are meant to serve as a baseline reference because the detailed results , especially in the compton - thick regime , depend on a number of factors that have not been investigated here .",
    "the opening angle of the torus ( or effective covering factor ) may of course be different to the value used in the calculations .",
    "also , as suggested by lubinski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , part of the torus may be shielded from the x - ray continuum by the accretion disk . however , quantifying this is subject to uncertainties in the geometry of the x - ray source and accretion disk system .",
    "further deviations from the baseline model could occur if the torus does not have a circular cross - section and/or if the torus is clumpy ( e.g. , krolik & begelman 1988 ; nenkova , ivezi & elitzur 2002 ) .",

    "<S> we present new results from monte carlo calculations of the flux and equivalent width ( ew ) of the ni  k@xmath0 fluorescent emission line in the toroidal x - ray reprocessor model of murphy & yaqoob ( 2009 , mnras , 397 , 1549 ) . in the compton - thin regime , </S>",
    "<S> the ew of the ni  k@xmath0 line is a factor of @xmath1 less than that of the fe  k@xmath0 line but this factor can be as low as @xmath2 in the compton - thick regime . we show that the optically - thin limit for this ratio depends only on the fe to ni abundance ratio , it being independent of the geometry and covering factor of the reprocessor , and also independent of the shape of the incident x - ray continuum . we give some useful analytic expressions for the absolute flux and the ew of the ni  k@xmath0 line in the optically - thin limit . </S>",
    "<S> when the reprocessor is compton - thick and the incident continuum is a power - law with a photon index of 1.9 , the ni  k@xmath0 ew has a maximum value of @xmath3  ev and @xmath4  ev for non - intercepting and intercepting lines - of - sight respectively . </S>",
    "<S> larger ews are obtained for flatter continua . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the compton shoulder of the ni  k@xmath0 line and find that the ratio of scattered to unscattered flux in the line has a maximum value of 0.26 , less than the corresponding maximum for the fe  k@xmath0 line . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the shape of the compton shoulder profile for a given column density and inclination angle of the torus is similar to the corresponding profile for the fe  k@xmath0 line . </S>",
    "<S> our results will be useful for interpreting x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and x - ray binary systems in which the system parameters are favorable for the ni  k@xmath0 line to be detected .    </S>",
