    "in the case of the jack polynomials , the infinite - variable limit exists and is called the jack symmetric functions .",

    "the irreducibility of highest weight representations can be determined by special vectors called singular vectors in the highest weight representation .",
    "although the singular vectors have an integral representation , the expression formula of the jack functions by the dunkl operator @xcite is more useful .",

    "the macdonald polynomials are also simultaneous eigen - functions of commuting @xmath13-difference operators , now called macdonald difference operators .",
    "let us also mention that they are related to the ruijsenaars model @xcite which is a relativistic extension of the calogero - sutherland model .",
    "the @xmath13-deformation like the macdonald functions makes theory clearer and often mathematically easier to handle .",
    "for example , the jack functions can be characterized as the hamiltonian @xmath5 ( see footnote [ footnote : hbeta ] ) , but they have degenerate eigenvalues , and difficulties arise when we prove their orthogonality and coincidence with the singular vectors .",
    "in the theory of the macdonald functions , this degeneracy problem can be eliminated and the discussion is clearer .",
    "also , the hamiltonian @xmath5 has an infinite number of commuting operators .",
    "however , it is difficult to write down these operators explicitly @xcite , and in the macdonald theory we have an explicit formula for the commuting family of difference operators having @xmath14 as simultaneous eigenfunctions . for the above reason",

    "the representation theory of the virasoro algebra plays an essential role in the two - dimensional conformal field theories . in 2009 , while studying the low energy effective theory of m5-branes , alday , gaiotto and tachikawa discovered the correspondence between the correlation functions of two - dimensional conformal field theories and the partition functions of four - dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories ( agt conjecture ) @xcite .",
    "gauge theory has a long history and is an attractive theory studied by a lot of mathematicians and physicists .",
    "although it is difficult to calculate the partition functions of gauge theories in general , nekrasov gave an explicit formula ( nekrasov formula ) for the instanton partition function of four - dimensional @xmath30 supersymmetric gauge theory in 2002 @xcite .",
    "the nekrasov formula @xmath31 is written by the summation of the terms @xmath32 parametrized by tuples of young diagrams : @xmath33 these terms are given in a factorized form , and as @xmath34 increases , the amount of calculation becomes enormous .",
    "however , it can be calculated by a simple combinatoric method .",
    "the discovery of @xcite is the following relation between two - dimensional and four - dimensional field theories . the nekrasov formula for the four - dimensional @xmath35 gauge theory with four matters in ( anti-)fundamental representation ( actually , it is the nekrasov formula of the @xmath36 gauge theory divided by the @xmath2 factor @xmath37 ) coincides with the four - point conformal block of the two - dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "basics of the conformal field theories were established by belavin , polyakov and zamolodchikov ( bpz ) in 1984 @xcite .",
    "they described the critical phenomenon of the two - dimensional ising model which is a model of the ferromagnet , and so on .",
    "the primary fields @xmath38 are operators on the representation space of the virasoro algebra such that @xmath39=z^n\\left ( z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z } + h(n+1 ) \\right ) v(z ) , \\quad z , h\\in \\mathbb{c}.\\ ] ] the primary fields are the main research object in the conformal field theories . here",
    "@xmath40 is called the conformal dimension of the primary field . furthermore , in the conformal field theories , it is a fundamental problem to calculate the correlation functions of the primary fields . generally , in the quantum field theories ,",
    "the calculations of correlation functions are difficult , and usually it is often solved by approximation .",
    "bpz succeeded in determining the exact forms of correlation functions in the conformal field theories .",
    "in particular , they derived differential equations with regular singularities for the correlation functions .",
    "however , the research by bpz was performed mainly for primary fields with the special conformal dimension , i.e. the minimal models , and they did not investigate the correlation functions in general forms . even if we derive the differential equations of the correlation functions , it is difficult to find their solutions . from the standpoint of conformal field theories , the agt conjecture that states the agreement between the nekrasov formulas and the conformal blocks ( originally in the liouville theory , that is the theory having the primary field with generic conformal dimensions ) is studied under the expectation that general formulas for the correlation functions can be obtained .",
    "various extensions were made immediately after the agt conjecture was discovered .",
    "first of all , the original agt conjecture deals with the four - dimensional gauge theory in the case that the number of ( anti-)fundamental matters @xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "immediately after this original conjecture @xcite , the cases with @xmath43 were studied in @xcite .",
    "these cases can be obtained from the case of @xmath44 by applying the same degenerate limits to the nekrasov formula and the conformal block .",
    "especially when @xmath45 , the conformal block degenerates to the inner product of the vector @xmath46 called the whittaker vector of the virasoro algebra .",
    "case , the degenerate conformal blocks can be realized by the inner product of certain vectors that are the general form of the vector @xmath46 .",
    "] moreover , it is also expected that the four - dimensional gauge theories with the higher gauge group @xmath47 correspond with the @xmath27-algebra @xcite .    the jack functions and the macdonald functions also play an important role in the agt conjecture .",
    "for example , the expansion coefficients of the whittaker vector @xmath46 by the jack functions are clarified @xcite . in addition , it is known that a good basis called aflt basis @xcite can be regarded as a sort of generalization of the jack functions .",
    "the aflt basis is a basis in the representation space of the algebra @xmath48 , which is first introduced by alba , fateev , litvinov and tarnopolskiy , and the conformal block can be combinatorially expanded by this basis .",
    "the aflt basis is an orthogonal basis which parametrized by pairs of young diagrams @xmath49 . in the @xmath27 algebra case ,",
    "it is parametrized by @xmath0-tuples of young diagrams and exists in the representation space of the algebra @xmath50 . by inserting the identity @xmath51 with respect to the aflt basis @xmath52",
    ", the calculation of correlation functions @xmath53 is attributed to that of the matrix element @xmath54 , where @xmath38 is a sort of the primary field defined by some relations with generators of the virasoro algebra and the heisenberg algebra .",
    "then the three - point functions @xmath55 are factorized and coincide with the significant factors called the nekrasov factors , which compose the nekrasov formula .",
    "namely , if we expand the correlation functions by using the aflt basis , then the form of its expansion is quite the same as that of the nekrasov formula ( [ eq : nek formula ] ) .",
    "further , the conformal block of the algebra @xmath56 coincides with the partition function @xmath31 of @xmath36 gauge theory .",
    "actually , such a good basis does not exist in the representation space of the virasoro algebra .",
    "since the @xmath2 factor contributes and complicates the agt conjecture , we need the adjustment by the heisenberg algebra .",
    "since the aflt basis correspond to the torus fixed points in the instanton moduli space , it is also called the fixed point basis .    in @xcite ,",
    "the original agt conjecture is `` proved '' with the help of the aflt basis ( the generalized jack functions ) and the free field representation . in @xcite by using zamolodchikov reccursion relation . some proofs from geometric representation theory",
    "are also given in @xcite .",
    "] however , this `` proof '' is based on another conjecture .",
    "to explain it in more detail , recall that the free field representation of the conformal blocks can be written by the dotsenko - fateev integral @xmath57 , where @xmath58 means some integrals of the integrand @xmath59",
    ". then @xmath59 can be expanded by a sum of the products of the generalized jack functions @xmath60 and their dual functions @xmath61 , which are parametrized by tuples of young diagrams .",
    "this expansion formula is called the cauchy formula . at that time , it was conjectured that the integral value of each term @xmath62 directly corresponds to @xmath32 in the nekrasov formula .",
    "this is the scenario of the `` proof . ''",
    "although this proof is straightforward without using recurrence formulas etc , since the integral value of the generalized jack functions is still a conjecture , it is necessary to prove it in order to complete this proof .",
    "for that , we need to investigate more properties of the generalized jack functions",
    ".    @xmath13-deformed version of the agt conjecture is also provided .",

    ", it is shown that the inner product of the whittaker vector of the deformed virasoro algebra coincides with the instanton partition function ( k - theoretical partition function ) of the five - dimensional @xmath63 pure @xmath36 gauge theory .",
    "also the same approach as @xcite is taken in the @xmath13-deformed case .",
    "in other words , it is conjectured that the @xmath13-deformed dotsenko - fateev integral corresponds to the partition function with @xmath44 matters , and this conjecture is checked by using the generalized macdonald functions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13-deformed version of the aflt basis @xcite ( that is , the generalized macdonald functions ) exists in the representation space of the level @xmath0 representation of the ding - iohara - miki algebra ( dim algebra ) .    the dim algebra ( explained in appendix [ sec : def of dim ] ) has the face of a @xmath13-deformation of the @xmath64 algebra as introduced by miki in @xcite , and the deformed virasoro/@xmath1-algebra appear in its representation @xcite .",

    "furthermore , in the @xmath13-deformed case , awata - kanno s and iqbal - kozkaz - vafa s refined topological vertices @xcite are also reproduced by the matrix elements of some intertwining operator of the dim algebra , and the coincidence between the correlation function of the dim algebra and the 5d nekrasov formula is proved @xcite .",
    "the agt conjecture with respect to the @xmath13-deformed aflt basis @xcite ( recalled in section [ sec : reargument of di alg and agt ] ) is almost parallel to the undeformed case , and it suffices to consider the algebra @xmath67 , denoted by @xmath68 , which is generated by certain operators @xmath69 ( @xmath70 , @xmath9 ) obtained by the level @xmath0 representation of the dim algebra .",
