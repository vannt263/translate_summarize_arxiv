    "the observation of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) has now spanned over forty years . over that period ,",
    "many source models have been proposed to explain the origin of these remarkable events . in the past five years , theoretical models",
    "have been suggested that would potentially produce dipole distributions oriented towards m87 @xcite or centaurus a @xcite .",
    "in addition , the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) has reported findings suggesting a 4% dipole - like enhancement oriented towards the galactic center present in its events with energies around @xmath1  ev @xcite .",
    "this result seemed to be corroborated by findings published by the fly s eye experiment in 1999 that suggested the possibility of an enhancement in the galactic plane also at energies around @xmath1  ev @xcite , and also by a re - analysis of data from the sugar array that was published in 2001 @xcite that showed an enhancement in the general vicinity of the galactic center .",
    "however , both agasa and fly s eye are subject to a limiting factor ; they are both located too far north in latitude to directly observe the galactic center itself .",
    "the re - analysis of sugar data actually demonstrated an excess that was offset from the galactic center by @xmath2 and was more consistent with a point source than a global dipole effect @xcite .",
    "while the current high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) experiment is subject to a similar limitation in sky coverage as the agasa and fly s eye experiments , we will show that , by properly estimating the hires aperture and angular resolution , we can effectively exclude these dipole source models to a certain degree of sensitivity .",
    "however , we are not able to completely exclude the findings of agasa or the theoretical predictions mentioned above .    additionally , over the past decade , the search for sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) has also begun to focus upon small scale anisotropy in event arrival directions .",
    "this refers to statistically significant excesses occurring at the scale of @xmath3 .",
    "the interest in this sort of anisotropy has largely been fueled by the observations of the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) . in 1999",
    "@xcite and again in 2001 @xcite , the agasa collaboration reported observing what eventually became seven clusters ( six `` doublets '' and one `` triplet '' ) with estimated energies above @xmath4  ev .",
    "several attempts that have been made to ascertain the significance of these clusters returned chance probabilities of @xmath5 @xcite to 0.08 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the monocular ( and stereo ) analyses that have been presented by the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) demonstrate that the level of autocorrelation observed in our sample is completely consistent with that expected from background coincidences @xcite .",
    "any analysis of hires monocular data needs to take into account that the angular resolution in monocular mode is highly asymmetric .",
    "it is very difficult to compare the results of the hires monocular and agasa analyses .",
    "they are very different in the way that they measure autocorrelation .",
    "differences in the published energy spectra of the two experiments suggest an energy scale difference of 30% @xcite . additionally , the two experiments observe uhecrs in very different ways .",
    "the hires experiment has an energy - dependent aperture and an exposure with a seasonal variability @xcite .",
    "these differences make it very difficult get an intuitive grasp of what hires should see if the agasa claim of autocorrelation is justified . in order to develop this sort of intuition ,",
    "we apply the same analysis to both agasa and hires data .",
    "our methods for detecting the presence of a dipole source model and small - scale clustering are based upon comparisons between the real data and a large quantity of events generated by our monte carlo simulation program .",
    "the simulated data possess the same aperture and exposure as the actual hires - i monocular data set .",
    "we show how the asymmetric angular resolution of a monocular air fluorescence detector can be accommodated in this method .",
    "the data set that we consider consists of events that were included in the hires - i monocular spectrum measurement @xcite .",
    "this set contains the events observed between may  1997 and february  2003 .",
    "there were 1526 events with reconstructed energies above @xmath6  ev and 52 events with reconstructed energies above @xmath7  ev observed during this time period .",
    "the data set represents a cumulative exposure of @xmath8  km@xmath9sr@xmath10yr at @xmath11  ev .",
    "this data was subject to a number of quality cuts that are detailed in the above - mentioned papers @xcite .",
    "we previously verified that this data set was consistent with monte carlo predictions in many ways including impact parameter ( @xmath12 ) distributions @xcite and zenith angle distributions @xcite .",
    "for this study , we presumed an average atmospheric clarity @xcite .    in order to perform anisotropy analysis on this subset of data , we must first parameterize the hires - i monocular angular resolution . for a monocular air fluorescence detector ,",
    "angular resolution consists of two components , the plane of reconstruction , that is the plane in which the shower is observed , and the angle @xmath13 within the plane of reconstruction ( see figure  [ figure : picture ] ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     for this sample , we obtain @xmath14}=0.99352 $ ] .",
    "to study the relative sensitivity of agasa and hires - i , we measure the value of @xmath14}$ ] for multiple simulated sets with a variable number of doublets inserted .",
    "we then construct an interpolation of the mean value and standard deviation of @xmath14}$ ] from a given number of observed doublets for each experiment .",
    "this will allow us to state the number of doublets required for each experiment in order for the 90% confidence limit of @xmath14}$ ] to be above the background value of 0.99250 .",
    "in general , for a hires - i - like data set , the 90% confidence lower limit corresponds to the mean expected background signal with the inclusion of 6.25 doublets . for an agasa - like , the 90% confidence lower limit corresponds to the mean expected background signal with the inclusion of 5.5 doublets .",
    "this demonstrates that while agasa has a slightly better ability to perceive autocorrelation , the sensitivity of the two experiments is comparable .",
    "however , the observed hires - i signal corresponds to the 90% confidence upper limit with the inclusion of only 3.5 doublets beyond random background coincidence .",
    "we conclude that the hires - i monocular detector sees no evidence of clustering in its highest energy events .",
    "furthermore , the hires - i monocular data has an intrinsic sensitivity to global autocorrelation such that we can claim at the 90% confidence level that there can be no more than 3.5 doublets above that which would be expected by background coincidence in the hires - i monocular data set above @xmath7  ev . from this result , we can then derive , with a 90% confidence level , that no more than 13% of the observed hires - i events could be sharing common arrival directions .",
    "this data set is comparable to the sensitivity of the reported agasa data set if one assumes that there is indeed a 30% energy scale difference between the two experiments .",
    "it should be emphasized that this conclusion pertains only to point sources of the sort claimed by the agasa collaboration .",
    "furthermore , because a measure of autocorrelation makes no assumption of the underlying astrophysical mechanism that results in clustering phenomena , we can not claim that the hires monocular analysis and the agasa analysis are inconsistent beyond a specified confidence level .",
