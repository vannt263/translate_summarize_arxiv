    "axions have attracted considerable attention of elementary particle physicists and cosmologists over many years ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "although up to the present this particle has not been discovered experimentally , its possible parameters , such as mass and interaction constants with ordinary elementary particles , are the subject of much investigation .",
    "this is because the axion has become a crucial element of quantum chromodynamics , which proved to be the fundamental theory of strong interactions in agreement with numerous experimental results and part of the standard model .",
    "it is common knowledge , however , that in general terms the formalism of quantum chromodynamics leads to prediction of strong _ cp _ violation and large electric dipole moment for the neutron in contradiction with the facts . to avoid this contradiction , peccei and quinn @xcite introduced an additional global symmetry u(1 ) which is broken both spontaneously and explicitly in the lagrangian . as was shown by weinberg @xcite and wilczek @xcite , this results in the appearance of a light pseudoscalar particle called the _",
    "axion_. more recently , axions were widely discussed in astrophysics and cosmology as possible constituents of dark matter @xcite . in the process different kinds of axion fields have been used , specifically , introduced in string theory .",
    "though not all of them solve the problem of strong _ cp _ violation , they have generally similar properties and are axion - like particles . keeping this in mind",
    ", we will nevertheless use axion and axion - like particles more or less synonymously .",
    "the interaction of axion with photon is characterized by the coupling constant @xmath2 and is used in many experimental searches for this particle .",
    "the axion can also interact with electrons , protons and neutrons by means of pseudoscalar ( scalar ) couplings @xcite with respective coupling constants @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . the constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath3 were obtained in different experiments for various ranges of the axion mass ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "for example , rather strong constraint on @xmath2 was found from the search of solar axions with masses from 0.39ev to 0.64ev by using the cern axion solar telescope @xcite .",
    "the restrictive limits on @xmath2 follow from astrophysics by considering gravitationally bound systems of stars of approximately the same age ( the so - called _ globular clasters _ ) .",
    "these limits are applicable to axions of larger masses @xmath6kev @xcite",
    ". some constraints on @xmath7 were obtained from the study of processes with axions in stellar plasmas , such as the compton process and the electron - positron annihilation with emission of an axion @xcite .",
    "below , we deal with the constraints on @xmath8 and the coupling constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 characterizing pseudoscalar interaction of axion - like particles with nucleons .",
    "previously , constraints on these constants were obtained from the search of the compton - like process for solar axions and from the observation of the neutrino burst of supernova 1987a @xcite .",
    "many constraints were obtained in cosmology taking into account that axions should be produced in the early universe and contribute to dark matter @xcite .",
    "specifically , cosmological data exclude axions with mass @xmath11ev because they would provide a too large contribution to the hot dark matter @xcite .",
    "such kind limits , however , typically refer to specific couplings in some axion models and may be not applicable to all axion - like particles .",
    "broadly speaking , constraints on the parameters of an axion obtained from astrophysics and cosmology are also more model - dependent in comparison to table - top laboratory experiments @xcite . in refs .",

    "these experiments , however , deal with the unpolarized test bodies . as to the potential arising between two fermions belonging to different test bodies from the exchange of a single axion with a pseudoscalar coupling , it is spin - dependent @xcite .",
    "thus , there is no net force in casimir experiments due to a single axion exchange .",
    "it is not surprising , then , that these experiments have not been used in the past to obtain constraints on the axion - like pseudoscalar particles .",
    "nevertheless , a simultaneous exchange of two massless @xcite or two massive @xcite pseudoscalar particles between two fermions leads to a spin - independent interaction potential ( this was used in ref .",

    "here we use the same approach in application to the experiment on measuring the thermal casimir - polder force .",
    "the advantage of this experiment is that it was performed at comparatively large separation distances .",
    "we calculate the additional attractive force due to the exchange of two axions between fermions belonging to two test bodies in the experimental configuration .",
    "then , from the fact that no extra force was observed in addition to the casimir - polder force in the limits of experimental errors , we arrive to novel stronger constraints on the coupling constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "our constraints are obtained in the region of axion masses from @xmath17ev to 0.3ev .",

    "we have underlined that laboratory experiments for searching the axion and other axion - like particles are more model - independent than the numerous results found from different cosmological scenaria , astrophysics and astronomical observations .",
    "unfortunately , the already performed gravitational and optical laboratory experiments are only sensitive to axions of very small masses less or of order of @xmath131mev .",

    "this region overlaps significantly with the so - called _ axion window _ which extends from @xmath133mev to 10mev .",
    "the results obtained demonstrate that laboratory experiments on measuring the casimir force can be used not only for constraining the yukawa - type hypothetical interactions caused by the exchange of scalar particles or inspired by extra dimensions , but for placing limits on the parameters of the axion - like particles as well . for this reason in the future it is pertinent to analyze all",
