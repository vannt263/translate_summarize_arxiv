    "if @xmath5 is a symmetric space , the full invariant of a segment modulo the action of @xmath6 is precisely this vector - valued length since we can identify @xmath7 ( cf .",

    "an algebraic question ( the so - called _ eigenvalue problem _ ) , which goes back to 1912 when it was already studied by h. weyl , is closely related to a special case of the geometric question above , namely , for the symmetric space @xmath9 .",
    "it is one of the motivations for considering this geometric problem .",
    "the eigenvalue problem asks :    _ how are the eigenvalues of two hermitian matrices related to the eigenvalues of their sum ?",

    "is shown that the set @xmath10 depends only on the spherical coxeter complex associated to @xmath3 ( i.e. on the spherical weyl chamber @xmath11 ) .",
    "we will therefore sometimes refer to @xmath12 as the set of side lengths of @xmath1-gons in @xmath3 a symmetric space or a euclidean building with @xmath11 as spherical weyl chamber .    for a symmetric space @xmath5 the set of possible side lengths has been completely determined in @xcite :",
    "@xmath10 is a finite sided convex polyhedral cone and it can be described as the solution set of a finite set of homogeneous linear inequalities in terms of the schubert calculus in the homology of the _ generalized grassmannian manifolds _ associated to the symmetric space @xmath13 .",
    "it follows , that for a euclidean building @xmath14 with the same associated spherical weyl chamber @xmath11 as @xmath3 , the set @xmath15 is also a finite sided convex polyhedral cone determined by the same inequalities as @xmath16 .    as already pointed out in @xcite for the case of _ exotic _ spherical coxeter complexes ( i.e.  when it is the coxeter complex of a euclidean building but it does not occur for a symmetric space ) the structure of the set @xmath12 can not be described with this method , since we do not have a schubert calculus for these coxeter complexes .",
    "thus , the structure of @xmath12 for these coxeter complexes and even its convexity were unknown .",

    "the set @xmath10 which we are interested in is nothing else than the image of @xmath18 .",
    "we use a direct geometric approach to describe this image .",
    "our main idea is to study the singular values of @xmath18 by deforming the sides of a given polygon in @xmath3 .",
    "this strategy was already used for the case of symmetric spaces by b.  leeb in @xcite to give a simple proof of the thompson conjecture ( cf .",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) ) . in this paper",
    "we adapt this _ variational _ method to the case of euclidean buildings and use it to describe the space @xmath19 .    throughout this paper",
    "we state the results , whenever possible , in such a way that they apply to euclidean buildings of arbitrary rank . in particular , sections  [ sec : polygons ] , [ sec : criticalvalues ] and [ sec : crosswalls ] ( except lemma  [ lem : crossablewallsrank2 ] and proposition  [ prop : unionofcones ] ) do not use the assumption on the rank of the building .",
    "and when we do use the assumption , we indicate it explicitly in the statement of the corresponding result .    the set of inequalities obtained in theorem  [ thm : intro ] constitute an irredundant system defining the polyhedral cone @xmath19 . the inequalities given by schubert calculus in @xcite",
    "are known to be irredundant for the cases of type @xmath20 ( see @xcite ) , however , these seem to be the only cases . a smaller set of inequalities is given in @xcite by defining a new product in the cohomology of flag varieties .",
