    "modern computer graphics has experienced a paradigm shift : traditional manual modeling is increasingly complemented by data - driven techniques where measured data , such as 3d scans , are used as a basis for building 3d models .",
    "an important data source are 3d scans of deformable models , such as humans or animals in varying poses . today , there exist sophisticated scanning setups for acquiring moving geometry in real - time @xcite and there are even consumer devices on the market such as the microsoft kinect@xmath0 .",
    "this leads to new applications such as virtual cinematography @xcite , or the creation of data - driven generative shape models of deformable objects @xcite . finding correspondences among such data is a fundamental problem for all of these applications : almost any further processing , such as the registration of partial scans into a complete shape , editing of sequences , or statistical analysis , requires dense correspondences between surface points .    matching deformable shapes is in many cases a difficult problem : if we permit rather general deformations this might require many parameters that have to be explored during matching .",
    "the size of this search space is exponential with respect to the available degrees of freedom .",
    "however , for the important special case of a single object in different poses , we can often assume that the deformation is approximately isometric , i.e. , preserving the intrinsic metric structure .",
    "concretely , the distances along surfaces of objects such as humans , animals , plants , or cloths do not change a lot without serious injury or damage .",
    "this restriction leads to a strongly constrained search space .",
    "lipman and funkhouser  @xcite argue that isometries between topological disks are a special case of conformal mappings , thereby limiting the degrees of freedom to six ( three point - to - point correspondences are sufficient ) .",
    "ovsjanikov et al .",
    "@xcite show that a single point correspondence is sufficient for a special class of shapes where the spectrum of the laplace - beltrami operator is not degenerate , thus showing that there are only two degrees of freedom in this special case .",
    "additional cues , such as carefully selected constellations of local features @xcite , can even reduce the complexity for many shapes to the point of leaving a trivial search space , eliminating all degrees of freedom . as approximate",
    "isometry makes the correspondence problem feasible while still permitting significant pose changes , many of the recent shape matching algorithms are based on this assumption @xcite .",
    "however , the isometric matching problem is not yet solved : because of the intrinsic view of the geometry , it is naturally sensitive to topological noise . in case of holes ,",
    "missing data , or contacts , intrinsic distances become distorted and thus no longer constitute invariants that can be exploited for matching .",
    "one solution is to replace the notion of distance .",
    "for example , by using diffusion distances , or variants thereof , one can reduce the sensitivity to topological artifacts @xcite when the pieces of geometry that cause the problem are small in relation to the overall shape .",
    "nonetheless , these invariants still break down in case of large artifacts ( wide contacts , large holes , as shown for example in section  [ sec : results ] of this paper ) .",
    "unfortunately , real - world 3d scanner data , one of the main practical application areas , is almost universally troubled by substantial artifacts of this kind .    formulated",
    "more generally , we have to address the problem of _ partial matching _",
    ", where not the whole manifold can be brought into correspondence by a ( near- ) isometric mapping but only an excerpt of the surface can be matched . in this case ,",
    "typical invariants ( geodesic paths , laplacian eigenfunctions ) become unreliable because they utilize global information .",
    "importantly , the excerpts of the surfaces that can be matched are not known a priori ( otherwise , we could just restrict a traditional method accordingly ) but need to be determined along with the matching .",
    "this seems to re - introduce prohibitive complexity as we now have to choose from an exponential number of such subsets @xcite .",
    "the most important contribution of this paper is to show that with an appropriate matching model this is not the case .",
    "the search space is not much larger than in the global problem and we give an efficient algorithm for computing such matches .",
    "the core of our method is based on the observation from differential geometry that an isometric map can be fully specified by using local information up to first order only : an isometry between riemannian manifolds is fixed by a single point correspondence and an orthogonal map of the tangent spaces ( see for example  @xcite ) . in the case of surfaces ,",
    "this means that the map of a point and a local direction ( plus orientation , in case of unoriented surfaces ) is sufficient to determine an isometry .",
    "we will sketch a constructive proof in section  [ sec : proposed ] that directly yields a propagation algorithm for computing matches : starting with a single oriented point match , correspondence information is incrementally propagated to the neighborhood , thereby flood - filling a partially consistent region of isometric geometry .",
    "being local in nature , the method handles partial matches naturally and is robust to topological noise , which is reported naturally as boundary of partiality .    from a structural point of view",
    ", we can understand partial isometries among smooth , connected manifolds as equivalence classes of mappings of a pair of points and their tangent spaces on the two surfaces involved . in the case of oriented 2-manifolds",
    ", each such object has six degrees of freedom ( a point and an angle around the surface normal for each for source and target surface , respectively ) .",
    "the mapping is captured by a equivalence class of such 6-tuples .",
    "this set is redundant in that one degree of freedom ( the sum of the angles ) can be chosen arbitrarily and two further parameters ( either the starting or the end point ) are only needed to select the partial region to be mapped .",
    "this leaves three degrees of freedom that need to be actually explored densely , with false starting points being rejected in @xmath1 time . in this view , we can perform a relaxation : in order to also find _ approximate _ isometries , we can cast this problem as the task of finding _ approximate equivalence classes_. kim et al .",
    "@xcite have used this idea in the context of globally consistent isometric mappings in order to efficiently find approximate isometries . in our paper , we demonstrate how our partial matching framework can be adapted to perform the same task in a partial matching scenario .",
    "we perform agglomerative clustering  @xcite in the space of near - isometric mappings , which are concisely represented using the tuples introduce above .",
    "we validate our algorithm on standard benchmark data sets and raw scanner data , and compare the results to previous work .",
    "we show a significant improvement in quality over global methods in shapes with topological noise .",
    "our algorithm yields similar or better results as previous heuristics for partial matching , but with stronger guarantees of discovering existing isometries as outlined above .    in summary ,",
    "our paper proposes a systematic framework and new algorithms for extending isometric matching to the case of partial consistency , thereby making the following specific contributions :    * we characterize partial isometries of shapes by single - point maps up to first order , which yields a tight bound on the inherent degrees of freedom . *",
    "this leads to a novel matching algorithm that provides a systematic approach to the general setting of partial intrinsic matching , where both surfaces may be incomplete , including robustness to strong topological noise . * by interpreting partial matching as a problem of finding approximate equivalent classes in our novel representation , we obtain an algorithm for _ approximate _ partial isometric matching .    our algorithmic pipeline for approximate partial isometric matching is summarized as follows .",
    "we identify distinctive feature points on both surfaces .",
    "we compute oriented point correspondences by matching feature descriptors , with orientation determined by nearby features .",
    "from oriented point matches , we perform local metric propagation , stopping the propagation when the stretching becomes too large .",
    "this gives us a set of partial isometries , covering different , but possibly overlapping regions of both surfaces .",
    "we define a dissimilarity measure between partial isometries , and use this to cluster the partial matches into equivalence classes .",
    "the cluster ( equivalence class ) with the smallest total intra - cluster distance is merged by taking the geodesic centroid of all candidate correspondences for each point on the source manifold .    the steps in this pipeline exhibit sensitivity to certain challenges .",
    "most prominent are the sensitivity of feature matching to surface noise , missing data and topological noise , and the sensitivity of the clustering step to under - sampling of the space of isometric mappings , which can be exacerbated by problems in the feature matching stage , in addition to the lack of a proper distance metric between partial matches .",
    "the difficulty of reliable feature matching on real data can be alleviated by the metric propagation algorithm , which will typically produce smaller partial isometries for incorrect feature matches than for correct ones since we expect the local metric to be vary significantly for different parts of the surface .",
    "however , in the presence of strong continuous intrinsic symmetries this assumption breaks down .",
    "we thoroughly discuss and explore in which situations and to what extent these challenges create problems in the final result in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss different isometric matching models and their implications on the difficulty for finding a globally optimal solution to the matching problem . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this has not yet been analyzed explicitly in literature .",
    "we do not aim to give an extensive review of surface registration methods ; for this , we refer the reader to recent surveys such as van kaick et al .",
    "@xcite or tam et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we start by introducing some formal notations .",
    "* manifolds : * we consider smooth , orientable @xmath2-manifolds @xmath3 embedded in three - dimensional space . in order to represent partial data ( such as scans with acquisition holes ) , we permit boundaries , denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the orientation of @xmath5 might ( optionally ) be prescribed by oriented surface normals @xmath6 , @xmath7 , pointing outwards .",
    "* tangent space : * we further use @xmath8 to denote the tangent space of @xmath5 at point @xmath7 . for its representation , we choose two arbitrary but fixed orthogonal tangent vectors @xmath9 , i.e. : @xmath10 .",
    "* distances : * we use @xmath11 for @xmath12 to denote the _ intrinsic _ or _ geodesic distance _ between the two points @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "a _ geodesic _ connecting @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a curve that has no geodesic curvature , which means that the derivative of the curve at a point @xmath15 projected to @xmath16 is zero .",
    "we call the shortest geodesic connecting @xmath13 and @xmath14 a _ shortest geodesic path _ in @xmath5 .",
    "* mappings and isometries : * consider two manifolds @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and a mapping @xmath19 from an open subset @xmath20 to @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the partial derivatives of @xmath23 with respect to the tangent space directions @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xmath26 of @xmath17 .",
    "the first fundamental form @xmath27 of @xmath23 at point @xmath28 is then given by : @xmath29 the function @xmath23 is an _ isometry _ if and only if @xmath30 for all @xmath28 .    equipped with this notation , we will now identify and analyze three classes of approaches for finding surface correspondences .",
    "the difference is in how the notion of _ approximate _ isometry is handled , leading to different complexity characteristics and algorithms .",
    "the global model assumes that _ geodesic distances _ are _ global invariants _ of the shape , being consistent at least up to an error margin @xmath31 that accounts only for a small fraction of the object size .",
    "this means , the energy @xmath32 must be smaller than @xmath33 . for two points @xmath34 eq .",
    "( [ eq : globalapproxiso ] ) corresponds to an additive error of at most @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath35 the global consistency criterion is sometimes modified to allow for a multiplicative error of @xmath33 instead , as @xmath36 the former error model considers absolute errors , while the latter one considers relative errors .    in case of exact isometry ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath37 , the set of matching candidates becomes strongly constrained .",
    "the isometry assumption has been used to embed the intrinsic geometry of a shape in a euclidean space using multi - dimensional scaling , such that embeddings of isometric shapes become identical , which facilitates shape recognition and matching  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the geometry of shape @xmath38 can be embedded into shape @xmath39 using generalized multi - dimensional scaling , thereby computing a cross - parameterization directly  @xcite .",
    "exact isometry results in a set of matching candidates with few degrees of freedom . lipman and funkhouser  @xcite",
    "have noticed that isometries are special cases of conformal maps , thereby having only the degrees of freedom given by the mbius group , which are fixed by three pointwise matches on spherical topologies .",
    "ovsjanikov et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that even a single point match is sufficient to fix an isometry if the laplace - beltrami spectrum of @xmath38 is non - degenerate . in this paper",
    ", we exploit a different way to uniquely describe an isometry : fixing one point , a tangential direction , and the surface orientation is necessary and sufficient to specify an isometric mapping  @xcite .",
    "this provides the fewest possible degrees of freedom while still covering all cases including shapes with global intrinsic symmetries .    in case of small , global error margins ,",
    "statistical triangulation algorithms can be applied that compute all correspondences from a few landmark matches @xcite or , similarly , by voting for several approximate solutions @xcite .",
    "depending on the geometry of the shape , errors can become amplified so that a bit more than only the minimal set of initial correspondences are required @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , matching according to this model is efficient and can be considered a more or less solved problem .",
    "the global approximate isometry criterion has also been employed to study matching partial overlaps of complete surfaces .",
    "van kaick et al .",
    "@xcite use a pair of features to define a map that captures a local geodesic region between the two features , and show how this descriptor can be used for partial matching . here , using two features instead of one is crucial because two features encode orientation information on the surface , while one feature does not .",
    "the drawback of the global consistency model is its sensitivity to topological noise . to make globally consistent approaches more robust w.r.t .",
    "topological changes , several approaches have been proposed to perform a band - limited analysis in the eigenspace of the manifold s laplace - beltrami operator  @xcite .",
    "unlike prior approaches based on embedding the intrinsic geometry of the shape directly  @xcite , these approaches successfully handle small topological errors .",
    "however , they break down in the presence of large artifacts , such as wide contacts or missing pieces .",
    "a notable exception is the heuristic region growing approach by sharma et al .",
    "it tries to match points with similar spectral signatures using an expectation  maximization framework , which has been shown to perform well in the presence of large contacts .",
    "despite good practical performance , the algorithm is heuristic in nature and it remains unclear under which conditions it will find a correct solution .",
    "in particular , if local descriptors are not unique , the greedy region growing might fail and the em - algorithm does not guarantee to recover a correct global match .",
    "in contrast , our region growing algorithm , which is based on propagation of metric information rather than potentially ambiguous descriptor matching , comes with the theoretical guarantee to find correct results for exact isometries while requiring an initialization from a small search space with very few degrees of freedom .",
    "the global consistency model is incompatible with the notion of partial matching , since distances have to be measured on the complete surfaces @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which might not be available .",
    "xu et al .",
    "@xcite modify the criterion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : globalapproxiso ] ) by restricting paths to the partially matched region @xmath40 : @xmath41 note that @xmath42 considers again absolute errors @xmath43 and can be modified to consider relative errors as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : relativeerror ] ) .",
    "the drawback is that the shortest geodesic paths and thus the energy depend on the shape of the domain , which makes it difficult to optimize @xmath42 ; changing the domain @xmath40 influences which pairs of points are mapped in a geodesically consistent way .",
    "for this reason , xu et al . restrict their method to considering geodesically convex regions @xmath40 , which are defined as regions where for any two points @xmath44 in @xmath40 , there exists a shortest geodesic path between @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xmath40 . in this special case ,",
    "both @xmath42 and @xmath45 measure shortest paths on @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the solution proposed by xu et al . optimizes the scale of consistent regions and the consistent points separately , which leads to a rather complex algorithm .",
    "further , the notion of a scale parameter is not canonically related to the original matching problem .",
    "sahilloglu and yemez  @xcite consider the case where one of the surfaces is complete and the other an incomplete , deformed part of that surface . using a coarse sampling and matching strategy between shape extremities , they can directly estimate a scale parameter between the two surfaces , which allows them to define a scale - invariant isometric distortion measure .",
    "this results in one - sided partial dense intrinsic matching up to an arbitrary scale .",
    "their approach also allows matching of semantically similar , but non - isometric complete surfaces .",
    "our approach allows both surfaces to be incomplete , at the cost that they must be scaled consistently beforehand .",
    "given real - world scanners often provide data in known units , our method is compatible with the scenario of matching surfaces acquired with different modalities .",
    "while in this paper we do not explore the latter scenario , our approach would be compatible with this task given a reliable way to estimate scale change during metric propagation , possibly using shape extremities or other intrinsic features .",
    "bronstein et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a general framework to evaluate partial similarity using pareto optimality . in case of partial intrinsic shape matching , this method aims to find large parts of two surfaces that are similar to each other , where similarity is measured according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : absoluteerror ] ) . in practice",
    ", the parts are found using generalized multi - dimensional scaling .",
    "raviv et al .",
    "@xcite use a similar technique to find partial intrinsic symmetries .",
    "another common way to relax the requirement of exact isometry towards approximate matching is to maintain the metric tensor in a least - squares - sense .",
    "again , let @xmath46 be a mapping between two manifolds , where @xmath40 is the open subset of @xmath17 that should be mapped to @xmath39 in a distortion minimizing way . we can measure the distortions for example by minimizing a matrix norm of the green deformation tensor ( difference of the first fundamental form to identity ) : @xmath47 this criterion is purely local and thus well suited for partial matching .",
    "it is worth noting that extrinsic elastic deformation techniques , such as @xcite are closely related : they either include the preservation of the curvature tensor in the objective function to maintain the extrinsic shape , or apply eq .",
    "( [ eq : localapproxiso ] ) to the 3-manifold of the embedding euclidean volume @xcite .",
    "all of these methods are designed for partial matching .",
    "the problem with both intrinsic and extrinsic elastic matching models is that the search space becomes very large , rendering any approach based on exhaustive search prohibitively expensive .",
    "the structure of the search space can be approximately understood by a linearized analysis . in order to understand the degrees of freedom of the local matching model",
    ", we can use the tool of modal analysis of such elastic models , first introduced by pentland and williams  @xcite to the field of computer graphics ( the aim of their paper was actually to speed up the simulation of extrinsic elastic deformations of solid objects in three - space ) .",
    "modal analysis represent the deformation of an object as a linear combination of the eigenmodes of the object s vibration , which are found using a spectral analysis of a linearized deformation energy .",
    "typically , these energies are related to the laplacian of the deformed domain , thus leading to eigenvalues that are only decreasing rather slowly .",
    "many modes need to be retained to represent the space of low - energy ( i.e. , plausible ) deformations adequately . if the local matching is not very stiff , the size of the search space explodes .",
    "this is intuitive : permitting local deformations creates a large variety of permissible shape variants , for example by adding different local dents and combinations of those everywhere . due to this large search space , it is impractical to match shapes purely based on the deformation model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : localapproxiso ] ) . in order to reduce the large search space for elastic matching ,",
    "existing methods use additional constraints , such as , template models  @xcite , temporal coherence  @xcite , or fairly large sets of coherent feature correspondences  @xcite .",
    "recently , kim et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a new paradigm for the elastic matching problem .",
    "first , the method computes multiple dense maps between two shapes by assuming a global near - isometric deformation model .",
    "multiple maps are obtained by fixing different triples of corresponding points for the computation of global conformal maps  @xcite .",
    "second , the method computes local weights for pairs of maps , depending on their local adherence to isometry , and performs a spectral analysis to combine multiple weighted maps into a single global map .",
    "the key idea is to find cliques of similar mappings by clustering approximately compatible maps .",
    "the method was shown to perform well in many interesting cases .",
    "however , it can not handle partial mapping ; in particular constellations with large topological noise can not be handled : each global conformal map can is highly distorted due to the lack of global consistency .",
    "this introduces distortions in many of the local matches , and it is not always possible to remove these distortions in the final blended result ( as demonstrated in section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "our clustering method ( section  [ sec : pairwise_clustering ] ) is based on the same idea , but it combines _ partial maps _ instead of _ global maps _ , therefore avoiding the mentioned problems of artifacts due to only partial consistency . on the technical side ,",
    "the main challenge is that we can not measure the distance between all pairs of candidate maps but only between actually overlapping ones .",
    "this is a problem for the original spectral clustering , which we substitute by an alternative technique geared towards sparse pairwise constraints @xcite .      in previous work ,",
    "there have been a number of attempts to find local isometric mappings , similar to our approach",
    ". however , these did not consider mappings between general surfaces but only local planar parametrizations .",
    "different techniques have been proposed to locally parameterize the intrinsic geometry of a surface to a plane using a local approximate isometry criterion .",
    "schmidt et al .",
    "@xcite used exponential maps to transport a local coordinate system along a surface for the purpose of texture mapping .",
    "more recently , schmidt  @xcite used transported exponential maps to produce a parameterization of a local surface patch to the plane that has low metric distortion .",
    "the local surface patch is provided through user interaction as an input stroke on the surface .",
    "malvaer and reimers  @xcite propose an alternative parameterization based on an extension of polar coordinates to surfaces . in our work ,",
    "we cross - parameterize local surface patches from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "this cross - parameterization is more challenging than a parameterization to the plane due to the arbitrary geometry of @xmath39 .",
    "our cross - parameterization task is further complicated as in our application scenario , both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are scanned point clouds with missing surface information and scanner noise .",
    "hence , the reviewed methods can not be applied in a straight forward manner in our application .",
    "we saw that for general surface matching using a global approximate isometry criterion for partial matching ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : globalapproxisoxu ] ) ) is difficult since the domain changes , and that using a local approximate isometry criterion ( eq .  ( [ eq : localapproxiso ] ) ) is difficult since this results in a large search space . in this section",
    ", we outline our new method : starting from a point @xmath48 and attached direction in @xmath49 with known correspondence @xmath50 and corresponding attached direction in @xmath51 , we find the largest domain @xmath40 such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : absoluteerrorpartial ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the key assumption of our approach is that @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be matched using a global approximate isometry in some partial region @xmath40 containing @xmath15 , implying that eq .",
    "( [ eq : absoluteerrorpartial ] ) holds .",
    "our goal is to find the largest region @xmath40 for which this assumption is satisfied .",
    "this assumption holds in scenarios where we know that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are actually related by a near - isometric map but the data does not comprise all of the original input and/or contains additional unrelated geometry or contacts .",
    "the most important practical example where this assumption holds is the acquisition of a surface that deforms near - isometrically but the scanning equipment introduces areas of missing data ( shadowed to the scanner by other object parts ) and can not correctly resolve the topology in contact areas ( such as the hand of a person being in contact with the body ) .",
    "our approach can be viewed as a hybrid approach between global and local approximate isometric matching .",
    "we use the assumption that @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be matched using a global approximate isometry in some partial region @xmath40 , and we compute @xmath40 by growing a region using a local approximate isometry criterion .",
    "this allows us to combine the advantage of the global methods of having a low - dimensional search space with the advantage of the local methods of being well suited to describe partial isometric matches .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the parameter domain of all partial isometric matchings between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "our goal is to compute all partial isometries @xmath53 that map maximal subsets @xmath40 of @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the vector @xmath54 parametrizes the set of all such mappings .    in the following",
    ", we will discuss that :    * isometric deformations of @xmath17 have three degrees of freedom .",
    "* a partial isometry can be parametrized by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the unit circle .",
    "* there exists a global representation redundancy that identifies all choices of parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "the following proof sketch aims to give the intuition behind this statement for 2-dimensional surfaces embedded in @xmath62 by showing that we can transfer the local coordinate frame defined by @xmath59 and @xmath61 to any point on @xmath17 in a canonical way .",
    "we start with two definitions .",
    "injectivity radius @xmath63 _ at @xmath15 is the largest radius , such that for any point @xmath13 on @xmath17 with geodesic distance less than @xmath63 from @xmath15 , there is a unique shortest geodesic path between @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",
    "injectivity radius of @xmath17 _ is defined as @xmath64 .    for closed surfaces ,",
    "the injectivity radius can be bounded from below by the minimum of @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the gaussian curvature , and half of the length of the smallest periodic geodesic  ( * ? ? ?",
    "it follows that @xmath67 holds for closed riemannian surfaces with finite gaussian curvature . for general surfaces with boundary ,",
    "the injectivity radius may become zero .",
    "note that in this paper , we consider riemannian surfaces with finite gaussian curvature with boundaries .",
    "the boundaries are present because the closed riemannian surface of interest is only partially observed by the acquisition device . in this special case ,",
    "the injectivity radius is still positive .",
    "imagine that @xmath17 is covered by overlapping regions of intrinsic radius less than @xmath68 .",
    "these regions are all topologically equivalent to disks . consider a disk @xmath69 containing a point @xmath15 as shown in figure [ fig : paralleltransport ] . in a small neighborhood of @xmath15",
    ", @xmath69 is arbitrarily close to the tangent plane @xmath60 .",
    "note that @xmath15 , @xmath59 , and @xmath61 fix a local orthonormal coordinate frame in @xmath62 .",
    "this coordinate frame can be transported to a point @xmath70 along the ( unique ) shortest geodesic path @xmath71 from @xmath15 to @xmath13 in @xmath69 by parallel transport , which can be thought of as repeatedly projecting the direction @xmath59 to the tangent planes of consecutive points along @xmath71 in infinitesimally small steps ( for details on parallel transport see for example berger  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3.1 ) ) .",
    "let @xmath72 denote the transported direction .",
    "the transferred direction lies in the tangent plane @xmath73 , and can again be used to fix a local orthonormal coordinate frame at @xmath13",

    "note that by construction , we only use intrinsic information to propagate the direction @xmath59 to the entire surface .",

    "starting from the corresponding points @xmath15 and @xmath80 along with the corresponding directions @xmath59 and @xmath78 , we can propagate the correspondence information to a sufficiently small geodesic neighborhood @xmath81 of @xmath15 by simultaneously walking along corresponding geodesic paths starting at @xmath15 and @xmath80 , respectively , and by matching points that are reached at the same time .",
    "here , @xmath81 is sufficiently small if its geodesic radius is below @xmath68 .",
    "once the correspondence information is computed for @xmath81 , we continue propagating the correspondence information from a point close to the boundary of @xmath81 to its geodesic neighborhood , and iterate until every point on @xmath17 has a correspondence .",
    "the assumption that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are ( near- ) isometric can also be used to detect the boundary of the largest region @xmath20 containing @xmath15 for which the mapping is near - isometric .",
    "the reason is that the propagation algorithm allows us to measure the difference in intrinsic geometry in newly mapped parts of @xmath17 and @xmath18 directly .",
    "hence , we can stop the region growing algorithm if a newly added correspondence would induce a stretching larger than @xmath33 .",

    "this way , the largest near - isometric partial match is identified , as shown in figure  [ fig : growingd ] .",

    "merely rotates the field of directions @xmath72 in @xmath73 ( and similarly , the field of corresponding directions @xmath82 in @xmath83 ) .",
    "hence , the choice of this direction has no influence on the final result . to remove this redundancy , we start from an arbitrary but fixed direction @xmath59 and precompute and fix @xmath72 for all @xmath13 on @xmath17 .",
    "the second redundancy is the choice of the start point @xmath15 .",

    "in practice , we can take advantage of this representational redundancy as follows . since @xmath17 and @xmath18 are discretized and corrupted by noise , the error of the correspondence information computed using the propagation algorithm increases with increasing distance from the start point of the propagation .",

    "this experiment illustrates the difference between a global isometric matching model and partial one : the two surfaces are globally non - isometric , but the planar part is isometric . in this example , we use two ground truth correspondences to initialize both algorithms to remove differences due to different feature matching approaches . since hkm aims to map the shapes using a global isometry , the result maps planar parts to the peaks , while our method successfully detects the largest part of the surfaces that can be isometrically mapped .",
    "+   +   +      next , we consider acquisitions of real - world data that was processed by fitting a template shape to the raw data . for all experiments in this section , we use @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "we first use two frames of the samba sequence by vlasic et al .",
    "these frames are locally very close to isometric , but globally have high non - isometric distortion due to the dress being connected to the legs .",
    "we therefore set @xmath174 in the clustering step .",
    "vlasic et al .",
    "provide a processed version of the frames , where a template was fitted to the data .",
    "this processing ensures that the models have the same topology , and the processed data can be used as ground truth correspondence .",
    "we compare our method to hkm and bim using the processed frames of the samba sequence .",
    "figure  [ fig_samba_clean ] shows the results .",
    "note that while hkm leads to a result with visual artifacts , the results of bim and our method are visually pleasing .",
    "furthermore , since we have ground truth correspondences , we show the cumulative error distributions for all three methods in figure [ fig_samba_plot ] . here , geodesic error is measured as a fraction of the square root of the surface area of @xmath18 .",
    "note that our method numerically outperforms the two other methods .",
    "+    . ]",
    "the experiments conducted so far have shown that hkm , while being based on a solid theoretical foundation , leads to results of low quality when the aim is to find dense correspondences in datasets that contain noise and non - isometric distortion .",
    "hence , in the following , we exclude this method from our comparisons .",
    "second , we test our algorithm on the scape dataset  @xcite consisting of 71 scans of a male scanned in different postures . in our experiment , we match the neutral posture to all 70 remaining postures using bim and our approach .",
    "the cumulative error distributions for all 70 mappings are shown in figure [ fig_scape_plot ] .",
    "this data differs from the samba frames in that it is globally near - isometric , but contains local areas of high - distortion ( at joints for example ) .",
    "for this reason it provides a different kind of near - isometric test , and poses a greater challenge for our method , which does not exploit global assumptions .",
    "this is reflected in our error curve being below that of bim .",
    "we set @xmath175 in this experiment to reduce the influence of partial isometric patches that were thrown off by high local distortions .",
    "finally , we consider raw scan data acquired using different acquisition systems .",
    "this type of data is noisy and incomplete , and is therefore significantly more challenging to match than the data used in the previous experiments . by using data from a variety of acquisition systems ,",
    "we show our methods robustness to different types of acquisition noise .",
    "we also show our method s robustness to other acquisition artifacts that violate global isometry : large holes and contacts .",
    "first , we use the same two frames of the samba sequence by vlasic et al .",
    "@xcite that were used above .",
    "however , this time , we consider the geometry reconstructed by a space - carving algorithm rather than template fitting . in this case , the frames we choose have different topology ( as the hands merge with the body at the hips in one of the models ) and are severely corrupted by noise . for this reason , we set @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath176 .",
    "we use these models to compare our method to bim , tevs et al.s method , and sharma et al.s method .",
    "figure  [ fig_samba_contacts ] shows the results .",

    "match parts of the body of @xmath17 to the arms and legs of @xmath18 , thereby leading to visual artifacts .",
    "( see enlarged areas in figure [ fig_samba_contacts ] . )",
    "the method of sharma et al .",
    ", which is especially well suited to the scenario of handling contacts , leads to a result that covers the surfaces well . for this example",
    ", our method is run using two feature sets : first , using the standard features of our method and second , using the same image - based features used by sharma et al .",
    "our method produces a visually accurate mapping in both cases .",

    "the improved performance with image - based features illustrates some of the technical challenges .",

    "we now discuss some limitations of our algorithm .",
    "our algorithm is based on growing near - isometric mappings between partial regions of two surfaces and then clustering consistent mappings together . in this way",
    ", our algorithm enumerates a set of near - isometric mappings . for models that exhibit a large number of partial intrinsic symmetries ,",
    "this technique enumerates a large set of near - isometric mappings where many of the mappings are inconsistent with each other .",
    "since we stop growing new near - isometric regions after the first 200 oriented feature point matches have been considered , for shapes with a large number of partial near - isometric symmetries , it may happen that there is no cluster of consistent mappings covering a large area of @xmath17 .",
    "an example where the clustering step fails to identify a cluster of consistent mappings covering a large area of @xmath17 is shown in figure  [ fig_flashkick ] .",
    "the two frames of the flashkick dataset  @xcite contain a large topological change due to a merge of the subject s pants in one of the models .",
    "note that our algorithm correctly stops the growing of single partial mapping in this area , as shown in figure  [ fig_flashkick ] .",
    "however , since the legs and core of the target body are intrinsically symmetric ( similar to cylindrical ) , many inconsistent partial mappings are found by the algorithm , and they can not be clustered in a consistent way .",
    "we should also note that the computational costs are quite high .",
    "this is partially due to unoptimized code , but an algorithmic shortcoming is the rather simple feature - matching algorithm for finding start positions and directions .",
    "optimizing this was not the focus of this work ; our method should rather be understood as an alternative for the dense matching step where it can replace previous approaches based on conformal maps  ( @xcite and follow - ups ) , heat - kernel maps ( @xcite and follow - ups ) , or geodesic triangulation with landmarks ( @xcite and follow - ups ) in order to handle partial matching .    for future work , to address this limitation",
    ", we plan to combine our approach with an approach that detects continuous intrinsic symmetries  @xcite , thereby reducing the search space for the initial feature matching and allowing us to efficiently enumerate all partial matches .",
    "similarly , our framework could be extended to find partial intrinsic symmetries within a single object .",
    "we have analyzed the complexity of the isometric matching problem under global and local isometry assumptions and based on this analysis we have introduced a new approach to solve the partial isometric matching problem using a representation for partial isometries that is both low - dimensional and redundant .",
    "underpinning this is the fundamental observation that isometric mappings can be determined using purely local information and have only three degrees of freedom on 2-manifolds .",
    "the local metric propagation algorithm we derived from this observation is designed to handle topological noise that could affect large portions of the model , including both large holes and contacts .",
    "the redundancy in the representation can be exploited to increase robustness of and to combine partial matches.we have shown how a direct implementation of this theoretical framework can be used to match challenging surfaces with different types of topological noise .",
    "the insights gained by studying the partial isometric matching problem have the potential to impact other shape processing tasks .",
