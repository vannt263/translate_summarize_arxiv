    "the band splitting in the insulator due to the exchange interaction will lead to different tunnel barrier heights for spin - up and spin - down electrons , resulting in a finite spin polarization of the tunneling current .",
    "this is called the spin - filter effect .",
    "+ since a mtj is build by coupling materials with in general different chemical potentials , it is inherently out of thermal equilibrium . therefore the usual many - body description has to be modified .",

    "heide et al.@xcite investigated the relation between the current and the interlayer exchange coupling . a similar model to the one presented in this paper",
    "was used by zeng et al.@xcite to calculate transport properties in hybrid structures .",
    "they use ferromagnetic and superconducting leads with a non - magnetic central region while in our case the situation is reversed .",
    "+ most experiments on spin filtering were done with europium chalkogenide barriers and metallic contacts .",

    "this is done in appendix [ sec : appg ] . at this point of the calculation",
    "it is necessary to specify the interaction @xmath18 in the insulator , which is assumed to consist of localized moments .",
    "since there are also itinerant electrons ( through tunneling ) in the insulator , the klm is considered to be an appropriate model for this region .",

    "+ due to the complicated structure of the self - energy , especially the green s function in the denominator , one has to be careful when applying the analytic continuation rules . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appg ] a method is shown how it can be incorporated in the keldysh formalism .",
    "in each of the three regions of the tunnel junction there is only one s - like band which is described in a tight - binding picture . therefore each band",

    "furthermore we choose the zero point of energy to coincide with the band centers of the leads when no voltage is applied : @xmath57 .",

    "the last two parameters play a special role because for the description of a concrete experiment all the other ones are fixed .",

    "@xmath64 will decrease the overall strength of the coupling with increasing thickness of the insulator for @xmath65 .",

    "the insulator states near the fermi energy are additionally enlarged for clarity . ]    in this section both leads consist of the same normal metal . before beginning a systematic evaluation of the model it is useful to get a better understanding of how hybridization can be used to model tunneling . in figs .",
    "[ fig : princmim1 ] and [ fig : princmim2 ] the qdos of the three regions are shown , with and without tunnel coupling @xmath71 . since there is no direct contact between the two leads , electrons can only get from the left to the right metal by hopping through the insulator . in the case",
    "@xmath76 this is not possible , because there are no allowed states in the energetic region of the occupied metal states . if the tunnel coupling is turned on , there will be allowed metal states in the energetic region of the insulator and vice versa .",
    "therefore hopping between the layers becomes possible .",
    "of course there still wo nt be a net current without an applied voltage .      a typical current profile for a one - layer insulator is shown in fig .",

    "the right metal gets shifted downwards compared to the left one . for small voltages",

    "therefore the current increases in a linear way , too . when there is a maximal number of occupied states lying opposite to unoccupied states the current reaches its maximum . for higher voltages it decreases again and will become zero when the voltage exceeds the band width of the metal ( 5 ev in this case ) , because then there is no overlap between the two bands anymore .",
    "this bevavior is the same for both spin directions , but obviously the spin - up current is higher over the whole voltage range , i.e. there is a finite spin polarization .",
    "the reason behind this is the energetic distance between the metal and insulator bands . for the spin - up bands this distance is less than for spin - down , resulting in a stronger effect of the hybridization , which in turn will lead to a higher current .",

    "for all the other parameters it is qualitatively the same as the shown curves .",
    "in the following list we will explain these curves : + band width of the metals @xmath58 : + increasing the width of the metal bands automatically decreases the maximum of the qdos .",
    "this is shown in the inset .",
    "a decrease of qdos means that there are less electrons which can tunnel and at the same time less empty states which they can tunnel into .",
    "both effects reduce the current . +",
    "band width of the insulator @xmath59 : + by increasing the band width of the insulator and leaving its center of gravity constant the height of the tunnel barrier gets smaller . in the model",
    "this corresponds to a higher hybridization strength because the energetic distance between metal and insulator bands decreases .",
    "so one expects an increase of current .",
    "+ band center of the insulator @xmath60 : + the explanation of this effect is similar to the band width .",
    "the band center of the insulator is directly proportional to the height of the tunnel barrier . shifting the band to higher energies will lower the current .",
    "+ exchange coupling @xmath49 : + the dependence of the current on @xmath49 can only be understood by looking at the spin - dependent contributions shown in the inset .",
    "the spin - down current decreases slightly while the spin - up current shows a strong increase resulting in an increase of the total current .",
    "this behavior can be explained with the help of the @xmath60-curve . for @xmath78",
    "ev both spin - down and spin - up bands have the same center of gravity . increasing @xmath49",
    "shifts the spin - up band to lower and the spin - down band to higher energies ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : expl_j ] and [ fig : isa_j ] ) .",
    "it can immediately be seen from the picture that there will be a slight decrease in spin - down current and a bigger increase of spin - up current .",
    "+ band occupation @xmath25 : + if the metal band is completely occupied ( n=1 for both spin directions ) or completely empty , it becomes an insulator and the current vanishes . for small @xmath25",
    "there is only a small amount of electrons in the left metal which can tunnel .",
    "vice versa , for high @xmath25 there is only a small amount of unoccupied states in the right metal which can be tunneled into . for half filling",
    "there is an unoccupied state in the right metal for every electron in the left metal .",

    "but the result of the model calculation shows that the curve is shifted asymmetrically to higher band occupations .",
    "the reason behind this is that the distance between fermi energy and the lower band edge of the insulator is smaller for high @xmath25 .",
    "therefore the symmetry between small and high @xmath25 is broken .",
    "+ temperature @xmath82 : + with increasing temperature spectral weight is shifted from the lower to the upper spin - up band ( compare fig . [",

    "[ fig : pol_d=1 ] the spin polarizations are shown as functions of the applied voltage and the model parameters .",
    "the spin polarization decreases with increasing voltage for all parameters . in the case of one insulating layer only the band center of the right metal is influenced by the voltage , while the band centers of the insulating layer and the left metal remain constant .",
    "the voltage shifts the right band center to lower energies , i.e. the height of the tunnel barrier on the right side increases . with the argument given in the paragraph above this leads to a lower spin polarization .",

    "it grows by a factor of three from about 20 % to almost 60% when decreasing the band center from 5 to 1 ev . + temperature @xmath82 : + the spin polarization closely resembles the behavior of the magnetization , i.e. it has a saturation value for @xmath87 , slowly decreases with increasing @xmath88 and falls off very rapidly near the curie temperature . above @xmath83 it is zero , as expected .",
    "+ band occupation @xmath25 : + the spin polarization is constant for low @xmath25 . for very high @xmath25 and low voltages there is a clear increase since the tunnel barrier is lowered with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "this is good for high polarization as explained above .",
    "+ exchange coupling @xmath49 : + the spin polarization shows the strongest change in dependence on @xmath49 . by increasing the exchange coupling one can reach polarizations of almost 80 % ( although such a high @xmath49 might not be realistic with the chosen band width of 1 ev ) . the increase is approximately linear in @xmath49 .      .",
    "the arrows mark in which direction the scales increase .",
    "parameters : @xmath89    if we replace the one - layer insulator by a two - layer insulator the dependence of the spin polarization on the model parameters remains the same but the dependence on the voltage is reversed .",

    "+ there are several possible reasons for the quantitative difference between theory and experiment .",
    "aluminum is not well described by a single band tight - binding approximation . since the metal qdos has a strong influence on the current characteristics one has to expect differences .",
    "another reason is the treatment of the tunnel barrier .",
    "it was assumed to be rectangular and was rigidly tilted by the applied voltage .",
    "this assumption is , especially for reasons of simplicity , often made .",
    "but on the other hand it is known to be a very crude approximation for real barriers since they can have varying barrier heights and even holes@xcite .",
    "another quantitative difference is the behavior in dependence on temperature .",
    "both in experiment and theory the slope of the curves decreases with increasing temperature , but this decrease is stronger for the experimental curves .",
    "the origin of this difference most likely lies in the treatment of the tunnel coupling .",
    "it was already shown that spin - up and spin - down current approach each other with increasing temperature , but that the spin - up current decreases a little bit faster than the spin - down current increases .",
    "thus the total current decreases , but not enough to explain the experimental results .",
    "this decrease would be larger if the @xmath60 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : depmodpar ] would be steeper .",
    "that might be accomplished by explicitly taking into account the wave - vector dependence of the tunnel coupling which was neglected in this paper .",
    "in this section we replace one of the metals with a superconductor ( m / i / m @xmath100 m / i / s ) . for the derivation of the tunneling current formula we assumed that the leads are non - interacting",
    "obviously , this assumption does not hold in the case treated here .",
    "@xmath4 has to be replaced by the bcs - hamiltonian@xcite : @xmath101 @xmath102 is the bandgap of the superconductor .",

    "here we use an alternative approach , which is known as the effective medium approach .",
    "the basic idea is to split off the interacting part and use it for a renormalization of the one - particle energies and therefore for the density of states : @xmath103 @xmath104 is the superconducting qdos . thus the model hamiltonian remains the same , only the qdos has to be changed in the numerical treatment .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is the restriction to single electron effects , i.e. the neglicence of cooper pair tunneling for example , but the comparison with experiment will justify this .",
    "+ in recent years a lot of research was focused on the transport properties of ferromagnet - superconductor junctions .",
    "especially the role of andreev reflection has been investigated by many authors@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "since andreev reflection involves more than one electron it can not be modeled by our effective medium approach .",
    "again this can be justified by comparison with experiment later in this section .",
    "+ the main difference between normal metals and superconductors is the appearance of the bandgap .",
    "its width is usually of the order of mev .",

    "+ there are several aspects of the model which might be improved .",
    "one is the treatment of the tunnel coupling . especially by the comparison with experiment for the m / i / m system it became clear that the assumption of wave - vector independent tunnel coupling is too much simplified .",
    "it would be very desirable to have a method to derive the tunnel coupling from the other model parameters which are easier accessible by experiments .",

    "( [ form : resjl ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the retarded and lesser green s function in the insulator runs along similar lines as the derivation of the current formula . the first step will be to solve the equation of motion of the corresponding causal green s function . the hamiltonian is again given by eqs .",

    "+ the equation of motion can be brought into the form of a dyson equation by defining a tunnel self - energy as follows @xmath134 with this definition the equation of motion reads @xmath135 the next steps of the calculation are to fourier transform this equation to time dependence , replace integration over the real time axis by integration over the time contour and then to use the analytic continuation rules again to get the lesser and retarded part of the negf . to keep the notation as simple as possible we will use a matrix notation from now on where matrices will be marked by a hat . then the dyson equation for the retarded green s function reads : @xmath136",
    "similarly the lesser green s function solves the keldysh equation :      the free lesser insulator green s function @xmath138 can be expressed by the free retarded green s function with the help of the spectral theorem .",
    "it does nt hold in non - equilibrium , but as was pointed out before , the free green s functions can be calculated in equilibrium .",
