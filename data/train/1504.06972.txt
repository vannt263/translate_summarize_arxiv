    "@xmath13 would correspond to the onset of anisotropic spin correlations , observed with neutrons  [ ] . at low temperature , these correlations turn into short - range spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order  [ ] . the sdw order is known to compete with both superconductivity and cdw order  [ ] , hence it may well be responsible for the fall of both @xmath10 and @xmath6 below @xmath92 ( fig .

    "recent calculations of the in - plane anisotropy of resistivity show how sdw fluctuations can give rise to an upturn in @xmath41 , while cdw modulations would produce a downturn  [ ] .",
    "this could explain the two distinct behaviors seen in the resistivity anisotropy of ybco for @xmath74 and @xmath93 .    in the second scenario , @xmath13 marks the onset of an enhanced nematic susceptibility , with no broken rotational symmetry . in solutions of the hubbard model",
    ", it has been shown that in the presence of a small orthorhombic distortion , of the kind present in ybco , a large in - plane anisotropy of the resistivity appears in the pseudogap phase  [ ] . this could explain the upturns seen in the transport anisotropy of ybco at low @xmath47 and low @xmath25 , and the correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath46 . in these calculations ,",
    "the key organizing principle of the pseudogap phase is the widom line , a line in the @xmath75 phase diagram where electronic properties of the material are predicted to have a distinctive anomaly  [ ] . for example , the charge compressibility peaks at the widom line and both the density of states ( _ e.g. _ the pseudogap measured in specific heat ) and the spin susceptibility ( _ i.e. _ the knight shift measured in nmr ) go through an inflexion point  [ ] .",
    "given that the onset of nematicity in ybco at @xmath13 coincides with the inflexion point in @xmath39 ( at @xmath79 ) , it is tempting to identify the empirical @xmath80 line of fig .  1 with the theoretical widom line of ref .  .",
    "nematicity in ybco is detected as the spontaneous appearance of an in - plane anisotropy in the transport properties upon cooling , in addition to the background anisotropy due to the cuo chains that run along the @xmath19 axis of the orthorhombic structure .",
    "two types of nematicity exist in two different regions of the temperature - doping phase diagram ( fig .  1 ) .",

    "the second type is detected only in the nernst coefficient , and not in the resistivity ( fig .",

    "we discuss two possible scenarios for the first type of nematicity ( @xmath13  line in fig .  1 ) .",

    "<S> nematicity has emerged as a key feature of cuprate superconductors , but its link to other fundamental properties such as superconductivity , charge order and the pseudogap remains unclear . </S>",
    "<S> here we use measurements of transport anisotropy in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2  to distinguish two types of nematicity . </S>",
    "<S> the first is associated with short - range charge - density - wave modulations in a doping region near @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is detected in the nernst coefficient , but not in the resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> the second type prevails at lower doping , where there are spin modulations but no charge modulations . in this case , the onset of in - plane anisotropy @xmath4 detected in both the nernst coefficient and the resistivity @xmath4 follows a line in the temperature - doping phase diagram that tracks the pseudogap energy . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two possible scenarios for the latter nematicity . </S>"
