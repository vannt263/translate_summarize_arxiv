    "as the measurements of the properties of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and their afterglows ( ags ) become more complete and more accurate , new correlations between these properties are being discovered .",
    "such correlations challenge grb models . recently ,",
    "margutti et al .  ( 2013 ) reported results from a comprehensive statistical analysis of the x - ray light - curves of more than 650 grbs ( grbs ) measured with the swift x - ray telescope ( swift / xrt ) between 2004 and the end of 2010 .",
    "in particular , they reported the discovery of new correlations between the properties of the @xmath0-ray and the x - ray emission in grbs . in this paper , we show that the newly discovered correlations by margutti et al .",
    "( 2013 ) between the @xmath0-ray and x - ray properties of grbs agree well with those predicted by the cannonball ( cb ) model of grbs ( dar & de rjula  2004 , dado et al .  2009a , b and references therein ) .",
    "like the previously well established correlations between grb observables , in the cb model they all have the same simple kinematic origin - they result from the strong dependence of the observed radiations on the bulk motion lorentz and doppler ( l&d ) factors of the jet of highly relativistic plasmoids ( cbs ) that produces the radiations by its interaction with the medium through which it propagates ( dar and de rjula  2000,2004 , dado et al .",
    "2007 , dado and dar  2012a ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the cb model dependence of the @xmath0-ray and x - ray properties of grbs on the lorentz and doppler factors to derive the kinematic correlations between them . for completeness",
    ", we shall first summarize the origin of the observed radiations in the cb model and the expected correlations among the properties of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission and among the properties of the x - ray afterglow before proceeding to derive the correlations between them .",
    "in the cannonball ( cb ) model of grbs ( dado et al .  2002 ,",
    "dar and de rjula  2004 , dado et al .  2009a , b ) ,",
    "grbs and their afterglows are produced by the interaction of bipolar jets of highly relativistic plasmoids ( cbs ) ( @xmath1 ) of ordinary matter with the radiation and matter along their trajectory ( shaviv and dar  1995 , dar  1998 ) .",
    "such jetted cbs are presumably ejected in accretion episodes on the newly formed compact stellar object in core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosions ( dar et al .",
    "1992 , dar and plaga  1999 , dar and de rjula  2000 ) , in merger of compact objects in close binary systems ( goodman et al .",
    "1987 , shaviv and dar  1995 ) and in phase transitions in compact stars ( dar  1998 , dar and de rjula  2000 , dado et al .",
    "for instance , in long grbs produced in type ic supernova explosions it is hypothesized that an accretion disk or a torus is produced around the newly formed compact object , either by stellar material originally close to the surface of the imploding core and left behind by the explosion - generating outgoing shock , or by more distant stellar matter falling back after its passage ( dar and de rjula  2000 , 2004 ) . as observed in microquasars , each time part of the accretion disk falls abruptly onto the compact object , two cbs made of ordinary - matter plasma are emitted in opposite directions along the rotation axis from where matter has already fallen back onto the compact object due to lack of rotational support .",
    "the prompt @xmath0-ray pulses and early - time x - ray flares are dominated by inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of glory photons - a light halo surrounding the progenitor star that was formed by stellar light scattered from the pre - supernova ejecta / wind blown from the progenitor star - by the cbs electrons .",
    "the ics is overtaken by synchrotron radiation ( sr ) when the cb enters the pre - supernova wind / ejecta of the progenitor star .",
    "the fast decline of the prompt emission with a fast spectral softening is overtaken ( see , e.g. , dado et al .",
    "2007 , 2009a ) by a broad - band sr afterglow with a much harder spectral index @xmath2 , which stays constant in the x - ray band , when the cb propagates in the wind and interstellar ( ism ) environment .",
    "ics of the sr produces the emission of very high energy photons during the early time optical / nir emission and the broad band afterglow ( dado and dar  2009 ) .",
    "detailed discussion of the origin of correlations between grb properties can be found in dar and de rjula  2000 , 2004 , dado et al .",
    "2007 , and dado and dar  2012a . in short , grbs are not standard candles because of the diversity of their central engines and environments .",
    "but , because of the large bulk motion lorentz factor @xmath0 of the jet of cbs , their emitted radiation at redshift @xmath3 , which is observed at a small angle @xmath4 relative to the direction of the jet , is boosted by a large doppler factor @xmath5 and collimated through relativistic beaming by a factor @xmath6 . in the cb model , the large doppler boosting , relativistic beaming and time aberration dominate the grb properties and produce correlations between grb observables , which depend on them ( dar and de rjula  2000 , 2004 , dado and dar  2012a ) , despite their dependence on the cbs intrinsic properties ( rest frame properties indicated from now on by a prime ) and on the environment along their trajectories ( which produce a significant spread around these simple kinematic correlations ) .",

    "<S> recently , many correlations between the prompt @xmath0-ray emission properties and the x - ray afterglow properties of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been inferred from a comprehensive analysis of the x - ray light curves of more than 650 grbs measured with the swift x - ray telescope ( swift / xrt ) during the years 2004 - 2010 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these correlations are predicted by the cannonball ( cb ) model of grbs . </S>",
    "<S> they result from the dependence of grb observables on the bulk motion lorentz factor and viewing angle of the jet of highly relativistic plasmoids ( cbs ) that produces the observed radiations by interaction with the medium through which it propagates . moreover , despite their different physical origins , long grbs ( lgrbs ) and short hard bursts ( shbs ) in the cb model share similar kinematic correlations , which can be combined into triple correlations satisfied by both lgrbs and shbs .    -0.5 </S>"
