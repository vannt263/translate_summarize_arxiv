    "such behaviour is in agreement with the intuitive pictures , according to which the rate of the joule dissipation decreases with increasing wavelength in the direction of the magnetic field , and , thus , the perturbations become less and less sensitive to the action of the magnetic field as @xmath86 .    typical dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath42 and @xmath40 for the three - dimensional disturbances is shown in figures 2 - 4 . the growth rate changes slowly with the wavenumber and the oblique angle .",

    "we provided detailed analysis of the linear instability of the problem in poiseuille case in direct numerical simulations by resolving the corresponding eigenvalue problem .",
