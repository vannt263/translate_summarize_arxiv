    "<S> charge - tunable semiconductor quantum dots have been an important systems in quantum information science and technology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because they uniquely provide a chip - scale platform of long - lived single spins @xcite with an ultrafast optical interface via the exciton transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , most work has been performed on self - assembled iii - arsenide qds , which are intrinsically limited to cryogenic operating temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the random positioning of these qds also limits their scalability .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , wide - bandgap iii - nitride qds have emerged as an alternative semiconductor system with the potential for higher operating temperatures , better scalability and longer spin relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> single photon emission has been reported at high temperatures @xcite , from site controlled structures @xcite , and with pre - defined polarizations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> exciton rabi oscillation at low temperatures was demonstrated recently with potential applications as an exciton qubit @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the presence of an electron inside the qd prevents additional electrons from entering the qd due to coulomb blockade . </S>",

    "<S> the energy @xmath14 of the singly charged - exciton @xmath15 was lower compared to @xmath16 , suggesting that the attractive coulomb interactions between two electrons and one hole in the qd exceeded the repulsive coulomb interaction between the two electrons . with @xmath17  v , an additional peak @xmath18 appeared at an energy higher than @xmath14 , corresponding to the tunneling of an additional electron into the qd , which introduced strong repulsive coulomb interaction among the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the co - existence of multiple emission peaks at @xmath19 and @xmath20 was due to charges co - tunneling between the gan barrier and the qds @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> due to the tight confinement in a qd , even single charge occupation can change significantly the internal electric field and thus the exciton static dipole moment and the exciton energy , which we can obtain from the voltage dependence of the exciton energy . as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the total electric field @xmath21 in the qd consists of two components : a fixed internal polarization field @xmath22 and a voltage - dependent external field @xmath23 across the p - i - n junction . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 originates from the piezoelectric and spontaneous polarization charges at the ingan / gan interfaces ; it is determined by the composition and structure of the qd and is independent from @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 is due to the separation of the electrons and holes across the p - i - n junction ; it varies linearly with @xmath2 as @xmath24 . from numerical simulations </S>",

[ fig : qd1_vs_qd2](b ) and [ fig : qd1_vs_qd2](e ) with equation  ( [ eq : deltae ] ) , we obtained @xmath35 and @xmath31 for each excitonic state as labeled by the two numbers @xmath36 in the parentheses in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qd1_vs_qd2](c ) and [ fig : qd1_vs_qd2](f ) . @xmath35 were negative , suggesting that the electrons and holes were concentrated at the top and bottom of the ingan / gan interfaces , respectively , consistent with the numerically calculated ground state electron and hole envelope functions ( appendix  [ appedix : simulation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitudes of @xmath35 were around @xmath37  @xmath38 , consistent with the thickness of the ingan layer of @xmath37  @xmath39 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath43 in cgs units , comparable to values reported from other semiconductor qds @xcite .    with the values of @xmath35 and @xmath31 measured above </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained @xmath29 vs. @xmath2 as plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qd1_vs_qd2](c),[fig : qd1_vs_qd2](f ) . at @xmath44 , </S>",
    "<S> accompanying the jump of the exciton emission energies from @xmath12 to @xmath15 , the magnitude @xmath45 dropped suddenly by about @xmath46  e@xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this was also manifested in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the change in @xmath35 suggests that , when an electron tunnels into the qd , it effectively screens the internal electric field of the qd and brings the electron and hole envelope functions of an charged exciton closer to the center of the qd through coulomb interactions .    to further confirm single electron charging of the qd , we measured the energy degeneracies of the exciton states by polarization - resolved pl . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig  [ fig : ax_vs_cax ] , the pl of @xmath12 consisted of two orthogonally polarized peaks with slightly different energies , while no energy difference could be measured between the two polarizations of @xmath47 emission . </S>",
    "<S> these features were measured more accurately by the integrated pl intensity @xmath48 and the shift of the exciton energy @xmath49 vs. the polarization angle @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath16 and @xmath47 exhibited a high degree of linear polarization as shown by the sinusoidal oscillation of @xmath48 vs. @xmath50 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_vs_cax](c ) , [ fig : ax_vs_cax](e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath12 , the same oscillation was also measured for @xmath49 vs. @xmath50 , clearly revealing an energy shift between the two polarizations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_vs_cax](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the data with a sinusoidal function yields the energy shift to be @xmath51  @xmath9ev , in agreeement with previous reported values for confined ingan / gan nanostructures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , no significant energy shift was observed for the charged exciton at different polarization angles ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_vs_cax](f ) ) .    to understand the polarization resolved measurement above </S>",
    "<S> , the energy levels and polarization states of neutral and charged qds are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fss - theory ] . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest optical excitations in iii - nitride qds correspond to the pairing of an s - orbital electron from the conduction band and a p - orbital hole from the a or b valence band , each with a two - fold degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting between the a and b valence bands is mainly due to the spin - orbital interaction @xcite . due to fabrication uncertainties , </S>",
    "<S> the qds have slightly elliptical shapes and thus anisotropic strain distributions . </S>",
    "<S> hence the two - fold degenerate a- and </S>",
    "<S> b- excitons have nearly linear polarizations , parallel and perpendicular to the elongated direction ( x ) of the qd , respectively @xcite . in a neutral qd , the two - fold degeneracy is further lifted by the electron - hole coulomb exchange interactions , resulting in the fine structure splitting ( fss ) of the neutral excitons @xciteas was observed for @xmath16 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_vs_cax](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in a singly negatively charged qd , trions created by optical excitations have two conduction - band electrons forming a singlet with a total spin of zero . as a result , the electron - hole coulomb exchange interaction vanishes and fss becomes absent . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the suppressed energy shift observed for @xmath47 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_vs_cax](f ) .    by changing the qd s charge occupation , we were also able to distinguish the fss from the a- and b - excition splitting . </S>",
    "<S> it has been difficult to distinguish them using neutral qds because , similar to the fine structures , the a- and b - excitons have different intensities and orthogonal nearly - linear polarizations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fss - theory ] and observed in the a- and b - exciton pl spectra ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_vs_bx](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the values of fss and a- and b - exciton splitting could both be about 10  mev @xcite . hence unambiguous identification of fss has been challenging . here , </S>",
    "<S> when we change the qd from neutral to singly - charged , however , the fss became suppressed while the a- and b - exciton splitting remained at about @xmath52  mev ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ax_vs_bx](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence the fss from the a- and b - exciton splitting were clearly separated . finally , we distinguish the fss or the a - b exciton splitting from the exciton - biexciton splitting . </S>",
    "<S> orthogonal polarizations were measured between the fine structures and between the a- and b - excitons , while the same polarizations is expected for exciton and biexciton of the same branch @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : ax_vs_bx](c ) , the integrated intensities of both the @xmath16 and @xmath53 were approximately linearly dependent on the excitation density @xmath54 for @xmath55  w / cm@xmath41 , as expected of excitons and distinct from the @xmath57 dependence expected of bi - excitons .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated quantized charge tuning in site - controlled single ingan / gan qds . </S>",
    "<S> tunneling of an electron into an initially empty qd was controlled by an applied bias voltage and was manifested in discrete changes in the transition energy , static dipole moment and degeneracy of the corresponding excitonic state . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to controllably charge an optically active qd with a single spin will allow the creation of lambda - level system in the qd and thus coherent manipulation of the spin qubit , storage of quantum information in the spin - qubit and further quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> the charge - tuning capability also allowed us to unambiguously identify and measure the fine structure splitting of the neutral exciton , simultaneously with the a- and b - exciton splitting and exciton - trion splitting . </S>",
    "<S> such knowledge of the basic energy structure of the qds provides experimental tests to previous theories regarding exciton charging and fine structures in iii - nitride qds @xcite , and is crucial for spintronics and spin - qubit quantum information processing , such as entanglement generation . </S>"
