    "@xcite-@xcite in which the authors have very carefully investigated the role of higher - order spin interactions in a wide class of real magnetic materials .",
    "as far as it concerns of magnetic properties , the models with multi - spin interactions may exhibit some peculiarities , for example , the non - universal critical behavior @xcite or deviations from the bloch s t@xmath7 law at low temperatures @xcite-@xcite .",
    "here it is worth emphasizing that some of these phenomena are not yet well understood and clarified even at the present time .",
    "in fact , the investigation of many - body interactions is of tremendous importance in all branches of physics , since such studies may discover new physical phenomena that do not appear in the systems with pair interactions only .",
    "however , it is necessary to recall that the investigation of the systems with many - body interactions is as a rule much more complex than those with pair interactions only .",
    "nonetheless , we have recently demonstrated @xcite-@xcite that various versions of the ising model represent a very good theoretical ground for an accurate treatment of multi - spin interactions .",
    "the main aim of this work is to extend our recent research in this field in order to investigate in detail the role of so - called three - site four - spin interactions in crystalline systems with localized magnetic moments . for this purpose",
    ", we will study the mixed - spin 1/2 and 1 ising model with the single - ion anisotropy , pair and three - site four spin interactions on a decorated square lattice .",
    "the outline of the present work is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] and [ gstp ] we derive exact equations for all physical quantities applying a generalized form of decoration - iteration transformation .",
    "the ground - state and finite - temperature phase diagrams are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ nr ] along with thermal variations of other physical quantities .",
    "finally some conclusions are sketched in the last section .",
    "in this work we will investigate the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising model on a decorated square lattice depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively denote the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor bilinear exchange interactions , @xmath11 is the three - site four - spin exchange interaction and @xmath12 represents the single - ion anisotropy parameter .",
    "the summations in the first and second term in ( [ eq1 ] ) run over all relevant pairs on the decorated square lattice , while in the third and fourth term the summations are over all decorating spins , i.e. @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the total number of spin-1/2 atoms .    in order to apply the decoration - iteration transformation to the present model ,",
    "we at first express the total hamiltonian in the form @xmath15 where the hamiltonian @xmath16 includes all interaction terms within the _ k_-th bond of the lattice and it is given by @xmath17 now , using ( [ eq2 ] ) , the partition function of the model can be expressed as @xmath18 where the curled brackets denote the fact that relevant summation concerns all spin variables of the lattice .",
    "introducing the following decoration - iteration transformation @xcite @xmath19 one rewrites equation ( [ eq4 ] ) as follows @xmath20 in the last equation @xmath21 represents the partition function of conventional ising model on a square lattice described by the hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "this partition function has been exactly calculated in a seminal onsager s work @xcite and it will be used in this paper to obtain exact results for thermodynamic properties of the model under investigation . of course , to complete the calculation of @xmath23 we have also to determine the unknown functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . fortunately , this evaluation may be straightforwardly performed by substituting @xmath26 and @xmath27 into eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and in this way one gets @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30",
    "the ground - state phase diagram can be determined investigating the internal energy of the system at @xmath31 .",
    "since we do not consider any external field , the internal energy of the system can be evaluated as a mean value of the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath32 and it takes the following form @xmath33 where the angular brackets denote the standard canonical averaging using the density matrix @xmath34 . for further progress in calculation",
    "it is of crucial importance that all correlation functions entering previous equation can be calculated using the generalized callen - suzuki identities @xcite which in our case take the form @xmath35 } { 2 \\mbox{e}^{\\beta j_4   \\mu_{ki}^z   \\mu_{kj}^z }           \\cosh \\bigl [ \\beta j ( \\mu_{ki}^z + \\mu_{kj}^z ) \\bigr ]   + \\mbox{e}^{-\\beta d } } \\biggr \\rangle,\\ ] ] @xmath36 } { 2 \\mbox{e}^{\\beta j_4   \\mu_{ki}^z   \\mu_{kj}^z }           \\cosh \\bigl [ \\beta j ( \\mu_{ki}^z + \\mu_{kj}^z ) \\bigr ]   + \\mbox{e}^{-\\beta d } } \\biggr \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 represents a function of arbitrary spin variables except of the variable @xmath38 .    now applying the well - known differential operator technique @xcite , we recast previous equation in the more convenient form @xmath39 and @xmath40 where the coefficients @xmath41 are listed in the appendix .",
    "it is clear that after substituting @xmath42 into eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) , we respectively obtain equations for the evaluation of sublattice magnetization @xmath43 and quadrupolar moment @xmath44 . similarly , setting @xmath45",
    "one gets expressions for the correlation functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , that are necessary for evaluation of the internal energy according to ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "finally , it also very important to notice that the magnetization of nodal spins @xmath48 and also the correlation function @xmath49 appearing on the r.h.s of ( [ eq13 ] ) and([eq14 ] ) can be simply evaluated from the relations @xmath50 and @xmath51 where the @xmath52 represents relevant canonical averaging on the original ( non - decorated ) square lattice using the density matrix @xmath53 .",
    "calculation of other thermodynamic quantities is a straightforward process , since in the previous section we have obtained an exact relation for the partition function of the model under investigation ( see eqs ( [ eq6])-([eq9 ] ) ) .    at first , the helmholtz free energy is easily obtained in the form @xmath54 where parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 are given by eq .",

    "( [ eq17 ] ) which is an analytic function in the whole parameter space .",
    "therefore the critical behavior of the model will necessarily belong to the same universality class as that one of the usual 2d ising model .",
    "consequently , the finite - temperature phase boundaries of the system under investigation can be simply determined by substituting the inverse critical temperature of the square lattice @xmath60 into eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , i.e. @xmath61 with @xmath62 .    in this work",
    "we will also study the entropy and specific heat that are respectively given by the relations @xmath63 and @xmath64 here the subscript zero indicates the fact that relevant quantity is calculated in the zero external magnetic field .",
    "numerical results obtained from the above equations are discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "in this section we will discuss the most interesting numerical results for the ground - state and finite - temperature phase diagrams , and thermal dependencies of magnetization , correlation functions , internal energy , entropy and specific heat .",
    "for this purpose it is useful to introduce the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .      in order to investigate the physical nature of possible phases at the ground state",
    ", we have numerically studied the sublattice magnetizations , quadrupolar moment and various correlations functions in our system at @xmath31 . on the basis of these calculations ,",
    "the ground - state phase boundaries have been established from the minimum values of the internal energy of the system .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we have depicted the ground - state phase diagram in the @xmath68 space for the special case of @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath70 . as one can see from the figure , the ordered ferrimagnetic phase becomes stable in the region above the line @xmath71 for negative values of nearest - neighbor pair exchange interaction ( @xmath72 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath73 the ferromagnetic ordering appears in the region above the line @xmath74 .",
    "it also clear that for @xmath75 the ordered ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic phase is respectively stable for arbitrary negative or positive nonzero values of @xmath76 .",
    "space for the mixed - spin ising model without nex - nearest pair interaction ( @xmath69 ) . ]",
    "next , it follows from our analysis that a disordered paramagnetic phase becomes stable in the ground state for arbitrary values of @xmath76 whenever the crystal - field parameter @xmath77 satisfies inequality @xmath78 , i.e. when the single - ion anisotropy takes negative and strong enough values .",
    "consequently , the ordered phases coexist with the paramagnetic one along the line @xmath79 and the system exhibits a first - order phase transition when crossing this line .",
    "now , let us look closely at the particular case of system with pure three - site interaction which is obtained by setting @xmath80",
    ". in this case one finds from eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) that the sublattice magnetization @xmath81 becomes zero for arbitrary values of @xmath77 and of course , the same statement applies also for all correlations including a spin of @xmath82 sublattice .",
    "moreover , one finds from eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) that @xmath83 for @xmath84 , thus the spin states @xmath85 and @xmath86 of all decorating atoms are equally likely occupied at @xmath87 , while the sublattice @xmath24 exhibits the long - range order with @xmath88 . thus the system as a whole exhibits an unexpected behavior with the non - zero ground - state entropy @xmath89 belonging to the partially ordered magnetic phase .",
    "this surprising behavior appears as a result of the interplay between three - site four - spin interaction @xmath11 and crystal - field parameter @xmath12 . on the other hand , for @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    "we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) @xmath92 indicating that all decorating atoms occupy the spin states @xmath93 , so that each atom on the @xmath24 sublattice is surrounded by decorating atoms with @xmath93 . as a result of this spin configuration ,",
    "each atom of the @xmath24 subllatice can be found equally likely in the spin state @xmath94 or @xmath95 thus the entropy at @xmath87 takes now the value @xmath96 . in this case , of course , no magnetic order appears in the ground state .",
    "moreover , one should emphasize here that at the point with co - ordinates @xmath97 and @xmath98 one observes a very interesting partially ordered phase with @xmath99 , @xmath100 , nonzero @xmath101 and unusually high entropy @xmath102 at @xmath87 . as far as we know , such a phase has not been reported in the literature on the ising model until now .    in order to complete the ground - state analysis , let us briefly mention the effect of a positive next - nearest - neighbor interaction , i.e. @xmath103 .",
    "it is clear that in this case the disordered paramagnetic phase never becomes stable for @xmath104 at @xmath31 , so that the system will always exhibit the long - range order with @xmath105 for @xmath106 , and @xmath107 for @xmath108 . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation for @xmath97 , @xmath109 and @xmath103 becomes identical with the above discussed case with @xmath97 , @xmath109 and @xmath69 .",
    "finally , for @xmath97 , @xmath110 and @xmath103 , the system will exhibit a long - range order on the @xmath24 sublattice , despite of the fact that all atoms of the @xmath82 sublattice will occupy the zero - spin states .",
    "however , contrary to the case with @xmath69 , the entropy of the system now always vanishes in the limit of @xmath111 .",
    "now , let us proceed with the discussion of finite - temperature phase diagrams and compensation temperatures .",
    "we recall that the critical temperature is calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) and takes the same value for both ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic cases . in ferrimagnetic systems ,",
    "the compensation temperature is defined as a temperature at which the total magnetization vanishes below the critical temperature , so that in our case it is determined by the condition @xmath112 . in what follows",
    ", we will discuss the most interesting results of phase diagrams and compensation temperatures obtained numerically for some characteristic combinations of freely adjustable parameters .    at first , in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] there are depicted the dependencies of critical temperatures on the reduced single - ion anisotropy parameter @xmath77 for @xmath113 and 1 . as we can see from the figure ,",
    "the phase boundaries for arbitrary @xmath104 do not depend on the sign of the nearest - neighbor interaction , so that both the ferromagnetic @xmath114 and ferrimagnetic @xmath115 phases always vanish at the same critical temperature .",
    "this statement follows , of course , directly form eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) which is invariant under changing the sign of @xmath9 . in agreement with our discussion in previous section",
    ", one finds that magnetization of the system for both ordered phases takes its saturation value at @xmath116 in the region of @xmath117 . of course",
    ", by increasing the temperature , the magnetization will gradually decrease until it continuously vanishes at some critical temperature @xmath118 above which the disordered paramagnetic phase becomes stable .",
    "moreover , as we have already mentioned above , the relevant second - order phase transitions belong to the 2d ising universality class .",
    "next , one also observes from fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] that the region of stability of paramagnetic phase extends from high temperatures down to zero absolute temperature for arbitrary values of parameter @xmath76 , whenever @xmath119 . here",

    "in this case one find that for @xmath109 , the partially ordered phase with @xmath122 and @xmath123 is stable bellow @xmath118 , while above the critical temperature becomes stable again the standard paramagnetic phase .",

    "<S> competitive effects of so - called three - site four - spin interactions , single ion anisotropy and bilinear interactions is studied in the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising model on a decorated square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> exploring the decoration - iteration transformation , we have obtained exact closed - form expressions for the partition function and other thermodynamic quantities of the model . from these relations , we have numerically determined ground - state and finite - temperature phase diagrams of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we have also investigated temperature variations of the correlation functions , internal energy , entropy , specific heat and helmholtz free energy of the system . from the physical point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the most interesting result represents our observation of a partially ordered ferromagnetic or phase in the system with zero bilinear interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable , that due to strong frustrations disordered spins survive in the system even at zero temperature , so that the ground state of the system becomes macroscopically degenerate with non - zero entropy . </S>",
    "<S> introduction of arbitrarily small bilinear interaction completely removes degeneracy and the entropy always goes to zero at the the ground state .    </S>",
