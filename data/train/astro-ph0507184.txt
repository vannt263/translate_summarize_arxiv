    "several cosmological observations , e.g. @xcite , have demonstrated that the expansion of the universe has entered a phase of acceleration . the cosmic acceleration and the questions associated with it constitute one of the most important and challenging problems for several fields of physics ( astrophysics , gravitation , high energy physics , and fundamental physics ) , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a dark energy component that represents 2/3 of the entire energy content of the universe has been proposed to explain cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "this dark energy component can lead to repulsive gravity because of its negative equation of state .",
    "besides dark energy , several models based on modifications to the gravity sector have been proposed recently as alternatives to explain the cosmic acceleration , e.g. @xcite .",
    "these two families of models , dark energy and modified gravity , are fundamentally different , and a question of major importance is to distinguish between the two possibilities using cosmological data . in this paper , we propose a procedure that uses different pairs of cosmological observations in order to address this question .",
    "the procedure is able to find inconsistencies in the dark energy parameter space due to an underlying modified gravity model .",
    "furthermore , a burning question that comes to mind after an equation of state of dark energy has been determined from cosmological observations is as follows : is this really a dark energy equation of state or just a results obtained because one tried to fit a dark energy model on the top of some modified gravity model ?",
    "the procedure proposed also addresses this question .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section two",
    ", we introduce the basic idea of the consistency test .",
    "next , in section three , we recall some of the commonly used parameterizations of dark energy and also an example of modified gravity models . in section four ,",
    "we discuss constraints on the expansion history while in section five we discuss constraints on the growth rate of large scale structure .",
    "section six describes our approach . in section seven",
    ", we describe our implementation of the procedure using cosmological observations and present our results .",
    "we discuss our results and conclude in the last section .",
    "einstein s equations of general relativity relate the curvature of spacetime to the matter and energy content of the universe , thus describing the cosmological dynamics .",
    "cosmic acceleration affects both the expansion history of the universe ( given by the hubble function @xmath0 , where _ a _ is the scale factor and _ z _ is the redshift ) and the rate at which clusters of galaxies grow ( given by the growth rate of large scale structure , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the overdensity ) .",
    "importantly , the expansion function must be consistent with the growth rate function via einstein s equations .",
    "if the cosmic acceleration is not due to a dark energy component in einstein s equations then the presence of significant deviations from the consistency relation between the expansion and the growth rate will be a symptom of a breakdown of general relativity at cosmological scales and a hint to possible modified gravity models at very large scales .    in this paper , the consistency test",
    "is implemented using specific combinations of simulated future cosmological observations .",
    "we assume that dark energy can be described in terms of a cosmic fluid , with an equation of state @xmath3 that can vary with redshift .",
    "we parameterize the variation of @xmath4 using :    * @xmath5 if @xmath6 and @xmath7 otherwise , e.g. @xcite , and also the taylor expansion * @xmath8 , e.g. @xcite .    given @xmath4 , the dark energy density as a function of redshift can be described using the dimensionless function @xmath9 we assume a spatially flat universe and do not include massive neutrinos or isocurvature perturbations . for supernova",
    "( sn ia ) calculations , we use the parameters @xmath10 for weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) calculations , we use : @xmath11 for cmb , we use : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dark energy density fraction , and @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the physical matter density ; @xmath16 is the physical baryon density ; @xmath17 is the optical depth to the surface of last scattering ; @xmath18 is the amplitude of linear fluctuations ; @xmath19 is the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum ; @xmath20 is the characteristic redshift of source galaxies for weak lensing @xcite ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the lensing absolute and relative calibration parameters as defined in @xcite .      in this paper , we are interested in using a good example of modified gravity model but only in order to illustrate the procedure proposed .",
    "we are not interested here in evaluating any particular model of modified gravity .",
    "although several models of modified gravity have been proposed recently as alternatives to dark energy , we chose in this analysis to use the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model .",
    "the model is inspired by higher dimensional physics and is consistent with current observations , e.g. @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , our interest is to use the dgp model as an example of deviation from general relativity in order to test the proposed procedure .",
    "we refere the reader to studied dedicated to the dgp model phenomenology @xcite    we provide in this sub - section a brief introduction to the model , but we refer the reader to @xcite for a full description .",
    "the action for the five - dimensional theory is @xcite @xmath23 where the subscripts @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote quantities on the brane and in the bulk , respectively ; @xmath26 is the five dimensional reduced planck mass ; @xmath27 is the four dimensional effective reduced planck mass ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the ricci scalar and the determinant of the metric , respectively .",
    "the first and second terms on the right hand side describe the bulk and the brane , respectively , while @xmath30 is the action for matter confined to the brane .",
    "the two different prefactors @xmath31 and @xmath32 in front of the bulk and brane actions give rise to a characteristic length , scale @xcite @xmath33 if @xmath26 is much less than @xmath34 , then the brane terms in the action above will dominate over the bulk terms on scales much smaller than @xmath35 , and gravity will appear four dimensional .",
    "for example , nonrelativistic small - scale gravity will obey the newtonian inverse - square force law . on scales larger than @xmath35",
    ", the full five dimensional physics will be recovered , and the gravitational force law will revert to its five dimensional @xmath36 form .",
    "this is usually discussed in terms of gravity leakage into an extra dimension .",
    "@xcite shows that tuning @xmath26 to about @xmath37 , implying @xmath38 , is consistent with cosmological data .",
    "they have also been discussed in @xcite .",
    "low redshift cosmology in dgp brane worlds was studied in @xcite .",
    "defining the effective energy density @xmath39 friedmann s first equation becomes @xmath40 for each perfect fluid @xmath41 on the brane , we may define @xmath42 .",
    "following @xcite , we also define @xmath43 .",
    "we focus here on a flat universe containing only nonrelativistic matter , such as baryons and cold dark matter , in which @xmath44 . in this model ,",
    "the gravitational `` leakage '' into the fifth dimension , on large length scales , becomes a substitute for dark energy .",
    "for a spatially flat universe with dark energy , the hubble parameter @xmath45 can be expressed in terms of its current value @xmath46 and the function @xmath47 as @xmath48 since probes such as the sn ia surveys give information about the redshift variation of @xmath45 but not its current value , we define the dimensionless hubble parameter for dark energy models as @xmath49    for spatially flat dgp model , the expansion is given by @xmath50 to probe the expansion history , we consider calibrated type ia supernovae as standard candles to measure the luminosity distance as a function of the redshift .",
    "recall that the sn ia apparent magnitude as a function of redshift is given by @xmath51 here , @xmath52 depends on @xmath46 as well as the absolute magnitude of type ia supernovae .",
    "we treat @xmath52 as a nuisance parameter .",
    "meanwhile , the dimensionless luminosity distance is @xmath53 as well known , @xmath54 depends on @xmath55 and @xmath56 only through a complicated integral relation , which `` smears out '' dark energy information @xcite .",
    "the result is a degeneracy which allows very different models to have nearly identical @xmath54 .",
    "fig.[fig : hubbles ] shows @xmath54 for a few dark energy and dgp cosmologies .",
    "the figure shows that some dgp models are very degenerate with certain dark energy models , such as @xmath57cdm models or sugra - inspired models .",
    "evident in the expression for @xmath54 is another degeneracy , between @xmath58 and the equation of state parameters .",
    "we break this degeneracy by combining sn ia data with the cmb power spectrum .",
    "we assume the availability of a sample of 2000 supernovae , evenly distributed in redshift between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with a magnitude uncertainty per supernova of @xmath61 . as in @xcite",
    ", we also include a peculiar velocity uncertainty @xmath62km / s , and a systematic uncertainty @xmath63 in bins of @xmath64 .",
    "for dark energy models , the suppression of the growth of large scale structure is due to an increase in the ratio of dark energy density to matter density .",
    "we calculate the growth factor for these models by numerical integration of the differential equation from @xcite , @xmath65\\frac{g'}{a}+\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{1-w(a)}{1+x(a)}\\frac{g}{a^2}=0 ,    \\label{eqn : growthde}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the normalized growth factor , @xmath68 and @xmath69 is as given earlier .    for dgp models , the suppression of the growth is due to weakened gravity resulting from `` leakage '' into the extra dimension .",
    "following @xcite , we use @xmath70 where @xmath71 fig.[fig : growth1 ] shows that , compared to a @xmath57cdm model with the same matter density , a dgp model has a distinct suppression of the growth factor .",
    "also , fig.[fig : growth1 ] displays how the degenerate models of fig.[fig : hubbles ] show distinct growth factor functions . in the next two sections",
    ", we will take advantage of this difference in order to detect possible signatures of dgp models .",
    "we consider weak gravitational lensing ( cosmic shear ) tomography as a probe of the growth factor of large scale structure . indeed",
    ", cosmic shear observations capture the effect of the cosmic acceleration on both the expansion and the growth factor .",
    "we follow the formalism and conventions as used in @xcite and we use the convergence power spectrum as our statistic @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the @xmath74 nonlinear power spectrum of the matter density fluctuation , @xmath75 ; @xmath76 is the scale factor ; and @xmath77 is the comoving angular diameter distance to @xmath78 ( for the spatially flat universe used in this analysis , this reduces to @xmath78 ) .",
    "the weighting function @xmath79 is the source - averaged distance ratio given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the source redshift distribution ( we use the distribution @xcite @xmath82 , which peaks at @xmath83 ) .",
    "we integrate numerically the growth factor function given by eqns .",
    "[ eqn : growthde ] or [ eqn : growthdgp ] above , and we use the linear - to - nonlinear mapping procedure halofit @xcite .",
    "we used the halofit for the dgp models as well because we are only interested into using them as an example of deviation from general relativity in order to test our procedure .",
    "dedicated studies to dgp phenomenology should consider using a better approximation for these models .",
    "as mentioned above , the expansion history is contained in the window function , while the growth factor is contained in the @xmath74 nonlinear matter power spectrum .",
    "fig.[fig : convergences ] shows convergence power spectra corresponding to dark energy models and modified gravity ( dgp ) models .",
    "the separation of source galaxies into tomographic bins improves significantly the constraints on cosmological parameters , and particularly those of dark energy @xcite .",
    "the constraints obtained from different bins are complementary , and add up to reduce the final uncertainties on the parameters . based on recently proposed surveys ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", we use a reference survey with a sky coverage of 10% , a source density @xmath84 , an rms intrinsic ellipticity @xmath85 , and a median redshift @xmath86 .",
    "we assume a reasonable photometric redshift uncertainty of @xmath87 , and we split the sources into 10 tomographic bins over the range @xmath88 with intervals of @xmath89 .",
    "we have used @xmath90 , since the assumption of a gaussian shear field , underlying the fisher formalism and the halofit approximation , may not be valid for larger @xmath91s . for the minimum @xmath91 , we take the fundamental mode approximation , i.e. , we consider only lensing modes for which at least one wavelength can fit inside the survey area .",
    "the cosmic acceleration affects cosmology in two ways : i ) it affects the expansion history of the universe and ii ) it supresses the growth rate of large scale structure in the universe .",
    "the idea that we explore is that , for dark energy models , these two effects must be consistent one with another because they are related by general relativity .",
    "the presence of significant inconsistencies between the expansion history and the growth rate would be the signature of some modified gravity models at cosmological scales .",
    "we propose a procedure that detects such inconsistencies when they are present .",
    "the approach we explore is as follows .",
    "we assume that the true cosmology is described by a dgp model , and then ask what contradictions arise when the data are instead analyzed based on the assumption of a dark energy model ( as mentioned earlier , we are not particularly interested in the dgp cosmology here but we want to use it as an example to illustrate the procedure . )",
    "because we will generate the data using the dgp model , the consistency relation from general relativity between the expansion history and the growth factor of large scale structure will be broken .",
    "the dark energy equation of state @xmath92 which best fits measurements of the expansion will not be consistent with the equation of state @xmath93 which best fits measurements the growth",
    ".    the methods and steps we use are as follows . + _",
    "i ) _ we simulate the data for the expansion and the growth using a fiducial dgp cosmology ( for example , supernova and weak lensing data ) ; + _ ii ) _ we use a @xmath94 minimization method in order to find the best fit dark energy model to measurements of the expansion ( the @xmath94 minimization method was discussed in detail in @xcite and was shown to give similar results to those from monte carlo markov chain method although the @xmath94 minimization can have a better handle on degeneracies @xcite ) ; + _ iii ) _ we use the @xmath94 minimization in order to find the best fit dark energy model to measurements of the growth of structure , + _ iv ) _ next , we use a standard fisher matrix approach to calculate the confidence regions ( or @xmath94 contours ) around the two best fit dark energy models ( this standard procedure is discussed in detail in references @xcite ) ; + _ v ) _ we look for significant differences between the two effective dark energy parameter spaces .",
    "+ these differences will signal an inconsistency between the expansion and the growth factor .",
    "the source of the inconsistency is from point _ (",
    "i ) _ where the data was generated using a dgp model , i.e. from our hypothesis that the true cosmology is that of a modified gravity dgp model .",
    "the basic idea explored here was also discussed in references @xcite but here we propose to implement the idea using pairs of cosmological data sets . in the next section , we will show how a procedure using observations from supernovae , weak lensing tomography , and the cmb allows one to achieve an observational implementation of the consistency test .",
    "note that our approach is totally different from that of @xcite .",
    "their work defined 16 new parameters ( additional to the cosmological parameters ) describing the distance and growth factor as functions of redshift .",
    "a weak lensing survey and cmb power spectra were then used to constrain all 16 parameters simultaneously in order to search for inconsistencies .",
    "+ our work requires no new parameters and we explore inconsistencies between constraints obtained from different pairs of cosmological probes as we illustrate in the next section .",
    "we provide here an implementation of the consistency test using simulated cosmological observations .",
    "this observational test allows one to distinguish between dark energy models and modified gravity dgp models .",
    "we assume the true cosmology to be a dgp model and we analyze two combinations of simulated data sets using dark energy models .",
    "we use the methods and steps indicated in the previous section .",
    "the procedure we use is as follows . + _",
    "i ) _ we use a fiducial dgp model ( with @xmath95 ) and generate supernova magnitudes , weak lensing convergence power spectrum , and cmb power spectrum .",
    "+ _ ii ) _ then , we determine the dark energy model that is the best fit to the supernova magnitudes and to the cmb spectrum generated using the fiducial dgp model . + _ iii ) _ next , we determine the dark energy model that is the best fit to the fiducial weak lensing spectrum and to the cmb spectrum .",
    "+ _ iv ) _ then , we compare the allowed regions in the @xmath96 parameter space between the two data combinations in order to look for inconsistencies .",
    "+    the supernova combination contains information on the effect of the acceleration on the expansion history , while the weak lensing combination contains information on the growth factor in addition to the expansion .",
    "this translates into a difference between the two allowed regions in the dark energy parameter space .    our results in figs .",
    "[ fig : eossnwl_a ] , [ fig : eossnwl_b ] , and [ fig : eossnwl_c ] show that the two allowed regions in the dark energy parameter space are significantly different .",
    "this signals the expected inconsistency between the expansion history and the growth rate of large scale structure .",
    "the source of the inconsistency in figs .",
    "[ fig : eossnwl_a ] , [ fig : eossnwl_b ] , and [ fig : eossnwl_c ] is that we generated the data using a fiducial dgp model but then we used dark energy models to fit the data .",
    "the inconsistency is a consequence of the fact that the fiducial cosmological model is dgp , and therefore it constitutes an observational signature of the underlying modified gravity model .",
    "fig.[fig : eossnwl_c ] shows that the inconsistency between the two equations of state persists even when we consider a third term in the taylor expansion of the equation of state ( section iiia ) .",
    "this indicates that the test is robust to the functional form used for the equation of state .",
    "however , we stress that we did not consider in this study dark energy models with couplings or with an unusual sound speed .",
    "the study of the effect of the sound speed of dark energy on the procedure and also the inclusion of other models of dark energy and modified gravity will be considered in subsequent work .",
    "also , another point worth exploring in future work is the effect of systematic uncertainties .",
    "if such a procedure is performed using real data and an inconsistency is found , then one has to develop methods to test whether the inconsistency is due to physics or to systematics in either of the data sets .",
    "further work will be necessary in order to make this type of test robust and generic .    in summary",
    ", the comparison of measurements of expansion history and measurements of the growth rate of structure tests the behavior of gravity on large scales .",
    "we proposed a procedure that uses different pairs of cosmological data sets in order to explore this comparison and to distinguish between some models of dark energy and modified gravity as the cause of the cosmic acceleration .",
    "being able to distinguish between the two possibilities is an important step in the quest to understand cosmic acceleration .",
