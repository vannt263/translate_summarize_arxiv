    "motivated by very recent experimental results ,  @xcite we employ a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) with _ two _ large josephson junctions to implement the readout .",
    "the generation of the macroscopic entanglement is assisted by applying a microwave field to each charge qubit .",
    "the key advantage of our design is that the squid can also produce an experimentally feasible and controllable coupling between the two charge qubits .",
    "as verified in a single qubit ,  @xcite the coupled charge qubits may be well decoupled from the readout system when the measurement is not implemented .",
