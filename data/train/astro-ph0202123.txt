    "the multi - pupil spectrograph which works at the prime focus of the 6 m telescope for 13 years was born due to close acquaintance of prof .",
    "afanasiev ( during his stay in marseille observatory at the beginning of 1988 ) with the ideas of prof .",
    "the first variant of mpfs ( afanasiev et al . 1990 ) used fibers after the lens array to transmit micropupils to the entrance of a classical ` long - slit ' spectrograph .",
    "the detector was ipcs @xmath0 .",
    "the fibers were quite imperfect , due to them the spectral instrumental profile was ugly .",
    "we started our scientific observations with the multi - pupil fiber spectrograph ( mpfs ) of the 6 m telescope in 1989 .",
    "our initial preference was gas kinematics , but we had obtained a typical velocity error of more than 50 km / s and had understood that kinematical tasks can not be effectively made with that mpfs .",
    "so we looked for another scientific goal .",
    "the same year we published a list of spiral galaxies with kinematically decoupled nuclei that we thought to be unresolved central mass condensations surrounded by circumnuclear gaseous disks ( afanasiev , silchenko , &  zasov 1989 ) .",
    "the idea had arisen to study stellar populations of these decoupled nuclei and to see if they differ from the stellar populations of the surrounding bulges . during the end of 1989 and the first half of 1990 we observed a sample of 10 nearby disk galaxies , including 5 spiral galaxies with kinematically decoupled centers .",
    "we measured radial variations of azimuthally - averaged equivalent widths of the absorption lines mgib@xmath15175 and fei@xmath15270 and had immediately detected chemically distinct nuclei in 6 galaxies from 10 , including 3 galaxies with kinematically decoupled centers .",
    "the drops of ew(mg ) between the unresolved nuclei and their outskirts being calibrated into metallicity terms implied that the nuclei are more metal - rich by almost an order , if the ages of the stellar populations are equal .",
    "these results were published in 1992 ( silchenko , afanasiev , &  vlasyuk 1992 ) . later",
    "the spectrograph was modified more than once : in 1992 the fibers were removed , and mpfs began to work in a classic ` tiger - like ' mode ( bacon et al . 1995 ) , in 1994 the first ccd had come into operation .",
    "in fact , mpfs was three different spectrographs during its whole life : the multi - pupil fiber spectrograph ( 19891992 ) , the multi - pupil field spectrograph ( 19931998 , afanasiev et al .",
    "1996 ) , and again the multi - pupil fiber spectrograph ( 1998now , http://www.sao.ru/@xmath2gafan/devices/mpfs/ ) . the present version of mpfs is equipped with ccd tk @xmath3 ; it allows to expose at once 240 spectra from an area of @xmath4 . besides a target",
    ", it accumulates 16 spectra of the blank sky area on the same frame so sky subtraction is now straightforward .",
    "the main reduction procedures are written by prof .",
    "afanasiev under idl .",
    "the data quality is now sufficient to study 2d distributions of various characteristics . from a single mpfs exposure",
    "we derive : continuum brightness and emission - line intensity maps , stellar line - of - sight velocity field , stellar velocity dispersion field , line - of - sight velocity field of the ionized gas , and the key issue  maps of lick absorption - line indices .",
    "more than fifty early - type disk galaxies are already observed with the mpfs at the 6 m telescope , mainly in the frame of my program of searching for chemically distinct galactic nuclei .",
    "more than two dozens of chemically distinct nuclei are detected .",
    "we have also re - investigated the galaxies whose chemically distinct nuclei were claimed in our first paper ; all of them are confirmed .",
    "figure  1 shows our modern data on magnesium - index radial variations in two galaxies with chemically distinct nuclei , ngc  1023 and ngc  7332 , and in one galaxy without such nucleus , ngc  4550 .",
    "also , the data obtained with the sauron of the wht and taken from the ing archive ( we have reduced them with the software developped in the sao for the second version of the mpfs by vlasyuk 1993 ) and the long - slit data of fisher , franx , &  illingworth ( 1996 ) are plotted for comparison .",
    "one can see the sharp drops of the magnesium - line strength beyond the nuclei in ngc  1023 and ngc  7332 ; the larger field of view provided by the sauron allows to trace more surely the flattening of the mgb profiles in the bulges , especially in ngc  1023 where magnesium gradient in the bulge is absent .",
    "if we compare the nuclear measurements with the bulge data extrapolation toward @xmath5 , we obtain a metallicity difference of 23 times between the nucleus and the bulge under the assumption of equal ages .",
    "so far the existence of the chemically distinct nuclei in nearby regular disk galaxies is now firmly established .",
    "what is a structure  and hence the origin  of chemically distinct nuclei in disk galaxies ?",
    "when bender &  surma ( 1992 ) found a spatially resolved chemically distinct core in the elliptical ngc  4365 , they decided that it is a circumnuclear stellar disk within the giant spheroid  mainly because of its fast rotation . though this hypothesis is not fully confirmed for the other ellipticals with decoupled cores , we feel that something like that is applicable to the chemically distinct nuclei in disk galaxies .",
    "the latters are at the limit of our resolution , with the radii less than @xmath7 , but high - resolution hst photometric data often reveal a presence of distinct circumnuclear disks within the bulges in the same galaxies where we see chemically distinct nuclei . sometimes we can even guess a fine structure of the 2d distributions of stellar population properties .",
    "let us look in detail at two galaxies : ngc  1023 ( silchenko 1999a ) and ngc  7331 ( silchenko 1999b ) . in both galaxies the nuclei demonstrate strong magnesium overabundance , [ mg / fe]@xmath8 .",
    "the mgb - index is peaked in the center and decreases radially quasi - axisymmetrically .",
    "the maximum of the iron indices , though located also around the nuclei , is more extended ( ` flat ' ) and strongly elongated .",
    "isolines of the h@xmath9-index that is an age indicator repeat the shape of the @xmath10 isolines .",
    "we should call these quasi - resolved structures ` fe - rich disks ' .",
    "the stellar populations of the ` fe - rich disks ' have a solar mg / fe ratio and are younger than the nuclear ones by 23  gyr : 5  gyr vs 7  gyr in ngc  1023 and 5  gyr vs 2  gyr in ngc  7331 .",
    "the bulges in both galaxies are old , @xmath11 gyr , and mildly magnesium - overabundant .",
    "to explain this combination of properties , we propose a following scenario .",
    "several gyrs ago a secondary star - formation burst starts over an extended central area of a galaxy . in the very center",
    "it proceeds more effectively ( due to higher gas density ? ) and finishes in less than 1  gyr  to provide a strong magnesium overabundance of the nuclear stellar populations .",
    "but at the edges of the circumnuclear ( initially gaseous ) disks star formation continues over a few billion years resulting in a solar mg / fe ratio and a younger mean stellar age .",
    "since the whole process is rather long , we should be able to catch some future chemically distinct ` cores ' during the non - central star formation .",
    "this scenario explain a phenomenon of blue or even h@xmath12-emission rings in the early - type axisymmetric ( non - barred ) galaxies  we have found such rings in ngc  759 ( vlasyuk &  silchenko 2000 ) and ngc  80 ( silchenko et al . , in press ) .",
    "one of our by - products during the investigation of the stellar populations in early - type disk galaxies was discovery of inner polar gaseous disks in non - interacting regular spiral galaxies .",
    "there is a rare class of peculiar galaxies with large - scale polar rings  the example is ngc  2685 ; these galaxies are supposed to accrete external gas from another galaxy with orthogonal rotational momentum . also some s0 s are known to have decoupled stellar and gaseous rotation axes in their centers ( bertola , buson , &  zeilinger 1992 ; bertola et al .",
    "1995 ) ; an origin of this decoupling is usually related to external gas accretion as well .",
    "meanwhile we have detected inner polar gaseous disks , with radii of a few hundred parsecs , in spiral galaxies possessing global hi - disks with a quite normal rotation  these galaxies are ngc  2841 , 4548 , 6340 , and 7217 . for one of them , ngc  2841 , we have had possibility to check our mpfs results by comparing them to the data of the 2d - fis spectrograph operating at the wht .",
    "figure  2 shows this comparison : the left plots are the mpfs results ( silchenko , vlasyuk , &  burenkov 1997 ) , the right plots are the 2d - fis ones .",
    "one can see that two data sets are consistent : the gas is really rotating directly to the stars ( and in the plane orthogonal to the main symmetry plane of the galaxy , @xmath13 ) , and even the shift of the gas rotation center by some @xmath14 to the north from the photometric center is confirmed . as the more outer gas in all four cases belongs to the main planes and rotates normally in these galaxies , an external origin of the inner gas with the orthogonal momenta seems to be doubtful .",
    "there must exist any intrinsic mechanism to put the gas onto the polar orbit when approaching the center .",
    "sofue &  wakamatsu ( 1994 ) give qualitative arguments that a triaxial potential , or a bar , may easily do so . among our galaxies with inner polar disks ,",
    "only ngc  4548 is a bona - fide barred galaxy , the others are sa .",
    "but when we have studied photometric structure of the galaxies in detail , we have found triaxial bulges in ngc  2841 ( afanasiev & silchenko 1999 ) and ngc  6340 ( silchenko 2000 ) , and an oval inner disk in ngc  7217 ( silchenko &  afanasiev 2000 ) .",
    "so perhaps the phenomenon of the inner polar gas is indeed related to the triaxial potential rather than to hypothetical accretion .",
    "as our sample of s0 s observed reaches now 35 objects , we can try to analyze some preliminary statistics concerning mean metallicities and stellar ages in the nuclei and in the bulges ; here we would take a ` bulge ' as a ring with the inner radius of @xmath7 and the outer radius of @xmath15 so in some cases a circumnuclear disk may contaminate the bulge measurements . to probe an environmental effect , we divide our sample into four parts : cluster galaxies , group central galaxies , peripheric group members , and field galaxies ; in more rough division",
    ", the first two categories can be attributed to the ` dense - environment galaxies ' and the last two  to the ` sparse - environment galaxies ' .",
    "figure  3 presents the diagrams confronting two lick indices , @xmath10 * vs * mgb , for the nuclei and the bulges separately .",
    "one can see a clear environmental effect for the nuclei : all but one galaxies in the group centers and all but one cluster galaxies have [ mg / fe]@xmath16 in their nuclei , whereas the nuclei of the field galaxies are uniformly distributed between [ mg / fe]=0 and [ mg / fe]@xmath17 .",
    "interestingly , for the bulges the environmental effect is much less pronounced , and in average [ mg / fe ] in the bulges of the dense - environment galaxies is smaller than in their nuclei . in general , the bulges of the lenticular galaxies on the diagram ` @xmath10 vs. mgb ' are quite different from the ellipticals of the similar luminosities : they have lower iron indices and probably lower mean metallicities .    to determine mean ( luminosity - weighted ) stellar ages , we confront any metal - line index to the h@xmath9 ; as we try to take into account also various magnesium - to - iron ratios in the stellar populations under consideration , we give two sets of these diagrams , with the models of worthey ( 1994 ) having [ mg / fe]=0 ( fig .  4 , top ) and with models of tantalo , chiosi , &  bressan ( 1998 ) for [ mg / fe]@xmath17 ( fig .  4 , bottom ) .",
    "from these diagrams one can see three rather unexpected things : the nuclei of the lenticular galaxies are obviously younger than their bulges , and some of them are as young as 1.52  gyr old ; though the bulges are in average older than the nuclei , some of them are as young as 5  gyr old ; and the magnesium - overabundant nuclei are not so young as the nuclei with the solar mg / fe ratio .",
    "the last finding can be easily explained by the fact known from chemical evolution modeling : a short ( shorter than @xmath18 yrs ) star formation burst gives magnesium overabundance , and to obtain the solar mg / fe one needs a continous star formation during several gyrs , so in average the solar - mg / fe stellar populations are formed later .",
    "figure  5 gives age distributions for the nuclear and the bulge stellar populations . as some faint emission may contaminate h@xmath9 absorption lines and our age determinations are in fact upper limits , we prefer to give cumulative distributions , namely , a number of galaxies with nuclei ( bulges ) younger than an abscissa age .",
    "again , one can see the environmental effect for the nuclei : the median age for the nuclei of the galaxies in sparse environments is 5  gyr , and the median age for the nuclei of the galaxies in the dense ones is 7  gyr , in accordance with the previous claims that the dense - environment galaxies have higher mg / fe in the nuclei and that the magnesium - overabundant nuclei are in average older . for the bulges , the environmental effect is absent : the bulges of the galaxies in any environments have a median age of 10  gyr .",
