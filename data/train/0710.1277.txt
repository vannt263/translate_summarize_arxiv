    "low - power , fanaroff - riley class i ( fri ) @xcite radio galaxies are numerically the dominant population of radio - loud active galaxies in the universe",
    ". their dynamics and energy content are thus essential to models of agn ` feedback ' in which the energy released in the process of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole is transported to large spatial scales via the interaction between the jets and the external medium . to understand the dynamics and energetics of these sources it is crucial that we should understand the particle acceleration processes by which the bulk kinetic energy of the jets is translated into the internal energy of relativistic plasma .    the discovery with _",
    "chandra _ that x - ray emission is common in the inner few kpc of fri jets @xcite provides a very strong argument that _ in situ _ high - energy particle acceleration is taking place in those regions .",
    "the broad - band spectral energy distribution and x - ray spectrum of the x - ray emission imply a synchrotron origin for the x - rays @xcite . for magnetic fields close to the equipartition value in a typical powerful jet , the loss timescale ( @xmath0 ) for the @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath2 electrons emitting x - ray synchrotron emission is tens of years .",
    "thus observations of x - ray synchrotron emission essentially tell us where particle acceleration is happening _ now _ : in particular , resolved , diffuse x - ray emission implies a particle acceleration mechanism that must be distributed throughout the jet .    to probe the nature of the acceleration mechanisms in fri jets we require observations that can reliably distinguish between compact and diffuse x - ray emission : this implies ( at the most optimistic ) a spatial resolution that is comparable to the loss spatial scale , the distance travelled by an electron before synchrotron losses remove it from the x - ray band , or roughly @xmath3 .",
    "even with the comparatively high angular resolution of _ chandra _ , this can only be achieved in the nearest fri radio galaxy , centaurus a. given cen a s distance of @xmath4 mpc ( the average of 5 distance estimates to cen a : @xcite ) , _ chandra _ s resolution corresponds to @xmath5 pc .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of cen a show a complex , knotty and in places edge - brightened jet structure ( @xcite [ hereafter h03 ] ; @xcite [ k06 ] ; @xcite [ h06 ] ) .",
    "it has been argued ( h03,k06 ) that at least two acceleration mechanisms are required : the dynamics and spectra of the compact knots in the inner part of the jet are consistent with a shock origin , while the diffuse emission is inconsistent both spectrally ( h03 ) and in terms of the number distribution of knots ( k06 ) with being the sum of many unresolved knots with the same properties as those observed , and is instead probably truly diffuse , implying a distributed acceleration mechanism such as second - order fermi acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or magnetic field line reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here we present the results of new , much deeper _ chandra _ observations and their consequences for the nature of particle acceleration in the cen a jet and counterjet .",

    "the relative astrometric alignment of the _ chandra _ data was done in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "we then determined the x - ray centroid of the nucleus by two independent methods ( determining the intersection of the readout streaks and centroiding on the hard wings of the agn psf ) which gave consistent results .",

    "the jet is now detected with high signal to noise out to @xmath11 ( 4.5 kpc in projection ) from the active nucleus , and this allows us to extract spectra for a large number of jet regions ; we discuss the jet spectra in  [ spectra ] .",
    "diffuse emission plausibly related to a counterjet is now detected out to @xmath12 ( 2.0 kpc ) ; we discuss the nature of this emission and its implications in  [ cjet - section ] .",
    "constraints on large - scale variability in jet knots are discussed in  [ variability ] .",
    "to investigate the jet x - ray spectrum we followed k06 in dividing the jet into compact and diffuse regions .",
    "we defined as a knot any compact feature in the jet that is clearly distinguished ( by a factor @xmath13 ) in surface brightness from its surroundings and has radius @xmath14 .",
    "these criteria include many , but not all , of the knots discussed by @xcite and k06 : by our definition there are 26 knots in the jet , all but 4 of which are bright enough for spectral analysis .",
    "we extracted spectra for these knots using the psextract script , fitting a power - law spectrum with a single normalization and photon index and with absorption that was free to vary above the galactic value ( we adopt @xmath15 @xmath16 , as reported by the colden code : @xcite ) , but constrained not to fall below it .",
    "the effects of knot variability on this fitting are discussed in  [ variability ] .",
    "background subtraction was done using local off - source background regions , taking account of the variation in both background surface brightness and column density .",
    "the knot spectra may therefore include a small amount of contamination from diffuse jet background .",
    "the diffuse region of the jet was taken to be a polygonal region including all jet - related emission but excluding all features defined above as knots .",
    "we divided this region into rectangular sub - regions whose long axes were the whole transverse width of the jet ( transverse spectral variations in the jet are discussed by @xcite ) and whose short axes were allowed to grow in a direction parallel to the jet axis , in steps of one _ chandra _ pixel , until sufficient counts were enclosed in all regions for spectroscopic analysis ( @xmath17 counts in the combined dataset before background subtraction ) .",
    "this process gave a total of 53 extended regions .",
    "spectra for these regions were extracted with the specextract script and were fitted with absorbed power - law models in precisely the same manner as the knots .",
    "all the fits for knots and extended regions were acceptable ( probability under the null hypothesis @xmath18% ) .    8.6 cm    the results of this process are summarized in fig",
    ".  [ profile ] , which may be compared with fig .  4 of k06 and table 2 of h03 . based on this profile",
    ", the extended emission of the jet can be divided into three regions with different radio and x - ray properties :     ( i ) ( @xmath19 , except at @xmath20 ) .",
    "x - ray flux dominated by knots ( @xmath21 of total flux in knots : h03 ) : radio surface brightness high : extended @xmath22 flat , often flatter than @xmath23 , and comparable to @xmath22 of knots .     ( ii ) ( @xmath20 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "few x - ray knots ( @xmath25% of flux in knots ) : knots have @xmath22 less than the extended value .",
    "@xmath26 and roughly constant , @xmath27 .",
    "radio surface brightness low , increasing by a factor @xmath28 along the jet .",
    "x - ray surface brightness flat but decreasing by a factor @xmath28 along the jet .",
    "edge - brightening along the jet is present in the x - ray .    ",
    "( iii ) ( @xmath29 ; at and beyond the ` flare point ' of h06 ) . @xmath22",
    "steepens to very high values , @xmath30 .",
    "radio surface brightness increases by factor @xmath31 .",
    "x - ray surface brightness increases by factor @xmath31 , then falls off to zero .    in region ( i ) ,",
    "the flat x - ray spectral index of the extended emission is consistent with the expectations from shock acceleration coupled with rapid downstream expansion losses ( though some of the inner knots have well - determined steep spectra , possibly implying higher magnetic fields in these regions ) , while the fact that @xmath32 is inconsistent with a one - zone model , but is consistent with the idea that much of the particle acceleration here is localized to small sub - regions of the jet .",
    "the new data provide some evidence that structures that appeared diffuse in earlier observations ( e.g. , around knot b ) are in fact composed of smaller sub - clumps . in region ( ii ) , on the other hand , the x - ray and radio / x - ray spectral indices and the general appearance of the jet  dominated not by knots but by filamentary , sometimes edge - brightened features  are consistent with a truly diffuse acceleration mechanism , as argued by k06 .",
    "finally , as discussed by h06 , region ( iii ) corresponds to the end of x - ray emission from the jet .",
    "the remarkable x - ray spectral steepening in this region can not be due to synchrotron losses  the spatial scales involved are too large  but must be due to a progressive loss of efficiency of high - energy particle acceleration .",
    "h06 showed that the mid - ir and radio data are consistent with the idea that there is no particle acceleration beyond the end of the x - ray emission at @xmath33 : the new data provide additional evidence that whatever happens at the ` flare point '  perhaps a significant jet deceleration  makes the diffuse acceleration process substantially less efficient at producing high - energy electrons .",
    "our ability to distinguish between the different models for the distributed particle acceleration process (  [ intro ] ) is limited by the inability of these models to produce detailed predictions for the particle energy spectrum , but the steep spectra seen at the end of the cen a jet represent a challenge for any current model .",
    "h03 showed that a number of x - ray features in the counterjet region had radio counterparts , proving that a coherent counterjet does exist on the kpc scale in cen a , although no large - scale radio emission is detected from it . with the new x - ray data we detect at least 4 more counterjet features ( fig .",
    "[ cjet ] ) .",
    "there is now a weak x - ray counterpart to the compact radio knot sj3 ( using the notation of h03 ) and to the diffuse feature s1 .",
    "the feature denoted sx1 by h03 , with no radio counterpart , turns out to be strongly variable ( see  [ variability ] ) and so may be unrelated to the counterjet . however , the two radio knots s2a and s2b have very clear x - ray counterparts with stable x - ray fluxes . there is also a clear overdensity of fainter compact x - ray features ,",
    "some of which may be counterjet knots , though none has a radio counterpart .",
    "the most striking new counterjet features are the _ extended _ features sx2 and sx3 , the former of which has a curious v - shaped morphology with a radio counterpart to one arm of the v , and the latter of which appears as a patch of diffuse emission on scales of @xmath34 ( 230 pc ) . both of these have clearly harder spectra than the surrounding thermal emission or than other nearby filamentary structures in the lobe region ( fig .",
    "we extracted spectra for these regions from the 2007 datasets only , obtaining a good fit with power - law models with free absorption as for the other spectra , and found @xmath35 and @xmath36 for sx2 and sx3 respectively , consistent with the range of spectra seen for extended regions of the jet discussed in ",
    "[ spectra ] , although we can not rule out thermal models with @xmath37 kev .",
    "sx3 s 1-kev flux density of @xmath38 njy would imply a 5-ghz flux density for a counterpart of @xmath39 mjy , if it were similar to extended regions of the northern jet at comparable nuclear distances , which is hard to rule out given the strong filamentary structure in the s lobe .",
    "( for comparison , 5-ghz flux densities for s1 and s2 are @xmath40 and @xmath41 mjy respectively . )",
    "sx3 s similarity in the x - ray to the diffuse structure of jet features at a similar off - nuclear distance gives us the first evidence that the diffuse acceleration process can also operate in the counterjet .",
    "if this is so , it is unclear why only this one purely diffuse counterjet feature is visible in x - rays .",
    "the fact that the jet - counterjet ratio in the x - ray is in general higher for extended regions than for compact sources lends some support to the model in which x - ray emitting knots are stationary while the diffuse emission comes from the bulk flow .    -5pt    8.7 cm -5pt",
    "a goal of the cen a - vlp was to search for extreme variability in jet knots such as that seen in knot hst-1 of m87 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "only two bright x - ray features related to the jets show very strong variability in the ten epochs available .",
    "the counterjet feature sx1 appears to have flared in the 2003 observations ( h03 ) when its 1-kev flux density is @xmath42 njy compared to @xmath28 njy in all other observations .",
    "its rather flat spectrum ( @xmath43 ) , the fact that it is unresolved and the lack of a radio counterpart means that it may well be a lmxb unrelated to the counterjet .",
    "more interesting is the feature ax2a detected in the 2007 observations in the inner jet ( fig .",
    "[ ijet ] ) .",
    "the 1-kev flux density of this feature is a constant @xmath44 njy in 2007 and @xmath45 njy at all earlier times : it has @xmath46 . as fig .",
    "[ ijet ] shows , it is just at the edge of the radio jet , is compact or unresolved , and has no detected radio counterpart : given its flux density , we might have expected one at the level of a few mjy if it were a jet knot . while continued monitoring of this feature will be interesting it seems most likely that it too is an unrelated lmxb .",
    "there is thus no evidence for extreme variability in any bona fide jet knot in cen a , consistent with the fact that many of the x - ray and radio knots are spatially resolved .",
    "evidence for weaker variability in the x - ray and radio will be discussed in a future paper ( goodger et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the inner part of the cen a jet is dominated by the shock - related knots discussed by h03 , although we have so far failed to see the dramatic variability seen in m87 , interpreted as large changes in particle acceleration processes or in jet flow .",
    "the radio - associated compact features in the counterjet are likely also the result of small - scale shocks , presumably caused as the counterjet flow encounters compact obstacles",
    ". however , the outer 3.4 kpc of the jet  and possibly also the newly detected extended x - ray counterjet components  are different from the shock - dominated regions in their x - ray spectra and structure and in their radio / x - ray ratio .",
    "our results add to the evidence that an unknown , distributed particle acceleration process operates in the jet of cen a. diffuse x - ray emission with a similar broad - band spectrum is seen in the jets of many other fri sources ( e.g. , 3c66b : @xcite ) and it also resembles the extended synchrotron x - ray emission seen in the jets ( e.g. , k06 ) and hotspots ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the more powerful friis .",
    "the cen a data allow us to study the spatial and spectral properties of this emission and the physical processes responsible for it in more detail than is possible in any other object .",
