    "in fermionic systems the competition between phase separation and ( non - phonon mediated ) superconductivity has been a long - standing and active area of research . on the one hand",
    ", cooper pair formation requires an effective attractive interaction , but on the other hand this attraction might ` go overboard ' and lead to the agglomeration of larger clusters of particles . this latter possibility is especially likely in commonly studied models of superconductivity like the hubbard and @xmath2-@xmath3 hamiltonians @xcite which do not include a long - range coulomb interaction that opposes phase separation .",
    "a very similar set of issues arises in the interplay of bose - einstein condensation ( and the closely related phenomenon of superfluidity ) with charge order in bosonic systems , where the possibility of coexistence of diagonal and off - diagonal long range order is termed a ` supersolid ' ( ss ) phase @xcite .",
    "bosonic systems are commonly studied in the continuum@xcite , motivated by liquid @xmath4he . however , as with fermions , issues such as supersolidity can also be addressed within a tight - binding lattice model governed by the boson hubbard hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath5 here @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are boson creation , destruction , and number operators .",
    "@xmath9 is an intersite hopping between sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we consider a square lattice of linear size @xmath12 and total number of sites @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is an on - site repulsion , and @xmath15 is an intersite repulsion .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath16 controls the filling of the lattice .",
    "most studies of the boson - hubbard hamiltonian have considered the case of translationally invariant and short range interactions @xmath17 , @xmath18 for near neighbor ( next near neighbor ) pairs @xmath19 , and near neighbor hopping @xmath20 .",
    "more complex choices for the hamiltonian parameters are increasingly being studied , most notably situations in which the chemical potential models a quadratic trap to confine the bosons @xcite .    in the uniform interaction , hard - core limit , @xmath21",
    ", a site can be either empty or singly occupied .",
    "when a near neighbor , @xmath22 , is turned on at half - filling , the bosons begin to occupy only one of the two sublattices into which the square lattice is divided , owing to its bipartite character . for @xmath22",
    "sufficiently large and at low temperature , this tendency becomes sufficiently pronounced to result in long range order : the boson occupations alternate in a checkerboard pattern , with a charge ordering vector @xmath23 and charge correlations extend to large separation .",
    "doping away from half - filling creates defects in this charge density wave ( cdw ) phase .",
    "if the defect concentration is sufficiently low , it is possible that long range charge order is not destroyed , even though the defects can move through the ordered lattice and form a superfluid . in this way",
    "a supersolid would be realized .",
    "however , it was shown@xcite that this coexistence does not occur for hardcore bosons on the 2d square lattice with near neighbor interactions . rather , there is a thermodynamic instability to phase separation in which different spatial regions are superfluid and charge ordered . despite the absence of simultaneous diagonal and off - diagonal long range order in this most simple scenario ,",
    "other lattice geometries have been shown to exhibit supersolid phases , and , indeed , by now there is a considerable numerical literature as a function of lattice geometry , dimensionality , filling and interaction @xcite .",
    "more exotic processes within the hamiltonian , such as ring exchange , are also known to play a potential role in supersolidity @xcite .",
    "one of the lines of investigation into supersolidity has pursued the effect of anisotropy .",
    "thus , although the checkerboard supersolid with @xmath23 ordering wavevector is unstable , it was also shown that a striped supersolid is stable@xcite .",
    "such a phase is caused by a next - near neighbor interaction @xmath24 which drives charge order at wavevector @xmath25 or @xmath26 which is then doped to allow for mobile defects . in this case",
    "the underlying hamiltonian is isotropic , but a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath27 symmetry associated with order along the @xmath0 or @xmath1 directions occurs .",
    "recent studies have also shown that symmetry breaking in the hamiltonian itself can give rise to striped supersolids .",
    "in particular , chan _",
    "et al._@xcite argued that an attractive interaction in one spatial direction and a repulsive interaction in the other will cause supersolid formation .",
    "these known instances of stability of the striped supersolid , as well as the general delicacy of the energy balance involved in whether phase separation occurs or not@xcite , suggest that a checkerboard supersolid might be stabilized by anisotropic hoppings @xmath28 or interactions @xmath29 in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions .",
    "this is the topic of the present paper .",
    "stable supersolid phases have already been found for soft - core bosons in one , two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "when the contact repulsion , @xmath30 , is large compared to the near neighbor interaction , @xmath22 , ( the mean field value is @xmath31 in two dimensions ) , the system behaves as in the hard core case and phase separates when doped away from half filling .",
    "when @xmath22 dominates , @xmath32 , and the system is doped above half filling , the extra bosons will go on already occupied sites .",
    "these doubly occupied defects then delocalize and yield a supersolid phase . on the other hand ,",
    "if the system is doped below half - filling , it will typically undergo phase separation .",
    "remarkably , however , there is a very narrow parameter range where the system will become supersolid when doped below half filling @xcite .",
    "this history of successful searches for supersolidity in soft - core models prompts us to focus here on the hard - core case .    after introducing our quantum monte carlo methodology and the observables used to characterize the phases , we show results indicating that supersolids do not emerge from a checkerboard charge ordered pattern driven by near - neighbor interactions , even when those interactions or the hoppings are made anisotropic . the dependences of the superfluid density @xmath33 and the cdw structure factor @xmath34 on @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "are calculated .",
    "our computational approach is the stochastic green function ( sgf ) approach@xcite .",
    "sgf is a finite temperature quantum monte carlo algorithm which works in continuous imaginary time ( avoiding the need to extrapolate to zero discretization mesh of the inverse temperature @xmath37 ) .",
    "here we use a recent new formulation of the method which includes global space - time updates@xcite to explore phase space efficiently and to sample the winding and hence superfluid density .",
    "we use a canonical formulation which allows us to work with fixed particle number , although the method can also be implemented in the grand canonical ensemble . note that even within a canonical implementation",
    ", it is still possible to obtain the chemical potential as a finite difference of ground state energies at adjacent particle numbers , @xmath38 .",
    "we will characterize the phases of the hamiltonian eq .  [",
    "ham ] by examining the energy , @xmath39 and also the superfluid density @xmath33 and cdw structure factor @xmath34 .",
    "the superfluid density is obtained using the procedure described by pollock and ceperley@xcite , in which @xmath33 is expressed in terms of the winding @xmath40 of bosonic world lines across a lattice edge .",
    "@xmath41 here we have allowed for the possibilty of inequivalent spatial directions , and measure the @xmath42 and @xmath43 superfluid densities separately .    the cdw structure factor is the fourier transform of the density - density correlation function . @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the number of sites . in order to establish long range order ,",
    "both @xmath33 and @xmath34 must be extrapolated to the @xmath46 limit via finite size scaling .",
    "the choice of how to compare anisotropic lattices with isotropic ones is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "here we have chosen to keep @xmath47 fixed as we vary @xmath48 away from @xmath49 , rather than , for example , fixing @xmath49 and reducing @xmath48 to zero .",
    "our rationale is that this preserves the overall noninteracting bandwidth @xmath50 .",
    "similarly , when we vary the interactions we do so by fixing the sum @xmath51 .",
    "the motivation behind this choice is that in the strong coupling limit the energy cost to add a particle to a perfect checkerboard solid , @xmath52 is preserved .",
    "that is , the  base of the insulating lobes\"@xcite at @xmath53 is the same for all degrees of anisotropy .",
    "we begin by considering @xmath54 but @xmath55 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the checkerboard structure factor @xmath56 and superfluid density @xmath33 as functions of filling @xmath57 . in figure  [ fig1](a )",
    ", @xmath56 is robust to anisotropy , declining only modestly from its value at @xmath58 to its value at @xmath59 .",
    "however , when @xmath60 , @xmath56 is greatly altered . in this limit ,",
    "if the hopping @xmath2 is neglected , the lattice decomposes into independent chains each with density order at @xmath61 but arbitrary @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] indicates that nonzero @xmath63 locks these chains into place spatially ( selecting out @xmath64 as well ) .",
    "this is likely due to the enhanced kinetic energy when hard core bosons in one chain find empty sites on neighboring chains .",
    "this robustness of checkerboard order in the @xmath60 limit is confined to @xmath65 .",
    "the structure factor falls off much more abruptly with doping than when @xmath63 remains nonzero .",
    "the behavior of @xmath33 in figure  [ fig1](b ) is also largely unaffected by anisotropy .",
    "the largest change is an enhancement of @xmath33 in the vicinity of the insulating solid phase at half - filling .",
    "surprisingly , the details of the choice of interaction strength become unimportant at low density ( and high density due to particle - hole symmetry ) .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath43 components of the superfluid response , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , have the same qualitative dependence on density @xmath57 , although for the largest anisotropy @xmath60 , @xmath67 is roughly twice @xmath66 for all densities .",
    "a precise picture of the interplay of the anisotropies in charge correlations and superfluidity is not clear . since @xmath68 it is more likely that @xmath0 neighbors will both be occupied ( or empty ) than @xmath1 neighbors .",
    "strings of adjacent occupied sites of hard - core bosons would seemingly block motion perpendicular to them ( and hence suppress @xmath67 ) .",
    "meanwhile , strings of adjacent empty sites would offer channels for an enhanced @xmath67 . a complicating feature of any attempt to build such a ` blocking / channel ' picture is the fact that while the hard - core nature of the bosons completely precludes certain types of motion , the strong @xmath69 interactions will also profoundly affect the pattern of bosonic flow .",
    "the small non - zero value of @xmath67 at @xmath60 and half - filling is a finite lattice effect .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . )    the detailed evolution of the cdw structure factor and superfluid densities with interaction anisotropy @xmath35 is given in fig .",
    "panel ( a ) emphasizes that @xmath56 is generally robust to anisotropy at half - filling @xmath65 , but can change dramatically for sufficiently small @xmath35 when the system is ( slightly ) doped to @xmath70 .",
    "panel ( b ) indicates similarly that @xmath33 is much more affected by anisotropy in the presence of vacancies .",
    "bosons flow more freely in the direction perpendicular to that for which the repulsive interaction is smaller .",
    "this probably represents the low energy cost of lines of bosons which have strong charge ordering in the @xmath1 direction slipping past each other due to the minimal energy cost in @xmath63 .",
    "of course such a picture is a bit naive in the present case when the system undergoes phase separation and consists of a mixture of superfluid and cdw regions .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a , b ) contained some comparison of data on different lattice sizes .",
    "[ tdenpendence ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] show the effects of temperature @xmath71 and @xmath12 more systematically .",
    "[ tdenpendence ] establishes that the system is in the ground state when @xmath72 , validating the choice of @xmath73 used to access the ground state in fig .",
    "the approach to the low temperature limit is somewhat more gradual in the extreme anisotropic case @xmath60 .",
    "[ fig4 ] allows an extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit @xmath74 . as at half - filling , for a doping",
    "@xmath75 the cdw structure factor @xmath56 is nonzero at large @xmath12 .",
    "further doping to @xmath76 destroys long range density order .",
    "the anisotropic system is more sensitive to doping than when @xmath77 .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] ,  [ tdenpendence ] , [ fig4 ] establish the possibility of a supersolid phase : non - zero @xmath33 coexists with large @xmath56 in the vicinity of half - filling .",
    "however , it is necessary to distinguish a true supersolid phase , in which these orders coexist as a single stable thermodynamic phase , from a lattice in which both orders are present at separate spatial locations .",
    "this phase separation is most easily detected by looking for an anomalous negative curvature , @xmath78 , in the thermodynamics .",
    "figure  [ compare - eanisov ] shows that such negative curvature is present just below @xmath65 , unless @xmath60 .",
    "the jump in slope @xmath79 at @xmath65 is the charge gap @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the density @xmath57 as a function of chemical potential @xmath16 .",
    "the kink at half - filling in fig .",
    "[ compare - eanisov ] is reflected in a plateau in the density . as commented earlier",
    ", fixing @xmath81 makes the length of this plateau @xmath82 the same for all degrees of anisotropy in the strong coupling ( @xmath83 ) limit .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] indicates that finite hopping @xmath84 reduces @xmath80 from the @xmath53 value @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "there is only a relatively small reduction in @xmath80 going from @xmath87 to @xmath59 .",
    "setting @xmath60 , however , reduces the gap to @xmath88 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the signature of phase separation is made more evident , in the form of a double valued dependence of density on chemical potential @xmath89 .",
    "in other words , the chemical potential @xmath16 is not a monotonically increasing function of density @xmath57 .",
    "the usual maxwell construction can be used to ascertain the relative sizes of the superfluid and solid regions in this situation .",
    "the instability of the checkerboard supersolid in the isotropic case is known@xcite .",
    "figures  [ compare - eanisov ] and [ fig6 ] establish that this instability persists in the anisotropic case , except in the extreme case of vanishing interchain interaction , @xmath60 . however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the structure factor falls off rapidly with doping in this situation , so that long range density ( solid ) order is no longer present .",
    "thus the absence of phase separation does not imply the existence of a supersolid .",
    "figure [ ekepetxty1vx1vy5v2 ] shows the individual components of the energy . at @xmath65",
    "the system is in an insulating checkerboard solid phase , and has a corresponding minimum in the absolute value of the kinetic energy .",
    "the potential energy at first increases from the low density limit , reflecting the increased likelihood of adjacently occupied sites . at @xmath90 , however , the potential energy decreases , despite a rising number of particles .",
    "presumably this reflects the onset of density order : a coherent pattern of occupation in which adjacent sites are rarely occupied .",
    "evidently , the decrease of @xmath91 for near neighbor sites @xmath92 associated with solid formation overwhelms the ` trivial ' increase @xmath93 expected for noninteracting bosons .",
    "having explored the possibility of supersolids caused by anisotropy in the near neighbor interaction we turn to the analogous question when @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the checkerboard structure factor @xmath56 and superfluid densities @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions .",
    "the structure factor is peaked at half - filling but remains relatively large in some interval surrounding that density .",
    "in general @xmath94 , the superflow in the @xmath0 direction shows a dip at fillings @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this dip becomes more pronounced as the hopping anisotropy increases .",
    "we will address this issue , which requires some challenging qmc simulations and which is not directly related to the questions being addressed here@xcite , in a later paper .",
    "the thermodynamics , shown in @xmath97 ( fig .  [ fig9 ] ) and @xmath98 ( fig .  [ fig10 ] ) show some features similar to those seen in the anisotropic interaction case .",
    "@xmath97 exhibits a kink at @xmath65 indicating a jump in the chemical potential and hence a charge gap , and also negative curvature near @xmath65 suggesting phase separation .",
    "@xmath98 demonstrates these features even more directly .",
    "the gap ( plateau in @xmath98 ) is unchanged even for a case when the ratio of hoppings is altered by a factor of three from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "this is in contrast to interaction anisotropy to which the gap is more sensitive ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] provides quantitative detail on the evolution of the cdw structure factor and superfluid densities with hopping anisotropy . for both densities ,",
    "the data for @xmath56 are quite flat over the range shown , @xmath101 .",
    "the superfluid densities , especially in the @xmath0 direction show significant quantitative evolution@xcite , but qualitatively they are unchanged , indicating superfluid behavior for density @xmath70 and insulating behavior for half - filling @xmath102 .",
    "the simultaneous presence of diagonal and off - diagonal long range order , as opposed to a transition between distinct ordered phases , is by now well - established in many bosonic models . in this paper",
    "we have shown that this coexistence is thermodynamically unstable in a broad range of square lattice hard - core hamiltonians with near neighbor interactions and hopping parameters which break @xmath42-@xmath43 symmetry .",
    "although our results are for choices in which only hopping or interactions are anisotropic , we have also studied a few cases where x / y symmetry is broken in both terms @xcite .",
    "these more complex situations also exhibited phase separation as opposed to supersolidity .",
    "of course , we can not exclude the possibility that a supersolid is stable in some other choice of parameter values .",
    "the motivation for studying such situations is to gain a more complete understanding of the interplay between real space particle arrangements and superflow in quantum systems . for strongly correlated fermions ,",
    "this is a central puzzle of unconventional superconductivity : do antiferromagnetic ( af ) and charge order ( stripes ) compete or coexist with pairing ?",
    "these issues arise not only in cuprate materials , which have af ordering at @xmath103 but also in the more recently discovered iron - pnictides whose magnetic ordering is at @xmath104 : af in one direction and ferromagnetic in the other .",
    "since bosonic systems are more simple to study computationally than fermionic ones , it would be interesting to extend the present work to ` spin-1/2 ' bosons@xcite where one might have the analogs of both spin and charge order along with the possibility of superfluidity .",
