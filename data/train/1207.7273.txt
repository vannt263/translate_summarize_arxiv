    "cosmology research has entered a new era since the discovery of the acceleration of the universe ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; riess et al . 1998 ) .",
    " dark energy \" ( de ) , which has negative pressure and accounts for 73% of the total energy density of the universe , is currently the best candidate to explain the cosmic acceleration , and understanding its nature has become one of the most important problems in modern astronomy and physics .",
    "there are several promising methods to explore dark energy with high accuracy via its equation - of - state parameter @xmath7 ( frieman , turner & huterer 2008 ) . as pointed out by hu ( 2005 ) , among all observables for probing de in light of the microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , @xmath7 is most sensitive to variations in @xmath8 .",
    "hu ( 2005 ) concluded that the single most important complement to the cmb for measuring @xmath7 at @xmath9@xmath100.5 is a determination of the hubble constant ( at @xmath9@xmath100 ) to better than a few percent .",
    "this insight forms the fundamental motivation for the megamaser cosmology project ( mcp ; reid et al .",
    "2009 ( paper i ) ; braatz et al .",
    "2010 ( paper ii ) ; kuo et al .",
    "2011 ( paper iii ) ; and reid et al .",
    "2012 ( paper iv ) ) , which aims to determine @xmath8 to 3% accuracy .",
    "the key to a precise and direct determination of the hubble constant is to measure accurate distances to galaxies well into the hubble flow ( i.e. @xmath11 30 mpc ) .",
    "the galaxies must be distant to reduce the contribution of the uncertainty coming from peculiar velocities relative to a smooth hubble flow .",
    "among all the approaches to measure accurate distances directly , the megamaser method pioneered by the study of ngc 4258 ( herrnstein et al .",
    "1999 ) has proven to yield accurate and direct distance measurements to galaxies beyond our local group .",
    "the methodology of the megamaser technique for distance determination can be found in paper i , paper ii , and the modified version of the techinique that directly measure the hubble constant can be found paper iv .",
    "the application of the megamaser technique for measuring black hole mass can be found in paper iii .    in the mcp",
    ", we aim to measure the hubble constant with @xmath1010% or better accuracy from each of about 10 galaxies , thereby determining @xmath8 to @xmath103% after averaging the results .",
    "the first galaxy measured by the mcp was ugc 3789 ( paper i , paper ii & paper iv ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis using a simple model of the maser disk in paper ii gave a hubble constant of 69@xmath211 mpc ( 16% accuracy ) , and the overall uncertainty of the hubble constant has recently been further reduced to @xmath1010% when new data and better modeling were included ( paper iv ) .",
    "in this paper , we present the direct hubble constant measurement from ngc 6264 , the first galaxy beyond 100 mpc measured with the megamaser method . in section 2 , we present our vlbi and single - dish observations . in section 3",
    ", we show the analysis of the centripetal accelerations of the masers in ngc 6264 .",
    "the hubble constant and distance determinations are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the challenges of applying the maser technique to distant galaxies .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in section 6 .",
    "we observed ngc 6264 with four tracks of vlbi observations between 2009 and 2010 using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , augmented by the 100-m robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) and the 100-m effelsberg telescope .",
    "two of the four tracks ( bb261f and bb261h ) were presented in kuo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and in this paper we present the observations bb261k and bb261q .",
    "our final vlbi image includes the data from all four tracks .",
    "the observing parameters for these four vlbi tracks are shown in table 1 .",

    ", we achieved a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) by averaging multiple maser lines in narrow ranges of both velocity and spatial position to perform phase calibration .",
    "note that while the multiple maser lines used in the self - calibration are slightly offset on the sky , the position differences among the spots in a single if band are usually only @xmath101/10 of the typical synthesized beam of the observation . in this case , we simply averaged the maser signals to enhance the snr . based on simulations , the phase shifts caused by such small position differences",
    "do not lead to noticeable systematic error in the self - calibration .    in bb261k and bb261q ,",
    "the maser lines were generally weaker than those in the previous observations on ngc 6264 , and averaging multiple maser lines in a single if band was not adequate to achieve sufficient snr for self - calibration .",
    "one way to overcome this difficulty is to utilize all maser lines with flux densities above @xmath1020 mjy in _ all _ if bands for self - calibration . since the positional differences of maser spots in different if bands can be comparable to the synthesized beam , we first removed the phase shifts due to different maser locations by dividing the data by complex visibilities calculated from a model of the maser spot distribution .",
    "the model division effectively moves all maser spots in consideration to the phase center of the observation , and since these masers now have approximately the same phase , averaging the maser lines in the calibration process will increase the snr directly .    in order to choose the model of maser locations ,",
    "the best approach is to use maser positions made by calibrating phase with a background quasar ( i.e. phase - referencing observations ) .",
    "if available , observations from another epoch when the masers were stronger and self - calibration was successful can also be used . following this guideline , for bb261k and bb261q",
    ", we used the map from bb261f and bb261h as our model before performing self - calibration .",
    "once the phase shift removal and line averaging are done , we treat the masers as a single maser spot , and follow the same calibration procedure for solving the atmospheric phase , solution editing , and imaging as described in kuo et al . 2011 . finally , we combine the maser map obtained from bb261k and bb261q with the one from bb261f and bb261h on the image plane by aligning the maser disks using the average positions of the systemic maser features with velocities between 10191.1 km  s@xmath3 and 10198.3 km  s@xmath3 as the reference",

    "water masers in circumnuclear disks experience centripetal acceleration as they orbit the central black hole .",
    "we measure these accelerations by tracking the line - of - sight velocity of each maser line in the spectra obtained by the gbt as they change with time .",
    "these acceleration measurements are used along with the positions and velocities of maser spots obtained from the vlbi maps to construct the maser disk model for distance determination described in section 4 .    in this paper",
    ", we adopted two different methods to determine the accelerations of maser spots , one method for high velocity masers600 km  s@xmath3 . ] and the other for systemic masers . ] .",
    "we call the first method the _ eye - tracking _ method . in this method ,",
    "we first measure the peak velocities of maser spectra at different epochs , and plot the spectral peak velocities as a function of time ( e.g. in fig .",
    "1 ) . we then identify a group of data points within a particular time segment by eye that we believe to be from a single maser line , and fit the trend of the data with straight lines .",
    "the slopes of the fitted lines directly give the accelerations .",
    "we apply this method to high velocity masers .",
    "the second method is based on a global least - square fitting program ( braatz et al .",
    "2010 ; humphreys et al . 2008 ) that we call _ glofit_. here we fit multiple maser lines from multiple epochs simultaneously , and determine the accelerations of the fitted maser lines in a single step .",
    "this is the same method we used for measuring accelerations for ugc 3789 ( paper ii ) and described in detail as  method-1 \" in paper iv .",
    "we apply this method to systemic masers .    among these two methods ,",
    "we choose the glofit technique for the systemic masers because the glofit method can better handle the line - blending effect of the systemic masers , and determine their accelerations more accurately . on the other hand , since many high velocity maser lines are relatively isolated , and very precise acceleration measurements of these masers are not critical for accurate distance determination , we apply the quicker eye - tracking method to provide estimates of accelerations for the high velocity masers .    when using the glofit program to measure the accelerations of the systemic masers , it was necessary to use a different strategy for ngc 6264 than for ugc 3789 , because the effects of strong blending and low snr made finding stable and converging solutions more difficult .",
    "we mitigated these effects by grouping the masers lines into groups of lines ( clumps ) , in each of which all the maser lines were fitted with a single acceleration parameter . in principle , this approach should help the program to reach convergence more efficiently and stably , because fewer parameters are needed when we enforce a common acceleration .",
    "we have found that this is indeed the case by testing this approach with synthetic spectra generated from simulations .",
    "finally , the applicability of the glofit program , as described above , depends critically on the assumption that masers within the selected velocity range drift at the same rate . therefore , to avoid systematic errors it is important to examine whether the chosen sections of spectra really satisfy this assumption .",
    "the constant acceleration assumption can be checked in several ways , including whether the eye - tracking method gives nearly the same accelerations for maser lines within the chosen spectral region , the persistence of the maser spectral pattern with time , and the reduced @xmath14 of the fit .",
    "we refer interested readers to kuo 2012 ( ph.d .",
    "thesis ) for details .      in figure 1 , we plot the radial velocities of ngc 6264 maser peaks measured by eye as a function of time . for the blueshifted and redshifted masers , we first identify lines that are persistent in time and then fit a straight line to the data to measure the acceleration directly with the eye - tracking method .",

    "* we modeled the h@xmath0o maser disk in ngc 6264 with a bayesian approach and obtained a hubble constant of @xmath1 68 @xmath29 km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 , corresponding to an angular - diameter distance of 144@xmath219 mpc .",
    "the hubble constant is consistent with the value obtained from ugc 3789 in paper iv ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "this is the first time the megamaser technique has been successfully applied to a galaxy beyond 100 mpc .",
    "we expect that including new observations will enable a 10% accurate estimate of the hubble constant from ngc 6264 , as well as constraining the magnitude of orbital eccentricity in the maser disk .",
    "and @xmath28 and the possible cause .",
    "the left panel shows the fitting results for galaxy distance @xmath40 and bh mass @xmath28 from our initial version of the bayesian fitting program plotted on the @xmath56 diagram .",
    "the nearly straight - line appearance shows that @xmath40 and @xmath28 are highly correlated , and the correlation coefficient is nearly unity .",
    "the plot shown in the middle panel provides an explanation for this correlation .",
    "the black curves represent the quadratic relation between @xmath40 and @xmath28 from equation ( a2 ) and the dashed straight lines show the linear relation for @xmath40 and @xmath28 from equation ( a3 ) for a given set of measurements of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . for a given distance , the black curves ( from top to bottom )",
    "give the @xmath28 measured with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , plus its 1 @xmath60 , 0 @xmath60 and -1 @xmath60 uncertainty .",
    "likewise , the dashed lines ( from top to bottom ) give the measured @xmath28 based on equation ( a3 ) plus its 1 @xmath60 , 0 @xmath60 , and -1 @xmath60 uncertainty .",
    "every intersection of a dashed line and a black curve ( the black spots ) represents a solution for @xmath40 and @xmath28 from fitting the maser disk . as described in the appendix , we conclude that it is because the uncertainty in @xmath58 is usually significantly smaller than @xmath57 and @xmath59 that all solutions fall nearly on a straight line on the @xmath56 diagram .",
    "the presentation in the right panel is similar to that of the middle panel , with the only difference that @xmath40 in equation ( a2 ) and ( a3 ) is replaced by @xmath61 , and we plot the hubble constant on the x - axis .",
    "it can be seen that the solutions no longer fall on a straight line , and @xmath8 and @xmath28 are not perfectly correlated . ]    in our bayesian modeling of maser disks in the mcp , we fit @xmath8 directly , rather than fitting @xmath40 as in herrnstein et al .",
    "there are four reasons that make @xmath8 preferable over @xmath40 in the disk modeling : ( 1 ) since @xmath8 is the primary parameter we intend to measure , it is more convenient to save an extra step of calculation and have the posteriori probability distribution of @xmath8 directly output from the modeling program ; ( 2 ) in this way the effect of uncertainty in peculiar velocity of a galaxy can be directly incorporated in the @xmath8 calculation ; ( 3 ) since @xmath62 1/@xmath57 and @xmath57 usually has the largest fractional uncertainty among our observables , the posteriori probability distribution function of @xmath40 would usually be asymmetric ; finally , ( 4 ) if we use d as a fitting parameter , its posteriori probability distribution is usually more highly correlated with @xmath28 than @xmath8 ( see figure 8a ) .",
    "superficially , a high correlation between d and m suggests that these parameters might be nearly degenerate .",
    "this issue was not addressed in earlier work on ngc 4245 ( herrnstein et al 1999 ) .",
    "we found that replacing @xmath40 with @xmath8 in bayesian modeling partially resolves this issue .",
    "nonetheless , the high correlation between d and m deserves further investigation in order to understand its nature and whether the results from the work on ngc 4258 and other sources that fit the maser disks with d and m are limited in accuracy .",
    "we shall show that this behavior is a general characteristic of methods that rely on different powers of combinations of parameters and useful results can be obtained even when a formal correlation coefficient approaches unity . in the following analysis , we use a `` simple '' maser disk with systemic masers lying in a single narrow ring to demonstrate the case .    in the problem of modeling the maser disk and determining the angular - diameter distance ,",
    "the relationship between @xmath40 and @xmath28 arises from two different measurements : the centripetal acceleration of the systemic masers and the keplerian rotation curve for the high velocity masers . in the former case",
    ", we can see the relation between @xmath40 and @xmath28 in the equation for the centripetal acceleration @xmath57 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the gravitational constant , @xmath24 is the physical radius of the orbit of the systemic masers , and @xmath65 is the apparent angular radius of the systemic masers . in principle , @xmath65 can be obtained from the intersection points between the straight line traced by systemic masers ( v @xmath16 @xmath66 ) and the keplerian rotation curve traced by the high velocity masers ( v @xmath16 k  @xmath67 ) in the position - velocity diagram of the maser disk ( see braatz et al .",
    "2010 ) . by solving for @xmath65 with the rotation curves for the systemic and high - velocity masers ,",
    "we obtain @xmath68 . with this , we can re - write equation ( a1 ) and express @xmath28 as a quadratic function of @xmath40 : @xmath69      in figure 8b , we plot equation ( a2 ) with black quadratic curves and equation ( a3 ) with dashed lines for a given set of measurements of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 including their uncertainties .",
    "every intersection of a dashed line and a black curve ( black dots in figure 8b ) represents a solution for @xmath40 and @xmath28 from fitting the maser disk , and all possible solutions ( within 1 @xmath60 uncertainty ) only fall in a region on the @xmath56 diagram whose shape is defined by the relative sizes of the uncertainties in @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . in current megamaser galaxies being observed for distance determination , the uncertainty in @xmath58 is usually small ( @xmath101% ) while the errors in @xmath57 and @xmath59 are more significant ( e.g. @xmath7310% ) . as a result , the dashed lines span a very narrow region on the @xmath56 diagram while the black curves cover a much broader region , and all the possible solutions for @xmath40 and @xmath28 fall on a region whose shape resembles a line .",
    "this makes @xmath40 and @xmath28 appear to be nearly 100% correlated .",
    "therefore , the apparent high correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath28 is not a result of intrinsic degeneracy , and thus the fitting results should be reliable .    in figure 8c",
    ", we demonstrate how the correlation between fitting parameters is reduced by replacing @xmath40 with @xmath74/@xmath8 in equations ( a2 ) & ( a3 ) .",
    "now , one can see that the possible solutions no longer fall exactly on a straight line , and actually follow the @xmath28 @xmath75 1/@xmath8 relationship .",
    "because of this , the nearly perfect correlation does nt exist between @xmath28 and @xmath8 .",
    "nonetheless , one can imagine that if the uncertainties in @xmath57 and @xmath59 are also small , then the black curves may cover a much smaller region , and the possible solutions may only fall in a small segment of the 1/@xmath8 curve .",
    "the distribution would thus resemble a straight line , and high parameter correlation appears again .",
    "this is indeed seen in our data , but because of the analysis shown here , high correlation should no longer be a serious concern .",
