    "the dynamical triangulation model of four dimensional euclidean quantum gravity has recently been the subject of interest @xcite .",
    "the canonical partition function of the model at some fixed volume ( number of four - simplices ) @xmath1 may be defined as a sum over triangulations @xmath2 of the hypersphere @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of simplices of dimension @xmath6 in the triangulation @xmath2 with fixed edge lengths .",
    "the @xmath5 @xmath7 satisfy three constraints which means that only two of them are independent .",
    "we have chosen @xmath8 and @xmath9 as the independent variables .",
    "for comparison with other work we remark that if @xmath10 is chosen instead of @xmath8 then the corresponding coupling constant @xmath11 is related to our @xmath0 as @xmath12 .",
    "the weight @xmath13 is part of the regge - einstein action @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the volume of 2-simplices ( triangles @xmath16 ) in units of @xmath17 .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that the system at fixed volume can be in two phases . for @xmath18 ( weak bare coupling @xmath19 )",
    "the system is in an elongated phase with high @xmath20 while for @xmath21 ( strong coupling ) it is in a crumpled phase with low @xmath20 .",
    "the elongated phase has a low effective dimensionality and a large average distance while the crumpled phase has a high effective dimensionality and a small average distance between the simplices .",
    "the transition at @xmath22 is found to be continuous with a susceptibility @xmath23 that grows with @xmath1 .",
    "this opens the exciting possibility that continuum behavior may be found at the phase boundary @xcite .",
    "recently , evidence was presented @xcite that the partition function @xmath24 grows faster than exponentially in @xmath9 at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "this result was interpreted as to cast doubt on the dynamical triangulation approach to four dimensional gravity , because it implies that the grand canonical partition function @xmath25 is ill defined ( the parameter @xmath26 is related to the bare cosmological constant ) .",
    "we like to argue however that it is useful to study the local and ultraviolet properties of the model separately from the global and cosmological properties .",
    "the nonexistence of @xmath27 need not invalidate the possibility of a scaling regime at large @xmath9 . in this letter",
    "we report on our results for the behavior of @xmath24 and shall argue that a possible continuum limit involves sending also @xmath0 to infinity , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "unfortunately , no set of local moves to simulate the canonical ensemble is known and probably no such set exists @xcite . therefore , we rewrite the partition function ( [ partv ] ) as @xmath29 where the sum is now over all triangulations @xmath2 with @xmath3 topology . in a simulation",
    "we can then generate configurations with boltzmann weight @xmath30 and select only those configurations with @xmath31 .",
    "the precise form of @xmath32 is unimportant .",
    "we have taken followed @xcite and used @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "this is smaller than the value used in @xcite , resulting in somewhat larger volume fluctuations .",
    "as the number of triangulations can not grow faster than @xmath35 such a term ensures that the volume does not blow up in the simulation .",
    "the interesting question is now how @xmath36 behaves as a function of the volume and the coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "the simulation of the system @xmath37 allows the measurement of @xmath38 through the equation @xmath39 which follows from a saddle point approximation for @xmath40 in this ensemble . at the same time this simulation gives us configurations with the weights ( [ weights ] ) to measure properties of ( [ partfunc ] ) .",
    "we will not expand here upon our method to generate simplicial complexes , but for definiteness let us mention that we allow all those complexes where no two @xmath41-dimensional ( sub)simplices share exactly the same set of @xmath42 points .",
    "( in @xcite our criteria were somewhat different , our present criteria lead to numerical results in agreement with @xcite . )",
    "=    figure  [ andiv ] shows the value of @xmath43 as a function of the volume at @xmath44 , where the configurations at any particular volume all have the same weight .",
    "the points at the highest volumes are somewhat correlated as the autocorrelation time became of the order of the time between volume increments .",
    "the line is a fit to @xmath45 where the fitting parameters are @xmath46 with @xmath47 we have also tried fitting the data to the converging functions @xmath48 for various small @xmath49 and @xmath50 the function ( [ sumpowfit ] ) simply does not yield any reasonable fit . on the other hand ,",
    "the small converging power ( [ smallpowfit ] ) fits with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which is consistent with zero .",
    "this also points to a logarithm .",
    "the large error in @xmath53 is due to its large correlation with the power @xmath54 . for",
    "fixed @xmath54 the error in @xmath53 would be much smaller .",
    "both the qualitative picture and the value of @xmath55 ( [ fitb ] ) agree with data reported in @xcite , produced via completely independent code .",
    "the forms ( [ logfit ] ) and ( [ smallpowfit ] ) are virtually indistinguishable for small powers .",
    "thus , if it is indeed a logarithm , a converging small power can never be excluded and will even be favored if the low volume points have somewhat lower @xmath43 than that of a pure logarithm .    at the other side of the transition , at @xmath56 , the same plot ( not shown )",
    "is just a horizontal line for all volumes we have used , which went up to 90,000 .",
    "the fitting parameters for the logarithmic function ( [ logfit ] ) are in this case @xmath57 with @xmath58 , which is consistent with a constant ( i.e.  @xmath55 is consistent with 0 ) .",
    "so in this phase the number of configurations making an important contribution to the partition function does rise only exponentially with the volume .",
    "=    the values of @xmath43 at various volumes and @xmath0 values in the region of the transition can be seen in figure  [ k4ck2 ] .",
    "we have subtracted @xmath59 from the data for @xmath43 to expand the vertical scale .",
    "the diamonds indicate the value of @xmath22 at each volume . for the lowest three volumes these are the points obtained in @xcite , while those of 8000 and 16000 are our own .    going from right to left the curves",
    "are close together and then break away from each other as their slope decreases .",
    "the break away point moves to the right as the the volume increases . assuming that it is correct to extrapolate the pattern in this figure and eqs .",
    "( [ fitb],[fitb2 ] ) to large volumes , we conclude that @xmath43 first stays constant as the volume increases and then , depending on the value of @xmath0 , starts to diverge logarithmically .",
    "we also see that the transition between the crumpled and elongated phase moves to larger @xmath0 as the volume increases , staying near the break away points .",
    "there is a close relation between these curves and the average curvature , due to the relation @xmath60 this implies that the largest change in the slope of these curves will coincide with the susceptibility peak and that as that peak becomes narrower the bend in the @xmath61 curve becomes sharper .",
    "these results indicate that the number of crumpled configurations grows factorially with the volume , while the number of elongated configurations only grows exponentially .",
    "this would mean that at any fixed @xmath0 the crumpled configurations will always dominate for large enough volumes .    from this",
    "it already follows that the @xmath22 of the transition between the phases must diverge with the volume . in ref .",
    "@xcite a converging scenario is favored but a diverging one not excluded . in fact , it is mentioned @xcite that leaving out data points with @xmath62 leads to fit with @xmath22 diverging logarithmically with volume . the large @xmath0 region in fig .",
    "2 seems indeed to suggest that @xmath63 is somewhat too low to see the asymptotic trend .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the bare free energy @xmath64 is extensive at the phase boundary , @xmath65 . from ( [ re ] )",
    "we see that this would be the case if @xmath66 is independent of @xmath1 for large @xmath1 . assuming a logarithmic dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath1 the last two terms are constant so",
    "the question is whether the difference of the first two is @xmath1 independent .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "2 that this unlikely : in the range @xmath67 , @xmath68 which rises faster with than @xmath69 .    expecting extensivity with the bare einstein - regge action is questionable .",
    "it consists of two very different terms @xmath70 and @xmath71 which will require different renormalization , such that the particular linear combination @xmath72 has to be modified . in other words , the curvature term will mix with the volume @xmath9 under renormalization .",
    "a natural candidate is @xmath73 , where the @xmath74 may be fixed by some normalization condition .",
    "we are therefore not disturbed by the fact that the average bare curvature is rather different from zero at the transition @xcite .",
    "one may also contemplate obtaining a physical curvature in terms of a physically defined metric , but there are other perhaps more easily accessible quantities .",
    "elsewhere @xcite we have proposed a way of measuring the renormalized newton constant @xmath75 in terms of the binding energy of test particles .",
    "it is however not even clear to us that @xmath1 should be interpreted as the physical volume as measured in terms of a physical metric at physical scales , because @xmath1 is sensitive to the proliferation of baby universes @xcite .",
    "we have presented results suggesting that the bare gravitational coupling @xmath19 has to go to zero in a possible scaling limit .",
    "it is interesting that also in matrix models of 2d gravity with unrestricted topology the number of configurations rises factorially with the volume and a sensible continuum limit can only be taken by letting the bare @xmath19 go to zero in the so called double scaling limit @xcite .",
    "perhaps 2d gravity in its dynamical triangulation formulation ( without restriction on topology ) has also a strong coupling phase .",
    "similarly , the scenario with @xmath19 going to zero might also be applicable to the case of four - dimensional simplicial gravity with unrestricted topology . in this model",
    "it is certain that there is no exponential bound on the number of configurations .",
    "just as we finished this paper we received a preprint @xcite presenting data that favors the scenario with @xmath43 converging according to ( [ smallpowfit ] ) with an exponent @xmath54 of @xmath76 ."
