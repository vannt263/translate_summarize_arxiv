    "since the discovery of the optical flash of grb 990123 @xcite , great attention has been paid to the very early optical afterglow ( e.g. , for theory see @xcite ; for observation , see @xcite ) of soft , long grbs .",
    "the very early optical afterglow of short grbs and x - ray flashes have also been investigated in some detail @xcite .    in nearly all these theoretical papers ,",
    "the fireballs are assumed to be non - magnetized and neutron - free .",
    "however , in principle , the ejecta may be significantly magnetized ( see @xcite and the references therein ) or contain a large amout of neutrons ( e.g. @xcite ) , or both ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently we have studied the early afterglow emission ( especially the reverse shock emission ) of a magnetized ejecta and a neutron - rich ejecta @xcite . here",
    "we summarize the main results . comparing these results with the early afterglow observations",
    ", we may get insight into the initial composition of the outflow and reveal the nature of the central engine .",
    "a bright optical flash was detected during the bright grb 990123 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the peak v - band flux was 8.9th magnitude .",
    "after the peak , the flux drops as @xmath0 ( before the peak , the flux increases as @xmath1 ) .",
    "such a sharp decrease has been modeled by the emission from the shocked electrons contained in the reverse shock region with adiabatic cooling @xcite . with a more careful investigation , fan et al . found that by taking the reverse shock model and the physical parameters found in modeling the multi - wavelength afterglow from the forward shock emission , the theoretical peak flux of the optical flash accounts for only @xmath2 of the observed value ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . in order to remove this discrepancy",
    ", they suggested that the electron and magnetic equipartition parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , should be 0.61 and 0.39 , respectively .",
    "these are much different from the corresponding values for the late afterglow ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .    in a more general discussion ,",
    "zhang , kobayashi & mszros introduced a parameter @xmath8 ( which is defined as @xmath9 ; where the superscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the reverse shock region and forward shock region , respectively ) to trace the magnetization of the grb outflows @xcite .",
    "they found @xmath1215 for grb 990123 and @xmath13 for grb 021211 .",
    "these results have been also confirmed in several more detailed analysis of both bursts @xcite . as a result , it is quite robust to say that the reverse shock region is magnetized , at least for grb 990123 and grb 021211 . in the following ,",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath14 , the ratio between the electromagnetic energy flux and the particle energy flux , to describe the initial magnetization of the outflow ( we assume that the magnetic field is ordered ) .",
    "as the outflow interacts with the surrounding medium , two shocks form .",
    "one is the forward shock expanding into the medium , and the other is the reverse shock penetrating into the outflow .",
    "the forward shock jump condition is the same as that of a pure hydrodynamical fireball model @xcite , but the reverse shock jump condition is different ( see equations ( 2 - 5 ) of @xcite for the general form ) .",
    "the novel features include : * 1*. at the reverse shock front , for @xmath15 , the amplified ordered magnetic field ( @xmath16 ) is significantly stronger than that of the random one ( @xmath17 ) . in the ism medium ,",
    "the typical synchrotron radiation @xmath18 is much lower than @xmath19hz and the reverse shock - accelerated electrons are in the slow cooling regime .",
    "the observed flux scales as @xmath20 therefore , the r - band reverse shock emission is stronger for a higher @xmath16 ( see fig.[fig_lsigma_ism ] ) , which matches the observation of grb 990123 and grb 021211 .",
    "however , for @xmath21 , the reverse shock is suppressed ( in both @xcite and @xcite , the ideal mhd approximation is taken .",
    "if magntic dissipation @xcite is taken into account , the result would be different ) , so that the reverse shock peak level starts to decrease ( see fig.[fig_lsigma_ism ] ) . in the wind medium case ,",
    "the r - band reverse shock emission with magnetization is weaker ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_lsigma_wind ] ) since the reverse shock is relativistic and the electrons are in the fast cooling phase , and @xmath22 is above @xmath23 .",
    "the observed flux scales as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cooling frequency . as a result , @xmath26 decreaes with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "* 2*. in the very early afterglow phase , the outflow is ultrarelativistic . due to the beaming effect ,",
    "the area we view is very narrow where the orientation of magnetic field is nearly the same .",
    "the local high linear polarization can not be averaged effectively . as a result , net high linear polarization is expected . by introducing a parameter @xmath27 ,",
    "the net linear polarization can be approximated by ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath28 even for @xmath29 , the linear polarization as high as @xmath30 is expected .    )",
    "light curve powered by the mildly magnetized outflow ( the degrees of the magnetization have been marked in the figure ) interacting with the interstellar medium .",
    "the parameters taken in the calculation are : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the radiation efficiency @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total initial energy of the outflow , @xmath40 is the luminosity of the @xmath41ray emission , @xmath42 is the initial bulk lorentz factor of the outflow , @xmath43 is the power - law distribution index of the shock - accelerated electrons , and @xmath44 is the number density of the medium . for @xmath45 and the forward shock , it is assumed that @xmath46 .  from ref  @xcite . ,",

    "i.e. , the mildly magnetized regime , their results are rather similar to that of @xcite . for @xmath48 ,",
    "i.e. , the high-@xmath14 regime , it is found out that the reverse shock peak is broadened , mainly due to the separation of the shock crossing radius and the deceleration radius of the outflow ( see fig.[fig_hsigma_ism ] ) .",
    "this novel feature can be regarded as a signature of high @xmath14 .    .",

    "lightcurves are calculated for different @xmath14 values . from ref  @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]    another important result obtained is that the suppression factor of the reverse shock in the strong magnetic field regime is only mild as long as the shock is relativistic , and it saturates in the high-@xmath14 regime ( see fig.[fig_hsigma_supp ] ) .",
    "this indicates that strong relativistic shocks still exist in the high-@xmath14 limit , which can effectively convert kinetic energy into heat .",
    "the overall efficiency of converting jet energy into heat , however , decreases with increasing @xmath14 , mainly because the fraction of the kinetic energy in the total energy decreases @xcite .",
    "these results have been confirmed by fan , wei & zhang both analytically and numerically @xcite , see their equations ( 17 - 18 ) and figures 1 and 2 .    , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , as a function of @xmath14 .",

    "the ion - ejecta ( i - ejecta ) has been decelerated , but the neutrons are not .",
    "they move freely into the medium and decay into protons , neutrinos and electrons .",
    "these dacay products share their energy and momentum with the medium and form a mixture ( the trail ) moving with a bulk lorentz factor about tens , the actual velocity mainly depends on the density of the medium .",
    "comparing with that of the pure fireball or the magnetized fireball , the early afterglow of neutron - fed grbs is very complicated .",

    "the averaged @xmath41ray luminosity is taken as @xmath96 .",
    "other paramters and line styles are the same as those in ( b ) . from ref  @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]    if the medium is a pre - stellar wind , the neutron trail moves slowly , mainly because the medium inertia is too large .",
    "the trail and the i - ejecta do not separate from each other , and a forward shock propagates into the trail directly .",
    "three components contribute to the final emission , i.e. the forward shock , the reverse shock propagates into the i - ejecta , and the unshocked trail emission .",
    "the latter is significant when @xmath97 , the ratio of neutrons to protons , is large , since the internal energy of the unshocked trail is large when the medium density is high .",
    "a typical neutron - rich wind - interaction lightcurve is a characterized by a prominent early plateau lasting for @xmath98 s followed by a normal power - law decay ( fig.[fig_neutron_wind ] ) .",
    "we also show that in the wind case , the ic cooling effect due to the overlaping of the initial prompt @xmath41ray with the shocks and the trail suppresses the very early r - band afterglow significantly . the neutron - fed signature is also dimmed ( see fig.[fig_neutron_wind](b ) and fig.[fig_neutron_wind](c ) for a comparison ) .     respectively .",
    "( b ) r - band lightcurves .",
    "line styles are the same as in ( a ) .",

    "are plotted .",
    "the initial parameters are the same as those listed in the caption of figure [ fig_neutron_wind ] , except that @xmath36 is adopted . from ref  @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]    if the medium is a constant density ism , part of the neutron decay products fall onto the medium , and the trail moves faster than the i - ejecta ( in @xcite , it is assumed that the i - ejecta moves slower than the fast neutrons ) .",
    "a gap likely forms between the leading trail and the i - ejecta .",
    "the former forms a distinct trail ejecta ( t - ejecta ) which interacts with the out trail or ism .",
    "the latter catches up later and gives rise to a rebrigtening signature . before collision ,",
    "the radiation is dominated by the forward shock emission . during the collision , both the forward shock emission and the refreshed shocks ( especially the refreshed reverse shock )",
    "are important .",
    "the unshocked trail emission is not important in this case .",
    "a typical neutron - rich ism - interaction lightcurve is characterized by a slow initial rising lightcurve followed by a prominent bump signature around tens to hundreds of seconds ( fig.[fig_neutron_ism ] ) .",
    "for all the cases , the predicted signatures can be detected by the uvot on board the _ swift _ observatory",
    ". however , most of these signatures ( such as the plateau and the bump signature ) are not exclusively for neutron decay .",
    "more detailed modeling and case study are needed to verify the existence of the neutron component .",
    "most of the current afterglow observations take place hours after the burst trigger . at this stage ,",
    "the observed afterglow emission are powered by the forward shock , so that essentially all the initial information of the ejecta is lost . in order to diagnose the ejecta composition ,",
    "well - monitored early afterglow data are needed , since the early afterglow emission , especially in the optical band , is believed to be dominated by the reverse shock emission and possibly the trail emission .",
    "the reverse shock propagates into the ejecta , so the emission property , especially the linear polarization degree , depends on the magnetization of the ejecta .",
    "the neutron signature emission lasts only tens to hundreds of seconds , which overlaps with the very early shocks emission .",
    "only rapid responce to the trigger can catch it .    in this proceedings paper , we have summarized the early afterglow signatures of magnetized grbs and neutron - rich grbs .",
    "these signatures are likely detectable by the ultraviolet optical telecope ( uvot ) on board the _ swift _ observatory .",
    "close monitoring of early afterglows from 10s to 1000s of seconds , when combined with detailed theoretical modeling , could be used to diagnose their existence , which may in turn help us to reveal the nature of the grb central engine source .    currently , there are just two well studied cases .",
    "i.e. grb 990123 , and grb 021211 , whose early afterglow lightcurves are well consistent with reverse shock emission from a moderately - magnetized flow @xcite",
    ". however , the magnetization itself does not mean the outflow is initially magnetized since in the internal shock phase , random magnetic fields are generated , significant part of which can not be dissipated effectively .",
    "these magnetic fields could be retained in the external shock phase to dominate the reverse shock synchrotron emission . in this case",
    ", there is no net polarization expected .",
    "consequently , the early polarization detection is necessary to draw definitive conclusions on the initial magnetization of the ejecta .",
