    "the computation of scattering amplitudes has proven a remarkably rewarding theoretical problem , exposing previously unknown symmetries and structures of well - studied field theories .",
    "spectacular examples of this can be found in the maximally supersymmetric @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory ( sym )  @xcite , where structures such as dual conformal symmetry  @xcite , twistor string theory  @xcite and grassmannians  @xcite have emerged out of the study of on - shell amplitudes .",
    "a structure of particular relevance to nonplanar gauge theory and to gravity , is the duality between kinematic and color constituents of amplitudes , uncovered at tree - level  @xcite and conjectured to extend to all loop orders  @xcite by bern and the current authors .",
    "the duality has the property of interlocking the various kinematic diagrams of generic gauge theories into a very rigid system , effectively minimizing the independent information needed to specify an amplitude . at tree level , this has been used to construct an @xmath4 basis for color - ordered @xmath5-point amplitudes  @xcite , which has since been proven in both string and field theory  @xcite . at the mulitloop level , it has been used to specify the complete ( planar and nonplanar ) integrands for special four - point amplitudes using one or more `` master graphs ''  @xcite .",
    "a second property of the duality is the remarkably simple structure imposed on gravity amplitudes .",
    "once gauge theory amplitudes are arranged such that the kinematic factors are on equal footing with color factors , then gravity amplitudes are obtained through simple double copies of the gauge theory kinematic factors  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was given a detailed proof valid for tree - level amplitudes , in the case of @xmath1 supergravity  @xcite as a double copy of @xmath0 sym , and in the case where einstein gravity amplitudes are acquired through double copies of pure yang - mills amplitudes .",
    "at tree level the double - copy structure is closely related to the kawai - lewellen - tye relations  @xcite between closed and open string amplitudes . beyond potentially clarifying the inner structure of gravity",
    ", the double - copy property offers a way to circumvent the usually cumbersome computations of integrands of loop - level gravity scattering amplitudes .",
    "the duality between kinematics and color is conjectured to be valid for generic yang - mills and gravity theories in any dimension and to any loop order and multiplicity . at tree level",
    ", strong supporting evidence exists  @xcite ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite for various applications . as for loop level",
    ", four - point calculations in the @xmath0 sym and @xmath1 supergravity theories have shown that duality - satisfying amplitude representations can be found through four loops  @xcite , and also for the two - loop four - point identical - helicity amplitude in qcd  @xcite .",
    "the natural implication of the observed duality is that the kinematic structures of both gauge theories and gravity theories are elements of some hereto possibly unknown lie algebras . in a recent paper by bern and dennen  @xcite this",
    "was assumed in making the first steps towards a trace representation of the algebra .",
    "even more recently monteiro and oconnell  @xcite identified a certain infinite - dimensional area - preserving diffeomorphism algebra in the self - dual sector of yang - mills theory as being responsible for the duality , at least for the case of maximally - helicity - violating ( mhv ) tree amplitudes in four dimensions . for non - mhv amplitudes , or higher - dimensional amplitudes",
    "the algebra is not yet known .",
    "a step in this direction was taken in  @xcite , where the first terms in a cubic yang - mills lagrangian that obeyed the duality were worked out . knowing the full form of such a lagrangian would be equivalent to knowing the structure constants of the kinematic algebra , at least at the level of tree amplitudes .    in this paper",
    "we strengthen the evidence supporting the duality by explicitly computing several duality - satisfying five - point amplitudes in @xmath0  sym and , consequently , in @xmath1  supergravity .",
    "first we work out a representation of the four - dimensional duality - satisfying one - loop five - point amplitude in detail .",
    "this amplitude will turn out to have an interesting and compact structure that encodes the external state dependence . based on this structure the pattern for higher - loop five - point amplitudes will become clear , resulting in a proposed ansatz for the duality - satisfying amplitude to arbitrarily loop order at five points .",
    "this ansatz is parametrized by rational coefficients , which require further explicit calculations in order to be determined .",
    "we confirm the ansatz through three loops by computing the amplitudes at each loop order .",
    "the one- and two - loop results are included in this paper , and the three - loop results will be given in an accompanying paper  @xcite .    the planar five - point @xmath0 sym amplitudes have previously been computed through three loops  @xcite . beyond one loop ,",
    "nonplanar amplitudes have not been worked out ( other than for particular four - point amplitudes  @xcite ) , so the results presented here are novel .",
    "the four - dimensional one - loop five - point amplitude of @xmath1 supergravity is previously known  @xcite .",
    "however , the form of the amplitude presented here is more general as it is valid for all values of the dimension of the internal momenta , or dimensional regularization parameter , @xmath2 ( in @xcite the closely related all - plus - helicity amplitude was given for general @xmath2 ) .",
    "similarly , the two - loop five - point @xmath1 supergravity amplitude is a new result .",
    "all amplitudes presented in this paper will be valid for general internal @xmath2 , and the gauge theory amplitudes will be given for general gauge theory group @xmath6 .",
    "the study of potential ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences and counterterms of @xmath1 supergravity is an area of active research , see _ e.g. _",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that this theory may be finite to all loop orders , contrary to common expectations .",
    "spectacular ultraviolet cancellations were subsequently observed in direct calculations of the three- and four - loop four - point amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "recently , counterterm analysis and other methods have ruled out divergences through at least six loops in four dimensions  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we supplement these results with the more modest five - point one- and two - loop ultraviolet studies .",
    "we explicitly integrate the newly obtained amplitudes in the lowest ( critical ) dimensions where they develop a ultraviolet divergence , namely @xmath7 at one loop , and @xmath8 at two loops , for both @xmath0 sym and @xmath1 supergravity .",
    "we find that the general form of the divergences of the two theories and two amplitudes agree with the observed divergences of the corresponding four - point amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "thus , in doing so , we verify the expected uv behavior of these theories  @xcite at five points through two loops .    for the construction of the amplitudes we implicitly make use of the unitarity method  @xcite and generalized unitarity  @xcite , which we will not discuss in any detail .",

    "similarly , in we construct the duality - satisfying two - loop amplitudes , and compute their corresponding ultraviolet divergences .",
    "finally , in we present our conclusions .",
    "the conjectured duality between color and kinematic factors  @xcite relies upon a representation of gauge theory amplitudes using graphs with only cubic vertices , see _",
    "e.g. _ reviews  @xcite . for five - point amplitudes in the adjoint representation",
    "we have _ 5^(l)= i^l g^3 + 2l_i_3 . [ loopbcjform ] where @xmath9 is the usual integral measure of @xmath10 independent @xmath2-dimensional loop momenta @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the set of all cubic @xmath10-loop five - leg graphs , counting all relabeling of external legs .",
    "corresponding to each internal line ( edge ) of the @xmath13 graph we associate a propagator @xmath14 , which is a function of the independent internal and external momenta , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the local numerator functions , here only schematically indicated as @xmath17 , include information about the kinematics and states .",
    "the color factors @xmath18 contain the information of the gauge - group structure , and are given by multiplication of the structure constants @xmath19 t^c)\\,$ ] , with hermitian generators @xmath20 normalized via @xmath21 .",
    "the symmetry factors @xmath22 are the same as those obtained in , say , scalar @xmath23 theory .",
    "the duality between color and kinematics is satisfied in amplitude representations ( [ loopbcjform ] ) where the kinematic numerators @xmath17 obey the same general algebraic relations as the color factors @xmath18 .",
    "specifically , the @xmath17 obey jacobi relations and have antisymmetric behavior analogous to the color factors , schematically ,   n_i+n_j+n_k=0   & &   c_i+c_j+c_k=0 ,  ( jacobi  identity ) +  n_i - n_i   & &  c_i -c_i   [ definingjacobi ] where the first line signifies the jacobi identity valid for specific triplets of graphs in the amplitude , and the second line represents the action of flipping the ordering of a cubic vertex in a graph . as we will see in the following sections , at loop level it is most convenient to treat these kinematical relations as functional equations over the internal momentum space .",
    "in addition , it can be useful to impose the self - symmetries or graph automorphisms on the @xmath17 , similar to the self - symmetries obeyed by the color factors",
    "@xmath18  this effectively reduces the number of independent @xmath17 functions .    once the gauge theory numerators satisfy the duality we can construct gravity numerators by taking two copies of gauge theory kinematic numerators  @xcite . given a five - point @xmath10-loop gauge theory amplitude with duality - satisfying numerators @xmath17",
    ", the corresponding gravity amplitude takes the form _",
    "5^(l)= i^l+1 ( ) ^3 + 2l_i_3 , [ gravbcj ] where @xmath24 is the gravitational coupling constant , and",
    "@xmath25 are a set of kinematic numerators for the amplitude of a possibly different gauge theory ( which need not explicitly satisfy the duality  @xcite ) .",
    "to construct @xmath1 supergravity amplitudes , we are interested in the case where both numerators belong to the @xmath0 sym theory ; hence , the two numerators are effectively identical . however , for precise bookkeeping of the individual states we should distinguish the @xmath26-symmetry indices of the two numerators .",
    "the @xmath1 supergravity theory has @xmath26-symmetry group @xmath27 , and the double - copy form ( [ gravbcj ] ) makes part of this manifest , namely the subgroup @xmath28 .",
    "a convenient way to embed this into @xmath27 is to shift the @xmath26-symmetry indices of the second numerator copy @xmath29 by a uniform offset of 4 .      the procedure for finding a duality - satisfying representation for an amplitude involves several steps .",
    "our approach is as follows : one starts by identifying all distinct cubic graphs with @xmath10 loops and @xmath30 external legs , and writes down the linear equation system generated by the kinematic jacobi relations and graph self - symmetries . reducing this linear system by simple elimination of numerators eventually results in a system where very few graph numerators remain .",
    "these are the so - called `` master graph '' numerators , as they effectively encode the full amplitude .",
    "the kinematic jacobi relations generates functional equations when applied to loop - diagram numerators , as the relations typically compares the numerators at different points in the internal momentum space .",
    "the functional equations are in general nontrivially entangled , but when reasonable assumptions on the form of the functions can be made such systems are readily solved . specifically , if locality is assumed , then the numerators are simple polynomials of a degree fixed by the engineering dimension of the numerator .",
    "assigning each master graph a local ansatz built out of external and internal momenta , polarizations and spinors , should be sufficient for the task .",
    "however , using formal polarization vectors usually results in overly complicated expressions that obscure the otherwise compact analytic form of the amplitude ( although notable exceptions exists  @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , such representations can impede making manifest the kinematic simplifications that occur when the external states and momenta are restricted to a fixed space - time dimension , in our case four dimensions .",
    "the way around this is to use notation that is specifically designed to simplify bookkeeping of states in that dimension . in four dimensions the spinor - helicity formalism is especially handy ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "however , without using explicit polarization vectors we can no longer expect the numerators to be strictly local in external momenta .",
    "indeed we will see this phenomenon below .",
    "that said , in these cases , we are able to demand locality for the internal loop momenta .",
    "the nub of the matter is in arriving at a sufficiently general ansatz that is still compact enough to work with . for four - point amplitudes of @xmath0 sym",
    "( at least through four loops ) this is by now a well - understood problem .",
    "it turns out that all of the external state information of a multiloop four - point amplitude can be conveniently packaged in the universal crossing - symmetric prefactor  @xcite ( 1,2,3,4)s_12 s_23 a^tree_4 ( 1,2,3,4 ) = -i ^(8)(q).2.4.2.4 , where @xmath31 is the color - ordered @xmath2-dimensional four - point amplitude for any possible combination of external states ( here suppressed ) , and @xmath32 .",
    "the second expression is given by plugging in the explicit @xmath33 superamplitude .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 are skew - symmetric products of weyl spinors that satisfy the property @xmath36 ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "the delta function is grassmann valued and takes as its argument the overall supermomentum of an @xmath30-point amplitude q^a=_i=1^m_i^_i^a , [ gdelta ] where @xmath37 are grassmann variables , with @xmath38 being a @xmath39 @xmath26-symmetry index , and @xmath40 is a weyl spinor with @xmath41 index @xmath42 ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the remarkable property of @xmath43 is that it can be used to construct very compact four - point graph numerators , of the schematic form n_i ~ k(1,2,3,4 ) ( local  momentum  factor ) , [ localkappa ] where the local factor is built entirely of lorentz products of momenta , as demonstrated up to four loops  @xcite .    for five - point amplitdes in @xmath0 sym , it is not clear _ ab intitio _ what the correct generalization of @xmath43 should be .",
    "fortunately , we will in this paper uncover a set of five - point prefactors that generalizes the behavior of @xmath43 .",
    "the details of the construction are found in ; here we will only summarize the results .",
    "unlike the situation at four points , there is no single unique prefactor , but instead there are a number of prefactors that form a six - dimensional linear space .",
    "for example , for the mhv sector , the various permutations of the following function span this space : _",
    "12345^(8)(q ) , where the external states are encoded in the grassman delta function @xmath44 , with @xmath45 defined in using @xmath46 .",
    "the denominator is the levi - civita invariant , @xmath47 , or the directed volume of vectors @xmath48 .",
    "as will be explained in detail in the next section , there is another set of equally valid mhv prefactors given by the various permutations of the following function : _",
    "12_12345 ^(8)(q ) .",
    "since @xmath49 is totally symmetric in the three last labels , every @xmath50 function can be uniquely specified by the two first labels . for notational compactness",
    ", we will frequently drop the three last labels , as done above . furthermore ,",
    "for higher - loop amplitudes the @xmath51 offers expressions for numerators that in general are more structurally compact than those of the @xmath52 , so we will use the former ones more frequently .    because the @xmath50 functions satisfy the relations _",
    "i=1 ^ 5 _ ij=0 ,   _",
    "ij= -_ji , [ gammarel ] there are only six linearly independent @xmath51 . as mentioned above ,",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath51 functions are completely interchangeable , _",
    "12&=&_12345-_21345 , + _ 12345 & = & ( _ 12 + _ 13 + _ 14 + _ 23 + _",
    "24 + _ 34 ) .",
    "in addition to the simple linear relations ( [ gammarel ] ) , the @xmath50 s satisfy more complicated relations when multiplied by external momentum dependent factors @xmath54 .",
    "for example , 0=(_12 + _ 13 ) ( s_23 - s_45 ) + _",
    "23(s_12 - s_23 ) + _ 45(s_14 - s_15 ) , [ twolooprel ] which through permutations of labels gives five independent linear relations .",
    "such relations play an important role at higher loops as they effectively reduce the number of independent monomials that can be written down .",
    "for example , naive counting suggests that there are @xmath55 independent monomials @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are the five independent external momentum invariants . but using , reduces this number to 25 .",
    "similarly , for monomials @xmath58 there are @xmath59 terms , but after taking into account various linear relations only 66 linearly independent such terms remain  @xcite .    with the @xmath50 ( or @xmath52 )",
    "universal prefactors we can write down simple anstze for the various master graph numerators at @xmath10 loops in the mhv sector , n_i&=&_j , k , n a_i;jk;n _ jk m_n^(l ) , + m^(l)&=&\\{_l^l-1 m_l   |   m_l \\{s_ij , _ ij } } , [ masteransatze ] where the @xmath60 are rational numbers , to be determined .",

    "pq=2 p q , where @xmath66 are the external momenta ( using the convention that the momenta are outgoing in any graph ) . for the five - point amplitudes",
    "one can simply use the parity ( or complex ) conjugate expressions of @xmath50 ( and @xmath52 ) functions , so we will not elaborate on this case further .",
    "note that the numerators in are not quite local in external momenta , as the @xmath50 ( and @xmath52 ) functions all have a spurious divergence when the volume of @xmath48 vanishes . however , the remaining factors @xmath67 , which contains the loop momenta , are strictly local for @xmath68 .",
    "remarkably , this appears to be the perfect balance of local and nonlocal factors .",
    "as we will explicitly demonstrate in this paper and in the forthcoming  @xcite , the anstze  ( [ masteransatze ] ) are sufficient to capture the full amplitude through at least three loops .",
    "this strongly suggests that the anstze sufficiently describe the five - point amplitude numerators at any loop order for the @xmath0 sym theory ",
    "an assertion to be verified order by order in the absence of a direct proof .",
    "interestingly , the anstze  ( [ masteransatze ] ) can even be extended to tree level @xmath69 as verified in a parallel work by brdel and one of the current authors  @xcite .    in the final step ,",
    "after having imposed the functional equations on the anstze , the remaining free parameters in the master numerators are fixed by comparing against quantitative information from the theory .",
    "for example , generalized unitarity , especially maximal cuts  @xcite , prove to be a useful tool for this .",
    "at this point , since the duality between color and kinematics is still a conjecture , a complete verification of the constructed amplitude must of course occur ; again unitarity is usually most convenient for this  @xcite . if such verification fails then additional freedom is needed in the initial anstze , and one must begin the procedure again . if some free parameters remain even after all @xmath2-dimensional cuts are satisfied , then these correspond to `` generalized gauge transformations ''  @xcite that respect the duality and leave the full amplitude invariant .",
    "these parameters can be set to any convenient value , as they will cancel out in the full amplitude as guaranteed by the unitarity method  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we construct the duality - satisfying one - loop five - point amplitudes of @xmath0 sym and @xmath1 supergravity . the major task in this construction",
    "is to find the proper ansatz for the numerators , that is , finding the @xmath52 and @xmath50 functions discussed in the previous section . in this section",
    "we will assume the @xmath52 and @xmath50 are unknown functions entering the one - loop numerators , and the effort will be to determine these .",
    "the one - loop five - point amplitude depends on two types of cubic graphs , a pentagon and a box diagram , shown in .",
    "their corresponding numerators will be denoted by n^(p)(1,2,3,4,5;p )  and  n^(b)(1,2,3,4,5;p ) , where the first five numeric arguments collectively encode the external state and kinematic dependence , and the last argument is the loop momentum @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , we could have triangle , bubble and tadpole diagrams entering the five - point one - loop amplitude ; however , these are not expected to show up in maximally supersymmetric theories at one loop , so we will set the kinematic factors of these diagrams to be zero , which is later verified using unitarity cuts .",
    "we can write down three relevant kinematic jacobi relations for the diagrams in n^(b)(1,2,3,4,5 ; p)&=&n^(p)(1,2,3,4,5;p)-n^(p)(2,1,3,4,5;p ) , [ mastereq1 ] + 0=n^(tri_2)(1,2,3,4,5;p)&=&n^(b)(1,2,3,4,5;p)-n^(b)(1,2,4,3,5;p ) , [ mastereq2 ] + 0=n^(tri_1)(1,2,3,4,5;p)&=&n^(b)(1,2,3,4,5;p)-n^(b)(1,2,4,5,3;p+k_3 ) .",
    "[ mastereq3 ] as mentioned above , we immediately set the triangle numerators @xmath70 and @xmath71 to zero , since we expect them to not be present in the amplitude .",
    "next , we write down the dihedral symmetry condition of the pentagon n^(p)(2,3,4,5,1;p+k_1)&=&n^(p)(1,2,3,4,5;p ) , + n^(p)(5,4,3,2,1;-p)&=&-n^(p)(1,2,3,4,5;p ) .",
    "[ dihedral ] similarly we have two flip symmetries for the box n^(b)(2,1,3,4,5;p)&=&-n^(b)(1,2,3,4,5;p ) , + n^(b)(1,2,5,4,3;-k_1-k_2-p)&=&n^(b)(1,2,3,4,5;p ) .",
    "using we can easily solve the box numerator in terms of the pentagon numerator .",
    "thus , all the above constraints can be translated into functional equations satisfied by @xmath72 . to solve these",
    "we must write down an ansatz compatible with the expected structure of the amplitude .",
    "in particular , from general field - theoretic considerations , we expect there to be at least one solution for the gluonic amplitudes where the numerators are local polynomials , using polarization vectors and momentum dot products .",
    "however , here we wish to obtain a compact representation of the amplitude , thus we will avoid explicit polarization vectors as they carry a large amount of redundancy due to the mismatch of lorentz and little group indices .    having no natural building blocks for the one - loop five - point amplitude we need to be cautious with the ansatz , ensuring we parametrize all our ignorance when writing it down .",
    "since we are looking for an amplitude where the internal loop momentum is @xmath2-dimensional , it makes sense to assume that the numerators are built out of local lorentz products of the loop momentum , but the external four - dimensional states and momenta may give rise to nonlocalities . by simply counting the number of vertices in each graph",
    "we conclude that the numerators are of dimensionality 5 .",
    "this implies that there can be at most five powers of loop momentum in the numerators ; however , we naively expect the four - fold supersymmetry to convert four of these powers into an overall supermomentum delta function , n^(p ) ^(8)(q ) , leaving us with at most one power of loop momentum .",
    "we start with an ansatz consistent with the dihedral symmetry of the pentagon integral , n^(p)(1,2,3,4,5;p)=_12345+_12345l_1 ^ 2+_23451l_2 ^ 2+_34512l_3 ^ 2+_45123l_4 ^ 2+_51234l_5 ^ 2 [ pansatz ] where @xmath73 are the momenta of the five internal lines , and @xmath52 and @xmath42 are unknown functions of the external states and momenta .",
    "this ansatz has one more power of @xmath64 than we require , however , writing the amplitude in terms of inverse propagators @xmath74 turns out to be more convenient for the following discussion . to make @xmath72 fully compatible with the dihedral symmetry ( [ dihedral ] )",
    "the coefficient functions must satisfy the following relations : _",
    "abcde=-_baedc , _",
    "abcde=_bcdea , _",
    "abcde=-_baedc , [ brels ] which means that there are twelve distinct @xmath52 s .    for the box diagram we will also use an ansatz , although , in principle it is not needed since implicitly generates an ansatz for @xmath75 .",
    "however , assuming a well - behaved ansatz for @xmath75 will greatly simplify the subsequent discussion .",
    "as is well known , the one - loop @xmath0 amplitudes in @xmath33 can be represented using only scalar box integrals , where the numerators are free of loop - momentum dependence .",
    "hence , we have reason to believe that box diagrams in the duality - satisfying @xmath0 amplitudes will also be scalar integrals",
    ". therefore , we use an ansatz free of loop momentum , n^(b)(1,2,3,4,5;p)=_12345 , which is antisymmetric in the first two indices , and symmetric in interchange of 3rd and 5th , _",

    "[ gsym ] next we need to impose the kinematic jacobi relations , but first a comment about the potential redundancy of the above anstze .",
    "the explicit appearance of loop - momentum invariants @xmath74 in @xmath72 allows the pentagon to carry the exact same potential contact term as in @xmath76 carried by @xmath49 .",
    "both such terms would correspond to a scalar box integral in the common one - loop terminology .",
    "the introduction of this apparent redundancy is , however , well motivated .",
    "a lesson learned at higher loops  @xcite , as well as at tree level  @xcite , is that contact terms in duality - satisfying representations have highly preferred assignment to specific cubic graphs . in general representations ,",
    "contact terms enjoy the freedom of being shuffled around , but for a duality - satisfying representation there is a delicate balance of freedom and constraints that the contact terms must obey .",
    "so prior to constructing the one - loop duality - satisfying amplitude , one does not know whether the scalar box contributions belong to @xmath75 or @xmath72 , or both . in  , we show that the potential redundancy is indeed a true redundancy ; the duality - satisfying amplitude will allow us to make a choice that is consistent with having no scalar boxes in @xmath72 .      from eqs .",

    "the forms of the five - point two - loop divergences are compatible with the logarithmic divergences observed for the four - point amplitudes of the same theories  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the precise four - point divergences are recovered in the factorization channels @xmath119 . although there are some local terms present in ( [ twoloopsymdiv ] ) and ( [ twoloopsgdiv ] ) , they seem closely tied to the terms with poles , suggesting that the former terms are simply the gauge - invariant completions of the singular terms .",
    "it is therefore likely that the counterterms at five points remain the same as at four points ; namely , they are of the schematic forms @xmath143 and @xmath144 for gluon and graviton components , respectively",
    ". a direct calculation of the counterterm contributions to the five - point amplitudes would resolve any doubt .",
    "in this paper we have presented the one- and two - loop five - point amplitudes of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory and @xmath1 supergravity , valid for any value of the dimensional regularization parameter @xmath2 , and for any yang - mills gauge group .",
    "the amplitudes are given in a representation that satisfies the duality between color and kinematic structures of each individual integral diagram .",
    "these amplitudes have been verified using a combination of four - dimensional and @xmath2-dimensional unitarity cuts .",
    "this shows that the duality is present for these particular amplitudes of the two theories , and strongly suggests that other multiloop and multileg amplitudes of these theories should similarly obey the duality . in the accompanying paper  @xcite , the duality - satisfying three - loop five - point amplitudes of the same two theories",
    "are worked out using methods identical to those presented here , thus adding further evidence in favor of the conjecture .",
    "as can be expected from the duality between color and kinematics , the @xmath1 supergravity amplitudes presented here have the property that individual diagram numerators are double copies of the corresponding ones of the @xmath0 sym theory .",
    "this provides further evidence for the claims that gravity theories are simply double copies of gauge theories , order by order , in perturbation theory  @xcite . to see this structural simplicity of gravity one must treat the kinematic structures on equal footing with gauge - group color structures , as done for the presented amplitudes .",
    "in the course of this work we have clarified the general structure of duality - satisfying five - point amplitudes in @xmath0 sym theory and @xmath1 supergravity .",
    "the @xmath0 sym amplitudes have a natural decomposition in terms of six independent nonlocal kinematic prefactors , the remaining factors entering the diagram numerators are strictly local . a natural question is if higher - point amplitudes offer a similar decomposition ; an investigation of the six - point one- and two - loop amplitudes would provide an excellent testing ground . also of interest would be to explore one - loop five- and six - point amplitudes where the external momenta are in @xmath145 dimensions ; knowing the explicit @xmath2-dimensional duality - satisfying forms will be helpful for understanding the constraints imposed by the duality .",
    "although the duality at loop level has been observed for the two - loop four - point all - plus - helicity qcd amplitude , much of the evidence derives from the maximally supersymmetric theories .",
    "arriving at duality - satisfying amplitudes for less - than - maximal supersymmetric theories is therefore of vital importance for the conjecture .",
    "one - loop amplitudes are by now well - studied in many theories , thus one would expect that the task of finding many interesting one - loop examples supporting the duality should be within reach .",
    "exploring the duality at higher - loop levels should also be readily accomplishable .",
    "indeed in parallel work with bern , dixon and roiban we demonstrate that the duality between color and kinematics can easily be established at four loops for the @xmath0 sym and @xmath1 supergravity theories . continuing this to",
    "even higher loops should make it possible to further address the question of the ultraviolet behavior of @xmath1 supergravity .",
