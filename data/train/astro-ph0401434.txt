    "the pattern of galaxy clustering can be quantified by measuring the galaxy count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) on a range of smoothing scales .",
    "the cpdf gives the probability that a randomly chosen region of the universe will contain a particular number of galaxies , and is typically expressed as a function of both the size of the region smoothed over and the galaxy number within that volume .",
    "traditionally , most effort has been directed at measuring the second moment of the count distribution , the variance , @xmath4 , through the autocorrelation function or , equivalently , its fourier transform , the power spectrum ( e.g. percival et al .",
    "2001 ; padilla & baugh 2003 ; tegmark et al .",
    "the higher order moments of the cpdf , expressed as volume averaged correlation functions , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , provide a much more detailed description of galaxy clustering , probing the shape of the low and high count tails of the distribution .",
    "the higher order moments of the dark matter distribution are known to display a hierarchical scaling in which the @xmath0-point volume averaged correlation functions , @xmath5 , can be written in terms of the variance of the count distribution , @xmath4 : @xmath7 ( e.g. see peebles 1980 , juszkiewicz , bouchet & colombi 1993 , bernardeau 1994 , baugh , gaztaaga & efstathiou 1995 , gaztaaga & baugh 1995 , fosalba & gaztaaga 1998 ) .",
    "this scaling is a signature of the evolution under gravitational instability of an initially gaussian distribution of density fluctuations .",
    "a remarkable feature of the scaling is that the values of the hierarchical amplitudes , @xmath8 , on scales for which the density field evolves linearly or in a quasi - linear fashion , are insensitive to cosmic epoch and essentially independent of the cosmological density parameter or the value of the cosmological constant . for a comprehensive review of such results",
    "see bernardeau et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and references therein .",
    "departures from the hierarchical scaling of the higher order moments could conceivably arise in three ways :    * a strongly non - gaussian distribution of primordial density waves as could arise , for instance , due to a seed non - linear fluctuation such as a global texture ( see gaztaaga & mahonen 1996 , gaztaaga & fosalba 1998 , scoccimarro , sefusatti & zaldarriaga 2003 for examples of how the @xmath8 scale in this case ) .",
    "this avenue now seems unlikely , following the clear detection of multiple acoustic peaks in the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations ( netterfield et al . 2002 ; hinshaw et al .",
    "2003 ; mason et al . 2003 ; scott et al .",
    "2003 ; kuo et al .",
    "2004 ) ; such peaks are difficult to reconcile with models that include cosmological defects ( kamionkowski & kowsowsky 1999 ) .",
    "moreover strongly non - gaussian primordial fluctuations are ruled out by the first year wmap results ( komatsu et al .",
    "2003 ; gaztaaga & wagg 2003 ) * a weakly non - gaussian distributed primordial density field , resulting from a non - linear perturbation to a gaussian density field .",
    "this scenario is difficult to distinguish from the evolution of an initially gaussian field under gravitational instability , because the perturbation can introduce a shift to the amplitudes @xmath8 that is also hierarchical .",
    "this can happen even in the case where the non - linear perturbation produces a negligible effect on the power spectrum ( bernardeau et al . 2002 ) .",
    "* the spatial bias between the galaxy distribution and the underlying distribution of dark matter .",
    "fry & gaztaaga ( 1993 ) demonstrated that , under a local biasing prescription , the hierarchical scaling of the higher order moments is preserved but the amplitudes @xmath8 can change as a function of time or luminosity .",
    "this conclusion is also reached using more sophisticated , physically motivated semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( kauffmann et al . 1999 ; benson et al . 2000 ; scoccimarro et al . 2001 ) .",
    "previous attempts to measure the higher order correlation functions have been hamstrung by the small size of the available redshift surveys , a shortcoming that is exacerbated once volume limited subsamples are constructed ( hui & gaztaaga 1999 ) . nevertheless , early counts - in - cells studies established that the first few higher order moments of the galaxy distribution displayed the hierarchical scaling expected in the gravitational instability framework ( groth & peebles 1977 ; peebles 1980 ; gaztaaga 1992 ; bouchet et al . 1993",

    "such analyses were typically limited to measuring the three and four point correlation functions .",
    "the nature of the dependence of the hierarchical amplitudes on luminosity has not been convincingly established .",
    "recent work to investigate this in the optical ( hoyle et al .",
    "2000 ) and in the far infrared ( szapudi et al .",
    "2000 ) was restricted to probing fairly narrow ranges of luminosity due to the size of the redshift surveys then available .",
    "the advent of multi - fibre spectrographs exploited by sustained observing campaigns has led to a new generation of redshift survey which represents order of magnitude advances over surveys completed in the last millennium .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al . 2000 ) and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , colless et al .",
    "2001 ) have provided maps of the clustering pattern of galaxies with unprecedented detail .",
    "analysis of the 2dfgrs clustering has suggested that the flux limited sample could be an essentially unbiased tracer of the dark matter in the universe ( lahav et al .",

    "the 2dfgrs covers a volume that is an appreciable fraction of that sampled by the apm survey , with full redshift coverage ( modulo the relatively small redshift incompleteness that still remains ) .",
    "this means that for the first time , a measurement of the higher order moments is possible in three dimensions with comparable accuracy to that attainable in two dimensions , but without the added complication of the effects of projection ( bernardeau & gaztaaga 1996 ; szapudi & gaztaaga 1998 ) .",

    "kurtosis_. the hierarchical scaling of the higher order moments arises from the evolution due to gravitational instability of an initially gaussian distribution of density fluctuations ( see bernardeau et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to sampling errors ( see section 3.3 below ) , the estimation of the hierarchical amplitudes can be compromised by systematic effects , as discussed in some detail by hui & gaztaaga ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors identified two sources of error that could lead to a systematic bias in the inferred values of @xmath8 .",
    "the first effect arises from biases in the estimates of the higher order correlation functions themselves , known as the `` integral constraint bias '' ( see e.g. bernstein 1994 ) .",
    "the second effect originates in the nonlinear combination of @xmath43 and @xmath44 to form @xmath8 ; this is called the `` ratio bias '' .",
    "the latter effect dominates on large scales and tends to cause the inferred values of the @xmath8 to be biased low .",
    "hui & gaztaaga wrote down expressions for these biases which accurately reproduce the systematic effects seen upon estimating the hierarchical amplitudes from sub - volumes extracted from n - body simulations .",
    "as mentioned above , we will use different volume limited samples to study the luminosity dependence of the hierarchical amplitudes , @xmath8 . as the luminosity that defines a sample",
    "is made brighter , the volume of the sample increases .",
    "thus the estimation biases tend to cause the @xmath8 to increase with sample luminosity .",
    "this spurious tendency has already been reported in the literature ( see hui & gaztaaga 1999 ) . for volumes of the size used in our analysis ,",
    "it turns out that the predicted biases are smaller than the corresponding sampling errors ( e.g. see figure  3 in hui & gaztaaga 1999 ) .",
    "this is the first time that a redshift survey has been available which is large enough to overcome such systematic biases .",
    "galaxy samples constructed using different selection criteria display different clustering patterns .",
    "this leads one to the conclusion that distinct samples of galaxies must trace the underlying mass distribution in different ways , a phenomenon that is generally known as galaxy bias .",
    "a simple , heuristic scheme describing the impact of a local bias on the scaling of the higher order moments was proposed by fry & gaztaaga ( 1993 ) .",
    "these authors demonstrated that in this case , the scaling of the higher order moments of the galaxy distribution should mirror that of the dark matter , though possibly with different values for the hierarchical amplitudes @xmath8 .",
    "fry & gaztaaga made the assumption that the density contrast in the galaxy distribution , @xmath45 , i.e. the fractional fluctuation around the mean density , could be written as a taylor expansion of the density contrast of the dark matter , @xmath46 : @xmath47 on scales where the variance , @xmath48 , is small , the leading order contribution to the two - point volume averaged correlation function of galaxies has the form :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the ubiquitous linear bias @xmath51 .",

    "this is a simple model but nevertheless it shows some tendencies that are correct .",
    "for example , a typical mass halo corresponding to @xmath66 displays an unbiased variance with @xmath67 , but introduces a bias in the skewness , since @xmath68 . as a further illustration , consider massive halos defined by @xmath69 ; in this case the mo , jing & white theory predicts that @xmath70 , while less massive halos could produce @xmath71 . to get more realistic values of @xmath57 for galaxy bias ,",

    "the density of galaxies is a strong function of radial distance .",
    "this effect needs to be taken into account in clustering analyses ( for an example of a technique appropriate to a counts - in - cells analysis , see efstathiou et al .",
    "alternatively , one may construct volume limited samples in which the radial selection function is constant and any variations in the density of galaxies are due only to large scale structure .",
    "this greatly simplifies the analysis at the expense of using a subset of the survey galaxies .",
    "the 2dfgrs contains enough galaxies and covers sufficient volume to permit the construction of volume limited samples corresponding to a wide baseline in luminosity from which robust measurements of the higher order correlation functions can be obtained .",

    "the samples are defined by a specified absolute magnitude range , with absolute magnitudes corrected to zero redshift ( this correction is made using the @xmath91 correction given by norberg et al .",
    "as any survey has , in practice , a bright as well as a faint flux limit , this implies that a selected galaxy should fall between a minimum ( @xmath92 ) and a maximum ( @xmath93 ) redshift .",
    "this then guarantees that all sample galaxies are visible within the flux limits of the survey when displaced to any depth within the volume of the sample .",
    "the properties of the combined ngp and sgp volume limited samples examined in this paper are given in table  1 .",
    "there are two possible sources of incompleteness that need to be considered when estimating the galaxy count within a cell .",
    "the first is volume incompleteness , which can arise when some fraction of the cell volume samples a region of space that is not part of the 2dfgrs .",
    "this situation can arise because the survey has a complicated boundary and also because it contains holes excised around bright stars and other interlopers in the parent apm galaxy catalogue ( maddox et al .",
    "1990 , 1996 ) .",
    "the second source of incompleteness is spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "the final 2dfgrs catalogue is much more homogeneous than the 100k release ( contrast the completeness mask of the final survey shown in figure  1 of hawkins et al .",
    "2003 with the equivalent mask depicted in figure  15 of colless et al . 2001 . )",
    "however , the spectroscopic completeness still varies with position on the sky and needs to be incorporated into the counts - in - cells analysis .",
    "it is therefore necessary to devise a strategy to compensate for the fact that a cell will sample regions that have varying spectroscopic completeness and which may even straddle the survey boundary or a hole .",

    "the galaxy count within the sphere of radius @xmath96 then contributes to the cpdf at the effective radius @xmath22 .",

    "an alternative method to correct cell counts is described in efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . in this commonly used approach",

    "this issue is investigated further in section [ s : system ] .",

    "for which the variance drops below @xmath106 , the measured moments depart somewhat from the hierarchical scaling behaviour , particularly in the case of the higher orders .",
    "the hierarchical scaling of the higher order correlation functions is exploited to plot the hierarchical amplitudes @xmath107 as a function of cell radius in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp ] .",
    "each panel corresponds to a different volume limited sample , where the lines and points correspond to @xmath3 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 in order of increasing amplitude .",
    "the hierarchical amplitudes measured from the two brightest volume limited samples systematically show an increase around @xmath110mpc .",
    "this effect is particularly significant in the @xmath111 sample , with the @xmath8 increasing by a factor of 2 to 5 depending on @xmath0 . on smaller scales the hierarchical amplitudes",
    "are essentially independent of the cell radius for all magnitude ranges considered .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath8 measured in real space vary more strongly in amplitude with scale than in redshift space , particularly at small cell radii ( gaztaaga 1994 ; szapudi et al .",
    "1995 , szapudi & gaztaaga 1998 ) .",
    "we have fit constant values to the measured @xmath8 , using the principal component analysis outlined in section 3.3 .",
    "this approach takes into account the correlations between the measurements on different scales .",
    "the range of scales used to fit @xmath8 is held fixed for each volume limited sample and is quoted in table  2 . typically , there are ten values of @xmath8 in the range considered in the fits .",
    "the principal component analysis reveals that just @xmath112 linear combinations of these points account for more than @xmath113% of the variance ; this gives a fairer impression of the number of independent data points .",
    "the principal eigenvector is in all cases almost independent of scale , i.e. its effect is to move all the points coherently up and down ( driven by large scale variation in the mean density estimated from the survey ) .",
    "therefore , the best fitting constant tends to favour a fit either slightly above or below each set of data points .",
    "this is exactly what is seen in the various panels of fig .",
    "the best fit constants to the measured @xmath8 are given in table  2 , along with an error from the principal component analysis .",

    "this behaviour is explored in section  5 .",
    "the higher order moments of the cpdf are sensitive to the presence of massive structures that contribute to the extreme event tail of the count distribution .",
    "it is therefore important to examine the 2dfgrs to look for any rare large scale structures that could exert a significant influence on the form of the cpdf .",
    "the projected density of galaxies in the right ascension - redshift plane for a volume limited catalogue defined by the magnitude range @xmath116 is plotted in figure  1 of baugh et al .",
    "there are two clear hot spots or superstructures apparent in this figure , one in the ngp at a redshift of @xmath117 and a right ascension of 3.4 hours , and the other in the sgp at @xmath118 at a right ascension of @xmath119 hours .",
    "these structures are confirmed as superclusters of galaxies in the group catalogue constructed from the flux limited 2dfgrs ( eke et al .",
    "2004 ) ; of the 94 groups in the full flux limited survey out to @xmath120 with 9 or more members and estimated masses above @xmath121 , 20% reside in these superclusters . as a result of the redshift at which these superclusters lie , these structures are only influential in volume limited samples brighter than @xmath122 .    the results presented earlier in this section show features that could be due to the presence of these superclusters .",
    "for example , the volume averaged correlation functions for the @xmath116 sample plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : xip ] appear to have more power on large scales than those measured from the other volume limited samples .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical expectations for measurements that are strongly affected by the presence of a supercluster : a boost in the clustering amplitude on large scales , due to a structure with a larger bias , and a reduction in the clustering amplitude on small scales arising from the large velocity dispersions within the clusters making up the structure .    to investigate this hypothesis ,",
    "we have carried out the test of removing the two superclusters from the sample and recomputing the volume averaged correlation functions .",
    "the goal of this exercise is not to `` correct '' the measured correlation functions but rather to illustrate the impact of the superclusters on our results .",
    "we remove the superclusters by masking out their central densest regions , corresponding to prohibiting the placement of cells within a sphere of radius @xmath123mpc from each supercluster centre ( for a different approach on how to take this type of effect into account see colombi , bouchet & schaeffer 1994 and fry & gaztaaga 1994 ) .",
    "[ fig : pn ] shows the effect of the supercluster removal on the tail of the cpdf for @xmath110mpc radius cells , calculated for three volume limited catalogues centred on @xmath124 .",
    "the mean number of galaxies in a cell for each galaxy sample is roughly @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath105 going from faintest to brightest .",
    "the presence of the two superclusters makes a clear difference to the high @xmath20 counts for galaxy samples brighter than @xmath127 .",
    "the maximum redshift of the faint volume limited catalogue in this figure only marginally includes the ngp supercluster , and so @xmath128 remains essentially unaffected in this case .",
    "[ fig : xip2 ] shows volume averaged correlation functions of order @xmath129 for three volume limited catalogues from table  1 , where each panel corresponds to a fixed absolute magnitude range .",
    "the lines correspond to different orders of clustering , starting with the lowest in amplitude , the two point volume averaged correlation function , and moving through to the four point function , at which we stop plotting the results for clarity although the trends shown continue up to sixth order .",
    "the solid curves show the correlation functions measured from the full volume limited samples , as shown previously in fig .  6 , and the dashed lines show the results when the regions containing the superclusters are excluded from the cpdf .",
    "the higher order correlation functions are systematically boosted on intermediate and large scales when the superclusters are included in the analysis .",
    "the precise scale on which the correlation functions become sensitive to the presence of the superclusters depends upon the order ; for the four point function , the two estimates of the correlation function typically deviate for cells of radius @xmath130mpc and larger .",

    "the filled symbols show the results obtained from the same volume but with the supercluster regions masked out .",

    "in this section we quantify how the hierarchical amplitudes scale with galaxy luminosity and discuss the implications of our results for simple models of galaxy bias .",
    "we first test the hypothesis set out in section 2.4 that the variation in clustering with luminosity apparent in fig .  [",

    "[ eq : br ] .",
    "the relative bias factors , @xmath131 , computed from the variance and the deviation from the linear bias model , as quantified by @xmath132 ( eq .  [ eq : c2 ] ) , are listed in table  2 ; here the mean value is given by the best @xmath115 fit over all cell radii .",
    "the change in the amplitude of the relative bias with sample luminosity , shown in fig .",
    "4 , is in excellent agreement with the trend found by norberg et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who analysed the projected spatial clustering of 2dfgrs galaxies .",
    "this agreement is remarkable given the different approaches used to measure the two - point correlations and the fact that the analysis in this paper is in redshift space , whereas the study carried out by norberg et al .",
    "was unaffected by peculiar motions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath132 are different from zero at a 1-@xmath133 level .",
    "these findings are consistent with a small deviation from the linear biasing model ( at a 2-sigma level for the brighter samples ) .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the estimation of @xmath134 using the the bispectrum ( scoccimarro 2000 , verde et al .",
    "2002 ) or the 3-point function measured from the parent apm galaxy survey ( frieman & gaztaaga 1999 ) .",

    "the dotted line shows the hierarchical amplitudes predicted by the linear relative bias model ( eq .  15 ) , using the best fit bias factors stated in table  2 .",
    "this model gives a rough approximation to the data .",
    "however , the observed variation of @xmath8 with luminosity is somewhat better described by a linear fit in the logarithm of luminosity , as shown by the solid lines .",
    "this implies that the dependence of the hierarchical amplitudes on luminosity is more complicated than expected in the simple relative bias model of eq .",
    "[ eq : sjlinear ] ( as does the fact that we find some evidence for non - zero values for @xmath132 ) .",
    "the solid lines show the best linear fit to the hierarchical amplitudes as a function of the logarithm of the median luminosity of the samples : @xmath135 we find a greater than @xmath136 ( @xmath137 for two parameters ) detection of a non - zero value for @xmath138 . however , for @xmath139 , the constraints on @xmath140 are much weaker and there is no clear evidence for a luminosity dependence in the @xmath8 values in these cases . for completeness ,",
    "the best fit values for each order are : @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "in this paper we have measured the higher order correlation functions of galaxies in volume limited samples drawn from the 2dfgrs .",
    "the most recent comparable work is the analysis of the stromlo - apm and ukst redshift surveys by hoyle , szapudi & baugh ( 2000 ) .",
    "these authors also considered volume limited subsamples drawn from the flux limited redshift survey . the largest ukst sample considered by hoyle et al . contained 500 galaxies and covered a volume of @xmath145 ;",
    "the reference sample used in our work contains 90 times this number of galaxies and covers ten times the volume . in our analysis",
    ", we can follow the variation of clustering over more than a decade in luminosity , whereas hoyle et al . had to focus their attention around @xmath9 .",
    "the measurement of the higher order galaxy correlation functions is still challenging , however . in spite of the order of magnitude increase in size that the 2dfgrs represents over previously completed surveys , we have found that the higher order moments that we measure are somewhat sensitive to the presence of large structures . in particular , there are two superclusters that influence our measurements , one in the sgp region and the other in the ngp .",
    "these structures contain a sizeable fraction of the cluster mass groups in the 2dfgrs ( eke et al .",
    "the inclusion of these structures has an impact on our estimates of the three point and higher order volume averaged correlation functions on scales around @xmath146mpc and above , depending on the order of the correlation function .",
    "for this reason , we have presented measurements of the higher order correlation functions both with and without these structures .",
    "we stress that the removal of these superclusters should not be considered a correction to the full catalogue results , but rather as an indication of the impact of rare structures on our results for the higher order moments . on the other hand , the up - turn that we find in the values of the hierarchical amplitudes on large scales",
    "is predicted by some structure formation models ; for example models with non - gaussian initial density fields predict a similar form for the @xmath8 as we measure from the full volume limited samples ( gaztaaga & mhnen 1996 ; gaztaaga & fosalba 1998 ; bernardeau et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the difficulties in estimating @xmath8 values on large , quasi - linear scales ( @xmath147mpc ) , prevent a direct comparison with perturbation theory ( see bernardeau et al .",
    "the current best estimates on these scales are still those measured from the angular apm galaxy survey ( gaztaaga 1994 , szapudi et al .",
    "1995 , szapudi & gaztaaga 1998 ) . at the time of writing , the results from the sdss early data release are still limited to small scales ( gaztaaga 2002 , szapudi et al .",
    "despite being unable to make a robust measurement of the higher order correlation functions on the very large scales for which weakly non - linear perturbation theory is applicable , we are still able to reach a number of interesting conclusions :    * we have demonstrated that the higher order galaxy correlation functions measured from the 2dfgrs follow a hierarchical scaling .",
    "baugh et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that @xmath9 galaxies display higher order correlation functions that scale in a hierarchical fashion ; we have extended these authors analysis to cover a wide range of galaxy luminosity .",
    "the higher order moments of the galaxy count distribution are proportional to the variance raised to a power that depends upon the order of the correlation function under consideration .",
    "this behaviour holds on physical scales ranging from those on which we expect the underlying density fluctuations to be strongly nonlinear all the way through to quasi - linear scales .",
    "this scaling has been tested up to the six point correlation function for the first time using a redshift survey .",
    "this confirms the conclusions of a complementary analysis carried out by croton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who found hierarchical scaling when measuring the reduced void probability function of the 2dfgrs .",
    "* we have estimated values of the hierarchical amplitudes , @xmath148 , for cells of different radii .",
    "the hierarchical amplitudes are approximately constant on small to medium scales ( depending on the order considered ) , while for the larger volumes , @xmath8 seem to increase with radius at large scales .",
    "although this could in principle result from a boundary or mask effect ( e.g. see szapudi & gaztaaga 1998 ; bernardeau et al .",
    "2002 ) , we have shown with mock catalogues that this is not the case here ( e.g. see fig .  1 ) .",
    "if the two most massive superclusters in the survey are removed from the analysis , the hierarchical amplitudes are remarkably independent over all scales . that the @xmath8 are roughly constant on small scales , with smaller amplitudes than in real space ( e.g. gaztaaga 1994 ) ,",
    "has been noted before for measurements in redshift space .",
    "it arises due to a cancellation of the enhanced signal on small scales in real space by a damping of clustering in redshift space due to peculiar motions ( lahav et al . 1993 ; fry & gaztaaga 1994 ; hivon et al .",
    "1995 ; hoyle et al .",
    "2000 ; bernardeau et al .",
    "* we find that the amplitude of the higher order correlation functions scales with luminosity .",
    "the magnitude of the luminosity segregation increases with the order of the correlation ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "for the variance , @xmath4 , the strength of the trend is in very good agreement with that reported by norberg et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but note that these authors measured the luminosity segregation in real space , whereas our results are in redshift space . the strength of the luminosity segregation for higher orders can be mostly explained as the result of hierarchical scaling @xmath149 , so that most of the effect can be attributed to luminosity segregation in the variance .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  5 where data from different luminosities trace out the same hierarchical curve with little scatter .",
    "* we find some evidence for a residual dependence of @xmath8 on luminosity , although the effect is only significant within the errors for the skewness @xmath52 ( greater than @xmath150 level ) .",
    "it is not clear whether this is driven by a pure luminosity dependence of the higher order clustering or by a change in the galaxy mix with luminosity , with different galaxy types having different @xmath8 or by a combination of the two effects : see norberg et al .",
    "( 2002a ) for an investigation of this point for the 2-point correlation function . a simple linear relative bias model ( dotted line in fig .",
    "10 ) does not reproduce the dependence of the @xmath8 on luminosity .",
    "we have interpreted our results in terms of a simple , local bias model , and we have quantified trends in clustering amplitude with luminosity by estimating relative bias factors .",
