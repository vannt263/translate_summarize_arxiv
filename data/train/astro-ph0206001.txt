    "the idea of automating ground based observational astronomy goes back more than two decades .",
    "minimizing manpower can assure uniform and massive data flow with low budget and the absence of human mistakes .",
    "the increasing number of robotic telescopes ( capable of computer controlled multiple observations ) have been used for a broad range of projects , such as astrometry : carlsberg meridian telescope @xcite ; photoelectric photometry of pre - selected targets : fairborn observatory @xcite ; supernova search : kait @xcite ; grb follow - up : rotse @xcite and lotis @xcite , exo - planet searches : stare @xcite , vulcan @xcite ; and asteroid searches : taos @xcite .",
    "the variety of targets is usually narrow , looking only for specific timescales , light - curve shapes and intensity ranges .",
    "although most projects concentrating on special targets gain a huge amount of photometric data , only few of them are capable of presenting their by - products to the astronomical community , e.g.  ogle ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , macho @xcite and rotse @xcite .    initiated by ideas of @xcite ,",
    "the all - sky automated survey s ( asas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) approach is different , in that the final goal has been photometric monitoring of _ all bright stars _ in a major part of the southern sky down to @xmath4 . using a fully automated but inexpensive system consisting of an amateur - class ccd , a small telephoto lens and an equatorial mount , asas presented catalogues of 4000 bright variables from a @xmath5 area of the southern sky , _",
    "96% being new discoveries _ @xcite . the upgraded asas-3 will produce an order of magnitude increase in the data flow . the incompleteness of our knowledge on bright variable stars was reinforced by @xcite who discovered 1781 new variables in a @xmath6 area .",
    "why is general variability study of bright objects important ?",
    "several answers can be found in @xcite , and others can be added .",
    "variable stars are essential for testing stellar structure and evolution theories , examining galactic structure or establishing the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "only bright variables are within the range of high resolution spectroscopy , parallax and proper motion measurements",
    ". our knowledge of issues related to variable stars ( e.g.  distance scale ) can be refined by the combination of detailed study of close - by , bright objects and of equidistant , homogeneous samples ( e.g.  ogle  galactic bulge , lmc , smc ) .",
    "serious incompleteness at the bright end affects all conclusions .",
    "a systematic , well - calibrated survey presents clean , statistically valuable samples with well defined limits for different subtypes of variable objects .",
    "a reliable database with sufficient and ever - growing time - span of light - curves can be used as an archive , for e.g. , correlating optical variability with x - ray observations , made by satellites .",
    "it can be a valuable input to schedule big - telescope and space - mission observations , where telescope time is limited , or prior and longer - term data on field variables is necessary ( e.g.  the kepler mission ) , furthermore , it can provide them with a real - time alert system of rare events .",
    "such events can be nova explosions , helium flash of a star ( sakurai s object : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , super - outbursts of dwarf - novae ( wz sge : * ? ? ?",
    "to mention specific examples , observational data is scarce for spotted red subgiant variables ( rs cvn , fk com ) , which are crucial in understanding the stellar magnetic cycles .",
    "detached eclipsing binaries ( through their stellar mass , radius and luminosity determination ) can be perfect distance and age indicators , if nearby systems are properly calibrated .",
    "samples of such objects in the solar neighborhood are sparse @xcite , partly due to their short and narrow eclipses , and lack of observational data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : twovar ] for our light - curve of a _",
    "semi_-detached binary ) .",
    "bright contact binaries exhibit similar incompleteness , although long - term observations could reveal interesting phenomena , such as the transition to semi - detached state .",
    "the hipparcos space astrometry mission presented us with discovery of a few thousand new bright variables , and the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram was described in terms of luminosity stability at the millimagnitude level @xcite .",
    "however , hipparcos observed only selected stars ( 120000 or @xmath7 ) , and the variable star sample is further limited by the @xmath8 epochs per star on average and cut - off at @xmath9 .",
    "mapping the location of the large variety of pulsating variables on the hr diagram is still far from being complete .",
    "addressing phenomena , such as long - term period and amplitude modulations ( e.g.  blazhko effect of rr lyrae ) , evolution of the pulsational status of a star , is possible only by long - term and _ homogeneous _ observations . given the huge data - flow , interesting phenomena are expected to emerge , for instance further observational evidence for chaos in w vir and rv tau stars",
    "@xcite , triple - mode variables ( gsc 40181807 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cepheids which stop pulsating ( v19 in m33 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or strong amplitude modulation of cepheids ( v473 lyr : * ? ? ?",
    "long - term monitoring of semi - regular and mira variables is needed to disentangle multiperiodicity and systematic amplitude variations ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "the sample of the recently established @xmath10 dor subtype ( oscillations in non - radial gravity - mode ) consists of only a few dozen stars .",
    "one example of the possibilities is our hat-1 light - curve of the triple - mode pulsator ac and ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twovar ] ) .    while the number of robotic telescopes is around a hundred ,",
    "there are only a few completely autonomous observatories , where the human supervision is eliminated , and all auxiliary appliances ( dome , weather station , etc . )",
    "are under a reliable computer control .",
    "these observatories can be installed to remote sites with adequate astro - climate and infrastructure ( electricity , internet ) without need of an on - site observer , and daily maintenance .",
    "the station can be monitored via internet , and operation is not a bottleneck any more .",
    "hat is such a small autonomous observatory intended to carry out a northern counterpart of asas , i.e. , a variability study of the northern sky .",
    "hat was developed and constructed by one professional and three amateur astronomers in hungary , and has been fully operational since may , 2001 at steward observatory , kitt peak , arizona .",
    "hat is controlled by a single linux pc without human supervision .    the 180 mm focal length and 65 mm aperture of the telephoto lens , and",
    "the @xmath11 ccd yields a wide fov : @xmath1 on the sky .",
    "our typical exposure times allow us to study variability of the @xmath12 objects per field brighter than @xmath13 with few percent precision ( @xmath14 ) , and few minute to one year time - resolution . as an extreme of the possible observing tactics , hat is capable of recording the brightness of _ every locally and seasonally _ visible star in the range of @xmath0 in every second day .",
    "our limiting magnitude and photometric precision ( see  [ sec : photprec ] ) corresponds to the following detection _",
    "cut - offs _ for a few selected variability types ( ranges indicate that the distance limit depends on the luminosity within the type ) : @xmath10 doradus stars ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 scuti ( @xmath17 ) , rr lyrae ( @xmath18 ) , cepheids ( @xmath19 ) , miras and semiregular variables ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the limits are based on the luminosity of the sources , and  especially at the larger values  overestimate true detection cut - offs , as they do not take into account reddening and crowding .    with the above specifications ,",
    "hat is also suitable for exo - planet search via transits , which is also included in our program .",
    "however , we concentrate on a broader range of variabilities : a large fraction of the sky is monitored sparsely , and few selected fields frequently so as to have preliminary results on short - period changes .",
    "we expect that our survey will contribute to most of the aforementioned issues related to variability search ( public archive , alert system ) , and supplement the incomplete variable classes by new discoveries .",
    "our current data rate is roughly @xmath21 photometric measurement , or two gigabytes of raw data per night .",
    "typically a few percent of the sources are variable , i.e. , variable light - curves are supplemented by @xmath22 data points each night .",
    "hat is monitoring only a fraction of the northern sky , but given the fact that it is an off - the - shelf system there is perspective for installation of new units in the near future .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows :  [ sec : hardware ] gives an overview on the hardware ,  [ sec : software ] describes our software environment ,  [ sec : astro ] quantifies the pointing precision of hat ,  [ sec : installation ] and  [ sec : obs ] summarize our site - specific installation at kitt peak and observations in the past one year ,  [ sec : photprec ] estimates our photometric precision ,  [ sec : summary ] gives summary and future directions .",
    "the hat hardware consists of an equatorial telescope mount , enclosure ( dome ) , ccd , a telephoto lens and a pc .",
    "several devices are attached to the dome and telescope , such as rain - detector , photosensor , lens - heating and domeflat lights .",
    "the pc is protected from inclement weather by a close - by heated room ( `` warmroom '' ) .",
    "two parallel port cables with lightning protection connect the dome to the pc , and are responsible for driving the telescope and dome devices .",
    "cables for the ccd depend on the specific setup ; in our case a serial line for a meade pictor ccd ( for testing purposes ) and a custom data cable - pair for an apogee ap10 ccd run from the pc to the telescope .",
    "a cable in a separate conduit carries 110v ac to the dome",
    ".      requirements of a mount for massive variability search are : reliability ( for @xmath23 actuation ) , pointing to an accuracy of few orders of magnitude smaller than the fov , ability to recover from awkward positions , never losing orientation , and relatively quick slew - time .",
    "our mount started as a replica of gregorz pojmaski s instrument for all - sky monitoring @xcite , who kindly shared his plans with our group .",
    "the main mechanical concept of the mount is left unchanged , i.e. , it is a backlash - free friction drive of a horseshoe structure .",
    "most of the details and dimensions , however , were re - designed .",
    "the mount is machined from forged aluminum alloy , to minimize the possibility of slow warpage , which could cause uncertainties in the pointing .",
    "all parts are anodized , to yield a tough and resistant surface .",
    "the base of hat is a @xmath24 ( diameter ) disc , which can be mounted on a pier ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mount ] for details of the mount ) .",
    "a rectangular steel plate can smoothly rotate on it , and can be fine - tuned by two adjusting screws , thus enabling the azimuth setting during polar axis adjustments .",
    "the base frame of the telescope is held to the steel plate by a fixed screw and another screw freely running in altitude in a groove , for both sides .",
    "it can be gently adjusted in altitude @xmath25 ( default center is @xmath26 ) with a spindle , much like the azimuth setting , and can be secured with the freely running screw .",
    "inclinations outside these limits can be easily set by tilting the mounting of the base plate .",
    "the horseshoe is supported at three points : the bearing - housing , a loose roller , and the right ascension friction - drive .",
    "the horseshoe outer diameter is @xmath27 with three arms attached to it in @xmath28 spacings , forming a cone with pitch angle of @xmath29 .",
    "the apex of this cone is the bearing housing of the ra axis with a high - precision ball - bearing inside .",
    "as the horseshoe is cut out from a larger piece of plate , relaxation of stress can change its shape , which affects tracking of astronomical objects .",
    "thus , the whole structure is machined on a precision lathe as a piece later .",
    "the horseshoe is constrained to the rollers by strong springs holding an arm and a small bearing running in the circular groove in the inner side of the horseshoe .",
    "the tight contact is crucial for proper positioning , as the not perfectly balanced horseshoe is friction driven , thus  especially at the extreme positions ",
    "torque is needed even for constant motion .",
    "the right ascension is driven by a five - phase stepper motor via sprockets and cogwheels and a stainless - steel roller with combined gear - ratio of @xmath30 microstep of the motor @xmath31 ( arcsec ) movement of the horseshoe .",
    "slipping is further minimized by acceleration and deceleration of the mount in @xmath32 discrete velocity steps in an interval ( `` ramping '' ) , both specified by the user at the software control .",
    "the steel wires of the sprockets prevent them from stretching , and yield a backlash - free drive .",
    "the maximal slew speed is @xmath33 .",
    "the declination axis is made up of two @xmath34 discs attached by bearings to the inner side of the horseshoe , and connected by four lateral bars , two of which hold the instrument - mounting plate . the axis is driven in a similar manner to the ra , i.e. , by a 5-phase stepper , sprocket and cogwheels , but the final resolution is @xmath35 and maximal speed is @xmath36 .    the maximal dimension or a telescope which fits our mount is @xmath37 .",
    "the maximal size of the detector is limited by the inner half - sphere of the horseshoe , but most ccds , such as apogee ap10 ( @xmath38 ) , fit readily .",
    "balance of axes is achieved by counterweights on the top of the horseshoe , on the declination disc and on the instrument - mounting plate .",
    "the telescope ( telephoto lens ) is fixed to the instrument - mounting plate by a converter ring , and rigidly held by screws from the upper two lateral bars connecting the dec discs , while the ccd is attached to the other side .",
    "inductive proximity sensors on both axes detect home and end positions in order to ensure fail - safe operation . even though we use an open - loop control system ( no costly encoder employed ) , and it might happen that the telescope loses orientation ( due to e.g. , power - failure ) , it can quickly recover by an iterative procedure of finding the home position .",
    "physical end positions on both the ra and dec axes guarantee that even if the proximity sensors fail , we can not run off the rollers , and the telescope tube or detector never hits the mount .",
    "polar setting of the mount is simplified by the possibility of fitting a polar telescope to the central hole in the ra bearing house , and crude setting can be achieved in a few minutes .",
    "final setting is done by standard methods such as described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "automated , remote dome operations have to be perfectly fail - safe , because the detector can be damaged by inclement weather conditions , or the sun might edge slowly across the field .",
    "a few of the encountered risks when closing the dome include gusty wind , power outage and failure of control software . in order to minimize software control and construction costs , and to enable rapid observation of targets of opportunity , only mechanisms that completely flip out of the way were considered .",
    "we designed a structure which proved to work in the past one year , with only a few minor failures .",
    "these failures , in turn , aided improvement of the design .",
    "we experimented with simple schemes , such as a lid opening towards the north around the upper edge of the box , but this setup has strong wind resistance during the opening / closing phase .",
    "the standard rollover - roof structure is not compact enough and blocks a considerable part of the sky .",
    "hat mount is enclosed by a @xmath39 weather - proof box ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dome ] for a schematic drawing ) .",
    "a separate slant roof on top is connected to the rest of the dome by swivel joints ; a long bar is attached to its south corner and a shorter bar to the north , on both sides ( assuming an installation on the northern hemisphere ) .",
    "the roof can be opened northwards by rotation around the bottom axes of the two arms , resembling an asymmetric clamshell .",
    "as the lengths of the arms differ , the roof co - rotates in such a way that resistance against wind is minimal in every position , and eventually it gets blocked from the wind behind the bulk of the dome , with its hollow part facing down .",
    "the longer bar has counterweights on the bottom such that the dome closes even if the driving mechanism is broken , simply through gravity .",
    "the shorter bar is fixed to a shaft inside the dome , which is driven by a windshield - wiper dc motor through low gear ratio .",
    "two sensors detect if the dome reached any of its end positions ( closed or open ) .",
    "safety power supply for the motor is a 12v 7.5ah battery , continuously recharged from the main pc power supply of the dome , which in turn is connected to the ups in the warmroom . even without recharging ,",
    "this battery would be able to open / close the dome several times a day for a week , though there is no need for this , as power failures are detected by the software , and the system is automatically shut down . although normally the pc controls dome operations , a light sensor on the bottom of the dome acts as a `` big - brother '' , and closes the dome if illuminance reaches that of a dawn / dusk sky .",
    "similarly , a research grade vaisala rain - detector has the capability of emergency closing .",
    "due to problems with skyflat frames ( see later in  [ sec : obs ] ) a domeflat screen is fixed to the inner north roof , and lit by small bulbs from positions which yield almost even illuminance not affected by the telescope s position . when the telescope is pointed to the north pole ,",
    "the screen is perpendicular to its aperture .",
    "rotation of the entire mount about the pole averages out approx .",
    "half of the residual illuminance pattern .",
    "dome operations can be also performed manually , overriding other control .",
    "all electronics are installed in a separate compartment on the south wall , and can be easily dismounted from the outside for servicing without opening the dome .",
    "the electronic cards and devices in the dome are connected to the 12v dc outputs of a simple pc power supply , which in turn gets power from the warmroom s ups .",
    "some devices are also connected to the re - chargeable battery , and can be operated even during power failure .",
    "one card is responsible for control of the mount , another for all other devices , including the dome .",
    "signals coming from the parallel port of the pc are optically isolated , and micro - controller units convert them for direct control of the stepper motors . cards are simply _ converters _ , and the motordrive / clockdrive is the pc s central processing unit , controlled by the rtlinux os .",
    "hat has been operated with two ccds .",
    "the camera during the test period of 2000/2001 from budapest , konkoly observatory , was an amateur - class * meade pictor 416xt * camera with a kodak kaf-0401e chip of @xmath40 pixels .",
    "this camera yielded noisy images with bad electronic interference pattern and functioned erratically , but was suitable for test - mode operation ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "all astrometric calibration described in  [ sec : astro ] was performed with this ccd .",
    "the current kitt peak setup uses an * apogee ap10 * camera with thomson thx 7899 m @xmath41 , grade 2 chip .",
    "the chip covers @xmath42 , i.e. , comparable to the size of small format photographic films ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "full - well capacity is @xmath44@xmath45 , factory gain setting is @xmath46 , thus given the 14-bit ( 16000 adu ) dynamic range , saturation is slightly limited by the a / d conversion .",
    "quantum efficiency of the thomson chip peaks at 40% between @xmath47 .",
    "readout noise is variable , being @xmath48@xmath45 .",
    "bias level is @xmath49 ( nightly variation ) , with considerable long - term ( day - to - day ) instability of @xmath50 .",
    "dark current at @xmath51c  is @xmath52 and highly dependent on temperature setting ( @xmath53 at @xmath54c ) .",
    "we would like to keep the temperature of the system at a constant level throughout the year for the uniformity of the data .",
    "unfortunately the two - stage peltier cooling is capable of only @xmath55c , and the lowest value we can achieve is @xmath56 .",
    "the camera is connected to the pc by a data and a control cable plugged into an isa - card . the cable length in our setup is 18 m , much longer than the factory default ( 8 m ) , although well below the company - claimed maximum limit .",
    "this caused problems during the installation , and hindered us from using the camera for the first 3 months , as the images contained only a few bits .",
    "typical readout time of a frame is @xmath57 at 1.3mhz speed , so there is negligible dead - time due to readout .",
    "bias frames have a distinct , relatively constant pattern ; few bad columns , many warm pixels , horizontal streaks and clusters of warm pixels .",
    "dark frames have similar structure , which does not completely disappear after bias correction .",
    "about 10% of the frames have anomalous noise and background , the latter is @xmath58 times higher than the normal .",
    "most likely these frames are due to a bug in the readout electronics .      in principle",
    "any kind of telephoto lens or small telescope can be attached to hat s mounting plate , which has dimensions smaller than as described in  [ sec : mount ] .",
    "our choice of a nikon 180 mm f/2.8 manual focus telephoto lens ( @xmath59 ) for the kitt peak setup was motivated by several factors , such as our limited budget , the acceptable quality of nikon lenses , and approximate compatibility with the asas-2 project , which uses 200 mm focal length with the same apogee ccd @xcite .",
    "the resulting fov is @xmath60 , where one pixel corresponds to @xmath61 .",
    "the lens gives moderately sharp profiles throughout the entire field , with half - width of the psf @xmath62 pixel ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the corners show some coma and astigmatism .",
    "there is substantial field - dependent vignetting , reaching a 40% intensity loss near the edges , which is not surprising at lenses designed for small - format photography .",
    "a strong resistive heating of the lens is installed in the light - baffle ( dew cap ) .",
    "this not only prevents formation of dew on the front lens , but also creates turbulence to blur the stellar profiles to some extent .",
    "as our psf is undersampled , we have deliberately blurred the image in this way in an attempt to improve photometry ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and  [ sec : photprec ] ) .",
    "slight defocusing of the lens is not possible , as it introduces strong , spatially dependent distortion of the profiles .",
    "we observe through a single cousins i - band filter ( bessel - made ) , which has favorable combined sensitivity with the thomson chip , yielding considerably higher signal - to - noise ratio for typical stars and integration times than e.g. a v filter would .",
    "the brightness of the night sky is more stable in i - band at different lunar phases @xcite , @xmath64 ( new moon ) to @xmath65 ( full - moon ) , as compared to e.g.  @xmath66 , which ensures more uniform photometry .",
    "new filters can be inserted only manually .      any reasonable ( @xmath67 ) personal computer which can run a linux operating system and real - time kernels .",
    "] , and has two parallel ports , is suitable for controlling the hat mount and dome .",
    "an isa - slot is requisite for controlling the apogee ap10 ccd , and serial line is needed for the meade pictor ccd .",
    "we use a custom - built pc with 900mhz athlon amd processor , 256 mb ram , dat - dds3 tape archiving facility , and a single 80 mb disc for temporary storage .",
    "outgoing cables are lightning - protected .",
    "power is from a ups plugged in the same circuit as the ups for the dome power supply .",
    "a watchdog - card automatically hard - resets the computer if that freezes ( does not respond via a special software ) for more than 10 minutes .",
    "our control pc runs an ordinary linux os with a real - time linux kernel(denoted rtlinux ) .",
    "accurate positioning ( e.g.  sidereal speed tracking ) needs precisely scheduled stepping instructions from the control electronics , with the possibility of frequency tuning ( adjusting the tracking speed ) and switching between speeds ( e.g.  ramping ) .",
    "these are either directly emitted by a complex external hardware with built - in frequency standard , _ or by the computer _ and its central processing unit ( in fact a very complex hardware , but off - the - shelf ) . both approaches have pros and cons , but we found the latter more flexible , because software can be adjusted remotely , and because it requires less hardware development .",
    "the cpu s capability of emitting signals with a tight schedule depends on the os . with `` single task '' operating systems , such as dos ,",
    "proper scheduling of a _ single _ task was possible .",
    "however , a further demand is that simultaneously with signal - generation , one should be able to execute other tasks , such as ccd operation , disc io , etc . , each of them requiring some cpu time , thus distorting the frequency of the high priority processes requesting periodic operations .",
    "rtlinux is such a _ real - time , multitask _ operating system , where the kernel treats the real - time processes as independent `` threads '' with response times better than @xmath68 .",
    "the linux environment , the user s interface , is run at the lowest priority , but on relatively fast pcs and assuming only a few real - time processes with no extreme rescheduling frequencies , there is no noticeable difference to the user .",
    "the software environment consists of low level programs : _ scope and dome drivers , cameraserver , hat access module _ ( ham ) , and high level software : _ central database _ ( db ) and _ virtual observer _ ( `` observer '' ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : software ] for a schematic flowchart .",
    "the telescope mount s kernel driver is mainly responsible for positioning the mount .",
    "it is a character device driver , i.e. , complex commands can be issued to it as ascii strings , which are executed after being parsed .",
    "status information is readable from a special file , showing relative positions in steps , ra and dec , and so on . both axes can independently track ( with any sidereal rate ) , fine - slew or slew ( maximal speed ) .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : mount ] , acceleration and deceleration of the axes is done in finite angular - velocity , or in other words frequency steps , so as to minimize slip of the friction drive .",
    "the `` infinite '' accelerations between the finite velocity levels are in fact smoothed to continuity by the elasticity of the components .",
    "the driver also reads interrupts coming from the proximity sensors indicating the home or end positions .",
    "it can `` home '' the mount ( move marked points on the horseshoe and declination discs precisely above the proximity sensors ) from any unknown position , which is handy for resetting the continuously accumulating slips , and for orientation if the telescope is `` lost '' .",
    "the home position s hour angle and declination is calibrated at the installation of the telescope . after nulling values at the home position , the number of steps taken in any axis and any direction is always stored , and the residuals after a subsequent homing indicate the amount of slip",
    ". the tracking speed can be fine - tuned with a precision of @xmath69 , which means that the hardware element s absolute dimensions ( e.g. , the ratio of the driving roller to the diameter of the horseshoe ) are not that restricted ( but only important in absolute pointing ) .",
    "finally , ra and dec values can be assigned to any position .",
    "the dome driver is a similar rtlinux kernel driver responsible for i ) turning the main power on / off , ii ) closing or opening the dome , iii ) activating lens heating , iv ) control of domeflat lights , v ) detection of rain .",
    "status of the dome can be queried from the driver .",
    "ccd acquisition software of the apogee ap10 ccd is based on the application programming interface from @xcite , modified to fulfill our needs .",
    "the camera server can run as a standalone application , or as a `` daemon '' , accepting commands from other software via internet protocol ( tcp / ip ) .",
    "the so - called hat access module ( ham ) is the main low - level program joining all the aforementioned codes .",
    "it accepts input via tcp / ip from higher level software ( e.g. , the virtual observer ) , parses the commands , and distributes them to the relevant resources .",
    "that is , all telescope , dome and ccd operations are piped through this program .",
    "another aspect of ham is allocation of the drivers , i.e. no other program can issue conflicting commands to the hardware .",
    "we use the fast , reliable and open source relational structured query language ( mysql ) database for storing associated parameters of the station ( setup of mount , telescope , ccd , scheduled tasks , etc . ) , and for keeping continuously accumulating logs of operations ( parameters of archived images , etc . ) , all of them arranged into tables .",
    "this has several advantages over simply keeping information in files without a database wrapper : i ) faster operation on data , ii ) tcp / ip access ( for instance through the internet ) , iii ) use of existing interfaces to mysql from various programming languages .",
    "the smooth tcp / ip communication enables installation of multiple hat observatories in any preferred topology , with central database management , and with the possibility that the sites interact with each other , for example , request the last object observed or instruct another telescope .",
    "the observatory as a whole is managed by the _ virtual _",
    "observer , which communicates with the access module , central database and executes ( observer ) programs .",
    "this is a tcl language - based simulation of near - perfect observer , modeled as a finite - state machine , which makes decisions / transitions depending on the circumstances .",
    "the observer programs ( such as taking flatfield frames and all - sky monitoring ) are run as independent threads , so the observer never hangs by waiting for a time - consuming operation to finish ; it can be aborted any time .",
    "tasks have start times ( relative to sunset ) , allowed durations and priorities  both taken from the db , whose properties are used by a task - manager ( part of the observer ) to launch or stop them and to suspend or interrupt other tasks .",
    "there is a template , which makes writing new tasks very simple for the user , using a command library of a few hundred commands , such as `` observeobject '' .    during normal operation ,",
    "the observer is in `` run '' state .",
    "if the weather is unfavorable , the observer passes to a `` weather sleep '' state , where the ccd is kept cooled , the dome is closed , and the system waits for clearing . in the daytime",
    "the system is in `` daysleep '' , power is turned off , ccd is warmed back , and we are waiting for the first scheduled task to appear within the characteristic time needed for starting up . if the internet connection with the monitoring stations is lost , system jumps to `` suspend '' state , turns off power , and waits a long time before finally exiting to `` service '' state .",
    "recovery from service is possible only by manually restarting the system .    upon entering the `` run '' state",
    ", observer checks the tasks to be executed during the given session , checks weather information , and if needed , starts up the system ( turns power on , starts cooling the ccd ) . following this",
    ", it enters an endless cycle , and breaks out only in case of transition to another state . during the cycle it responds to direct tcp / ip messages from outside , and checks if connection with the access module and outside - connection monitor is alive .",
    "the ephemerides are continuously updated , such as apparent position of the sun and moon .",
    "the task manager launches , checks or stops tasks , administrates changes in the db .",
    "if a task exits abnormally , perhaps due to some kind of exception ( programming error ) , it is flagged , and not launched again any more .",
    "proper scheduling of tasks is one of most complex part in the code .",
    "the weather status is checked every @xmath70 , and if needed , the current task is aborted , and the observatory transits to another state . there is a possibility of looking for targets of opportunity by parsing remote tcp / ip packets , such as the grb coordinates network ( gcn ) .",
    "the observer checks and can take action upon incoming email communication , which enables the scientist to control or monitor the observatory even from a cellphone .",
    "eventually , with a given time resolution ( @xmath71 ) , concam @xcite all - sky night - time images and infrared satellite images are downloaded and stored .",
    "these proved to be very useful later in flagging the photometric quality of a night .",
    "the observer also has the ability to recover from various emergency situations ( e.g. , disk is full , device missing ) , and notify recipients via email .",
    "automatic start up of hat is included in the booting procedure of the computer , similarly , closing the observatory in the shutdown phase . this way the service staff can easily start up / bring down the system .",
    "also , hat operations resume as the power outage ends .",
    "while highly accurate pointing of a telescope covering a 9 degree field might appear to be merely a luxury , we tried to have a general purpose design with the flexibility of upgrading the focal length , thus decreasing the field of view , which requires more precise pointing .",
    "moreover , sufficient pointing capability of even a wide field instrument can be relevant to its photometric precision .",
    "there are indications that precise aperture photometry depends on positioning the same star over the same pixels of the ccd , due to inter and intra - pixel variability @xcite , although minute displacements of the telescope also do have advantages in filtering out internal reflections due to the fast focal ratio of the instrument . due to our open - loop system , deviation of absolute",
    "pointing accumulates proportionally to the individual pointing accuracy , which has to be minimized .",
    "astrometric calibration was carried out at konkoly observatory , budapest during the summer of 2001 .",
    "we used a replica ( hat-2 ) of the mount at kitt peak , the meade pictor 416xt ccd , and a soviet `` mto '' @xmath72 , f/10 maksutov telephoto lens .",
    "the 1 m focal length and the fine , @xmath73 resolution were useful for calibration , which used the starry sky as reference grid .",
    "whenever needed , we made approximate correction for atmospheric refraction , and used guide star catalogue ( gsc ; * ? ? ? * ) for finding the astrometric solution of the frames , and coordinates of the central pixel .",
    "we distinguish between the following attributes of pointing : _ homing , tracking , absolute - pointing _ precisions and _ pointing repeatability_. in general , depending on the kind of precision , crucial factors can be the balance of the axes , ramping - up distance , maximal slewing speed , surface conditions and shape of the horseshoe , polar setting and orthogonality of the axes ( ra , dec , optical axis ) .",
    "homing precision measures how precisely can we set the mount to the home - position defined by the proximity sensors .",
    "the scatter of individual homings turned out to be @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the tracking of the system depends on adjustment of the polar axis , tracking speed ( set by the mount driver ) , and the effect of environmental changes ( e.g. , strong wind ) on the axes .",
    "the projected position of the mount s polar axis on the sky was determined from the arcs of stars from exposures with @xmath76 sidereal tracking around the pole , during which the diurnal motion of the stars was negligible . as actual position of the celestial pole",
    "is known from astrometry databases , we could adjust the polar axis with @xmath77 precision .",
    "the tracking was measured in calm weather conditions on fields culminating near zenith , from hour angle @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "tracking speed was adjusted and then kept fixed in such a way that tracking residuals were minimal .",
    "the overall tracking error during 2 hours was less than @xmath80 in ra .",
    "we also found quasi - periodic errors with @xmath81 characteristic timescale and @xmath82 amplitude , which were probably due to irregularities on the small ra roller ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tracking ] ) .",
    "we defined absolute pointing precision as the precision of moving the telescope to a celestial object ( grid star ) with respect to the home position or another star ( reference star ) . pointing errors scaled with the arc of movement , but",
    "overall scatter _ without _ removing any systematic error with a correction map were in the order of @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "repeatability was measured by moving the telescope back to the reference point , usually a bright star close to zenith .",
    "repeatability is better than absolute pointing : @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "this indicates that our absolute pointing errors  at least partly  originate from non - perpendicularity of the axes and imperfect polar axis setting .",
    "hat-1 was transported ( airmail ) within its dome from budapest to steward observatory , tucson in january , 2001 .",
    "the telescope was badly damaged during the trip , but thanks to steward observatory s hospitality , it was repaired in a few weeks .",
    "the telescope was installed to steward observatory , kitt peak in the following month , and was ready for operations by march 2001 .",
    "our pc is hosted by the superlotis building s warmroom , and cables go out to the @xmath87 high , massive concrete pillar on the western edge of the ridge , holding the hat dome and telescope . the bug (  [ sec : ccd ] ) with the ap10 ccd delayed operation of hat until mid - may , but finally apogee serviced the camera .",
    "the first few month period was devoted to debugging the system and finalizing observing programs .",
    "although hat worked in robotic mode , its operation was monitored from hungary . as reliable dome status",
    "( open / close ) information is not available for any of the domes at kitt peak , we had to set aside the idea of slaving our dome opening to that of a manually operated telescope , and open / close jointly with the other dome .",
    "thus , weather status was assessed at early kitt peak evening ( 5 am central european time ) from the internet using the daytime webcamera of kitt peak , the national weather service forecast and concam images during the night .",
    "some information is automatically downloaded and parsed by hat , e.g.  we switch to `` weather - sleep '' state if the wind sensors of the 4 m mayall telescope show gusts in excess of 45 km/h .    during the debugging period we started regular observations of selected fields .",
    "the logfiles were examined next day , and updated software was transferred to the site by the next evening . this way , in a few months",
    ", the software became very reliable , and no major modifications have been performed since .",
    "since september , 2001 , hat has been operated from the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics , cambridge , ma .",
    "a typical observing session of hat is described in the following .",
    "roughly 1.5 hours before sunset , camera cooling is started , and after the service temperature is reached , 20 bias frames are taken . following this , twenty 4-minute dark frames are exposed .",
    "if weather is clear , the `` skyflat '' task starts up 10 minutes after sunset .",
    "after opening the dome , hat selects an optimal flatfield region from the database , which is close to the preferred point of minimal sky gradient @xcite .",
    "this point is usually opposite to the sun in azimuth , and @xmath88 from zenith .",
    "the telescope is randomly moved between skyflat frames so as to permit median averaging out brighter stars , and exposure time is recursively tuned to keep the central intensity at @xmath89% of saturation .",
    "even with these considerations , the twilight sky on a @xmath1 area has gradients up to 10% , and therefore we installed a domeflat screen .",
    "unfortunately this brought up further complications , and dome - flat observations are still under development . at the end of the night session ,",
    "skyflats , darks and biases are taken again .",
    "the monitoring of selected fields ( `` monfield '' ) starts when the sun sinks @xmath90 below the horizon .",
    "the entire sky was split up into 696 slightly overlapping fields , each @xmath91 wide .",
    "choosing the next field to be observed is done by a sophisticated algorithm .",
    "a list of enabled fields is loaded from the database , and visible ones with high enough elevation are selected .",
    "visibility means that the object is within the limits of the mount , above the artificial horizon - grid , and far enough from the sun and moon ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "ranking of the fields is done by combining their previous observation times ( the more recent , the lower rank ) , their proximity to the meridian or the western horizon ( depending on the ranking method ) and manually set priorities from the database . after any observation , parameters ( e.g.  time of last observation ) are updated and synchronized with the db . this ensures that none of the regions are observed too frequently until there are other , favorably situated fields .",
    "fields close to culmination , thus having the smallest possible airmass and differential refraction , are not missed .",
    "priorities of fields can be such that given their visibility , they are observed with higher frequency , or even exclusively .",
    "finally , a small random factor is appended to the ranks in order to avoid the same selection on two consecutive nights , thus daily aliases in frequency analysis .",
    "the telescope is homed every hour to keep pointing accuracy .",
    "our present observing tactic is to observe most of the visible fields sparsely , for information on long - time variation , and only concentrate on a few fields for short - term variability .",
    "the high priority is re - assigned to different fields on a weekly - monthly timescale .",
    "with two consecutive , randomly displaced 240s exposures per field , we can carry out photometry in the range of @xmath93 .",
    "we also experimented with 30s exposures so as not to lose information on very bright , saturated stars , but this increased the data flow without considerable amount of extra photometric information . with this approach",
    "we collect about 80 ( winter ) to 50 ( summer ) frame - pairs per clear night , which means approx .  30 photometric points per night and star for high priority fields ( @xmath21 photometric measurement altogether ) .    calibration of the data to standard @xmath94-band is not straightforward , as we currently observe only with a single @xmath94 filter .",
    "either hipparcos catalogue stars @xcite in our fields are used for direct calibration , or we observe landolt standards @xcite throughout the night . in both cases we have to restrict ourselves to color - independent terms : @xmath95    where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the instrumental and ( close to ) standard magnitudes , @xmath98 is the airmass , @xmath99 is the time from an arbitrary epoch @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 are coefficients to be determined by the regression .",
    "observation of landolt standards is performed by the `` standard '' task , which selects suitable standard stars ( bright enough , not extreme colors , have large airmass and hour - angle span ) , and observes the star with fine time and airmass resolution plus the culminating fields .",
    "this task is launched maximum few times a month , during absolute - photometric , new - moon nights .",
    "current data flow with lossless compression is @xmath104 ( winter ) to @xmath105 ( summer ) , thus new dat dds-3 tapes have to be inserted every week .",
    "the only unautomated procedures in hat operation are checking weather status at evening ( rain is detected automatically , but clouds not ) and tape changing .    during a year s operation hat has completed approx .",
    "@xmath106 observing sessions , with a total number of @xmath107 exposures of which 19000 were field observations , the rest were calibration frames .",
    "reduction of the current 160 gb of data is under way .",
    "photometric precision of hat-1 at kitt peak was tested using a 12-night subset of images from september / october 2001 for the moderately crowded field `` f077 '' ( @xmath108,@xmath109 ) .",
    "this contains only about 5% of our current data set .",
    "we primarily concentrate on the repeatability of the measurements , i.e. , the precision for generating light - curves ( in a system as close to @xmath94 as possible ) as compared to the _ accuracy _ , which is relative to absolute standards . our crude estimate for the latter from hipparcos i - band stars , standard star observations and",
    "the problematic flatfielding is that absolute calibration errors can be as high @xmath110 in the field corners , but less than @xmath111 in the center .",
    "a summary of the sessions is listed in table [ tab : photsum ] .",
    "observations were taken during a servicing mission , thus calibration frames are not available for all nights , and the system was not providing its maximal performance .",
    "baffle on the lens was installed only in january 2002 , and overscan region of the chip was not read out properly .",

    "`` n '' denotes the number of frames for field f077 .",
    "`` moon '' is the phase of the moon .",
    "calibration of frames was done in a standard way , and consisted of bias and dark subtraction , and flatfield correction .",
    "time - dependence of bias level was not dealt with .",
    "for some of the nights dark frames were not available , however the dark pattern seems to change in time .",
    "calibration was done by our tcl interface to iraf @xcite .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] , flatfielding with skyflat frames of a @xmath114 wide field is problematic .",
    "we tried to remove the large scale pattern ( partly due to division with flatfields not truly representing the response function of the system ) by blank - sky correction , using median average of frames taken at moonless , clear nights , close to zenith , and far from the milky way .",
    "unfortunately even these frames should be treated with caution because in some cases gradients from zodiacal light or the rippled structure of the night airglow were easily visible , and confirmed from concam images .",
    "astrometry of the master frame was performed by iraf / geomap , geoxytran , and the residuals ( offsets in arcseconds ) of the second order polynomial transformation between the celestial reference frame and the image were in the order of @xmath115 .",
    "photometry of images was finally done by the aperture photometry routine in the iraf / daophot package @xcite after experimenting with isis-2.1 image subtraction method @xcite without positive results due to our undersampling ( fwhm=@xmath116 pixel ) .",
    "the bottleneck in the latter method seemed to be spatial interpolation of the images to the reference grid , and re - sampling the narrow psfs .",
    "experiments with iraf / geotran to get around this problem did not significantly improve the results .",
    "an astrometric reference image was montaged from  20 individual frames by transforming them to the same reference grid .",
    "a starlist was established by daofind ( 60k stars ) , and later the same ids were assigned to the same stars on all frames for easy cross - identification .",
    "this astrometric reference was useful _ only _ for finding sources with good efficiency , but due to the resampling of narrow psfs during the transformation of individual images , it was not used in photometry at all .    we found roughly 30k stars per individual frame down to a threshold of 5 sigma of the background with daofind .",
    "background scatter ( @xmath117 ) almost entirely comes from the sky ( mean level @xmath118 at new moon ) and processing noise @xcite , while readout noise ( @xmath119 ) , digitization noise ( @xmath120 ) , etc .",
    ", are negligible . the raw photometric data was first transformed to the master frame in the xy - plane , stars were cross - identifed , ids were re - assigned .",
    "a reference magnitude file was created by averaging individual raw photometry measurements for a dozen good quality images .",
    "magnitudes for all frames were shifted to this reference , where the amount of the shift was spatially dependent , typically done on a @xmath121 xy - grid , and few hundred stars for each block .",
    "the residuals of the transformation indicated our photometric precision , and were in the order of @xmath122 .",
    "spatial dependence is a reasonable assumption due to the wide field - of - view and differential extinction .",
    "some fraction of the scatter is due to color - dependence of extinction , which we can not take into account .",
    "standard calibration of the field was tied to non - saturated hipparcos stars .",
    "after construction of the light - curves , we could estimate the photometric precision of the system by assuming that most of the stars are constant , and by deriving the rms of the light - curves around their mean values .",
    "most light - curves have 250 data points , and each point is the result of @xmath123 exposures .",
    "comparison with the formal error of individual points given by the photometry code ( based upon the flux of the star , the background , and various parameters ) showed that the formal error underestimates our rms with stars brighter than @xmath124 , while slightly overestimates at faint sources ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : photprec ] ) .",
    "we also derived the @xmath125 stetson variability index for each star @xcite following @xcite , where the formal errors are scaled by a linear relation to the true errors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photprec ] , lower panel ) .    stars with at least 100 data points and @xmath126 were selected as suspected variables ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "after standard fourier analysis , the selection was further narrowed by looking only at periods shorter than @xmath128 and signal detection efficiency @xcite of the main peak in the power spectrum greater than 4.5 .",
    "finally , 60 , mostly short period light - curves were selected by hand ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : multivar ] ) .",
    "we cross - correlated the list with the general catalogue of variable stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gcvs ) , including the new suspected variables ( nsv ) , and found only 12 known and 1 suspected variables .",
    "stars were also looked up in the hipparcos @xcite , tycho-2 @xcite catalogues , tycho variable stars @xcite , and the simbad database , but only one ( out of those not in the gcvs ) was found with variability flag ( gsc 0362701580 in fig.[fig : multivar ] ) .",
    "eight stars out of the suspected new discoveries were in the well - known bd , hd or sao catalogues .",
    "in addition , we retrieved all variables in our fov from the gcvs catalogue having brighter maximum than @xmath129 , not being saturated on our images , and having a period shorter than @xmath128 ( 14 entries ) .",
    "ten out of them were found by our survey , one was too crowded , and omitted from the original coordinate lists ( cz and ) , another variable was too elongated in the corner of our field , thus not found by daofind .",
    "cu and , semi - detached binary was excluded from our selection due to its small variability index ( @xmath130 ) , although it has a good quality light - curve . finally , fl lac was faint and crowded , and our light - curve was too noisy for selection .",
    "the 46 new variables are marked with their gsc numbers .",
    "several long - period variables were also found , but due to the limited time - span of our observations , we do not include them in the present paper .",
    "we described a small , autonomous observatory , which has been working for one year at steward observatory , kitt peak . in spite of the small telephoto lens used as the `` telescope ''",
    ", it can perform massive photometry of bright sources .",
    "it completed on the order of @xmath131 pointings to different objects , yielding a data flow of @xmath132 photometric measurements per night , and proved to work reliably . using 5% of our data , and a single selected field , a few dozen bright ( @xmath133 ) variables were found , further reinforcing the incompleteness even on the bright end of previous variability searches .",
    "some parameters of the system are summarized in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "hat-1 is capable of monitoring a _ small fraction _ of the sky with sufficient time resolution .",
    "multiple filters would not only ease classification of sources based upon their colors , but due to differential refraction ( vs.  color ) , the photometric precision would be also improved .",
    "wider aperture would increase the incoming flux , and either our time - resolution at constant photometric precision would drop , or our limiting magnitude with the same exposure times would be expanded .",
    "this would not be necesseraly _ improvement _ of the system , but in some sense the target of observations would be different . hat is designed to operate in a network .",
    "it is an off - the - shelf system of @xmath134 usd cost , plus the ccd .",
    "these make multiple installations easy .",
    "it is also a flexible , multi - purpose observatory , not only eligible for all - sky monitoring , but could be used as a photometric monitor station at bigger observatories .",
