    "two - photon decay in atoms and ions was introduced by max born s phd student goeppert - mayer in 1931 @xcite . since then",
    ", many aspects of such a process , like the total decay rate and the spectral distribution , have been extensively investigated in the context of few - electron atoms and ions , both in theory and experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , some interest has been also devoted to the relativistic effects on angular and polarization properties of the two emitted photons @xcite , and to electron - electron interaction effects on the total decay rate @xcite .",
    "apart from fundamental interest , two - photon transitions revealed themselves as a useful tool for investigation of different physical areas and applied science . already in 1940 , for instance , breit and teller derived that the double photon emission was the principal cause of the decay of interstellar hydrogen atoms from their metastable @xmath3-state @xcite , while , more recently , polarization properties of the emitted photons have been employed to successfully explore quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "furthermore , two - photon transitions have been proposed as a tool to measure weak interaction properties @xcite .    in this article ,",
    "the angular and polarization properties of the photon pair emitted by the two - photon decay of @xmath3 hyperfine states in hydrogenlike ions are presented .",
    "the angular and polarization analysis of the emitted light is carried out within the independent particle approximation ( ipa ) , i.e. , by coupling the spin - angular momenta of electron and nucleus and by neglecting any hyperfine interaction between electron and nucleus .",
    "this work is a first step toward exploring the effect of the nuclear angular momentum ( spin ) on the angular and polarization properties of the emitted photons .",
    "the presence of the nuclear spin has a twofold effect on the states of hydrogenlike systems .",
    "first , the energies of the atomic metastable states are slightly shifted , mainly due to the magnetic dipole interaction that nucleus and electron experience .",
    "this energy correction can be described by using first order perturbation theory with additional contributions , such as the relativistic , bohr - weisskopf , breit - rosenthal and qed contributions @xcite .",
    "since this energy correction does not influence the angular and polarization properties of the emitted radiation , it will be totally neglected in the following .",
    "second , the atomic states acquire a new quantum number , usually denoted by @xmath4 , that represents the total angular momentum of the overall nucleus plus electron system .",
    "the overall atomic state can be described by coupling the nucleus and electron angular momenta ( referred to as ipa ) , i.e by @xmath5 \\qquad { { \\displaystyle \\sum _ { m_i,\\,m_j } } } { \\langle j , m_j , i , m_i|f , m_f\\rangle } \\ket{n ; \\kappa , m_j}\\ket{\\beta ; i , m_i } ~ , \\end{array } \\label{eq : totstate1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the ( bohr ) principal , the dirac and the angular momentum quantum numbers of the electron respectively , while @xmath9 represents the nuclear spin . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the projections of the nuclear , electronic and total ( nucleus plus electron ) angular momenta onto the quantization axis , respectively . finally , @xmath13 is a collective label that denotes any other quantum number needed to specify the nuclear state apart from @xmath9 and @xmath14 . using standard notation ,",
    "@xmath15 are clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "to further proceed , we suppose that the nucleus does not interact with the radiation field . in the language of quantum mechanics",
    ", this equates to considering that the interaction hamiltonian couples only electron fields through the photon emission , while it does not act on the quantum space of nuclear states .",
    "this hypothesis holds for decays which involve bound states of neutral atoms , since the energy released in such decays is far lower than the nuclear excitation energies ( there are few exceptions to this , like the nucleus of th@xmath16 , where the first metastable excited state is @xmath17 ev above the ground state ) . for highly charged ions ,",
    "nuclear excitations are of the order of @xmath18 mev while photon energies can take values up to a hundred of kev .",
    "this supposition represents , therefore , a first approximation , since the inclusion of nuclear - field interactions in atomic decays is anyhow of higher order in perturbation theory @xcite . as a result of this assumption",
    ", we shall find in the next subsection that the radial part of the decay amplitude is characterized by only electron state components .",
    "on the other hand , we shall see that the angular part of the decay amplitude is characterized by both electron and nucleus states components , due to the coupling of their angular momenta . .",
    "the theory of two - photon decay is based on the second - order transition amplitude and has been discussed in a number of recent papers @xcite .",
    "one of the characteristic features of such amplitude is that it contains a summation over the intermediate atomic states which runs through the whole atomic spectrum , including a summation over the discrete part as well as an integration over the ( positive and negative ) continuum . for the problem under consideration ,",
    "such a summation splits up into summations over : i ) the principal quantum number @xmath19 , ii ) the dirac quantum number @xmath20 , iii ) the total angular momentum @xmath21 , and iv ) its projection onto the quantization axis @xmath22 .    by using ( [ eq :",
    "totstate1 ] ) and by taking into account the orthonormality of the nuclear states , the amplitude for two - photon transitions between hyperfine states takes the form    @xmath23^{1/2 } i^{-l_1-l_2-p_1-p_2}\\ , \\xi_{l_1\\,\\lambda_1}^{p_1 } \\xi_{l_2\\,\\lambda_2}^{p_2 } p^t \\ ; p^{t ' } \\\\[0.4 cm ] \\times\\;{\\displaystyle}d^{l_2\\,*}_{m_2\\,\\lambda_2}(\\varphi_2,\\theta_2,0)d^{l_1\\,*}_{m_1\\,\\lambda_1}(\\varphi_1,\\theta_1,0 )   \\bigg [   u^{tt'}_{\\lambda_1\\,\\lambda_2 } \\ ; \\chi_{m_i\\,m_{j_{\\nu}}}^{f^t\\ , \\nu^t } \\chi_{m_i\\,m_{j_{\\nu}}}^{\\nu^{t'}\\ , i^{t ' } }   \\;+\\ ; \\big(1\\leftrightarrow 2\\big ) \\bigg ] ~ , \\end{array }   \\label{mfi2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the helicity and wavevector of the @xmath8th photon . the term @xmath26 stands for the wigner rotation matrices of order @xmath27 with angle cordinates @xmath28 .",

    "can be well described by the familiar shape @xmath84 @xcite",
    ". however , the full - multipole calculation shows some asymmetric deviations from such a shape .",
    "this effect is already known from the past literature , where it has been showed that high multipoles contribute with terms of the type @xmath85 to the angular correlation in @xmath86 transitions in highly charged ions @xcite .",

    "the four polarization configurations ( @xmath89 ) are displayed . ]    on the other hand , for spin - flip transitions , the angular correlation within the dipole approximation is well described by the function @xmath90 .",
    "this is typical for two - photon transitions of the type j@xmath91 = 1 ( 0 ) @xmath92 j@xmath91 = 0 ( 1 ) , where j@xmath91 is the total angular momentum of the system which undergoes the decay .",
    "the two - photon decay @xmath93 in heliumlike ions , where @xmath94 is the total angular momentum of the two - electron system , shows approximately the same behavior @xcite . as in the previous case ,",
    "the full - multipole calculation shows remarkable asymmetric deviations from the symmetric shape .",
    "quantitatively , the ratio @xmath95 is @xmath96 for non - spin - flip transitions and @xmath97 for spin - flip transitions .    for low - charged ions",
    ", we find that the angular correlation is fully described by the functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 for non - spin - flip and spin - flip transitions , respectively ( i.e. , the full - multipole calculations coincides with the calculations performed within the dipole approximation ) .    from the figures",
    ", we also notice that spin - flip transitions are overall suppressed with respect to non - spin - flip transition , which is to be expected in view of the fact that the electric dipole , which is the leading multipole here , conserves the electron spin if evaluated nonrelativistically .",
    "this entails that the curves we obtained for spin - flip transitions are fully determined by relativistic and high - multipole contributions .",

    "we find that this polarization scheme holds perfectly ( i.e. , without deviations ) for low-@xmath103 hydrogenlike ions .",
    "however , for hydrogenlike uranium , as well as for any highly charged ions , sizeable deviations are evident , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .    .",
    "the energy of the emitted radiation in hydrogenlike uranium is in the range of hard x - rays .",
    "an experimental polarization analysis of such energetic photons would be nowadays possible through the use of compton polarimeters @xcite .",
    "therefore , information on the polarization state of two photons can be achieved by selecting events which have been recorded in coincidence by two polarimeters and which have the desired scattering angle @xcite .",
    "in summary , the amplitude for two - photon transitions between hyperfine states in hydrogenlike atoms has been calculated . by using such amplitude ,",
    "the angular and linear polarization properties of the photon pair emitted in two - photon decays of @xmath3 hyperfine states have been investigated within second - order perturbation theory and the dirac relativistic framework .",
