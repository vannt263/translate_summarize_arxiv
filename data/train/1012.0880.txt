    "this paper introduces _ hyperbolic geometry _ using only elementary mathematics , without any analysis , and in particular without transcendental functions .",
    "classical hyperbolic geometry , ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , is usually an advanced topic studied in the senior years of a university mathematics program , often built up from a foundation of differential geometry . in recent years , a new , simpler and completely algebraic understanding of this subject has emerged , building on the ideas of _ rational trigonometry _ ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is called _ universal hyperbolic geometry _ , because it extends the theory to more general settings , namely to arbitrary fields ( usually avoiding characteristic two ) , and because it generalizes to other quadratic forms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the basic reference is _ universal hyperbolic geometry i : trigonometry _ ( @xcite ) , which contains accurate definitions , many formulas and complete proofs , but no diagrams .",
    "this paper complements that one , providing a pictorial introduction to the subject with a minimum of formulas and no proofs , essentially relying only on planar projective geometry .",
    "the reader is encouraged to verify theorems by making explicit constructions and measurements ; aside from a single base ( null ) circle , with only a ruler one can check most of the assertions of this paper in special cases . alternatively a modern geometry program such as the geometer s sketchpad , c.a.r . , cabri , geoalgebra or cinderella illustrates the subject with a little effort .",
    "our approach extends the classical _ cayley beltrami klein _ , or _",
    ", model of hyperbolic geometry , whose underlying space is the interior of a disk , with lines being straight line segments . in our formulation",
    "we consider also the boundary of the disk , which we call the _ null circle _ , also points outside the disk , and also points at infinity .",
    "the lines are now complete lines in the sense of projective geometry , not segments , and include also _ null lines _ which are tangent to the null circle , and lines which do not meet the null circle , including the line at infinity .",
    "this orientation is familiar to classical geometers ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but it is not well - known to students because of the current dominance of the differential geometric point of view .",
    "a novel aspect of this paper is that we introduce our metrical concepts_quadrance _ , _ spread _ and _ quadrea_purely in projective terms .",
    "it means that only high school algebra suffices to set up the subject and make computations .",
    "the proofs however rely generally on computer calculations involving polynomial or rational function identities ; some may be found in ( @xcite ) , others will appear elsewhere .",
    "many of the results are illustrated with two diagrams , one illustrating the situation in the classical setting using interior points of the null circle , and another with more general points .",
    "the fundamental metrical notions of _ quadrance _ between points and _ spread _ between lines are undefined when null points or null lines are involved , but most theorems involving them apply equally to points and lines interior or exterior of the null circle .",
    "the reader should be aware that in more advanced work the distinction between these two types of points and lines also becomes significant . instead of area of hyperbolic triangles , we work with a rational analog called _",
    "quadrea_.    with this algebraic approach we can develop geometry over the _",
    "rational numbers_in my view , always the most important field .",
    "the natural connections between geometry and number theory are then not suppressed , but enrich both subjects . later in the series",
    "we will also illustrate hyperbolic geometry over _ finite fields , _ in the direction of @xcite and @xcite , where _ counting _ becomes important .",
    "hyperbolic geometry may be visualized as the geometry of the projective plane , augmented by a distinguished circle @xmath0 ( in fact a more general conic may also be used ) . since projective geometry is not these days as familiar as it was in former times , we begin by reviewing some of the basic notions .",
    "the starting point is the affine plane ",
    "familiar from euclidean geometry and cartesian coordinate geometry  containing the usual points @xmath1   $ ] and ( straight ) lines with equations @xmath2 .",
    "the affine plane is augmented by introducing a _ new point _ for every family of parallel lines . in this introductory section",
    "we use _ _  parallel _ _ in the usual sense of euclidean geometry , so that the lines with equations @xmath3 and @xmath4 are parallel precisely when @xmath5 later on we will see that there is a different , hyperbolic meaning of ` parallel ' ( which is different from the usage in classical hyperbolic geometry ! ) the new point , one for each family of parallel lines , is a ` _ _ point at infinity _ _ ' .",
    "we also introduce one _ new line _ , the  _ line at infinity _ , which passes through every point at infinity .",
    "algebraically the projective plane may be defined without reference to the euclidean plane , with points specified by homogeneous coordinates , or proportions , of the form @xmath6   $ ] .",
    "points @xmath7   $ ] correspond to the affine plane , and points at infinity are of the form @xmath8   $ ] .",
    "the lines also are specified by homogeneous coordinates , now of the form @xmath9 , with the pairing between the point @xmath6   $ ] and the line @xmath10 given by@xmath11    this particular relation is the characterizing equation for hyperbolic geometry ; for spherical / elliptic geometry a different convention between points and lines is used , where the line @xmath12 passes through the point @xmath6   $ ] precisely when @xmath13 note that we use round brackets for lines in hyperbolic geometry .    we will visualize the projective plane as an extension of the affine plane , with the usual property that any two distinct points @xmath14 and @xmath15 determine exactly one line which passes through them both , called the * join * of @xmath14 and @xmath16 and denoted by @xmath17 and with the _ new _ property that any two lines @xmath18 and @xmath19 determine exactly one point which lies on them both , called the * meet * of @xmath18 and @xmath20 and denoted by @xmath21    in projective geometry , the notion of parallel lines disappears , since now _ any _ two lines meet .",
    "familiar measurements , such as distance and angle , are also absent .",
    "it is really the _ geometry of the straightedge_.    despite its historical importance , intrinsic beauty and simplicity , projective geometry is these days sadly neglected in the school and university curriculum .",
    "perhaps the wider realization that it actually underpins hyperbolic geometry will lead to a renaissance of the subject !",
    "most readers will know the two basic theorems in the subject , which are illustrated in figure [ pappus and desargues ] .",
    "pappus_and_desargues.eps    _ pappus theorem _ asserts that if @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are collinear , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are collinear , then @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are collinear .",
    "_ desargues theorem _ asserts that if @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are concurrent , then @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are collinear .",
    "this is often stated in the form that if two triangles are perspective from a point , then they are also perspective from a line .    a further important notion concerns four collinear points @xmath36 and @xmath37 on a line @xmath38 in any order .",
    "suppose we choose affine coordinates on @xmath18 so that the coordinates of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively @xmath39 and @xmath40 then the * cross - ratio * is defined to be the extended number ( possibly @xmath41 ) given by the ratio of ratios : @xmath42 this is independent of the choice of affine coordinates on @xmath18 .    crossratio.eps    moreover it is also projectively invariant , meaning that if @xmath43 and @xmath44 are also collinear points on a line @xmath45 which are perspective to @xmath36 and @xmath37 from some point @xmath46 as in figure [ crossratio ] , then @xmath47 .",
    "the cross ratio is the most important invariant in projective geometry , and will be the basis of _ quadrance _ between points and _ spread _ between lines , but we give also analytic expressions for these quantities in homogeneous coordinates ; both are _ rational functions _ of the inputs . the actual values assumed by the cross - ratio depend ultimately on the field over which",
    "our geometry is based , which is in principle quite arbitrary .",
    "to start it helps to restrict our attention to the _ rational numbers _",
    ", invariably the most natural , familiar and important field .",

    "note also that these notions can be defined purely projectively once the null circle @xmath0 has been specified : interior points do not lie on null lines , while exterior points do , and interior lines pass through null points , while exterior lines do not .    for those who prefer to work with coordinates",
    ", we may choose our circle to have homogeneous equation @xmath67 or in the plane @xmath68 with coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath70 simply the unit circle @xmath71    the presence of the distinguished null circle @xmath0 has as its main consequence a _ complete duality _ between points and lines of the projective plane , in the sense that every point @xmath14 has associated to it a particular line @xmath72 and conversely .",
