    "for the sake of simplicity , let us also fix a point @xmath25 .",
    "the quasi - potential @xmath26 $ ] associated with @xmath27 is then defined as @xmath28 , where the infimum is carried over all the @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 . a natural choice for the reference point @xmath32 should be an attractive point for the minima of the functionals @xmath33 ( see e.g.  theorem  [ t : conve ] and theorem  [ t : infconv ] for the case of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "indeed , in such a case , the investigation of the quasi - potential is a classical subject both in dynamical optimal control theory and in large deviations theory , as it quantifies `` the cheapest cost '' to move from the stable point @xmath32 to a general one @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , from the optimal control theory point of view , the quasi - potential describes the long time limit of the functionals @xmath33 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is a broad family of stochastic processes for which the quasi - potential is expected to be the large deviations rate functional of their invariant measures , provided @xmath33 is the large deviations rate functional of the laws of such processes up to time @xmath4 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.4.1 ) for the classical finite - dimensional case , and @xcite for a more general discussion and applications to particles systems )",
    ". moreover , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) , the quasi - potential of the large deviations rate functionals provides a valuable tool to investigate long time behavior of the processes ( e.g.  average time to be waited for the process to leave an attractive point , and the path to follow when the process performs such a deviation ) .",
    "finally , in the context of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics in which the functionals @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath16 have been introduced , the quasi - potential has been proposed as a dynamical definition of the free energy functional for systems out of equilibrium @xcite .    since @xmath19 is a functional associated with a control problem ( see @xcite ) and it can be also retrieved as large deviations rate functional of some particles systems ( e.g.weakly asymmetric particle systems , see @xcite ) and stochastic pdes ( see @xcite ) , the quasi - potential problem is relevant for such a functional .",
    "similarly , @xmath20 and @xmath16 are the ( candidate ) large deviations rate functionals for both particles systems processes and stochastic pdes , see @xcite .    given a bounded measurable map , @xmath35 , it is well known that the ( entropic ) solutions to the cauchy problems for and with initial datum @xmath36 will converge to the constant @xmath37 , namely constant profiles are attractive points for the zeros of the functionals @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath16 .",
    "given @xmath38 , and two positive , smooth maps on @xmath39 , interpreted as the diffusion coefficient @xmath9 and fluctuation coefficient @xmath17 , the _ einstein entropy _ is defined as the unique nonnegative function @xmath40 on @xmath41 such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in this paper , we establish an explicit formula for the quasi - potential problem associated with the functionals @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath16 ( which of course will depend on a time parameter @xmath44 ) with reference point the constant maps on the torus , proving that these three quasi - potential functionals coincide and are equal to the integral of the einstein entropy .",
    "more precisely , given @xmath45 , the quasi - potential @xmath46 of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath16 with reference constant @xmath38 is equal to @xmath47 if @xmath48 and it is @xmath21 otherwise ( see theorem  [ t : quasipot ] ) .",
    "as remarked above , both the large deviations results in @xcite and the @xmath18-limit results in @xcite are incomplete , due to little knowledge of structure theorems and regularity results for weak solutions to conservation laws .",
    "these results on the quasi - potential give therefore an additional heuristic argument supporting the actual identification of @xmath20 as the @xmath18-limit of @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , since it is easily seen that the large deviations rate functional ( in the hydrodynamical limit ) of the invariant measures of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process is also given by the integral of the einstein entropy , these results also support the conjecture that @xmath20 and @xmath16 may coincide at least in the case @xmath12 and that they are in fact the large deviations rate functional of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process .",
    "finally , we remark that the integral of the einstein entropy is expected to rule the long time behavior of well - behaving physical systems , and the result provided in this paper thus also supports the universality of the jensen and varadhan functional @xmath16 ( or in general of @xmath20 ) as a relevant universal _ entropy functional _ for asymmetric conservative , closed physical systems .",
