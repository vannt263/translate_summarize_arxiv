    "in this paper , we propose a new alternating direction implicit ( adi ) method for solving two - dimensional ( 2d ) parabolic interface problems @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a function of interests , e.g. the temperature , @xmath2 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath3 is a source . for simplicity",
    ", the domain @xmath4 is assumed to be a rectangle one , with proper boundary conditions prescribed for @xmath5 on @xmath6 . across a material interface",
    "@xmath7 separating two media @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the diffusion coefficient @xmath2 is discontinuous , while the source term @xmath3 may be even singular . physically , the solution @xmath5 on both sides of @xmath7 is related analytically via jump conditions @xmath10 = u^+ - u^- = \\phi(s , t ) ,   \\quad [ \\alpha u_n ] = \\alpha^+ \\frac{\\partial u^+}{\\partial n }   - \\alpha^- \\frac{\\partial u^-}{\\partial n }   = \\psi(s , t),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the arc - length parametrization of the interface @xmath7 , and @xmath12 the unit normal direction .",
    "the superscript , @xmath13 or @xmath14 , denotes the limiting value of a function from one side or the other of the interface .",
    "we note that ( [ jump ] ) takes a quite general form , while for many applications , we have simply @xmath15 .",
    "the parabolic interface problem governed by ( [ heat ] ) and ( [ jump ] ) appears in many physical and engineering applications , such as the continuous casting in the metallurgical industry , the freezing process of perishable foodstuffs in the food engineering , and the magnetic fluid hyperthermia treatment of cancer .",
    "the analysis of conductive heat transfer process over composite media is indispensable in these applications .",
    "since the physical solution is non - smooth or even discontinuous across the interface , the standard numerical methods often perform poorly for the parabolic interface problem . to restore the accuracy near the interface",
    ", the jump conditions ( [ jump ] ) have to be incorporated into the numerical discretization in certain manner . for finite element methods @xcite and finite volume methods @xcite ,",
    "many rigorous interface treatments have been proposed to deliver high accuracy in solving parabolic interface problems .    as one of the most successful finite difference methods for solving material interface problems , the immersed interface method ( iim )",
    "was originally introduced by leveque and li @xcite for solving elliptic equations with discontinuous coefficients and singular sources . by rigorously imposing jump conditions via local taylor expansions",
    ", the iim achieves the second order of accuracy for complex elliptic interfaces .",
    "the development of the iim for solving parabolic equations has been considered in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors constructed the iim together with the implicit euler time integration for parabolic equations with singular own sources .",
    "the iim has been applied in @xcite for solving the poisson equation over moving irregular domains or over fixed domains with the neumann boundary condition .",
    "the maximum principle preserving iim has been proposed in @xcite by adams and li for solving the convection - diffusion equation with general jump conditions . in this scheme",
    ", the advection term is discretized explicitly while the diffusion term is treated implicitly .",
    "a fast multigrid method is implemented to efficiently solve the linear system of equations for the implicit time stepping @xcite .    as one of the most successful finite difference methods for solving parabolic equations , the classical adi method @xcite can be written as some perturbations of multidimensional implicit methods , such as the crank - nicolson and backward euler . in general , the adi method is unconditionally stable for parabolic problems without interfaces so that a large time increment is admissible , which in turn can lead to a faster simulation .",
    "the major attraction of the adi method , as compared with other implicit methods , is that it reduces a multidimensional problem to sets of independent one - dimensional ( 1d ) problems of tridiagonal structures , and such matrices can be efficiently solved using the thomas algorithm @xcite . moreover",
    ", the essentially 1d feature of the adi computations allows a tremendously efficient parallelization , including on modern graphics processing units ( gpus ) @xcite . neglecting jump conditions ,",
    "the classical adi method has been applied to solve interface problems with sharp or smeared interfaces , see for example @xcite . however , for sharp interface problems , the central finite difference approximation degrades to the first order of accuracy in space and the precious unconditional stability may be lost @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is highly desired to construct novel adi methods for solving parabolic interface problems without compromising stability and spatial accuracy .",
    "the first rigorous interface treatment in the adi framework was due to li and mayo @xcite , in which a homogeneous 2d heat equation with a constant diffusion coefficient and a singular source is solved .",
    "for such an interface setting , the jump conditions ( [ jump ] ) take a simpler form with @xmath16 .",
    "thus , higher order jump conditions can be simply derived @xcite .",
    "this allows the construction of a second order accurate iim - adi method by adding some correction terms into the classical adi scheme for irregular points near the interface .",
    "considering the same jump conditions , liu and zheng have extended the iim - adi method to solve a 2d homogeneous convection - diffusion equation @xcite and a three - dimensional ( 3d ) homogeneous heat equation @xcite .",
    "however , grand difficulties are encountered when the iim - adi method @xcite is generalized in @xcite to solve a 2d heat equation with nonhomogeneous media , i.e. , @xmath2 being a piecewise constant . by still assuming simple jump conditions with prescribed function and derivative jumps ,",
    "i.e. , given @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 $ ] values , the second order jump condition for @xmath19 $ ] can not be simply derived from the governing equation now .",
    "a rather complicated second order jump condition is considered in @xcite so that the sor iterative method has to be used to solve a 2d linear system in each step of the crank - nicolson time integration .",
    "we note that , on the other hand , if the general jump conditions like ( [ jump ] ) are used , the second order jump conditions could be naturally derived .",
    "nevertheless , the construction of the iim - adi scheme through introducing correction terms remains a challenge for general jump conditions .",
    "therefore , the development of accurate and stable adi methods for the parabolic interface problem ( [ heat ] ) and ( [ jump ] ) is essentially an open problem .",
    "the objective of this paper is to propose a novel matched adi method to overcome the aforementioned difficulties for solving general parabolic interface problems .",
    "the proposed matched adi method is formulated based on our previous interface scheme , the matched interface and boundary ( mib ) method , originally developed for solving elliptic and hyperbolic interface problems @xcite .",
    "one distinction between the mib and iim is that the mib interface modeling just needs zeroth and first order jump conditions , i.e. , ( [ jump ] ) so that the difficulty associated with the second order jump conditions of the iim is simply bypassed in the mib approach .",
    "however , the mib scheme has never been applied to a parabolic interface problem before . moreover ,",
    "the existing mib scheme can not be directly utilized in the adi formulation , because the 2d mib interface treatment will couple @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions simultaneously .",
    "the most significant contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel tensor - product decomposition of jump conditions ( [ jump ] ) , which decouples 2d jump conditions into 1d ones , in the same spirit of the adi method . then , 1d mib interface treatments will be developed in space to secure a second order of accuracy .",
    "fast algebraic solvers based on the thomas algorithm will be developed to solve 1d linear systems efficiently .",
    "the stability proof of the matched adi algorithm is highly non - trivial , because the finite difference weights of the mib discretization depend on the interface geometry in an unpredictable manner . in the present study , through calculating the spectral radius ,",
    "the proposed matched adi method is numerically verified to be unconditionally stable .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] is devoted to the theory and algorithm of the proposed matched adi method .",
    "numerical tests are carried out to validate the proposed method by considering various particular forms for the jump conditions ( [ jump ] ) .",
    "finally , a conclusion ends this paper .",
    "consider an interface problem , in which @xmath8 is interior to @xmath9 .",
    "define a uniform mesh partition of the computational domain @xmath4 . without the loss of generality , we assume that the grid spacing @xmath22 in both @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions is the same and one grid line cuts the interface @xmath7 at most twice .",
    "denote the time increment to be @xmath23 and take @xmath24 and @xmath25 as the number of grid points in each direction . to facilitate the following discussions , we adopt a notation at node @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "we first rewrite the heat equation ( [ heat2 ] ) by dividing @xmath2 throughout @xmath28 if the jump conditions ( [ jump ] ) are rigorously enforced in the numerical discretization , the numerical solution to ( [ heat2 ] ) will be identical to that of ( [ heat ] ) , whereas ( [ heat2 ] ) allows an easier formulation for the adi method .",
    "the semi - discretization of ( [ heat2 ] ) using the implicit euler time integration at a general spacial node @xmath29 reads @xmath30 which is first order accurate in time . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are discrete operators for finite difference approximations in @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions .",
    "we propose a first order douglas adi method for solving ( [ heat2 ] ) , @xmath33 to see the connection between ( [ adisemi ] ) and ( [ adi ] ) , we can eliminate @xmath34 in ( [ adi ] ) , @xmath35 after fully expanding terms , eq .",
    "( [ doug2 ] ) can be written into the form @xmath36 if we drop the higher order perturbation term @xmath37 on both hand sides of ( [ doug3 ] ) , we actually obtain an equivalent form of the implicit euler scheme ( [ adisemi ] ) @xmath38 in this work , the douglas scheme ( [ adi ] ) will be employed in all adi computations , while the implicit euler scheme ( [ imeuler ] ) can be used in the theoretical analysis .",
    "we next consider the spatial discretization . for nodes away from the interface ,",
    "a central difference approximation is used , e.g. , @xmath39 in the present study , a proper dirichlet or neumann boundary condition for @xmath5 is assumed to be given on the boundary @xmath6 .",
    "such a boundary condition is implemented as in the classical adi schemes @xcite .",
    "if a nontrivial boundary condition is encountered , the advanced mib boundary closure method @xcite can be utilized to enclose such a condition into the finite difference discretization .    for nodes near the interface @xmath7",
    ", novel interface treatments will be developed to correct discrete finite difference operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 via rigorously imposing the jump conditions ( [ jump ] ) . to this end , we consider some tensor product decompositions of jump conditions ( [ jump ] ) in the adi framework . at an interface point , we denote the outer normal and tangential directions as @xmath12 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "denote the angle between @xmath12 and the @xmath20-axis as @xmath41 .",
    "coordinate transformations can be employed to convert between the derivatives @xmath42 based on ( [ jump ] ) , one more jump condition can be derived by differentiating along the interface @xmath7 : @xmath43 =   \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\tau } = \\phi_{\\tau}$ ] .",
    "we thus have three zeroth and first order jump conditions @xmath44 = \\phi , \\quad [ u_{\\tau } ] = \\phi_{\\tau } , \\quad [ \\alpha u_n ] = \\psi.\\ ] ] however , jump conditions given in ( [ jump2 ] ) can not be applied in a 1d manner in the adi algorithm .",
    "to illustrate this , we transform the flux jump condition into cartesian directions @xmath45 + \\sin \\theta [ \\alpha u_y ] = \\psi.\\ ] ] a strong coupling in @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions is clearly seen .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to decompose the 2d jump conditions ( [ jump2 ] ) into two sets of essentially 1d jump conditions .",
    "we illustrate the idea by considering the @xmath20 direction formulation",
    ". the @xmath21 direction can be similarly treated .",
    "consider an interface point @xmath46 which is the intersection point between one @xmath20 grid line and @xmath7 .",
    "if the normal direction @xmath12 at this point happens to be along the @xmath20 direction , we have simply 1d jump conditions @xmath17=\\phi$ ] and @xmath47= \\pm \\psi$ ] . for more general scenario ,",
    "in which @xmath12 is not along the @xmath20 direction , we will analytically derive a hybrid jump condition using @xmath20 and @xmath40 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath48 . by substituting this into ( [ jump - xy ] )",
    ", we arrive at @xmath49 + \\sin \\theta [ \\alpha u_{\\tau } ] = \\cos \\theta \\psi.\\ ] ] even though eq .",
    "( [ jump - xtau ] ) looks similar to eq .",
    "( [ jump - xy ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ jump - xtau ] ) allows a 1d numerical approximation , whereas eq .",
    "( [ jump - xy ] ) dose not .",
    "this is because the jump value of @xmath43 $ ] is known , while that of @xmath50 $ ] is not . in fact , eq . ( [ jump - xtau ] ) can be further rewritten as @xmath51 = \\cos \\theta \\psi - \\sin \\theta ( \\alpha^+ - \\alpha^- ) u^+_{\\tau } - \\sin \\theta",
    "\\alpha^- \\phi_{\\tau } = \\bar{\\psi},\\ ] ] where @xmath52 shall be evaluated based on finite difference approximations using grid nodes exclusively from the positive side of @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "once @xmath52 is accurately estimated , @xmath53 is known .",
    "we thus have essentially 1d jump conditions @xmath17=\\phi$ ] and @xmath47=\\bar{\\psi}$ ] .",
    "similarly , we derive the following essentially 1d jump conditions in the @xmath21 direction , @xmath54=\\phi , \\quad   [ \\alpha u_y ] = \\sin \\theta \\psi + \\cos \\theta ( \\alpha^+ - \\alpha^- ) u^+_{\\tau } + \\cos \\theta \\alpha^- \\phi_{\\tau } = \\hat{\\psi}.\\ ] ] we note that @xmath53 and @xmath55 can also be evaluated through calculating @xmath56 from the negative side of the interface .",
    "we propose a new mib scheme to impose the decomposed 1d jump conditions in the vicinity of the interface @xmath7 .",
    "comparing with other established interface methods , the mib method @xcite is ideally - suited to the present problem because in the mib , jump condition enforcement is disassociated with the derivative discretization and can be conducted in a 1d manner along each cartesian direction . here",
    ", we consider the mib modification to @xmath57 in the adi scheme ( [ adi ] ) as an example , where @xmath29 is an irregular node near the interface @xmath7 .",
    "a typical situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.grid ] ( a ) . in the mib scheme , to approximate function or its derivatives on one side of interface , one never directly refers to function values from the other side . instead",
    ", fictitious values from the other side of the interface will be supplied . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig.grid ] ( a ) , @xmath57 will be corrected as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a fictitious value at the node @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , @xmath61 will be modified .",
    "this calls for two fictitious values @xmath62 and @xmath59 , which will be resolved based on the jump conditions ( [ jump - y ] ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we finally study the spatial convergence with @xmath63 and @xmath64 . by taking @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , for the two leaves case and four leaves case , the spatial errors are reported in table [ table.ex5 ] .",
    "it can be observed that when the geometrical structure becomes more complicated or the number of leaves @xmath67 is larger , the convergence pattern of the matched adi method becomes more oscillatory and the overall numerical order becomes slightly smaller .",
    "nevertheless , the proposed matched adi method still can secure a second order of accuracy for these challenging parabolic interface problems of complicated geometry .",
    "the contour plots of the matched adi solutions based on a mesh @xmath68 at time @xmath69 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.solu5 ] .",

    "a novel tensor product decomposition is proposed to decouple 2d jump conditions into essentially 1d ones . by enforcing these 1d conditions ,",

    "the resulting matched adi scheme achieves second order of accuracy in space and first order of accuracy in time for interfaces of different shapes .",
