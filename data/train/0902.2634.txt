    "initially introduced in @xcite as a discrete approximation of langevin dynamics , the model of repeated quantum interactions has found since many applications ( quantum trajectories , stochastic control , etc . ) . in this work",
    "we generalize this model by allowing _",
    "random _ interactions at each time step .",
    "our main focus is the long - time behavior of the reduced dynamics .",
    "our viewpoint is that of quantum open systems , where a `` small '' system is in interaction with an inaccessible environment ( or an auxiliary system ) .",
    "we are interested in the reduced dynamics of the small system , which is described by the action of quantum channels .",
    "when repeating such interactions , under some mild conditions on the spectrum of the quantum channel , we show that the successive states of the small system converge to the invariant density matrix of the channel .",
    "these considerations motivated us to consider random invariant states , and we introduce a new probability measure on the set of density matrices .",
    "there exists extensive literature @xcite on what is a `` typical '' density matrix .",
    "there are two general categories of such probability measures on @xmath3 : measures that come from metrics with statistical significance and the so - called `` induced measures '' , where density matrices are obtained as partial traces of larger , random pure states .",
    "our construction from section [ sec : fixed ] falls into the second category , since our model involves an open system in interaction with a chain of `` auxiliary '' systems .",
    "next , we introduce two models of random quantum channels . in the first model ,",
    "we allow for the states of the auxiliary system to be random . in the second one ,",
    "the unitary matrices acting on the coupled system are assumed random , distributed along the haar invariant probability on the unitary group , and independent between different interactions .",
    "since the ( random ) state of the system fluctuates , almost sure convergence does not hold , and we state results in the ergodic sense .",
    "the article is structured as follows .",
    "the section [ sec : rep_int ] is devoted to presenting the model of quantum repeated interactions and its description via quantum channels .",
    "section [ sec : spectral ] contains some general facts about the spectra of completely positive maps , as well as some related tools from matrix analysis .",
    "next , in section [ sec : fixed ] we study our first model , where the interaction unitary is a fixed , deterministic matrix .",
    "we prove that , under some assumptions on the spectrum of the quantum channel , the state of the system converges to the invariant state of the channel .",
    "it is at this time that we introduce the new ensemble of random density matrices , by transporting the unitary haar measure via the application which maps a channel to its invariant state .",
    "the final two sections are devoted to introducing two models of random quantum channels , one where the interaction unitary is constant and the auxiliary states are i.i.d .",
    "density matrices ( sec . [",
    "sec : random_env ] ) and another where the interaction unitaries are independent and haar distributed ( sec .",
    "[ sec : iid_unitaries ] ) .",
    "we introduce now some notation and recall some basic facts and terminology from quantum information theory .",
    "we write @xmath4 for the set of self - adjoint @xmath5 complex matrices and @xmath3 for the set of _ density matrices _ ( or states ) , @xmath6 = 1\\}$ ] .",
    "since our main focus is quantum information , all hilbert spaces in this article are complex and finite dimensional .",
    "scalar products are assumed linear in the second coordinate and , for two vectors @xmath7 we denote by @xmath8 the map @xmath9 an unit vector @xmath10 is called a _ pure state _ and it is assimilated often with the orthogonal projection on @xmath11 , @xmath12 . finally , for a matrix @xmath13",

    "in this introductory section we give a description of the physical model we shall use in the rest of the paper : _ repeated quantum interactions_. the setting , a system interacting repeatedly with `` independent '' copies of an environment , was introduced by s. attal and y. pautrat in @xcite where it was shown that in the continuous limit ( when the time between interactions approaches zero ) , the dynamics is governed by a quantum stochastic differential equation . a different model , where after each interaction an indirect quantum measurement of the system is performed ,",
    "was considered by the second named author in @xcite and shown to converge in the limit to the so - called stochastic schrdinger equations . here ,",
    "we are concerned only with the discrete setting and with the limit of a large number of interactions .",
    "the study of random quantum trajectories is postponed to a later paper .",
    "consider a quantum system @xmath20 described by a complex hilbert space state @xmath21 .",
    "in realistic physical models , @xmath20 is usually a quantum system with relatively few degrees of freedom and it represents the object of interest of our study ; we shall refer to it as the _ small system_. consider also another quantum system @xmath22 which interacts with the initial small system @xmath20 .",
    "we shall call @xmath22 the _ environment _ and we denote by @xmath14 its hilbert state space . in this work",
    "we consider finite dimensional spaces @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we shall eventually be interested in _ repeated _ interactions between @xmath20 and independent copies of @xmath22 , but let us start with the easier task of describing a single interaction between the `` small '' system and the environment .",
    "assume that the initial state of the system is a product state @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the respective states of the small system and the environment .",
    "the coupled system undergoes an unitary evolution @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the global state after the interaction .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath28 comes from a hamiltonian @xmath30 where the operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the free hamiltonians of the systems @xmath20 and @xmath22 respectively and @xmath33 represents the interaction hamiltonian",
    ". we shall be interested in the situation where @xmath34 , otherwise there is no coupling and the system and the environment undergo separate dynamics . in this general case , the evolution unitary operator @xmath28 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the interaction time .",
    "hence , the state of the coupled system @xmath37 after one interaction is given by @xmath38 since one is interested only in the dynamics of the `` small '' system @xmath20 , after taking the partial trace we obtain the final state of @xmath20 , @xmath39.\\ ] ]    we now move on to describe successive interactions between @xmath20 and a chain of independent copies of @xmath22 . in order to do this , consider the countable tensor product @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath42-th copy of the environment ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this setting can be interpreted in two different ways : globally , as an evolution on infinite dimensional countable tensor product @xmath44 , or by discarding the environment , as a discrete evolution on @xmath45 .",
    "since we are interested only in the evolution of the `` small '' system , the latter approach is the better choice . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : single_interaction ] ) , we obtain the recurrence relation @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 are the successive states of the system @xmath20 at times @xmath48 and @xmath42 , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the interaction unitary and respectively the state of the auxiliary system @xmath22 for the @xmath42-th interaction .",
    "note that at this stage we work in a general setting , without making any assumptions on the sequences @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we introduce now a more parsimonious description of repeated quantum interactions , via quantum channels .",
    "recall that a linear map @xmath53 is called @xmath54-positive if the extended map @xmath55 is positive .",
    "@xmath56 is called _ completely positive _ if it is @xmath54-positive for all @xmath57 ( in fact @xmath58 suffices ) and _ trace preserving _ if @xmath59 = \\operatorname{tr}[x]$ ] for all @xmath60 . by definition ,",

    "since the distribution of an uniform norm - one vector @xmath249 is the equal to the distribution of @xmath254 , where @xmath255 is any fixed norm - one vector and @xmath28 is a haar unitary , @xmath252 is also the distribution of the matrix @xmath256.\\ ] ] if one chooses @xmath257 , where @xmath258 and @xmath259 are the first vectors of the canonical basis of @xmath260 and respectively @xmath261 , then @xmath262 = \\phi^{u , \\beta_0}(\\rho_0),\\ ] ] with @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",

    "now , the relation between the two families of measures is clear : the induced measure @xmath252 is the distribution of the density matrix after one interaction , whereas @xmath271 is the distribution at the limit , after a large number of interactions .",
