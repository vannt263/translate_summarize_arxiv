    "the fit yields an estimate @xmath114 for the one - dimensional dispersion of the galaxies around the space motion of the local - group barycenter .",
    "the small value of this dispersion is due to the fact that the sample galaxies reside at an average local group barycentric distance of @xmath115 , which is consistent with the local group turn - around radius ( e.g. , karachentsev et al .",
    "2002 ) , where the velocity with respect to the local group barycenter is zero by definition .",
    "when comparing the analyses in section  [ ss : los ] and the present section , there is an important difference in the expected galaxy velocities .",
    "the velocities of satellites around m31 are virialized , so the expectation value of a satellite velocity with respect to m31 is zero , independent of where the satellite is located on the sky .",
    "by contrast , the motions of the outer local - group galaxies around the local group barycenter are not virialized . therefore , the expectation value of a galaxy velocity with respect to the local group barycenter is zero only if the galaxy is near the turn - around radius .",
    "if this is not the case , then equation  ( [ matrix ] ) is valid only if the galaxies are distributed homogeneously around the local group . in reality , the distribution is both non - homogeneous and the number of galaxies is small .",
    "therefore , addition to the sample of galaxies beyond the turn - around radius is expected to add both bias and shot - noise to the estimate of the m31 velocity .",
    "moreover , galaxies significantly outside the turn - around radius do not necessarily need to follow the local group barycenter motion .",
    "the sample in table  [ t : outer ] consists of a rather small number of galaxies .",
    "so despite the aforementioned disadvantages , we did study the effect of adding more local group galaxies at larger barycentric distances .",
    "in particular , we tried to add the only other 6 local group galaxies within @xmath116 ( namely : ngc 3109 , antlia , sextans a and b , ic 5152 and kkr 25 ; grebel et al .",
    "2003 ) that are not believed to be associated with any other nearby structures .",
    "these reside at barycentric distances of 1.6@xmath117 .",
    "analysis of the combined sample of 11 galaxies yields for m31 : @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "the fit yields an estimate @xmath121 for the one - dimensional dispersion of the galaxies around the space motion of the local - group barycenter .",
    "the large deviation of @xmath20 from the observed value as well as the increased @xmath16 and formal errors support our assertion that adding these distant galaxies decreases the quality of the results .",
    "nonetheless , the results for @xmath122 and @xmath123 are consistent with those inferred from the smaller sample , within the errors .",
    "so we conclude that the results for the m31 transverse motion are quite robust , and not very sensitive to the composition of the sample .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that our results are consistent within the errors with the preferred solutions obtained by einasto & lynden - bell ( 1982 ) , despite their use of a sample that is only partially overlapping with ours .",

    "these spatial distributions are known to be inhomogeneous . in the case of the m31 subgroup",
    ", there are more satellites on the near side of m31 ( i.e. , between m31 and the milky way ) than on the far side ( e.g. , mcconnachie & irwin 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , recent studies have suggested that ( some of ) the satellites are concentrated near a plane surrounding m31 ( e.g. , koch & grebel 2006 ) .",
    "these facts by themselves do not affect our analysis at all , as long as the velocity distributions remain isotropic . however , the analysis _ would _ be affected if the satellite ensemble possessed a mean rotation .",
    "this is possible in some of the scenarios that have been suggested for a possible disk - like distribution of satellites ( but not necessarily the favored scenarios ; see , e.g. , metz , kroupa , & jerjen 2007 ) . in the method of section  [ ss : los ]",
    "we fit an apparent solid - body rotation field ( eq .  [ [ vsatlos ] ] ) to the observed satellite velocities .",
    "any intrinsic rotation would therefore bias the inferred transverse velocity .",
    "however , if this had been the case then we might have expected the m31 transverse velocity results of this method to be inconsistent with the results from the other methods that we have used , and in particular the method of section  [ ss : outerlos ] based on outer local group galaxies .",
    "the fact that the results from the different methods are actually statistically consistent therefore suggests that our results are not affected by potential rotation of the m31 satellite system .",
    "in the comparisons of the different estimates listed in table  [ t : andvel ] it should be noted that they are not completely independent , because the line - of - sight velocities of m33 and ic10 enter not only in the analysis of section  [ ss : pm ] , but also in that of section  [ ss : los ] .",
    "however , this is not a very important issue .",
    "we verified that if m33 and ic10 are removed from the line - of - sight velocity analysis in section  [ ss : los ] , then the changes in the results are well within the uncertainties .",
    "to calculate the velocity of m31 in the galactocentric rest frame we adopt the same cartesian coordinate system @xmath85 as in section  [ ss : outerlos ] .",
    "we adopt a distance @xmath132 for m31 ( holland 1998 ; joshi et al .",

    "the position of m31 is then @xmath133 . to calculate the reflex motion of the sun at the position of m31 we use the same solar velocity as in section  [ ss : outerlos ] and we use the standard iau value @xmath134 for the distance of the sun from the galactic center ( kerr & lynden - bell 1986 ) , to which we assign an uncertainty of @xmath135 ( none of our results depend sensitively on this quantity ) .",
    "the velocity of the sun then projects to @xmath136 at the position of m31 . since one",
    "observes the reflex of this , these values must be _ added _ to the observed m31 velocities to obtain its velocity in the galactocentric rest frame .",
    "the velocity vector corresponding to the observed velocity component @xmath20 given in table  [ t : satel ] and the inferred @xmath137 given in table  [ t : andvel ] is then @xmath138 . the errors ( which are correlated between the different components )",

    "the associated uncertainty can be calculated in straightforward fashion using the previously described monte - carlo scheme .",
    "this yields @xmath147 .",
    "the uncertainty is due mostly to the uncertainty in our knowledge of the circular velocity of the lsr in the galactic plane .",
    "the values of @xmath148 and @xmath149 are more difficult to interpret , because they are not unbiased estimators of the true velocities @xmath139 and @xmath150 .",
    "this is because the area coverage of @xmath139 values in the @xmath151 plane scales as @xmath152 , which produces a bias in the sense that any measurement error in @xmath151 tends to yield overestimates of @xmath139 and @xmath150 . to quantify and correct these biases we used bayes theorem , which yields the identity @xmath153 we are interested in the quantity on the left - hand side , which is the probability distribution of @xmath139 , given our measurement .",
    "the quantity @xmath154 on the right - hand side is the bayesian prior probability of @xmath139 , which we assume to be flat ( i.e. , homogeneous ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath155 is the probability of measuring a value @xmath156 if the actual value is @xmath139 .",
    "this latter distribution is easily calculated using monte - carlo drawings , because the measurement uncertainties are known .",
    "once the distributions @xmath155 have been pre - calculated for all @xmath139 , it is straightforward to obtain a monte - carlo sampling of the probability distribution @xmath157 . to this end one draws a random deviate @xmath139 , and then accepts this value with probability @xmath158 .",

    "second , there will be dynamical friction , which will tend to increase the curvature and will tend to decrease @xmath190 .",
    "more complicated calculations are necessary to properly calculate the orbit once the dark halos of the galaxies start to overlap and to study the properties of the resulting merger .",
    "such calculations were recently presented by cox & loeb ( 2007 ) .",

    "loeb et al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter l05 ) recently derived a theoretical constraint on the transverse motion of m31 from the fact that m33 is relatively undisturbed .",
    "this appears to rule out orbits where m33 had a previous close interaction with m31 .",
    "the exact shape of the region in @xmath151 space thus ruled out ( being defined by l05 as : more than 20% of the m33 stars would have been stripped ) has a complex shape and depends somewhat on the modeling assumptions , but it can be approximated by the solid cyan rectangle in figure  [ f : vwvn ] .",
    "this is an approximation to figure  2c of l05 ( which quantified the transverse motion using galactocentric rest - frame velocities @xmath208 and @xmath209 ) . in some of their models",
    "( see their figures  2a , b ) even a somewhat larger region is ruled out .    the overall shape of the excluded region in @xmath151 space can be understood with fairly simple calculations and arguments . in doing so",
    ", we ignore the observational uncertainties in the quantities of interest .",
    "this is sufficient for the scope of the present discussion , but should be included for more quantitative understanding of the m31-m33 orbit .",
    "based on the data from table  [ t : satel ] and the m33 and m31 distances from sections  [ ss : pm ] and  [ ss : orbits ] , respectively , the distance between m33 and m31 is @xmath210 .",
    "the center of the excluded region in figure  [ f : vwvn ] is at @xmath211 .",
    "this defines the three - dimensional velocity vector of m31 , while for m33 that vector is known from brunthaler et al .",
    "the radial and tangential velocity components of the separation vector are then @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "the kepler orbit of the separation vector can be calculated similarly as in section  [ ss : orbits ] . in doing so",
    ", we assume that @xmath214 , which is based on @xmath215 ( section  [ ss : orbits ] ) and @xmath216 ( compare section  [ ss : outerlos ] ) .",
    "we assume that the m33-to - m31 mass ratio is equal to the value @xmath217 suggested by the tully - fisher relation and the galaxy s circular velocities ( corbelli & schneider 1997 ; klypin et al .",
    "the orbit then has @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 .",
    "the value of @xmath185 is close to the minimum that this quantity can attain ( i.e. , maximum binding energy ) as a function of @xmath151 , which is @xmath222 .",
    "given the value of @xmath185 , m33 moves inside of the m31 dark halo for most of its orbit .",
    "our assumption that all of the m31 mass resides at its center therefore overestimates the curvature of the orbit .",
    "the listed pericenter distance should thus be interpreted as a lower bound on the actual value .",
    "more detailed calculations , as in l05 , are required to get a proper estimate of this quantity .    as one moves from @xmath223 along the diagonal that runs from the bottom left to the top right in figure  [ f : vwvn ] , the kepler orbit value of @xmath190 does nt change much .",
    "however , @xmath185 increases , which means that the orbits become more eccentric and less bound ( and ultimately unbound ) .",
    "the galaxies therefore spend less time in close vicinity of each other , and the relative velocity at pericenter increases . by contrast , as one moves from @xmath223 along the diagonal that runs from the top left to the bottom right in figure  [ f : vwvn ] , the kepler orbit value of @xmath186 does nt change much . but",
    "again , @xmath185 increases , which means that the orbits have larger pericenter separations and become less bound ( and ultimately unbound ) .",
    "the energy dissipated during an encounter scales as @xmath224 in the impulsive tidal approximation ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 , eq .",
    "[ 7 - 55 ] ) , where @xmath184 is the impact parameter . therefore ,",
    "as one moves away along either diagonal in figure  [ f : vwvn ] , the structure of m33 will be less perturbed by the encounter .",
    "the excluded region in figure  [ f : vwvn ] can therefore be understood to lowest order as the region where the orbital integral over @xmath225 exceeds some threshold , with @xmath184 and @xmath226 calculated on the basis of the kepler orbit .",
    "interestingly , the observationally implied transverse velocity of m31 from table  [ t : andvel ] falls right in the region for which considerable tidal deformation of m33 would have been expected .",
    "this m31 velocity yields a kepler orbit for the m31m33 separation vector with @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 . however , the uncertainties in the observationally implied velocities can not be ignored . upon performing monte - carlo sampling",
    "we find that as much as 18% of samplings from the error ellipse fall outside the cyan rectangle in figure  [ f : vwvn ] , and therefore do not violate the m33 tidal stripping argument .",
    "these 18% are shown as small black dots for a total sample of 30,000 drawings .",
    "the black dots can be viewed as a visual representation of the probability distribution of m31 s transverse velocity obtained by taking into account not only the observational constraints derived here , but also the theoretical m33 stripping argument of l05 .",
    "since most of the dots fall close to the cyan rectangle , it is likely that there has been some tidal deformation of m33 by m31 ( although not sufficient to pass l05 s threshold for being considered excluded ) .",
    "this suggests that it will be worthwhile to perform deep searches for tidal tails and structures in the outer regions of m33 , similar to those that have already been performed for m31 ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ) .    our results for the relative m31m33 orbit involve a small amount of circular reasoning , since we have assumed a priori that the residual space motion of m33 with respect m31 has the same dispersion ( @xmath231 per coordinate , as derived from line - of - sight velocities in section  [ ss : los ] ) as do the other m31 satellites .",
    "to avoid this circular reasoning one could ignore the result labeled `` m33 pm '' in table  [ t : andvel ] ( green cross in figure  [ f : vwvn ] ) .",
    "the weighted average of the remaining m31 transverse motion estimates then becomes @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "this differs by only @xmath234 from what we have used so far ( last line of table  [ t : andvel ] ) , and this difference is well within the uncertainties .",
    "this modified result still falls well inside the region excluded by l05 .",
    "therefore , our conclusions about the m31m33 orbit are not influenced by the fact that we have used the m33 space velocity as one of the estimators of the m31 space velocity .",
    "l05 only considered models with @xmath235@xmath236 . as is discussed in section  [ ss : mass ] below , it is possible that the m31 mass is actually lower than this .",
    "for example , klypin et al .  (",
    "2002 ) advocate @xmath237 .",
    "it follows both from the simple arguments of section  [ ss : triorbits ] and from the detailed calculations of l05 ( their figure  2 ) that the amount of past tidal deformation of m33 is smaller for smaller values of @xmath238 .",
    "this would reduce the area of the excluded rectangular region in figure  [ f : vwvn ] , and would reduce the concern that our observational estimate of the m31 transverse velocity falls in the region of parameter space that was disfavored by l05 . also , the models of l05 ( and hence the cyan region in figure  [ f : vwvn ] ) do not account explicitly for the observational uncertainties in the assumed distances of m31 and m33 .",
    "if the actual distances differ at the 1 or 2@xmath16 level from the canonical values , then this could affect the location of the excluded region in transverse - velocity space .",
    "it is straightforward to include the theoretical constraint of l05 into the m31-milky way timing argument calculations of section  [ ss : orbits ] . to address this",
    ", we applied the same monte - carlo scheme as in that section , but now with rejection of all monte - carlo drawn velocities with @xmath151 combinations in the region excluded by l05 .",
    "this yields the probability histograms shown in red in figure  [ f : hist ] .",
    "the distributions of @xmath139 , @xmath186 and @xmath190 become rather non - gaussian , as can be easily understood from the distribution of points in figure  [ f : vwvn ] .",
    "however , the other distributions remain close to gaussian , and are not very different from those obtained without using the lo5 m33 stripping argument .",
    "the same is true for the inferred @xmath4 confidence intervals around the median values .",
    "for example , for the local group mass we obtain @xmath239 , which is similar to the result of section  [ ss : orbits ] .",
    "many previous studies of the m31milky way system have assumed that their orbit can be approximated to be radial ( @xmath240 ) .",
    "this simplifies analyses based on the timing argument and , in the absence of a reliable @xmath139 measurement , was a reasonable guess based on simple cosmological arguments . in the absence of mutual gravitational interactions , peculiar velocities with respect to the hubble flow decrease with time as @xmath241 . in the m31milky way system",
    "there is mutual gravitational attraction along the galaxy separation vector .",
    "this changes the radial velocity @xmath146 from positive ( receding ) at high @xmath242 to negative ( approaching ) at the present time , as quantified by the timing argument .",
    "however , the angular momentum is conserved in a two - body system without external perturbations .",
    "therefore , a significant present - day tangential motion in such as system implies an unrealistically high peculiar velocity at high redshift .",
    "the situation is more complicated when the possibility of angular momentum exchange is taken into account .",
    "tidal torques can lead to exchange between the spin angular momentum of the galaxies and their orbital angular momentum .",
    "this process may have contributed both to the observed spins of m31 and the milky - way , and to the tangential velocity component in their orbital motion ( gott & thuan 1978 ; dunn & laflamme 1993 ) . more importantly , tidal torques exerted by the galaxies outside of the local group also induce a tangential velocity component in the m31milky way system ( raychaudhury & lynden - bell 1989 ) . a useful approach to study this effect , and more generally , the orbits of all the galaxies in the nearby universe , is based on the principle of least action ( peebles 1989 ) .",
    "this assumes that nearby galaxies arrived at their present configuration through gravitational interactions from a nearly homogeneous high - redshift state with negligible peculiar velocities .",
    "allowed solutions are those that minimize the relevant hamiltonian action integral .",
    "this method can be used to fit observed galaxy velocities starting from their observed positions ( peebles et al .",
    "1989 ; peebles 1994 ) , to fit observed galaxy distances starting from their observed velocities ( shaya , peebles , & tully 1995 ; schmoldt & saha 1998 ) , or to fit observed galaxy velocities and distances simultaneously ( peebles et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter p01 ; pasetto & chiosi 2007 ) .",
    "the general prediction from the theoretical work that includes tidal torques is that m31 tangential velocities of @xmath243 are expected in plausible models .",
    "calculated with the timing argument is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath139 .",
    "so if one pre - assumes an upper limit to @xmath6 , then one also obtains an upper limit to @xmath139 .",
    "l05 used this approach to obtain @xmath244 based on the assumption that @xmath245 .",
    "however , no physical motivation was provided for this assumed mass limit .",
    "larger values of @xmath139 are not inconsistent with the timing argument , but they do require higher masses . ]    figure  6 of p01 shows the m31 transverse velocity vectors predicted in 30 minimum - action solutions for the nearby universe .",
    "the reason that there are multiple possible solutions is due to the absence of observational knowledge of most galaxy proper motions .",
    "p01 characterized the m31 velocity using supergalactic angular coordinates in the galactocentric rest frame .",
    "these are related to the heliocentric transverse velocity @xmath18 and the position angle @xmath19 of the transverse motion on the sky , defined as in equation  ( [ vwndef ] ) , according to @xmath246 our weighted average velocity @xmath131 given in table  [ t : andvel ] corresponds to @xmath247 .",
    "the @xmath248% confidence ellipse around this measurement encloses 8 of the 30 viable solutions presented by p01 .",
    "our measurement is therefore fully consistent with their theoretical work .",
    "the action method is based on the assumptions that mass follows light and that the galaxy peculiar velocities are due to their mutual gravitational interactions .",
    "our m31 transverse motion determination therefore provides no reason to doubt these assumptions ( although cosmological n - body simulations suggest that these assumptions are at best only approximately satisfied ; martinez - vaquero , yepes , & hoffman 2007 ) .",
    "the mass @xmath249 assumed in the p01 models is @xmath250 , which is consistent with the range calculated in figure  [ f : hist ] based on the timing argument .",
    "the mass was not varied independently in p01 , but is within the factor @xmath251 range of masses for which the action method yields plausible solutions ( peebles et al .",
    "pasetto & chiosi ( 2007 ) obtained a best - fit solution from their action modeling that corresponds to a heliocentric velocity @xmath252 .",
    "this value is near the edge of our @xmath248% confidence ellipse , and is therefore also consistent with our measurement .",
    "the mass @xmath253 assumed in their models is @xmath254 , which is also within the range calculated in figure  [ f : hist ] based on the timing argument .    in summary ,",
    "our measurement of the transverse velocity of m31 is consistent with the most recent theoretical models .",
    "moreover , the fact that 73% of p01 s action - method solutions do _ not _ fall within our @xmath248% confidence ellipse suggests that our measurement has sufficient accuracy to provide meaningful constraints on the allowed solution space of the local group orbits and its history .",
    "in section  [ ss : orbits ] we calculated that the minimum @xmath255 required for a bound orbit is @xmath200 and that for a bound orbit the timing argument implies that @xmath256 .",
    "these results are based on point mass dynamics , where the point masses are proxys for entire the milky way subgroup of galaxies and the entire m31 subgroup of galaxies ( i.e. , the parent galaxy plus its satellites ) , respectively .",
    "only a negligible fraction of the light in the local group comes from galaxies that are not part of either of these subgroups ( see table  [ t : outer ] ) .",
    "therefore , the mass @xmath6 is a proxy for the total mass of the local group .",
    "it is of interest to compare our mass estimates to those derived using independent arguments .",
    "kochanek ( 1996 ) modeled the mass distribution of the milky way using equilibrium models for the velocities of milky way satellites , with the circular velocity of the disk and the escape velocity of stars in the solar neighborhood as additional constraints .",
    "this yielded a fairly well constrained mass of @xmath257 inside of @xmath258 .",
    "however , the total milky way mass depends on the extent of the dark halo , which is poorly constrained by any data .",
    "kochanek s solutions therefore allowed total masses anywhere from @xmath259 15 @xmath260 ( see his figure  7 ) .",
    "wilkinson & evans ( 1999 ) obtained a similarly large range from their models , @xmath261 , for the same reason . both of these studies used rather arbitrarily parameterized density profiles .",
    "klypin , zhao & somerville ( 2002 ; hereafter k02 ) improved this situation by restricting the discussion to models with @xmath262cdm cosmologically motivated density profiles and concentrations .",
    "this yielded a much more tightly constrained total mass .",
    "their favored solution ( their model a1 ) has a total virial mass of @xmath263 .",
    "the highest - mass model that is still consistent with the observational and theoretical constraints ( their model a4 ; see also besla et al .",
    "2007 ) has a total virial mass of @xmath264 .",
    "evans & wilkinson ( 2000 ) and evans et al .",
    "( 2000 ) modeled the mass distribution of m31 using equilibrium models for the velocities of m31 satellites and halo tracers .",
    "this yielded @xmath265 , suggesting that m31 be less massive than the milky way .",
    "however , as for the milky way modeling , the allowed mass range was large due to uncertainties in the dark halo extent .",
    "again , k02 improved this situation by imposing theoretical constraints from @xmath262cdm modeling .",
    "this yielded a favored model ( their model b1 ) with a total virial mass of @xmath266 .",
    "the ratio @xmath267 for the favored models in the k02 study ( this implies @xmath268 , as defined in section  [ ss : outerlos ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the value implied by the ratio of the galaxy s circular velocities and the tully - fisher relation , @xmath269 ( einasto & lynden - bell 1982 ) .",
    "k02 did not explore what maximum mass might still be consistent with the observational data for m31 .",
    "however , to lowest order one may guess that the situation is similar as for the milky way , where the highest allowed mass is twice the favored mass .",
    "the maximum local group mass for the k02 models is therefore @xmath270 , while the favored mass is @xmath271 .",
    "this assumes that the derived virial masses of the milky way and andromeda apply to their entire subgroups of satellites .",
    "this is reasonable , given the uncertainties already inherent in the estimates .",
    "the largest satellites of both subgroups ( the large magellanic cloud and m33 , respectively ) have @xmath272% of the luminosity of their parent galaxy , and most other satellites contribute @xmath273% .",
    "both the favored and the maximum mass of k02 exceed the value @xmath274 derived in section  [ ss : orbits ] .",
    "this suggests that the milky way and m31 are indeed a bound system , as is usually assumed .",
    "we showed that the timing argument for a bound m31milky way system implies a mass @xmath275 .",
    "this is consistent with the maximum mass allowed by the k02 models , but not with the favored mass .",
    "even the tail of the probability distribution for @xmath276 in figure  [ f : hist ] does nt go as low as @xmath277 .",
    "the best agreements are obtained for the case of nearly radial orbits and a small m31 distance .",
    "for example , @xmath278 and @xmath279 yields @xmath280 .",
    "but while this @xmath139 is consistent with our measurements , such a low distance is almost @xmath281 away from the value @xmath132 inferred using a wide range of methods ( holland 1998 ; joshi et al .",
    "2003 ; walker 2003 ; brown et al .",
    "2004 ; mcconnachie et al .",
    "2005 ; ribas et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the timing argument provides a rather simplistic view of the evolution of a binary galaxy in a cosmological context .",
    "several authors have therefore quantitatively studied its accuracy .",
    "models that address the gravitational influence and torques of structures outside of the local group have generally concluded that these do not significantly bias the mass estimates obtained from the timing argument ( raychaudhury & lynden - bell 1989 ; peebles et al .",
    "1989 , 2001 ; pasetto & chiosi 2007 ; see also section  [ ss : vtan ] ) .",
    "however , these models generally treat individual galaxies as point masses .",
    "so this does not address the fact that the galaxies themselves assemble hierarchically over time .    to include hierarchical assembly it is necessary to perform more detailed dynamical calculations .",
    "kroeker & carlberg ( 1991 ) studied the accuracy of the timing argument by examining binary galaxies found in an @xmath282-body simulation of a closed cdm universe .",
    "they found that when @xmath139 is available , the timing argument provides an unbiased estimate of the total mass ( measured in two spheres , centered on each galaxy , of radii one half the inter - galaxy separation ) . but",
    "estimates based on radial orbits yielded masses that were on average too low by a factor @xmath283 .",
    "they also found that the galaxies must be bound for the timing argument to work , since it overestimates the actual mass of unbound pairs .",
    "the independent mass estimates of the milky way and m31 discussed above suggest that the galaxies are in fact bound , so this should not be an issue here .",
    "kroeker & carlberg also show that the timing argument may not work well for pairs that are not isolated .",
    "this too should not be much of an issue for the m31milky way system , given that the sculptor , m81 , and maffei groups are all some @xmath284 away .",
    "goldberg ( 2001 ) reached somewhat different conclusions than kroeker & carlberg .",
    "he modeled binary galaxies using a perturbative least action approach in which the galaxies are part of a continuous fluid that collapses over the course of the simulation .",
    "the results were cross - validated against an n - body simulation , with consistent results . from his calculations",
    "he concluded that the timing argument tends to overestimate the total mass of a pair by a factor of @xmath285 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy between this result and that of kroeker & carlberg is unclear .",
    "however , goldberg s calculations are quite idealized , while kroeker & carlberg s calculations are now quite dated ( both in terms of numerical sophistication and underlying cosmology ) .",
    "a more modern theoretical investigation of the accuracy of timing argument was therefore presented recently by li & white ( 2008 ) .",
    "li & white identified galaxy pairs in the so - called millennium simulation with properties similar to the milky way ",
    "m31 system .",
    "the high quality and detail of this cosmological simulation provides excellent statistics , with thousands of pairs available for study .",
    "they found that the _ radial - orbit _ timing mass estimator provides an unbiased estimate of the total mass of a pair ( defined as the sum of the @xmath286 values , where @xmath286 is the mass inside the sphere over which the mean density is 200 times that of the universe at large ) . with their preferred selection cuts",
    ", they found the ratio of the true to the estimated mass to be @xmath287 , where we transformed their quoted interquartile range to a traditional gaussian dispersion .",
    "the simulations do not confirm the finding of kroeker & carlberg ( 1991 ) that the bias in the estimate depends on @xmath139 , but they do indicate that the dispersion in the estimate increases with @xmath139 .",
    "either way , the radial - orbit analysis of li & white is reasonable for the milky way  m31 system , since we have found that a radial orbit is consistent with the available observational constraints .",
    "the calculated `` theoretical uncertainty '' exceeds the uncertainties calculated here ( see figure  [ f : hist ] ) that result from propagation of observational errors .",
    "this theoretical uncertainty therefore drives the accuracy which we the local group mass is known from the timing argument . the preferred local group mass of k02 corresponds to a ratio @xmath288 .",
    "this is @xmath289 away from timing mass that we have calculated ( with @xmath16 being the quadrature sum of the theoretical and observational uncertainties ) .",
    "therefore , the two results are quite consistent . k02 quote a mass uncertainty of a factor @xmath251 , which is not too dissimilar from the timing mass uncertainty calculated by li & white ( 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , it is not a priori clear which estimate is to be preferred .      an independent mass estimate is obtained from the turn - around radius @xmath290 of the local group , defined as the distance from the local group barycenter at which galaxies have a radial velocity of zero ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1981 ) . using the same keplerian formalism as in section  [ ss : orbits ] ,",
    "galaxies on the turn - around surface have @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "equation  ( [ keplerpos ] ) therefore gives that @xmath293^{1/3 } ( 1+e ) , \\ ] ] where , as before , @xmath182 is the age of the universe and @xmath290 is usually evaluated for radial orbits ( @xmath294 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : hist ] shows the probability distribution of the predicted @xmath290 thus obtained , with @xmath6 taken from the timing argument .",
    "the inferred @xmath4 confidence interval around the median is @xmath295 .",
    "the @xmath290 predicted from the m31milky way timing argument can be compared to the observationally inferred value , @xmath296 ( e.g. , karachentsev et al .",
    "these values are not consistent . since @xmath297 ,",
    "the observed @xmath290 implies a local group mass of only @xmath298 .",
    "similar results are obtained when this method is applied to other nearby groups ( karachentsev et al .",
    "this mass is lower than that implied by the timing argument ( as stressed previously by lynden - bell 1999 ) and it is also lower than that implied by almost all studies of the individual masses of the milky way and m31 ( see section  [ ss : mass ] ) .",
    "moreover , comparison of this mass to @xmath299 from section  [ ss : orbits ] suggests that m31 and the milky way then do not form bound pair .",
    "this would make the local group little more than a chance superposition of two spiral galaxies .",
    "such a configuration has fairly low a priori probability , given the local density of spiral galaxies ( van den bergh 1971 ) .",
    "the agreement between the observed and predicted turn - around radii improves if the galaxies defining the turn - around surface are not on radial orbits .",
    "a value @xmath300 in equation  ( [ turnaround ] ) would yield perfect agreement .",
    "however , the corresponding orbits are then nearly circular and this would produce a considerable thickness in the zero - velocity surface which is inconsistent with observations ( lynden - bell 1999 ) .",
    "so a more reasonable conclusion may be that mass estimates based on the turn - around radius are systematically biased towards low values .",
    "direct evidence for this comes from the action modeling of , e.g. , peebles et al .",
    "their models reproduce both the distances and redshifts of the galaxies in the outer regions of the local group ( see table  [ t : outer ] ) , despite the use of a local group mass @xmath301 that significantly exceeds the mass implied by equation  ( [ turnaround ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the isolated collapse picture on which the concept of a turn - around surface is based may not be suitable for the local group .",
    "the underlying reason may be that the dynamical structure near the edges of the local group is significantly influenced by structures in the mass distribution on larger scales .",
    "it should also be noted that the even in idealized models the zero - velocity surface is not actually expected to be a sphere , but an elongated ellipsoid ( e.g. , figure  6 in peebles et al .  1989 ) .",
    "this is not generally taken into account in observational determinations of @xmath290 .",
    "we estimated the transverse motion of m31 under the assumption that the satellites of m31 follow the motion of m31 through space , and under the assumption that the galaxies in the outer parts of the local group follow the motion of the local group barycenter through space .",
    "the first method was applied independently to a sample of 17 satellites with known line - of - sight velocities , and to the 2 satellites m33 and ic 10 with known proper motions .",
    "the second method was applied to a sample of 5 galaxies near the local group turn - around radius ( and we showed that inclusion of 6 more distant galaxies does not significantly affect the results ) .",
    "the results from the different methods are mutually consistent and successfully recover the known line - of - sight velocity of m31 .",
    "the weighted average heliocentric transverse velocity of m31 from the different methods in the west and north directions are found to be @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "we used the known line - of - sight velocity with the newly inferred transverse velocity to determine the radial and tangential galactocentric velocity components of m31 .",
    "we used a bayesian analysis to obtain the statistical probability distribution for @xmath139 , properly corrected for observationally induced errors and biases .",
    "the results are that @xmath147 and that the probability distribution for @xmath139 has a median value of @xmath302 and a @xmath4 confidence interval @xmath303 .",
    "a purely radial orbit is consistent with the data at this confidence level .",
    "these velocities are consistent with the predictions of the most recent action - method models for the history of the local group , and have small enough errors that they can start to meaningfully constrain the full solution space allowed by these models .",
    "we used the m31 velocity vector to constrain the relative m31milky way orbit .",
    "the minimum mass required for a bound orbit is @xmath299 .",
    "if the orbit is indeed bound , then the timing argument combined with the known age of the universe implies that @xmath8 .",
    "this is consistent with mass range suggested by cosmologically motivated models for the individual structure and dynamics of m31 and the milky way , respectively .",
    "however , the timing mass is on the high end of the allowed range , with the most favored models in the study of k02 yielding a local group mass of only @xmath304 .",
    "this indicates that the m31 and the milky way are indeed bound , but that their total mass could be lower than suggested by the timing argument .",
    "li & white ( 2008 ) performed a theoretical calibration of the timing argument and found that while the timing argument mass is unbiased , it does have a theoretical dispersion of 41%",
    ". therefore , it is not statistically implausible that for the specific case of the milky way  m31 system the timing argument mass could be an overestimate by a factor of @xmath251 .",
    "the method of estimating the local group mass based on the size of the turn - around ( zero - velocity ) radius yield systematically lower masses than other methods , and is in fact not consistent with a bound nature for the m31milky way orbit .",
    "this and other arguments suggest that this method yields incorrect masses that are systematically biased low .",
    "the m31 transverse velocity implies that m33 is in a tightly bound orbit around m31 .",
    "the calculations of l05 indicate that for 82% of monte - carlo samplings from the error ellipse , more tidal deformation of m33 would have been expected than is observed .",
    "however , this assumes that @xmath235@xmath305 .",
    "the percentage is lower , and the agreement between observational and theoretical constraints on the m31 transverse velocity is better , if the m31 mass is as low as @xmath306 , as advocated by k02 .",
    "nonetheless , our results indicate that some tidal deformation of m33 could certainly have occurred .",
    "so it will be worthwhile to perform more deep searches for tidal tails and structures in the outer regions of m33 .",
    "the estimates of the local group timing mass do not change significantly if the theoretical constraints from the l05 study of m33 structure are strictly enforced .",
    "the transverse velocity inferred for m31 ( the weighted average in table  [ t : andvel ] ) corresponds to a proper motion @xmath307 and @xmath308 at a distance @xmath309",
    ". it will be difficult to obtain an actual proper motion measurement in the near future that will rival the accuracy of this . the most accurate hubble space telescope proper motion measurements for any local group galaxy ( for the large and small magellanic cloud ; kallivayalil et al .",
    "2006a , b ) have errors of 50@xmath310 .",
    "vlbi measurements of water masers can provide errors of only 5@xmath311 ( brunthaler et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "this is actually not much better than what we have already presented here .",
    "moreover , no water masers are known in m31 to which this technique can be applied and , at present detection limits , may be none should be expected ( brunthaler et al .",
    "2006 ) . therefore",
    ", a high accuracy measurement of the proper motion of m31 will have to await future generations of astrometric satellites .",
    "however , even sim or gaia measurements will at best have uncertainties that are only a few times smaller than those reported here ( see section  12 of unwin et al .",
    "2007 ) , and moreover , results are not expected from these satellites for at least another decade .    it may be possible to improve the results presented here by using a larger number of tracers of the m31 velocity .",
    "if the sample of m31 satellites with water maser proper motions can be increased from 2 to @xmath312 , then this would halve the uncertainty in the average result from the method in section  [ ss : pm ] . however , this may not be possible .",
    "water masers are often associated with regions of star formation , whereas most m31 satellites are early type dwarf ellipticals or spheroidals ( see table  [ t : satel ] ) . even in the gas - rich satellites the prospects for new water maser discoveries are not good ( brunthaler et al .",
    "therefore , the number of satellites for which water maser proper motions can be obtained is fundamentally limited .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible to increase the number of tracers at large distances from m31 for which line - of - sight velocities are available . a significant increase would be needed ( from 17 to @xmath313 ) to merely halve the uncertainties in our result from section  [ ss : los ] . while new satellites of m31 continue to be discovered on a regular basis ( e.g. , zucker et al .",
    "2007 ; ibata et al .  2007 ) , this is unlikely to significantly affect the statistics .",
    "individual red giant branch stars in the outer halo of m31 may be more promising ( e.g. , gilbert et al .  2006 ) , since it is possible , at least in principle , to obtain line - of - sight velocities for large numbers of such stars .",
