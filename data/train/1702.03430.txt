    "a similar result has been achieved by frigerio martins and salucci @xcite considering an enlarged sample of galaxies with respect to @xcite .",
    "both these results can be framed into the btf relation with the aim to show that the new fundamental gravitational radius @xmath39 can account for missing matter in galaxies .",
    "specifically , the empirical btf relation is a universal relationship between the baryonic mass of a galaxy and its rotational velocity of the form @xmath52 , which follows from the fact that luminosity @xmath53 traces baryonic mass @xmath54 through the mass - to - light ratio @xmath55 .",
    "the btf relation can be recovered from @xmath0 power - law gravity @xcite , but similar considerations can be developed for any @xmath0 gravity model . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the btf relation perfectly holds for low - surface brightness galaxies for @xmath40 = 0.817 .    before considering the general discussion of btf relation",
    ", we have to say that the gauss theorem does not hold for @xmath0 gravity because they predict the scaling of gravitational force other than @xmath56 , as it is in the newtonian case @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the gravitational field is conservative ( and irrotational ) in both cases , then the equation @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the acceleration and @xmath74 is the potential , must hold for the standard newtonian potential or other potentials derived in the newtonian limit @xcite .",
