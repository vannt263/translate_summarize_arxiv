    "both the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) and the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) occur in high - mobility two - dimensional electron systems in a quantizing magnetic field under low temperatures .",
    "although the fermi level is within the spectrum gap in both regimes , the origins of the gap are substantially different for the iqhe and fqhe .",
    "the integer quantum hall effect is explained by the landau quantization in the spectrum of the two - dimensional electron system in a magnetic field . on the contrary ,",
    "the fqhe is fully recognized as a manifestation of the electron - electron interaction . despite these differences ,",
    "charge transport is mostly determined by edge effects in both iqhe and fqhe regimes .",
    "the present report is dedicated to a detailed investigation of intra - edge transport and the differences and similarities in the physical effects observed in both regimes .",
    "halperin  @xcite introduced current - carrying edge states as the intersections of the landau levels and the fermi level near the sample edges .",
    "hence , the total number of edge states is equal to the filling factor , i.e. , the number of filled landau levels , and their electrochemical potentials are equal to the electrochemical potentials of the corresponding edges of the sample . if the number of filled landau levels is @xmath1 , the total current through the sample can be written as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the difference in the electrochemical potentials of the sample edges .",
    "hence , the current is determined only by the difference in electrochemical potentials of the edges ( or , in other words , of the edge states ) and the number of filled landau levels ( the number of edge states ) .",
    "if we introduce the edge - state current @xmath4 , then the sum of all edge - state currents gives the total current through the sample .",
    "bttiker  @xcite combined halperin s idea of current - carrying edge states with the landauer formalism  @xcite , aiming to take scattering in one - dimensional semiconductors into account .",
    "he showed that the effects of elastic and nonelastic scattering in edge states and contacts can be taken into account by introducing the transmission coefficient matrix @xmath5 .",
    "he suggested the formalism for calculating various resistances for samples with many ohmic contacts . in this formalism , the current @xmath6 carried by edge states going from a contact @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath6 is the current through edge states , going from the contact @xmath7 , @xmath9 is the electrochemical potential of the contact @xmath7 , @xmath10 is the number of edge states that are going from the contact @xmath7 .",
    "it is worth to mention here , that edge - state transport is dissipativeless in the absence of inter - edge scattering .",
    "a finite resistance is arising due to the mixing of the electrochemical potentials in ohmic contacts .       under the gate and @xmath11 in the rest of the sample .",
    "( after ref .  )",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    experimental verification of bttiker s formalism was performed mainly in the hall - bar geometry with crossing gates ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in this geometry , a sample with two current leads ( 1 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and several potential contacts ( 2 and 3 in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) was crossed by one or several gates . reducing the electron concentration under the gates to the smaller than the bulk filling factor results in a nonzero voltage between potential contacts in the quantum hall effect regime .",
    "the result can easily be explained in terms of edge states : in the absence of gate voltage , two edge states leave contact 2 and the same states arrive at contact 3 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . because no current flows through the potential contacts , their electrochemical potentials are equal , leading to zero voltage drop between contacts .",
    "if the filling factor beneath the gates is reduced , then some of the edge states are reflected at the gate boundary while the others pass through , which leads to a more complicated set of electrochemical potentials of the contacts.it can be calculated from buttiter formulas (  [ butt_form ] ) for the particular situation . moreover",
    ", this geometry allows to model and study various effects considered by bttiker .",
    "a very comprehensive review of experiments in this geometry is made in ref  @xcite .    in the region between the gates in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one of the edge states starts from beneath the gate and the other approaches the gate along the gate edge .",
    "their electrochemical potentials are different in general .",
    "further along the sample edge , the electrochemical potentials of these states come to an equilibrium due to the electron transport between them , i.e. , across the sample edge .",
    "thus , the transport effects between the edge states can be studied if the mixing of states in the contact can be excluded , i.e. , if a second crossing gate is used as a detector of the final electrochemical potential of the edge state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . using the bttiker formalism ( [ butt_form ] ) , it is easy to see that the measured resistance is @xmath12^{-1 } , \\label{mueller_form}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the phenomenological equilibration length between the edge states",
    ". it can therefore be found from the deviation in the measured resistance from the quantized value .",
    "experimental data obtained by various groups ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) have shown that the equilibration length between spin - split edge states can reach 1 mm at low temperatures and is of the order of 100  @xmath14 m for ones separated by a cyclotron splitting .",
    "this difference is caused by the fact that the spin flip accompanying the electron transfer is hampered at the edge of the sample : there are no magnetic impurities in perfect heterostructures , and the spin flip is due to the spin - orbital and hyperfine interactions  @xcite .",
    "we note that such experiments provide information about the equilibration processes only for a small imbalance ( a small difference in electrochemical potentials in comparison to the spectral gaps ) between the edge states .",
    "in fact , any initial imbalance can be applied , but to have measurable deviations from the quantized value in ( [ mueller_form ] ) , @xmath15 should be fulfilled .",
    "thus , the resulting processes are at low imbalances , between the edge states that are practically in equilibrium .",
    "the physical origin is the following : in the hall - bar geometry we study transport across the edge as the some correction to the constant transport along the edge . at high imbalances",
    "this correction is too small to be investigated .",
    "thus , hall - bar geometry is very suitable to study undisturbed situation at the sample edge . at high imbalances ,",
    "however , edge reconstruction can be anticipated , following a lot of interesting physical effects .",
    "for the investigations in this regime we should switch to the corbino topology .      ]    before describing the special features of the transport between the edge states in the case of an arbitrary imbalance , where the details of the edge structure manifest themselves , we give a detailed description of the structure of a real ( in most cases , etched or electrostatic ) edge of a sample .",
    "the edge potential is _ smooth _ smooth if it varies on a length scale much larger than the magnetic length .",
    "this is true for usual experimental realizations in the integer quantum hall effect regime , e.g. etched mesa edge or the electrostatic confinement , because of high values of the spectral gaps and the long - range character of the coulomb potential . in the case of a smooth potential ,",
    "the bottom of the two- dimensional subband rising up in approaching the edge of the sample , and the landau levels follow the subband bottom ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . at any point , a local filling factor ( the number of filled levels ) can be introduced , which varies from its initial value in the bulk of the sample to zero at the edge .",
    "a change in the local filling factor occurs each time a landau level crosses the fermi level , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , left .",
    "chklovsky et .",
    "@xcite took the electron - electron interaction into account in the mean - field approximation .",
    "it turned out that one - dimensional intersections of the fermi and landau levels are transformed into finite - width strips ( in a certain region , the landau level is ` pinned ' to the fermi level , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , right ) where the local filling factor gradually varies , and the edge of the electron system is an alternating sequence of compressible and incompressible strips of electronic liquid .",
    "the incompressible strip width is determined by the energy gap between the corresponding landau levels .",
    "the strips of compressible and incompressible electron liquid can be observed directly in spatially resolved techniques , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this case , we should answer the question about the current distribution over the sample .",
    "it was clearly showed by thouless  @xcite that dissipationless ( diamagnetic ) currents flow in regions with a potential gradient because the group velocity in such areas is nonzero .",
    "it means that they are concentrated in the incompressible strips at each sample edge .",
    "if the electrochemical potentials of the edges are different , the current in one direction exceeds the opposite current by exactly the value determined by the difference in the electrochemical potentials of the edges .",
    "this justifies the validity of the bttiker formalism , which is sensitive only to integral characteristics , such as the electrochemical potentials of the edges and the matrix of scattering coefficients ` from contact to contact . '",
    "this consideration pertains to the current along the edge of the sample .",
    "the current running across the edge and equilibration of the edge states is determined by tunnelling through incompressible strips and diffusion in compressible ones .",
    "taking these considerations into account , we can reformulate the definition of an edge state as a _",
    "compressible _ strip .",
    "this provides a clear definition for the electrochemical potential of an edge state and keeps our consideration consistent with the above considerations , where an edge state was defined as the intersection of a landau level with the fermi level .",
    "most probably , a quasi - corbino geometry in combination with the technique of a crossing gate was first proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "but the first experimental results appeared only ten years later  @xcite , when a measurement method appropriate for obtaining interpretable results was developed and the experimental difficulties arising in such measurements were overcome . by that time",
    ", the idea of applying the corbino geometry had been thoroughly forgotten , and the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite had to develop the sample geometry anew .       under the gate and @xmath16 outside the gate .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    in the quasi - corbino geometry ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , the sample has the rectangular shape with an etched region at the center , which creates two independent edges not connected topologically .",
    "ohmic contacts are made to the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at both edges a metal gate is evaporated on the top of the sample .",
    "it surrounds the internal etched area , leaving only a t - shaped region of the two - dimensional gas between the outer and inner boundaries uncovered ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    by partially depleting the 2deg under the gate , different filling factors in the t - shaped region ( @xmath17 ) and under the gate ( @xmath18 ) can be achieved , @xmath19 .",
    "some part of the edge states are reflected at the boundary of the gate and go along the gate to the other boundary of the sample . at the inner boundary of the sample not covered by the gate ( the ` bar ' of the t ) ,",
    "all edge channels are in equilibrium due to the macroscopic size and several ohmic contacts . at the outer boundary of the sample ,",
    "the area not covered by the gate ( the ` leg ' of the t ) , is of several micrometers in size .",
    "it is much less than the equilibration length at low temperatures , and there are no ohmic contacts here .",
    "thus , if a voltage is applied to a pair of contacts at the inner and outer edges , a difference in electrochemical potentials appears between the edge states at the outer edge of the sample , in the area not covered by the gate , i.e. in the gate - gap region .    to obtain @xmath0 characteristics of the transport between edge states in the gate - gap , 4-point configuration is used .",
    "current is applied between a pair of inner and outer contacts and the resulting _ dc _ voltage is measured between another pair of inner and outer contacts .",
    "( due to the existence of a preferred direction determined by the magnetic field , there are four principally different combinations of contacts . )",
    "four - point configuration allows to eliminate contact effects .",
    "the obtained results were qualitatively confirmed by direct measurements of two - terminal @xmath0 characteristics .",
    "this geometry offers many degrees of freedom to a researcher . by varying the filling factor in the gate - gap area with the help of a magnetic field",
    ", the total number of interacting edge channels can be changed ; by varying the filling factor beneath the gate with the help of the gate voltage , the channels can be divided into groups to which the difference in electrochemical potentials is applied and between which the current flows . in particular , the transport between edge states separated by a spin or cyclotron gap or , in double - layer structures , by symmetric - antisymmetric ( isospin ) splitting can be studied in the iqhe regime .      ]",
    "transformation of the @xmath0 curves was demonstrated with decreasing the temperature  @xcite . at a high temperature ( 4 k ) , the @xmath0s are linear , with the slope exactly corresponding to its equilibrium value obtained from the bttiker calculation ( [ butt_form ] ) for various combinations of ohmic contacts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this fact can be explained by the small value of the equilibration length ( compared to the size of the interaction area length , i.e. gate - gap width ) at this temperature . as the temperature decreases to 30 mk",
    ", the equilibration length grows dramatically  @xcite , and the system enters the regime of strong imbalance . the current - voltage characteristic becomes strongly nonlinear and asymmetric ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , with a pronounced threshold behavior of the right - hand branch ( corresponding to positive currents when the inner contact is grounded ) . above the threshold , this branch is linear , while the left - hand branch has no threshold and remains nonlinear .",
    "a similar transformation of the @xmath0 was observed at low temperatures  @xcite as a result of _ in situ _ varying the length of the interaction area .",
    "is equal to 2 .",
    "two spin- split energy levels reach the edge and form a structure of compressible and incompressible strips .",
    "( right panel ) the structure of the sample edge in the interaction area of edge states in the case of a voltage applied between compressible strips . at positive voltage , because the electron charge is negative , the potential barrier between the edge states reduces down to the flat - band situation ( c ) . at negative voltage",
    ", the barrier grows and deforms ( d ) .",
    "( after ref .  ) . [ fig5 ] ]",
    "the above mentioned non - linear @xmath0 curves can only be explained  @xcite by means of the smooth edge model , in which the edge is represented by alternating strips of compressible and incompressible electron liquids ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which -for simplicity- discusses the case @xmath20 ) . at bulk",
    "filling factor @xmath16 , the interaction area near the outer boundary contains two compressible strips separated by the incompressible strip with the local filling factor @xmath21 .",
    "the electrochemical potential of each compressible strip is determined by the electrochemical potential of the corresponding ( inner or outer ) ohmic contact .",
    "if a voltage is applied to a pair of contacts situated at different edges , a difference in electrochemical potentials drops within the incompressible strip between the two compressible ones and affects the distribution of edge potential in it .",
    "for instance , at positive voltages ( inner contacts grounded ) , the potential barrier between the edge states decreases and completely disappears when the voltage is equal to the corresponding spectral gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "this leads to a dramatic growth in the current at this voltage and to a complete equilibration between the edge states at larger potential differences . at negative bias voltage , the potential barrier increases , which leads to the appearance of a strongly nonlinear @xmath0 branch .",
    "thus , the energy gap between the edge states can be found from the position of the threshold voltage on the right - hand ( positive ) @xmath0 branch .",
    "it turns out that the gap is equal to the bulk value of splitting between the corresponding energy levels .",
    "this fact was first demonstrated for cyclotron gaps  @xcite , which justifies using the smooth - edge model and experimentally confirms the smoothness of an etched edge in the iqhe regime .",
    "( all the arguments for the @xmath0 should also be valid in the case of a sharp edge , but the measured gap is then much larger than the bulk value of the splitting ) . for sufficiently pure samples ,",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the gap between spin - split edge states corresponds to the bulk exchange - increased lande factor  @xcite .",
    "in addition to spectroscopic studies , the process of equilibration was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the initial values of imbalance exceeding the spectral gap in the transport between cyclotron - split edge states . in this experiment ,",
    "the slope of the linear ( above- threshold ) part of the @xmath0 right - hand branch was studied ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it turned out that for strongly nonequilibrium edge states , not the whole difference of electrochemical potentials but only the part exceeding the spectral gap can be redistributed .",
    "furthermore , the bttiker formalism  @xcite was modified by explicitly introducing a local characteristic of the transport between the edge states instead of the integral matrix @xmath5 .",
    "namely , the local transport parameter @xmath22 was defined as the ratio of the distributed difference in electrochemical potentials between the edge states and the difference in electrochemical potentials allowed for redistribution .",
    "this single parameter a is universal : it fully describes the slopes of linear parts of the @xmath0 for any combination of the contacts and depends only on the physics of the transport between edge states .",
    "numerical values of @xmath22 indicate the extent to which equilibrium is established between the edge states .       for the spin- flip transport and relaxation curves ( after ref .  ) .",
    "[ fig6 ] ]    the transport between spin - split edge states should be accompanied by the electron spin flip .",
    "the spin flip is mainly provided by the spin - orbital interaction  @xcite , but part of the electrons participate in the so - called flip - flop process : due to the hyperfine interaction , the spins of the electron and the nucleus are flipped simultaneously .",
    "this process , even at relatively high temperatures , leads to the creation of an area with a dynamic polarization of nuclear spins , in which the static polarization by the external magnetic field is inessential  @xcite .",
    "creation of dynamic nuclear polarization has been studied in the strongly nonequilibrium case in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath0s were measured for the transport between spin - split edge states in the quasi - corbino geometry . under these conditions ,",
    "the current - voltage characteristics exhibit a considerable hysteresis , especially pronounced in the left- hand ( negative ) branch ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "comparison with the @xmath0 obtained for transport without the spin flip ( through a cyclotron gap ) in the same field and with the same degree of disorder showed that the hysteresis is not related to the spurious transient effects such as recharging of the sample from the contacts .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the hysteresis is caused just by the dynamic polarization of the nuclei in the interaction area of the sample .",
    "indeed , the effective overhauser field arising in this case influences the spin splitting , which determines the potential barrier between the edge states .",
    "this affects on the current for all electrons , and not only for those whose spin flipping is caused by the flip - flop process ; as a result , a noticeable hysteresis of the @xmath0 occurs .",
    "in addition , relaxation processes investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite revealed two typical relaxation times , of the order of 25 and 200  s ( see the insets in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the first time corresponds to the creation of the dynamic nuclear polarization area at a certain stage of the transport between the edge states , and the second relates to the development of a stable area where nuclear spins in the sample are polarized due to the competition between the nuclear spin diffusion and the escape of the spins from the system .",
    "it was also demonstrated  @xcite that the flip - flop mechanism can be reversed . after establishing a local dynamic nuclear polarization region ,",
    "the externally applied current is switched off , and the sample exhibits an output voltage , which decays with a time constant typical for the nuclear spin relaxation .",
    "more complicated for investigation are tunnel - coupled double electron layers , or double - layer systems , which are usually realized in double quantum wells separated by a tunnel - transparent barrier.because of the tunnelling between the layers , the bulk spectra of such systems are already rather complicated  @xcite . at the edge of the sample ,",
    "the fermi level becomes the same for edge states that originate , in the general , from different parts of the quantum well or from subbands , depending on the quantum well symmetry .",
    "in the symmetric case , in addition to the cyclotron and spin splitting , a symmetric - antisymmetric splitting appears , which is smaller than the zeeman splitting in strong fields and exceeds it in weak fields  @xcite .. in intermediate fields , where these splitting values should be comparable , a new phase , the so - called antiferromagnetic one , appears due to the electron - electron interaction  @xcite .. a bulk transition into this phase from the range of weak fields was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite and from the range of strong fields in ref .",
    "thus , singularities can be expected in the transport between edge states in the vicinity of the bulk phase transition point .",
    "such transport singularities were observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the incompressible strip separating edge states was demonstrated to disappear near the bulk phase transition point .",
    "an important fact , established in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the structure of edge states always corresponds to the structure of the bulk spectrum and follows even its complicated transformations .",
    "it was investigated by mapping the energy gaps at the edge using @xmath0 spectroscopy , while the system approach the phase transition point .    ]",
    "the pauli principle does not forbid the intersection of edge states corresponding to different quantum numbers ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "such intersections were called defects in the topological structure of edge states , or topological defects .",
    "the possibility of the existence of such defects was shown theoretically in refs  @xcite .",
    "the only way to detect topological defects is by studying the transport between edge states , which can be most conveniently done in the quasi - corbino geometry  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a gate in this geometry , in particular , allows changing the symmetry of the quantum well , and hence the energy spectrum under the gate  @xcite .",
    "since the structure of edge states corresponds to the structure of the bulk spectrum  @xcite , the quasi - corbino geometry allows to realize topological defects in the structure of edge states  @xcite : ( i)if the well is asymmetric in the interaction area of the edge states , then edge - state electrons are fully described by the spin and isospin ( layer number ) orientations  @xcite .",
    "electrons injected from beneath the gate can also come either from an isospin - polarized state or from a mixed one . in the latter case , because the injection occurs with isospin conservation , the electrons are distributed among the edge states .",
    "this results in the intersections of edge states and in the equilibration of electrochemical potentials for all edge states in the interaction area , which manifests itself in the perfect linearity of the @xmath0 in a normal magnetic field .",
    "( ii ) if a tangential field is applied , the states in the interaction area become isospin- mixed  @xcite , and the topological defects disappear .",
    "this leads to a strongly nonlinear @xmath0 , usual for the inter - edge - state transport . in this way",
    ", the existence of topological defects and the possibility of controlling their creation and disappearance were demonstrated in ref .",
    "in the fractional quantum hall effect regime , the system has to be treated as a large number of strongly interacting particles , and therefore no method exists for exactly solving the problem with the real hamiltonian .",
    "the interaction results in a rearrangement of the ground state of the system of particles , and the new ground state can not be obtained from the perturbation theory as a small correction to the interaction- free state .",
    "two approaches turned out to be efficient for the description of such a liquid : the method of a trial ground - state wave function ( the laughlin approach  @xcite ) and the mean - field method  @xcite ( based on the hypothesis of composite fermions ) .    according to macdonald  @xcite there are collective gapless excitation modes at the sample edge in the fqhe regime , that he defined as edge states .",
    "the structure of the excitation spectrum was shown to correspond to the structure of the laughlin s ground state at the particular filling factor .",
    "for example , the state with @xmath23 , according to laughlin , is constructed as a quasi - hole state on the background of a completely filled lowest landau level . correspondingly , in this case , edge spectrum consists from the branches , originating from quasi - holes and electrons correspondingly .",
    "he attributed a current to each excitation branch @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the effective charge of the branch ( 1/3 and -1 in the above example ) and completed the construction of a fqhe bttiker formalism  @xcite by introducing the transmission matrix @xmath5 , @xcite .",
    "the so - defined edge excitations are one - dimensional and in the fqhe regime the inter - electron interaction must be consistently taken into account .",
    "this was done in the theoretical works by wen  @xcite , who applied the luttinger model  @xcite of a one - dimensional interacting liquid to this problem and demonstrated that collective excitations with a gapless spectrum do exist at the edge and their structure is indeed determined by the hierarchical structure of the bulk ground state .",
    "physically , these excitation branches correspond to different modes of edge magnetoplasmons ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite that we will need below ) .",
    "we note that an edge state in the fqhe regime is probably the only exact realization of a chiral luttinger liquid model : the edge creates the one - dimensionality of the system , the bulk states form an infinite reservoir , which is necessary in the luttinger model , and the magnetic field determines a preferred direction providing the chirality of the electron liquid .",
    "therefore , the investigation of collective excitations in the fqhe regime allows studying a rare example of a non - fermi electron liquid .",
    "since the transport along the edge is determined by the bulk filling factor and edge electrochemical potentials  @xcite , the only way to study luttinger liquid effects is the transport across the edge .",
    "wen  @xcite has shown theoretically that the tunnel density of states has power - law behavior in the fqhe regime , @xmath26 with @xmath27 for the filling factors @xmath17 from the principal laughlin sequence .",
    "it was also shown in  @xcite that there are universal scaling relations for the temperature dependence of the tunnel density of states @xmath28 .",
    "these results have also been confirmed in the approach of composite fermions  @xcite .    in the experimental study of tunnelling into the edge , it must be ensured that the @xmath0 nonlinearity is caused precisely by the excitation of collective modes and not by the deformation of the edge potential .",
    "for this , the so - called cleaved edge overgrowth technique  @xcite is used .",
    "experiments in refs  @xcite demonstrated power - law @xmath0s in the case of tunnelling into the edge , as well as temperature scaling of these diagrams with the exponents close to the predicted ones  @xcite for the filling factor @xmath29 . the experiment and the theory",
    "give considerably different results  @xcite outside the vicinity of @xmath29 , which might be caused by a structure of compressible and incompressible strips forming at the edge  @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations based on the laughlin wave function  @xcite and in the framework of the composite- fermion approach  @xcite showed that the structure of strips of an incompressible and compressible electron liquid already appears at the edge width as small as five or six magnetic lengths . in other words , all real potentials ( such as , for instance , the most common potential of a mesa etched edge ) satisfy this condition .",
    "the situation is still not so clear for the cleaved edge overgrowth ( ceo ) samples  @xcite , which are the best candidates for the sharp edge realization . on the one hand , there are signs of the compressible - incompressible strips formation in high magnetic fields  @xcite , supporting the above mentioned calculations  @xcite . on the other hand , there are sings of the sharp edge situation  @xcite in low magnetic fields , at much higher magnetic length .",
    "this difference could also occur from the progress in the ceo samples preparation over a decade . in this review",
    "we will concern only the high - field limit , as the most appropriate for the fqhe regime .    for a smooth potential , the bottom of the two- dimensional subband increases in the vicinity of the edge and the electron concentration decreases .",
    "hence , a local filling factor can be introduced , which varies from the bulk value to zero in approaching the edge of the sample .",
    "beenakker  @xcite showed that for a sufficiently pure system and the fqhe existing with such local filling factors , finite- width incompressible strips corresponding to these filling factors appear on the edge . in the fqhe regime , therefore , similarly to the iqhe case , a smooth edge consists of alternating strips of compressible and incompressible electron liquid .",
    "the difference from the integer case lies in the fact that it is now impossible to introduce a system of landau levels bent at the edge , because everything occurs on the last ( single ) landau level .",
    "it can only be asserted that there is no gap in the compressible strips , while a gap corresponding to the electrochemical potential between the ground and the excited states occurs in the incompressible strips .",
    "this gap shrinks at the edges of each incompressible strip .",
    "dissipation - free current , similarly to the iqhe case , is carried by the ground state and , because the ` excess ' current is concentrated near the edge of the incompressible area in the absence of equilibrium , it can be described as an edge current .",
    "as in the integer case , the analogue of the bttiker formalism can now be introduced as  @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath6 is the current carried by the edge states coming out of contact @xmath7 , @xmath9 is the electrochemical potential of contact @xmath7 , and @xmath31 is the maximum filling factor for incompressible strips coming from contact @xmath7 .",
    "it is easy to see that equation  [ butt_frac ] contains bttiker formula  [ butt_form ] as a special case of integer @xmath31 , as well as macdonald s result  @xcite for a sharp edge potential , because @xmath25 .",
    "this indicates that bttiker formalism is a rather general integral relation , which is independent of the details of the edge structure . similarly to the integer case , to check the formalism one should place a crossing gate on the sample .",
    "such experiments showed a perfect agreement between the calculation and the measurement  @xcite .",
    "while strips of incompressible electron liquid exist at a smooth edge of a two - dimensional electron system in the fqhe regime , collective modes appear near the boundaries of these strips  @xcite .",
    "in addition , because the edges of the strips are close ( both to each other and to the edges of neighboring strips if the potential is not very smooth ) , and the electric fields are long - range ones , these modes interact  @xcite . therefore , collective excitations on a smooth edge in the fqhe are most similar to neutral magnetoplasmon modes , which were first proposed for the iqhe regime  @xcite . as a result , in the case of tunnelling into a smooth fqhe edge , the exponent of the tunnel density of states and hence the @xmath0s become dependent on the real shape of the edge potential  @xcite , although the @xmath0 maintains its power - law behavior , which was demonstrated in ref .  @xcite .      as it was shown before , there are two major problems in investigation of collective effects at the smooth sample edge in fqhe regime : ( i ) a presence of the structure of compressible and incompressible strips , which entangle different collective modes at the strip edges ; ( ii ) deformation of the edge potential by the applied voltage @xmath32 while measuring @xmath0 curves .",
    "this affects the @xmath33 dependence , where @xmath34 is one - particle barrier transmittance , and , therefore , makes it difficult to separate one - particle effects and the collective ones .",
    "the former problem can be removed by separate contacting to compressible strips across a single incompressible one .",
    "the latter problem demands the high - imbalance regime .",
    "indeed , collective effects can be selected in two limiting cases .",
    "the first is where the bias potential is so small compared to the potential barrier that it does not deform it ( this regime was realized in ref .",
    "@xcite , but without separate contacting to the strips ) .",
    "the second case is where the bias potential is large in comparison with the barrier width .",
    "the barrier is deformed and other deformation has no effect on transport across it .",
    "( this fact can be easily understood in a triangular barrier approximation ) .",
    "we note that the second case is easier to realize from the experimental standpoint , and it can be better controlled .",
    "thus , experiments in the quasi - corbino geometry are needed to study collective effects at the smooth sample edge .",

    "further , the capacitance between the two - dimensional system and the gate should be measured while decreasing the electron concentration under the gate .",
    "this allows finding the fqhe fractional filling factors manifested in the given sample at given magnetic fields due to a decrease in the electron concentration . because approaching the edge is also accompanied by a decrease in the electron concentration for the smooth edge potential",
    ", we can be sure that incompressible strips appear at the edge of the sample at the same filling factors that were observed when decreasing the electron density beneath the gate .",
    "for example , in the sample described in ref .",
    "@xcite , at the bulk filling factor @xmath38 , incompressible strips appear in the vicinity of the edge at local filling factors @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "choosing the filling factor under the gate to coincide with one of these values , we choose the incompressible strip for which the transport is studied .",
    "similarly to the iqhe case , obtaining current - voltage characteristics is the basic tool in the study of the transport .",
    "measurement of the transport through an incompressible strip can be carried out in two ways : by fixing the current or by fixing the voltage . because the fqhe is especially sensitive to the quality of the samples and the ohmic contacts , to check the results for reliability it is necessary to see whether the data of both above - described methods of the @xmath0 measurement agree in each particular case .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to independently estimate the resistance and the quality of the ohmic contacts using magnetoresistance measurements , to use various samples and different methods to cool them , and to compare the results with the ones known for the iqhe regime .",

    "the transition probability @xmath49 can be written as the single - particle transmittance @xmath34 of the potential barrier times the tunnel density of states @xmath51 : @xmath52 .",
    "as mentioned before , the barrier can be considered triangular in the strongly nonequilibrium case , and therefore the single - particle transmittance , which can be written as @xmath53 , tends to unity when the imbalance exceeds the fractional gap @xmath54 . because the equilibration length for fractional filling factors and small imbalances are known  @xcite to be of the order of @xmath55 m , the samples used in ref .",

    "this behavior of the @xmath0s is observed for almost all fractional filling factors .     for different filling factor combinations as function of the voltage imbalance @xmath32 across the incompressible stripe with corresponding local filling factor @xmath36 ( see caption to fig .",

    "the power - law behavior of the transition probability was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .  [ fig11 ] ) ; the exponents found in experiment for the voltage and temperature dependencies differ by unity , as indeed should be the case under the excitation of collective modes  @xcite .",

    "the exponents were found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the first time and need a theoretical explanation .",
    "they are different for the filling factors @xmath42 and @xmath56 which is caused by the collective - mode excitation at the boundary of the bulk filling factor @xmath63.the edge of the @xmath63 bulk incompressible state is extremely close to the incompressible strip with local filling factor @xmath64 in this case , because of @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we can expect some influence in @xmath51 also from the edge excitations of @xmath63 bulk incompressible state , affecting the exponents in power - low @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the structure of the collective excitations is more complicated at @xmath63 , resembling the acoustic modes predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "direct measurements of the structure of edge collective excitations ( in the cases where the structure is assumed to be complicated , see ref  @xcite ) are not realistic : they would require an independent study of several simultaneously propagating magnetoplasmon modes  @xcite .",
    "but an indirect measurement method is possible . during the equilibration from an initially strongly nonequilibrium case , the transport across the incompressible strip involves excitation of collective modes  @xcite , which , in turn , establish the edge potential and therefore influence the equilibration  @xcite .",
    "such effects are not taken into account by the single - particle bttiker - beenakker theory  @xcite .",
    "hence , the comparison between the experimental equilibrium resistance and the one calculated according to bttiker s formalism ( [ butt_form],[butt_frac ] ) , can indicate a structure of the collective excitations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite equilibration was studied through incompressible strips corresponding to the local filling factors @xmath67 and 1/3 , at the bulk filling factor @xmath38 .",
    "this allows investigating equilibration at the same strip structure in the gate - gap by realizing contacts between different compressible strips .",
    "bttiker s formulas ( [ butt_form],[butt_frac ] ) yields the same equilibrium values of resistance for both combinations of filling factors . however , the experiment  @xcite showed the equilibrium resistance values to be different : for the transport through the incompressible strip with the local filling factor @xmath67 , the slope of the equilibrium curve turned out to be much smaller than the expected one , while for the transport through the strip with the filling factor @xmath64 , the measured slope was close to the expected one . in terms of bttiker",
    "s formalism , _ smaller _ equilibrium slope corresponds to an excess charge transfer across the incompressible strip , which is difficult to explain in the framework of one - particle picture . at the same time , the filling factor @xmath39 is distinguished in this experiment only by the fact that for the edges of the strip @xmath68 , a complicated structure of collective modes is expected  @xcite , and interaction between these modes determines the ` excess ' equilibration of edge states .",
    "thus , the experiment  @xcite for the first time demonstrated the existence of several branches of collective excitations at the edge of an fqhe system with the filling factor @xmath39 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the influence of collective modes on the equilibration at the edge was studied under the variation of the gate gap width .",
    "the study was aimed at transforming a strongly nonlinear current - voltage characteristic into a linear one without changing the state of the two - dimensional electron system in the sample . for this",
    ", the structure of the sample in the quasi - corbino geometry was modified : the gate - gap area was made macroscopically large . in this area ,",

    "the linearity of the central part of the curves means that the equilibration length does not exceed the interaction area size at small imbalances .",
    "based on these considerations , the equilibration length can be estimated to be 10  @xmath14 m , which is in agreement with the results in refs  @xcite obtained at small imbalances .",
    "the most unexpected result is the transformation of @xmath0s corresponding to the filling factors @xmath56 ( see fig .",

    "as the interaction area increases , the @xmath0 still remains weakly nonlinear ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) but lies below the equilibrium calculated curve , which would correspond , in terms of the beenakker - bttiker single - particle picture , to _ excessive _ charge transfer ( by more than a quarter ) .",
    "nonlinear curves for both lengths of the interaction area can be reduced to a single curve by scaling along the current axis . in this case , the scaling coefficient @xmath72 is 40 times less than the ratio of the interaction area lengths .",

    "the bttiker formalism is sensitive only to integral values , such as the electrochemical potentials of the edges and total scattering between the edge states .",
