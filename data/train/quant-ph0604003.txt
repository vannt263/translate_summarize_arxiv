    "in theory of computation it is known that the three - state element is most efficient for classical computers , but its realization remained a problem for many years .",
    "the progress was achieved in 90-ties ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "optimal number of states of the physical system for the expression mod @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is a prime , is 3 . indeed ,",
    "if we denote by @xmath1 this number , it is known that @xmath2 where @xmath3 we obtain that the function @xmath4 have the minimum when @xmath5 the necessary mathematical theory in classical many - valued logic is given in @xcite .    in the quantum world",
    "the many - level systems are ordinary ones .",
    "thus in this paper we will consider one possible version of a quantum processor based on a many - level quantum system .",
    "in @xcite the extension of the universal quantum logic to the multi - valued domain is considered , where the unit of memory is the qudit .",
    "thereby it is assumed that arbitrary unitary operators on any @xmath6-level system , where @xmath7 is any number , can be decomposed into logical gates that operate on only two levels at a time .",
    "for example , the linear ion trap quantum computer @xcite uses only two levels in each ion for computing although additional levels can be accessed , and are typically needed , for processing and reading out the state of the ion ( see @xcite and the literature cited there ) .    in the case when @xmath8 , the set of universal gates is built in the following manner .",
    "let us introduce the following unitary operators on @xmath9 @xmath10 it can be easily checked that @xmath11 and @xmath12 act on the states @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 as @xmath16 @xmath17 furthermore , the gate @xmath12 satisfies the following condition : @xmath18 @xmath19 in @xcite it is proved that the set of gates @xmath20 , g_2[z_3(c_0,c)1,c_2 ) ] \\}$ ] is universal for a three - level quantum system , where @xmath21=\\left ( \\begin{array}{cccc } i & 0 \\\\ 0&y \\end{array } \\right)$ ] and @xmath22 is the identity matrix .    below is given another approach of description of quantum system which gives the single qutrit gates , in particular , we obtain in closed form evolution operators depending on parameters .",
    "we will build the special case hamiltonian of a hydrogen - like atom moving and interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field , at that using the notations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the general form of such hamiltonian , including the center - of - mass motion and all the modes of the interacting field , is presented in @xcite . for our purposes",
    "we consider the following conditions on atom - photon interactions : ( i ) all the atom - photon interactions are the electric dipole ; ( ii ) only three atomic levels are included in the interaction ; ( iii ) two quantized resonator modes are interacting with this three - level system ; ( iv ) each of these modes interacts with only one couple of levels ; ( v ) so , from three possible couples of levels , only two of them interact directly .",
    "levels of the third couple interact only by means of an intermediate level ; ( vi ) in this work we permit , but do not consider the center - of - mass motion and large detuning from resonances , which cause the state entanglement .",
    "let us consider atom - photon interactions hamiltonian in the electric dipole approximation @xmath23 and transform it for three - level atom interacting with two modes of quantized fields of radiation .",
    "for these purposes previously we must discuss the following operators .",
    "* hamiltonian for internal degrees of freedom of non - interacting atom .",
    "* we consider internal degrees of freedom of a three - level atom .",
    "due to assumptions ( i - vi ) only two couples of energy states are involved in interaction . in all cases the intermediate state with energy @xmath24",
    "is labeled by the state vector @xmath25 . from other states , the state with higher energy",
    "is named excited , denoted @xmath26 and labeled by the state vector @xmath27 .",
    "the remaining energy level is named ground level , denoted @xmath28 and labeled by the state vector @xmath29 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "all of them are eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath30 of non - interacting three - level atom : @xmath31 using the completeness relation @xmath32 we can write the arbitrary atomic operator @xmath33 as @xmath34 utilizing ( [ 3 ] ) and the orthonormality condition @xmath35 for the hamiltonian of a three - level atom , one can easily obtain @xmath36 @xmath37 where we use ( [ 2 ] ) and above notations @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath41 thus , the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) has the following matrix form @xmath42 @xmath43    * the dipole moment operator . *",
    "now we can use the completeness relation once more to express the position operator @xmath44 in terms of energy eigenstates . as each state , wave functions @xmath45 of a free atom have definite parity , then the diagonal matrix elements equal zero @xmath46 indeed , if the function @xmath47 is symmetric and the operator @xmath48 antisymmetric , the expression under the integral sign is antisymmetric . for the nondiagonal matrix elements we have the following expressions @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the same way @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "thus , the dipole moment operator @xmath53 is expressed in the following manner @xmath54 note that this operator describes transitions from the ground state @xmath29 to the intermediate state @xmath25 , from intermediate to the excited state @xmath27 , and the process in reverse order back to @xmath29 . for verification let uss apply the operator @xmath53 ( 9 ) to the ground state @xmath55 then we get @xmath56 similarly @xmath57 and finally @xmath58 thus , the operator @xmath59 causes the atom transition from the ground to the intermediate state and can be interpreted as a creation operator for the atom in the intermediate state @xmath25 .    on the contrary , the operator @xmath60 annihilates the atom in the intermediate state and so represents the annihilation operator for the intermediate state .",
    "the operator @xmath61 causes transition of the atom from the intermediate to the excited state and can be interpreted as a creation operator for the atom in the excited state @xmath27 .",
    "the operator @xmath62 annihilates the atom in the excited state and so represents the annihilation operator for the excited state .",
    "the dipole moment operator ( [ do ] ) is defined in accordance to the expressions ( [ i1])-([i4 ] ) , of creation and annihilation operators , to be @xmath63    * the electric field operator .",
    "* now let us discuss two modes of radiation field .",
    "we assume for determinacy , that the radiation field is formed in three - mirror standing wave resonator and decompose the electric field strength in the resonator as follows @xmath64 where @xmath65 @xmath66    here @xmath67 represents the mode functions of the resonator at the position @xmath68 of the atom . @xmath69 and @xmath70 are oscillation frequencies of the field . in a classical treatment , @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xmath74 are time dependent amplitudes . in our present treatment",

    "there are two reasons for simplification of the atom - photon interactions hamiltonian ( [ ih4 ] ) @xmath107 @xmath108 namely , it amounts to confining our analysis to real transitions in which a photon is emitted while the atom goes from its upper state to its lower state , or a photon is absorbed while the atom goes from its lower state to its upper state .",
    "the second reason is mathematical and is connected with the averaging procedure  neglecting the fast oscillating terms .",
    "hereinafter we will use the interaction representation ( dirac representation ) which is defined by the internal atomic states and the free - field states and under these assumptions we may reduce the hamiltonian ( [ ih5 ] ) to the form which is called rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .    in a three - level system the simplification procedure of interaction hamiltonian should be carried out separately for each transition scheme .",
    "thus , first of all let us consider these transition schemes .",
    "in the three - level atom due to ( i)-(v ) of section 2 there are three different configurations possible for transitions between the three levels depending upon the position of the intermediate level @xmath25 . those are shown in fig . 1 along with the allowed transitions",
