    "in the last years , the existence of a supermassive black hole corresponding to the radio source sgr a * has been established on a quite solid ground @xcite .",
    "the studies of stellar dynamics in the neighborhood of sgr a * have played a major role in this scientific process providing strong evidence in favor of the existence of a huge point - like mass hidden in this radio source .",
    "the most accurate observations have been led by an american group at keck @xcite , and by a german group at vlt @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the proper motions of stars very close to the central black hole has led to a three - dimensional reconstruction of the orbits of six stars , named s2 , s12 , s14 , s1 , s8 , s13 by @xcite and s0 - 2 , s0 - 19 , s0 - 16 , s0 - 1 , s0 - 4 , s0 - 20 by @xcite , respectively .",
    "the ambiguity on the sign of the inclination was resolved for the first of these stars by doppler shift measures @xcite .",
    "then , very recently , further measurements have resolved this ambiguity also for the remaining stars @xcite .",
    "now the orbital parameters of all of them are known to an accuracy reasonable enough to start investigations relying on the knowledge of the geometric configurations between the star and the central black hole .",
    "indeed one of the most interesting effects to search for is gravitational lensing .",
    "the bending of light by gravitational fields is an invaluable instrument to investigate the properties of the lensing object , its mass distribution , the gravitational potential and many general relativistic effects .",
    "the stars around the black hole at the galactic center provide a unique lab for gravitational lensing researches , which may have very much to say in the near future on gravitational physics .",
    "the first studies of gravitational lensing by sgr a * have been performed by @xcite , who focused on sources in the stellar cluster surrounding it .",
    "they realized that gravitational lensing would slightly deplete the sky of visible stars in a region of radius 10 mas , pushing them to 30 mas .",
    "however , such a statistical effect is practically unobservable given the observed stellar density in the neighborhood of sgr a*. gravitational lensing could be recognized by identifying opposite images of a star passing behind the central black hole .",
    "several stars should be significantly lensed at a given time .",
    "estimates by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite agree that roughly 10 stars in the galactic bulge are simultaneously lensed by sgr a * with a detection threshold for the secondary image of 23 mag in the k - band .",
    "however , recognizing gravitational lensed images is by no way a trivial task . while the secondary image would stay very close to the central black hole ( at about 30 mas ) , the direct image of the source could be displaced by as much as several arcsecs .",
    "the association between the two images could be established on the basis of common spectral properties , flux variation and full correlation in their proper motions ( the lensing event should have a duration of some months ) .",
    "eventual observations of several pairs of images could pinpoint the exact position of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the secondary images could be additionally lensed by a possible population of stellar size black holes around the supermassive one @xcite , though such a double microlensing event is relatively unlikely .",
    "another possibility is to measure the shift of the apparent position of a star passing just behind the black hole @xcite .",
    "such a measurement , would provide an independent estimate of the distance of sgr a*.    coming to our six stars , we have an evident advantage : we precisely know their location in space as a function of time and thus the geometry of the lensing configuration .",
    "since we already observe the direct image , we can predict at any time where to look for a secondary lensing image and what its apparent magnitude should be .",
    "thanks to our knowledge of their orbits , we can easily predict the best time to observe these secondary images .",
    "finally , since the distances between the sources and the lens are known , the information extraction from gravitational lensing observations is much easier and unambiguous .    a very important fact",
    "that must be taken into account in the study of the light curves of gravitational lensing images is that the weak field regime for the secondary image holds only for a very good alignment between source , lens and observer .",
    "this is not the case for the six stars studied in this article .",
    "this forces us to resort to the full general relativity deflection angle formula , which is very well known since old times in terms of elliptic integrals @xcite .",
    "the deflection angle diverges logarithmically at a characteristic minimum impact angle for any class of spherically symmetric black holes @xcite , implying the existence of two infinite series of `` ghosts '' , as called by @xcite , or relativistic images , as named by @xcite .",
    "these images are due to photons winding one or more times around the black holes and are usually extremely faint .",
    "moreover , they would appear very close to the central black hole , at angular separations comparable to the apparent schwarzschild horizon , which is about 23 @xmath0as .",
    "the detection of such images would thus require a higher order technological effort , including very long baseline interferometry in the k - band and very high sensitivity . however , these images are very precious witnesses of the extreme gravitational field at distances slightly larger than the schwarzschild radius of the central black hole .",
    "the information stored in them is of striking importance to unveil the features of the true gravitational theory and the mysteries on the physics of the central black hole .",
    "relativistic images produced by sgr a * have also been studied by @xcite , who noticed that their contribution to microlensing is negligible , and by @xcite in the context of retro - lensing .",
    "s2 was the first star around sgr a * to be studied as a possible source for gravitational lensing effects @xcite .",
    "even if its orbit never allows a good alignment with sgr a * , the secondary image can reach k@xmath1 while it is in a fully relativistic regime . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we presented a complete study of s2 gravitational lensing using the tools of the strong field limit method @xcite . in this way we have been able to predict the precise epoch of the best observability of the secondary image .    in this paper",
    "we develop a complete analysis of the six aforementioned stars as potential sources for gravitational lensing by the central black hole , finding interesting results , especially for the star s14 . to cover the whole range of gravitational lensing regimes , from strong to weak",
    ", we will exclusively use the exact deflection formula known for the schwarzschild black hole . in this way we can achieve a very reliable and precise description for the light curves of all images .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in    2 we review the exact schwarzschild deflection formula and some basics of gravitational lensing . in ",
    "3 we recall the features of the six stars we want to examine , discussing the geometry of their orbits . in    4 we present the results of our analysis , with the light curves of our six stars and the positions of the secondary images . in    5 we discuss the perspectives for observations of these images using long baseline interferometry .",
    "finally ,    6 contains the conclusions .",
    "consider the generic three - point configuration between source , lens and observer , illustrated in figure [ fig lens eq ] .",
    "we indicate by @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 the distance between observer and lens , lens and source , observer and source respectively .",
    "all the distances are measured in terms of the schwarzschild radius of the black hole @xmath5    we call optical axis the line connecting the observer and the lens .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the angle between the line connecting the source to the lens and the optical axis , and by @xmath7 the angle formed by the line connecting source and observer with the optical axis .",
    "the direct image of the source suffers ( weak ) gravitational lensing only when @xmath6 is very close to zero .",
    "the secondary image is formed by photons passing behind the black hole , as shown in figure [ fig lens eq ] .",
    "the impact angles for the photons as seen from the observer and the source are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the deflection angle is defined as the angle between the asymptotic directions of motion of the photons , before and after the encounter with the black hole .    by inspection of figure [ fig lens eq ] , we can write down the following lens equation @xmath10    the impact parameter @xmath11 is related to the impact angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 by @xmath12 this relation can be used to eliminate @xmath9 in favor of @xmath8 .",
    "the position angle of the source @xmath6 runs from 0 ( perfect alignment ) to @xmath13 ( perfect anti - alignment ) .    besides the direct and the secondary image",
    ", we also have higher order relativistic images , which form closer to the central black hole .",
    "because of their potential importance as probes of very strong gravitational fields , in our analysis we will also discuss the third and the fourth order image .",
    "the third order image is formed by photons turning around the black hole and reaching the observer from the same side of the direct image .",
    "it is described by a lens equation of the type @xmath14 notice that the deflection angle @xmath15 is in the range @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the fourth order image is formed by photons performing a complete loop around the black hole and reaching the observer from the side of the secondary image .",
    "it is described by a lens equation of the type @xmath17 the required deflection angle is in the range @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the direct and the third order image have positive parity while the secondary and the fourth order ones have negative parity .",
    "the exact deflection angle was calculated by @xcite in terms of elliptic integrals .",
    "it can be written as a function of the closest approach distance @xmath19 as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is an elliptic integral of first kind .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are themselves functions of @xmath19 : @xmath25 and @xmath26    the relation between the closest approach distance @xmath19 and the impact parameter @xmath11 can be easily found by the conservation of angular momentum @xmath27    the use of the exact formula ( [ alpha exact ] ) is rather cumbersome in analytical applications .",
    "actually , before darwin s work only the weak field limit for large impact parameters was known . in schwarzschild units",
    ", it reads @xmath28    the opposite limit is recovered when @xmath11 approaches its minimum value @xmath29 . in this limit , we have @xcite @xmath30-\\pi.\\ ] ] this formula was later extended by @xcite to a generic spherically symmetric black hole and to a kerr black hole for equatorial motion @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic divergence of the deflection angle at the minimum impact parameter signals the presence of an infinite sequence of images with deflection angles which differ by a multiple of @xmath31 ( an arbitrary number of loops around the black hole ) . for impact parameters below @xmath32 ,",
    "the photon is always captured by the black hole .",
    "the striking importance of higher order images comes from the fact that they can be directly related to the values of the metric components and their derivatives close to the horizon @xcite .",
    "this provides a unique way to identify the class to which the black hole belongs , possibly giving hints on the correct gravitational theory that holds in the strong field regime .    in figure [ fig compari ]",
    ", we compare the exact deflection angle with the two approximations .",
    "we see that the weak field limit is valid only for very small deflection angles at large impact parameters , while the strong field limit starts to be accurate from @xmath33 at impact parameters very close to the minimum value . for our purpose",
    "neither of the two limits is suitable , since the secondary image demands a deflection angle in the whole range @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "our strategy is to solve the exact lens equations for the direct , the secondary , the third order and fourth order image , using the approximate solutions as starting points ( the weak field solution for the direct and the strong field ones for the others ) .",
    "we shall keep the terms @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the equations , since they are relevant in the weak field regime and in the intermediate one , though they become very small in the strong field regime , at least for the sources considered here .",
    "the magnification of an image at angle @xmath8 is given by the general formula @xmath35    the derivative can be suitably approximated by the finite difference ratio , as we do not solve the lens equation analytically .",
    "armed with these tools , once we know the absolute magnitude and the position of a star around sgr a * , we can give the position and the apparent magnitude of its four most relevant images .",
    "in the neighborhood of sgr a * , proper motion and doppler measurements have strongly increased our knowledge of stellar dynamics in this region . for six stars",
    "a complete reconstruction of the orbit has been achieved ( fig .",
    "[ fig orbite ] ) . for our analysis",
    "we shall follow the latest data published by @xcite .",
    "alternative solutions ( compatible within uncertainties ) for the orbits of these six stars , derived by different measurements and methodologies , can be found in @xcite .",
    "all these stars appear to belong to early spectral types b0-b9 @xcite , opening questions about the presence of such young stars in the inner few hundredths of a parsec around the galactic center .",
    "table 1 sums up their orbital parameters , taken from @xcite .",
    "these stars have been observed in the k - band centered on @xmath36 @xmath0 m , in which the extinction has been estimated to be 2.8 mag @xcite . in these new data",
    "all the uncertainties have been drastically reduced , save for s13 , whose orbital plane is still largely undetermined . in our analysis , we will only use the best fit values of each parameter . in the last section",
    "we will discuss how the uncertainties may affect our predictions .",
    "the schwarzschild radius of the central black hole is @xmath37 taking for its mass the value @xmath38",
    "m@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the distance of the sun from the galactic center is currently estimated to @xmath40 kpc @xcite ; then the apparent size of the event horizon is @xmath41    among our stars , the minimum distance from the central black hole is reached by s14 , which touches 110 au , still 1545 times greater than @xmath42 .",
    "hence , we can safely consider , from the gravitational lensing point of view , both the observer and the source as being infinitely distant from the lens .",
    "the case of a source orbiting very close to the lens has been examined in the context of stellar black holes by @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "from our analysis , s14 emerges as the most interesting lensing candidate , because of its small minimum distance from the black hole and because of the high inclination of its orbit , which allows good alignments and anti - alignments with sgr a*. the secondary image will reach k=23 at the next periapse epoch , which will occur around c.e .",
    "the rapid motion of this image would help to distinguish it from background sources of similar brightness , while its distortion should also be an unambiguous sign of its gravitational lensing nature with respect to fast moving stars around sgr a*. the theoretical baseline needed to resolve two sources of comparable brightness placed at an angular distance of @xmath43 mas in the k - band , amounts to @xmath44 km .",
    "however , the apparent magnitude of sgr a * is k=18.8 @xcite , which means that we have to distinguish a faint source from a 63 times brighter contaminant .",
    "this complication can be tackled by longer baselines and nulling interferometry techniques . sgr",
    "a * is still unresolved in this band .",
    "one may be worried that if its infrared flux comes from a region of several schwarzschild radii , then the secondary images of lensed stars would be merged within its diffuse infrared emission .",
    "however , current models explaining the rapid observed variability suggest that this emission takes place within 10 @xmath42 from the central black hole @xcite . in this case , the secondary image of s14 would come out of the infrared emission of sgr a * and could be resolved , in principle , by interferometry facilities .    at the present time ,",
    "the best resolution in the k - band is achieved by the keck telescope and the vlt units , the latter reaching 75 mas without interferometry , thanks to active and adaptive optics .",
    "the vlt units can be combined to perform interferometry observations with an equivalent baseline of 200 m and a maximal angular resolution of 2.2 mas ( http://www.eso.org/projects/vlti ) .",
    "a new interferometric instrument under construction is the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) , which will use two 8.4 m telescopes reaching an equivalent resolution of a 22 m telescope ( http://medusa.as.arizona.edu/lbto ) .",
    "new perspectives are opened by space telescopes .",
    "the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) will be composed by four 3.5 m telescopes working in team .",
    "the design details are still under study ; in particular , the four units may be mounted on the same structure or flying in formation several meters apart ( http://www.terrestrial-planet-finder.com ) .",
    "a similar project is darwin , which will exploit six telescopes flying in formation with an equivalent aperture of 50 meters ( http://ast.star.rl.ac.uk/darwin ) .",
    "these two missions are foreseen to launch around 2015 and are mainly aimed at exoplanet researches .",
    "the problem of resolving a faint planet from its mother - star , which is typically millions of times brighter , can be faced by the technique of nulling interferometry , which combines the signal from a number of different telescopes in such a way that the light from the central star is cancelled out , leaving the much fainter planet easier to see .",
    "of course the situation of a faint gravitational lensing image close to sgr a * has great analogies with that of exoplanets and the same techniques can be used . in order to achieve resolutions better than 0.1 mas ,",
    "we need a baseline larger than several kilometers , which must be kept stable at a very high precision .",
    "a similar problem is faced by the lisa mission in the search for gravitational waves . in this mission",
    ", three spacecraft should fly in a triangular formation at relative distances of 5 million km ( http://lisa.nasa.gov ) .",
    "finally , the maxim mission will perform x - ray interferometry with a constellation of several spacecraft and a detector kept 450 km behind the mirrors ( http://maxim.gsfc.nasa.gov ) . to accomplish formation flying with high accuracy",
    ", these missions are planning to use a laser ranging system between spacecraft and microthrusters to offset drifts .",
    "given the present situation and all the technical advances that will soon be exploited in scientific researches , 0.1 mas resolution in the k - band and the detection of secondary gravitational lensing images around sgr a * seem just the next step after the generation of telescopes currently under study .",
    "hopefully , new instruments will be available before the next periapse passage of s14 is in c.e . 2038 , to catch its secondary image .",
    "for s2 and s8 the situation is more difficult , since the peak magnitude and the angular separations of the secondary images are lower , but the numbers do not rule out the possibility of observing them with reasonable future facilities .    as regards higher order images ,",
    "s14 is still the best candidate .",
    "however , the peak magnitude of the third order image is k=32.1 , and the separation from the apparent horizon is only 0.62 @xmath0as . in order to see such a faint image so close to the event horizon we would need a complete imaging at very high resolution ( @xmath45 @xmath0as ) of sgr a*. in the k - band this seems a very difficult task .",
    "the highest resolution ever reached is 18 @xmath0as in the mm band of the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "higher resolution imaging seems to be possible at sub - mm wavelengths @xcite , though no compact radio sources ( suitable for gravitational lensing ) are known around sgr a*. finally , maxim claims that a 0.1 @xmath0as resolution is achievable in the x - ray band . in this case",
    ", one should look for suitable x - ray sources around the galactic center , which could be provided by a recently observed population of black holes within 1 pc from sgr a * @xcite .",
    "higher order images thus stand as a possible long - term target for future observations .",
    "it is really amazing that at present time it makes sense to discuss on gravitational lensing in strong fields by real physical objects .",
    "indeed , the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy with its rich stellar environment provides a unique laboratory for this research .",
    "however , this would not be enough without the great technical advances in high resolution observations of the last years , which allow us to speak about microarcsecond resolutions in sub - mm observations and possibly in higher frequency bands .",
    "the proper motion observations of stars surrounding sgr a * are progressing daily , providing more and more precise estimates for the orbital parameters . in this work ,",
    "we have analyzed six stars enjoying a good determination of their orbital parameters .",
    "our aim has been to look for observable gravitational lensing effects on these stars by the black hole in sgr a*. our investigation has considered the full set of gravitational lensing images , including weak field and relativistic ones , the latter being of striking importance for a deeper understanding of general relativity , as they provide observational tests for gravitational theories in previously unprobed regimes .",
    "we have explicitly shown the light curves of the secondary , third order and fourth order images for our six stars . moreover , we have shown the position in time of the secondary image w.r.t . the central black hole .",
    "we have given physical interpretations to our results , relating , in particular , the peaks to minima of @xmath3 and best alignment and anti - alignment times .",
    "we want to stress that this work is just a first analysis , which is susceptible to be corrected by eventual upcoming estimates of the orbital parameters , enlarged to eventual new candidate stars , and generalized to different classes of black holes .",
    "the most physically motivated generalization of the schwarzschild black hole is of course the kerr solution .",
    "however , while in the schwarzschild case the deflection angle can be still expressed analytically by equation ( [ alpha exact ] ) , the treatment of gravitational lensing by kerr black holes is done in a completely numerical way at the present time @xcite . moreover",
    ", the exact value of the spin of sgr a * is still very uncertain and inferred by indirect deductions @xcite .",
    "the deviations from the schwarzschild predictions are bigger for higher order images , while they become very small in the weak field limit .",
    "this means that a high value of the spin would considerably alter the predictions for higher order images , but , for example , the peak of the secondary image of s14 would be affected in a negligible way .",
    "so , for a first analysis , schwarzschild lensing is basically sufficient to understand the highlights of the lensing scenario and the order of magnitude of the observables .",
    "kerr lensing comes as a second step refinement .",
    "another topic that deserves some discussion concerns the uncertainties in our predictions coming from the present uncertainties in the estimates of the orbital parameters .",
    "the first thing to notice is that all these stars have been observed during their periapse epochs .",
    "we can thus be confident that even if the semimajor axis and the eccentricity are affected by large errors , the periapse distance is well determined by direct observations .",
    "since the inclinations are also relatively well determined , we can conclude that the magnitudes of the peaks can not be very different from the ones that we have calculated using the best - fit values of the orbital parameters .",
    "by contrast , the precise timing of the peaks is strictly related to the accuracy of the orbital period estimate .",
    "this can be established only with a good sampling on the whole orbit which requires more systematic observations in the future . as an example , given the present uncertainties , the brightness peak of the images of s14 could be displaced few years later or before the date that we have indicated using the best - fit value .",
    "finally , with the progress of the observation techniques , it is inevitable that new stars will be discovered around sgr a * and followed during their orbits .",
    "if new stars are discovered closer and closer to sgr a * , then the thin lens approximation can not be used any longer . in that case",
    ", the analysis should proceed in the way indicated by @xcite .",
    "all these considerations make us confident that even better candidates than s14 may be found in the future to open the era of gravitational lensing by strong fields ."
