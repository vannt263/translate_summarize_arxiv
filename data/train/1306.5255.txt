    "a _ coxeter group _ is a pair @xmath13 consisting of a group @xmath14 and a generating set @xmath15 which is presented using the relations @xmath16 for all @xmath17 and relations of the form @xmath18 for some , but not necessarily all , pairs @xmath19 .",
    "the most common examples of infinite coxeter groups are _ affine weyl groups _ , which are groups generated by the reflections of an affine space across special collections of hyperplanes coming from root systems .",
    "the theory of coxeter groups is both complicated and , especially in the case of affine weyl groups , highly - developed .",
    "affine weyl groups are ubiquitous in the subject of smooth representations of algebraic groups over non - archimedean local fields due to their connection with hecke algebras of reductive groups , and many questions about hecke algebras can be reduced to questions about affine weyl groups .",
    "let @xmath20 be a non - archimedean local field and let @xmath1 be a connected reductive affine algebraic @xmath20-group .",
    "if @xmath21 is a compact - open subgroup and @xmath22 is a smooth complex representation of @xmath23 then the _ hecke algebra _",
    "@xmath24 is the convolution algebra of all compactly - supported functions @xmath25 satisfying @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "many of the simple subcategories in the _ bernstein decomposition _ of the category of smooth representations of @xmath29 are equivalent to the category of modules over a hecke algebra of this form .",
    "the _ center _ of such a hecke algebra is important because it consists of the ( functorial ) @xmath29-linear endomorphisms of the representations in the subcategory .",
    "the case that @xmath23 is an _ iwahori subgroup _ and @xmath30 is the trivial @xmath31-dimensional representation yields one particularly important hecke algebra : the _ iwahori - hecke algebra_.    in general , an iwahori subgroup is the group of @xmath32-points of a certain connected model @xmath33 of @xmath1 defined in general by bruhat and tits , although in nice cases like @xmath34 there is a much more straightforward description : an iwahori subgroup is the inverse image in @xmath35 of a borel subgroup in @xmath36 under the reduction - mod-@xmath37 map @xmath38 .",
    "it can be shown that any iwahori - hecke algebra @xmath39 has a presentation , called the _ iwahori - matsumoto presentation _ , consisting of a basis of characteristic functions of the double - cosets @xmath40 together with a certain pair of relations which depend on some numerical parameters coming from @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that a group called the _ iwahori - weyl group _ serves as a system of representatives for these double - cosets .",
    "the iwahori - weyl group is in general merely a semidirect extension of an affine weyl group but its behavior is nonetheless extremely similar to that of a true coxeter group . taken together with the numerical parameters , the group - theoretic structure of this `` quasi - coxeter group '' completely controls the ring - theoretic structure of @xmath39 .    in this paper ,",
    "i prove a group - theoretic property of conjugacy classes in iwahori - weyl groups , which is described precisely in the next subsection of this introduction .",
    "the class of all iwahori - weyl groups properly contains the class of all affine weyl groups ( since affine weyl groups arise as the iwahori - weyl groups of semisimple and simply - connected @xmath1 ) and this property is new even in this narrower context .",
    "additionally , there are implications for iwahori - hecke algebras @xmath39 . for example",
    ", this property can be used to show that suitable linearly - independent collections of functions in the center @xmath41 also _ span _ the center .",
    "the prototypical example of such a collection is the _",
    "bernstein basis _ , although the existence and precise definition of such a basis do not appear in the literature for iwahori - hecke algebras of completely general connected reductive groups .",
    "the article @xcite fills this gap , which i explain in more detail next , and also serves as a sample application of the main theorem of this paper .    in unpublished work ,",
    "concerning essentially only the case of split @xmath1 , bernstein introduced a particularly important basis for @xmath41 whose elements can be effectively calculated ( by computer , if desired ) and which simultaneously have a straightforward representation - theoretic interpretation : the basis elements are indexed by @xmath42-orbits of cocharacters valued in a certain maximal torus @xmath43 , and if @xmath44 is such an orbit then the corresponding basis element @xmath45 acts on the iwahori - fixed subspace of the ( normalized ) induced representation @xmath46 of an unramified character @xmath47 by the scalar @xmath48 .",
    "this work was extended to the _ affine hecke algebra _ on any reduced root datum with any parameter system by lusztig in @xcite .",
    "an affine hecke algebra on a reduced root datum @xmath49 is constructed by using the _ extended affine weyl group _ @xmath50 as a vector space basis , choosing parameters , and mimicking the iwahori - matsumoto presentation abstractly ( see  3.2 of @xcite and  7.1 of @xcite for details ) .",
    "these abstractly defined affine hecke algebras are useful in the study of reductive groups for the following reason : in some cases , for example if @xmath1 is _ unramified _ , any iwahori - hecke algebra of @xmath1 is naturally isomorphic to an affine hecke algebra for appropriate choice of root datum and parameters .",
    "unfortunately , many iwahori - weyl groups are _ not _ the extended affine weyl group of any root datum .",
    "a specific example of such a @xmath1 is a ramified even - dimensional special orthogonal group ( see  1.16 in @xcite for the definition of such a group ) : such a group has _",
    "torsion _ in the translation subgroup of its iwahori - weyl groups , which simply can not happen in the extended affine weyl group of a root datum because its translation subgroup @xmath51 is free by definition .",
    "consequently , many iwahori - hecke algebras are _ not _ affine hecke algebras and so are not within the scope of the bernstein / lusztig work .    in the article @xcite , i extend the bernstein / lusztig results to iwahori - hecke algebras of _ all _ connected reductive @xmath20-groups . after establishing , analogous to @xcite , a bernstein presentation for an iwahori - hecke algebra @xmath39 of a general connected reductive @xmath20-group , i determine , again following @xcite , a bernstein basis for @xmath41 . to prove that these functions indeed span the center ,",
    "i apply the main theorem of this paper as explained in ",

    "it is known that @xmath53 contains as a normal subgroup the affine weyl group @xmath55 of a reduced root system @xmath56 , and that if @xmath57 is the subgroup of elements which act on @xmath58 by translations then @xmath53 splits as @xmath59 ( here @xmath42 denotes the finite weyl group ) .",
