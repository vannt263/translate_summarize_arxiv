    "many gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) observed by _ swift_/xrt present plateaus prior to the subsequent power - law decay phase in their early x - ray afterglows @xcite .",
    "the plateaus generally appear in 100 - 1000s since the grb trigger with a typical slope @xmath5 @xcite , where the flux of the plateau evolves as @xmath6 .",
    "the distribution of the observed temporal decay slope @xmath7 ( defined in @xmath8 ) after the plateau , ranging from less than 1 to much greater than 1 ( even to 10 ) , is quite diverse . according to the standard model for grb afterglows ( for a recent complete reference",
    "see @xcite ) , it is hard to understand some observed @xmath7 with large values . unless the plateau happens to be followed with the jet - like phase , which seems to be unlikely , the external shock models can not explain @xmath9 ( for details see next section ) .",
    "therefore , it is now known that there are generally two types of plateaus .",
    "the first one is `` external plateau '' , characterized by a normal decay ( @xmath10 ) after the plateau , which is currently understood as being due to energy injection into the external shock @xcite .",
    "a tight correlation for x - ray plateaus between the break time @xmath11 and the corresponding x - ray luminosity @xmath12 was recently discovered by @xcite and @xcite , who selected the sample with the slope of the follow - up decay phase generally less than 1.5 .",
    "the second type is called `` internal plateau '' , characterized by a steep decay ( @xmath9 ) after the plateau , which might be originated from internal dissipation of magnetic energy continuously blew out from the central engine @xcite .",
    "one possible candidate of the central engine responsible for external energy injection as well as internally dissipative magnetic energy is an ultra highly magnetized and rapidly rotating neutron star , which is also called magnetar @xcite .",
    "the rotation energy of the magnetar can be tapped through magnetic dipole radiation ( mdr ) and/or relativistic leptonic wind @xcite .",
    "this speculation can be realized if the initial rotation period @xmath2 and dipole magnetic field @xmath3 of the central neutron stars are found to be consistent with our expectation @xcite .",
    "since the magnetar model is almost the only successful model for internal plateaus , assuming dissipative magnetic energy is from mdr , one can derive the initial period @xmath2 and magnetic field strength @xmath3 if the spin - down luminosity @xmath13 and spin - down timescale @xmath14 of the magnetar are known .",
    "@xcite applied this method by assuming the emission efficiency @xmath15 to fit the observed x - ray plateaus , where @xmath16 is the total bolometric luminosity in the @xmath17 kev in the cosmologically rest frame extrapolated from the observed x - ray luminosity @xmath18 measured by _",
    "@xcite considered five remarkable plateaus with sharp drops as a sample to discuss magnetars as the central engine of grbs , and found that the luminosity emitted in x - ray band is a fraction of the total spin - down luminosity . in this paper , we collect all _ swift _ long grbs with a steep decay after the plateau and infer the stellar parameters based on the magnetar model .",
    "we assume that the end time of the plateau phase corresponds to the spin - down time scale @xmath14 and that @xmath19 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "to more understand the physics behind @xmath20 , we draw lessons from persistent x - ray emission of normal pulsars .",
    "the dissipation of the rotation energy of a normal pulsar to its persistent x - ray radiation could be similar to or the same as a millisecond magnetar in a grb , in which both spin down through magnetic dipole radiation . unlike grb magnetars ,",
    "the emission efficiency of a pulsar in x - ray can be directly calculated as the observed x - ray luminosity @xmath21 divided by the spin - down luminosity @xmath13 . in order to understand the mechanism by which the stellar rotation energy is converted into x - ray emission",
    ", a tight correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath13 of pulsars has been widely studied @xcite . because distinct components of x - ray emission have different origins for normal pulsars , we here focus on the nonpulsed component of x - ray emission from pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "as stated above , since both millisecond magnetars in grbs and normal pulsars spin down through magnetic dipole radiation , we assume that they have the same correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath13 .",
    "evidence for this assumption is as follows .",
    "( 1 ) @xcite found that the the dipolar magnetic field of the young pulsar psr j1846.0258 is about @xmath22 g , which is higher than those of normal pulsars , but lower than those of magnetars .",
    "moreover , the detection of magnetar - like emission from this pulsar suggests that there is a continuum of magnetar - like activity throughout all neutron stars .",
    "( 2 ) @xcite found that the @xmath12-@xmath1 correlation of the magnetar candidate anomalous x - ray pulsar 1e1547.0 - 5408 is similar to that of pwn pulsars . in this paper , therefore , we extend the @xmath12-@xmath1 correlation from normal pulsars to magnetars , and obtain the spin - down luminosity of magnetars by using the observed luminosity of a plateau .    the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the selection of the pulsar and plateau samples , and carry out empirical fittings to the observed plateau light curves . the correlation in and between pulsars and grbs",
    "are calculated and discussed in section 3 .",
    "our conclusions and discussion are presented in the last section .",
    "the nonthermal nonpulsed x - ray emission from rotation - powered pulsars has been studied in the context of emission from pwne . here",
    "we mainly investigate the nonpulsed x - ray emission from pwne .",
    "we exclude x - ray pulsars powered by accretion from binary companions , and collect x - ray observational data of 101 pulsars with pwn from the published literature @xcite .",
    "we find a correlation of @xmath12-@xmath1 with the 101 pwn sample ( see next section ) .",
    "this correlation also indicates the fraction of the rotational energy loss of a pulsar going into x - ray emission .",
    "x - ray plateaus are a common phenomenon in the afterglow observations .",
    "much work has been done for theoretical explanations and statistic analysis for shallow decays @xcite . in the external shock models , usually the decay slope after the plateau is @xmath23 if the environment is an interstellar medium ( ism ) with a constant density , or sometimes ( almost unlikely in x - ray after the plateau phase ) @xmath24 if the environment is a stellar wind , where @xmath25 is the power - law index of the energy distribution of shock - accelerated electrons . the typical value of @xmath25 is about 2.3 , however , it can range from 2.0 to 3.0 or even more smaller and larger . therefore , the typical value of @xmath7 is @xmath26 and the maximal allowable value by the model is 1.75 .",
    "the possibility of the coincidence that the plateau happens to be followed by the jet - like phase is extremely small . even in this case , @xmath27 for an ism environment and @xmath28 for a wind environment , as long as the jet sideways expansion can be neglected .",
    "if the jet sideways expansion play the role , the value of @xmath29 is typically @xmath30 .",
    "as can be seen , the above values of @xmath7 can not explain the large decay slope after the plateau observed in some grbs .",
    "internal plateaus with large @xmath7 are thought to be due to magnetic energy dissipation at small radii , so that when the central engine ceases the decay timescale ( equivalent to decay slope ) is very short . in this paper , we focus on internal plateaus and the criterion to be internal plateaus is @xmath9 .",
    "we have collected 24 long duration grb ( @xmath31 s ) x - ray plateaus with this judgement .",
    "some of the grbs in this sample have no redshift measurements , and we adopt pseudo - redshift estimated by the @xmath32 correlation for them @xcite . we suppose that the ending of an x - ray plateau corresponds to the spin - down time of the magnetar .",
    "the centrifugal force reduces as the magnetar spins down significantly , the magnetar collapses into a black hole due to the imbalance of the gravity and outward forces .",
    "it is likely that the ending of the plateau , the spin - down and collapse of the magnetar coincidently happen at the same time .",
    "we have collected 24 remarkable x - ray afterglow light curves in our sample .",
    "we apply a smooth broken power - law and an extra power - law to fit the light curves .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "generally speaking , the break ( ending ) time ( @xmath33 s ) of internal plateaus is longer than that ( @xmath34 s ) of normal / external plateaus .",
    "the break time of the internal plateau ( @xmath11 ) is assumed to be the spin - down time of a magnetar ( @xmath35 ) , i.e. @xmath36where @xmath37 is the initial angular frequency , @xmath38 is moment of inertia , @xmath39 is the stellar radius , and @xmath40 is the speed of light . the isotropic x - ray luminosity at the break time @xmath41 is calculated by @xmath42where @xmath43 is the redshift , @xmath44 is the luminosity distance , @xmath45 is the observed x - ray flux at the end time of the plateau phase , and @xmath46 is the spectral index of the x - ray afterglow which can be found from the _",
    "swift_/xrt website @xcite .",
    "the spin - down luminosity of a pulsar / magnetar can be expressed as @xmath47when @xmath48 . with equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , we obtain the initial period and the dipole magnetic field of the pulsar / magnetar as @xmath49and @xmath50with the fitting results ( see table 1 ) and assuming @xmath51 g @xmath52 , @xmath53 cm , we can constrain the initial period ( @xmath2 ) and the dipole magnetic field strength ( @xmath3 ) of the pulsar / magnetar .",
    "it has been found that @xmath12 and @xmath1 in pulsars have a power - law relationship , but different authors have obtained different power - law indices @xcite . by analyzing observed x - ray data of 101 pwn pulsars from the published literature , we find that ( see figure 1 ) @xmath12 and @xmath1 have a tight correlation @xmath55 thus , the corresponding conversion efficiency of the rotational energy of a pulsar into nonpulsed x - ray emission is @xmath56 showing that the efficiency @xmath20 is dependent on the spin - down luminosity .",
    "the conversion efficiency of the rotational energy of a magnetar into x - ray emission , in order to interpret x - ray plateaus , is unknown .",
    "some papers , such as @xcite , generally adopted the efficiency of the rotational energy into the @xmath57 kev emission as @xmath58 in their calculations . however , their extrapolation from x - ray to @xmath57 kev is based on the x - ray spectral index , which may not be applicable beyond the xrt band . in this paper",
    "we consider x - ray plateaus followed by steep decays as central engine afterglows from magnetars , and assume that such magnetars and rotation - powered pulsars have the same mechanism that x - ray emission are from internal dissipation of poynting flux .",
    "evidence for this assumption comes from the possible fact that pulsars and magnetars may have the same @xmath12-@xmath1 correlation @xcite , that is , the @xmath12 and @xmath1 of the magnetar candidate , the anomalous x - ray pulsar 1e1547.0 - 5408 , satisfy the correlation in pwn pulsars .",
    "therefore , we extend the correlation of @xmath12 and @xmath1 from rotation - powered pulsars to magnetars .",
    "the corresponding conversion efficiency of the rotational energy of a magnetar into x - ray emission is also given by equation ( 7 ) .",
    "the spin - down luminosity during x - ray plateaus can be calculated by equation ( 6 ) , where @xmath12 is the luminosity at the end of the plateau ( see table 1 ) .",
    "there are some grbs without redshift measurement .",
    "in these cases , their redshifts can be estimated by the correlation between @xmath18 and @xmath11 from @xcite . with the derived spin - down luminosity",
    ", we can further calculate the initial period @xmath2 and the dipole magnetic field strength @xmath3 of a magnetar with equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "table 1 shows that the derived initial spin period of the magnetars ranges from 1 to 10 ms , which is well consistent with the values expected in the magnetar formation hypothesis .",
    "the dipole magnetic field @xmath3 of table 1 is in the range of @xmath59 g , which is consistent with the magnetic field of soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars .",
    "figure 2 shows the magnetic field and spin period for both long and short grb candidates .",
    "the magnetars could be roughly divided by @xmath60 g into two different samples , short grb candidates above the line and long grb candidates below the line .",
    "one caveat is that there are some grbs with extended emission included in the sample plotting figure 2 . because their distribution is similar to that of the short ones @xcite ,",
    "we consider them as one subset of the short grb candidates .",
    "compared with the long grbs , the short grb candidates tend to have higher magnetic fields . from our statistics , we find the initial spin period mainly in the range @xmath61 ms and the dipole magnetic field in the range @xmath62 g for the long grb magnetars .",
    "these values are all reasonable , implying that internal plateaus could be powered by a central spinning - down magnetar .",
    "the x - ray plateaus can be explained as being due to continuous energy injection from central engines after the prompt bursts and rapidly rotating , ultra - strongly magnetized pulsars are good candidates of such grb central engines . in this paper , we have collected 24 remarkable long - grb x - ray plateaus followed by sharp drops .",
    "we assumed that the x - ray plateaus are powered by internal magnetic energy dissipation of poynting flux from a magnetar and the sudden drop is caused by the spin - down and collapse of the magnetar . on the other hand",
    ", we gathered the x - ray observational data on @xmath18 and @xmath63 of 101 pwn pulsars from the published literature , and fitted them with a power law function ( figure 1 ) , @xmath64 .",
    "we assumed that magnetars and rotation - powered pulsars may experience a common internal dissipation mechanism .",
    "thus , we extended the correlation of @xmath65 and @xmath1 from rotation - powered pulsars to x - ray plateaus .",
    "we find that for the magnetar candidates in the 24 long grbs , the initial period @xmath2 is about 1 to 10 ms , while the dipole magnetic field strength @xmath3 is in the range of @xmath66 to @xmath4 g. this result implies that the central engines of some long grbs are millisecond magnetars .",
    "millisecond magnetars are not only proposed as the central engines of some long grbs , but also they may survive from some binary neutron star mergers that power short grbs .",
    "the long - lasting activity of the central magnetars have been suggested to interpret the x - ray flares and plateaus following some short grbs @xcite and the statistical properties of x - ray flares from both long and short grbs @xcite .",
    "recently , such a survived massive millisecond magnetar scenario has been studied to predict a bright multi - wavelength afterglow @xcite and invoked to explain an unusual energetic transient ptf11agg @xcite .",
    "we therefore suggest that millisecond magnetars play an important role in both long and short grbs .",
