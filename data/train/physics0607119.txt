    "domain wall energy is given by @xmath8 illustrating once again the competing role of exchange and anisotropy .",
    "+ for bulk materials , walls of the bloch type occur whereas in thin films nel type walls are encountered when the film thickness is close to the exchange length ( defined by @xmath9 , which is a few nanometers for ferromagnetic materials like ni , fe or co , see table  [ ferro ] ) . in the case of soft or amorphous materials characterised by a vanishing anisotropy constant @xmath5",

    "[ bwall ] a bloch wall , belonging to the class ( @xmath14 ) is depicted with the magnetization rotating in a vertical plane .",
    "+ mathematically , a domain wall appears as a result of a non - linear two - point boundary value problem ( tpbvp ) since it separates two distinct regions with a well defined value of the magnetization .",
    "the tpbvp originates from a minimization of the total magnetic energy that contains in general a competition between the anisotropy and exchange energies .",
    "+ in this work , a general numerical approach based on the relaxation method is applied to the study of domain profiles in several geometries : bulk , wires and thin films .",
    "+ this report is organised as follows : in section 2 , the numerical relaxation method is described ; in section 3 we discuss bloch walls , whereas radial walls in cylindrical wires are described in section 4 . in section",
    "5 nel walls are described and finally section 6 contains a discussion and a conclusion .",
    "traditionally , tpbvp are typically tackled with the shooting method .",
    "the shooting method typically progresses from one boundary point to another using , for instance , runga - kutta integration @xcite with a set of initial conditions attempting at reaching the end boundary . + for regular ordinary differential equations ( ode ) , simple shooting is enough to reach the solution . in more complicated ode",
    ", one has to rely on double shooting also called shooting to a fitting point .",
    "the algorithm consists of shooting from both boundaries to a middle point ( fitting point ) where continuity of the solution and derivative are required . in certain cases ,",
    "one even has to perform multiple shooting in order to converge toward the solution @xcite .",
    "+ in the case of presence of singularities ( within the domain or at the boundaries ) the shooting method in all its versions : simple , double or multiple does not usually converge .",
    "we find that it is the case also with domain walls because of a rapid drop of the solution somewhere in the integration interval ( due to the rapid change of the magnetization orientation in the wall ) . in this work ,",
    "we develop , a new method to tackle the domain wall problem based on the relaxation method and find it quite suitable to handle relatively fast changes in the solution . + the basic idea of the relaxation method is to convert the differential equation into a finite difference equation ( fde ) .",
    "when the problem involves a system of @xmath16 coupled first - order ode s represented by fde s on a mesh of @xmath17 points , a solution consists of values for @xmath16 dependent functions given at each of the @xmath18 mesh points , that is @xmath19 variables in all .",
    "the relaxation method determines the solution by starting with a guess and improving it , iteratively .",
    "the iteration scheme is very efficient since it is based on the multidimensional newton s method ( see _ numerical recipes _",
    "the matrix equation that must be solved , takes a special , block diagonal form , that can be inverted far more economically both in time and storage than would be possible for a general matrix of size @xmath20 .",

[ nwall ] ) , we obtain : = -div=-=-m_s [ rho1 ]    the ode that controls the wall profile @xmath50 is derived exactly as before ( taking account of the exchange and anisotropy terms ) with the addition of the zeeman term accounting for the presence of the internal field @xmath79 : 2a -k 2 + m_s h(x ) = 0 [ neelode ]    the uniaxial anisotropy term is @xmath80 with @xmath53 , the angle the magnetization makes with the @xmath81 axis ( the anisotropy axis ) .",
    "note that the demagnetization energy ( due to the finite thickness of the film along the @xmath51 direction ) is zero , since it is given by @xmath82 with @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "the difference between this equation and the previous ones ( bloch and radial cases ) is that the internal field term @xmath73 depends on the profile @xmath50 .",
