    "quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite is a measure of nonclassical correlations which include not only quantum correlations with entanglement but also entanglement - free quantum correlations that may occur in separable states .",
    "qd captures the nonclassical correlations , more general than entanglement , that can exist between parts of a quantum system even if the corresponding quantum entanglement does vanish .",
    "qd is considered to be a more general resource of quantum advantage than quantum entanglement in quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "qd has been investigated in a wider context @xcite including entanglement - free quantum computation @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , and quantum phase transitions in many - body physics @xcite . in this paper , we add superradiance and subradiance to the list of qd applications . we show that qd can induce superradiance and subradiance in a system of two separated atoms .",
    "superradiance , first introduced by dicke @xcite , is a coherent spontaneous emission generated by the cooperative effect of many atoms , molecules , or nuclei . at this point",
    ", all the atoms simultaneously interact with a common radiation field and exhibit a collective behavior due to the coherent superposition .",
    "ordinary spontaneous emission is usually incoherent spontaneous radiation , because the phases of radiations of different atoms have no any correlation with each other . as a consequence ,",
    "the emitted light pulse is a simple algebraic addition of the independent radiation intensity , and its shape decays exponentially .",
    "the shape of superradiant pulse , however , does not take on exponential decay and has a peak after a certain delay . note that superradiant emission in certain directions is accompanied by subradiant emission in other different directions @xcite . in the original dicke model ,",
    "the superradiance was shown to be a consequence of the macroscopic dipole moment produced by the collective coherent behavior of numerous atoms in a local system .",
    "it has been shown that the larger the macroscopic dipole moment is , the more visible the superradiance phenomenon will be . since the superradiance was observed firstly by skribanowitz _",
    "et al _ @xcite , it has attracted considerable interest and been extensively investigated @xcite , due to its wide applications such as generating @xmath0-ray lasers with higher power .",
    "much of the aforementioned literatures were focused on the ensembles of atoms with inherent complexities associated with ensembles , where the interatomic distance was considered to be shorter than the emission wavelength .",
    "recently , wiegner , zanthier , and agarwal @xcite investigated the superradiance phenomenon of an @xmath1-atom system prepared in the canonical @xmath2 state @xcite .",
    "it was shown that superradiance occurs even if the interatomic distance is larger than the wavelength of the emitted photons , due to the existence of quantum entanglement among these atoms .",
    "it should be pointed out that such a system has no dipole moment due to the fact that the distance between any two atoms is larger than the emission wavelength and the dipole - dipole interactions are negligible .    in this paper , we study the radiative characteristics of emission for a two - atom system with quantum correlations characterized by the qd .",
    "we show that two atoms in a nonzero - qd state can create superradiance and subradiance even without interatomic entanglement , that is , entanglement - free qd can induce superradiance and subradiance .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we investigate the radiative characteristics of the emission from the two two - level atoms initially in a @xmath0-type state , and demonstrate the existence of the qd - induced super- and sub - radiance phenomena . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we analyze quantum statistical properties of emitted photons and indicate that photons in super- and sub - radiance may display different statistical statistics . in particular , it is found that the qd effect can induce nonclassical photon statistics and the transition from the super - poissonian to sub - poissonian statistics .",
    "finally , this work is concluded in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "in this section , we investigate radiation properties of a quantum system consisting of two separated atoms .",
    "we show that quantum discord can induce superradiance and subradiance of the two - atom system which is initially in a @xmath0-type state .",
    "the system under our consideration is shown in fig .",
    "it consists of two identical two - level atoms which are localized at positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , with @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 with the wave number @xmath7 , so that the dipole - dipole interaction can be neglected .",
    "-axis with coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "a detector is placed at position @xmath10 in the far field of the source with a directional angle @xmath11.,width=302,height=188 ]    we now consider a detector placed at position @xmath12 in the far - field region of the two atoms to measure the emission intensity @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 [ @xmath16 are , respectively , the positive and negative frequency parts of the electric field operator .",
    "@xmath14 is given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the unit vector , @xmath19 is the dipole moment of the transition @xmath20 , @xmath21 denotes the relative optical phase accumulated by a photon emitted at @xmath22 and detected at @xmath12 . for clarity",
    ", we assume @xmath19 is along the @xmath23-axis direction and @xmath24 is in the @xmath25 plane , which means @xmath26 . under these conditions and omitting all constant factors , eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) reduces to @xcite @xmath27 the field is now dimensionless and hence all intensities would be dimensionless .",
    "the actual values can be obtained by multiplying the emission produced by a single excited atom .",
    "the initial state of the two atoms is taken to be a @xmath0-type state given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the identity operator in the hilbert space of two qubits , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , the pauli matrices of qubits @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the real numbers @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) satisfy the conditions that the state - density matrix @xmath36 is positive and the trace of it is unit . here we have used the conventional denotations @xmath37^t$ ] and @xmath38^t$ ] .",
    "such a state has the maximally mixed marginal , that is , @xmath39 .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ a ] ) and ( [ c ] ) , we can obtain the dimensionless radiation intensity of the two atoms in the @xmath0-type state of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , @xmath40 it can be seen that the radiation intensity @xmath41 can be larger or less than unit .",
    "note that when the atoms emit photons at random , the radiation intensity is one , due to the fact that the probability of the two atoms occupying the excited state is @xmath42=1.\\label{7}\\ ] ] thus , eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) indicates that it is possible to create superradiance ( @xmath43 ) and subradiance ( @xmath44 ) for the two - atom system in the @xmath0-type state .    in the following ,",
    "we give a detailed discussion on the case of @xmath45 . in this case , the @xmath0-type state in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) reduces to a werner state @xcite , characterized by a single parameter , given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the nonclassical correlation of the werner state can be quantified by quantum discord @xcite , which is calculated to be @xcite @xmath48 the amount of entanglement of the werner state can be measured by concurrence @xcite , which is given by @xmath49 obviously , the concurrence is zero for @xmath50 .",
    "this indicates that the werner state in the parameter regime of @xmath50 is a separable quantum state without entanglement .",
    "however , from eq .",
    "( 9 ) we can find that the qd of the werner state in the parameter regime of @xmath50 is nonzero .",
    "hence , the werner state with @xmath50 is such a quantum state with quantum correlation but without quantum entanglement . in particular , at the entanglement - transition point of @xmath51 , we have the qd with @xmath52 .",
    "the numerical analysis indicates that both the qd amount @xmath53 and the concurrence @xmath54 increase with the increasing of the state parameter @xmath55 in the range @xmath56 @xcite .     with respect to the qd amount @xmath57 and the direction angle parameter @xmath58 , where @xmath59.,width=302,height=264 ]    for the werner state in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) , the radiation intensity given by eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) becomes @xmath60 from which we can see that the radiation intensity depends on not only the interatomic distance @xmath61 and the detection angle @xmath11 but also the state parameter @xmath55 for a given wave vector @xmath62 .",
    "we have plotted the radiation intensity with respect to the qd and the direction angle parameter @xmath63 in fig .",
    "2 which indicates the existence of the qd - induced superradiance and subradiance in different angle regimes . from fig .",
    "2 we can see that the nearby region along the @xmath64-axis direction with @xmath65 is the subradiance region with @xmath66 while the nearby region along the @xmath67-axis direction with @xmath68 is the superradiance region with @xmath43 .    in order to clearly see the qd influence on the radiation intensity , in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted the radiation intensity with respect to the qd for the directional parameter @xmath58 taking @xmath69 and @xmath32 , respectively . from fig .",
    "3 we can clearly see the qd - induced superradiant and subradiant phenomena .",
    "the superradiance appears in the branch of @xmath70 while the subradiance occurs in the branch of @xmath71 .",
    "the superradiance ( subradiance ) is enhanced with the increase of the qd of the werner state since the radiation intensity @xmath41 monotonically increases ( decreases ) with increasing of the qd value @xmath53 .",
    "this shows that the qd can enhance the superradiance and subradiance .     versus the qd amount @xmath57 with @xmath63 taking @xmath32 ( the solid line ) and @xmath69 ( the dashed line ) , respectively .",
    "here we take @xmath59.,width=302,height=264 ]    a notable consequence could be obtained from fig .",
    "3 that quantum correlation is at least a necessary condition for generating superradiant and subradiant emission for the two - separated - atom system under our consideration . note that when @xmath72 , the werner state has no entanglement while its quantum discord is larger than zero ( @xmath73 ) @xcite .",
    "this implies that entanglement is not a necessary condition for yielding superradiance and subradiance , in contrast to the case where the atoms are initially in a pure entangled state , supporting the necessity of entanglement @xcite to produce superradiance and subradiance .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that quantum correlations without entanglement , i.e. , the entanglement - free qd , can induce and enhance the superradiance and subradiance of two separated atoms .",
    "this section aims at revealing the quantum statistical behavior of radiated photons by analyzing the second - order correlation function of the radiation intensity .",
    "we only pay attention to the photon statistics in superradiance and subradiance .",
    "it will be shown that quantum statistical properties of photons in the superradiance are different from those in the subradiance .",
    "more interestingly , we find that the qd can induce nonclassical photon statistics @xcite and the statistical property could jump from the classical super - poissonian to the nonclassical sub - poissonian in some angle regimes .    the second - order correlation function of the radiation intensity is defined as @xmath74 ^{2 } } , \\label{11}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the density operator of the radiation field . with the second - order correlation function",
    ", one can distinguish between the possibly different statistical regimes .",
    "in particular , @xmath76 denotes the sub - poissionian statistics of the radiation field , @xmath77 means the sub - poissionian statistics , and @xmath78 reflects the poissionian statistics .    after a straightforward calculation",
    "we obtain the second - order correlation function of the radiation intensity of the two atoms being initially in the werner state of eq .",

    "this point can be understood from the fact that qd vanishes in this case , that is , there is no any quantum correlation between the two atoms .",
    "and the directional angle @xmath11 when the @xmath59.,width=302,height=264 ]    in order to observe how the quantum correlations affect quantum statistical properties of the radiation photons in the superradiant and subradiant regimes , we perform numerical simulations for the influence of the qd of the atomic initial state on the second - order correlation function of the radiation intensity . in fig .",
    "4 , we have plotted the second - order correlation function with respect to the amount of qd @xmath53 and the directional angle parameter @xmath58 . combining fig .",
    "4 with fig .",
    "2 , we can see that photons in the superradiant regime of @xmath82 exhibit the sub - poissonian statistics with @xmath83 . in the subradiant regime of @xmath84 ,",
    "the quantum statistical properties of the radiated photons become more complicated as shown below .",
    "the second - order correlation function may have an inflexion and the photon statistics may change sharply with the variation of the qd amount . these effects lead to an interesting phenomenon that qd can induce the photon statistics transition from the classical super - poissonian to the sub - poissonian statistics .",
    "such a phenomenon can be observed more clearly in fig .",
    "5 which gives the second - order correlation function as a function of the qd amount @xmath53 with @xmath85 .",
    "it can be seen that the transition point happens at the position of @xmath86 .",
    "photon statistics in the range @xmath87 is the super - poissonian while photon statistics in the range @xmath88 is the sub - poissonian . at the transition point",
    "@xmath89 , photon statistics is the poissonian .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that quantum statistical behaviors of radiation photons can be manipulated by changing the interatomic quantum correlations for some fixed direction angles , and that the qd can induce the photon statistics transition from classical super - poissonian to the sub - poissonian statistics .",

    "in conclusion , we have studied collective radiant properties of two separated atoms in @xmath0-type quantum states .",
    "it has been shown that qd can induce and enhance superradiance and subradiance in the two - atom system .",
    "more interestingly , we have found that quantum correlations without any entanglement can induce and enhance superradiance and subradiance .",
    "this sheds a new light on applications of qd as a quantum resource with quantum advantages .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated quantum statistical properties of emitted photons in both regions of superradiance and subradiance by addressing the second - order correlation function .",
    "when the initial state of the two separated atoms is the werner state with non - zero qd , it has been found that radiation photons in the superradiant region exhibit the nonclassical sub - poissonian statistics and the degree of the sub - poissonian statistics increases with increasing of the qd amount .",
    "however , radiation photons in the subradiant region have different statistical characteristics , they are either the sub - poissonian or the super - poissonian statistics , depending on the amount of qd and the directional angle .",
    "a particularly interesting finding is that in the subradiance region the qd can induce photon statistics transition from the super - poissonian to sub - poissonian statistics .",
