    "here , we continue our investigation into the so - called ` raspberry ' model , which was first introduced by lobaskin and dnweg .",
    "@xcite the raspberry model allows for the incorporation of a colloidal particle into the lattice - boltzmann ( lb ) algorithm by discretizing the surface into point particles and utilizing the coupling scheme of ahlrichs and dnweg  @xcite for these points .",
    "the model derives its name from the discretized nature of the colloid s surface , which resembles a raspberry , when represented by molecular - dynamics ( md ) beads , see fig .",

    "the central bead to which all other beads are connected _ via _ rigid bonds is shown using a green sphere .",
    "the blue spheres represent the beads that form the filled raspberry and the red ones give the surface beads used for the hollow variant .",
    "the radius of the beads is chosen to be smaller than the typical effective hydrodynamic radius to help visualize the internal structure . ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite we demonstrated the raspberry s ability to accurately capture hydrodynamic interactions in a simple - cubic arrangement .",
    "we discussed how the point coupling leads to an effective hydrodynamic radius that can be fitted for .",
    "as shown by ollila  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite there is a mismatch between the effective hydrodynamic radii when the coupling points are placed on a spherical shell .",
    "ollila  _ et al . _",
    "contend that this is related to the porosity of the raspberry particle , also see part i  @xcite , that is inherent to this coupling method .",
    "we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that one can effectively match the raspberry to results for solid particles within a reasonable parameter regime , via a procedure which we dubbed ` filling + fitting . ' that is , a raspberry particle with internal coupling points ( filled ) , for which effective hydrodynamic radii are established via hydrodynamic experiments ( fitting ) , shows excellent _ numerical _ correspondence for the two fitted hydrodynamic radii .",
    "moreover , the results agree well with theoretical predictions for a solid particle in the stokes limit , in the intermediate and long - time regime .    in this paper , we study the confining geometry of two parallel plates , to further demonstrate the quality of the ` filling + fitting ' procedure .",
    "this geometry is of particular interest , since to the best of our knowledge , no systematic study of the quality of the particle - coupling method of ref .",
    "@xcite has been attempted in which the level of confinement was the crucial parameter .",
    "a two plate geometry has been applied in various works , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite , but always with the intention to extrapolate the results to infinite plate separations or extract bulk properties . for our study of small plate separations ( strong confinement ) in this manuscript",
    ", we use a variety of literature results to compare our results against .",
    "the first analytic expressions for the mobility of the sphere - plate system were derived by faxen  @xcite , who restricted his study to spheres constrained to the mid - plane .",
    "brenner derived an expression for mobility of a sphere close to a single wall  @xcite ( in the direction perpendicular to the wall ) , which was later extended to a parallel - plate geometry in refs .",
    "@xcite . these publications ( @xcite )",
    "are but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the semi - analytic and numerical work that has been carried out on these and comparable geometries .",
    "other works include : semi - analytic calculations ,  @xcite numerical simulations that exploit analytic approximations to capture hydrodynamic behavior ,  @xcite and simulations that employ coarse - grained hydrodynamic solvers to fully resolve hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "@xcite in addition , numerous experimental studies into the diffusive behavior of spheres under confinement ,  @xcite as well as other shapes ,  @xcite have been undertaken .",
    "however , it goes beyond the confines of this introduction to fully list and do justice to all these investigations .    in the following ,",
    "we use some of the above literature results to prove that the hollow and filled raspberry reproduce stokesian hydrodynamic interactions for a sphere confined between two parallel plates . as in part",
    "i , the ` filling + fitting ' procedure is shown to resolve the issue of the mismatch between the effective hydrodynamic radii that the hollow variant of the raspberry suffers from , to within acceptable numerical tolerance .",
    "we also show that hydrodynamic interactions are properly captured by the raspberry - lb method up to one lattice spacing away from either wall .",
    "this is a reasonable result , since lubrication corrections for this point - coupling method have not yet been established . in the right limits",
    ", we were able to demonstrate that the mean - square displacement also yields the proper position dependence of the translational mobility in a thermalized lb fluid .",
    "finally , we used our high - quality numerical data to establish empirical relations for this position dependence for cases where literature values were not available or did not extend over the full range of plate separations .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : methods ] we describe the aspects of our simulation methods that were not covered in part i  @xcite in detail .",
    "section  [ sub : exper ] describes the various hydrodynamic experiments that we performed to determine the properties of the raspberry model . for certain experiments we used finite - element calculations as the basis for comparison ,",
    "the specifics of these are provided in section  [ sub : fe ] .",
    "we provide a summary of the notations used throughout the text in section  [ sub : notation ] to aid the reader when going through the manuscript . in section  [ sec : result ] we list our main results .",

    "finally , we give a summary , conclusions , and an outlook in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section , we outline the modeling approaches used to determine the hydrodynamic properties of a colloid .",
    "we have split this into subsections detailing aspects of the hydrodynamic experiments performed to extract the mobility of the raspberry , the finite - element calculations , and a reference list of the input parameters and measured quantities . for details on the construction of the raspberry model and the molecular dynamics ( md ) and lattice - boltzmann ( lb ) parameters employed in our investigation ,",

    "we use the term ` quiescent ' to describe an un - thermalized ( non - fluctuating , deterministic ) lb fluid .",
    "we set up the system of a particle confined between two parallel plates as follows",
    ". a channel of height @xmath0 was simulated using @xmath1 lattice points along the @xmath2-axis ( one layer of boundary cells on either side ) . in the @xmath3-plane the box had an extent @xmath4 in both directions and periodic boundary conditions were applied in these directions .",
    "we used finite - size scaling to remove any dependence on @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we varied the box size and fitted to the result for @xmath5 ; typically the results were sufficiently converged for @xmath6 .",
    "the bounce - back boundary condition  @xcite was applied to the first and final layer of points in @xmath2-direction , leading to an effective hydrodynamic channel height of @xmath0 with a no - slip surface .",
    "the height was confirmed by hagen - poiseuille flow measurements , by comparing to the theoretical fluid flow profile and fitting for the channel height .",
    "for all experiments the raspberry was initialized at a height @xmath2 , measured with respect to the center of the channel ( @xmath7 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plate ] .",
    "the following experiments for a spherical particle confined between two parallel plates were performed , as detailed below . in ref .",
    "@xcite we discuss in detail the reynolds number ( @xmath8 ) , pclet number ( @xmath9 ) , schmidt number ( @xmath10 ) , as well as other dimensionfree constants at which these experiments were carried out .",
    "for the purposes of this manuscript , it suffices to know that the typical values of these numbers are @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",

    "* a _ velocity _ experiment in a fluid , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plate](a ) .",
    "the particle was kept fixed at the initial position .",
    "its surface velocity was held constant , by resetting the velocity in every time step .",
    "thus an effective velocity boundary condition is obtained , without the particle changing position .",
    "the mobility was subsequently determined by measuring the force on the particle in the stationary state .",
    "this approach is similar to the one employed for the finite - element calcultions in section  [ sub : fe ] .",
    "since the particle does not move , the position dependence of the translational mobility parallel and perpendicular to the wall could be accurately assessed .",
    "* a _ force _ experiment in a fluid , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plate](b ) .",
    "the particle was allowed to move freely and a constant force was applied to its center of mass .",
    "the position dependent mobility for movement parallel to the walls could be determined by extracting the terminal velocity .",
    "this terminal velocity was averaged over at least 10 periods of the ( slight ) oscillation in this parameter due to interpolation artifacts .",
    "it proved unnecessary to fix the particle in the @xmath2 direction , since there was no appreciable vertical drift .",
    "the presence of the boundary breaks the symmetry of the system , when the particle is not in the center of the channel .",
    "therefore , there can be rotational and translational cross - coupling terms in the hydrodynamic mobility tensor ( hmt ) .",
    "@xcite to examine this we also measured the angular velocity of the particle .",
    "* a _ torque _ experiment in a fluid , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plate](c ) .",
    "a constant torque was applied to the particle about an axis parallel ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plate](c ) , left ) or perpendicular ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plate](c ) , right ) to the walls and the angular velocity was measured .",
    "again it proved unnecessary to fix the particle in the @xmath2 direction . for rotation about an axis parallel to the wall",
    ", we also fixed the particle s position , to examine the effect of cross coupling . * a mean - square displacement ( msd ) experiment in a fluid , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plate](d ) .",
    "the system was equilibrated until the particle fluctuated with the proper imposed fluid temperature .",
    "then over many integration cycles ( typically @xmath14 per run ) and for several runs , we kept track of the position of the particle .",
    "the positions were binned according to the following procedure .",
    "each bin was made half a lattice spacing ( 0.5@xmath15 ) in width for the direction of interest .",
    "all sub - trajectories of our runs that originated in a specific bin were assigned to that bin and followed until they exited the bin . to ensure a minimum smearing out of the position dependence",
    ", we selected only those parts of the trajectories that went through a slice 0.1@xmath15 in diameter around the center of the bin .",
    "this eliminated the trajectories that moved in and out of the bin but never crossed the center .",
    "for each selected trajectory , we determined the msd and averaged this over all the relevant trajectories .",
    "each individual msd was obtained by examining such a trajectory over 50,000 integration steps from its ` starting ' point . because we used a low temperature ( @xmath16 )",
    ", we were able to access the long - time diffusion regime without the particle traveling beyond the confines of the relevant bin , despite the long msd sampling length , see part i.  @xcite this is necessary , as the ahlrichs and dnweg coupling method  @xcite used to thermalize the raspberry particles , does not accurately reproduce the short - time diffusion that is present for a system that satisfies stokes equations for all times , see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in order to compare the quality of our results for the raspberry particles to reference curves",
    ", we utilized literature values from analytic and numerical studies whenever possible .",
    "however , for the sphere confined between two plates , literature results were often not available , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "therefore , we performed finite - element calculations using the comsol 4.4 multi - physics modeling software to establish reference data .",
    "we set up a system with a spherical colloid of radius @xmath17 @xmath18 m .",
    "the sphere was located on the symmetry axis of a cylindrical fluid domain of height @xmath0 , bounded on top and bottom by two no - slip plates ( the bases of the cylinder ) .",
    "the cylindrical domain was bounded on its side by open boundary conditions ( zero normal stress ) for the fluid .",
    "we solved stokes equations for an incompressible fluid with density @xmath19 kg@xmath20m@xmath21 and dynamic viscosity @xmath22 kg@xmath20m@xmath23s@xmath24 on this domain .    to determine the various mobilities we imposed the following boundary conditions on the sphere .",
    "we solved for the force and torque exerted by the fluid and plates on the sphere , to which we applied a constant ( angular ) velocity boundary condition , to obtain the translational and rotational mobility , respectively . to ensure that the laminar flow condition is satisfied , we used low values of the ( angular ) velocity of the sphere : @xmath25 m@xmath20s@xmath24 and @xmath26 s@xmath24",
    ". typically , we found reynolds numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we varied the position of the sphere with respect to the plates along the cylindrical domain s axis keeping the sphere s position fixed in the other directions to determine the @xmath2 dependence of the mobility .",
    "similarly , we examined the plate - separation dependence @xmath0 of the mobility by keeping the sphere fixed in the center of the cylinder and moving the plates outward .",
    "the diameter of the cylinder was varied to remove finite - size effects , but we found that a diameter of @xmath29 was sufficient to guarantee convergence .",
    "whenever possible , we exploited the rotational symmetry of the system to minimize the number of elements required , _",
    "i.e. _ , for perpendicular movement and rotation about an axis perpendicular to the wall .",
    "for the full three - dimensional ( 3d ) geometries , constructing a sufficiently refined mesh that contained a manageable number of elements proved difficult .",
    "we used local refinement with elements @xmath30 nm in size over the surface of the particle and in disks with radius @xmath31 on the bases of the cylinder around the cylinder s axis .",
    "the size of the elements was allowed to expand radially outward .",
    "we verified that integration over the surface yielded the surface area to within a fractional deviation of @xmath32 .",
    "we therefore expect that similar integration of the force and torque over the surface would show limited deviation between the true solution of the boundary value problem and our numerical result . to further demonstrate the quality of our approximate solution , we performed mesh refinement for a selected number of configurations and found no significant change .",
    "it should be noted that there is no direct correspondence between the values we employed in our finite - element calculations and the parameters used in our lb simulations , since we are interested in fitting our simulations to the behavior expected for the stokes flow solution .",
    "we used reduced units throughout for our comparison between the raspberry particle simulations and the comsol calculations , therefore any specific choice of the parameters is factored out .      in this section , we summarize the notations used throughout this manuscript .",

    "however , we can clearly see that there is structure to the fractional deviation @xmath52 between the two results in fig .",

    "that is , the data to which we fitted is a function of @xmath86 and we applied a root - finding algorithm to ensure that the fitted value for @xmath89 of @xmath90 and @xmath91 equals @xmath30 .",
    "we thus solved for the value @xmath86 .",
    "the above procedure , however , strongly favors the criterion imposed on the extrapolated data point , while it sacrifices overall matching to the finite - element calculations  which we assume to be more accurate .",
    "hence , there can be a systematic deviation between the two data sets , as is indeed found in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot_height](c ) .",
    "however , our fitting procedure is reasonable , since it does not implicitly assumes the finite - element data to be superior to that obtained using the raspberry model and it only uses internal fitting parameters .",
    "the agreement between the two results , despite the systematic deviations , can therefore be considered excellent .    from our numerical results",
    "we can formulate modified empirical forms for the rotational mobility s dependence on the channel height @xmath0 , for mid - channel rotation about an axis parallel and perpendicular to the walls .",

    "the @xmath86 obtained from the experiment ( @xmath53 ) with rotation about an axis perpendicular to the wall ( fig .",

    "therefore , the rotational data has a higher standard deviation in general , as taking the cubic root to establish the effective radius leads to stronger error propagation .    from our results",
    ", we conclude that the level of disagreement between the effective radii of the hollow raspberry model seems to be unaffected by the confinement . this can be seen from the excellent agreement ( in an absolute sense ) between the hydrodynamic radii in bulk and good relative agreement between our results and literature references in the confining geometry .",
    "we have also shown that our ` filling + fitting ' procedure for the raspberry model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) again significantly improves the agreement between the effective hydrodynamic radius obtained by translational and rotational experiments .",
    "there is correspondence between the effective radii that are found for the ` filling + fitting ' raspberry using the various experiments , within the numerical error .",
    "a similar conclusion can not be reached for the hollow raspberry , indicating that this model may be more sensitive to the details of its surroundings .",
    "finally , let us focus on the raspberry constructed using the ahlrichs and dnweg viscous coupling ( vc ) scheme  @xcite in the context of the other methods available to model the hydrodynamic interactions of colloids with each other and boundaries .",
    "there are several well - known alternatives to the method outlined in part i  @xcite and this manuscript , by which md objects can be coupled to lb , namely : ladd bounce - back boundaries ( ladd bb ) ,  @xcite the immersed boundary method ( ibm ) ,  @xcite and the external boundary force ( ebf ) method .",
    "@xcite there are other hydrodynamics solvers that can achieve similar colloid - in - fluid descriptions .",
    "most commonly used in physics are dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) ,  @xcite multi - particle collision dynamics ( mpcd ) or stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) ,  @xcite and stokesian dynamics ( sd ) .",
    "@xcite in the following we briefly discuss our method in the context of these alternatives .",
    "it was recently shown by schiller  @xcite that vc is a general description for fluid - particle coupling , which encompasses both ibm and ebf .",
    "ibm and ebf correspond to special choices of the friction and mass ratio in vc . as such , for the lb - based descriptions it suffices to consider ladd bb .",
    "one point of interest is that the ebf method can be modified to lead to an instantaneous no - slip boundary condition , but only at the expense of loosing freedom in the choice of the bare friction coefficient .",
    "@xcite    ladd bb employs the grid on which the lb fluid is simulated to describe the particles .",
    "@xcite this gives ladd bb an advantage over the vc raspberry model , as it does not necessitate an interpolation step or sub - lattice refinement to achieve the fluid - particle coupling .",
    "similar to the vc raspberry particle , ladd bb also gives rise to an effective hydrodynamic radius , for which can be fitted .",
    "however , ladd bb achieves a no - slip boundary condition , without necessitating a particular choice of the bare friction coefficient .",
    "this is favorable , as there is no question of porosity .",
    "@xcite it is therefore likely that ladd bb performs better in force and velocity experiments of part i ,  @xcite as no counter - force can be applied to the nodes which are encompassed by the ladd bb particle , leading to an effective ( reduced ) force being applied to the particle .",
    "finally , there are lubrication corrections available for the ladd bb method .",
    "@xcite these should improve the near - field interactions between particles and particles and walls , compared to the vc raspberry method .    considering these advantages",
    "ladd bb would seem the method of choice .",
    "however , the grid - based description of the particle in ladd bb is known to suffer when there are too few grid points inside the particle . for example , to obtain a coupling shape that is sufficiently spherical , a radius of @xmath138 is required .",
    "we have shown that the vc raspberry can be used for smaller @xmath31 and the vc has been shown to work well even for single coupling points .",
    "@xcite this is useful in systems where one is restricted in the number of lb nodes that one can use  in particular graphics processor unit ( gpu)-based lb codes are limited by the amount of ram available on the gpu .",
    "vc allowes one to study large systems with many thousands of particles , without the need to fully resolve each on the lattice , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the non - lb methods to achieve fluid - colloid coupling vary considerably in the way that this coupling is achieved .",
    "dpd , mpcd , and srd ( the latter two essentially being the same ) , all achieve coupling to the ` fluid ' by interacting with the particles that comprise it . for mpcd and srd ,",
    "the smallest length scale on which the larger raspberry object can be resolved is governed by the size of the fluid particles , rather than the boxes that are used in the collision step .",
    "this could well be advantageous in modeling small separations of walls and raspberries .",
    "however , it should be noted that a sufficient density of mpcd particles must be present to properly model hydrodynamic interactions , which would be problematic for situations in which the raspberries are in proximity to each other and obstacles . in dpd , however , the finest features of the raspberry that can be resolved have the typical length scale of the solvent particle interactions . as such , dpd is typically a coarser method than both the vc in lb and mpcd and is more likely to encounter problems for small raspberry - raspberry and raspberry - wall separations .",
    "finally , there is the method of sd ,  @xcite in which the hydrodynamic interactions between particles are described using the rotne - prager tensor .",
    "this method a suited for bulk systems , but it can be modified to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "its main attraction is the fact that it solves stokes equations exactly for dilute systems and that it can be modified to include a lubrication correction .",
    "this together with the algorithm s favorable scaling  @xcite give it a slight edge over the vc method for bulk systems .",
    "however , simple ( closed ) analytic forms for the rotne - prager tensor are not available for more complicated geometries  not even for two plates . only for single plates",
    "can one use the blake - tensor formalism .",
    "therefore , any advantage of the sd algorithm in bulk ( with or without lubrication corrections ) is lost in more complicated geometries , since the quality of the solution sensitively depends on the approximations made for the hydrodynamic interaction tensors .",
    "a full comparison of the various methods goes beyond the scope of the current research , but is certainly worthwhile for future study .",
    "summarizing , we have examined the properties of the raspberry model using a classic fluid dynamics experiments , wherein a sphere is subjected to the confining geometry of parallel plates .",
    "this so - called ` raspberry ' model refers to a hybrid lattice - boltzmann ( lb ) and langevin molecular dynamics ( md ) scheme for simulating the dynamics of suspensions of colloids originally developed by lobaskin and dnweg .",
    "@xcite the particle is represented by a set of points on its surface that couple to the fluid through a frictional force acting both on the solvent and on the solute , which depends on the relative velocity .",
    "we began our investigation by analyzing the position dependent translational mobility of a sphere moving perpendicular to the two plates .",
    "we found excellent agreement with the predictions of refs .",
    "this was extended upon by considering the parallel translational mobility of the sphere . here , we found good agreement with the result by faxen  @xcite in the limit of large plate separation .",
    "we improved upon faxen s result by proposing a modified , empirical expression that works well over the entire range of plate separations .",
    "finally , we considered the rotational mobility for rotation about axes parallel and perpendicular to the plates .",
    "for these systems no analytic expressions were available to which we could compare our numerical results .",
    "however , on the basis of our numerical results , we were able to formulate expressions for these mobility coefficients for spheres fixed in the center of the plates as a function of the plate separation .",
    "our results show that stokesian hydrodynamic behavior is reproduced by our raspberry model with the ` filling + fitting ' formalism to a surprising degree of accuracy over a wide range of length scales . from our combined data",
    "we can draw the following additional conclusions concerning our ` filling + fitting ' procedure and the raspberry point - coupling method in general :    * to determine the bulk translational mobility of a particle , a force or velocity experiment performed in the center of two plates is more suitable than in a simple - cubic geometry .",
    "this type of experiment does not have the disadvantage of a back force / velocity density ,  @xcite which could interfere with the fitting procedure required to extrapolate results to bulk ( infinite plate separation ) . *",
    "the raspberry point - coupling can be combined with confining geometries consisting of bounce - back boundary conditions .",
    "the combination yields accurate results over a large range of particle - boundary separations , up to roughly one lb lattice spacing ; as verified for the specific geometry of two parallel plates . *",
    "we estimate the raspberry to accurately reproduce hydrodynamics interactions for particle - particle and particle - surface separations greater than one lb lattice spacing .",
    "the separation is determined by the effective radii . here ,",
    "we consider the results of our rotational mobility experiments and translational mobility experiments in confinement significant , as there are no back - torques or back - forces applied to the fluid .",
    "@xcite    the latter estimate is not unreasonable , since the near - field effects of discretizing the surface into a finite number of md beads become noticeable at comparable separations .",
    "there are , however , two caveats to the last result .",
    "( i ) we have not verified that we obtain the correct behavior in a system with many particles that can undergo collision events . here",
    ", we only extrapolate our particle - image results  @xcite to particle - particle interactions .",
    "this point is left for future study .",
    "( ii ) in the case of a rotating raspberry , for which we observed that the particle - image interactions are correct up to one lattice spacing , the motion and structure of the raspberry are such that the fluid is constantly exposed to different fluid - coupling points ( the md beads ) .",
    "this may remove artifacts caused by the discretization of the surface ( or volume ) that are more noticeable in the translational experiment , where the orientation is fixed .    from the above and our examination in part i  @xcite , it becomes clear that our ` filling + fitting ' procedure for the raspberry model is an excellent way to approximate fluid - particle coupling in a stokes liquid , using an lb algorithm .",
