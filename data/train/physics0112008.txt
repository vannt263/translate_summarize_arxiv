    "the dynamics of a molecule moving within a bulk superfluid medium are not expected to be too different from its dynamics in vacuum . like the vacuum ,",
    "an unbounded fluid is homogeneous and invariant with respect to continuous translations and rotations .",
    "moreover , in the exotic case of superfluids , the very low level of excitation achieved at low temperatures implies that there is a vanishing set of modes with which the immersed molecule can interact .",
    "these expectations are borne out in the spectroscopy of single impurity molecules in @xmath3he nanodroplets , where the superfluid medium has little effect on the rotational spectrum beyond modifying the molecular moments of inertia  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a low temperature superfluid medium is distinct from the nonrelativistic vacuum in that it lacks a basic symmetry : galilean invariance .",
    "the superfluid condensate defines a preferred rest frame , an  ether \" relative to which molecular velocities should be measured .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the energy - momentum relationship of molecules immersed in superfluids can deviate from a parabolic form .",
    "of more interest spectroscopically , the presence of a preferred rest frame also gives rise to the possibility of couplings between linear and angular momenta that are strictly forbidden in an environment with galilean invariance .",
    "evidence of such couplings would provide one of the most direct experimental signatures of the superfluid medium .",
    "this paper develops a simple and general theoretical framework for the rigid - body dynamics of a molecule immersed in a bosonic superfluid .",
    "the classical analysis of an immersed body , presented in section [ sec1 ] , shows that an incompressible fluid medium adds 11 parameters to the usual 4 parameters characterizing a free rigid body . as a result ,",
    "an immersed body is typically chaotic .",
    "the classical model is quantized in section [ sec2 ] , and the quantum hamiltonian is discussed .",
    "the most interesting new feature is a term of the form @xmath4 which directly couples the linear momentum of the molecule to its angular momentum .",
    "this coupling requires chirality in the molecule , and corresponds intuitively to the action of a propeller .",
    "it fully lifts the usual @xmath5-fold degeneracy of rigid - rotor states with angular momentum @xmath6 , providing a clear spectroscopic signature of the superfluid - induced rotational - translational coupling .",
    "an unusual consequence is that the ground state acquires nonzero linear momentum . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the magnitude of the rotational - translational coupling is estimated for the chiral molecules hooh and foof .",
    "the predicted splitting of rotational absorption lines , at least for hooh , is comparable to the resolution of current experiments .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] , the results are discussed in the context of related work .",
    "we consider a rigid body immersed in unbounded , incompressible fluid of uniform density @xmath7 .",
    "the body occupies a bounded , simply - connected volume @xmath8 from which the fluid is excluded ; the surface of this volume is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the velocity of the fluid is described by a potential @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 , which satisfies @xmath12 inside the fluid volume and @xmath13 as @xmath14 . on the moving surface @xmath9 ,",
    "the fluid velocity also must satisfy @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the surface normal and @xmath17 is the surface velocity .",
    "our goal is to obtain a classical hamiltonian for the immersed body which can be readily quantized .",
    "the classical problem is treated in many hydrodynamics texts ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , to which we refer the reader desiring greater detail .",
    "we first choose an origin and coordinate axes fixed in the body ; this defines the body frame .",
    "the origin of the body frame is at @xmath18 in the lab frame , and the body axes are rotated by @xmath19 from the lab axes .",
    "the three components of @xmath18 and the three euler angles needed to parametrize the matrix @xmath19 completely specify the position of the body . when @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the body and lab frames coincide , and the body is said to be in the reference position .",
    "let @xmath22 be the euclidean transformation which moves the body from the reference position to its position at time @xmath23 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath24 the time - dependence of @xmath8 is simply @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a fixed volume ; similarly , @xmath27 .",
    "the lab - frame velocity of a point @xmath28 , which is fixed in the body , is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the body s angular velocity .",
    "the velocity potential at a point @xmath31 which is fixed in the body frame , @xmath32 , satisfies fairly simple equations : @xmath33 outside @xmath26 , @xmath34 as @xmath14 , and @xmath35 for @xmath31 on the fixed surface @xmath36 , where the surface velocity was calculated using eq .",
    "( [ ptvelocity ] ) .",
    "indeed , the equations for @xmath37 are linear , with inhomogeneous boundary conditions linear in @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the velocity potential can therefore be expressed as a linear combination , @xmath40 where the harmonic functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 satisfy    @xmath43    on @xmath36 .",
    "these six functions characterize the fluid response to the six independent motions of the body ; they depend only on the shape of @xmath36 .    for a free rigid body ,",
    "the lagrangian is just the kinetic energy .",
    "when the body is immersed , this is augmented by the kinetic energy of the fluid : @xmath44 where the second integral is over the fluid volume @xmath45 , the complement of the body volume @xmath26 .",

    "there are @xmath58 parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "we can place the body origin at a conveniently chosen point in the body , reducing this to 18 .",
    "we can then rotate the body axes with respect to the body , leaving 15 . by comparison",
    ", the free rigid rotor has 4 parameters .",
    "the classical hamiltonian follows from the lagrangian [ eq .  ( [ fulll ] ) ] : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the linear momentum , canonically conjugate to @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the angular momentum in the lab frame .",

    ", we restrict the hamiltonian to a reduced phase space ; the equations of motion for the remaining degrees of freedom are unchanged by the reduction . in this case , the original six degrees of freedom are reduced to two , so the reduced phase space is four - dimensional .",

    "the energy shells of the reduced phase space ( i.e. , the level sets of @xmath105 ) are three - dimensional .",
    "the integrability of a hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom can be ascertained using a poincar section , essentially by inspection .",
    "to illustrate that the immersed rigid body is generally chaotic , we display a poincar section of the reduced phase space in fig .",

    "therefore , while allowing a nonuniform fluid density may alter our results , it is difficult to predict the outcome without performing a full calculation .    by studying the dynamics of immersed molecules in bulk superfluid , we have ignored the finite - size effects associated with immersion in a cluster or droplet .",
    "our approach can be extended to handle reasonably large droplets with no fundamental difficulties .",
    "lehmann has carried out a related calculation for the case of a linear molecule in a spherical droplet , taking into account the hydrodynamic effects which are present for an elliptical molecular surface ( the modification of the rotational constants and the @xmath69 matrix , in our notation ) , together with the effective interactions between the molecule and the droplet surface  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the current work along similar lines .",
    "we expect that such an extension would lead to results qualitatively similar to those presented here .",
    "because parity is a good symmetry for a superfluid droplet , as it is for bulk superfluid , parity would still be broken by the addition of a chiral impurity molecule , and this would manifest itself in a characteristic splitting of the rotational spectrum .",
    "microscopic details of the superfluid structure are also neglected by a continuum hydrodynamic approach .",
    "these details are better treated by path - integral and diffusion monte carlo methods , which have proven successful in predicting the rotational constants of immersed molecules  @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the hydrodynamic mass and rotational - translational tensors described here can also be extracted from such calculations , and this information would be a useful complement to the hydrodynamic results .",
    "monte carlo methods could also be used to address another neglected phenomenon : the quantum - mechanical tunnelling between left - handed and right - handed forms of a chiral molecule .",
    "this may play a pronounced role in hydrogen peroxide , where the torsional ground state ( a symmetric superposition of left- and right - handed forms ) is @xmath247@xmath2 below the first ( antisymmetric ) excited state  @xcite . because the splitting is so large , comparable even to the rotational level spacing , the enantiomers are strongly mixed , making questionable our rigid - body treatment of the molecule .",
    "we expect the surrounding superfluid to suppress tunnelling , but a detailed calculation , without the assumption of rigidity , is needed for a quantitative assessment .",
    "( some experimental support is provided by the work of nauta and miller , who studied immersed hf dimers ; they found that the barrier to interchange tunnelling was raised significantly by the presence of the superfluid  @xcite . )",
    "the main difficulty in applying monte carlo methods would be finite - size effects : since translational symmetry is strongly broken in small droplets , while rotational symmetry is preserved , the finite - size corrections to @xmath47 and @xmath48 are presumably more drastic than those to @xmath49 .",
    "a number of other microscopic techniques have been applied to molecular impurities in superfluid droplets ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , such as density functional theory , and these more elaborate methods may also be applicable to the phenomena we have described .",
    "finally , experimental data would be extraordinarily useful in refining the current model .",
    "the spectroscopic signatures we have described should be present for any chiral molecule , but not all candidate molecules will have the large splitting constants necessary to resolve the fine structure .",
    "nanodroplet experiments have been conducted using many different species of impurity molecule ; ref .",
    "@xcite contains an exhaustive list .",
    "however , almost none of the studied molecules are chiral , so it is not surprising that no quantum propeller has yet been seen .",
    "we have suggested hydrogen peroxide ( hooh ) as one strong candidate .",
    "ideally , the present paper will provide sufficient impetus for more detailed investigations , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "this work was funded by a department of education gaann fellowship , no .",
    "for approximately spherical surfaces , it is possible to calculate the hydrodynamic mass , rotational - translational coupling , and inertia tensors as perturbation series in the deviation from sphericity . consider a surface at @xmath192 .",
    "the surface normal times the area element is @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the usual vector of first - order differential operators on the sphere . for any scalar function @xmath250 , @xmath251 with derivatives evaluated at @xmath252 . applying this to eq .",
    "( [ eq : psieqn ] ) for the translational response function @xmath41 yields @xmath253 where @xmath254 , and with derivatives evaluated at @xmath252 . if @xmath41 is expanded in orders of @xmath194 , as @xmath255 , and functions evaluated at @xmath189",
    "are expanded in taylor series around @xmath210 , then eq .",
    "( [ psieqn ] ) gives a single equation at each order in @xmath194 :      and so forth , where now all derivatives are evaluated at @xmath257 .",
    "moreover , @xmath258 and @xmath259 as @xmath260 for each @xmath261 . the zeroth - order equation can be solved for @xmath262 , and in general the equation of order @xmath263 can be solved for @xmath264 once all the @xmath265 with @xmath266 are known .",
    "therefore @xmath41 can be calculated to any order in @xmath194 , though the process rapidly becomes tedious .",
    "similarly , the rotational response function @xmath42 satisfies the simpler equation @xmath267 at @xmath252 , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rotfnceqn ] ) ; and this can be used to find @xmath42 to any order in @xmath194 , in exactly the same way",
    ".    once the response functions are in hand , eqs .",
    "( [ eqs : fluidtensors ] ) can be evaluated to obtain the fluid tensors .",
    "this , too , is done order - by - order in @xmath194 .",
    "the results are best expressed as angular averages . through second order in @xmath194 ,      where @xmath269 , and functions are evaluated at @xmath210 . here the first - order fields @xmath270 and @xmath271 are determined by their radial derivatives at @xmath210 , which are @xmath272 note that @xmath273 is antisymmetric to first order . because the antisymmetric part of @xmath48 is eliminated by the correct choice of body origin , it was necessary to carry the calculation of @xmath273 to second order to obtain nontrivial rotational - translational coupling ."
