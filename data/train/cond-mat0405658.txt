    "the velocity field of a superfluid is irrotational . as a result , such fluids develop vortex states when rotated , and the circulation of the superfluid velocity around any closed path is quantized @xcite .",
    "trapped bose - einstein condensates of alkali - metal atoms provide ideal systems for testing these ideas .",
    "remarkably , they permit experimentalists not only to vary the form of the trapping potential but also to change the sign of the scattering length associated with the effective atom - atom interaction .    in a harmonic trap , vortices in bose - einstein condensates with repulsive interactions are always singly - quantized @xcite . if , however , the effective interaction is attractive or the trapping potential has a different shape @xcite , the situation can change dramatically .",
    "the recent experiment of ref.@xcite investigated the behavior under rotation of an effectively repulsive bose - einstein condensate confined in an anharmonic trap .",
    "as shown in the theoretical studies of refs.@xcite , vortices can be multiply quantized in any trap that grows faster than quadratically .",
    "further , refs.@xcite have demonstrated that the angular momentum is carried by center - of - mass motion in an effectively - attractive condensate that rotates in a harmonic trap .    in this study",
    "we investigate the phase diagram of an anharmonically - trapped bose gas in the case of an effective attractive atomic interaction as a function of the rotation frequency of the trap and of the strength of the dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total number of atoms , @xmath2 is the s - wave scattering length , and @xmath3 is height of the gas along the rotation axis . both the sign and the magnitude of the scattering length can be adjusted using feshbach resonances .",
    "the magnitude of the coupling constant can also be controlled by changing either the number of atoms in the trap or the trap frequencies . for sufficiently strong attractive interactions ,",
    "such systems are unstable against collapse @xcite .",
    "however , as long as the interaction is balanced by the zero - point motion of the atoms in the trap ( and also by the kinetic energy associated with the vortices in the case of a rotating gas ) , the gas can exist in a metastable state .    in discussing the effects of rotation on the metastability of a gas with attractive interactions",
    "we must distinguish two physical situations , whether the trap is being rotated at a given angular frequency  the principal case we consider here  or whether the gas is set into rotation , and then the rotation of the trap is switched off .",
    "the former case , the analog of the meissner effect in superconductors , examines the equilibrium states of the system in the presence of rotation .",
    "the latter examines the metastability of supercurrents in the absence of a driving force . as stressed by leggett @xcite ,",
    "superfluid flow in a system with effectively attractive interactions is not stable in the absence of external rotation .",
    "thus the rotating states that we find here to be metastable in a rotating trap should lose angular momentum and cease rotating once the rotation of the trap is switched off .",
    "the details of how the angular momentum associated with superfluid flow in such systems is lost is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "examples of the breakup of a vortex are given in refs .",
    "angular momentum can also be continuously taken out of the flow through interaction of the flow with normal fluid .",
    "anharmonic traps allow a rich structure of three phases depending on the strength of the attractive interactions and on the rotational frequency .",
    "the first is an unstable phase in which the gas collapses to a more dense state .",
    "the second phase is characterized by the angular momentum being carried by the motion of the center of mass .",
    "the third phase involves either a mixed state of multiply and singly quantized vortices or a pure state of multiple quantization .",

    "it is crucial that the trap be anharmonic to have such a structure . in a harmonic trap ,",
    "repulsive interactions ensure that the critical frequency for rotation is smaller than the trap frequency and thus permit the formation of vortices @xcite .",
