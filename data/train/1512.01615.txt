    "congruence is a fundamental concept in number theory .",
    "two integers @xmath0 and @xmath1 are said to be congruent modulo a positive integer @xmath2 if their difference @xmath3 is integrally divisible by @xmath2 , written as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "congruence theory has been widely used in physics , biology , chemistry , computer science , and even music and business  @xcite . because of the limited computational and storage ability of computers , congruence arithmetic is particularly useful and applicable to computing with numbers of infinite length  @xcite .",
    "significant and representative applications include generating random numbers  @xcite , designing hash functions  @xcite and checksumming in error detections  @xcite . as a cornerstone of modern cryptography ,",
    "congruence arithmetic has been successfully used in public - key encryption  @xcite , secret sharing  @xcite , digital authentication , and many other data security applications  @xcite .    despite the well - established congruence theory with a broad spectrum of applications , a comprehensive understanding of the congruence relation among natural numbers is still lacking .",
    "our purpose is to uncover some intrinsic properties of the network consisting of natural numbers with congruence relations .",
    "a link in the congruence network is defined in terms of the congruence relation @xmath5 , where @xmath1 is the reminder of @xmath6 divided by @xmath7 . for a fixed value of @xmath1",

    "a directed link from @xmath7 to @xmath6 ( suppose @xmath9 ) characterizes the congruence relation between @xmath7 and @xmath6 , giving rise to a congruence network for a given reminder @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote a congruence network , where @xmath11 is the largest integer considered .",
    "note that congruence networks associated with different values of @xmath1 share the same set of nodes ( integers ) , thereby a multiplex network @xcite with a number of layers is formed , as shown in fig .",

    "we will demonstrate several unique and prominent properties of the mcn regarding some typical dynamical processes .",
    "specifically , analytical results will show that all layers of the mcn are sparse with the same power - law degree distribution .",
    "a counterintuitive property of the mcn is that every layer of the mcn has an extremely strong controllability , which significantly differs from ordinary scale - free networks requiring a large fraction of driver nodes . to steer the network in a layer , the minimum number of driver nodes is nothing but the reminder @xmath1 that is negligible as compared to the network size .",
    "the controllability of the mcn is also very robust against targeted removal of nodes but relatively vulnerable to random failures , which is also in sharp contrast to ordinary scale - free networks .",

    "the mcn therefore sheds light on the design of heterogeneous networks with high searching efficiency  @xcite and strong controllability simultaneously .",
    "one of the most important applications of the mcn is that it allows to solve the simultaneous congruences problem in a much more efficient way than existing methods using the gauss algorithm . to tackle the problem with high computational efficiency",
    ", the network of each layer should be stored in advance , e.g. , in a distributed storage system .",
    "the solution of the simultaneous congruences problem is to locate common neighbors of relevant numbers in different layers .",
    "this new efficient approach by virtue of the mcn offers deeper and broader insight into the modern cryptography and has potential applications in many other fields , such as communications and computer science .",
    "mcn consists of a number of congrence networks ( layers ) @xmath12 , as shown in fig .  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "each layer contains all the natural numbers larger than @xmath1 but less than or equal to @xmath11 , so the size ( number of nodes ) of a layer is @xmath13 .",
    "the remainder @xmath1 is a parameter that determines the structure of congruence network .",
    "when @xmath14 , the congruence network reduces to a divisibility network  @xcite , in which the dividend links to all of its divisors except itself .",
    "the out - degrees of nodes are heterogeneous in each layer of the mcn .",
    "we have analytically derived the distribution of the out - degrees in the thermodynamic limit ( see details in the section of * methods * ) : @xmath15 for large @xmath16 , the out - degree distribution becomes @xmath17 , thus @xmath10 is a typical scale - free network .",
    "all @xmath12 have similar out - degree distributions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , but the divisibility network @xmath18 has a different out - degree distribution . for small @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath19 of @xmath18 deviates from the other networks @xmath12 .",
    "the main factor that accounts for the difference lies in that half of the nodes in @xmath18 have no outgoing links , but in @xmath12 there are only @xmath1 nodes without outgoing links .",
    "analytical results demonstrate that the average degree of any layer increases logarithmically with the network size ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and the section of * methods * for details ) , and a larger value of @xmath1 corresponds to a sparser layer .",
    "these results indicate that @xmath10 is always a sparse network .",
    "hence , the mcn is compatible with a sparse storage , which is important for applying the mcn to solve real - world problems .",
    "according to the definition of mcn , the numbers in each layer @xmath20 can be classified into @xmath1 arithmetic sequences : @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 denotes the largest integer not greater than @xmath24 ) .",
    "the consecutive numbers in the sequence are linked from small to large , resulting in @xmath1 chains traversing all nodes in a layer , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "the root node of a chain is the minimum number in the chain .",
    "there are totally @xmath1 root nodes associated with @xmath1 chains .",
    "the end of a chain is always the maximum number in the chain .",
    "note that @xmath14 is a special case , because the arithmetic sequence does not exist in the layer @xmath18 , rendering the absence of the multi - chain structure in the divisibility network .",
    "the above results indicate that although the divisibility network @xmath18 is a special case of @xmath10 , it has some fundamental differences from @xmath12 .",
    "only when @xmath25 the multi - chain structure emerges , and the number of nodes without outgoing links is negligible . some evidence has suggested that the multi - chain structure and the absence of nodes with low out - degrees play an important role in the controllability of complex networks @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we will further investigate the controllability properties of the mcn .      in principle , the mcn composed of natural numbers is not a dynamical system , such that it can not be controlled .",
    "however , because of the multi - chain structure , the mcn provides significant insight into the design of heterogeneous networked systems with strong controllability .",
    "thus , we treat the mcn as a dynamical system and explore its unique and outstanding controllability properties .",
    "the central problem of controlling complex networks is to discern a minimum set of driver nodes , on which external input signals are imposed to fully control the whole system .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the minimum number of driver nodes and @xmath27 denote the fraction of driver nodes in a network .",
    "in general , a network with a smaller value of @xmath27 is said to be more controllable .    according to the exact controllability theory for complex networks  @xcite and the sparsity of mcn",
    ", we can prove that ( see in the section of * methods * ) @xmath28 and @xmath29 for large @xmath11 ( namely @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 and @xmath12 is considered as highly controllable .",
    "furthermore , according to both the exact controllability theory  @xcite and the structural controllability theory  @xcite , the driver nodes are the @xmath1 root nodes of the chains in @xmath12 ( see details in the section of * methods * ) . meanwhile , the driver nodes are the hub nodes with the maximum degree . in comparison , due to",
    "the absence of chains , the divisibility network @xmath18 with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 denotes the smallest integer not less than @xmath24 ) is hard to control for large @xmath11 .",
    "it has been recognized that scale - free networks are often difficult to control @xcite . in particular , liu et al .",
    "@xcite have analytically found that when the network size @xmath34 , one must control almost all nodes in order to fully control a scale - free network with scaling index @xmath35 .",
    "the mcn is a scale - free network with scaling exponent @xmath36 , but one just needs to control @xmath1 root nodes to achieve full control .",
    "such a strong controllability stems from the inherent multi - chain structure in mcn . from the perspective of structural controllability ,",
    "all nodes in the chains in mcn are matched except the @xmath1 roots , which need to be controlled .",
    "thus , the mcn is valuable for designing heterogeneous networks with strong controllability .",
    "we also found that the mcn is strongly structurally controllable ( ssc ) because of the multi - chain structure ( see * methods * ) , which provides significant insight into the design of heterogeneous and controllable networks without exact link weights .",
    "a network is said to be ssc if and only if its controllability will not be affected by the link weights in its adjacency matrix  @xcite , or equivalently , for any distribution of link weights , the network will be fully controllable from the same set of driver nodes .",
    "the ssc property implies that the mcn is robust against the fluctuation and uncertainty of link weights .",
    "this is an outstanding feature with practical significance since sometimes link weights are hard to be exactly measured and they are sometimes time - varying in real situations .",
    "the robustness against attacks is also a significant problem for the design of a controllable networked system  @xcite .",
    "we explore the robustness of the controllability of the mcn against attacks on nodes and find some unique properties , which is useful for the design of practical networks . on the one hand , due to the existence of chains rooted in @xmath1 driver nodes in mcn , targeted attacks to driver nodes will not destroy the multi - chain structure nor increase @xmath27 . here",
    ", nodes critical for targeted attacks can be identified based on the rank of node degrees or their hierarchical structure  @xcite . in mcn , driver nodes ( the @xmath1 root nodes )",
    "become such critical nodes . in this",
    "regard , mcn is robust against targeted attacks . on the other hand , random attacks to nodes",
    "may cut some chains . as a result",
    ", an additional driver is required to control each new breakpoint , leading to an increase of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the controllability of mcn is unusual in resisting attacks in the sense that it is robust against intentional attacks but vulnerable to random attacks , which significantly differs from general scale - free networks .",
    "the results in comparing the mcn and sf networks generated by using static model  @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . to make an unbiased comparison , a scale - free network with the same scaling exponent @xmath37 and @xmath38 as the mcn is necessary .",
    "however , because of the graphicality constraint , it is not possible to generate a random sf network with @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "thus , we slightly release the requirement by using static model to generate sf networks with the same @xmath38 but with @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , one can see that @xmath27 remains nearly unchanged under targeted attacks to driver nodes ; whereas random attacks to node causes clear increase of @xmath27 . this phenomenon is consistent with our analysis in terms of the multi - chain structure .",
    "moreover , for the presence of random attacks , in a wide range of the fractions of failed nodes , the controllability of mcn is still better than sf networks in general .",
    "one of the applications of mcn is that one can graphically solve the simultaneous congruences problem , which has implication in communication security and computer science . in particular",
    ", one can find that mcn is exactly a topological representation of the system of simultaneous congruences  @xcite .",
    "a system of simultaneous congruences is a set of congruence equations : @xmath41 if the moduli @xmath42 are pairwise coprime , then a unique solution modulo @xmath43 exists .",
    "this is the _",
    "chinese remainder theorem _ ( crt ) , which has many applications in computing , coding and cryptography @xcite . a well - known algorithm to solve the simultaneous congruences in crt is the gaussian algorithm @xcite , also known as _",
    "@xcite in ancient china . here , we present an intuitive approach based on mcn to solve the simultaneous congruences in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sim ] ) .",
    "firstly , we construct an mcn containing @xmath16 subnetworks with remainders @xmath44 , respectively . to focus on the minimum solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sim ] ) , we set the maximum number in the network as @xmath45 .",
    "then , we find the common successor neighbor of the nodes @xmath42 in this mcn , which is precisely the solution @xmath24 .",
    "we use a well - known example of crt , recorded in _ sunzi suanjing _",
    "@xcite , to demonstrate our approach .",
    "the problem in this example is : ` suppose we have an unknown number of objects . when grouped in threes , 2",
    "are left out , when grouped in fives , 3 are left out , and when grouped in sevens , 2 are left out .",
    "how many objects are there ? '",
    "this problem is equivalent to the following simultaneous congruences @xmath46 to solve the problem , we first construct an mcn of two layers , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , as shown in fig .",
    "then , we find the common successor neighbor of the three moduli , 3 , 5 and 7 , and finally get the result @xmath49 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the traditional algorithm for solving the simultaneous congruences problem , e.g. , the garner s algorithm @xcite , is more efficient than our algorithm based on the mcn that is essentially a brute - force search .",
    "thus , it is infeasible to immediately use the graphical approach in data security .",
    "however , the graphical algorithm offers new routes to the simultaneous congruences problem in the viewpoint of a complex network , which may be useful to improve the currently used algorithm .",
    "is @xmath50 , and similarly @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the lower layer .",
    "thus the common successor neighbor of the three nodes is @xmath53 , which is the solution of the simultaneous congruences problem described by in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sz]).,width=340 ]",
    "we have defined a multiplex congruence network composed of natural numbers and uncovered its unique topological features .",
    "analytical results demonstrate that every layer of the multiplex network is a sparse and scale - free subnetwork with the same degree distribution .",
    "counterintuitively , every layer with a scale - free structure has an extremely strong controllability , which significantly differs from ordinary scale - free networks . in general , a scale - free network with power - law degree distribution is harder to control than homogeneous networks .",
    "this is attributed to the presence of hub nodes , at which dilation arises according to the structural control theory @xcite . as a result ,",
    "downstream neighbor nodes of hubs are difficult to control . moreover , due to a large number of nodes connecting to hubs , scale - free networks are usually of weak controllability with a large fraction of driver nodes . in contrast , in spite of the scale - free structure of the congruence network , the long chains in each layer considerably inhibit dilation and reduce the number driver nodes .",
    "furthermore , an interesting finding is that every layer is also strong structurally controllable in that link weights have no effect on the controllability .",
    "this indicates that the controllability of the multiplex congruence network is extremely robust against the inherent limit to precisely accessing link weights in the real situation . to our knowledge ,",
    "a scale - free network with strong structural controllability has not been reported prior to our congruence network .",
    "an unusual controllability property is that the controllability of each layer is robust against targeted attacks to driver nodes , but relatively fragile to random failures of nodes , which is also different from common scale - free networks .",
    "previously reported results @xcite demonstrate that targeted removal of high degree nodes and nodes in the top level of a hierarchical structure causes maximum damage to the network controllability .",
    "under the two kinds of intentional removals , a network is easier to break to pieces , such that more driver nodes are required to achieve full control .",
    "thus , targeted attacks are defined in terms of the two types of node removals . in the congruence network ,",
    "high degree nodes and high level nodes are exactly identical , leading to the combination of the targeted attacks . strikingly , the congruence network is robust against the targeted attacks , because of the existence of the chains .",
    "targeted attacks will not destroy the chains in the downstream of the attacked node . as a result , the number of driver nodes nearly does not increase , even when a large fraction of nodes has been targeted attacked .",
    "the outstanding structural and controllability properties of the multiplex congruence network are valuable for designing heterogeneous networks with strong controllability and high searching efficiency rooted in the scale - free structure .",
    "another application of the multiplex congruent network is to solve the simultaneous congruences problem in a graphical and intuitive manner .",
    "the multiplex congruence network by converting the algebraic problem of solving simultaneous congruences equations to be a graphical problem of finding common neighbors in a graph , offers an alternative route to the traditional approaches . despite this property , the traditional algorithms , such as gaussian algorithm and",
    "garner s algorithm , outperform the graphical method in computational efficiency .",
    "hence , the graphical method is not applicable in data security at the present .",
    "nevertheless , the graphical approach may inspire the combination of the graphical and algebraic method to improve the current algorithm , which is potentially valuable in communication security , computer science and many fields relevant to cryptography .",
    "our work may also stimulate further effort toward studying of networks arising from natural relationships among numbers , with outstanding features and applied values .",
    "many topological insights can be expected from complex networks consisting of natural numbers .",
    "for a sub - network @xmath12 in mcn , the total number of nodes is @xmath13 and the number of nodes without out - links is @xmath1 .",
    "the out - degree of a node labelled @xmath2 in the range of @xmath54 $ ] is 1 , because node @xmath2 can only link to one node i.e. node @xmath55 in the network ; similarly , the out - degree of a node labelled @xmath2 in the range of @xmath56 $ ] is 2 , because node @xmath2 can only link to two nodes i.e. nodes @xmath55 and @xmath57 ; similar scenarios appear to the other nodes .",
    "thus , we can derive the distribution of out - degrees in the thermodynamic limit , as follows : @xmath58    in @xmath18 , the numbers larger than @xmath59 have no out - links , i.e. @xmath60 , and the numbers in the range of @xmath61 $ ] have only one out - link , i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "analogously , as @xmath63 , @xmath64 this is the same as the in - degree distribution of a growing network with copying  @xcite , which can be regarded as a random version of the divisibility network  @xcite .",
    "note that the minimum number @xmath65 in @xmath12 has the maximum out - degree @xmath66 and the second minimum number @xmath67 has the out - degree @xmath68 , and so on .",
    "thus , the average degree @xmath69 of @xmath12 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the euler constant and @xmath72 is a constant , which is approximately @xmath73 when @xmath1 is very large .",
    "( [ eq : av ] ) is not valid for the divisibility network @xmath18 . in @xmath18",
    ", number 1 has the maximum out - degree @xmath74 , and 2 has the second maximum out - degree @xmath75 , and so on . in a similar way to eq .",
    "( [ eq : av ] ) , we can obtain the average degree of @xmath18 , as @xmath76 which is consistent with the analytical results of the undirected divisibility network @xcite .",
    "an arbitrary network with linear time - invariant dynamics under control can be described by @xmath77 where the vector @xmath78 stands for the states of @xmath11 nodes , @xmath79 denotes the coupling matrix ( transpose of the adjacency matrix ) of a network , @xmath80 is the vector of @xmath2 input signals , and @xmath81 is the input matrix .    system ( [ eq : ct ] ) is said to be ( state ) controllable if the input signal @xmath82 imposed on a minimum number @xmath26 of driver nodes specified by control matrix @xmath83 can steer the state @xmath84 from any initial state to any target state in finite time . the level of controllability of the networked system  ( [ eq : ct ] )",
    "is defined by the fraction @xmath27 of driver nodes in the sense that a complex network is more controllable if a smaller fraction of driver nodes is needed to achieve full control . according to liu _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , the key is to find a matrix @xmath83 associated with the minimum number of controllers to ensure full control of system ( [ eq : ct ] ) .",
    "because of the sparsity of mcn , @xmath26 of a layer @xmath10 is determined by  @xcite @xmath85 because in @xmath12 each node - labelled number can only link to the node - labelled numbers larger than itself , the coupling matrix @xmath79 is a strictly lower - triangular matrix .",
    "moreover , @xmath79 of @xmath12 is in a column echelon form because the minimum number linked from node @xmath2 is always @xmath55 .",
    "in other words , the leading coefficient of the @xmath7th column in @xmath79 is precisely in the @xmath86th row . on the other hand ,",
    "the last @xmath1 columns of @xmath79 are all zeros because the maximum @xmath1 nodes in @xmath12 have no out - links , so the rank of @xmath79 is exactly @xmath87 .",
    "an example of matrix @xmath79 of @xmath88 is @xmath89 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pbh ] ) , we can show that the minimum number of driver nodes @xmath26 for @xmath12 is @xmath1 and the value of non - zero elements in @xmath79 does not affect @xmath90 , which indicate that @xmath12 is ssc .    according to the exact controllability theory  @xcite , the control matrix @xmath83 to ensure full control of the congruence network @xmath12 should satisfy the following condition @xmath91 = n - r .",
    "\\label{eq : cond}\\ ] ] notice that the rank of the matrix @xmath92 $ ] is contributed by the number of linearly independent rows , hence the input signals specified via @xmath83 should be imposed on the linearly dependence rows in @xmath79 so as to eliminate all linear correlations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond ] ) .",
    "apparently , the first @xmath1 rows in the coupling matrix @xmath79 of @xmath12 are all zero rows ( see eq.([eq : mtx1 ] ) ) , hence the @xmath1 driver nodes that need to be controlled to maintain full control are just the minimum @xmath1 nodes of the congruence network , i.e. the @xmath1 roots of the chains in the congruence network ( see fig . [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "the coupling matrix of the divisibility network @xmath18 is also a strictly lower - triangular matrix and in a column echelon form , but the rank of the matrix is @xmath93 , because in @xmath18 the node with labelled number larger than @xmath94 has no out - links , namely , the last @xmath95 columns of the matrix are all zeros .",
    "an example of @xmath96 is @xmath97    therefore , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pbh ] ) , we finally obtain the minimum number of driver nodes of @xmath18 as @xmath98 , indicating that one must control half of the nodes in order to control the whole divisibility network .",
    "moreover , the value of non - zero elements in @xmath79 does not affect @xmath90 , which indicate that @xmath18 is ssc .",
