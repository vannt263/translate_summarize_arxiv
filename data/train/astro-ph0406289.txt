    "iras 19312 + 1950 is an sio maser source discovered by @xcite in their sio maser surveys toward selected iras sources in the galactic plane @xcite . @xcite",
    "first suggested that iras 19312 + 1950 is an agb / post - agb star evolved from a relatively massive progenitor on the basis of its prominent bipolar shape seen in near - infrared images and the low color temperature of the dust envelope .",
    "in fact , sio maser sources are usually identified as a late - type star with active mass - loss .",
    "subsequently , they have found two remarkable characteristics of this object : ( 1 ) two kinematic components in molecular line profiles ( strong line with a narrow width of @xmath6 2 km s@xmath3 ; weak - symmetric line with a broad width of @xmath7 60 km s@xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 2 ) a rich set of molecular species , @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent near - infrared observations ( murakawa 2004 , in private communication ) suggested that there is a ring - like structure with a size of about 10@xmath8 around the central star .",
    "some of the characteristics found in iras 19312 + 1950 are often seen in dark clouds ( or ysos ) . however , secure examples of ysos emitting sio masers are quite limited ; actually , only three : ori irc 2 , w51 irs 2 and sgr b2 md5 ( cf .",
    "these ysos with sio masers lie in the extreme star forming regions ( in giant molecular clouds ) , which are clearly identified as largely extended nebulae in infrared images , whereas no clear star forming activity is seen around iras 19312 + 1950 in infrared images .",
    "thus the evolutionary status of iras 19312 + 1950 is not yet definitely known .    to investigate the nature of this highly unusual sio maser source",
    ", we are currently conducting high - spatial - resolution interferometric observations using the bima array in several molecular rotational lines detected by our single - dish observations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we report the first result of the interferometeric observations in the hco@xmath0 @xmath10 line , and the detection of a bipolar flow , which might be interpreted by interaction between an agb wind and ambient material .",
    "interferometric observations of iras 19312 + 1950 were made with the berkeley - illinois - maryland - association ( bima ) millimeter array from december 2003 to january 2004 .",
    "the instrument is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we observed the hco@xmath0 @xmath10 line at 89.188526 ghz with the bima array consisting of 10 elements in one configuration ( b - array ) .",
    "the observations were interleaved every 25 minutes with the nearby point source , 1925 + 211 , to track the phase variations over time .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was determined from observations of uranus , and is accurate to within 20% .",
    "the final map has an accumulated on source observing time of about 15 hrs .",
    "typical single sideband system temperatures ranged from 200 k to 300 k. the velocity coverage was 380 km s@xmath3 , using three different correlator windows with a bandwidth of 50 mhz each .",
    "the velocity resolution was 1.3 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the phase center of the map was 19@xmath933@xmath1024.4@xmath11 , 19@xmath1256@xmath1354.8@xmath8 ( j2000 ) corresponding to the iras position of this object .",
    "data reduction was performed with the miriad software package @xcite .",
    "standard data reduction , calibration , imaging , and deconvolution procedures were followed .",
    "robust weighting of the visibility data gave 3.7@xmath8 @xmath14 2.5@xmath8 clean beam with a position angle of 23.0@xmath12 .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "noise per 1.0 km s@xmath3 is 3.8@xmath1410@xmath15 jy beam@xmath3 .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectrum of the hco@xmath0 @xmath10 line . a remarkable feature seen in the spectrum is a strong line with a narrow width ( @xmath2 2 km s@xmath3 ) peaked at @xmath16 km s@xmath3 .",
    "a weak symmetric line with a broad width ( @xmath2 60 km s@xmath3 ) is also seen in the velocity range of @xmath17  70 km s@xmath3 . for convenience ,",
    "we call the former the `` narrow component '' , and the latter the `` broad component '' in this paper . the narrow component is roughly centered on the broad component .",
    "absorption features are seen beside the narrow component , suggesting that cold gas components lie in the foreground .",
    "the line profile of hco@xmath0 is reminiscent of that of the co @xmath10 ( and @xmath181 ) line ( cf .",
    "similar line profiles including the two kinematic components ( narrow and broad components ) have been reported in some agb stars ( ex .",
    ", ep aqr , x her and rv boo , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported on a bipolar flow consisting of the broad component seen in x her , and @xcite suggested a scenario where episodic mass - loss plays a role to explain the kinematic components seen in these agb stars .",
    "figure 2 shows velocity integrated intensity maps in three different velocity ranges corresponding to the narrow component ( broken contour ) and the blue- and red - shifted wings of the broad component ( thin and thick solid contours , respectively ) .",
    "the map is superimposed on a combined near - infrared image ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21-bands ) taken by the ciao camera on the subaru telescope ( courtesy of koji murakawa , motohide tamura and the ciao group in the national astronomical observatory in japan ) .",
    "the velocity ranges used for computing integrated intensities are indicated in figure 1 and the caption of figure 2 .",
    "the source is clearly resolved by the synthesized beam ( shown at the lower - right in figure 2 ) . though we observed with only one configuration , most part of the flux emitted from the source",
    "is thought to be detected according to the upper limit of the source size ( @xmath2 30@xmath8 ) determined by our single - dish observation @xcite . as the most pronounced feature in the map , we can see a bipolar shape consisting of the thin and thick contours .",
    "the apparent axis of the bipolar shape is close to the nne  ssw direction .",
    "if the bipolar shape originates in a bipolar outflow , the lower side ( southern component ) should be closer to us , and the upper side ( northern component ) should be further from us .",
    "interestingly , the structure of the blue - shifted wing ( thin contour ) of the broad component shows two extended tails : the strong tail to the southeast , and the weak tail to the east exhibiting a `` lying - y '' shape .",
    "the structure of the red - shifted wing ( thick contours ) extends only to the northeast . on the contrary ,",
    "the structure of the narrow component ( broken contour ) is somewhat complicated .",
    "three intensity peaks are seen in the broken contour at the points of 3@xmath8 , 4@xmath8 and 8@xmath8 from the map center to the northeast , northwest and east , respectively .",
    "although the positions of these peaks of the narrow component do not correspond to bright regions seen in the near - infrared image ( background of figure 2 ) , it looks as though the global structure of the narrow component clearly correlates with the near - infrared structure . from the apparent size of the hco@xmath0 structure and the assumption of the density , we can crudely estimate the mass of the source .",
    "if we assume that the source is a homogeneous sphere with a diameter of 10@xmath8 , the mass is estimated to be 431 m@xmath22 , where we used the distance ( 2.5  5.5 kpc ) estimated by @xcite and the assumed density of 10@xmath23 @xmath24 traced by the hco@xmath0 line .    to investigate the kinematic structure",
    ", we made position - velocity ( @xmath25@xmath26 ) diagrams at various cuts .",
    "figure 3 shows the @xmath25@xmath26 diagrams at selected cuts . in the top four diagrams in figure 3 ,",
    "velocity channels are averaged over 2 km s@xmath3 intervals .",
    "the cuts used for the diagrams are indicated in figure 2 as the broken arrows .",
    "the directions of the arrows in figure 2 represent the positive direction of the offset axes in figure 3 .",
    "the origins of the cuts a , b , c and d are taken at the phase center .",
    "the origin of the cut e is indicated by the filled dot in figure 2 .",
    "the cut `` a '' corresponds to the apparent axis of the bipolar shape .",
    "the cut `` b '' represents the perpendicular cut to the cut a. the cut `` c '' corresponds to the major axis of the ring - like structure seen in near - infrared images .",
    "the cut `` d '' represents the perpendicular cut to the cut c. the cut `` e '' is mentioned later .",
    "although the global structure seen in figure 3 is highly clumpy , the spatial size ( vertical size of structure ) of the source tends to be smaller in higher - velocity regions .",
    "intensity peaks lie nearly on the origins in vertical axes in velocity ranges , @xmath27 km s@xmath3 and @xmath28 km s@xmath3 .",
    "in addition , maximum velocity widths ( represented by the maxim widths of the lowest contours in the horizontal coordinates ) do not exhibit any noticeable variations with respect to the position angle .",
    "these facts mean that the higher velocity part ( @xmath29 km s@xmath3 ; here , we assume that the system velocity is @xmath30 km s@xmath3 ) of the broad component is not resolved by our synthesized beam , and should originate in a relatively small region ( @xmath5 ) . on the other hand , variations of structure are found in lower velocity ranges ( @xmath31 km s@xmath3 ) of the broad component especially in the blue - shifted side ( 20 km s@xmath3 @xmath6 @xmath32 35 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "in fact , intensity peaks at @xmath33 km s@xmath3 clearly shift to the negative direction in the offset axes .",
    "these peaks correspond to the southern and northern tails of the blue - shifted wing ( cf . , thin contour in figure 2 ) .",
    "the 27 km s@xmath3 peaks seen in the cuts a , c and d correspond to the southern tail , and the 25 km s@xmath3 peak seen in the cut b corresponds to the northern tail . on the contrary , in the red - shifted side ,",
    "no clear variations of structure are seen except for an extension to the positive direction in the offset axis in the cut a ( and possibly in c ) at @xmath34 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we also made @xmath25@xmath26 diagrams without channel binding to check the motion of the narrow component in several cuts .",
    "finally , we found the most pronounced variation of structure in the cut `` e '' corresponding to the tail growing to the southeast from the intensity peak at ( dec , ra)@xmath35(1.1@xmath8 , @xmath362.5@xmath8 ) .",
    "the @xmath25@xmath26 diagram in the cut e is shown in the bottom panel in figure 3 , and there is clear variation of structure as a function of radial velocity .",
    "the peak has another tail extended to the southwest .",
    "the southwest tail also exhibits a systematic variation of structure in a @xmath25@xmath26 diagram , though the diagram is not shown in this paper . in any other cuts , no clear variation of velocity structure",
    "is found in the narrow component .",
    "we are likely to see complicated variation of the narrow component in the top four panels in figure 3 .",
    "these structures are explained well by a superposition of the two flows mentioned above .",
    "the bipolar flow seen in iras 19312 + 1950 consists of the lower - velocity part of the broad component , whereas the higher - velocity part originates in a small region with a size of less than about 3@xmath8 .",
    "usually , the expansion velocity of bipolar flows seen in late - type stars ( especially in post - agb stars ) tends to increase with a distance from the central star ( frequently called ",
    "hubble type flow  in this area , cf .",
    "* ) , the nature of the bipolar flow seen in iras 19312 + 1950 is in disagreement with this point . in our opinion ,",
    "the characteristics of the bipolar flow are explained by hydrodynamical interaction between a spherical outflow lying at the center and ambient material with axial symmetric structure if the spherical outflow expelled from the central star is distorted to a bipolar shape by the interaction .",
    "in such a case , the slow expanding velocity of the bipolar flow seems to be somewhat strange , but the slow velocity would be explained by a projection effect if the flow has an inclination angle of 20@xmath12 ( where we assume the velocity of the bipolar flow equals to a half of the maximum width of the broad component , i.e. @xmath2 30 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "interestingly , in figure 2 , the bipolar shape precisely escapes from dense regions of the narrow component , and the red - shifted component of the bipolar flow lies in the interspace between two remarkable intensity peaks of the narrow component .",
    "in addition , the absorption feature beside the narrow component seen in figure 1 might be explained as the near side of the ambient material ( with axial symmetric structure ) .",
    "if the higher - velocity part of the broad component is a spherical outflow from the central star , the flow should be identified as an agb outflow , because the spherical outflow is the typical nature of agb envelopes , and also because the expanding velocity of @xmath37 km s@xmath3 is very reasonable as that seen in the super - wind phase at the late - agb stage .",
    "our recent co data taken by the bima array also support the spherical property of the inner part of the nebulosity .",
    "however , a problem is the somewhat strong hco@xmath0 intensity ( especially in the outermost parts of the envelope ) if the central star is an o - rich agb star , because the hco@xmath0 line is usually weak or null in agb envelopes except a few cases @xcite . from the viewpoints of theory ,",
    "the hco@xmath0 molecule can be produced by photo - chemical process in an o - rich agb envelope up to the radius @xmath38 cm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; mamon et al",
    ". took account of ionization by galactic and stellar uv photons , and high - energy particles in their calculation . ) .",
    "however , we still need additional chemical process to explain the effective formation of hco@xmath0 in the outermost parts of the envelope , because it is most likely that the outermost part of hco@xmath0 emission is further than 10@xmath39 cm from the central star if the central star is an agb star ( estimated distance : 2.55.1 kpc , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an immediate possibility to explain the highly extended hco@xmath0 structure would be `` dissociative shock '' . actually , most agb envelopes exhibiting the hco@xmath0 emission show signs of shocks ( cf .",
    "* ) . the hco@xmath0 emission in oh 231.8 + 4.2 , which is a well - known example of an sio maser source with a bipolar shape , is also explained by shocks @xcite .",
    "the shock ionization also supports our idea to explain the kinematic structure of the bipolar flow , because shock fronts are likely to be produced between an agb wind and ambient material .",
    "remaining problems in the interpretation as an agb star are excess of mass and mass - loss rate .",
    "although we estimated mass to be 431 m@xmath22 in a previous section , the mass will be over 8 m@xmath22 if the distance exceeds 3 kpc .",
    "in such a case , the nebulosity can not be explained as material expelled from a central agb star .",
    "if we assume a spherical flow and density of 10@xmath40 cc@xmath3 at 10@xmath39 cm from the central star , the mass - loss rate is estimated to be about 10@xmath41 m@xmath22 yr@xmath3 in terms of the expanding velocity of the broad component ( @xmath2 30 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this mass - loss rate is slightly larger than a typical value of agb stars ( @xmath42 m@xmath22 yr@xmath3 ) .",
    "the keys to check the agb possibility would be near - star kinematics and isotope ratio ( ex . , @xmath43c/@xmath44c ) , because agb stars and ysos are known to be have significantly different kinematics especially in a near - star region , and because @xmath43c should be enhanced in a circumstellar envelope if the central star lies at the late - agb stage .",
    "in this paper , we reported a result of an interferometeric observation of an sio maser source , iras 19312 + 1950 , in the hco@xmath0 @xmath10 line .",
    "we found two kinematical components in the spectrum including a strong - narrow line ( narrow component ) and a weak - broad line ( broad component ) .",
    "velocity integrated intensity maps showed a pronounced bipolar shape consisting of lower - velocity parts of the broad component .",
    "the higher - velocity parts of the broad component were not resolved by our synthesized beam , and should originate in a relative small region with the size of less than @xmath2 3@xmath8 .",
    "the spatial structure of the narrow component clearly correlated with the near - infrared structure . in @xmath25@xmath26 diagrams , a systematic variation of structure was found in the lower - velocity part of the broad component , indicating a presence of a bipolar outflow .",
    "we suggest that the characteristics of the bipolar flow seen in iras 19312 + 1950 are explained by interaction between an agb wind and ambient material with axial symmetric structure .",
