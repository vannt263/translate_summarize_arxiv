    "the fdrm allows to control the expected rate of false detections ( due to background fluctuations ) within a selected sample .",
    "the method was adapted to the analysis of _ agile _ gamma - ray data of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "given an observed distribution of background counts - per - pixel ( the null hypothesis ) , the selection is based on choosing pixels characterized by @xmath24-values - value '' assigned to a given value of a random variable is defined as the probability , when the null hypothesis is true , of obtaining that value or larger . ]",
    "smaller than a threshold , @xmath25 .",
    "the crucial fdrm feature is that a @xmath24-value threshold is _ not _ fixed a priori ( as in traditional statistical methods ) , but is estimated on the data with the requirement that the rate of false detections , within the selected sample , is the chosen @xmath25 or smaller .",
    "a typical value used in the literature @xcite , and that we adopt as a starting value for our search , is @xmath25=0.05 .",
    "the fdrm ensures to control this rate , while accounting for the post - trial correction of a single detection significance @xcite .",
    "we apply the fdrm in two different ways .",
    ".3 cm    _ the global - fdrm ( g - fdrm ) _ : in this case we carry out a blind search for ( persistent or transient ) sources in large ( _ global _ ) daily counts maps of the galactic plane ( @xmath26 pixel size ) .",
    "the null hypothesis for these daily maps is the ( background dominated ) counts distribution of the galactic plane ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the random fluctuations and the diffuse gamma - ray emission of these daily maps are well described by poissonian distributions in _ agile - grid _ data .",
    "candidate sources in the daily maps are identified as significant deviations from the average distribution that applies to that specific day . in our analysis",
    "we use a threshold of @xmath28 that limits the contamination by false positive sources in the sample below 5@xmath29 . _ the source - fdrm ( s - fdrm ) _ : the s - fdrm searches for flaring episodes in the counts light curve extracted from the position of a _ single _ candidate source location . in the ( verified ) assumption that the average source flux at a given position is typically below the instrument sensitivity , unless it is producing ( rare ) flares , the null hypothesis in this case is obtained by measuring the distribution of photon counts for the specific sky location observed at intervals of 1-day .",
    "we considered the nominal position and used an aperture search radius of 1.5@xmath15 .",
    "as in the case for g - fdrm , candidate flaring sources are detected as deviations from the poissonian average distribution , i.e. fluctuations with @xmath30value below the chosen threshold .    .",
