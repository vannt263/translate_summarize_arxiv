    "in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the fluctuations of the positions of nucleons in the overlap region are found to play an important role in controlling the shape of the initial geometry of the created matter , which subsequently controls the azimuthal anisotropy of the particles in the final state  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the geometry in azimuth can be characterized by a set of multi - pole components ( also known as `` eccentricities '' ) at different angular scale , calculated from the participants and binary collisions at @xmath5  @xcite : @xmath6 with a weight of @xmath7 for binary collisions and @xmath8 for participants  @xcite , where @xmath5 are calculated relative to the weighted center of gravity .",
    "the orientations of the minor and major axes for each moment @xmath9 are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the minor axis direction @xmath0 is also known as the @xmath12-order participant plane ( pp ) .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath0 can be calculated easily using simple geometric models such as monte carlo glauber code from  @xcite .",
    "when fluctuations are small and linearized hydrodynamics is applicable , each @xmath13 is expected to independently drive the corresponding @xmath12-order anisotropic flow @xmath14 along @xmath0  @xcite . in this case , one may rely on a simple glauber model calculation to estimate the correlations between anisotropic flows of different order  , but not so for @xmath15 except in central collisions  @xcite .",
    "our estimation of higher order @xmath0 should be digested with this caveat in mind . ] .",
    "previous studies  @xcite show that significant correlations can exist between @xmath16 and @xmath17 due to the almond shape of the average collision geometry .",
    "however , correlations involving odd planes for @xmath18 are found to be generally weak except in very peripheral collisions , e.g. between @xmath16 and @xmath19 or between @xmath16 and @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "experimental studies support a strong correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xcite , but a weak correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the correlations among three planes of different order have also been investigated recently  @xcite , such as @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; they are argued to contain strong correlations between the dipole asymmetry and the triangularity .",
    "here we propose an alternative experimental method for measuring these correlations .",
    "the expected performance of this method is evaluated based on the correlation signals from glauber model .",
    "the @xmath12-order flow has @xmath9-fold symmetry in azimuth , and the correlations between flow directions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are completely described by the differential distribution @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the least common multiple of @xmath9 and @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "this distribution should be an even function due to symmetry , and can be expanded into a fourier series : @xmath27    in a real experiment , the underlying true event plane directions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are unattainable due to limited detector acceptance and finite multiplicity .",
    "they are approximated by the measured event plane angle @xmath30 and @xmath31 , calculated based on the azimuthal distribution of particles in the detector acceptance .",
    "the coefficients @xmath32 can be obtained by calculating the raw coefficients @xmath33 , followed by a simple correction for finite event plane resolution : @xmath34 the resolution factor @xmath35 can be determined using the standard two - subevent or three - subevent methods  @xcite . to avoid auto - correlations ,",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be measured using sub - events covering different @xmath36 ranges , preferably with a gap in between .",
    "interestingly , some of the two plane correlators defined by eq .",
    "[ eq:1aa ] are related to the so called mixed harmonics , referring to @xmath37 measured in @xmath0 event plane for integer @xmath38 , denoted as @xmath39 ( see ref .",
    "for example , it is straightforward to show that @xmath40 is simply the ratio of the integral @xmath41 measured in the @xmath16 plane ( @xmath42 ) to the integral @xmath41 measured in the @xmath17 plane ( @xmath43 ) : @xmath44 .",
    "more generally , one has : @xmath45 additional examples include @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the method described above can be generalized to correlations involving three or more event planes . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the correlations that can be measured experimentally , involve combination of @xmath48 planes of different order : @xmath49 with @xmath50 . the correlations involving three planes of different order , e.g. @xmath51 , @xmath16 and @xmath19 , have the following form : @xmath52 where we use the constraint @xmath53 and we adopt the short - hand notations : @xmath54 . this type of correlations can be generally determined from the underlying 2-d distribution in ( @xmath55 ) via a similar fourier expansion approach : @xmath56\\\\\\label{eq:2b}&+&2\\sum_{i , j=1}^{\\infty}v_{1,2,3}^{i,\\pm j } \\cos \\left(i\\phi_{2,1}\\pm j\\phi_{3,1}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this series is expected to converge quickly for non - peripheral collisions .",
    "therefore , only the terms for @xmath57 are required ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients are : @xmath58 under this notation , the two - plane correlator can be treated as special case : @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the average of the sine term in eq .",
    "[ eq:3a ] may not be zero , if the fluctuations of @xmath16 and @xmath19 relative to @xmath51 are correlated , i.e. @xmath16 and @xmath19 prefer to appear simultaneously to one side of @xmath51 .",
    "it represents a non - trivial correlation that is of great interest for understanding the nature of the fluctuations ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "a similar resolution correction procedure can be used to connect the measured correlated with the corrected one : where we have assumed that @xmath30 is distributed randomly around @xmath28 , such that @xmath61 .",
    "again , the @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 should be calculated from subevents covering different @xmath36 acceptances to avoid auto - correlations .    in  @xcite , teaney and yan proposed to study the correlator @xmath4 and @xmath65 . in our notations",
    ", they correspond to the cosine average of the 2-d distribution ( @xmath55 ) projected along the direction @xmath66=(1,-1 ) and ( 2,-1 ) , respectively .",
    "our framework provides a natural way to visualize and systematize the study of these correlators .",
    "other triple plane correlators can be similarly analyzed , the first few are @xmath67 note that @xmath68 in eq .",
    "[ eq:4a3 ] is an integer by the requirement @xmath69 .",
    "these correlators can be uniquely identified with one of the fourier coefficients in the double differential distributions similar to eq .",
    "[ eq:2b ] .",
    "however , the expression of triple plane correlator in terms of the correlation between two di - plane correlators is not always possible , for example @xmath70 . in this case",
    ", it can be regarded as a sum of the fourier coefficients for triple differential distributions @xmath71 that contribute to @xmath72 .",
    "the measurement of correlations involving two or more event planes are feasible at the lhc due to the large detector coverage in @xmath36 ( @xmath73 in atlas and cms ) , and excellent reaction plane resolution  @xcite .",
    "this allows the choice of many non - overlapping sub - events , each with very good @xmath36 coverage for these multi - plane correlation measurements .",
    "this works as long as the true event plane angle does not rotate as a function of pseudorapidity and so far there are no experimental evidences for this rotation .",
    "the coefficients @xmath74 or @xmath75 are related to the previously proposed multi - particle correlators from ref .",
    "that approach effectively applies a weight @xmath76 if the angle @xmath77 appears in the correlator .",
    "this weight maximizes the correlation signal and reduce the contribution for events which have small @xmath14 . for @xmath78 and @xmath79 ,",
    "the weights are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively ; they are then divided by @xmath82 and @xmath83 to obtain the true correlations .",
    "note that the weighting procedure can also amplify contributions from the tail of the @xmath13 distribution , especially for large values of @xmath84 , this may complicate the mapping from the measurement to correlations between @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , all events have the same weight in our approach ( including those with small @xmath13 values unfortunately ) . in our opinion , the two methods are complimentary to each other .",
    "in fact , it is possible to construct some hybrid correlators that involves azimuthal angle of both event planes and single particles .",
    "for example , one can consider the following mixed correlator between @xmath85 particles and event planes @xmath86 : where @xmath87 , @xmath88 are azimuthal angles of @xmath85 particles , and subscript @xmath89 indicates the weighting factor introduced by those particle multiplets .",
    "similar formula can be generalized to correlations involving more than two event planes .",
    "three interesting examples are : where @xmath90 is the @xmath91 and @xmath36 dependent weight ( @xmath92 is rapidity - even for au+au collisions ) that designed to suppress global momentum conservation effects and maximizing the @xmath93 signal ( or effectively increasing the resolution for @xmath62 )  @xcite . even though terms related to @xmath93 ( @xmath94 and/or @xmath95 ) appear in eq .",
    "[ eq:5c]-[eq:5d ] , the global momentum conservation effects are expected to be either negligible ( eq .  [ eq:5c ] ) or absent ( eq .  [ eq:5d ] ) for these correlators  @xcite .",
    "the hybrid correlators are useful in real experiments where detector subsystems have limited geometrical acceptance , finite granularity ( so ca nt distinguish individual particles ) , limited @xmath91 reach or no @xmath91 information at all . in this case",
    ", it is straightforward to calibrate the event plane measurement , while the calibration procedure could be more involved for multi - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "similar to  @xcite , we use a simple glauber model  @xcite to estimate the level of the correlations between @xmath12- and @xmath96-order participant plane .",
    "about 2.5 million au+au collisions are simulated , where each au ion is populated randomly with nucleons with a hard - core of 0.3 fm in radii , according to the woods - saxon distribution with a radius of 6.38 fm and diffuseness of 0.535 fm .",
    "a nucleon - nucleon cross - section of @xmath97  mb is used .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath13 are defined as a combination of participants and binary collisions in the transverse plane as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "however , instead of using the minor axes of @xmath13 as the proxy for the true event planes , we actually calculate the correlations between the major axes , which are related to the former by a simple phase shift @xmath98 : @xmath99 the corresponding fourier coefficients are denoted as @xmath100 , and are related to @xmath101 as @xmath102 the reason for doing this is a simple matter of convenience : the correlations between major axes are found to be almost always positive in the glauber model , hence using major axes simplifies the presentation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the phase shift , when folded to @xmath103 $ ] , is @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "the latter case leads to a sign flip : @xmath106 .     for various choices of @xmath9 and @xmath25 .",
    "]        the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] show the @xmath107 correlations predicted by the monte carlo glauber model .",
    "the correlation is weak in central collisions but is quite strong in peripheral collisions .",
    "this is understood  @xcite due to a detailed interplay between the fluctuation and average shape for the collision geometry : the central collisions are fluctuation - dominated , hence @xmath0 are largely uncorrelated , while the peripheral collisions are dominated by the average geometry which has @xmath108 components that are aligned  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] also shows that the first order component captures most of the shape information in central collisions .",
    "in contrast , many components are needed to describe the tight correlation in peripheral collisions .",
    "this behavior is generally true in the glauber model : whenever the first term @xmath109 is large , more higher - order terms are needed to describe the full distribution .",
    "note that if the participant planes are used instead , the distribution @xmath110 would show an anti - correlation : the distributions have their minima at 0 , and the sign of @xmath111 alternates between positive and negative : @xmath112 .",
    "the calculations are extended for all types of correlations for @xmath24 up to 16 .",
    "of course , additional correlations can also be calculated but the resolution is expected to deteriorate quickly for large values of @xmath24 . the centrality dependence of these correlations , characterized by the first fourier coefficient @xmath113 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where the centrality is characterized by number of participating nucleons ( @xmath114 ) . in most cases , the correlations are found to be either consistent with zero or positive ( except for @xmath115 in mid - central collisions ) . in particular ,",
    "strong correlations are observed for @xmath107 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ; they are presumably associated with the average geometry .",
    "the correlations are small in central collisions and over the full range for other choices of @xmath9 and @xmath25 , suggesting that the correlations are generally weak when they are dominated by fluctuations .",
    "we would like to draw the reader s attention to the bottom panels , which suggest that there are significant correlations between @xmath51 and all other higher - order pps .",
    "recently , significant dipolar flow @xmath93 has been observed in pb - pb collisions at the lhc by the atlas collaboration  @xcite and a theoretical group  @xcite based on the alice data  @xcite ; large dipolar flow is also predicted in hydrodynamic  @xcite or transport models  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the correlations between dipolar flow and higher - order flow is large and measurable , as long as one can find a way to determine @xmath51 without the bias of the global momentum conservation effect .",
    "one possibility might be to use the modified event plane method from ref .",
    "@xcite .    to get a feeling on how many @xmath118 terms are needed to exhaust the information encoded in distribution @xmath119 , in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we show the centrality distribution of @xmath118 for several values of @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "most of correlations are exhausted by including the @xmath1225 , except for a few cases at @xmath123 , such as @xmath107 and @xmath124 .",
    "the results presented in figs .  [ fig:1]-[fig:3 ] are obtained using the @xmath125 weighting ( i.e. eq .",
    "[ eq : enb ] ) and glauber model .",
    "alternatively we have calculated the @xmath0 using the @xmath126 weighting for @xmath127 and @xmath128 weighing for @xmath129  @xcite ; we also repeated the same calculation using a cgc ( color glass condensate ) geometry  @xcite for both the @xmath125 and @xmath126 weighting .",
    "the results for these three cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] for @xmath122 .",
    "the main observations are qualitatively similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "however , there are some interesting changes in the magnitudes of some correlation values : the use of cgc model increases the correlation for @xmath130(2,4 ) and ( 2,6 ) but decreases the correlation for @xmath130(3,6 ) in mid - central collisions ; the use of @xmath126 weighting also in general increases @xmath118 and affects the relative magnitude of @xmath118 between @xmath130(2,4 ) and ( 3,6 ) in central collisions .    due to the phase shift between the two types of correlations given by eq .",

    "if the dynamic mixing between flow of different orders is important  @xcite , then this dependence could be strongly distorted .",
    "therefore , direct measurements of the correlations between the experimentally determined event planes of different order can help to resolve this issue .",

    "this correlation is also observed to be generally bigger for @xmath126 weighting and cgc geometry .",
    "hence a precise determination of this correlator could allow us to distinguish between different models for initial geometry .",

    "in summary , we discussed a method for measuring the correlations between the directions of the anisotropic flow of different orders .",
    "this method involves fourier transforming the differential distribution of the correlations between different event planes into various fourier components , where each component is corrected separately by an event plane resolution term .",
    "this method has the advantage of simultaneously analyzing many different correlators , especially those involving three or more different event planes , thus help identifying significant components .",
    "the expected strength of various two- or three - plane correlators are estimated using a monte carlo glauber model or cgc model .",
    "strong positive correlations are seen between the major axes of two eccentricities in mid - central and peripheral collisions for @xmath130(2,4 ) , ( 2,6 ) , ( 3,6 ) , and those involving the first - order eccentricity .",
    "similarly , several significant three - plane correlators have also been identified , revealing novel correlation patterns expected from the average geometry and/or initial state fluctuations .",
    "these strong correlations imply the need to measure several two- or three - plane correlators in order to describe the full distribution .",
    "a detailed comparison of the correlations calculated here with the data could shed light on the role of the initial geometry fluctuations and dynamic mixing during the hydrodynamic evolution leading to harmonic flow in the final state .",
    "our discussion so far has decoupled the magnitude of the flow @xmath14 from its phases @xmath0 . in principle , the correlation is ill - defined for events with very small @xmath14 .",
    "however these events are expected to have very broad raw correlation distribution and very poor resolution ( i.e. small @xmath35 ) , thus their contributions to the numerator and the denominator of eq .",
    "[ eq:1b ] are naturally suppressed . nevertheless , it is possible that the strength of the event plane correlation may depend on the magnitude of the @xmath14 .",
    "this dependence can be studied by first divide the events in a given centrality bin into various classes according to e.g. their @xmath161 values , measure the raw correlation and resolution factors in each event class , and then use eq .",
    "[ eq:1b ] to obtain the true correlation strength for each class .",
    "this may provide further insight on how the event plane correlation depends on the eccentricity of the initial geometry ( e.g. @xmath162 if events are classified according to @xmath161 ) .",

    "<S> a method is proposed to measure the relative azimuthal angle distributions involving two or more event planes of different order in heavy ion collisions using a fourier analysis technique . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis procedure is demonstrated for correlations involving two and three event planes ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier coefficients of these distributions are found to coincide with previously proposed correlators , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 etc , hence the method provides a natural framework for studying these correlators at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> using a monte carlo glauber model to simulate au+au collisions with fluctuating initial geometry , we are able to identify several new two- or three - plane correlators that have sizable magnitudes and should be measured experimentally . </S>"
