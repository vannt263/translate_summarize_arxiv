    "<S> in this paper , the approach for investigation of asymptotic ( @xmath0 ) scaling exponents of eulerian structure functions ( j. schumacher et al , new . j. of physics * 9 * , 89 ( 2007 ) . ) is generalized to studies of lagrangian structure functions in turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the novel `` bridging relation '' based on the derived expression for the fluctuating , moment - order - dependent dissipation time @xmath1 , led to analytic expression for scaling exponents ( @xmath2 ) of the moments of lagrangian velocity differences @xmath3 in a good agreement with experimental and numerical data .    _ introduction . _ </S>",
    "<S> a turbulent flow can be described using eulerian and lagrangian approaches addressing dynamics of velocity field and evolution of individual fluid particles , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can introduce two kinds of structure functions , i.e. moments of velocity increments . the properties of eulerian correlation functions ( esf ) were first theoretically investigated by kolmogorov in his celebrated k41 theory of turbulence based on an exact in the inertial range relation for the third - order structure function @xmath4 [ 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of lagrangian correlation functions , for which not a single exact dynamic relation exists , is not new and was originally formulated within the framework of kolmogorov theory of turbulence ( for a detailed review , see ref.[2 ] ) . due to technological limitations of the past </S>",
    "<S> , experimental studies of strong turbulence were mainly devoted to eulerian structure functions ( esf ) @xmath5 limited to the single- point measurements with subsequent application of taylor hypothesis . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 is a component of velocity field parallel to the displacement vector @xmath7 chosen along the @xmath8-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental and numerical studies of eulerian structure functions revealed two distinct intervals : while in the analytic range @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) , the velocity field is differentiable and @xmath11 , at the scales @xmath12 , the esfs are given by algebraic relations @xmath13 with ` anomalous ' scaling exponents @xmath14 . by this definition , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 s are the cut - offs separating analytic and ` rough ' ranges of esfs . </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig.1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable breakthroughs in experimental particle tracking , led by the bodenschatz group [ 3]-[7 ] , enabled investigation of lagrangian structure functions ( lsf ) @xmath16 which are a crucial ingredient in understanding of turbulent transport and mixing . due to analyticity of velocity field , as @xmath17 , @xmath18 where </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 is acceleration of a fluid particle and @xmath20 . for the time - increments @xmath21 , the lsfs @xmath22 with the dissipation times @xmath1 separating analytic and rough intervals on a time - domain . </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the recent multifractal theory of lsfs [ 6 ] stressed the importance of the dissipation time @xmath23 which was treated in the spirit of kolmogorov theory as a moment - number- independent quantity @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a large - scale eddy turn - over time . to make a connection between esfs and lsfs , the authors of ref . [ </S>",
    "<S> 6 ] used the `` bridging relation '' ( br ) : @xmath26 with the time - increment @xmath27 approximately equal to the fluctuating eddy turn - over time in _ the inertial range_. this expression , introduced on dimensional grounds in ref.[8 ] , can be understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> consider a fluid particle at a time @xmath28 occupying position @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the particle displacement is : @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that if @xmath32 , the displacement @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> then , following [ 2 ] ( page 342 , where it is related to transition to a moving frame of reference ) , we define the regularized ( not involving single - point- velocity ) quantity : @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> ( it is estimated in ref.[2 ] ( page 359 ) that @xmath35 , meaning that it tends to zero when either @xmath36 or @xmath17 . ) from the mean value theorem we also have @xmath37 , where @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath39 is obtained in the first approximation setting @xmath40 which resembles the one used in construction of kraichnan s lagrangian history direct interaction approximation [ 9 ] . keeping in mind topological complexity of developed turbulence </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the mean value theorem , leading to the `` bridging relation '' @xmath41 with the inertial range time - increments @xmath42 , can not be accurate . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the br was analyzed using the exact relations between eulerian and lagrangian structure functions by kamps et al [ 10 ] who showed that , combined with the multifractal formalism , it leads to the lagrangian exponents in a substantial disagreement with experimental [ 3]-[7 ] and numerical [ 11 ] data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it was pointed out that the theory of ref . [ 6 ] , expressing anomalies of lagrangian exponents in terms of anomalies of eulerian ones , does not explain the `` 2d - paradox '' : while the two - dimensional eulerian turbulence is not intermittent , the lagrangian one is .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , based on the ideas developed in refs.[12]-[16 ] , we attack the problem differently . in the _ analytic ( dissipation ) _ range where @xmath18 , the displacement @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolating this to the dissipation cut - off @xmath44 , separating analytic and rough intervals of the structure functions , leads to the dissipation time @xmath23 :    @xmath45    both @xmath46 and @xmath23 in formula ( 1 ) are random functions investigated in great detail theoretically and numerically [ 13]-[16 ] . unlike the br defined for the large inertial range values of the time - increment @xmath47 , the expression ( 1 ) , introduced as an extrapolation of the exact in the analytic interval relation , is accurate for short times @xmath48 . _ theoretical basis for this extrapolation </S>",
    "<S> is understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the structure functions , both eulerian and lagrangian , can be formally represented as @xmath49 with the @xmath8-dependent exponents @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) covering both analytic ( @xmath52 ) and inertial ( @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) ranges . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest inertial range exponents giving maximum values to the differences @xmath55 , correspond to the strongest singularities of velocity field and defining the cut - offs by the matching relation @xmath56 , we account for the strongest , dominant , singularities . </S>",

    "<S> the point of their crossing is @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> schematic.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the probability distribution functions @xmath64 , derived and investigated numerically in [ 14]-[15 ] enable one to evaluate the moments of the dissipation scales :    @xmath65    combining ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and assuming continuity of @xmath66 on the dissipation time scale yields :    @xmath67    our goal now is to express the dissipation times @xmath68 in terms of the reynolds number and , comparing the result with formula ( 2 ) , obtain expressions for lagrangian exponents @xmath2 .    _ eulerian structure functions . _ since energy dissipation in the inertial range dynamics ( inverse - energy - cascade ) of 2d turbulence is irrelevant , the relation ( 2 ) , obtained by balancing viscous dissipation and inertial - range contributions to the exact equations for the eulerian structure functions ( see refs . </S>",
    "<S> [ 14]-[16 ] ) is valid for three - dimensional flows only . if , in accord with kolmogorov theory , we assume @xmath69 , this formula gives the well - known @xmath70-independent relation @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to intermittency , the function @xmath14 is a convex function of the moment order @xmath70 and for a fixed reynolds number @xmath72 , the dissipation scales @xmath15 decrease with @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> ( this result has been numerically tested in ref.[16 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the inertial range is compressed to the interval between integral and dissipation scales ( @xmath73 ) , experimental determination of exponents @xmath14 is very difficult and at the present time only the exponents @xmath14 with @xmath74 have been accurately established by direct investigation of inertial range dynamics . in accord with the recently developed theory of small - scale intermittency , the dissipation scale is defined by a dynamic reynolds number @xmath75 [ 15 ] . </S>",
    "<S> first , we see that the dissipation scale is not a constant as in k41 , but a fluctuating property of a flow . </S>",
    "<S> then , it is easy to show [ 14[-[16 ] that @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath44 is the scale separating analytic and rough scale- intervals of the velocity field , it has been shown that :    @xmath77    using ( 2 ) we derive readily :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 are the exponents of the moments of the dissipation rate @xmath80 . according to this calculus , the moments of lagrangian acceleration    @xmath81    the quantitative results of ref . </S>",

    "<S> we do not have any reason to believe that @xmath84 with @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the accuracy of the relation ( 7 ) must be of the order @xmath86 , which is numerically small . </S>",
