    "recent experiments have shown the possibility to emit quantized charges by mesoscopic capacitors  @xcite|these systems are also known as single - particle sources ( spss ) .",
    "the indistinguishable nature of the emitted charges has been proven via a quantum interference experiment.@xcite a mesoscopic capacitor consists of a quantum dot ( qd ) that can exchange carriers only via a quantum point contact ( qpc ) with an external electron reservoir|usually a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) . the carrier emission from the qd to the 2deg",
    "is obtained by driving the qd s energy levels periodically around the fermi level of the 2deg via a gate coupled capacitively to it .",

    "the device we propose emits two charge particles at the same time .",
    "however , our device differs from a double sps  @xcite because the two emitted particles are not only correlated in time but also in spin : their reciprocal spin polarization is fixed by trs , thus forming a kramers pair . because of these properties we name our device : spin particles source ( spps ) .",
    "we believe the spps can represent the analog of the spin polarized photon source used in quantum optics .",

    "has shown that coulomb interaction for dots of size @xmath20 m in diameter has as main effect the renormalization of the fermi - velocity , but does not affect qualitatively the particle emission .",
    "recent experiments have shown that the edge states are characterizing by a width on the order of 5 @xmath21 m .",
    "@xcite in order to avoid overlap between the edge states , we estimate that the radius of the spps qd should be greater than the experimental measured width of the edge states . within this assumption",
    "the screening of the coulomb interaction induced by the top gate enables us to treat the system as non - interacting .",

    "it is interesting to notice , that|as reflected by the vanishing diagonal elements of the s - matrix and the helical nature of the edge - states|although a particle with spin up incident on the qd , can leave it only as a spin up , the spin state within the qd is not defined .",
    "the states inside the qd are in a superposition of spin - up and spin - down propagating clockwise or anti - clockwise , respectively .",

    "we consider the correlation function between the two contacts as defined in ref .",
    "[ ] . at finite temperatures @xmath62 , the only contribution to noise is thermal noise",
    ". it does not contain any information about the quantization of the emitted charge .",
    "this noise is independent of the qd and can therefore not provide any information about the spps .",
    "interestingly the same result can be obtained in a slightly more complicated set - up|fig .",
    "[ antibunching ] . here , the two emitted particles are propagating towards a second qpc|called c|tuned in a regime where only forward scattering processes contribute .",

    "this set - up is an electronical solid state realization of the hong - ou - mandel optics experiment .",
    "@xcite specifically , c is now acting as a beam splitter .",

    "_ i.e. _ possess different quantum numbers .",
    "then , after scattering at c , in lack of any quantum mechanical restriction , both electrons can move in the same direction .",
    "experimentally , the former corresponds to an arrival at two different detectors and the latter to an arrival at the same detector .",
    "@xcite    there has been a theoretical@xcite and experimental analysis@xcite of the electronic anti - bunching for two synchronized sps .",
    "this corresponds to the discussed former case where fermionic statistics lie at the heart of an anti - bunching effect",
    ". a distinctive feature of 2d ti is an effect , known as the @xmath0 peak of noise .",
    "@xcite it predicts an electronic anti - bunching in the case of two electrons with opposite spin , propagating in the edges of a 2d ti as long as trs is conserved . for the case of the spps , these two effects interplay and lead to a complete noise  canceling .",
    "this is somewhat surprising as one expects the two single - particle excitations arriving at c to occupy different spin states .",
    "hence , the pauli principle does not apply and thus the two particles could still bunch , however trs conservation prevents them from moving along the same edge resulting therefore in an effective antibunch . indeed ,",
    "if they were propagating along the same edge , they would have to occupy the same spin state , what is ruled out by fermionic statistics .",
    "this is a new form of antibuching typical of ti , thus we name this phenomenon @xmath0-_antibunch_.    in our set - up the synchronization is included in the emission of the two particles .",
    "thus , measuring zero correlations is a signature of synchronized emission of the two particles .",
    "deviations from the zero - noise are introduced by a magnetic field applied locally to the qd  @xcite@xmath63 or by changing the arrival time of the two electrons with respect to each other .",
    "the latter case can in principle be realized by changing the length of the upper @xmath64 or the lower @xmath65 arm in fig .",
    "[ antibunching ] or equivalently by altering the fermi - velocity in a finite region of one of the arms .",

    "the diagonal elements of the scattering matrix become finite leading to a non - zero cross - correlator at zero temperature similar to the case studied in ref .",
    "assessment of the typical longitudinal width of the wave packet shows that they are rather broad ( on the order of microns ) , corresponding to an uncertainty in the arrival time of the electrons at c. hence , experimentally , one should expect a small deviation from the zero - noise feature , characteristic of perfect synchronization .",

    "[ ] : @xmath76 this gives a quantitative measure for the entanglement : @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) indicates maximum ( no ) entanglement .",
    "after scattering , the two qubit state is re - expressed as @xmath79 where the @xmath80-operators correspond to creation in one of the output arms .",
    "direct evaluation of the concurrence for the outgoing state yields zero , indicating a lack of entanglement .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that a certain component of the wave - function addressed in a post - selection procedure , corresponds to a maximally entangled state .",
    "therefore , the two - particle state is projected on the part of the wavefunction corresponding to simultaneous detection of particles by a and b. this post - selection restricts the coefficient matrix @xmath81 to the off - diagonal blocks .",
    "after this projection , the coefficients are renormalized in order to restore a unit modulus for the wave - function .",
    "experimentally , this corresponds to choosing a subset of detection events .",
    "the emerging non - classical correlations are reflected in a non - vanishing concurrence as depicted in fig .",

    "we observe , that for a specific choice of the qpc - characteristic amplitudes @xmath82 , the concurrence is non - zero ( equal to 1 ) indicating partial ( maximum ) entanglement .    for experimental detection of this entanglement , we propose a set - up that allows for violation of the chsh - inequality .",
    "@xcite therefore , a and b have analogs of light polarizers at their disposal .",

    "such a tunability of transmission probabilities is predicted to be achievable using electrostatical side - gates on constrictions.@xcite in the qubit picture , the effect of the two polarizer - qpcs corresponds to local rotations on the bloch sphere .",

    "the chsh - inequality takes a particularly simple form : @xmath95 the left - hand side evaluates to @xmath96 , thus maximally violating the inequality .",

    "the presented result is therefore only valid in the limit @xmath97 , where the normalization of the particle - number - difference correlator , eq .",

    "we have suggested a noise measurement that permits to investigate the helical nature of the two electrons in a new phenomenon , called @xmath0-_antibunch_. in addition , such a noise measurement can proof the simultaneous emission of two particles .",

    "a gate provides a modulation of the electrostatic profile in the heterostructure . in a standard semiconducting mesoscopic device",
