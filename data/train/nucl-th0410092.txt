    "quantum inversion has many applications in nuclear physics .",
    "most of the potential descriptions of the few - body nuclear scattering base on the inversion of the scattering data .",
    "though nucleon - nucleon interaction is used as input for all nuclear calculations , here we always have some fitted parameters and this fitting is , of course inversion .",
    "moreover all modern high - precision nucleon - nucleon potentials are fitted to scattering data and are now perceived as phenomenology .",
    "the problem here is `` that quantitative models for the nuclear force have only a poor theoretical background , while theory based models yield only poor results '' @xcite . at the same time the nucleon - nucleon phase shift analysis data are smooth in all investigated energy region up to 3 gev @xcite",
    "this fact justifies the potential description without explicit internal degrees of freedom .",
    "it is commonly supposed that nucleon - nucleon potential is nonlocal .",
    "however local configuration space potentials simplify nuclear calculations greatly .",
    "nonlocality effects may be treated as corrections due to the internal degrees of freedom . for these reasons construction of the high - precision local nn potential describing at least nn scattering data",
    "is necessary for exact calculations in nuclear theory .",
    "recently such results appeared in the literature @xcite . to simplify the following investigations we worked out the presented simple algorithm which allows to invert scattering data above inelasticity limit and to get the corresponding optical potential .    in sect .",
    "2 we describe our inversion algorithm , that allows to get the configuration space potential from phase shift analysis data neglecting inelasticity . in sect .",
    "3 we show how to get an optical complex - valued potential from the real - valued one .",
    "this optical potential describes phase shift analysis data and loss of flux due to inelastic processes . in sect .",
    "4 we apply the worked out method to the nucleon - nucleon scattering data .",
    "we extract two different optical potentials corresponding to the different asymptotic behavior of the scattering data .",
    "the input data of the marchenko inversion are @xmath5    where @xmath6  is the scattering matrix dependance on the momentum @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the energy of the j - th bound state , so that @xmath10 , @xmath11  is the particle ( reduced ) mass .",
    "the @xmath12 matrices give the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding normalized bound states .",
    "these are output data of the partial scattering schrdinger equation @xmath13\\psi(r , q)=q^2\\psi(r , q ) \\label{schr}\\ ] ]    to illustrate the worked out algorithm first we consider the one channel case .",
    "we proceed from the marchenko equation @xmath14    where    @xmath15    @xmath16 are the riccati - hankel functions .",
    "solution of the eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is the function @xmath17 , which gives the reconstructed potential @xmath18 for the eq .",
    "( [ schr ] )    @xmath19    contrary to the the algorithm used in @xcite we use the algebraic approximant not for the phase shifts @xmath20 but for the @xmath0-matrix    @xmath21    or @xmath22    in the approximant ( [ eq5a ] ) @xmath23 and @xmath24 are an odd and even polynomials of @xmath7 , which do not turn to zero at the real axis simultaneously ( for @xmath25 , in the case then there is a bound state with @xmath26 , conversely @xmath23 and @xmath27 are even and odd polynomials ) . in the approximant ( [ eq5b ] ) @xmath28 and @xmath27 must be of different parity , but we can not describe the case with zero energy bound state .",
    "the important feature of approximants ( [ eq5a ] ) and ( [ eq5b ] ) is that these are the most common pad approximants for the @xmath0-matrix consistent with its properties .",
    "both approximants lead to the finite - dimensional kernel @xmath29 of the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath30 and potential @xmath31 are expressed through the elementary functions ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and powers of @xmath34 ) , so we get bargmann potentials .",
    "choice ( [ eq5a ] ) or ( [ eq5b ] ) is fixed for needed ( phenomenological ) dependance @xmath6 by numerical experiment .",
    "we choose the relation which approximates @xmath6 better with less number of @xmath35 poles ( taking into account their multiplicity ) .",
    "the less number of these poles gives the more simple potential .",
    "the properties of the pad approximants are well known , and there are broad enough functional classes , for which this approximation converges everywhere besides poles of these functions . in particular , the consequence of the pad - hypothesis @xcite is that if a function is analytical at point @xmath36 and meromorphic at circle @xmath37 , containing this point , then its diagonal pad approximations @xmath38 $ ] ( where @xmath39 is the number of the approximation poles ) converges to this function on compact subsets of @xmath37 , which do not contain the poles of this function .",
    "obviously for the major part of nuclear physics problems the @xmath0-matrix does satisfy these conditions . particularly for the short range",
    "potentials the @xmath0-matrix is meromorohic at all complex plane .",
    "another remark concerns the @xmath0-matrix poles positions .",
    "our approximants for @xmath0-matrix ( [ eq5a ] ) , ( [ eq5b ] ) suggest that @xmath0-matrix poles may be positioned everywhere besides the real axis . previously at numerical approaches",
    "the following @xmath0-matrix approximant was used @xcite :    @xmath40    with real values @xmath41 , what assumes that @xmath0-matrix poles are positioned only at the imaginary axis .",
    "it is obvious , our approximants are more common and allow to reconstruct the potentials of more complex form .    the approximants ( [ eq5a ] ) and ( [ eq5b ] ) lead to the following expressions for the phase shifts @xmath42",
    "@xmath43    or @xmath44    having the scattering data set @xmath45 ( @xmath46 , we get system of @xmath47 linear equations which define @xmath47 unknown coefficients of @xmath48 from ( [ eq6a ] ) and ( [ eq6b ] ) .",
    "the number of experimental phase shifts differs generally from the chosen number @xmath47",
    ". therefore the phenomenological dependance @xmath49 must be approximated by appropriate spline .",
    "the @xmath47 needed values @xmath50 are defined by some selection from this spline .",
    "the increase in number of precise experimental phase shifts would make approximants ( [ eq5a ] ) , ( [ eq5b ] ) more close to the true @xmath0-matrix .",
    "the scattering data are defined experimentally and they have errors .",
    "the arbitrary selection of @xmath51 ( @xmath46 from the experimentally defined allowable region may lead to close roots of the polynomials @xmath23 and @xmath27 , i.e. to false @xmath0-matrix poles .",
    "therefore @xmath23 and @xmath27 must be factored and close roots particularly those situated near the real axis must be eliminated .",
    "this elimination corresponds to elimination of the pad approximant defects .",
    "furthermore , using the approximant ( [ eq5a ] ) ( in case of ( [ eq5b ] ) the solution is a particular case of the considered below solution for two bound channels ) and calculating the integral in the eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) using the residue theorem , we get the following expression for the kernel @xmath29 of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] )    @xmath52    where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 are the @xmath0-matrix poles .",
    "summing is taken over all the @xmath0-matrix poles @xmath55 positioned above the real axis and over bound states @xmath56 : @xmath57 .",
    "so in this case the kernel of the eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is finite - dimensional .",
    "it is known that solution of such equations reduces to the linear equations solving .",
    "we present the specific solution of this equation for our case .",
    "we search the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) in the form    @xmath58    where @xmath59 are unknown coefficients . substituting ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) into ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "we get the following system of linear equations    @xmath60    where @xmath61    the functional coefficients @xmath59 are defined by ( [ eq9 ] )    @xmath62    then @xmath30 and the potential @xmath63 from ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the worked out technique of the inversion problem was approved on restoration of the square pit potentials .",

    "by analogy with ( [ eq5b ] ) we approximate the @xmath0-matrix by the following expression    @xmath72    here we again choose the most general form of pad approximant in contrast to the form used in @xcite .",

    "are easily calculated analytically , but are cumbersome so we do not present them .    having solved this linear equation system",
    "we get the sought - for potential from ( [ eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the multichannel generalization is made analogously .",
    "the marchenko inversion does not give the needed optical potential . but found potential may serve as the initial potential for the iteration procedure that converts it into the optical ( complex - valued ) potential that describes inelastic processes .",
    "first we consider the one channel problem .",
    "the phase equation @xcite for the initial potential @xmath95 obtained by some inversion procedure ( say from marchenko equation ) is    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is riccati - bessel amplitude @xcite .",
    "let us consider the complex - valued potential @xmath98 obtained from @xmath95 by transformation    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is some real parameter .",

    "then as a first approximation we may take    @xmath106    for inelastic scattering the @xmath0-matrix is expressed through the real inelastic parameter @xmath107 and the real phase shift @xmath108    @xmath109    so it is easily arrived at    @xmath110    @xmath111    whence it follows that @xmath112 .",
    "the formula ( [ eq27 ] ) allows to calculate the parameter @xmath113 from the known values @xmath107 and @xmath114 .",
    "this approximation works well enough for many quantum mechanical problems . for example in case of nucleon - nucleon scattering @xmath115 below the inelasticity limit which is high enough and @xmath107 grows slowly enough above this limit .",

    "the case of two channels is considered in a like manner , though the final expressions are more complex . by analogy with the one channel case",
    "the following generalization for the optical potential is derived ( the mixing parameter @xmath123 is considered small ) :    @xmath124    the first @xmath0-matrix approximation is    @xmath125    as all the parameters and phase shifts are real , then eq . ( [ eq29 ] )",
