    "the leiden - berkeley deep survey ( ` lbds ' ) consists of nine high latitude fields in the selected areas sa28 , sa57 , sa68 and an area in hercules .",
    "they were surveyed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope at 21  cm ( 1.412  ghz ) , reaching a 5-@xmath3 limiting flux density of 1  mjy ( windhorst et  al .",
    "multi - color prime focus photographic plates of the fields were used to find optical counterparts to the radio sources .",
    "identifications were found for 53% of the sources in the full survey , whilst for the hercules fields 47 out of 73 sources were identified ( windhorst et  al .",
    "1984b ; kron et  al .",
    "1985 ) .",
    "the hercules fields were subsequently observed on the 200  inch hale telescope at palomar observatory between 1984 and 1988 .",
    "multiple observations were made through gunn @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters over six runs .",
    "after processing and stacking of the multiple - epoch images , optical counterparts for 22 of the sources were found , leaving only four sources unidentified to @xmath7 .",
    "near - infrared observations have been made of the entire subsample at k , yielding 60/73 detections down to @xmath821 .",
    "half of the sources have been observed in h and approximately one - third in j. observations of the brighter sources were made by thuan et  al .",
    "( 1984 ) and by neugebauer et  al .  and katgert et  al .",
    "( priv .  comm . ) .",
    "k - band observations of the sample were completed by the present author and collaborators at the uk infrared telescope .    prior to the start of the current work , only 16 of the 73 sources in the lbds hercules fields had redshifts published in the literature .",
    "another 16 sources had unpublished redshifts .",
    "the author and collaborators have successfully observed a further 17 sources during the past few years , using both the 4.2  m william herschel telescope ( waddington 1999 ) and the 10  m keck telescope ( dunlop et  al .",
    "1996 ; spinrad et  al .  1997 ; dey 1997 ) .",
    "this brings the total number of spectroscopic redshifts to 49 out of 73 sources ( 67% ) .",
    "photometric redshifts were calculated for the remaining one - third of the sample , using the spectral population synthesis models of jimenez et  al .",
    "dunlop & peacock  ( 1990 ) used a sample of radio sources brighter than 0.1  jy at 2.7  ghz to investigate the evolution of the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) .",
    "they concluded that the comoving density of both flat- and steep - spectrum sources suffers a cut - off at redshifts @xmath94 .",
    "this conclusion was drawn from the behavior of both free - form and simple parametric models ( ple / lde ) , and the model - independent , banded @xmath10 test . however , the results were crucially dependent upon the accuracy of their redshift estimates in the parkes selected regions ( psr ) .    figure  [ iwfig1]a compares the flux limits of the lbds with those of the psr and 3c surveys .",
    "it is seen how the lbds can be used to : ( i ) probe the faint end of the rlf out to much greater redshifts than the brighter surveys ; and ( ii ) detect powerful radio galaxies out to very high redshifts ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus we are able to use this millijansky sample to test the reality of the redshift cut - off . in figure  [ iwfig1]b the cumulative redshift distribution of the lbds hercules sample ( only those sources with @xmath12  mjy )",
    "is compared with the predictions of dunlop & peacock  ( 1990 ) .",
    "it is seen that two of the free - form models ( ff-4 and ff-5 ) provide a reasonable fit to the data over all redshifts , suggesting that the high-@xmath13 decline in the rlf is real .",
    "the `` bump '' in the best - fit histogram at @xmath14 is due to two spikes in the redshift distribution , that may be the result of possible large - scale structures ( sheets ) along the line of sight .",
    "however , a more detailed investigation of the rlf reveals that the _ luminosity _ dependence of the data does not agree with the models .",
    "the observed rlf shows some indication that it turns over at @xmath151.5 , and that the redshift of this cut - off is a function of the radio luminosity .",
    "the small number of sources makes it difficult to separate the redshift and luminosity dependence of the rlf sufficiently to be certain of this trend , but work is ongoing to improve the modeling of the data .",
    "two of the most interesting individual sources in the sample are 53w069 and 53w091 .",
    "keck spectra of these galaxies revealed that their restframe ultraviolet light was dominated by old stellar populations at ages of 4.5  gyr at @xmath16 and 3.5  gyr at @xmath17 respectively ( dey 1997 ; spinrad et  al .",
    "although there continues to be some debate over the accuracy of these ages , there can be little dispute that they are two of the oldest galaxies observed at that redshift .    an important corollary to investigate was whether these galaxies were also _ dynamically _ old objects .",
    "peacock et al .  ( 1998 ) showed that in order for the number density of these objects to be consistent with the evolving power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations , then the galaxies must be 34  gyr old at @xmath1 , having collapsed at @xmath188 .",
    "this result is independent of the ages of the sources derived from their keck spectra .",
    "further clues to the dynamical history of the two galaxies can be gained by looking at their morphologies . 53w069 and 53w091",
    "were observed using wfpc2 and nicmos on the _ hubble space telescope _ in cycle 7 ( waddington et al .",
    "data were collected in f814w and f110w : these filters bridge the 4000    break and are thus most sensitive to the young and old stars in a galaxy respectively .",
    "figure  [ iwnicmos ] shows the f110w images and surface brightess profiles for the two objects .",
    "53w069 has a regular de vaucouleurs @xmath2 profile , with an effective radius of 05 or 4  kpc ( h@xmath19  km  s@xmath20  mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "53w091 is similarly dominated by an @xmath2 profile of effective radius 05 ( 4  kpc ) , however there is an additional component required to fit this galaxy .",
    "the form of this extra emission has not been unambiguously identified , but initial results suggest that it is consistent with an exponential profile of 02 ( 2  kpc ) scale - length , contributing @xmath23% of the f110w flux within a 15 diameter aperture .    the spectrum of 53w091 can be modeled by adding a young stellar population to the spectrum of 53w069 .",
    "similarly the surface brightness profile of 53w091 can be modeled by adding an exponential component to the profile of 53w069 .",
    "a possible interpretation is that 53w091 has a star - forming disk - like structure surrounding an otherwise passively evolving elliptical galaxy , such as 53w069 .",
