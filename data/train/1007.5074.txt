    "in this chapter , the probability distribution of money in a system of economic agents is studied using methods of statistical physics .",
    "this study originates from the interdisciplinary field known as econophysics @xcite , which applies mathematical methods of statistical physics to social , economical , and financial problems @xcite .",
    "one of the most puzzling social problems is the persistent wide range of economic inequality among the population in any society . in statistical physics",
    ", it is very well known that identical ( `` equal '' ) molecules in a gas spontaneously develop a widely unequal distribution of energies as a result of random energy transfers in collisions between the molecules . using similar principles ,",
    "this chapter shows how a very unequal probability distribution of money among economic agents develops spontaneously as a result of money transfers between them .",
    "the literature on social and economic inequality is enormous @xcite .",
    "many papers in the economic literature @xcite use a stochastic process to describe dynamics of individual wealth or income and to derive their probability distributions .",
    "one might call this a one - body approach , because wealth and income fluctuations are considered independently for each economic agent .",
    "inspired by boltzmann s kinetic theory of collisions in gases , we introduce an alternative , two - body approach , where agents perform pairwise economic transactions and transfer money from one agent to another .",
    "we start with a simple pairwise - transfer model proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model is the most closely related to the traditional statistical mechanics , which we briefly review first .",
    "then we discuss other money - transfer models and further developments . for a more detailed and systematic review of the progress in this field ,",
    "see the recent review by @xcite , as well as reviews by @xcite and a popular article by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the study of pairwise money transfer and the resulting statistical distribution of money have virtually no counterpart in the modern economic literature .",
    "only the search theory of money @xcite is somewhat related to it .",
    "however , a probability distribution of money among the agents within the search - theoretical approach was only recently obtained numerically by the economist miguel @xcite .",
    "the fundamental law of equilibrium statistical mechanics is the boltzmann - gibbs distribution .",
    "it states that the probability @xmath0 of finding a physical system or subsystem in a state with the energy @xmath1 is given by the exponential function @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the temperature , and @xmath4 is a normalizing constant @xcite . here",
    "we set the boltzmann constant @xmath5 to unity by choosing the energy units for measuring the physical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "then , the expectation value of any physical variable @xmath6 can be obtained as @xmath7 where the sum is taken over all states of the system .",
    "temperature is equal to the average energy per particle : @xmath8 , up to a numerical coefficient of the order of 1 .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) can be derived in different ways @xcite .",
    "all derivations involve the two main ingredients : statistical character of the system and conservation of energy @xmath1 .",
    "one of the shortest derivations can be summarized as follows .",
    "let us divide the system into two ( generally unequal ) parts .",
    "then , the total energy is the sum of the parts : @xmath9 , whereas the probability is the product of probabilities : @xmath10 .",
    "the only solution of these two equations is the exponential function ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "a more sophisticated derivation , proposed by boltzmann , uses the concept of entropy .",
    "let us consider @xmath11 particles with the total energy @xmath12 .",
    "let us divide the energy axis into small intervals ( bins ) of width @xmath13 and count the number of particles @xmath14 having the energies from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the ratio @xmath17 gives the probability for a particle to have the energy @xmath15 .",
    "let us now calculate the multiplicity @xmath18 , which is the number of permutations of the particles between different energy bins such that the occupation numbers of the bins do not change .",
    "this quantity is given by the combinatorial formula in terms of the factorials @xmath19 the logarithm of multiplicity is called the entropy @xmath20 . in the limit of large numbers , the entropy per particle can be written in the following form using the stirling approximation for the factorials @xmath21 now we would like to find what distribution of particles among different energy states has the highest entropy , i.e. ,  the highest multiplicity , provided the total energy of the system , @xmath22 , has a fixed value .",
    "solution of this problem can be easily obtained using the method of lagrange multipliers @xcite , and the answer is given by the exponential distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "the same result can be also derived from the ergodic theory , which says that the many - body system occupies all possible states of a given total energy with equal probabilities .",
    "then it is straightforward to show @xcite that the probability distribution of the energy of an individual particle is given by eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "the derivations outlined in sec .  [ sec : bgphysics ] are very general and only use the statistical character of the system and the conservation of energy .",
    "so , one may expect that the exponential boltzmann - gibbs distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) would apply to other statistical systems with a conserved quantity .",
    "the economy is a big statistical system with millions of participating agents , so it is a promising target for applications of statistical mechanics .",
    "is there a conserved quantity in the economy ?",
    "@xcite argued that such a conserved quantity is money @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , the ordinary economic agents can only receive money from and give money to other agents .",
    "they are not permitted to `` manufacture '' money , e.g. ,  to print dollar bills .",
    "let us consider an economic transaction between agents @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "when the agent @xmath24 pays money @xmath26 to the agent @xmath25 for some goods or services , the money balances of the agents change as follows @xmath27 the total amount of money of the two agents before and after transaction remains the same @xmath28 i.e. ,  there is a local conservation law for money . the rule ( [ transfer ] ) for the transfer of money is analogous to the transfer of energy from one molecule to another in molecular collisions in a gas , and eq .",
    "( [ conservation ] ) is analogous to conservation of energy in such collisions .",
    "conservative models of this kind are also studied in some economic literature @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that , in the model of @xcite [ as in the economic models of @xcite ] , the transfer of money from one agent to another represents payment for goods and services in a market economy .",
    "however , the model of @xcite only keeps track of money flow , but does not keep track of what goods and service are delivered .",
    "one reason for this is that many goods , e.g. ,  food and other supplies , and most services , e.g. ,  getting a haircut or going to a movie , are not tangible and disappear after consumption . because they are not conserved , and also because they are measured in different physical units , it is not very practical to keep track of them .",
    "in contrast , money is measured in the same unit ( within a given country with a single currency ) and is conserved in local transactions ( [ conservation ] ) , so it is straightforward to keep track of money flow .",
    "it is also important to realize that an increase in material production does not produce an automatic increase in money supply .",
    "the agents can grow apples on trees , but can not grow money on trees .",
    "only a central bank has the monopoly of changing the monetary base @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "( debt and credit issues are discussed separately in sec .",
    "[ sec : debt ] . )    enforcement of the local conservation law ( [ conservation ] ) is the key feature for successful functioning of money .",
    "if the agents were permitted to `` manufacture '' money , they would be printing money and buying all goods for nothing , which would be a disaster .",
    "the purpose of the conservation law is to ensure that an agent can buy goods and products from the society ( the other agents ) only if he or she contributes something useful to the society and receives money payment for these contributions .",
    "thus , money is an accounting device , and , indeed , all accounting systems are based on the conservation law ( [ transfer ] ) .",
    "the physical medium of money is not essential as long as the local conservation law is enforced .",
    "the days of gold standard are long gone , so money today is truly the fiat money , declared to be money by the central bank .",
    "money may be in the form of paper currency , but today it is more often represented by digits on computerized accounts .",
    "so , money is nothing but bits of information , and monetary system represents an informational layer of the economy .",
    "monetary system interacts with physical system ( production and consumption of material goods ) , but the two layers can not be transformed into each other because of their different nature .    unlike , ordinary economic agents , a central bank or a central government can inject money into the economy , thus changing the total amount of money in the system .",
    "this process is analogous to an influx of energy into a system from external sources , e.g. ,  the earth receives energy from the sun .",
    "dealing with these situations , physicists start with an idealization of a closed system in thermal equilibrium and then generalize to an open system subject to an energy flux .",
    "as long as the rate of money influx from central sources is slow compared with relaxation processes in the economy and does not cause hyperinflation , the system is in quasi - stationary statistical equilibrium with slowly changing parameters .",
    "this situation is analogous to heating a kettle on a gas stove slowly , where the kettle has a well - defined , but slowly increasing , temperature at any moment of time . a flux of money may be also produced by international transfers across the boundaries of a country .",
    "this process involves complicated issues of multiple currencies in the world and their exchange rates @xcite .",
    "here we consider an idealization of a closed economy for a single country with a single currency .",
    "another potential problem with conservation of money is debt .",
    "this issue will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : debt ] .",
    "as a starting point , @xcite considered simple models , where debt is not permitted , which is also a common idealization in some economic literature @xcite .",
    "this means that money balances of the agents can not go below zero : @xmath30 for all @xmath24 .",
    "transaction ( [ transfer ] ) takes place only when an agent has enough money to pay the price : @xmath31 , otherwise the transaction does not take place .",
    "if an agent spends all money , the balance drops to zero @xmath32 , so the agent can not buy any goods from other agents .",
    "however , this agent can still receive money from other agents for delivering goods or services to them . in real life ,",
    "money balance dropping to zero is not at all unusual for people who live from paycheck to paycheck .",
    "macroeconomic monetary policy issues , such as money supply and money demand @xcite , are outside of the scope of this chapter .",
    "our goal is to investigate the probability distribution of money among economic agents . for this purpose",
    ", it is appropriate to make the simplifying macroeconomic idealizations , as described above , in order to ensure overall stability of the system and existence of statistical equilibrium .",
    "the concept of `` equilibrium '' is a very common idealization in economic literature , even though the real economies might never be in equilibrium .",
    "here we extend this concept to a statistical equilibrium , which is characterized by a stationary probability distribution of money @xmath33 , in contrast to a mechanical equilibrium , where the `` forces '' of demand and supply balance each other .",
    "having recognized the principle of local money conservation , @xcite argued that the stationary distribution of money @xmath33 should be given by the exponential boltzmann - gibbs function analogous to eq .",

    "initially all agents were given the same amount of money , say , $ 1000 .",
    "then , a pair of agents @xmath38 was randomly selected , the amount @xmath26 was transferred from one agent to another , and the process was repeated many times .",

    "these examples show that the boltzmann - gibbs distribution does not necessarily hold for any conservative model .",

    "not surprisingly , the stationary money distribution again has the exponential shape , but now with the new boundary condition at @xmath94 and the higher money temperature @xmath95 . by allowing agents to go into debt up to @xmath92",
    ", we effectively increase the amount of money available to each agent by @xmath92 .",
    "so , the money temperature , which is equal to the average amount of effectively available money per agent , increases correspondingly .",
    "@xcite considered another , more realistic boundary condition , where a constraint is imposed not on the individual debt of each agent , but on the total debt of all agents in the system .",
    "this is accomplished via the required reserve ratio @xmath96 , which is briefly explained below @xcite .",
    "banks are required by law to set aside a fraction @xmath96 of the money deposited into bank accounts , whereas the remaining fraction @xmath97 can be loaned further . if the initial amount of money in the system ( the money base ) is @xmath29 , then , with repeated loans and borrowing , the total amount of positive money available to the agents increases to @xmath98 , where the factor @xmath99 is called the money multiplier @xcite .",
    "this is how `` banks create money '' .",
    "where does this extra money come from ?",
    "it comes from the increase in the total debt in the system .",
    "the maximal total debt is given by @xmath100 and is limited by the factor @xmath96 .",
    "when the debt is maximal , the total amounts of positive , @xmath101 , and negative , @xmath102 , money circulate among the agents in the system , so there are two constraints in the model considered by @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect to see the exponential distributions of positive and negative money characterized by two different temperatures : @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this is exactly what was found in computer simulations by @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reserve ] .",
    "similar two - sided distributions were also found by @xcite .    .",
    "the distribution is exponential for both positive and negative money with different `` temperatures '' @xmath105 and @xmath106 , as illustrated by the inset on log - linear scale . from @xcite . ]    however , in the real economy , the reserve requirement is not effective in stabilizing total debt in the system , because it applies only to deposits from general public , but not from corporations .",
    "moreover , there are alternative instruments of debt , including derivatives and various unregulated `` financial innovations '' . as a result ,",
    "the total debt is not limited in practice and can potentially reach catastrophic proportions . here",
    "we briefly discuss several models with non - stationary debt .",
    "thus far , we did not consider the interest rates .",
    "@xcite studied a simple model with different interest rates for deposits into and loans from a bank .",
    "computer simulations found that money distribution among the agents is still exponential , but the money temperature slowly changes in time . depending on the choice of parameters , the total amount of money in circulation either increases or decreases in time .",
    "interest amplifies destabilizing effect of debt , because positive balances become even more positive and negative even more negative due to accruement of interest .",
    "a more sophisticated macroeconomic model studied by the economist steve @xcite exhibits debt - induced breakdown , where all economic activity stops under the burden of heavy debt and can not be restarted without a `` debt moratorium '' .",
    "the interest rates were fixed in these models and not adjusted self - consistently .",
    "@xcite proposed a mechanism , where the interest rates are set to cover probabilistic withdrawals of deposits from a bank . in an agent - based simulation of the model , @xcite found that money supply first increases up to a certain limit , and then the economy experiences a spectacular crash under the weight of accumulated debt .    in the absence of a nominal limit on maximal debt",
    ", bankruptcy provides a mechanism for debt stabilization .",
    "when the debt of an agent becomes too large , the agent will not be able to borrow any more money and will not be able to pay the debt back , so he or she will have to declare bankruptcy .",
    "bankruptcy erases the debt of the agent ( the negative money ) and resets the balance to zero .",
    "however , somebody else ( a bank or a lender ) counted this debt as a positive asset , which also becomes erased . in the language of physics , creation of debt is analogous to particle - antiparticle generation ( creation of positive and negative money ) , whereas cancellation of debt by repayment or by bankruptcy corresponds to particle - antiparticle annihilation ( annihilation of positive and negative money ) .",
    "the former process dominates during economic bubbles ( booms ) and represents monetary expansion , whereas the latter dominates during the subsequent recessions ( busts ) and represents monetary contraction .",
    "bankruptcy is the crucial mechanism for stabilizing money distribution , but it is often overlooked by the economists .",
    "interest rates are meaningless without a mechanism specifying when bankruptcy is triggered .    after lending money out",
    ", the lender has the burden of collecting the debt from the debtor .",
    "thus , the act of lending creates a persistent link ( a string ) between the lender and the borrower , as emphasized in the chapter by heiner ganssmann in this volume .",
    "this is in contrast to payments by positive money for goods and services , which are final and do not leave any persistent link between the agents after the transaction .",
    "invention of the infamous collateralized debt obligations ( cdo ) obscured connections between lenders and borrowers by randomizing and anonymizing their pools .",
    "it destabilized the system by inviting unsustainable debt and made bankruptcy proceedings extremely difficult because of the scrambled identities of lenders and borrowers .",
    "as argued above , boundary conditions are crucial for stabilizing money distribution .",
    "typically , a lower bound is imposed , but not an upper bound ( in a capitalist , as opposed to a socialist , society ) . )",
    "becomes negative @xmath107 , so the slope in fig .",
    "[ fig : money ] changes to @xmath108 , which is known in physics as the inverse population .",
    "the case with both upper and lower limits was studied by @xcite . ]",
    "this asymmetry is very important for stability of a monetary system .",
    "numerous attempts were made to create alternative community money from scratch and most of them failed .",
    "in such a system , when an agent provides goods or services to another agent , their accounts are credited with positive and negative tokens , as in eq .",
    "( [ transfer ] ) .",
    "however , because the initial global money balance is zero in this case , the probability distribution of money @xmath33 is symmetric with respect to positive and negative @xmath23 .",
    "unless a boundary condition is imposed on the lower side , @xmath33 will never stabilize .",
    "some agents will accumulate unlimited negative balance by consuming goods and services and not contributing anything in return , thus undermining the system .",
    "in contrast , when a central government creates positive money by fiat and forces its usage by demanding that taxes are paid with this money , it creates a viable monetary system , as discussed in the chapter by randall wray in this volume .",
    "thus , taxation is an essential ingredient for vitality of a monetary system .",
    "in this chapter , we have demonstrated that random transfers of money in economic transactions between otherwise equal economic agents produce a broad and highly unequal probability distribution of money among the agents . in additive models ,",
    "the probability distribution of money is exponential and similar to the boltzmann - gibbs distribution of energy in statistical physics .",
    "multiplicative models produce a gamma - like distribution and a power - law tail for random saving propensity .",
    "local conservation of money in transactions between agents is crucial for the accounting function of money .",
    "ordinary economic agents can only receive and give money , but can not produce it .",
    "boundary conditions are necessary in order to achieve a stable probability distribution of money . without debt , zero money balance is the boundary .",
    "when debt is permitted , some sort of restriction on the negative money balances must be imposed , either by limiting individual or collective debt or by setting up conditions for bankruptcy .",
    "when debt is unlimited , the system is unstable and does not have a stationary state .",
    "it would be very interesting to compare these theoretical conclusions with empirical data on money distribution .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to obtain such data .",
    "the probability distribution of balances on deposit accounts in a big enough bank would be a reasonable approximation for money distribution among the population",
    ". however , such data are not publicly available .",
    "in contrast , plenty of data are available on income distribution from the tax agencies .",
    "quantitative analysis of such data for the usa @xcite shows that the population consists of two distinct social classes .",
    "income distribution follows the exponential law for the lower class ( about 97% of population ) and the power law for the upper class ( about 3% of population ) .",
    "although social classes have been known since karl marx , it is interesting that they can be recognized by fitting the empirical data with simple mathematical functions .",
    "using sophisticated models of interacting economic agents , the computer scientist ian @xcite demonstrated emergence of two classes in agent - based simulations of initially equal agents .",
    "this work has been further developed in the book by @xcite , integrating economics , computer science , and physics .",
    "nowadays , money is typically represented by data bits on computer accounts , which constitute the informational layer of the economy .",
    "in contrast , material standards of living are determined by the physical layer of the economy . in the modern society ,",
    "physical standards of living are largely determined by the level of energy consumption and are widely different around the globe .",
    "@xcite found that the probability distribution of energy consumption per capita around the world approximately follows the exponential law .",
    "so , it is likely that the energy consumption inequality is governed by the same principles as the money inequality .",
    "the energy / ecology and financial / economic crises are the biggest challenges faced by the mankind today .",
    "there is an urgent need to find ways for a manageable and realistic transition from the current breakneck growth - oriented economy , powered by ever - expanding use of fossil energy fuels , to a stable and sustainable society , based on renewable energy and balance with the nature .",
    "undoubtedly , both money and energy will be the key factors shaping up the future of human civilization .",
