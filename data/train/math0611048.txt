    "that is , for @xmath19 we consider @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for @xmath23 .",
    "+ a first analysis of this type of level sets was given in @xcite and @xcite for modular subgroups which satisfy the there so called ` red - condition ' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there it was shown that for these groups @xmath24 converges weakly to zero with respect to the lebesgue measure on the unit interval .",
    "subsequently , this result was improved in @xcite by showing that @xmath25 is equal to zero lebesgue  almost everywhere .",
    "besides , these papers obtained `` non - vanishing '' of limiting modular symbols _ only _ for the end points of closed geodesics , that is for quadratic surds . in these trivial cases",
    "the limiting modular symbol turns out to be given by integrating along the closed geodesic and then normalizing by the hyperbolic length of that geodesic .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to extend these results to arbitrary modular subgroups and to obtain that the limiting modular symbol is not equal to zero for large classes of perfect sets of positive hausdorff dimension .",
    "in particular , a side result of our analysis will be that every modular subgroup satisfies the red - condition , and hence that the results of @xcite and @xcite do in fact hold for arbitrary modular subgroups .",

    "there exists a strictly convex , differentiable function @xmath29 such that for each @xmath30 , @xmath31 in here , we have that @xmath32 , and that @xmath33 has a unique minimum at @xmath34 . also , we in particular have @xmath35 where @xmath36 is uniquely determined by @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , the description of the spectrum in ( [ mainbeta ] ) is almost complete in the sense that @xmath38    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall some basic facts on modular symbols .",
    "this includes a brief histogram on exact dual pairings . in section 3",
    "we first give a reminder on a beautiful construction which allows to visualize real numbers from a modular surface perspective .",
    "subsequently , we show how this can be generalized to arbitrary modular subgroups . here , the main result will be to use ergodicity of the geodesic flow to obtain that the so obtained generalized modular shift spaces are always necessarily finitely primitive . in section 4",
    "we introduce limiting modular symbol naturally arising from these generalized modular shift spaces , and show how these relate to the underlying branched geometry of numbers . in section 5 we will collect facts from the thermodynamic formalism which turn out to be crucial in the proof of our main theorem , which will then be given in section 6 .",
    "it is well known that the modular subgroup quotient @xmath39 can be viewed as a complex algebraic curve permitting an arithmetic structure .",
    "similar to the familiar picture in which @xmath40 represents the moduli space of elliptic curves , @xmath39 represents the moduli space @xmath41 of elliptic curves @xmath42 equipped with some finite additional structure determined by @xmath43 .",
    "hence , by adding the cusp points we obtain a pre - compactification of @xmath41 , given by including all possible ways in which @xmath42 degenerates to @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , if we further include all degenerations of @xmath42 to noncommutative tori , we derive the compactified moduli space @xmath45 whose boundary is given by the noncommutative space @xmath46 .",
    "since the level sets @xmath47 are clearly @xmath2invariant , a transfer of the results in this paper to the language of elliptic curve degenerations leads to that the modular multifractal spectrum corresponds to a continuous family of elements of the boundary of @xmath45 consisting of the ` bad quotients ' @xmath48 . ( for the relation of noncommutative geometry and modular subgroups , and for some of the literature on this , we refer to the recent survey article @xcite ) .    \\2 .",
    "let us also mention that the concept ` limiting modular symbol ' could easily be extended to more general concepts of ` modular symbols at infinity ' .",

    "let @xmath5 refer to the ( possibly branched ) covering surface @xmath69 of @xmath70 of genus @xmath6 , assumed to be compactified by having added the cusps .",
    "+ recall that a @xmath71-chain is a formal sum @xmath72 , where the @xmath73 are @xmath71-dimensional smooth oriented submanifolds of @xmath5 , and the coefficients @xmath74 are elements of some abelian group @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath71homology group @xmath76 of @xmath5 is then given via cycles and boundaries by @xmath77 . obviously , we have that @xmath78 , for each @xmath79 . in particular , @xmath80 is obtained geometrically by taking all loops in @xmath5 as generators and then factoring out the relation that two loops are homologous , that is they only differ by some boundary . by triangulating @xmath5 such that the directed edges of the triangulation represent the generators of the abelian group @xmath80 ( modulo the relations given by zero - homologous edge cycles ) , each element of @xmath80 can be written as a @xmath81linear combination of the directed edges .",
    "hence , @xmath80 is a finitely generated abelian group which is always equal to either @xmath82 or to a free product of @xmath82 with some torsion subgroups of the form @xmath83 and/or @xmath84 . given that @xmath80 is known",
    ", one can then apply the universal coefficient theorem to determine @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , we have that @xmath86 , and hence @xmath85 is a free @xmath87module of dimension @xmath88 , for any ring @xmath75 . in particular",
    ", this shows that the space @xmath89 is a real vector space of dimension @xmath88 .",
    "+ in order to see how @xmath89 fits in with @xmath18 , note that by de  rham theory we have that the @xmath8cohomology group @xmath90 is isomorphic to the de rham cohomology @xmath91closed @xmath8-forms@xmath92exact @xmath8-forms@xmath93 , and hence defines a dual pairing ( see e.g. the survey article @xcite ) @xmath94 by hodge decomposition , there exists an isometry between @xmath95 and the space @xmath96 of harmonic @xmath8forms . by considering real and imaginary parts of the pullbacks of these harmonic forms to @xmath11",
    ", we finally obtain an isomorphic representation of @xmath97 by the holomorphic cusp forms @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that @xmath18 is a @xmath6dimensional @xmath98vector space ( and hence a @xmath88dimensional @xmath99vector space ) ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) ) .",

    "@xcite ) . for the @xmath105 real period matrix @xmath106 ,",
    "this means that @xmath107 note that the above dual pairing shows that an element of @xmath89 can be viewed as a path in @xmath5 , or alternatively as a path in @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , by viewing it as a path in @xmath108 and noting that only the end points @xmath109 of the path matter , this allows to represent an elements of @xmath89 by the so called modular symbol @xmath110 .",
    "in particular , for each @xmath68 , any smooth path from @xmath111 to @xmath112 projects to a closed path in @xmath5 , and hence corresponds to a homology class in @xmath80 .",

    "one easily verifies that @xmath113 does not depend on @xmath116 , and that the assignment @xmath117 gives rise to a surjection of @xmath2 onto @xmath80 ( the kernel of this group homomorphism is generated by the commutators of @xmath2 ) .",
