    "switched - mode power converters are a very efficient way to transfer energy from a source to a load . a switched - mode power converter is formed from switches , inductors , and capacitors .",
    "if these components are ideal , they do not dissipate energy , and the efficiency of the power converter is 100% .",
    "a further advantage of switched - mode power converters is the increase in power density that has occurred in recent years .",
    "the power density is defined as the ratio between the nominal power of the converter and its volume .",
    "this power density has been constantly increasing owing to an increasing switching frequency .",
    "as this is a broad topic , there are several different ways to classify switched - mode power converters .",
    "the one - quadrant power converters are those with the capability to provide an output in only one quadrant of a plot of output voltage versus output current .",
    "these converters have the capability to transfer energy in only one direction .",
    "most one - quadrant converters can also be classified as dc  dc converters .",
    "the main application of these converters is in voltage regulation . in this application , a non - regulated voltage , which is usually provided by a diode rectifier stage ,",
    "is converted to a regulated output voltage which is not affected by the grid or variations in the load .",
    "this article gives an introduction to one - quadrant power converters .",
    "it presents the basic , or direct , dc  dc converter topologies , showing typical waveforms and the basic design equations .",
    "the basic concepts of regulation and control of dc  dc converters are also discussed .",
    "section [ sec : derived ] presents some of the most typical derived converter topologies reported in the literature .",
    "some topics related to one - quadrant power converters , such as synchronous rectification , interleaving , and soft commutation , are presented in section [ sec : topics ] .",
    "finally , resonant converters are briefly mentioned .",
    "the main application of one - quadrant power converters is in storage ring particle accelerators .",
    "these accelerators are the key components of synchrotron radiation light source facilities .",
    "a storage ring is a particle accelerator where the particles circulate around a ring for several hours while their energy is maintained constant .",
    "as the energy of the particles is constant , the magnetic fields used for bending and focusing the particle beam are also constant .",
    "these magnetic fields are generated by currents provided by high - precision , stable power supplies .",
    "the precision and stability of these converters are of the order of several parts per million .",
    "this section provides a short introduction to the basic topologies of one - quadrant power converters .",
    "these basic topologies are also known as direct dc ",
    "dc converters .",
    "one characteristic of these topologies is that they are built using only one commutation cell . a brief description ,",
    "a methodology for the analysis of these topologies , and key design equations are presented .",
    "first , the dc chopper converter is discussed as an introduction and to show how the average output voltage of a converter can be modified using ` on  off ' switches .",
    "the basic topologies considered are the buck , boost , and buck  boost converters .",
    "the simplest one - quadrant converter is the dc chopper , shown in .",
    "this consists of a dc input voltage source , a controllable switch , and a load resistor .",
    "when the switch is closed , the input voltage is applied to the resistor .",
    "this is defined as the ` on ' state of the converter .",
    "when the switch is open , the current through the resistor is zero and the voltage is zero .",
    "this is called the ` off ' state of the converter .",
    "the switch can be operated with a duty ratio @xmath0 , defined as the ratio of the on time of the switch to the sum of the on and off times . for constant - frequency operation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the period of the switching frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the average value of the output voltage is @xmath4 this average output voltage can be regulated by adjusting the duty cycle @xmath0 .",
    "the circuit shown in is not a ` practical ' circuit .",
    "the main reason for this is that it is not possible to build pure resistive elements . in practice ,",
    "the connection of devices and circuit elements creates stray inductances that have to be taken into account . a circuit including the stray inductance of the load is shown in .",
    "the inclusion of the inductance of the load leads to a need to provide a path for the current in the inductor .",
    "this is to comply with the ` rule ' of power electronics that a current source that is like an inductor must not be open - circuited .",
    "two circuits are defined according to the state of the switch ; these circuits are shown in .",
    "the current paths are shown in red .",
    "the load voltage and current are plotted in under the assumptions that the load current never reaches zero and the time constant of the load @xmath5 is much greater than the period @xmath6 .",
    "the average values of the output voltage and current can be adjusted by changing the duty ratio @xmath0 .",
    "this is the principle of control of switched - mode power converters .",
    "the addition of a capacitor to the circuit of leads to the first topology of basic , or direct , dc  dc converters .",
    "these are step - down converters and are commonly known as buck converters .",
    "the basic circuit diagram of a buck converter is shown in .",
    "it consists of a dc input voltage source @xmath7 , a controlled switch @xmath8 , a diode @xmath0 , a filter inductor @xmath9 , a filter capacitor @xmath10 , and a load resistance @xmath11 .",
    "dc  dc converters can operate in two distinct modes with respect to the inductor current @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ fig : buckwaveforms ] depicts the continuous conduction mode ( ccm ) , in which the inductor current is always greater than zero .",
    "when the average value of the input current is low ( high @xmath11 ) and/or the switching frequency @xmath3 is low , the converter may enter the discontinuous conduction mode ( dcm ) . in the dcm ,",
    "the inductor current is zero during a portion of the switching period .",
    "typical waveforms of the converter in the ccm are shown in .",
    "it can be seen from the circuit that when the switch @xmath8 is commanded to the on state , the diode @xmath0 is reverse biased .",
    "when the switch @xmath8 is off , the diode conducts so as to support an uninterrupted current in the inductor .        the relationships among the input voltage , the output voltage , and the switch duty ratio @xmath0 can be derived from , for instance , the waveform of the inductor voltage @xmath13 ( ) . according to faraday s law , the volt - second product for the inductor over a period of steady - state operation should be zero . for the buck converter , @xmath14 from eq .",

    "( [ eq : buck02 ] ) that the output voltage is always smaller than the input voltage .",
    "the ccm is preferred over the dcm because it provides higher efficiency and makes better use of semiconductor switches and passive components .",
    "the dcm may be used in applications with special control requirements , since the dynamic order of the converter is reduced ( the energy stored in the inductor is zero at the beginning and end of each switching period ) .",
    "it is uncommon to mix these two operating modes , because different control algorithms are needed . for the buck converter",
    ", the critical value of the inductance which is needed for ccm operation is @xmath16    the current @xmath12 in the filter inductor in the ccm consists of a dc component @xmath17 with a superimposed triangular ac component .",
    "almost all of this ac component flows through the filter capacitor as a current @xmath18 .",
    "the current @xmath18 causes a small voltage ripple in the dc output voltage @xmath19 . to limit the peak - to - peak value of the ripple voltage below a certain value @xmath20",
    ", the filter capacitance @xmath10 must be greater than @xmath21    equations ( [ eq : buck03 ] ) and ( [ eq : buck04 ] ) are the key design equations for the buck converter .",
    "the input and output dc voltages ( and , hence , the duty ratio @xmath0 ) and the range of the load resistance @xmath11 are usually determined by preliminary specifications .",
    "the designer needs to determine the values @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the passive components , and the switching frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the value @xmath9 of the filter inductor is calculated from the ccm / dcm condition using eq .",
    "( [ eq : buck03 ] ) .",
    "the value @xmath10 of the filter capacitor is obtained from the voltage ripple condition ( eq . ( [ eq : buck04 ] ) ) . for compactness and low conduction losses in the converter",
    ", it is desirable to use small passive components .",
    "equations ( [ eq : buck03 ] ) and ( [ eq : buck04 ] ) show that this can be accomplished by using a high switching frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the switching frequency is limited , however , by the type of semiconductor switches used and by switching losses .",
    "it should also be noted that values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 may be altered by the effects of parasitic components in the converter , especially the equivalent series resistance of the capacitor .",
    "whether the converter operates in the ccm or the dcm depends on the load on the converter .",
    "if the value of the output resistance increases beyond the value used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : buck03 ] ) , the converter starts to operate in the dcm .",
    "figure [ fig : buck_dcm01](a ) shows the waveforms of the inductor voltage @xmath22 and inductor current @xmath12 at the edge of the ccm .",
    "the value of the output current @xmath23 is also shown in the plot .",

    "input voltage ratio under dcm conditions can be calculated using the waveforms in ( b ) .",
    "the volt - second product over a period should be zero for a steady - state condition .",
    "therefore @xmath26 @xmath27 the output current is the average of the inductor current @xmath28 over the period @xmath6 : @xmath29 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : buck_dcm02 ] ) and ( [ eq : buck_dcm04 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : buck_dcm03 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath30 from eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 13 ) , @xmath31    figure [ fig : buck_dcm03 ] shows the characteristics of the buck converter for both modes of operation .",
    "the voltage ratio is plotted versus the output current for several duty cycles .",
    "the boundary between the dcm and ccm is shown by the dashed curve .",
    "the second topology to be analysed is the step - up , or boost , converter .",
    "it receives this name because the output voltage is always higher than the input voltage .",
    "figure [ fig : boost01 ] depicts a simple circuit diagram of a boost converter .",
    "this comprises a dc input voltage source @xmath7 , a boost inductor @xmath9 , a controlled switch @xmath8 , a diode @xmath0 , a filter capacitor @xmath10 , and a load resistance @xmath11 .",
    "the converter waveforms in the ccm are presented in .",
    "when the switch @xmath8 is in the ` on ' state , the current in the boost inductor increases linearly .",
    "the diode @xmath0 is off at this time .",
    "when the switch @xmath8 is turned off , the energy stored in the inductor is released through the diode into the output rc circuit .        using faraday s law for the boost inductor , @xmath32 from which the dc voltage transfer function turns out to be @xmath33 the boost converter operates in the ccm for @xmath34 , where @xmath35    the main waveforms of the boost converter are shown in .",
    "the current supplied to the rc output filter is discontinuous .",
    "thus , a larger output filter capacitor is required than in the buck converter in order to limit the output voltage ripple .",
    "the output filter capacitor must provide the dc current to the load when the diode @xmath0 is off .",
    "the minimum value of the filter capacitance that results in a voltage ripple @xmath20 is given by @xmath36      the last of the basic converter topologies is the buck  boost converter .",
    "a circuit diagram is shown in .",
    "this converter consists of a dc input voltage source @xmath7 , a controlled switch @xmath8 , an inductor @xmath9 , a diode @xmath0 , a filter capacitor @xmath10 , and a load resistance @xmath11 .",
    "while the switch @xmath8 is ` on ' , the inductor current increases and the diode is maintained ` off ' .",
    "when the switch is turned off , the diode provides a path for the inductor current .",
    "note the polarity of the diode , which results in its current being drawn from the output .",
    "for this reason , the output voltage polarity is negative .",
    "the waveforms for the buck  boost converter are depicted in .",
    "the condition for a zero volt - second product for the inductor in the steady state and the steady - state dc transfer function are given by the following equations : @xmath37 @xmath38 the critical value of the inductor that fixes the boundary between the ccm and dcm is given by @xmath39    the current that feeds the rc output filter is the same as that for the boost converter but in the reverse direction .",
    "hence the value of the capacitor is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : boost04 ] ) .",
    "one of the common features of the power converters presented in the previous section is that the output voltage depends on the duty cycle @xmath0 , which was defined as the ratio between @xmath40 and the total period of switching @xmath6 .",
    "changes in the duty cycle produce variations in the output voltage of the converter . in other words ,",
    "the output voltage can be controlled by changing the duty cycle .",
    "the analysis of a converter from the point of view of control can be performed using the switching function .",
    "the switching function is a mathematical tool to represent the state of a power converter . for the basic power converters described above",
    ", the switching function has two values .",
    "when the switch is on , the value of the switching function is unity , and when the switch is off , the value is zero : @xmath41    a block diagram of the control of a power converter is shown in .",
    "the block labelled `` modulator '' transforms an input signal @xmath42 into the switching function @xmath43 , which controls the switch in the power converter .",
    "the modulator block can be built in several different ways .",
    "it can be implemented using a few analog components or using sophisticated digital circuits .",
    "one of the most common applications of dc  dc converters is to provide a regulated output regardless of variations in the load and the input voltage .",
    "another source of variation in the output voltage is changes in the components of the power converter ; components can be affected by external factors such as temperature or ageing .",
    "the most common schemes used to regulate the output of power converters are presented in .",
    "the feedback scheme ( ( a ) ) uses information from the output to provide the signal @xmath42 to the modulator .",
    "the main advantage of this scheme is that a feedback controller receives information directly from the output voltage , which is the value intended to be regulated , and therefore it can compensate for all variations regardless of their source .",
    "a disadvantage is that feedback regulation can lead to instability in the converter .",
    "another disadvantage of the feedback scheme is that the output has to be affected in order to provide information to the feedback controller . in other words",
    ", the controller may not be fast enough to see a fluctuation and compensate for it .",
    "for example , a variation in the input voltage @xmath7 such as 100  hz ripple from the rectification stage could have an amplitude such that the feedback scheme can not completely reject it . in such cases a feedforward scheme , as shown in ( b ) , can be used .",
    "if it is known how the input voltage affects the output voltage ( the dc transfer function ) , a feedforward controller can provide a signal @xmath42 to the modulator that gives the correct value of the output voltage .",
    "the various ways of obtaining the switching function to be applied to the power converter are referred as control , or modulation , methods . a list and brief discussion of the most common methods",
    "are given in the following sections .",
    "this is the most popular method of controlling power converters . in this modulation method ,",
    "the period of the switching signal @xmath6 is constant and the information is contained in the width of the pulse , i.e. , the period of time for which the switching signal is on , @xmath40 .",
    "this method is also known as carrier - based pulse width modulation .",
    "the switching function for constant - frequency pwm can be obtained by comparing the signal @xmath42 with a carrier signal @xmath44 as depicted in .",
    "figure [ fig : pwm01 ] shows an analog implementation of a pwm modulator . in digital implementations , the carrier is replaced by a counter / timer block . in both types of implementation , a way to avoid multiple transitions within a carrier period needs to be added .",
    "variable - frequency pwm , although not as popular as constant - frequency pwm , is also used in practice .",
    "the common variations of variable - frequency pwm are the constant - off - time / variable - on - time and constant - on - time / variable - off - time versions .",
    "figure [ fig : pwm02 ] shows the waveform for constant - off - time / variable - on - time pwm using a sawtooth - like carrier signal .",
    "the switch is turned on after a fixed time ; at this point , the sawtooth signal starts to rise at a constant rate .",
    "the switch is turned off again when the sawtooth signal intersects the signal @xmath42 . after the turn - off of the switch ,",
    "the carrier is reset to zero for a fixed period of time .",
    "the figure shows that the on time increases and the switching frequency decreases when the signal @xmath42 is increased , resulting in variable - frequency operation .",
    "constant - on - time / variable - off - time pwm can be implemented in a similar way .",
    "variable - frequency pwm is used in light - load operation of power converters in order to increase the efficiency of the converter under these conditions .",
    "the main disadvantage of this is the difficulty associated with the design of the input and output filters .",
    "the filter cut - off frequency has to be selected based on the lowest possible switching frequency in order to provide the required attenuation of ripple and electromagnetic interference ( emi ) under all possible operation conditions .",
    "this usually leads to a conservative design with significant volume and cost penalties .",
    "current mode control uses direct measurement of the inductor current to generate the switching function .",
    "one way of generating the switching function is to replace the sawtooth carrier waveform used to generate the pwm by the inductor current , as shown in ( b ) .",
    "the switching function is set to unity by a clock signal of period @xmath6 .",
    "when the inductor current reaches the value of the signal @xmath42 , the switching function is reset .",
    "figure [ fig : cm01](a ) shows a simple circuit for current mode pwm generation .",
    "the peak current mode method is inherently unstable at duty cycles higher than 0.5 , resulting in subharmonic oscillations . a compensating ramp ( with slope equal to the inductor current down - slope ) is usually applied to the comparator input to eliminate this instability .",
    "note that in current mode control , the output voltage is not directly controlled .",
    "an addition loop is needed in order to obtain a regulated output voltage .",
    "variable - structure control offers an alternative way to implement a switching function , which exploits the inherently variable nature of the structure of dc  dc converters . in practice",
    ", the converter switches are driven as a function of the instantaneous values of the voltages and currents .",
    "the most important feature of variable - structure control is its ability to provide robust control .",
    "although the study of variable - structure control is far beyond on the scope of this article , hysteresis control provides a very simple and intuitive example .",
    "sliding - mode control is other variable - structure control method for power converters reported in the literature .",
    "hysteresis control is based on comparing the output voltage @xmath45 with a reference voltage @xmath42 using a hysteresis comparator .",
    "if the voltage is lower than the upper limit of the comparator , the switch is turned off until the output voltage reaches the lower limit of the hysteresis comparator .",
    "when the voltage reaches this limit , the switch is turned on .",
    "figure [ fig : hyst01 ] shows a simple circuit diagram for hysteresis control , and typical waveforms .",
    "several different topologies have been derived from the basic dc  dc converters . in this section , three different groups of converters will be presented .",
    "the first group of converter topologies are isolated versions of the basic converters .",
    "the use of a transformer provides galvanic isolation between the input and output voltages .",
    "an additional advantage of the use of a transformer is an increase in the output voltage range of the converter due to the turns ratio of the transformer .",
    "the second group is formed by the flyback converter .",
    "this converter has galvanic isolation provided by coupled inductors .",
    "the difference between a transformer and coupled inductors is that in the latter case there is no direct energy flow from the input to the output .",
    "this fact limits the use of these converters to low - power applications .",

    "the output filter part of the circuit is the same as that in a buck converter .",
    "the square waveform of the transformer secondary is rectified and then filtered by the output stage .",
    "the voltage at the primary of the transformer is shown in .",
    "the voltage per second on the primary and secondary sides during the switching period has to be zero in order to avoid saturation of the transformer .        in this converter ,",
    "two capacitors act as an input voltage divider , which is connected to one of the inputs of the transformer .",
    "a two - polarity voltage is obtained by connecting the other input to @xmath7 or a reference voltage using the switches @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the switches operate shifted in phase by @xmath6/2 with the same duty ratio @xmath0 .",
    "the duty ratio must be smaller than 0.5 .",

    "the diode states are reversed when the switch @xmath47 is on . when both controllable switches are off , both diodes are on and share the filter inductor current equally .",
    "this short - circuits the transformer and forces the transformer input voltage to zero .",
    "the dc voltage transfer function of the half - bridge converter is given by the following equation : @xmath50          push  pull converters , like half - bridge converters , can be regarded as two single - switch buck converters running out of phase .",
    "a circuit diagram is shown in .",
    "the volts per second are balanced by alternating the operation of the switches @xmath46 and @xmath47 . similarly",
    "to the half - bridge converter , the output filter stage is the same as that in the buck converter .",
    "the main advantage of this topology is that both switches are connected to the reference voltage , which avoids the use of a floating driver for the switches .",
    "the main disadvantage is that differences in the period @xmath40 of the switches could lead to saturation of the transformer .",

    "energy is stored in the common magnetic core during the time @xmath40 of the switch @xmath8 and is then transferred to the output stage during the time @xmath59 .",
    "there is no direct energy transfer between the primary and secondary windings , unlike the converters mentioned above .",
    "this limits the application of this converter to low - power applications .",
    "the uk ( pronounced ` chook ' ) converter was introduced by slobodan uk of the california institute of technology .",
    "the circuit diagram of this converter is shown in .",
    "the main advantage of this converter is the continuous currents at the input and output of the converter .",
    "the main disadvantage is the high current stress on the switch .",

    "there are also versions of this converter in which the two inductors @xmath64 and @xmath65 are integrated into one magnetic element in order to reduce the cost and volume of the converter .    the list of converters presented in this section is not intended to be exhaustive .",
    "the converter topologies presented are just a small sample of the many topologies that have been reported in the literature .",
    "the right topology for each application depends on many factors , which include the stress on the semiconductors and passive components , the level of power to be transferred , and the switching frequency , among others .",

    "one component of most one - quadrant converter topologies is a diode .",
    "this diode is used to provide a path for the current when the main switch is turned off , or for rectification and providing a dc output .",
    "the conduction losses of the diode make an important contribution to the overall power loss of a converter , especially for low - output - voltage , high - output - current power converters .",
    "the conduction loss of a diode in a buck converter is given by the following equation : @xmath66 the overall efficiency due to the diode conduction loss can be expressed as @xmath67    for low - voltage power converters , this equation shows that the overall efficiency of the converter can drop to unacceptable levels .",
    "one way to increase the overall efficiency under these conditions is to replace the diode by a mosfet , as shown in .",
    "the mosfet introduces an almost linear resistance with a lower voltage drop .",
    "figure [ fig : synch02 ] shows the power loss in @xmath47 for a diode and for a mosfet .        :",
    "diode ( solid line ) and mosfet ( dashed line ) ]    in addition to minimizing conduction losses , mosfets offer the additional benefit that they can easily be paralleled because their @xmath68 has a positive temperature coefficient .",
    "the concept of paralleling several dc  dc power converters in order to increase the output power is well known in power electronics .",
    "a further step is to group the components together and control the resulting converter as a unit .",
    "interleaving is one of the techniques most often used , and provides several advantages such as an increase in the resulting switching frequency and a reduction in the component size .",
    "figure [ fig : inter01 ] shows the circuit diagram of an interleaved buck converter .",
    "the switching functions for the switches @xmath69 have the same switching frequency but there is a phase shift between them equal to @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of individual stages that form the converter .        the first plot in shows the output currents of the individual stages and the overall output current formed by addition of the inductor currents for each phase .",
    "the ripple frequency of the overall output current is @xmath71 times the frequency of the inductor phase currents .",

    "the requirements on the input capacitor are also reduced by the interleaving of the converters .",
    "figure [ fig : inter02](b ) shows the input current for each branch and the total input current .",
    "an increase in the frequency and a reduction in the rms value can be observed .",
    "figure [ fig : inter04 ] shows the normalized input capacitor rms current for different values of @xmath71 .",
    "one of the big advantages of operating a power converter in switched mode is that voltages across and currents through the switches are not present simultaneously during the ` on ' and ` off ' states .",
    "this can not be true , however , during the transitions between the states of the converter .",
    "the trajectories during the transitions determine whether the switches operate in a hard or soft switching mode .",
    "the switching trajectory of a hard - switched power device is shown in . during the turn - on and turn - off processes ,",
    "the power device has to withstand high voltages and currents simultaneously , resulting in high switching losses and stress .",
    "the switching losses are proportional to the operating frequency of the converter and are usually the main factor that limits the operating frequency .",
    "another disadvantage of hard - switching operation is an increase in high - frequency emissions , which produce emi .",
    "dissipative passive snubbers are usually added to power circuits in order to reduce the @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the power devices , and the switching losses and stresses can be diverted to these passive snubber circuits .",
    "figure [ fig : snubbers ] shows how the transition trajectory is modified by the presence of an rc snubber .",
    "the @xmath72 of the switch is reduced during the turn - off and part of the transition energy is transferred to the dissipative element of the snubber .",
    "the snubber design has to be done carefully in order to correctly dimension the components and ensure proper operation .",
    "more complex snubber circuits have the ability to recover the transition energy and increase the overall efficiency of the converter .",
    "a further step can be taken to reduce the commutation losses by operating the switches in a soft switching mode .",
    "the basic idea of soft switching can be explained using the plots in .",
    "the voltage across the switch is forced to be zero while the current is dropping .",
    "when the current is zero , the switch voltage starts to rise until the switch reaches the turn - off state .",
    "the losses during the transition are zero .",
    "a simple circuit operating in a soft switching mode is shown in .",
    "the switch @xmath74 opens with zero voltage across its terminals because this voltage is maintained by the capacitor @xmath60 .",
    "the voltage @xmath75 drops because the inductor current charges and discharges the capacitors @xmath60 and @xmath76 .",
    "once the voltage reaches zero , the diode @xmath49 starts to carry current and k-eps-converted-to.pdf the voltage close to zero . during the period of time that the diode is conducting ,",
    "the switch @xmath77 is turned on .",
    "the positive transition of voltage @xmath75 is produced in a similar way .",
    "the trend in power electronics is towards an increase in efficiency , power , and component density .",
    "for this reason , resonant converters have received special interest in recent years .",
    "these converters have the potential to operate at higher frequencies and with lower switching losses than hard - switching converters .",
    "the design of resonant converters and their control presents challenges different from those for other converters .",
    "in particular , the control of these converters is usually done by frequency modulation instead of pulse width modulation .",
    "although a comprehensive analysis of dc resonant converters is far beyond the scope of this article , a brief description of their functional principles is given here .",
    "all of the resonant - converter topologies operate in essentially the same way .",
    "the power switches generate a square wave voltage or current , which is applied to a resonant circuit .",
    "energy circulates in the resonant circuit , and part of this energy is transferred to the output .",
    "the two basic types of resonant converter are the series resonant converter , shown in ( a ) , and the parallel resonant converter , shown in ( b ) . in both topologies ,",
    "the energy transferred to the output is regulated by changing the frequency of the driving voltage .",
    "the resonant circuit forms a voltage divider with the resistor @xmath11 . by changing the frequency ,",
    "the impedance of the resonant circuit and therefore the output voltage can be varied .",
    "the circuits shown in have limitations .",
    "the series resonant converter can not work under very light load conditions , because the operating frequency would have to be very high in order to regulate the output voltage .",
    "the parallel resonant converter requires large amounts of circulating current when operating under heavy load conditions .      to overcome the limitations of the resonant converters shown in",
    ", converters combining series and parallel topologies have been proposed .",
    "figure [ fig : resonant02](a ) shows a topology which includes two capacitors and one inductor .",
    "this topology is named the lcc resonant converter .",
    "the topology formed by two inductors and one capacitor ( the llc resonant converter ) is shown in ( b ) .",
    "this topology has several advantages over the lcc topology .",
    "for instance , the two inductors can be integrated into one physical magnetic component , and it also provides galvanic isolation .    a simplified circuit diagram of an llc resonant converter is shown in .",
    "the two inductors are the magnetizing and leakage inductances of a transformer .",
    "the llc topology has the additional advantage of being able to operate in a soft switching mode .",
    "this allows the switching frequency and power density of the converter to be increased .",
    "the typical waveforms for an llc resonant converter are shown in .",
    "soft commutation is achieved in a similar way to that described in .",
    "one - quadrant power converters play an important role in industrial and consumer electronics applications .",
    "almost every electronic circuit is supplied with a dc voltage provided by some kind of power converter . if a regulated voltage is needed , this converter usually consists of a rectifier stage followed by a regulated dc  dc power converter .",
    "the field of power converters for particle accelerators is no exception to this trend . as was mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "one - quadrant power converters are used to generate the high - precision , stable currents needed for storage ring accelerator magnets .",
    "the topologies used in this application depend on the power level required .",
    "this article was intended to be an introduction to this broad subject .",
    "all the topics discussed here are covered in depth in books on power converters and in journal and conference papers .",
    "the references provided at the end of this article should be a good starting point for further studies ."
