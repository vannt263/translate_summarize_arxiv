    "entanglement is not only one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics , it also plays a crucial role in the field of quantum information @xcite .",
    "entangled states are important resources for most applications of quantum information such as quantum key distribution @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum error correction @xcite etc .",
    "although the best performance of such tasks requires maximally entangled states ( bell states ) , the decoherence effects due to the environment make the pure entangled state into a statistical mixture and degrade quantum entanglement in the real word . for a practical purpose ,",
    "a purification scheme may be applied to the degraded entanglement @xcite .",
    "one of the most important degraded bell states is werner state @xcite , a werner state in @xmath0 system takes the following form @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the @xmath3 identity matrix and @xmath4 is the singlet state of the four bell states @xmath5 the werner state @xmath6 is characterized by a single real parameter @xmath7 called fidelity .",
    "this quantity measures the overlap of werner state with a bell state . in the case where @xmath8 , the state is separable , and",
    "thus has no entanglement to recover or maintain . and a werner state with @xmath9 violates the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite .",
    "there are many theoretical investigations on werner state @xcite , and the werner state plays an important role in entanglement purification @xcite , nonlocality @xcite , entanglement measure @xcite and etc . however , there is no report of experimental realization of werner state to date . at present",
    ", the most accessible and controllable source of entanglement is obtained from the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion in a nonlinear crystal . in this paper , we present an experimental preparation of bi - photon werner state via spontaneous parametric down - conversion and the prepared state is in the form @xmath10 which can be transformed to @xmath6 by a local unitary transformation of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is one of pauli operators and @xmath13 is the identity operator .",
    "there are previous works on preparing mixed single photon or bi - photon state like in ref .",
    "a. g. white _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have reported an optical two - qubit source that can produce a wide range of states in the form @xmath14 c. zhang @xcite has proposed a theoretical protocol to produce an arbitrary two - bit mixed state by using beam splitters with variable polarization transmission coefficients and single - mode optical fibers . however , in this paper , we propose a different way to prepare werner states conveniently in experiment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the experimental set - up is described .",
    "the experimental results is given in sec .",
    "iii and the discussion and summary is given in sec .",
    "in our experiment , the werner state is bi - photon s polarization state , which is obtained by mixing a complete mixed state and an entangled state .",
    "the experimental set - up is depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the 1.7-mm - diam pump beam at 351.1 nm ( single line , 100 mw ) is produced by an argon ion laser ( coherent , sabre , model dbw25/7 ) , and directed to the first bbo ( beta - barium borate ) crystal ( cut for type - i phase matching , optic axis cut at @xmath15 , 1 mm thick ) after passing through a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) to give a pure horizontal polarization state . two entangled photon beams ( polarized in vertical direction ) produced by the bbo crystal passing through a sequence of quartz plates , with an optic axis set in the diagonal direction .",
    "it is pointed out that the photon polarization state will decohere in such an environment @xcite .",
    "the thickness of quartz plates is set in such a way that the photon s polarization decoheres completely ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , the difference between optical path of horizontal and vertical optical polarizations in the quartz plates is @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the central wave length of the down - converted light . ) .",
    "the remained pump beam passes through the bbo crystal and is rotated to @xmath18 by a half - wave plate ( hwp ) and is transmitted through the second bbo crystal which is the same as that proposed by kwiat in ref .",
    "@xcite to produce polarization - entangled photons in such a state .",
    "the down - converted light beams produced by the first bbo were reflected by four reflectors and passed through the second bbo crystal to be mixed with the down - converted beams produced in the second bbo .",
    "note the reason that the pump was set in single line instead of single frequency is to decrease the coherent length ( about 4 cm in our experiment ) of the pump light and avoid the interference between the down - converted light beams from the two bbo crystals .",
    "* figure 1 . *    at the end , the bi - photon polarization state is measured tomgraphically @xcite by quarter - wave plates ( qwp ) , hwp and pbs .",
    "we use 16 analyzer settings as listed in table i. the photons are detected by using silicon avalanche photodiodes ( eg&g , spcm - aqr ) operated in the geiger mode .",
    "each detector is preceded by a small iris ( the diameter is 1.5 mm ) to define the spatial mode , a narrowband interference filter ( if ) centered at 702 nm ( andover , 050fc46 - 25/7022 @xcite , full width at half is equal to 4.62 nm ) to reduce background and define the bandwidth of the photons , and a collection lens .",
    "the detector outputs are recorded in coincidence with a time - to - amplitude converter and a single - channel analyzer , leading to an effective coincidence window of 5 ns .",
    "the resulting rate of accidental coincidences is less than @xmath19s@xmath20 , which can be neglected compared with the typical rate of the true coincidences , which is about @xmath21s@xmath20 .",
    "we also test whether the states produced by this set - up violate the chsh inequality .",
    "this inequality shows that @xmath22 for any local realistic theory , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the coincidence rate of two detectors when the polarization analyzer angels are set in @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in this experiment",
    ", we selected the settings : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we can adjust the intensity proportion ( it can be tuned by adjusting the position of the reflectors ) between the down - converted light from two bbo crystals to obtain werner states with different coefficients @xmath37 .",
    "two output states have been produced in this experiment , for one of them the chsh inequality is violated while the other is not .    the tomographic results are shown in table i.    * table i. *    from the data in the third column of table i we can obtain the density matrix of the first output state directly , however , it is not non - negative definite @xcite . we have used the maximum likelihood estimation @xcite to construct a non - negative definite density matrix @xmath38 the fit werner state @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 ) satisfies @xmath41 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary two - bit werner state and the fidelity @xcite @xmath42 is equal to @xmath43 in this experiment . the chsh correlation value [ eq .",
    "( 3 ) ] @xmath44 , ( the uncertainty of the hwp is @xmath45 ) which violates the chsh inequality .",
    "the theoretical value of @xmath46 of state @xmath47 is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "the tomographic results of the second output are shown in the sixth column of table i. from these data we can obtain the density matrix of the second output state @xmath49 the fit werner state is @xmath50 where @xmath51 and the fidelity @xmath52 is equal to @xmath53 .",
    "the chsh correlation value @xmath54 , which satisfies the chsh inequality .",
    "the theoretical value of @xmath46 of state @xmath55 is equal to @xmath56 .",
    "we should note that there is significant difference in count rates between the two sets of results . in our experiment ,",
    "the intensity proportion of down - converted light beams between two bbo crystals is tuned by adjusting the position of the reflectors .",
    "so the length of down - converted photon s optical path between the source and the detector has been changed for preparing the second state . therefore , the count rates have been decreased significantly .",
    "we can use the `` linear entropy '' to quantify the degree of mixture of a quantum state and use the tangle to measure the degree of entanglement of a two - bit quantum state @xcite .",
    "the linear entropy for a two - bit system is defined by @xmath57 the tangle is defined as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the concurrence in ref . @xcite . in this experiment , for the first density matrix in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and for the second density matrix in eq . ( 7 ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we have prepared two typical werner states in this experiment and measured the density matrix tomographically .",
    "two independent bbo crystals are used to produce parametric down - conversion light beams which can be mixed to prepare a wide range of two - bit quantum states . in our experiment ,",
    "the intensity proportion of down - converted light beams between two bbo crystals are tuned by adjusting the position of the reflectors .",
    "in fact , the proportion can be tuned with linear optical elements , which is shown in fig .",
    "2 .      although the output light beams were produced by classically mixing ( not quantum superposing ) the down - converted light beams , it is hard ( but not in principle ) to distinguish from which crystals the output photon is produced since the pump light is continuous .",
    "however , if we use the pulse pump we can distinguish which crystal the output photon from by measuring the photon s arrival time , that is , we can distill the classical information of the mixed state and it can be regarded as a pure state .",
    "we expect that this method can be modified to prepare arbitrary two - bit states conveniently and this source can be used in experimental investigation of entanglement purification or other quantum information tasks .",

    ", the non - dissipative coupling between photon frequency and polarization in a birefringent media leads to decoherence of polarization , provided we regard the freedom of frequency as `` environment''@xcite .",
    "the single - photon s initial state is described by a pure product state of polarization and frequency , @xmath64 with basis @xmath65 ( horizontal polarization ) and @xmath66 ( vertical polarization ) denoted by @xmath67 respectively , and @xmath68 is the complex amplitude corresponding to @xmath69 , normalized so that @xmath70 after being transmitted by the birefringent medium whose length is @xmath37 , the final state of the photon is @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is the refractive index of horizontal ( vertical ) polarization .",
    "it is necessary to note that although @xmath72 and @xmath73 are dependent on frequency @xmath69 , the value of @xmath74 does not vary obviously with frequency varying in a small scale and we regard it as constant .",
    "the density operator of the polarization state can be obtained by tracing over frequency degrees of freedom from the complete density operator @xmath75 where @xmath76      the spectrum of the photon s frequency is defined by the narrowband interference filter ( if ) . in this experiment ,",
    "the spectrum of the photon s frequency is rectangular function . to obtain this environment",
    ", we use an interference filter whose spectrum s shape is approximate to rectangle and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is @xmath77 nm . ( andover , 050fc46 - 25/7022 @xcite ) .",

    "4 . the coherence of the photon s polarization degenerates as theoretical expected .. it is interesting that the coherence is recovered to some extent after it degenerated completely , which is similar to the fraunhofer diffraction at a rectangular aperture ( or slit ) @xcite .",
