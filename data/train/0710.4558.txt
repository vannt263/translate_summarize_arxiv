    "first recognized via their close relationship between atpase activity and organelle transport along mts @xcite , kinesins have received broad attention as a prototype of molecular motors for the last two decades .",
    "recent single molecule ( sm ) experiments have shown that , with each stepping motion being strongly coupled to the atp , the kinesin moves toward the ( + ) -ends of mts by taking discrete 8-nm steps @xcite in a hand - over - hand fashion @xcite . although the ultimate understanding to the kinesin s motility is still far from the completion , the sm experiments @xcite together with the series of kinetic ensemble measurements @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite begin providing glimpses to the physical principle of how kinesin walks .    along the kinesin s mechanochemical cycle ( si fig .",
    "7 ) , one of the main observations of the sm experiments is the stepping dynamics that enables the kinesin to move forward . the actual time spent for the stepping motion itself ( @xmath5 @xmath1 ) , compared to the atp binding and hydrolysis ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) , is however too short to detect the details of the dynamics with the spatial and temporal resolution of current instruments . thus , it is still difficult to answer many basic questions @xcite related to the stepping dynamics .",
    "some of those questions are : ( a ) during the 8-nm step , how does the swiveling motion of the tethered head occur ?",
    "does any detectable substep exist that reflects a transient intermediate ?",
    "@xcite ( b ) what fraction of the time and length scales is contributed from the power stroke and the diffusional search ?",
    "( c ) does the kinesin walk parallel to the single pf or walk astride using two parallel pfs ?",
    "@xcite to shed light on these questions , we propose to take advantage of the native topology of kinesins and mts .",
    "for instance , our previous study has clarified the regulation mechanism between the two heads @xcite by using the native topology - based two - head bound model of kinesin on the mt @xcite .",
    "following the same line of thought , we show that even the dynamical pathways of kinesins reflect `` the topological constraints emanating from the molecular architecture . '' in the present work , we have adapted our previous two - head bound model @xcite to study the stepping dynamics of kinesins on the 13-pf mt .",
    "according to the `` neck - linker docking model @xcite , '' the stepping motion of kinesin is initiated by the undocked - to - docked transition of the neck - linker at the mt - bound head ( power stroke ) , and the rest of the binding process of the tethered head to the next mt - binding site is accomplished via a diffusional search .",
    "the whole stepping dynamics is typically interpreted as a combination between the directional motion of power stroke and the nondirectional diffusional search . at the molecular level ,",
    "the length of the neck - linker shrinks gradually , with a progress of power stroke , making transition from a disordered to an ordered state ; the resulting configurations bias the diffusional motion of the tethered head in one direction .",
    "thus , we can rather interpret the power stroke as a time dependent boundary condition that biases the diffusional motion , considering that the tethered head diffuses on the time dependent energy landscape to search for the next mt - binding site .",
    "to study the dynamics , we first obtain through simulations potentials of mean force ( pmf ) felt by the kinesin s tethered head on the mt at two extreme cases ; one is the pmf with fully disordered neck - linker ( @xmath8 ) and the other with ordered neck - linker ( @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 is a parameter that specifies the degree of the neck - linker being zippered .",
    "the kinesin structures with a disordered ( @xmath11 ) and an ordered neck - linker ( @xmath12 ) at the mt - bound head are generated by switching on and off the native contacts inside the green circles in fig .",
    "1b ( see results and methods for more details ) .",
    "we subsequently perform brownian dynamics simulations of a quasi - particle representing the tethered head on a pmf that is mixed between the two extreme cases .",
    "the disordered - to - ordered transitions are mimicked by mixing the two pmfs , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in a time - dependent manner .",
    "we show that because of the multiple binding sites on the mt surface , the tethered head has a chance of misbinding to other mt - binding sites .",
    "to avoid such an intermediate , we argue that the rate of power stroke ( @xmath2 ) should be faster than the sampling rate on the mt surface ( @xmath13 ) . throughout the paper , we designate the rate of power stroke and the rate of space exploration by diffusion as @xmath2 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the present work provides scenarios on how the dynamic pathways of the tethered head depends on the rate of the power stroke , based on the landscape of stepping and the molecular details that the current experiment can not easily access .",
    "importantly , the present work will give further insights to resolve the recent experimental debate @xcite on the existence of a substep within the kinesin s 8-nm step .",
    "* topological constraints in stepping dynamics .",
    "* upon atp binding to the empty mt - bound head ( positioned at the binding site @xmath14 in fig .",
    "1a ) , the allosteric communication between the strained nucleotide binding pocket and the disordered neck - linker leads to the docking of the neck - linker to the @xmath15 and @xmath16 neck - linker binding motifs . as a result ,",
    "the tethered head swings forward from one mt - binding site ( @xmath17 in fig .",
    "1a ) to the other ( @xmath18 in fig .",
    "1a ) while the mt - bound head remains at the same position ( see si fig . 8 for the snapshots of a kinesin during the stepping ) . for the tethered head to bind to the mt - binding site",
    ", the ruggedly shaped kinesin head having specific mt - binding motifs should explore the mt surface and fit into the mt - binding site in a right orientation under topological constraints .",
    "the two neck - linkers ( one from the mt - bound head , and the other from the tethered head ) and the steric hindrance between the two heads restrain the search space available for the tethered head .",
    "the topology of mt also makes unique the association process between the tethered head and the mt - binding site . in the mt made of 13 pfs @xcite the lateral binding interfaces between the adjacent pfs",
    "are shifted by @xmath19 nm , which makes the mt helical ( fig .",
    "the distances between the diagonally located tubulins become asymmetric ( @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 ) .",
    "the distance between the interfaced tubulins at the side ( @xmath23 nm ) is shorter than the distance between the tubulins along the same pf ( @xmath24 nm ) . in light of the contour length of a neck - linker ( 15 @xmath25 nm@xmath26 @xmath27 nm ) , two fully extended neck linkers ( @xmath28 nm )",
    "allow the tethered head to cover a wide range of the mt surface .",
    "since every mt - binding site on the mt equally interacts with the tethered head , one can not totally rule out the possibility of binding to the neighboring pfs while the experiments suggest that the kinesin move straight along the mt @xcite . + * pmf between kinesin tethered head and mt . * during the disordered - to - ordered transition , the length of disordered neck - linker decreases gradually .",
    "depending on the length of the disordered neck - linker , there are substantial variations in the search space available for the tethered head ( fig .",
    "2a and fig .",
    "we sample the conformational space using the centroid of tethered head from the multiple trajectories with varying temperatures ( see methods for the energy function ) , and calculate the 2-d pmf between the tethered head and the mt , projected on the xy , xz- , yz - planes , at two extreme cases ( see si text for the computational details of pmf construction ) .",
    "one results from search processes under which the neck - linker of mt - bound head is practically in the zippered state ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we expect that this process is realized when the neck - linker zippering rate is faster than the rate of space exploration ( @xmath29 ) . whereas , the other results from the case when the neck - linker is in disordered state throughout the search process ( @xmath30 , @xmath11 ) . although the exact values of @xmath2 and @xmath13 are not known , we presume that the stepping dynamics should occur on a pmf linking between these two regimes .    from the structures with @xmath12 , we find two major basins of attraction in the 3-d space ( fig .",
    "2 ) . one is the mt - binding site @xmath18 and the other is a broad basin ( @xmath31 ) formed at the forward - right corner relative to the mt - bound head ( fig .",
    "2c , @xmath32 ) . between the two basins exists the free energy barrier of @xmath33 @xmath34 in @xmath32 or @xmath35 , and @xmath36 @xmath34 in @xmath37 , depending on the projection .",
    "the basin @xmath31 stems from the large conformational degrees of freedom that the tethered head should explore before reaching the binding site @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "2c , circles in blue ) .",
    "the energetic bias to the binding site @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "2c , arrows in magenta ) is also present , but is negligible ( @xmath39 @xmath34 ) . with an increasing temperature the stability of basin @xmath31 relative to the binding site @xmath18 increases , which indicates that the nature of the broad basin is entropic ( fig .",
    "note that the 1-d free energy profiles ( fig .",
    "2b ) projected from higher dimensional representation of free energy surface underestimates the barrier height by merging the various possible dynamic pathways .    from the structures with @xmath11 , which is obtained by making repulsive the attractive neck - linker zipper contacts ( the native contacts inside the green circles of fig .",
    "1b , see also methods ) , we find that the most frequently visited binding site is the site @xmath40 that belongs to the adjacent pf ( fig .",
    "3 ) . explicit analysis on the bound complex shows that the binding of the tethered head to the site @xmath40 is not as complete as the one to the site @xmath18 .",
    "interestingly , the structure at @xmath40 has only @xmath41 of the interfacial native contacts ( see fig .",
    "we find that a strained neck - linker induces a significant distortion in the @xmath42 helix , preventing a full binding . + * modeling the stepping dynamics . *",
    "the most straightforward strategy to monitor the real - time stepping dynamics of our model is to integrate the equation of motion for each coarse - grained unit of kinesin molecule in an overdamped environment . the inclusion of hydrodynamics to the simulations , which is essential to naturally retrieve a correct behavior of the translational diffusion for the tethered head ( see si text with si fig .",
    "9 ) , is however computationally too expensive for a model with more than 700 coarse - grained units .",
    "thus , we take an alternative method to study the real - time dynamics by using the two pmfs obtained above .    conceptually , the stepping dynamics coupled to the power stroke is considered as a diffusional process with a moving reflecting boundary condition that restrains the search space , which is illustrated in fig .",
