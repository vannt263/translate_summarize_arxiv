    "the results reproduce successfully the behavior observed in the numerical simulation of the ka and gravity - driven ka model , and they could be relevant to systems for which steric hindrance and cage effect are dominant , such as polydispersed colloidal suspension in gravitational field  @xcite , and slowly compacting dense granular matter .",
    "for hard - sphere systems it is known that the diffusion coefficient vanishes as a power - law with @xmath57 between @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the sedimentation profile is approached very slowly ( one year , roughly )  @xcite ; hence a super - aging behavior in the two - times mean - square height displacement with exponent @xmath93 between @xmath94 and @xmath91 should be observed .",
