    "the central regions of disc galaxies host bulges whose nature ( or absence ) must be explained by any model of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a bulge is a physical protrusion of stars above and below the plane of the disc and/or an excess of light above the inwards extrapolation of the radial exponential profile of the disc .",
    "there are three principal observational classes of bulges : classical bulges , pseudobulges , and boxy or peanut - shaped bulges ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "classical bulges have dynamical and photometric properties and stellar populations that are similar to elliptical galaxies of the same mass @xcite and are thought to be the end products of the same formation processes : either monolithic collapse ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) or multiple hierarchical mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "pseudobulges have embedded spiral structure , disc - like near - exponential light profiles , flattened axial ratios , and rotation - dominated dynamics ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "they are thought to be secularly rearranged disc material that was driven inwards by bars , ovals and possibly spiral arms .",
    "the observational constraints on the stellar populations of pseudobulges are less strong because studies have focussed on bigger and brighter classical bulges , decomposing their extended star formation history is more complicated than in classical bulges and ellipticals , and dust is a significant problem for the late - type discs in which pseudobulges are more usually found .",
    "nevertheless , the available population data are not strongly inconsistent with the secular model ( @xcite , but see the pilot sample of @xcite ) .",
    "an important third class of bulge , and the focus of this paper , is the boxy and peanut - shaped bulges , which are present in about half of edge - on disc galaxies @xcite .",
    "their major - axis stellar and gas kinematics @xcite and light profiles @xcite are consistent with simulations of the formation and buckling of galactic bars @xcite and point to them being bars viewed in projection .",
    "peanut - shaped bulges are thought to be bars whose orientation is exactly perpendicular to the line - of - sight , while boxy bulges are seen in galaxies whose bar is at an intermediate angle .",
    "bars oriented exactly parallel to the line - of - sight do not appear boxy or peanut - shaped . in that sense ,",
    "boxy and peanut - shaped bulges are not the axisymmetric features normally thought of as ` bulges ' .",
    "since the dominant model is that they are bars , which are not the end products of collapse or merger , but rather redistributed disc material , boxy bulges are also sometimes referred to as pseudobulges .",
    "however , for the purposes of clarity in the present paper , we avoid this , since boxy bulges are truly thick .    in the absence of transformational mergers , bars , which are found in two - thirds of disc galaxies @xcite , are expected to play a crucial and perhaps dominant role in disc galaxy evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "boxy and peanut - shaped bulges therefore provide a unique perspective on a feature that is crucial for understanding galaxy evolution . by observing them above the plane of the disc",
    ", one can determine the intrinsic properties of bars in a way that is almost free of thin disc light pollution .",
    "moreover , the observed dynamics of bars as a function of height above the plane is a crucial additional constraint on models of the nature of bulges , including ruling out the presence of a dynamically hot classical bulge / merger remnant .",
    "for example , @xcite modelled the line - of - sight mean velocity and velocity dispersion of m giant stars observed by the brava survey in the milky way bulge @xcite .",
    "they placed an extremely low upper limit on the mass of any hot spheroid component , @xmath17% ; i.e. the milky way appears to be a pure disc galaxy ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "giant pure disc galaxies present an acute challenge for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps the most unusual property of dynamical models of bars viewed in projection is that , within the bulge , the rotational velocity does not change with height ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "that is to say , lines of constant velocity are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the major axis , such that @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the line - of - sight velocity and @xmath4 is along the minor axis of the ( edge - on ) galaxy .",
    "this unusual behaviour was first observed in the boxy bulge of ngc  4565 by @xcite , who named it ` cylindrical rotation ' .",
    "it has since been noted in the following eight galaxies , all of which have a bulges that is , more or less , boxy : ngc  128 @xcite , ngc  3069 @xcite , ngc  1055 @xcite , ngc  4442 @xcite , ngc  7332 @xcite , ngc  4220 and ngc  4425 @xcite , and the milky way @xcite . in simulations ,",
    "all bulges that rotate cylindrically are boxy or peanut - shaped , but not all boxy or peanut - shaped rotate cylindrically @xcite .",
    "cylindrical rotation is not present ( or has not been reported ) in simulated unbarred galaxies , or in observations of classical bulges , where rotational velocity falls systematically with height within the bulge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sauron ] for two illustrative examples from the sauron sample ; @xcite ) .    in our search of the literature",
    ", we found no observations of the absence of cylindrical rotation in a boxy bulge .",
    "one of the goals of the present targeted study of boxy bulges is to determine whether this is confirmation bias , or whether cylindrical rotation is truly ubiquitous in boxy bulges and therefore a requisite property of all realistic models of bars .",
    "the extent or absence of cylindrical rotation in boxy bulges would be of interest because it might constrain the concentration of the dark haloes @xcite .",
    "our second goal is to examine the stellar populations of boxy bulges .",
    "the null hypothesis might be that , since bars are secularly rearranged disc material ( rather than material accreted or formed during rapid mergers ) , the metallicities of boxy bulges should be similar to those of their host discs . if , however , the metallicities of boxy bulges differ from those of their discs , or if they have metallicity gradients , this is not necessarily a problem for the bar buckling scenario . as pointed out by @xcite , the stars that have been scattered furthest from the disc are the oldest stars , and therefore formed from the least metal - enriched fuel",
    ". the buckling process may therefore establish a negative minor - axis metallicity gradient .",
    "indeed , such behaviour is observed in the milky way @xcite and in ngc  4565 , the archetypal boxy , cylindrically - rotating bulge @xcite .",
    "the strength of the metallicity gradient established in this way must be a function of both the rate of enrichment in the disc and the timescale over which the bar buckles and heats the disc .",
    "the process must also establish a corresponding positive age gradient .",
    "we know of no chemodynamical simulations of this process and , in particular , no prediction of the extent to which minor - axis gradients in boxy bulges are expected to differ from those in classical bulges .    moreover , we know of no prediction regarding the relative abundance of @xmath0-elements in boxy bulges .",
    "the naive expectation , however , is that the [ @xmath5  ratio of a boxy bulge should match that of its host disc .",
    "it is difficult to understand how secularly rearranged disc material could be segregated such that a boxy bulge of disc origin is @xmath0-enhanced with respect to its disc .",
    "@xmath5  ratios indicate that material was @xmath0-enriched by core collapse ( type ii ) supernovae before type ia supernovae fe - enrichment , which implies a formation timescale @xmath1 1gyr .",
    "bulges that are @xmath0-enhanced with respect to their disc therefore contains stars formed on much shorter timescales than the disc stars ( and not just at earlier times ) .",
    "if observed in a galaxy , this would suggest that its bulge is at least partially comprised of material formed in a merger or rapid collapse , or material of external origin .",
    "we discuss some of the issues that complicate this naive expectation in section  [ sec : discussion ]    in this paper we present a focussed spectroscopic analysis of the boxy bulges of five edge - on disc galaxies . in section  [ sec : observations ] we describe the sample , the data and their reduction .",

    "this measurement is correct at the sub - arcsec level for the major axis slit , but is uncertain by @xmath12arcsec away from the midplane , where the radial profile is noisy and weakly peaked . the central bin for each slit may therefore be a point that does not lie exactly on the minor axis .",
    "this uncertainty may introduce a small , systematic relative offset between the kinematic profiles derived for each slit .",
    "spectrophotometric flux standards were not observed during the observing runs , so that we are unable to precisely flux calibrate our data .",

    "the boxy bulge of ngc  3390 is a clear example of cylindrical rotation . within the uncertainties",
    ", it shows no systematic variation of rotational velocity as a function of height at all .",
    "the behaviour of the boxy bulge of eso  311g012 is close to cylindrical .",
    "the major - axis rotation is somewhat discrepant from that of the offset slits ; the rotation curve along the plane of the disc is ` double - humped ' , while those of the offset slits are not .",
    "this does not mean that the boxy bulge is not rotating cylindrically .",
    "the strong double - hump feature is seen in simulations of barred galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is likely the dynamical signature of bar - driven inward transport of material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which leads to the formation of a flattened round central excess of material , i.e. a pseudobulge .",
    "the distinguishing feature of cylindrical rotation is therefore that @xmath3 does not vary systematically with height away from the major axis , which is true of eso  311g012 . taken together , we interpret the presence of a double hump in the rotation curve along the major axis and cylindrical rotation in the offset slits as consistent with simulations of the formation and dynamics of bars @xcite .",
    "the classification of the type of rotation in the boxy bulge of ngc  1381 is marginal .",
    "the velocity along the major axis is extremely discrepant from that along the offset slits . the slits at 6  and 9are corotating , but the slit at 12  is of extremely low @xmath14 , and is binned to a correspondingly coarse spatial resolution .",
    "while this galaxy lacks the clear systematic decrease in @xmath3 with increasing @xmath4 seen in the examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : sauron ] , it is not a clean case of cylindrical rotation either .",
    "the same is true of the peanut - shaped bulge of ngc  5746 , but the picture is further complicated here by the rather irregular rotation curves within the bulge .",
    "this may be due to the prominent dust ` lane ' in ngc  5746 , which , because this galaxy is a few degrees away from edge - on obscures a fraction of the galaxy .",
    "strong absorption may cause the local mean line - of - sight velocity to differ significantly from the azimuthal velocity at the tangent point along the line - of - sight , and the extent of this difference may vary in a complicated way with distance along the minor axis .",
    "the peanut - shaped bulge of ic  4767 is not cylindrically rotating . at negative @xmath22 , even accounting for the uncertainties and the irregularity of the rotation curve , @xmath3 falls systematically with @xmath4 . at positive @xmath22",
    ", the signature of non - cylindrical rotation is less clear .",
    "cylindrical rotation is therefore not a ubiquitous feature of boxy and peanut - shaped bulges .",
    "there is also some evidence that it is less strong or even absent in peanut - shaped bulges compared to boxy bulges .",
    "it is worth considering whether this might have a dynamical origin . in simulations , bars in edge - on galaxies",
    "appear peanut - shaped when viewed with the bar perpendicular to the line - of - sight , and boxy when the bar is at an intermediate angle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "end - on bars appear neither boxy nor peanut - shaped .",
    "the velocity fields of these simulated galaxies vary with the orientation of the bar in the sense that the closer the bar is to end - on ( i.e. the less strongly peanut - shaped it appears ) , the more closely packed are the lines of constant velocity ( e.g. figure 6 of @xcite and figure 12 of @xcite )",
    ". there is , however , no clear sign of a systemic strengthening or weakening of cylindrical rotation as the viewing angle varies in these published studies .",
    "rather , the strength and extent of cylindrical rotation in the simulations of @xcite is a function of dark halo concentration in the sense that less concentrated dark haloes host boxy bulges in which cylindrical rotation is absent or less extended .    on a different note , in eso  311g012 , ngc  1381 , ngc  3390 and ngc  5746 ( i.e. all the galaxies with boxy or peanut - shaped bulges except ic  4767 ) , there is a general downwards trend in velocity dispersion with increasing height above the disc .",
    "this is most clear in eso  311g012 and ngc  5746 .",
    "this behaviour is also seen in classical bulges ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sauron ] ) , but the details of the variation of the velocity dispersion with height were crucial constraints in the milky way models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors placed an upper limit on the possible contribution of any dynamically hot spheroid component by comparing photometric and kinematic observations to dynamical models .",
    "their analysis implies that the milky way has , at most , an extremely low - mass classical bulge , i.e. it is a pure disc galaxy ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "without a comparison to dynamical models custom - made for each galaxy , which is beyond the scope of the present work , it is not possible here to draw such a strong conclusion on the basis of our velocity and dispersion profiles .",
    "the spatial variations of stellar population properties offer additional constraints on the nature and evolution of bulges .",
    "we therefore measured the strengths of the absorption lines present in our data ( h@xmath16 , fe5015 , mg@xmath23 , fe5270 , fe5335 and fe5406 ) in the lick / ids system @xcite and compared these to single stellar population ( ssp ) models , yielding ssp - equivalent luminosity - weighted ages , metallicities [ @xmath24  and @xmath0-element enhancement [ @xmath5 .    to make these measurements , we require high @xmath14 to reliably subtract nebular emission and",
    "thus accurately measure the absorption line properties .",
    "we therefore binned the major - axis slit into three large bins : a single bin for the bulge and two disc bins ( one from each side of the galaxy ) .",
    "we collapsed each of the three offset slits into a single bin dominated by bulge light ( rejecting the very small amount of thick disc light at larger galactocentric radii ) .",
    "this yields one bulge - dominated measurement from the centre of the bulge , two disc - dominated measurements along the major axis and three minor - axis bulge measurements at increasing galactic height . with data at four positions along the @xmath4-axis ,",
    "it is not really possible to quantify vertical gradients ( although as we discuss in the introduction , these are of interest ) .",
    "however , we can test our naive picture that a boxy bulge should have [ @xmath5  similar to that of its host disc .    of the absorption lines in our data ,",
    "only h@xmath16 provides a strong constraint on stellar age that is weakly dependent on metallicity @xcite , but this absorption feature is unfortunately often filled in by emission . to compare the population properties of galaxy discs and bulges ,",
    "we therefore restrict our analysis to those galaxies whose major - axis disc spectra are either free of emission or of sufficient @xmath14 to allow reliable subtraction of the h@xmath16 emission using gandalf @xcite .",
    "this is only true for ngc  1381 , which has no emission , and ngc  3390 .",
    "the analysis that follows is therefore restricted to those two galaxies only .",
    "we show an example gandalf fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : gandalf ] . the best fitting gandalf solution is comprised of the h@xmath16 and [ oiii ]  emission lines and a combination of flux - calibrated miles template stars that are convolved by a losvd and multiplied by a 6th order polynomial to account for the relative continuum differences between our setup and the miles library . to produce an emission - cleaned spectrum that can be used to measure absorption line properties and that can be compared to models",
    ", we subtract the gandalf emission lines from the observed spectrum and divide it by the 6th order polynomial , achieving a rough relative flux calibration . in practice ,",
    "the polynomial is extremely slowly varying and close to first order over the bandpasses of the lick indices , so this affects the measured line strengths at a level significantly below the uncertainties due to the noise .",
    "it is then possible to measure the strengths of the lines in the lick / ids system , which we do using the method of @xcite .",
    "but before these measurements are made , the spectra must be convolved with a wavelength - dependent gaussian to account for the difference between the spectral resolution of our setup and that of the lick / ids system .",
    "the resulting indices are further corrected for ( 1 ) the broadening effects of the galaxies velocity dispersions ( which generally reduce the strength of absorption features ) and ( 2 ) the small systematic offsets caused by , e.g. , the remaining differences between the continuum shapes our spectra and the lick / ids spectra .",
    "we apply the offsets from the miles system given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "this offset of course only affects the absolute value of the indices , not their spatial gradients .",
    "we use the line strengths to measure stellar population properties using the models of @xcite .",
    "these models incorporate non - solar [ @xmath5 . the best - fitting ssp - equivalent model for each spectrum is found by exploring an interpolated grid of model lick indices in age , [ @xmath24  and [ @xmath5  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we exclude fe5015 from this analysis .",
    "it is still sometimes contaminated by [ oiii]emission , it is close to the bad pixels on the ccd , and it covers an extremely wide bandpass so is subject to relatively large continuum systematics and lick offsets .",

    "we also note that [ @xmath5  in the bulge at large @xmath4 is greater than that in the disc bins ( and indeed the central bin of the major axis ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation of these results is that ngc  1381 is comprised of a disc and a bulge whose stars formed rapidly .",
    "this explains the general trend in [ @xmath5  as a function of height , as disc light ( with its lower [ @xmath5 ) contributes less and less to the integrated spectrum . in summary ,",
    "the bulge of ngc  1381 is chemically similar to that of classical bulges and elliptical galaxies .    given this classical bulge behaviour , how do we explain the boxy appearance of the bulge ?",
    "we speculate that this is a composite bulge : its chemical properties are explained by the presence of a classical bulge , but its appearance suggests the simultaneous presence of a bar ( which appears boxy in projection ) .",
    "this is consistent with the stellar rotation , neither cylindrical nor strongly non - cylindrical .",

    "we analysed the kinematics and stellar populations of the boxy or peanut - shaped bulges of a sample of five edge - on disc galaxies .",
    "one boxy bulge ( ngc  3990 ) rotates perfectly cylindrically , while another ( eso  311g012 ) is very close to cylindrical .",
    "it is not possible to cleanly classify the rotation in the boxy bulge of ngc  1381 or the peanut - shaped bulge of ngc  5746 .",
    "the strongly peanut - shaped bulge of ic  4767 is in normal rotation , the velocity falling systematically with height .",
    "cylindrical rotation is therefore not a ubiquitous behaviour in bulges that appear boxy or peanut - shaped .",
    "our sample is small and this work is exploratory , but we also tentatively note that cylindrical rotation may be less strong or even absent in peanut - shaped bulges , compared to boxy bulges . while this is not a prediction of simulations , models are able to qualitatively reproduce a case like ic  4767 by reducing the central concentration of the dark halo @xcite .",
    "low @xmath14 and the presence of emission are less of a problem when determining absorption line stellar kinematics than when measuring absorption line strengths .",
    "we were therefore only able to measure minor - axis trends in lick indices and derive luminosity - weighted ssp - equivalent age , [ @xmath24  and [ @xmath5  for two of the five galaxies .",
    "of these , ngc  3390 exhibits behaviour consistent with being a pure disc : there is no significant difference in [ @xmath24  and [ @xmath5  between the disc and the boxy bulge at large galactic heights , suggesting that the boxy bulge formed from redistributed disc material .",
    "ngc  1381 , however , shows a clear negative metallicity gradient as a function of @xmath4 , while [ @xmath5 in the bulge at large @xmath4 is significantly enhanced compared to that in the disc .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with a simple disc @xmath30 classical bulge model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for the edge - on s0 ngc  3115 ) .",
    "combined with the marginal cylindrical rotation and the boxy shape of the bulge , this suggests that the centre of ngc  1381 hosts a composite bulge comprised of a classical bulge , a discy pseudobulge and a thick bar .",
    "the naive expectation that we described in our introduction , that a boxy bulge should have the same [ @xmath5  as its host disk if it formed through the bar buckling scenario and is part of a pure disk galaxy , is one part of our argument that ngc  3390 may be a pure disk galaxy .",
    "this picture is complicated by at least two issues .",
    "( 1 ) the disk could have formed rapidly and then buckled promptly , forming an @xmath0-enhanced thick bar , i.e.  a boxy bulge , and ( 2 ) in a system made up of stars in which [ @xmath5  is anticorrelated with [ @xmath24  ( e.g. as seen in young stars in the galaxy , @xcite ) , a negative spatial metallicity gradient would necessarily coincide with a positive spatial [ @xmath5gradient .",
    "regarding point ( 1 ) , we note that the ` wild disc ' scenario ( in which early star formation in the progenitors of disk galaxies takes place on short timescales in massive clumps , e.g. @xcite ) probably can not explain how a bar could be @xmath0-enhanced with respect to its host disc . in dynamical simulations",
    ", these clumps rapidly migrate inward through dynamical friction and combine to form an axisymmetric feature that would probably look like an @xmath0-enhanced classical bulge ( both in terms of populations and dynamics ) .",
    "chemodynamical simulations of bar formation are clearly necessary to clarify the issue .",
    "such studies should also address the more general questions raised by this work .",
    "( 1 ) is the double hump we see in the rotation curve along the major axis of two of the boxy and peanut - shaped bulges definitely associated with a flattened discy pseudobulge ? how far does its influence extend above the plane ? ( 2 ) how does the viewing angle of the bar affect the observed kinematics ?",
    "for example , do we expect weaker cylindrical rotation in peanut - shaped bulges ?",
    "this question was addressed by @xcite , but quantitative ( rather than qualitative ) comparisons to observations are necessary .",
    "( 3 ) do the minor - axis metallicity and age gradients of simulated bars differ systematically from those of classical bulges ? ( 4 ) can simulated bars form in a way that explains the presence of a positive minor - axis [ @xmath5gradient , as seen in ngc  1381 , without the additional presence of a classical bulge ?",
    "the @xmath0-enhanced bulge of ngc  1381 suggests that not all boxy bulges are found in pure disc galaxies ( although some , including the milky way , may be ) .",
    "since the prevalence of giant pure disc galaxies is an acute problem for simulations of galaxy formation in a cosmological context , it is clear that a combined analysis of the stellar dynamics and populations of the central regions of galaxies is an extremely powerful tool .",
    "the sample we have studied in the present work is unusual because it is dominated by boxy and peanut - shaped bulges .",
    "such galaxies are unique laboratories to investigate the nature of the bars that drive secular evolution .",
    "moreover , they raise the possibility that a demographically significant fraction of giant disk galaxies , making up about half the population , is composed of pure disc galaxies . we have shown that a property as simple as the degree of cylindrical rotation varies significantly among boxy / peanut - shaped bulges , as do the properties of their stellar populations .",
    "the driver of this variation is unknown , but may be a property as fundamental as dark halo concentration .",
    "clearly , if we want to further our understanding of the formation of boxy and peanut - shaped bulges , we need data in larger quantities ( to look for correlations with other galaxy properties such as environment and mass distribution ) and at higher @xmath14 ( to more accurately measure stellar population properties ) . two - dimensional data from integral - field units would also be beneficial , allowing the dynamics to be modelled in detail .",
