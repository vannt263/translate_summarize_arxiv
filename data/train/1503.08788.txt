    "two - qubit gates form the basis of quantum computing : any quantum computation can be constructed entirely by these gates , combined with the one - qubit hadamard and phase gates @xcite .",
    "prominent examples are the controlled - phase ( cphase ) gate and the closely related controlled - not ( cnot ) gate , which have been implemented on various physical platforms , such as ion traps @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , photonic qubits @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite and atoms @xcite .",
    "quantum computing , however , depends critically on the accuracy with which these gates are implemented and fault - tolerant computation is possible only if gate infidelity is very low , typically below @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "different sources of error can be identified in an experiment ranging from decoherence to imperfections in the control fields , most notably pulse length errors , field inhomogeneity , improper gate duration , frequency shifts , etc .",
    "because errors in the control fields lead to incorrect rotation angle of the state vector on the bloch sphere , we refer to them as rotation errors .    various techniques to deal with rotation errors",
    "have been proposed and implemented .",
    "composite pulses , for example , have found broad application , where systematic errors in the control field play a major role @xcite . a composite pulse is a sequence of pulses with well - defined phases , which are designed such that the errors from the constituent pulses largely cancel each other .",
    "for example , the very popular broadband composite pulse bb1 of wimperis @xcite cancels the error up to the second order on arbitrary state ( without assumption of the initial state of the system ) .",
    "more accurate pulses have been derived by brown et al . @xcite but they have found limited application as they quickly become extremely long .",
    "low et al .",
    "@xcite found optimal sequences yielding the same accuracy as browns but with much fewer primitive pulses .    in an important development ,",
    "jones @xcite showed how the available single - qubit composite pulses can be used to construct composite conditional two - qubit gates , which are the backbone of quantum computation .",
    "in particular , he extended the bb1 pulse by wimperis to construct a second - order broadband two - qubit gate , which is robust to rotation errors .",
    "later , hill @xcite showed how to achieve robust cnot gates from almost any interaction based on bb1 and used sequence concatenation for higher precision .",
    "gates of higher precision can be obtained even more efficiently by extending low s sequences @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we derive improved highly - accurate composite cphase gates of shorter duration and length than proposed so far .",
    "although derived for two qubits , these sequences can be used to construct robust multiqubit cphase gates as well . in sec .",
    "[ sec : relative ] , we present sequences , which cancel relative errors up to the 6th order using up to 12 gates , and describe how to obtain even higher accuracy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : absolute ] , we design sequences , which can handle errors of both relative and absolute nature .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : ions ] , we describe an implementation of our composite gates with linear laser - driven ion traps .",
    "remarkably , our gates can compensate simultaneous errors in the rabi frequency and in the detuning .",
    "an ideal two - qubit cphase gate , denoted by @xmath1 , is represented by the propagator ( in a rotated basis ) [ ideal ] ( ) = e^i _ x_x , where @xmath2 is the pauli s @xmath3 matrix and @xmath4 is a rotation angle @xcite . when two qubits are coupled with a coupling constant @xmath5 for a time @xmath6 , then @xmath7 .",
    "relative rotation errors are described by multiplying @xmath5 or @xmath6 by an unknown factor , @xmath8 , so that @xmath4 is higher or lower than a desired value @xmath9",
    ". therefore , rather than @xmath10 , in reality one obtains @xmath11 , represented by the propagator @xmath12 .",
    "the sensitivity of the gate to @xmath13 can be much reduced by replacing single rotations with composed rotations , [ def : seq1 ] . here",
    "time is running from right to left , so that the rightmost gate is the first one applied .",
    "this sequence contains @xmath14 cphase gates @xmath15 and @xmath16 single - qubit phase gates @xmath17 , applied to a preselected qubit ; once chosen , the same qubit is used over the entire sequence .",
    "we will apply @xmath17 on qubit 2 .",
    "the sequence is represented by the following propagator [ def : cgate1 ] = ( _ + 1 ) ( _ ) ( _ 0 ) , where ( ) = e^-i _ z.    note that by using the property one can incorporate the phases in the @xmath18-gates , yielding [ def : cgate2 ] = ( _ + 1 ) , or @xmath19 , in a more compact form .",
    "here we have defined a phased cphase gate @xmath20 , represented by the propagator [ phasedgate ] = e^i _ x _ , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the realization may be more convenient in a practical setting , where the operator @xmath24 is achieved at no additional cost by a simple shift of the phase of the driving field , which does not represent a physical modification of the qubit .",
    "we will use the realization for our composite sequences .",
    "the following relations can be derived from the property : _",
    "l = -2_k=0^l-1_k,_+1 = _ k=0^_k , with @xmath25 .",
    "three families of composite sequences are generally considered : broadband , passband and narrowband , the first two of which will be of interest in the present work .",
    "while every gate in the sequence is first - order sensitive to @xmath13 ( all angles @xmath26 are systematically wrong by some constant fraction @xmath13 ) , the phases @xmath27 can be chosen such that the composite gate sequence is robust to @xmath13 up to a certain higher order @xmath28 . to this end",
    ", we nullify the @xmath28 lowest - order propagator derivatives with respect to @xmath13 by solving the following system of @xmath29 algebraic equations for the phases @xmath27 : [ derivativesbb ] .",
    "_ = 0 = 0 , with @xmath30 .",
    "such sequences exhibit robust profiles vs @xmath13 around 0 and are called _",
    "broadband_. we denote them as @xmath31 below .",
    "longer sequences provide more free parameters to vary ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , thereby allowing to eliminate higher orders of @xmath13 .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that we must have @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and also that @xmath34 for all sequences with @xmath35 .",
    "thus we are left with @xmath36 parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 to solve for .",
    "it can be shown that for @xmath37 the angles @xmath26 can take values @xmath38 , where @xmath39 . in what follows",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to @xmath40 or @xmath41 , in order to minimize the total angle and thereby the total time duration of the composite sequence .",
    "it follows from eq .   that @xmath42 is equal to @xmath43 for @xmath44 ( even @xmath45 ) and to @xmath46 for @xmath40 ( odd @xmath45 ) .",
    "thus it can be shown that the product @xmath47 applies @xmath48 to qubit one , where @xmath49 counts the gates with @xmath40 in the product . because the zeroth - order approximation of @xmath31 must reproduce @xmath50 , we must have @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that @xmath49 is even , so that besides the target propagator @xmath50 , the sequence must contain an even number of @xmath53-gates .",
    "hence , the gate sequence acquires the form @xmath54 having length of @xmath14 and a total angle of @xmath55 .",
    "we further found that in our sequences with @xmath56 and @xmath57 we can set @xmath58 .",
    "the important implication from here is that we can merge the first two gates into a single gate @xmath59 .",
    "note that , up to a global phase of @xmath41 , this gate is equivalent to @xmath60 . as a result , we can eliminate one gate @xmath61 from the sequences simply by setting @xmath62 , thereby yielding shorter sequences , [ def : cgate4 ] , , with length @xmath63 and a total angle of @xmath64 .",
    "we have subtracted 1 from each index for consistence of notation .    with the above assumptions the left - hand side of eq .",
    "can be handled relatively easy by applying the identities , and , shown in appendices [ appendix : identities ] and [ appendix : derivatives ] . for @xmath65 ,",
    "we obtain [ order0 ] _ k=0^(-1)^k-_k + _ + 1 = 0 .",
    "higher - order terms are not simple enough to be useful .",
    "let us consider a sequence with @xmath67 . following the above arguments , we set @xmath68 . zero- and",
    "first - order errors are cancelled by imposing the following set of equations : [ sys ] @xmath69 we obtain @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , and the sequence is = .",
    "we consider this sequence to be of significant interest from experimental viewpoint for its reasonable robustness and small duration and length .",

    "the following sequence is obtained = with @xmath76 .",
    "the length is reduced to four gates as two adjacent phases are found to be equal .",
    "this sequence coincides with the bb1 pulse derived by wimperis @xcite and later used by jones @xcite to construct a robust two - qubit gate , as discussed in the introduction .",

    "note that @xmath91 with total angle @xmath92 performs almost as good as ap3 and pd4 with respective total angles @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "in addition to the above sequences , which compensate relative errors in the target rotation angle @xmath9 , we have designed composite sequences , which suppress absolute errors that occur as a constant offset @xmath96 in the rotation angles , @xmath97 , represented by @xmath98 . like relative errors @xmath13",

    "indeed , we have @xmath101 potential errors in the phase @xmath102 can be removed following the composite technique of ref .",
    "@xcite .    finally , we construct composite gates robust to errors of either nature , relative and absolute .",
    "this is done by substituting @xmath24 with @xmath103 throughout in our sequences in sec .",

    "we discuss a physical realization of our composite cphase gate with laser - driven linear ion traps . while we consider ion traps , we note that our sequences are applicable to other systems , as well .",
    "in trapped ions a popular two - qubit gate is the srensen - mlmer ( sm ) gate @xcite .",
    "it has been used by numerous ion trapping groups as a paradigmatic gate for quantum information processing .",

    "@xcite and later by kirchmair et al .",
    "@xcite with fidelities around 97%",
    ". a record gate fidelity of 99.3% has been achieved by benhelm et al .",
    "various dynamical decoupling techniques have been experimentally demonstrated to protect the two - qubit gate from the environment @xcite .",
    "coherent error suppression using a pulse shaping technique has also been experimentally demonstrated @xcite , where the effects of certain frequency and timing errors were suppressed .    in this section",
    "we will show how one can achieve a composite cphase gate , robust to i ) rotation errors , which may be caused by improper laser intensity and timing , and ii ) certain frequency errors , which may be caused by a shift in the trapping frequency .",
    "the gate duration grows only linearly with the achieved precision contrary to previous proposals for coherent error suppression @xcite , where exponential scaling is observed .",
    "consider two ions irradiated along the transverse @xmath3 direction with a bichromatic laser field with frequencies @xmath104 and @xmath105 , tuned close to the first red ( @xmath106 ) and blue ( @xmath107 ) sidebands of a common vibrational mode . here",
    "@xmath108 is the frequency of the internal atomic transition of each ion , @xmath109 is the frequency of the vibrational mode , and @xmath110 is a suitably chosen detuning .",
    "the laser frequencies @xmath111 and @xmath112 sum up to twice the qubit transition frequency , while neither of the lasers is resonant to any level . thereby only transitions where the atomic states are changed collectively take place .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is [ ham ] h = g_k=1 ^ 2(_k^+ ) ( e^it - i_k^- + a e^-it + i_k^- ) , where @xmath113 is the ( time - independent ) rabi frequency of the spin - phonon coupling and @xmath114 , with @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) being the spin raising ( lowering ) operator for ion @xmath117 .",
    "the spin and the motional laser phases are defined by @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are , respectively , the laser phases of the blue- and red - detuned laser beams as seen by ion @xmath117 .",
    "the propagator @xmath121 is obtained using the magnus expansion @xcite : u = d ( ) , where @xmath6 denotes the duration of interaction .",
    "@xmath122 is a displacement operator , @xmath123 with [ disp ] = -(e^it-1)_k=1 ^ 2 ( _ k^+ ) e^-i_k^- , which causes an undesired change of the vibrational state of the ion system .",
    "now we discuss how to restore the vibrational state ( eliminate @xmath122 from the propagator @xmath121 ) , while preserving the conditional dynamics , described by the @xmath124-@xmath124 term in @xmath121 .",
    "note that if we only shift @xmath125 with @xmath41 in eq .",
    ", we get a displacement of opposite magnitude , @xmath126",
    ". this phase shift can be achieved either by a direct manipulation of the laser phase or by sandwiching @xmath121 with @xmath41 pulses on both ions .",
    "therefore , in order to restore the vibrational state , we apply a second bichromatic pulse of equal rabi frequency @xmath113 and duration @xmath6 with a phase @xmath125 shifted with @xmath41 .",
    "then the propagator becomes [ finalpropagator ] u = , provided that potential errors in the interaction variables are systematic .",

    "the first allows us to use global addressing , a key advantage in the srensen - mlmer gate @xcite , at the expense of additional single - qubit phase gates , while the second requires individual addressing and possibly just a single phase gate ( for @xmath67 ) .",
    "global addressing implies equal laser phases for both ions , i.e. @xmath127 . without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath128 , which implies that @xmath129 .",
    "the propagator becomes u = , which yields the gate @xmath130 ( cf .",
