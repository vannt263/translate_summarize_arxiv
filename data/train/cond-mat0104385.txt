    "we study a two - dimensional heisenberg model with additional frustrating interactions of strength @xmath4 on every second diagonal bond ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) given by the hamiltonian    @xmath5    where @xmath6 denotes a spin operator for spin @xmath0 at site i. the model , commonly referred to as the shastry ",
    "sutherland model @xcite , displays a rich zero - temperature phase diagram as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath7 , showing long range ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic and helical order , as well as short range spin liquid behaviour .",
    "also for large frustrating coupling @xmath4 the model has an exactly known ground state , built up of uncoupled dimers on the diagonal bonds .",
    "it was the existence of this exact ground state , which has first attracted attention to the model .",
    "recently the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) for @xmath8 has been widely discussed , because it represents essential features of srcu@xmath9(bo@xmath10)@xmath9 , a newly discovered spin gap substance @xcite .",
    "srcu@xmath9(bo@xmath10)@xmath9 appears to have a ground state of dimer singlets and some of its unusual magnetic properties are well explained by the shastry ",
    "sutherland hamiltonian .    in the classical limit ( @xmath11 ) of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) the nature of the ground state phases and their boundaries",
    "are easily analyzed ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the model shows two long range helical phases for @xmath12 , which are separated by an antiferromagnetic dimer phase along the line @xmath13 . in the regime @xmath14 the ground state is ordered antiferromagnetically for @xmath15 and ferromagnetically for @xmath16 . for @xmath17",
    "a phase of independent ferromagnetic dimers occurs",
    ".    the ground state energy of the helical phase can be found by minimizing the energy of a cluster of only three spins . from this basic three spin entity",
    "the ground state of the whole system is constructed .",
    "depending on the initial choice of spin directions one finds a spin helix with a four - fold degenerate direction and with a twist angle of @xmath18 between neighbouring spins@xcite .    2.0 cm    away from the classical limit quantum effects transmute the classical antiferromagnetic dimers for @xmath19 into unique singlet dimers and stabilize the resulting dimer phase . in what follows we will often use the variable @xmath20 , which is the inverse of the frustration . for @xmath21 and @xmath15",
    "the dimer phase occupies a finite region of the phase diagram and at a certain critical value @xmath22 there is a phase transition of first order @xcite to a new phase , whose nature is controversially discussed at the moment . for even larger @xmath23",
    "the system changes to the antiferromagnetic regime .    in the ferromagnetic region ( @xmath16 )",
    "the situation is slightly simpler , since for @xmath8 there is a first order phase transition directly from the dimer to the ferromagnetic phase at @xmath24 .",
    "this transition marks one of the exactly known points in the phase diagram . for  @xmath25 ,",
    "like in the antiferromagnetic regime , the system crosses at a negative @xmath26 from the dimer to an intervening phase .",
    "finally at @xmath24 the ferromagnetic region is reached for all @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath27 the classical phase diagram is not changed by quantum effects .",
    "the ferromagnetic dimer phase for @xmath28 becomes a phase of independent spin-@xmath29 dimers with macroscopic degeneracy .",
    "it may be interesting to note , that the spin-@xmath0 square lattice antiferromagnet for @xmath30 is continuously connected to the spin-@xmath29 square lattice antiferromagnet as @xmath31 .",
    "there are two major problems connected with the phase transition between the short range spin liquid phase and the adjacent phases .",
    "firstly the nature of the phases adjacent to the singlet dimer phase - both on the ferromagnetic and on the antiferromagnetic side - is not clear and a point of intense investigation at the moment .",
    "secondly for arbitrary @xmath0 the boundary of the dimer phase can not be determined by a simple argument like in the case @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the second problem and give rigorous lower ( sec .  [ low ] ) and upper ( sec .  [ up ] ) bounds on the phase boundaries of the dimer phase by using various versions of a variational ansatz for finite clusters .",
    "various approximative methods have been used recently to determine this phase boundary . in ref.@xcite",
    "the phase boundary was calculated by means of schwinger boson mean - field theory . by the flow equation method in ref.@xcite",
    "a value of @xmath32 was obtained and in ref.@xcite an intervening plaquette phase was suggested for @xmath8 occupying the regime @xmath33 . in ref.@xcite by an extension of @xmath34 to the symplectic groups @xmath35 an intervening phase with helical and incommensurate order was found between a dimer phase and a region with collinear commensurate order .",
    "also in ref.@xcite it was found for a two - dimensional model with frustration , that the dimer and the antiferromagnetic phase are separated by an intervening regime , which is characterized as a weakly incommensurate spin density wave .",
    "to obtain lower bounds on @xmath38 we decompose the hamiltonian @xmath39 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamilton ] ) into cluster terms @xmath40 with @xmath41 and calculate the lowest eigenvalues @xmath42 of the hamiltonian @xmath40 of the clusters ( n is the number of spins in the cluster ) .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath39 is chosen in such a way , that the clusters cover the whole lattice without overlapping bonds .",
    "taking the ground state of h as variational state for the finite clusters @xcite it follows that @xmath42 is always smaller than or equal to the ground state energy @xmath43 of @xmath39 . to obtain a bound on @xmath38 we choose finite clusters",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) which have the dimer state as an eigenstate and calculate their critical value @xmath44 .",
    "it is obvious , that @xmath44 is always smaller than the @xmath38 of the infinite system .",
    "as the simplest possible system we consider a plaquette with four spins ( first entry in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in this case",
    "the energy of the second lowest state , which for growing x is competing with the dimer state , crosses the energy of the dimer ground state at    @xmath45    from what was said above @xmath46 is a strict lower bound for @xmath38 .",
    "( note that for @xmath47 the first estimate eq .",
    "( [ eq : low_4 ] ) is better than the bound @xmath48 given in ref.@xcite . )",
    "better limits on @xmath38 were obtained by calculating the ground state energies of the systems shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] using the lanczos method .    for a system with 31 sites",
    "we thus obtain a best lower bound of 0.5914 for @xmath49 .",
    "we want to point out , that even for @xmath8 , where systems of up to 31 spins were calculated , it is difficult to make a good finite size analysis with the results of the finite clusters , because not only the system size , but also the shape of the cluster influences the ground state energy . on these grounds",
    "the significance of the recent estimate of @xmath50 in ref.@xcite , which was obtained by an extrapolation of three systems with _ different shapes _ , appears questionable .    to show the tendency of a possible extrapolation we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the results for @xmath51 for @xmath8 as a function of @xmath52 and connect by a straight line the results of systems with @xmath53 spins which have corresponding shapes .",
    "the point @xmath54 , where this line meets the ordinate shows a reasonable value for @xmath51 , but obviously can not be taken as a serious extrapolation .",
    "the best bounds we obtained for @xmath55 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "let us now consider the ferromagnetic regime .",
    "we find , that the dimer state of a four spin plaquette is the ground state for @xmath56 which implies    @xmath57    this bound is exact for @xmath8 , since @xmath58 coincides with the boundary of the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "for @xmath59 we again find an improvement on the result of the four spin system by considering larger clusters .",
    "some results for @xmath55 are shown in fig .",
    "upper bounds for the stability of the dimer phase can be obtained by considering a variational ansatz for finite clusters .",
    "we only briefly sketch the idea here , since it is widely used in the literature ( see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is split into clusters without common spins and external bonds connecting the clusters , @xmath60 as indicated for four site clusters in fig .",
    "we use as variational state @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the ground state of @xmath63 .",
    "if the total spin of the clusters is zero in the ground state the expectation value of the external bonds vanishes    @xmath64    we have calculated the ground state energies @xmath65 of @xmath63 for clusters with up to n=32 spins and obtained upper bounds on @xmath38 by comparing them with the energy of the dimer state .    for a four spin plaquette and arbitrary spin @xmath0",
    "we thus find @xmath66 for stripe configurations of the type @xmath67 the resulting @xmath38 for @xmath8 are shown as a function of one over system size in fig .",
    "note that results for two different types of stripes ( as indicated in the figure ) are given and that both types extrapolate to almost the same point 0.7126(1 ) for @xmath68 . a similar extrapolation for stripes of width four ( see .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) gives an upper bound of @xmath69 for @xmath8 , which is better than the bound obtained for stripes of width two .",
    "again three different shapes converge to about the same result as n approaches infinity .",
    "the lowest value in fig .  [ fig6 ] was obtained for a @xmath70 system yielding the exact bound @xmath71 .",
    "an extrapolation of stripes of width two for s=1 and systems of up to 16 spins gives a best upper bound of @xmath72 .    in the limit @xmath73",
    "the upper bound ( [ eq : upper1 ] ) derived from the four spin system does not provide the correct behaviour expected for the classical heisenberg model .",
    "we can however find another bound , which yields a better upper limit for @xmath74 by using a helical product state as a variational state .",
    "the ground state energy for @xmath11 in the helical phase @xcite is given by    @xmath75    where the angle between two neighbouring spins is @xmath18 and the length of the spins is normalized to 1 .",
    "we consider as variational ansatz a system of ( quantum ) spins polarized along the directions of the classical spins . comparing the expectation value of this state with the energy of the dimer state we find    @xmath76    from which @xmath77 results as a criterion for the instability of the dimer state .",
    "thus for @xmath78 the dimer state is no longer the lowest state , because the helical product state has a lower energy . since the ground state energy of the helical state does not depend on the sign of @xmath7 eq",
    "( [ eq : hel_bound ] ) also gives an upper bound on @xmath79 in the ferromagnetic regime .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the phase diagram of the shastry  sutherland model for arbitrary spin @xmath0 . in the regime",
    "@xmath80 the phase diagram for the quantum models ( @xmath21 ) fully agrees with that of the classical model ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "quantum effects do , however , modify the classical phase diagram in the regime @xmath12 . as emphasized already by shastry and sutherland @xcite",
    "the dimer phase is strongly stabilized by quantum effects and exists in a regime @xmath81 which grows with decreasing spin s. the nature of the intervening phases originating from the classical helical phases is not totally clear , but their regime shrinks as the dimer phase expands . for @xmath16",
    "the intervening phase between the dimer and the ferromagnetic phase is certain to exist for @xmath47 , but completely disappears for @xmath82 . for @xmath15 exact statements on the existence of an intervening phase between the dimer and the nel phase",
    "are not available , but in ref.@xcite rather strong evidence in favor of its existence for @xmath82 is provided .",
    "2.2 cm    1.5 cm    the emphasis of the present work was put on the derivation of exact upper and lower bounds on the boundaries @xmath83 and @xmath84 of the dimer phase .",
    "our results on this topic are summarized in fig .",
    "the dark grey area shows the region where the dimer state is certain to be the ground state and the white area is the region where the dimer state is certainly not the ground state . from the results presented in this paper it follows , that the exact boundary must be located in the light grey area .",
    "the black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] represent curves discussed in the text .",
    "the upper bounds for @xmath85 were obtained by a helical variational ansatz ( @xmath86 ) , by a finite cluster ansatz ( @xmath87 ) and for @xmath88 by extrapolating results for series of finite clusters ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the lower bounds on @xmath85 were derived from four spin plaquettes ( @xmath89 ) and from the finite systems shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath90 . in the ferromagnetic regime",
    "we have a lower bound ( @xmath91 ) from the helical ansatz , which is shown together with the upper bounds obtained from the largest tractable finite clusters ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the intervening phase on the ferromagnetic side extends down to @xmath24 ( bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) where the ferromagnetic regime begins for all @xmath0 .",
