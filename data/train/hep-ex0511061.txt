    "the @xmath1 charmonium and @xmath2 bottomonium states have several advantages over light quark ( @xmath3 ) hadrons .",
    "the relativistic effects are much smaller , the strong coupling constant @xmath4 is small enough to permit use of perturbative methods to a large extent , and the spectra consist of clearly separated narrow states .",
    "this is illustrated in fig . 1 for charmonium .    over the last three years",
    "there has been a renaissance in heavy ",
    "quark spectroscopy with genuine discoveries , important precision measurements , and a host of surprises .",
    "these are the subject of this talk , but i also refer you to other related talks presented elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the central @xmath5 interaction is well represented by the so  called cornell potential ( or its variants ) as the sum of a one  gluon exchange coulombic potential proportional to @xmath6 and a not ",
    "well  understood confinement potential , generally taken as lorentz scalar and proportional to @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . far less is known about the spin dependence of the @xmath5 potential which is responsible for the spin  orbit and spin  spin splittings of the @xmath5 states .",
    "the crucial determinant of the spin dependent @xmath5 interaction is the hyperfine spin ",
    "singlet / spin  triplet splitting of the states . unfortunately ,",
    "despite numerous and valiant efforts , no spin  singlet states have ever been successfully identified in bottomonium , and we have to depend exclusively on charmonium . in charmonium the singlet @xmath8state @xmath9 and the triplet @xmath8state @xmath10 have been known for a long time , with the hyperfine splitting , @xmath11 mev .",
    "the other two bound singlet states @xmath12 , or @xmath13 , and @xmath14 have long eluded successful identification .",
    "well , now they have been finally discovered .",

    "2 , the @xmath8-wave radial excitations , @xmath18 and @xmath12 sample the confinement potential almost exclusively . as a result",
    ", they provide our only insight into how the hyperfine interaction varies in going from @xmath15 states ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , with an almost 5050 exposure to coulombic and confinement potentials , to @xmath16 states ( @xmath12 and @xmath18 ) , which lie in the confinement potential territory .",
    "the mass of @xmath18 is extremely well known , @xmath21 mev , but @xmath22 was unknown .",
    "none of the earlier attempts to identify @xmath12 , which included crystal ball @xcite , fermilab e760/e835 @xcite , delphi @xcite , l3 @xcite , and cleo @xcite were successful .",
    "the breakthrough came from an unexpected source , belle @xcite .",
    "since then several experiments have confirmed the identification of @xmath12 , and their results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "3 shows the results of cleo @xcite and babar @xcite for the reaction @xmath23 .",
    "while it is clear that @xmath12 has been successfully identified , its mass still has substantial uncertainty , and its width remains unmeasured . using the world average @xmath24 mev , we get @xmath25 , which means @xmath26 .",
    "although a potential model calculation can always be found with just about any result , it is a fact that most predictions were that @xmath27 .",
    "so , here we have a result for theory to digest . on the experimental side",
    "we have still much work to do , the first being to find the width of @xmath12 .",
    "together with @xmath28 , it will shed light on whether we are observing effects related to the confinement interaction or configuration mixing .     in the reaction @xmath23 by cleo ( left ) and babar ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   in the reaction @xmath23 by cleo ( left ) and babar ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    .summary of @xmath12 observations .

    "now comes babar .",
    "they have analyzed isr events from 211 fb@xmath29 of data @xcite , and report a convincing ( significance @xmath30 ) , broad enhancement in the invariant mass @xmath31 spectrum ( fig .",
