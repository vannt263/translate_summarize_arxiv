    "the semileptonic decay of hadrons containing @xmath6 quarks allows one to measure the @xmath7 and @xmath8 elements of the quark mixing matrix .",
    "reliable model independent values for these matrix elements can only be obtained if one can accurately calculate the hadronic decay distributions ( or decay rates ) from qcd .",
    "two approaches to semileptonic @xmath9 decay are to study exclusive decay modes such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , or @xmath12 , or inclusive decay modes such as @xmath13 .",
    "the inclusive and exclusive modes have been analyzed using heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite .",
    "the exclusive decay rates can be obtained by computing decay form factors using hqet , and then integrating over the allowed phase space .",
    "the final answer typically depends on the hadron masses , and on hadron matrix elements of various quark and gluon operators .",
    "the inclusive decay rate can be obtained using an operator product expansion ( ope ) to write the square of the decay amplitude as an expansion in a series of local operators .",
    "the matrix elements of this series between hadron states then gives the decay rate as an expansion in @xmath14 .",
    "the wilson coefficients are functions of kinematic variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the ope can be justified for values of @xmath16 which are far from the physical region ; the utility of the expansion comes from relating a contour integral in the unphysical region of the complex @xmath17 plane to an integral over the physical region  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the contour integral always has a segment close to the physical region , where the ope may not be valid .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected that the ope computation of the differential distributions ( including non - perturbative corrections ) is valid , provided the results are smeared over an energy of order @xmath2 .",
    "the idea that the parton calculation agrees with the full qcd answer for _ smeared _ inclusive distributions is known as local duality .",
    "it is important to test the assumptions used in the ope based calculation of inclusive decay rates .",
    "one way to do this is to compare the inclusive decay rate to the exclusive decay rate summed over all allowed channels ; they must be equal by definition .",
    "this equality will arise nontrivially , because the ope gives the inclusive rate in terms of quark masses , rather than hadron masses .",
    "higher dimension operators in the ope must enter in precisely the correct way to compensate for the mismatch . a demonstration that this occurs alleviates many of the concerns about the validity of local duality in qcd .    in this paper , we demonstrate by explicit computation that the inclusive decay rates computed by an ope or by summing over exclusive rates are equal for hadrons containing a heavy quark in the shifman - voloshin ( sv ) limit  @xcite @xmath18 .",
