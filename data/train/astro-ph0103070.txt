    "the well  known galactic binary star ss433 shows unique relativistic jets moving with a velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the jets are originated in the supercritical accretion disk .",
    "the disk is extremely bright , its total luminosity is @xmath4  erg / s with maximum of the radiation in uv ( dolan et al .",
    "we observe a supercritical wind outflowing from the disk , the temperature of the wind photosphere is @xmath5  k. the disk orientation is `` edge  on '' and variable ( @xmath6 ) because of the precession .",
    "the jets propagating in inner regions of the wind make channels , which may form a collimated radiation of ss433 .",
    "the jets are accelerated and collimated in some inner region inside the photosphere .",
    "they are accelerated by radiative pressure with the line  locking , where the collimated radiation is also needed ( shapiro , milgrom , rees  1986 ) .",
    "necessity of ss433 collimated radiation follows also from observation data ( fabrika  1997 ) .",
    "the outflowing wind velocity is @xmath7  km / s , the total mass loss rate in the wind is @xmath8 , the mass loss rate in the jets is @xmath9 .",
    "the wind photosphere size is @xmath10  cm and corresponding photospheric temperature is @xmath5  k , what agree well with direct estimates from ss433 fluxes .",
    "the photospheric size inside the cannels @xmath11  cm and corresponding temperature of inner photosphere is @xmath12  k , where @xmath13 is opening angle of the channels .",
    "the wind photosphere mean size @xmath14 is much greater than that of around the jets @xmath15 , what means that channels and collimated radiation do exist . from ss433 data we can only find upper limit on the opening angle of the photocone @xmath16 .",
    "the supercritical accretion disk simulations ( eggum , coroniti , katz,1985 ) show that in the inner regions of accretion disk a cone is formed in outflowing matter , where the collimated radiation and fast  moving gas propagate .",
    "these cones are rather broad , @xmath17 . in active galactic nuclei ( agns )",
    "ionization cones are observed , which are very probably photocones of collimated radiation .",
    "they are broad with opening angles in the range @xmath18 ( wilson , tsvetanov  1994 ) .",
    "ss433 star being orientated `` face  on '' and observed in photocone will look brighter by the geometrical brightening factor @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is solid angle of the channel",

    "ii is not easy to estimate @xmath22 .",
    "we may expect @xmath28 and accept here @xmath29 .",
    "how many such stars one may expect ?",
    "we know one ss433 in the galaxy as a persistent superaccretor and a source of relativistic jets .",
    "results of relativistic binary stars population synthesis ( lipunov et al .",
    "1996 ) show that we may expect ( @xmath30 ) ss433s per a galaxy like milky way . very important , that it is much more propable to find such a star in young star ",
    "burst regions , i.  e. rather in nuclear regions in galaxies .",
    "let us accept one ss433 star per spiral galaxy like mw , and taking into account the specific orientation of `` face  on ss433 '' , we accept a frequency of the face  on ss433s as @xmath31 per spiral galaxy .",
    "so we have _ an assumption _ which is not easy to be corrected today   the cone luminosity is @xmath32  erg / s .",
    "we do not specify opening angle @xmath13 ( t.  e. the brightening factor @xmath33 ) of the photocone .",
    "in fig.1 we show these simple relations , how expected x  ray luminosity ( @xmath34 ) and number of mw  like galaxies per one face  on ss433 star ( @xmath31 ) depend on @xmath13 .",
    "we search for * hypothetical * objects , face  on ss433 stars , which have to be ultraluminous x  ray sources .",
    "their expected properties are : + * frequency*. @xmath31 per spiral galaxy like mw .",
    "th expected scatter is @xmath35  one order of magnitude . + * location*. spiral galaxies : arms , star ",
    "burst regions , irr galaxies .",
    "nuclear regions of spiral and s0 galaxies : the conditions needed for production of such stars are practically the same as those for production of an agn . + * luminosity and spectrum*. _ x - rays _ : luminosity is ultra  bright , @xmath36  erg / s .",
    "it depends on many unknown parameters : the cone luminosity and opening angle , specific orientation and precession phase at observations .",
    "spectrum is unknown , probably soft . very variable ,",
    "sporadical variability from 1  min to 1 year , periodical variavility with orbibal and precession periods ( days , months ) .",
    "the fast variability is the main criterion for such objects",
    ". it could be quasi ",
    "periodical with a time  scale of about @xmath37 , what is about 200  sec for ss433 .",
    "+ _ visible range _ : very faint ( fabrika , sholukhova 1995 ) , @xmath38 for @xmath39  mpc .",
    "the main contributor is the accretion disk wind , the object appears as uv or blue star .",
    "+ _ radio _ : the ss433 being face  on and observed at @xmath39  mpc ( with taking into account relativistic beaming , @xmath40 ) will show a radio flux @xmath41  mjy .",
    "the transient source cygx3 ( accepting the same beaming @xmath42 ) will be observed as @xmath43  mjy source in maximum . the transient source grs1915 + 105 ( the beaming factor at @xmath44 ) will show maximum flux of about @xmath45  mjy . at the modern sensitivity of radio surveys , like the first survey we have a little hope to detect such sources .",
    "we have correlated rc3 catalogue of galaxies ( de vaucouleurs et al .",

    "we have found that the rerr@xmath4730and chosen rerr  =  30for final correlations .",
    "we see that about 400420 positive correlations do exist , but about 90 sources from them are contaminations ( fig.2 ) . to select agns among our positive correlations we used veron ",
    "cetty , veron  ( 2000 ) cataloque choosing only confirmed from optical spectroscopy seyfert and liner nuclei . as a first step we study in this paper only point  like sources from rosat ass and only spiral and irregular galaxies from rc3 cataloque .",
    "we have found 418 positive correlations of rosat ass point  like sources   308 sources from fsc and 110 sources from bsc . after comparing with veron  cetty ,",
    "veron  ( 2000 ) cataloque we have 327 positive correlations of x  ray sources ( unknown as agns ) with rc3 galaxies .",
    "considering only spiral and irregular galaxies , we find the final number of x  ray sources is 142 .",

    "only 10@xmath52 of our sources were detected in fsc below @xmath53 . in bsc only 6@xmath52 of our positive correlations",
    "were detected below @xmath54 .",
    "a visual inspection of all 142 bsc+fsc sources in spiral and irregular galaxies has been done .",
    "these sources have been classified in 4 groups : + 1st class of clear offset ( non  nuclear ) sources , without probable contamination with a star ",
    "like object in x  ray error boxes   37 sources ; + 2nd class of probable offset , but may be nuclear sources   43 sources ; + 3rd class of very probable nuclear sources , unknown agns can be present in this class ,   35 sources ; + 4th class of probable contaminations ( star  like objects inside a box , or unusually big distance between x  ray source and galaxy .",
    "fig.4 presents x  ray hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 for known agns among our sources ( from bsc only ) and for our sources from bsc+fsc .",
    "there are many x  ray sources with hard spectra among our best correlations .",
    "the known x ",
    "ray binaries in rosat data show very hard spectra ( motch et at . , 1998 ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with interpertation of the sources as x  ray binaries .",
    "fig.5 shows the hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 versus x  ray luminosity for 3 our classes of sources .",
    "the only firm conclusion may be done here , that nuclear sources are brighter .",
    "they include really unknowm agns .",
    "in fig.6 we present distributions of x  ray luminosities of our sources ( a , b , c ) and galactic sources from read , pomnan and strickland  ( 1996 ) ( d ) , offset sources ( e ) and agns ( f ) from roberts , warwick  ( 2000 ) .",
    "the last is a study of complete list of nearby galaxies with the hri of rosat .",
    "one can see again that our 2dn and 3rd classes do include new agns .",
    "we may compare our results with results by roberts and warwick  ( 2000 ) .",
    "using only spiral galaxies in both samples , taking their sources found with our `` limiting flux '' @xmath55  erg / s and taking our sources found in their `` limiting galaxy magnitude '' @xmath56 range of galaxies , we find that they found x  ray sources in 39  @xmath52 of galaxies , but we found sources in only @xmath57 of galaxies .",
    "this contradiction may be because of observational selection , roberts and warwick  ( 2000 ) used hri data of pointing observations , but we used ass data , which were obtained without any preference of astronomers . from the other hand a ratio of offset sources to agns found from their flux ",
    "limited data is 1.3 , and the same ratio ( we have not 3rd class sources in our bright  galaxies sample , all they are known agns ! ) in our data 1.5 , if we consider the 1st + 2-nd class sources as non  nuclear over known agns .",
    "and this ratio is 0.7 , if we consider only 1st class sources as non  agns over 2nd class sources + known agns .",
    "we conclude that our number of offset / nuclear sources ( @xmath58 ) is in agreement with the number obtainesd from roberts and warwick  ( 2000 ) data ( 1.3 ) .",
    "fig.7 shows x  ray luminosities versus galactic distances for our three classes of positive correlations .",
    "we see that the fsc may detect all sources with @xmath59  erg / s in galaxies closer that 4  mpc , and all sources with luminosities @xmath60  erg / s could be detected to a distance @xmath61  mpc .",
    "we calculated frequencies of the positive correlations in the galaxies studied , that is a number of sources in s and irr galaxies over all galaxies of these types in the rc3 cataloque closer than some specific distance .",
    "in fig.8 we observe a high peak in the 1st class sources at distances @xmath62  mpc .",
    "sources with luminosities @xmath63  erg / s contribute mainly in the peak . otherwise at distances",
    "@xmath64  mpc we have a strong selection in our data and can not recognize all sources with @xmath60  erg / s",
    ". we may estimate a frequency using only closer galaxies , in the interval of distances @xmath65  mpc .",
    "the frequency of the best offset sources ( the 1-st class ) is about @xmath2 per s / irr galaxy in this interval .",
    "they are ultra  bright x  ray sources , @xmath66  erg / s .",
    "frequencies of sources of the 2-nd and 3-rd classes show quite different behaviour .",
    "they confirm the interpretation , that in 2-nd class of  probably offset ",
    "sources we have both stellar sources and agns , but among the 3-rd class ( the known agns being excluded ) we have unknown agns .",
    "we conclude that the data do not contradict the idea of existence of the `` hypothetical '' face  on ss433 x  ray sources . the only way to identify such stars is their expected violent variability .",
    "the problem of existence of ultrabright x  ray sources in galaxies is well known ( fabbiano , 1998 ; roberts and warwick , 2000 ) .",
    "we may identify these sources , on the base of today  level of knowledges , as face  on ss433 stars ."
