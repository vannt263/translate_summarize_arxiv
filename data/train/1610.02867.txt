    "understanding the motion of a charged particle motion in a complex magnetic field is one of the key ingredients of magnetically confined fusion plasmas @xcite and it has been a long standing issue in plasmas physics .",
    "@xcite in this paper we focus our attention on the case of so called chaotic ( also called stochastic ) magnetic field lines , which typically occurs when due to a perturbation a magnetic surface breaks down .",
    "@xcite indeed if the perturbation consists of several modes , such that the created islands are overlapping , a global chaotic ( stochastic ) region can be expected in the magnetic field.@xcite our study follows our recent study of full particle motion in magnetic fields that can give rise to so - called internal transport barriers ( itb).@xcite an itb can be created between two chaotic regions by a non - monotonic@xcite or a plateau@xcite profiles of the safety factor @xmath2 , which induce reversed or low magnetic shears respectively . in this perspective , the itb emerges as a region foliated by invariant magnetic tori and acts as an effective barrier for particle transport that confines particles when we assume that particles move along magnetic field lines .",
    "however , there exist several cases for which the topological structure of particle orbits is completely different from the magnetic one .",
    "these structure can change as well drastically by simply modifying the initial pitch angle or energy.@xcite in fact it has been shown that when the energy is sufficiently large the effective location of the resonance which was destroying the magnetic structure can be displaced and even disappear as we shall discuss later on.@xcite to be more specific , when we consider only particles with small energy whose motion is mostly one along a magnetic field line and some gyration around it .",
    "then , the qualitative structure ( _ e.g. _ place of the resonance point on which the winding number of orbit is rational ) is similar to the one of magnetic field lines , so that the magnetic itbs @xcite act as the barrier for particles .",
    "meanwhile , for energetic particles , it was found by computing full particle orbits numerically that these structures are quite different from the magnetic ones .",
    "@xcite it is for instance possible that for a given class of particles with a range of energies and pitch angles , an itb appears in the chaotic region of the magnetic field lines.@xcite conversely it is also possible that the magnetic itb is essentially useless from the particles point of view.@xcite    in this article , we focus on the creation of an effective itb in the particle orbits , and we try to monitor them by checking the resonance shift and its potential disappearance . at the same time , we aim to shed some light on the numerical results discussed in ref . , using a more systematic theoretically predictive approach , which in some cases is not only qualitative , but also quantitative .",

    "this effective profile is computed numerically , but also theoretical expressions are obtained , one from the full particle orbits in the integrable case , and the other from the guiding center orbits approximation .",

    "[ fig:125e-2 ] when the pitch angle is large ( @xmath115 rad ) , we notice that as energy is increased , the graph of @xmath78 moves to left , so that , the resonance points shift to left , that is , @xmath3-position of the resonances decreases .",
    "this is also consistent with the result exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : particle - orbits]-(b ) .",
    "we can notice as well that the resonance that is closer to the center of the cylinder shifts more than the one on the periphery , so that the distance between resonances gets larger .",
    "this is also consistent with the numerical results,@xcite the itb gets to be wider as energy increases .",
    "to conclude our study , we have shown in this paper that using an effective @xmath0-profile computed from trajectories in the unperturbed magnetic field and reasoning afterwards in the more intuitive field line setting of a modified magnetic field was able to predict the creation or the behavior of itbs .",
    "in fact , we could show that the winding number modifications induced by energy and pitch angle changes created a resonance shift or disappearance in the particle orbit , which brings about suppression of the magnetic perturbation effect in the particle motion , the creation of an itb in the chaotic region of the magnetic field lines .",
    "these results were numerically found but left theoretically unexplained in a previous work.@xcite in the current paper these results are confirmed using this effective profile with first numerics based on the full particle orbits and as well a theory based on the guiding center velocity of alfvn or using the integrable nature of trajectories in the unperturbed situations .",
    "we exhibit two kinds of scenarios for the creation of an itb for the particles creation in the chaotic magnetic field lines .",
    "the first one is due to the resonance disappearance due to the curvature drift effect for the energetic particles with small pitch angle , and the second one is the resonance shift brought about by the grad @xmath1 drift effect for the energetic particles with large pitch angle . in this last case , there are two resonances for which @xmath163 because of the shape of @xmath0-profiles .",
    "although both of them shift in the same direction , resonances move towards the inside region of the cylinder , the distance between the two resonances gets wider , leaving enough room for an itb to appear in the chaotic field lines .    in this paper , we have focused our study in cases when high energy brings about the creation of an itb in a region where the magnetic itb does not exist .",
    "we also would like to point out that our present results indicates that the destruction of the itb for the energetic particles is also possible .",
    "indeed let us assume that the magnetic field has an itb between two resonances where @xmath52 .",
    "when the pitch angle is small and there exists only curvature drift effect , as energy increases , the two resonances initially are getting closer to each other until they collide and disappear ( bifurcation ) then , it is very likely that the itb gets destroyed in this region . on the other hand ,",
    "if when grad @xmath1 drift exists , unlike our case , if the resonance shift towards the inner part of the cylinder ( @xmath154 ) is smaller than the one in outer side ( @xmath153 ) , the resonances are getting also closer to each other as energy is increased and in the same spirit the itb can be destroyed , with particles showing global chaos in region where the magnetic itb is present .",
    "although we use a model of magnetized plasmas with specific @xmath0-profile , the present result is applicable to more general situations .",
    "this is because both the particle orbit and drift velocity are determined by local information of the particle and field .",
    "then , if the winding number approximately fitted by this kind of @xmath164 we can see the same phenomenon in this area .      in the tokamak",
    ", @xmath165-dependence appears in @xmath166 , so that the situation is more complicated compared with cylindrical case . in this case ,",
    "@xmath3-component of the velocity for unperturbed motion is not null , and the form of grad@xmath1 and curvature drift velocity are more complicated .",
    "then , these drift effect for the @xmath0-profile may not be clarified clearly as in the cylindrical system . if we assume the magnetic momentum @xmath167 is the third integral of the motion , the particle system can be integrable when @xmath168 , @xcite and the present result can be generalized for the tokamak .",
    "however , it should be noted that the assumption of the third integral is sometimes broken,@xcite but the generalized theory may work in some local region apart from the separatrix of @xmath169 .",
    "secondly , it might be important to mention on the edge localized mode ( elm)@xcite which is a kind of instability appearing around the h - mode and brings about heat and particles diffusion , so that it breaks good confinement of plasmas in fusion reactors .",
    "the elm is mitigated by the resonant magnetic perturbation called rmp which creates ergodic magnetic region with irrational @xmath170 .",
    "rmp is screened by the plasmas rotation with rational winding number , and the elm mitigation becomes not effective , so that the precise information about resonant location of the winding number is important to make good confinement of plasmas.@xcite as we have already seen , the particle s @xmath0-profile is different from the magnetic one @xmath170 for various classes of particles with energy levels and pitch angles .",
    "then , it might be important future work to estimate a number of particles exhibiting resonance shift and its effect to the rmp screening .",
    "finally we would like to point out , that we had mentioned that the results obtained in refs .   for a case with a finite larmor radius effect in the `` trivial '' @xmath171 setting but with an electric field with modes",
    "@xmath172 were similar to our recent result .",
    "@xcite in fact this may be partially correct , but the main underlying mechanism is not same . in the situation considered in refs .  , there are neither curvature nor grad @xmath1 drifts , so that the effective safety factor modifications discussed in this article can not occur , as clearly the role of the perturbation induced by the electric field is dominant , while the magnetic perturbations appeared in the end as not so important in our present case . in this spirit , although the phenomena observed in refs .",
    "are apparently similar to the ones reported in ref .  , and",
    "since the mechanisms are different , we believe that a precise study when both electric field and non - uniform magnetic field can be an interesting line of research for future work .",

    "<S> charged particles with low kinetic energy move along magnetic field lines , but so do not energetic particles . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the topological structure changes in the phase space of energetic particles with respect to the magnetic one . for this study cylindrical magnetic fields with non - monotonic safety factors that induce the magnetic internal transport barrier </S>",
    "<S> are considered . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the topological structure of the magnetic field line and of the particle trajectories can be quite different . </S>",
    "<S> we explain this difference using the concept of effective particle @xmath0-profile . using this notion </S>",
    "<S> we can investigate the location and existence of resonances for particle orbits that are different from the magnetic ones . </S>",
    "<S> these are examined both numerically by integrating an equation of motion and theoretically by use of alfvn s guiding center theory and by use of the effective reduced hamiltonian for the integrable unperturbed system . </S>",
    "<S> it is clarified that , for the energetic particles , the grad @xmath1 drift effect shifts the resonances and the drift induced by curvature of the magnetic field line leads to the vanishing of the resonances . as a result , we give two different mechanisms that lead to the creation of transport barriers for energetic particles in the region where the magnetic field line is chaotic . </S>"
