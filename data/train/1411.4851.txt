    "the two most common approaches to credit risk modelling are the _ structural _ approach , pioneered in the seminal work of merton @xcite , and the _ reduced - form _ approach which can be traced back to early works of jarrow , lando , and turnbull @xcite and to @xcite . in structural approaches",
    ", default happens when the company is not able to meet its obligations or a certain lower bound is hit by the value of the firm s assets . in many cases",
    "this happens when a promised payment can not be made , which in the approaches in @xcite and its extensions @xcite leads to default at pre - specified times , such as coupon dates .",
    "the recently missed coupon payment by argentina is an example for such a credit event as well as the default of greece on the 1st of july .",
    "the possibility that default happens at a predictable time is in strong contrast to most reduced - form approaches : the class of so - called _ intensity - based _ models is characterized by the property , that the default time admits an intensity and hence it avoids predictable and in particular deterministic times . for a review and guide to the rich literature on this subject we refer to @xcite .    despite their theoretical appeal ,",
    "structural models pose a number of challenges when used for pricing credit derivatives : first , the underlying value of the firm is difficult to observe .",
    "this fact motivated approaches with incomplete information , see @xcite .",
    "second , the full priority hierarchy of the firm s capital structure is needed which additionally complicates the matter .",
    "reduced - form approaches circumvent these difficulties and are less ambitious about the precise mechanism leading to default , see for example @xcite .",
    "closely related are dynamic term structure approaches following the pioneering work of heath - jarrow - morton ( hjm ) , @xcite , and its extension to default risk , cf .",
    "one offspring of this approach are highly tractable affine and quadratic factor models , see @xcite .",
    "it is a remarkable observation of @xcite that it is possible to extend the reduced - form approach beyond the class of intensity - based models .",
    "the authors study a class of first - passage time models under a filtration generated by a brownian motion and show its use for pricing and modelling credit risky bonds .",
    "our goal is to start with even weaker assumptions on the default time and to allow for jumps in the compensator of the default time at predictable times . from this general viewpoint",
    "it turns out , surprisingly , that previously used hjm approaches lead to arbitrage : the whole term structure is absolutely continuous and can not compensate for points in time bearing a positive default probability .",
    "we propose a suitable extension with an additional term allowing for discontinuities in the term structure at certain random times and derive precise drift conditions for an appropriate no - arbitrage condition , no asymptotic free lunch ( nafl ) .",
    "there are approaches that bridge the gap between structural and reduced - form models , for example by considering an incomplete or noisy observation of the firm value .",
    "the first work in this direction , @xcite , studied a first - passage time approach proposed in @xcite and showed that under incomplete information one arrives at an intensity - based model .",
    "this property can , however , not be extended to structural models where default happens at a fixed time with positive probability , like in the merton model or its extensions .",
    "this underlines the importance of a general approach in this regard and we provide some illustrating examples .",
    "even more , this observation motivates a specific class of models , which we call extended merton models , where default may happen at deterministic times with positive probability . in this class",
    "we can develop highly tractable factor models and we propose a new class of affine models , which are not stochastically continuous , matching this natural property of a generalized merton model .",
    "certainly , our approach is intimately related to the theory of enlargement of filtrations .",
    "we provide a simple example inspired by filtering theory where the azma supermartingale contains upward and downward jumps , both at predictable and totally inaccessible stopping times .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in section [ sec : tau ] , we introduce the general setting and study drift conditions in an extended hjm - framework which guarantee absence of arbitrage in the bond market . in section",
    "[ sec : merton ] we additionally assume that default may happen with positive probability only at a finite number of deterministic times and study the absence of arbitrage in this class , which we call generalized merton models .",
    "section [ sec : filtering ] studies structural models under incomplete information in detail .",
    "besides this , we construct a default time where the azma supermartingale naturally has upward and downward jumps by means of filtering methods . in section [ sec : doublystochastic ] we give a precise construction of arbitrage - free hjm - models in a doubly - stochastic setting while section [ secaffine ] studies a new class of affine models which are stochastically discontinuous . section [",

    "consider a filtered probability space @xmath0 with a filtration @xmath1 satisfying the usual conditions , i.e.  it is right - continuous and @xmath2 contains the @xmath3-nullsets @xmath4 of @xmath5 . throughout , the probability measure @xmath3 denotes the objective measure .",
    "as we use tools from stochastic analysis , all appearing filtrations shall satisfy the usual conditions .",

    "<S> the two main approaches in credit risk are the structural approach pioneered in merton ( 1974 ) and the reduced - form framework proposed in jarrow & turnbull ( 1995 ) and in artzner & delbaen ( 1995 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this article is to provide a unified view on both approaches . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by studying reduced - form approaches under weak assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we do not assume the global existence of a default intensity and allow default at fixed or predictable times with positive probability , such as coupon payment dates .    </S>",
    "<S> in this generalized framework we study dynamic term structures prone to default risk following the forward - rate approach proposed in heath - jarrow - morton ( 1992 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out , that previously considered models lead to arbitrage possibilities when default may happen at a predictable time with positive probability . a suitable generalization of the forward - rate approach contains </S>",
    "<S> an additional stochastic integral with atoms at predictable times and necessary and sufficient conditions for an appropriate no - arbitrage condition ( nafl ) are given . </S>",
    "<S> in the view of efficient implementations we develop a new class of affine models which do not satisfy the standard assumption of stochastic continuity .    the chosen approach is intimately related to the theory of enlargement of filtrations , to which we provide a small example by means of filtering theory where the azma supermartingale contains upward and downward jumps , both at predictable and totally inaccessible stopping times . </S>"
