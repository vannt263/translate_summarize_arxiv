    "turbulent transport processes refer to the advection of a transported field @xmath1 ( scalar or vector ) by a turbulent velocity field @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the basic equation of motion is linear , having the form @xmath3 here @xmath4 is an operator that is built out of the turbulent velocity field , and as such may be stochastic .",
    "examples are the advection of a passive scalar @xmath5 , with the equation of motion @xmath6 or a vector , like a magnetic field @xmath7 satisfying @xcite @xmath8 we may also consider advection , as in @xcite , of a vector field @xmath9 whose divergence vanishes , @xmath10 : @xmath11 in all these equations the velocity field @xmath12 comes from either a solution of a fluid - mechanical equation , or is a random field defined with some statistical properties .",
    "a fundamental consequence of the linearity of the equations of motion is that the correlation functions may be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an average over the statistics of the initial conditions _ and _ the statistics of the advecting velocity field .",
    "the notation @xmath15 is used for simplicity .",
    "note that we have used the passive nature of the transported field , i.e. the fact that the velocity is independent of the _ initial _ distribution of @xmath16 , to separate the averages over the initial conditions and the velocity .",
    "such a decoupling can not be afforded at any other time because of the build - up of correlations between the advecting and advected fields .",
    "the linear operator @xmath17 propagates the @xmath18th - order correlation function from time zero to time @xmath19 .",
    "the evolution operator @xmath20 generally includes dissipative terms , and without fresh input ( forcing ) the statistics of the field @xmath16 is time - dependent ; this is the _ decaying _ case , eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) .",
    "a related problem of much experimental and theoretical interest is _ forced _ turbulent transport where an input term @xmath21 is added to the eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) .",
    "the situations of interest in turbulence typically involve an input acting only at large scales of order @xmath22 .",
    "the objects of major interest are the stationary correlation functions @xmath23 of the advected field , @xmath24 one cares about the scaling properties at distances much smaller than @xmath22 and at the stationary state . as usual in turbulent flows , the correlation functions of the advected field are expected to contain anomalous contributions behaving as @xmath25 with scaling exponents @xmath26 which can not be inferred from dimensional analysis .",
    "recently @xcite , two conjectures were proposed , pertaining to a wide variety of turbulent transport processes , without special provisos on the properties of the advecting velocity field : +   + ( i ) in the decaying case , despite the non - stationarity of the statistics , there exist special functions @xmath27 such that @xmath28 are statistical integrals of motion . in the limit of infinitely large system @xmath29",
    "does not change with time .",
    "it follows from ( [ propagator ] ) and the conservation of @xmath30 that in the infinite size limit the @xmath31 s are left - eigenfunctions of the operator : @xmath32 note that this does not mean that the operator @xmath33 admits an eigenvector decomposition , and see below for a further discussion of this point .",
    ".2 cm ( ii ) the anomalous part of the stationary correlation functions in the forced problem is dominated by statistically conserved structures . in other words , at least in the scaling sense @xmath34",
    "a direct consequence is that the small - scale statistics of the transported field @xmath16 in the forced case rests on the understanding of the decaying problem .",
    "a by - product is that the scaling exponents @xmath26 are universal , i.e. independent of the forcing mechanisms for any forcing that is statistically independent of the velocity field .",
    "the conjectures were exemplified in the context of shell models of passive scalar advection .",
    "the model s equations read @xcite @xmath35 where the variables @xmath36 are generated by the `` sabra '' shell model @xcite @xmath37 here the coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are real . in eqs .",
    "( [ passive ] ) and ( [ sabra ] ) the wavevectors are @xmath41 . the velocity forcing @xmath42",
    "is limited to the first shell @xmath43 . for @xmath44 and @xmath45 the energies",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 are _ dynamically conserved _ , i.e. realization by realization .",
    "the statistical physics of this model were studied carefully @xcite in the regime of @xmath48 .",
    "taking the forcing to be random ( with random phases ) leads to non - trivial statistics of the velocity field , with anomalous exponents that characterize the scaling behavior of the correlation functions .    the operator @xmath49 of eqs .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) , ( [ eig ] ) takes here the explicit form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52\\right]_{n , m}\\ , \\label{rnm}\\ ] ] with @xmath53 being the time ordering operator .",
    "note that for notational simplicity we dropped the dependence on the initial time from @xmath49 , but left it , for future purposes , in @xmath54 .    to demonstrate the _ statistical _ conservation laws , two things were done @xcite .",
    "first the forced problem was considered , adding random forcing to eq .",
    "( [ passive ] ) : @xmath55 due to phase symmetry constraints @xcite , there is only one non - zero second order correlation , but a number of different higher order ones .",
    "for example , the correlation @xmath56 is not zero . for concreteness",
    "we concentrated our attention to the following ones ( we put a subscript @xmath21 to stress that these are statistical averages in the stationary forced ensemble ) : @xmath57 and following their evolution .",
    "the following objects were then computed : @xmath58th order decaying correlation functions themselves , ( ii ) the time dependence of @xmath30 . in panel ( c )",
    "we show also for comparison the time dependence of @xmath59 if we replace the measured forced @xmath60 by its dimensional shell dependence ( i.e. the shell dependence if the kolmogorov theory were right ) .",
    "we see that only the properly computed @xmath61 are time independent for times smaller than the large scale eddy turn over time , @xmath62 .",
    "the decay observed for times larger than @xmath62 is simply due to finite size effects intervening when the decaying field reaches the largest scales .    in trying to understand these results , it is very tempting to interpret eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) as an eigenvalue equation , with @xmath31 being an eigenfunction of eigenvalue 1 .",
    "unfortunately , the operator @xmath63 is not hermitian , and in addition it does not lend itself to an expansion in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues : it is not defined on a compact space .",
    "there are two  non - compact \" directions , that of length scale and that of time .",
    "we thus need to learn how to take care of these before we can write down a proper theory .    in the context of the passive scalar advection problem , eq .",
    "( [ pas ] ) , these issues were solved elegantly in the framework of lagrangian dynamics @xcite . for the passive scalar equation ( [ pas ] )",
    "the advected field is conserved along the trajectories of the tracer particles @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a brownian process . to know the scalar field at position @xmath66 and time @xmath19 it is enough to track the corresponding tracer particle back to its initial position @xmath67 . the evolution operator @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) coincides then with the probability density that @xmath18 tracer particles reach the positions @xmath69 at time @xmath19 given their initial positions @xmath70 .",
    "for example , to understand the exponent @xmath71 one needs to focus on the dynamics of three tracer particles . obviously , three particles define at any moment of time a triangle , which in turn is fully characterized by one length scale @xmath72 ( say the sum of the lengths of its sides ) , two of its internal angles , and all the angles that specify the orientation of the triangle in space .",
    "when the particles are advected by the turbulent velocity field , the scale @xmath72 of the triangle and its shape ( angles ) change continuously .",
    "the statement that can be made is that _ there exist distributions on the space of the triangle configurations , that are statistically invariant to the turbulent dynamics _ @xcite . in other words , if we release trios of lagrangian tracers many times into the turbulent fluid , and we choose the distribution of their shapes and sizes correctly , it will remain invariant to the turbulent advection@xcite .",
    "such statistically conserved structures are the aforementioned zero modes and they come to dominate the statistics of the scalar field at small scales .",
    "the anomalous exponents of the zero modes , such as @xmath71 , can be understood as the rescaling exponents characterizing precisely such special distributions .",
    "of course , the same ideas apply to any order correlation function with the appropriate shape dynamics .",
    "the relevance of lagrangian trajectories can be also demonstrated for the magnetic field case ( [ magnetic ] ) , by adding a tangent vector to the tracer particle , and see @xcite for more details .",
    "the problem of non - compactness due to the explicit time dependence of the operator is taken care here by expressing time in terms of a single scale variable @xmath72 , using the richardson law of turbulent diffusion @xcite .",
    "then instead of looking at the problem on the non - compact space of particle separation , one focuses on the space of shapes which is compact , and in which one can demonstrate the existence of eigenfucntions and eigenvalues @xcite . obviously , for the case of the shell model considered here we can not repeat verbatim the same ideology .",
    "there are no  shapes \" , and it is not immediately obvious how to relate time to scales .",
    "the lagrangian invariance is broken by the discretization of shell space , and the genericity of the time properties of the velocity field does not allow explicit calculations of the operator @xmath73 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to achieve the equivalent understanding for the shell model , that in @xcite was orginally chosen to be as far removed as possible from the continuous passive scalar problem .",
    "we will discover that also in this case there is a typical  moving \" scale that carries the explicit time dependence . by considering",
    "the relevant operators with shell indices expressed in terms of the moving scale , we compactify the picture with respect to its time dependence .",
    "moreover , in this moving frame we will discover that the operators decay rapidly as a function of shell differences .",
    "this will allow us to compactify the theory altogether and to offer a satisfactory understanding of the existence of the statistically preserved structures and its implication for the forced problem .    in sect .",
    "2 we present the theory for 2nd order objects . on the basis of numerical simulations",
    "we offer an analytic form for the operator @xmath74 .",
    "we show that it has an explicit time dependence in addition to a dependence on a moving scale that we identify analytically . in sect .",
    "3 we use the explicit form of @xmath74 to explain why @xmath75 is a statistical constant of the motion .",
    "the basic property that is crucial is the effective compactness of the operator in the space of shells , once it is expressed in terms of the moving scale .",
    "next we show how the forced stationary correlation function @xmath76 is obtained by solving the forced problem with the same propagator @xmath74 .",
    "finally we derive the fact that @xmath76 acts as a left - eigenvector of @xmath74 with eigenvalue 1 . to help in throwing light on some issues we also consider in this section a simple model obtained by replacing the sabra model for the velocity field by a delta - function correlated field ( the kraichnan shell model @xcite ) . in sects . 4 and 5 we turn to a discussion of the 4th order objects .",
    "we proceed in parallel to what had been achieved in sects . 2 and 3 .",
    "we first derive , on the basis of simulations and the fusion rules @xcite , the analytic form of @xmath77 . using this form we explain why @xmath78 is a statistical constant of the motion when the stationary correlation function @xmath79 is identified with @xmath80 .",
    "last we turn to the forced problem , and demonstrate that @xmath79 is indeed the forced solution .",
    "this calculation is not trivial , calling for a careful discussion of the time - decay and decorrelation properties of the operators @xmath81 . throughout the discussion",
    "we make use of the simpler kraichnan shell model in which the operators are all computed analytically ( see appendix ) to further our understanding of the generic case . in sect .",
    "6 we present a discussion and a summary of the paper .",
    "one very important conclusion is that we can in fact offer an _",
    "analytic solution _ for the time- dependent correlation functions in the decaying case ; this is a considerable bonus of the present approach .",
    "in this section we analyze the form of the 2nd order propagator that governs the dynamics of the second order passive structure function .",
    "it is defined by : @xmath82 the statistics of the advected field is independent of the statistics of the velocity field . using simulations we can generate the matrix representation of @xmath83 column by column by initiating a decaying simulation ( without forcing ) starting with @xmath0-function initial conditions in shell @xmath84 . measuring @xmath85 and averaging over many realizations of the sabra velocity field we collect data for @xmath83 .    in fig .",
    "[ pnm ] we show a typical column of @xmath83 , where @xmath86 .",
    "we used 28 shells in both sabra and the passive field , with the dissipative scales being around @xmath87 .",
    "-0.5 cm = 8truecm = 8truecm    we observe two effects .",
    "first , the overall area under the curve decreases with time , this is the effect of the dissipation .",
    "second , the maximum in the curve shifts to lower shell numbers .",
    "these are the two issues that we need to tackle , the time dependence and the increase in length scale ( or , equivalently the decrease in shell number ) , which contribute to the non - compact nature of our operator .    in attempting to contain these two issues we try the following ansatz for the propagator : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a typical time scale associated with the shell in which the simulation was initiated .",
    "we use below @xmath90 with @xmath91 being the scaling exponent of the second order structure function , cf .",
    "( [ dilation ] ) . accordingly , all times @xmath19 below are also measured in units of @xmath92 .",

    "we draw the attention of the reader to the fact that the function shown in fig .",
    "[ pnmt ] falls off sharply around the maximum",
    ". this will be the clue to understanding how to remove the noncompact dependence on the ever increasing scale @xmath104 .",
    "sums over @xmath105 will be extended below from @xmath106 to @xmath107 , with impunity .",
    "the important conclusion is that to a good approximation the following sum @xmath108 is time independent .",
    "next we want to find an analytic expression for the moving scale @xmath98 . in order to find the time behavior of the peak we examine eq .",

    "( [ disp2 ] ) , we note that for this linear problem the shell @xmath112 from which the dissipation of the scalar becomes significant is independent of the scalar value ( and thus time independent ) .",
    "we can estimate it by comparing the terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ passive ] ) : @xmath113 we can now estimate the scalar dissipation , under the approximation that it takes place mainly in shells with @xmath114 . in this region the value of @xmath85 begins to fall off exponentially with @xmath115 , and the sum in eq .",

    "thus for large times we will use @xmath123 note that for large time ( @xmath119 ) , @xmath98 becomes independent of @xmath84 .",
    "this is approporiate , since the exponential increase in typical time scales @xmath124 when the shell index decreases implies that the position of the maximum becomes independent of its initial position .",
    "we can now express the time dependence of the operator @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ pform ] ) , solely through the time behavior of @xmath98 , by inverting eq .",
    "( [ mform ] ) , to find @xmath19 :",
    "@xmath125 having done so , we have gotten rid altogether of the explicit time dependence of @xmath83 .",
    "note that the depndence of the operator on both its shell indices turns naturally to a dependence on the difference between these indices and the single moving shellthis is the first important step in overcoming the non - compactness of our 2nd order operator .",
    "at this point we can reap the benefit of the explicit form of the 2nd order propagator eq .",

    "first we derive the existence of the statistical constant of the motion @xmath75 .      returning to the definition of @xmath75 , eq .",
    "( [ i2def ] ) , and recognizing that @xmath126 ( which is also demonstrated in the next subsection ) , we see that we need to evaluate the weighted sum @xmath127 .",

    "therefore we have : @xmath130 , since we need to eliminate the effects of exponentially decaying initial value terms that do not contribute to the stationary forced correlation function . with a force which is gaussian white noise ,",
    "we write @xmath131 we remind the reader that @xmath124 is the time it takes for the initial @xmath0-function to develop a `` scaling tail '' for @xmath132 , and now @xmath84 is the shell at which the random forcing is localized .",
    "the idea here is to use the fact that we know how to eliminate the time variable in favor of the moving scale variable @xmath98 . changing variables of integration to @xmath133 , using eq .",
    "( [ mform ] ) we can write explicitly for @xmath134 : @xmath135 note that we have extended in a formal manner the range of shell indices all the way to @xmath106 , to allow for a long development of a self similar solution .",
    "naturally , since the integral converges quickly , this is immaterial .",
    "finally , using ( [ f2def ] ) : @xmath136 this solution has the expected @xmath137 , and is time independent .",

    "eigenfunction of eigenvalue 1 in eq .",
    "( [ evalsum ] ) .",
    "thus the first two subsections together fully demonstrate the two conjectures ( i ) and ( ii ) from the introduction for the case of the second order objects .",
    "the knowledgeable reader might have noticed at this point that the explicit time dependence of the 2nd order propagator , as displayed in eq .",
    "( [ pform ] ) is very simple .",
    "the exponent of time , @xmath139 , is not anomalous , and appears independent of the second order exponent of the velocity field .",
    "this is not so in the understood example of the kraichnan model of passive scalar advection , in which the time dependence of the operator is anomalous @xcite . to clarify this point we turn to the analysis of the passive scalar shell model driven by a @xmath0-correlated velocity field @xcite . in other words , for the velocity field @xmath140 in eq .",

    "in summary , we examined in detail the statistical physics of the shell model of a passive scalar advected by a turbulent velocity field .",
    "we presented a theory to explain and solidify the two conjectures proposed in @xcite and reproduced in the introduction .",
    "these conjectures state that ( i ) in the decaying problem there exist infinitely many statistically conserved quantities , denoted above as @xmath29 ; ( ii ) these quantities are obtained by integrating ( or summing ) the decaying correlation functions against the stationary correlation functions of the forced problem .",
    "we have pointed out that the conjectures imply that the forced solutions are _",
    "left_-eigenvectors of eigenvalue 1 of the propagators @xmath49 . for the model discussed above",
    "we have established these conjectures by examining the form of the propagators @xmath49 . using numerical simulations as a clue ,",
    "we proposed analytic expressions for the operators @xmath74 and @xmath77 , pointing out that similar concepts ( fusion rules @xcite in particular ) can be used to write down also the higher order operators .",
    "we checked the analytic forms against the simulations , and proceeded to demonstrate that the forced , stationary correlation functions are indeed left - eigenvectors of eigenvalue 1 of these operators .",
    "this implies that the objects @xmath29 are indeed constants of the motion .",
    "next we derived the forced , stationary correlation functions , and showed that the form of our operators dictates scaling solutions in agreement with the fusion rules . as a result",
    "the two conjectures were confirmed . in our analytic calculations",
    "we used repeatedly the fact that the operators  compactify \" in shell - space once expressed in terms of a single moving scale whose dynamics was determined analytically .",
    "one should state a caveat at this point : the analytic form of the opeartors @xmath74 and @xmath77 was _ guessed _ on the basis of numerics and the fusion rules .",
    "although they appear to agree with the simulations , we can not state that the forms are _",
    "exact_. accordingly , until these forms are derived from first principles , the exact status of the conjectures is not established .",
    "it may be that the conjectures are only satisfied to a good approximation .",
    "this question needs to be addressed in future research .    notwithstanding this caveat",
    ", we should point out a surprising bonus of the approach discussed in this paper : we have at hand an analytic form of the propagators .",
    "_ we can thus provide analytic predictions for the decaying correlation functions for arbitrary initial conditions_. considering that the velocity field is a solution of a highly non - trivial chaotic dynamical system , and that the passive scalar is slaved to it , it is quite gratifying that nevertheless one can offer analytic solutions for the time - dependent correlation functions of the latter .",
    "it is of course very tempting to hope that a similar theory can be developed in other cases of turbulent transport , leading to analytic predictability of the time - dependent correlation functions in the decaying case .",
    "since this paper demonstrated that the lagrangian structure is not a prerequisite for the exisitence of statistically preserved structures , we feel that such a theory should be sought in the eulerian frame in which calculations are much easier than in the lagrangian frame .",
