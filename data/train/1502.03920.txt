    "the study of superfluid dynamics in neutron stars has gained momentum recently with the observation of fast cooling of the neutron star in cassiopeia a ( cas a ) @xcite .",
    "it has been inferred that the rapid cooling in the neutron star in cas a might be the outcome of neutron superfluidity in its interior@xcite .",
    "the glitch phenomenon in neutron stars might also be strong evidence of the superfluidity in the crust and core of a neutron star @xcite . there might be an interplay between the superfluidity in neutron stars and superfluidity studied in the laboratory .",
    "one important aspect of the superfluidity is the entrainment effect which was found in a mixture of superfluid @xmath3he and @xmath4he in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "a similar effect might occur in superfluid neutron stars when neutron and proton fluids pass through each other . in this case , the two fluids are coupled because the momentum of one fluid carries along with it some mass current of the other fluid .",
    "this is known as the entrainment effect .",
    "the entrainment effect in superfluid neutron star matter was calculated in relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models @xcite .",
    "comer and joynt exploited the @xmath0-@xmath1 walecka model for this purpose .",
    "however , neutron star matter is highly asymmetric , and the role of symmetry energy is very important in determining the equation of state ( eos ) and the structures of neutron stars .",
    "it is expected that the symmetry energy might also influence the entrainment effect .",
    "recently we investigated the entrainment effect in the the rmf model including @xmath2 mesons @xcite .",
    "we showed that the symmetry energy significantly affected the entrainment effect compared to the case without @xmath2 mesons @xcite .",
    "it may be worth mentioning here that the dependence of the entrainment effect on the symmetry energy was also studied using polytropic equations of state @xcite as well as with relativistic fermi liquid theory @xcite .",
    "the role of the entrainment effect in rotating neutron stars was investigated in newtonian as well as general relativistic formulations by different groups @xcite . in some of those calculations ,",
    "the dependence of the entrainment effect on the symmetry energy was considered through the polytropic eos @xcite .",
    "however , so far , there is no calculation of rotating neutron stars based on the isospin dependent entrainment effect derived from a realistic eos .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the role of isospin dependent entrainment on slowly rotating superfluid neutron stars . here",
    "we adopt the two - fluid formalism for slowly rotating superfluid neutron stars as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the paper is organised in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the formalism for calculating the isospin dependent entrainment in a rmf model of dense baryonic matter and the application of hartle s slow rotation approximation to einstein s field equations for superfluid neutron stars .",

    "it is manifestly evident that neutron or proton momentum is a linear combination of both number density currents .",
    "the magnitudes of which are chemical potentials of neutron and proton fluids , respectively @xcite .",
    "the charge - neutral proton fluid is composed of protons and electrons , and it was shown that the chemical potential of the proton fluid is the sum of proton and electron chemical potentials @xcite . the master function is independent of the entrainment effect ; i.e. , @xmath15 when the coefficient @xmath16 is zero .",
    "one obtains the coefficients of eqs .",
    "( [ coef1 ] ) and ( [ coef2 ] ) from the master function , @xmath17 the field equations for neutrons and protons involve two conservation equations as well as two euler equations .    in the slow rotation approximation ,",
    "the master function is written in terms of @xmath18 , which is small with respect to @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20    using this form of master function , the coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc . , that determine the nonrotating background configuration are calculated easily @xcite .",
    "for the slow rotation approximation , we are interested in terms up to second order in the rotational velocities of neutrons and protons .",
    "this corresponds to the terms proportional to @xmath23 in the master function .",
    "it may be noted that the following combinations appearing in the field equations are dependent on @xmath24 when computed on the background @xcite : @xmath25    the calculation of the master function in the rmf model was described in detail in refs.@xcite .",
