    "the understanding of formation and evolution of the observable universe is the main theme of modern cosmology . about the former problem",
    ", there are several candidates including the standard cosmological model which predicts a singularity out of which our universe was born , while it predicts nothing about what happened before that .",
    "other models like braneworlds and cyclic models predict a cyclic nature of cosmic evolution , according to which universe evolves from one singular state ( big bang ) to another one @xcite .",
    "another interesting theoretical problem is the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration occurring at present time , usually attributed to ` dark energy ' ( de ) .",
    "there are numerous approaches to study this phenomena @xcite , however , it is fair to say that none of them is particularly well motivated , and many of them appear like acts of desperation on the part of theorists .",
    "from this situation we sometimes come to the conclusion that perhaps we must return to the origin and study in detail the mathematical nature of the basic gravitational equations .",
    "following this idea we have studied some integrable and non - integrable reductions of the einstein equation ( friedmann equation ) in @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite , we have established the relationship between solutions of the einstein equation and the ramanujan and chazy equations .    returning to a cyclic scenario which in fact was proposed long time ago @xcite we note that the idea to consider the whole universe as one cyclic system has already attracted many authors . in particular , it has achieved a lot of successes in recent decades ( see e.g. refs . @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of interesting aspects of cyclic scenario is its possible connection with the knot scenario proposed in @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "one of important branches of mathematics ( algebraic geometry ) , the knot theory describe a debth properties of the 3-dimensional space @xcite-@xcite . so that these arguments in our opinion give us physical and mathematical motivations in order to futher investigation the relationship between cyclic universe models and knot universe models .",
    "in this paper , we study in more detail the relationship between some models of the cyclic universe and the knot theory .",
    "as examples we consider the trefoil and figure - eight knot universe models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly give some basic equations of the einstein gravity . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to study the relation between the friedmann equation with some equation of state and the trefoil knot and sec .",
    "iv with the figure - eight knot .",
    "some similar models of a cyclic universe are studied in sec.v .",
    "a new realizations of knot universes for the bianchi - i models are considered in sec .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in this section we briefly review some basic facts about the einstein s field equation .",
    "we start from the standard gravitational action ( chosen units are @xmath0 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the ricci scalar , @xmath3 is the cosmological constant and @xmath4 is the matter lagrangian . for a general metric @xmath5 ,",
    "the line element is @xmath6 the corresponding einstein field equations are given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the ricci tensor .",
    "this equation forms the mathematical basis of the theory of general relativity . in ( 3 ) , @xmath9 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter field defined as @xmath10 and satisfies the conservation equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the covariant derivative which is the relevant operator to smooth a tensor on a differentiable manifold . eq .",
    "( 5 ) yields the conservations of energy and momentums , corresponding to the independent variables involved .",
    "the general einstein equation ( 3 ) is a set of non - linear partial differential equations .",
    "we consider the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric which represents a spatial and homogeneous spacetime relevant to cosmological perspective .",
    "this metric has the form ( in suitable dimensionless coordinates ) @xmath13 here we employed the following notations @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 for making the above equation dimensionless .",
    "quantities with subscript 0 refer to their values at present epoch , that is @xmath18 are some constants .",
    "we write the corresponding einstein equations ( friedmann equation and the conservation equation ) in the following dimensionless form @xmath19 where @xmath20 , is the dimensionless hubble parameter and @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the density of energy and @xmath23 is the pressure . with the use of dimensionless variables , all the equations in this paper",
    "become dimensionless .",
    "out of the three equations ( 7)-(9 ) , only two are independent i.e. ( 7 ) and ( 8) or ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) .",
    "the aim of this and next sections is to establish a connection between the cyclic universe models with the knot theory . in this section we want to construct the simplest examples of the knot universe , namely , the trefoil knot universe .",
    "let us consider some explicit examples .",
    "let the equation of state ( eos ) that is the pressure @xmath23 and energy density @xmath22 have the following forms @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is another dimensionless parameter .",
    "now substituting these expressions for the energy density and the pressure into the equations ( 7)-(8 ) , we get @xmath26 such periodic hubble s parameters are familiar from previous works on occurrence of an oscillating universe , it has been shown using an inhomogeneous equation of state for dark energy fluid , the hubble parameter presents a periodic behavior such that early and late time acceleration are unified under the same mechanism @xcite .        upon integration",
    ", we obtain the scale factor for this model @xmath27},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the value of scale factor taken at present time . having obtained relevant parameters , we can discuss some cosmological implications of this model .",
    "the first quantity is deceleration parameter @xmath29 defined as @xmath30 a universe expanding with acceleration ( deceleration ) has @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . since the observable universe is currently in accelerated expansion , we demand @xmath33 . thus using ( 12 ) and ( 14 )",
    "we have @xmath34    the eos parameter for this example is given by @xmath35 figure ( 1 ) shows time evolution of the @xmath36 given by ( 12 ) .",
    "it may be non differentiable @xcite .",
    "it can be used for a periodic behavior such that early and late time acceleration are unified under the same mechanism .",
    "let us introduce three new variables as @xmath37 using the above expressions of @xmath36 and @xmath38 , we can rewrite equations ( 17)-(19 ) as @xcite @xmath39 eqs .",
    "( 20 - 22 ) are nothing but the parametric equations for the trefoil knot ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this curve lies entirely on the torus @xmath40 making trefoil the simplest example of a torus knot .",
    "in fact , the trefoil is a ( 2,3)-torus knot because the curve winds around the torus thrice in one direction and twice in the other direction .",
    "we consider the scale factor of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and assume @xmath43 .",
    "thus the hubble parameter becomes @xmath44_{\\tau}=-\\frac{3\\sin ( 3\\tau)\\cos ( 2\\tau)+2(2+\\cos ( 3\\tau))\\sin ( 2\\tau)}{(2+\\cos ( 3\\tau))\\cos ( 2\\tau)}.\\ ] ] in figure 3 , we show the time evolution of @xmath45 vs @xmath46 . it describes a periodic behavior such that early and late time acceleration are unified under the same mechanism .",
    "making use of ( 7 ) , ( 8) and ( 25 ) , the energy density and pressure become @xmath47_{,\\tau}\\}^2 , \\\\          p&=&-2[\\ln ( r\\cos ( 2\\tau))]_{,\\tau\\tau}-3\\{[\\ln ( r\\cos ( 2\\tau))]_{,\\tau}\\}^2 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding parameter of the eos is @xmath48_{,\\tau\\tau}}{\\{[\\ln ( r\\cos ( 2\\tau))]_{,\\tau}\\}^2}.\\ ] ] to describe the trefoil knot , we introduce three new variables @xmath49 as : @xmath50 where @xmath51constant . in terms of @xmath46",
    "these functions take the same form as in ( 20)-(22 ) so that they describe the trefoil knot curve .",
    "this means that our model with the eos ( 28 ) corresponds to a knot universe if be exactly to the trefoil knot universe .",
    "now consider a more complex case than the previous trefoil knot universe , namely , the figure - eight knot . here some examples of such figure - eight knot universes .",
    "let the eos is given in the parametric form @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 equations ( 7)-(8 ) then give @xmath54 figure 4 shows the time evolution of the @xmath36 for this example .",
    "it may be interpreted as a periodic cosmological model , such that early and late time acceleration are unified under the same mechanism .",
    "this result ( 34 ) tells us that the scale factor has the form @xmath55}.\\ ] ] the corresponding eos parameter for this model is @xmath56 as above , we introduce three new functions as : @xmath57 this system @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 can be rewritten in parametric form as @xcite @xmath61 which is nothing but the parametric equations of the figure - eight knot ( see figure 5 ) . note that this figure - eight knot satisfies the equation @xmath62          consider the scale factor of the form @xmath63 so that the hubble parameter takes the form @xmath64_{,\\tau}=-\\frac{2\\sin ( 2\\tau)\\cos ( 3\\tau)-3(2+\\cos ( 2\\tau))\\sin ( 3\\tau)}{(2+\\cos ( 2\\tau))^2\\cos^2 ( 3\\tau)}.\\ ] ] figure 6 shows the time evolution of the @xmath36 for this example .",
    "it is a periodic cosmological model , such that the early and late time accelerations are unified under the same mechanism .",
    "then the equations ( 7)-(8 ) give the following parametric eos @xmath65_{,\\tau}\\}^2 , \\\\",
    "p&=&-2[\\ln ( h\\cos ( 3\\tau))]_{,\\tau\\tau}-3\\{[\\ln ( h\\cos ( 3\\tau))]_{,\\tau}\\}^2      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives the parameter of the eos in the form @xmath48_{,\\tau\\tau}}{\\{[\\ln ( r\\cos ( 2\\tau))]_{,\\tau}\\}^2}.\\ ] ] again we introduce three new variables @xmath66 as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 if we rewrite these equations in terms of @xmath46 then we get again the system ( 40)-(42 ) which are the parametric equations for the figure - eight knot .",
    "so this model with the eos ( 46)-(47 ) describes the figure - eight knot universe .",
    "let us consider an oscillating universe described by the hubble parameter @xmath69 then , by substituting this expression into the equations ( 7 ) , ( 8) , we obtain @xmath70 so that the eos parameter becomes @xmath71 the corresponding scale factor is @xmath72}.\\ ] ]      one can consider now an oscillating universe described by the hubble parameter @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are constants .",
    "then , by substituting this expression into the equations ( 7),(8 ) , we get @xmath76 so that the eos parameter is given by @xmath77 for the scale factor we get @xmath78}.\\ ] ]      let s take @xmath79 then , the hubble parameter becomes @xmath80 by substituting this expression into the equations ( 7)-(8 ) , it yields , @xmath81}{(\\alpha+\\beta \\cos^2 ( \\nu \\tau))^2}.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the eos parameter is given by @xmath82      our next example is : @xmath83 then , the hubble parameter becomes @xmath84 by substituting this expression into the equations ( 7)-(8 ) , we obtain @xmath85 so that the eos parameter simplifies to @xmath86      general model of a cyclic universe : we introduce @xmath87 we get @xmath88 hence we have @xmath89},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where elliptice is an elliptic integral of second kind .",
    "the eos of the model is @xmath90 one can find a new set of coordinates @xmath91 such as ( 40)-(42 ) , and show that there are some knot like figures in a configuration space of these coordinates .",
    "going to some mathematical structures , the knot theory , we studied the relations between some oscillatory solutions of the frw equations and the geometrical picture of some types of the knot . we show that , by assuming the periodic forms for pressure and energy density as a functions of time , there exists a coordinate set , in which the time evolutions of the space is knot like .",
    "this formal similarity repeated when we examined other types of the matter density and the pressure .",
    "our work , exhibited some interesting features of the rich , hidden , mathematical structures of the non - linear frw equations . also , we discussed some models , described the existence of a cyclic universe .",
    "we obtained the exact solutions for the scale factor , the eos parameter @xmath92 is all models .",
    "also we have considered some examples knot universes for the bianchi - i spacetime .",
