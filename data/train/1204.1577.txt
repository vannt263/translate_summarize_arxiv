    "although there is no question that galaxy clusters are the most massive virialized objects in the universe , identifying the mass of any particular cluster remains a challenge .",
    "a cluster s mass is however one of its core properties , important for using cluster samples statistically to constrain cosmological parameters , for understanding clusters as hosts for galaxy evolution , and for studying the growth and other properties of the clusters themselves .",
    "recent reviews include @xcite .    in simulations ,",
    "the cluster mass is the sum of the masses of the simulation particles which are cluster members , for whatever cluster member ( and thus mass ) definition is used ( comparisons of some mass definitions are found in , e.g. , @xcite ) . from a given cosmological",
    "set of parameters , simulations predict well defined and directly measurable masses , accurate to the extent that the simulation captures the required physics and has the requisite resolution .",
    "these theoretical mass definitions can not be directly applied to observational data , as observations instead measure properties of galaxies both within the cluster and near the cluster , or gas within and sometimes near the cluster , or the bending of space by mass in and around the cluster .",
    "these observational mass proxies are converted , via physical modeling and assumptions , to mass measurements for comparison with theory .",
    "improvements in the noisy mappings between observationally accessible cluster properties and theoretically calculable cluster properties is much sought after by both theorists and observers .",
    "complications for observations include projection ( and more generally the lack of three dimensional information ) and reliance of the mapping between mass and observational proxy upon simplifying assumptions such as hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the simulation based theoretical approaches , for their part , find it challenging to capture the directly observable baryonic physics , including galaxy properties .    in order to alleviate systematics and reduce errors in observationally obtained cluster masses , it is becoming common to combine measurements from different ( often multiwavelength ) observational techniques .",
    "the advantages of complementary information and crosschecks are unfortunately mitigated by the fact that scatters from different observational methods are often correlated .",
    "essentially , as physical properties of the clusters themselves and their environments are often the causes of mass measurement scatters , more than one measurement technique can be affected .",
    "it is important include these correlations in order to properly estimate the errors in mass measurements of any individual cluster and to avoid a bias when stacking clusters on one property and measuring another .",

    "halos are found via friends of friends ( fof ) @xcite , with linking length @xmath12 times the mean interparticle spacing ( connecting regions with density at least roughly 100 times the mean background density ) .",
    "clusters are halos with fof masses",
    "@xmath13 ( @xmath14 hereon will mean this @xmath12 fof mass , we will also write this as @xmath15 when comparing to estimates ) .",
    "there are 243 clusters in the box .",
    "note that because we have a periodic box we do not need to worry about clusters located near the edge , similarly , because we are using fof as a halo finder , every particle is uniquely assigned to a single halo .",
    "galaxies are taken to be resolved subhalos , which are found via fof6d @xcite , with the implementation as described in the appendix of wcs .",
    "subhalos are tracked ( see @xcite for particular details ) from their infall into their host halos in order to assign luminosities via subhalo abundance matching @xcite .",
    "the resulting galaxy catalogue minimum luminosity at @xmath11 is @xmath16 ( again see wcs for more discussion and validation tests of the catalogue galaxy properties with observations ) .",

    "for every cluster , its measured sz flux is then the flux within an annulus of radius @xmath21 ( the radius within which the average mass is greater than or equal to 180 times background density ) , through the length of the box , apodized at the edges .",

    "are expected to include the majority of systematics that are present in real observations .",
    "the weak lensing and compton decrement ( sz ) observations however do not include all known systematics , such as miscentering , shape measurement and source redshift errors for lensing , and foreground and point source removal for compton decrement .",
    "the relatively small box size ( 250 @xmath6 on a side ) also means that line of sight scatter is underestimated ( e.g. , @xcite for sz and @xcite for lensing ) .",
    "we extend the cluster sample used in wcs to a lower mass range , @xmath22 , as in @xcite .",
    "the five observables listed above are found along 96 lines of sight for each cluster , each time placing the cluster at the center of the periodic box . just as in wcs ,",
    "lines of sight for clusters are removed for all measurement methods when a more massive cluster has its center within @xmath21 along the line of sight ( this removes @xmath23 of the original @xmath2423000 lines of sight ) .",
    "in addition , to allow fair intercomparisons , only lines of sight which have reliable mass measurements for all methods are included ; the @xmath25 lines of sight with fewer than 8 galaxies making the cut for a velocity dispersion estimate , or either richness @xmath26 are also removed .",
    "these cuts will have some effect on the scatters we consider but would be expected to be identifiable observationally .",
    "we take the logarithm of these observables and that of the true mass @xmath14 to find the mean relations for all clusters with @xmath27 .",
    "we find relations for bins of @xmath14 vs. observables , because of the large scatter at low mass .",
    "the fits are done by throwing out 3 @xmath28 outliers for three iterations .",
    "this gives us our map between the observables and mass estimates @xmath29 .",
    "the distribution of the fractional mass scatters , @xmath30 , for the five mass measurement methods along @xmath3 lines of sight for each of the 243 clusters , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullscatter ] .",
    "the scatters range from @xmath24 0.2 - 0.5 , with the smallest mass scatters associated with compton decrement and @xmath31 .",
    "note that this work follows a theoretical approach where all the mass measurements are related to the known true mass , a quantity inaccessible in observations .",
    "in particular , the sample is cut on the unobservable value of @xmath32 and the distributions we consider are @xmath33 , not vice versa . for an observational sample based upon some measurement @xmath34 , such as richness mass or weak lensing mass , often the quantity of interest is the scatter in @xmath35 ( see also extended comments in  [ sec : ensemble ] ) . , looks essentially gaussian , unlike the double peaked distribution found and studied in e.g. @xcite .",
    "if looking at @xmath35 , one will find clusters which are `` blends '' , i.e. several halos which contribute to one apparent halo , often with a higher @xmath34 than any of the contributing halos .",
    "these blends ( see also e.g. @xcite for discussion ) are the source of the bimodal mass distribution reported and used in these other papers . ]      in section ",
    "[ sec : scalarprops ] , cluster filament properties calculated in @xcite and cluster galaxy subgroup properties calculated in @xcite for this simulation are used .",
    "detailed background can be found in those two papers , but we briefly summarize some key aspects here .",
    "filaments are found in @xcite using a modification of the dark matter halo based filament finder of @xcite .",
    "this filament finder searches for bridges 10 @xmath6 or smaller between halos above @xmath36 , starting with the most massive halos as potential bridge endpoints . some clusters ( 16/243 )",
    "end up within filaments because of the finder , such as less massive clusters located between two close ( @xmath37 ) massive clusters and clusters closer than @xmath38 to a larger cluster .",
    "the rest of the clusters each lie at the center of a filament map extending out to 10 @xmath6 .",
    "we found that filaments , halo mass ( halos with mass @xmath39 ) and galaxy richness all tended to lie in a planar region around each cluster .",
    "we characterized these regions by taking a fiducial 3 @xmath6 high disk centered on the cluster which extends out to the edge of the radius 10 @xmath6 sphere .",
    "we use the planes related to halo and filament mass below . for halo mass",
    ", we randomly sampled 10,000 orientations to maximize the halo mass fraction in the plane ( relative to the halo mass in the 10 @xmath6 sphere ) .",
    "for filaments , we considered planes spanned by the cluster and pairs of filament endpoints , and then took the plane which enclosed the most filament mass .",
    "this plane was not found for clusters lying within filaments .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "we consider four quantities from this analysis below : @xmath40 ( halo mass fraction in plane relative to that in 10 @xmath41 sphere ) , @xmath42 ( cluster filament mass fraction in plane relative to sphere ) , and the respective plane normal directions @xmath43 .",
    "galaxy subgroups were characterized in @xcite for this simulation .",
    "these are groups of galaxies that fell into a cluster as part of a shared halo at an earlier time . within the clusters ,",
    "they share some coherence in space and time which can remain for several gyr . we will use for each cluster its largest ( richest ) galaxy subgroup , in particular its fractional richness relative to that of the cluster , @xmath44 , its displacement relative to the cluster center , divided by the cluster long axis @xmath45 , and the directions of its position and average velocity relative to the cluster center , @xmath46 .      for context and background , we summarize pca and our notation here ( see , e.g. @xcite for extensive discussion ) .",
    "pca can be used when there are several correlated or covariant quantities .",
    "it is essentially a rotation of axes to find linearly independent bases ( i.e. quantities which are not covariant or correlated ) , and is based on a model where some underlying average linear relation is present .",
    "we will apply pca in a few different contexts .",
    "our starting application will be for individual clusters .",
    "for each individual cluster and line of sight , we have several different methods to estimate the true cluster mass . each line of sight",
    "can thus be associated with five numbers , where each number is the mass measured in one method .",
    "these numbers can then be thought of as coordinates in some five dimensional abstract space , with each axis in this space corresponding to a different measurement method .",
    "all of the different lines of sight considered together then give a cloud of points in this space of measurement methods .",
    "pca gives the properties of the `` shape '' of the mass scatters in this space , around their average values for the combined observations , for each cluster .",
    "we will consider these shapes and how they relate to other cluster properties .",
    "in addition , correspondences can be found between large mass scatters and physical properties or directions of the cluster .",
    "the pca direction with smallest mass scatter is useful as well .",
    "taking the ensemble of clusters , groups of properties which change together can be inferred by using pca on the full set of correlations ( this latter approach was pioneered by @xcite ) .",
    "there are other uses of pca , and caveats as well .",
    "pca is often used to find the minimum set of variables needed to describe a system to some accuracy , for instance the dominant contributing basis vectors composing a galaxy spectrum .",
    "as far as caveats go , one concern is that if correlated variables are not scattered around a linear relation , a simple rotation of basis using pca will not usefully separate them . for this reason ,",
    "sometimes other functions are used besides the variables themselves , e.g. logarithms , when it is suspected that variables might be related by power laws .    for illustration , we take a set hypothetical measurements for two methods , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcaexplain ] .",
    "each pair of measurements , by the two methods , is a position , i.e. a dot , in this plane labeled by two coordinates .",
    "we take one coordinate to be the shifted mass using red galaxy richness , @xmath47 , and the other to be the shifted weak lensing mass , @xmath48 . here",
    ", @xmath49 denotes which particular point is being measured and the average is over all the points shown , all @xmath49 values , i.e. @xmath50 . the vector @xmath51 denotes @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the number of measurements ( points ) indexed by @xmath49 . for our first application below , all different values of @xmath49 pertain to the same cluster , but label different lines of sight .",
    "the shift by the average over all the points ( all @xmath49 ) guarantees that @xmath54 .",
    "diagonalizing the covariance matrix for @xmath55 , i.e. found by summing over all @xmath49 , produces orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath56 ( principal components ) with eigenvalues @xmath57 .",
    "the eigenvectors are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcaexplain ] and are the axes of a new coordinate system in the space of measurement methods in which the measurements have zero covariance",
    ".    the @xmath56 can be expressed in terms of the original basis directions , @xmath58 which identifies the mass scatters contributing most to each @xmath56 .",
    "for example , if @xmath59 is large , then most of the scatter in the direction of @xmath60 also lies in the direction of @xmath61 .",
    "one also sees how different scatters are related . in this simple example",
    "the biggest scatters come from increases or decreases in both @xmath62 simultaneously .",
    "this implies , in this case , that @xmath60 might be related to an average overall mass shift , amongst methods , as well .",
    "note that the overall signs for the @xmath56 are arbitrary .",
    "a point ( or vector from origin , labeled by @xmath49 ) in the original space can then be rewritten in the basis spanned by @xmath63 : @xmath64 for example , the point marked by a star in fig .",

    "that is , @xmath66 ( assuming measurements are in units of @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 .",

    "the sum of the @xmath57 , @xmath83 , is the sum of the variances of the measurement methods , their product , @xmath84 , is related to the `` volume '' in this space of scatters , i.e. how the measurements are spread out in the space of measurement methods ( specifically , for the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcaexplain ] , @xmath85 is proportional to the area of the ellipse ) .",
    "a small eigenvalue @xmath57 means that the scatter in the corresponding @xmath56 direction is small , i.e. that the volume of scatters is roughly confined to a lower dimension . in particular , if most of the scatter is due to @xmath70 , then there is a close to linear relation present .",
    "such lower dimensionality was used in @xcite to come up with scaling relations for superclusters . for pca of correlations ,",
    "a large @xmath70 occurs if the initial measurements via different methods have strong correlations ; for covariances , a large @xmath70 can also occur if an individual measurement method has large scatter .",
    "measurement methods @xmath86 ( in the example @xmath87 ) with the largest correlation or covariance with @xmath69 ( their projection on @xmath56 ) can be thought of as those dominating the scatter in the direction of @xmath56 .",
    "this covariance or correlation is not unrelated to the measurement method s contribution to @xmath56 , ( @xmath88 in eq .",
    "[ eq : betadef ] ) .",
    "the covariance or correlation is largest when @xmath88 is large , and when the eigenvalue @xmath57 is large relative to the other @xmath89 s and @xmath90 .",
    "( for pca on correlations in particular , @xmath91 ; if @xmath92 are large and @xmath93 is considered then this approaches 1 . )    to summarize , pca is a method taking a set of measurements via different methods which are correlated and separating them into uncorrelated combinations . in particular , if one denotes each set of measurements as a position in some space , along axes corresponding to each type of measurement method , then pca is a rotation of coordinates in this space .",
    "the volume and shape traced out by the points representing the measurements are related to the pc eigenvectors and eigenvalues , and the direction in the space corresponding to the largest pc eigenvector is the combination of measurement methods with the largest scatter in its distribution .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , many of the mass measurement method scatters in fig .  [ fig : fullscatter ] are comparable in size because they are due to similar properties of the cluster or its environment .",
    "correlations between the scatters are thus expected , and as noted above , these correlations and their consequences become increasingly important as multiwavelength studies become more common .",
    "we first consider each cluster and its line of sight mass scatters separately . in this way , the `` true '' object and its true mass remained fixed ; all variations in scatters are due to changes in line of sight .",
    "several examples of correlations for these scatters were already noted and illustrated in wcs , and correlations with various physical properties ( discussed below ) were further studied in @xcite .",
    "here we statistically describe these correlations and covariances .",
    "we characterize cluster to cluster trends and variations in line of sight mass scatters and predicted masses , and then apply pca to these scatters .",

    "it would also be important to include the neglected , in our simulation , line of sight larger scale scatter for sz and weak lensing and the systematics mentioned above .",
    "these would be very interesting directions to pursue in future work .",
    "in summary , in this section we considered all the clusters in the box , along all lines of sight , to see how cluster - to - cluster variation altered mass scatter relations found in earlier sections for individual clusters ; the trends remained but changed in strength .",
    "in particular , the dominant mass scatter combination , similar in form to that for many of the individual clusters , still seems to be more prevalent when looking down the long axis of the cluster or perpendicular to the mass or filament plane of the cluster .",
    "in the second subsection , we mentioned two possible methods for extending our analysis which do not require prior knowledge of @xmath15 , replacing it with the likelihood mass or a mass derived from @xmath126 .",
    "these would be interesting to apply to an observational sample , but would need a very closely matched simulation",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the resulting pc vectors and projections on them by estimated mass measurement methods have correlations with cluster orientation or perhaps @xmath132 .",
    "we have focussed on general trends above , but not all clusters ( or all lines of sight ) fell on the general trends .",
    "we searched for properties of outliers or tails in the distributions of the various quantities related to @xmath133 , outliers in average cluster measured mass vs. true cluster mass , clusters with different maximum or minimum covariance mass measurement method pairs than the majority of clusters , and clusters where @xmath134 had at least one opposite sign coefficient with absolute value @xmath135 ( i.e. largest direction of scatter not corresponding to all mass scatters increasing together , mentioned earlier ) .",
    "the various outliers did not seem to follow any pattern .",
    "some outliers were common to a cluster , e.g. sometimes a large @xmath136 outlier occurred with a large @xmath84 , as might be expected , as @xmath136 is the smallest of the @xmath133 . some of the clusters which had @xmath134 not aligned with the most likely @xmath137 had much larger contributions to mass scatter from compton decrement than the average cluster , often due to close massive halos , and @xmath138 tending to be smaller than for the usual cluster",
    ". the clusters having different correlations of lines - of - sight properties with mass measurement methods do nt seem to have a clear relation to the outliers in mass scatter properties .",
    "the scatters between estimated and true cluster masses , for different observational methods , are often correlated .",
    "understanding these correlations is becoming more and more important as reliance on multiwavelength measurements increases .",
    "for instance , correlations and covariances in scatters affect both error estimates in multiple measurements of individual clusters and produce a bias in measurements of stacked objects ( see @xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "( using the full covariance matrices has been done in some cluster analyses , e.g. by @xcite . ) we characterized the scatter and correlations of clusters in two ways .",
    "we started by considering clusters individually to identify mass scatter properties due to line of sight effects for 243 clusters in an n - body simulation , each along @xmath3 lines of sight .",
    "we used five observational mass proxies : red galaxy richness , phase space galaxy richness , sunyaev - zeldovich flux , velocity dispersions and weak lensing .",
    "it would also be very interesting to include x - ray observation as well , but our attempt at a proxy , based on assigning fractional x - ray flux to cluster galaxy subgroups , was not illuminating .",
    "these are employed to find cluster masses in current and upcoming large scale cluster surveys .    for each cluster",
    ", we characterized the `` shape '' and `` volume '' of the mass scatters of @xmath34 calculated as a function of @xmath15 , using pca , or principal component analysis , to obtain a set of non - covariant measurements .",
    "most clusters had one combination of observational mass scatters contributing the majority of the mass scatter , and this combination was similar for many of the clusters , i.e. they had a similar largest principal component @xmath134 .",
    "this scatter combination was a larger fraction of the total line of sight mass scatter when the cluster was observed along the long axis of the cluster .",
    "weaker relations with observations along other cluster intrinsic and environmental axes were seen .",
    "identifying the long axis of course requires the clusters to have non - spherical shapes . in our case",
    "the cluster member dark matter particles were determined using the fof finder with linking length @xmath12 .",
    "individual cluster mass scatter properties due to line of sight effects were then compared to several intrinsic and environmental cluster properties , including triaxiality , planarity of filament or halo mass in the immediate neighborhood of the cluster and relative richness of largest galaxy subgroup within the cluster .",
    "for example , pairwise correlations , and their combined effects using pca , showed that clusters with average mass measurements ( over lines of sight ) which are large tend to also have large mass scatter around their average , relatively high sphericity and small triaxiality , richness in the largest subgroup , and offset of the galaxy position average from the cluster center .",
    "relations were also seen for other quantities such as concentration , recent major merger time and fraction of halo mass near the cluster within a 3 @xmath6 plane .    finally , instead of considering each cluster individually , we considered the sample of all clusters and all lines of sight together , and found that most of the trends for the analysis of @xmath139 remained , albeit at different strengths .",
    "the projection on the direction of largest scatter was more weakly correlated with the observation angle relative to the cluster long axis .",
    "it is interesting to think about applying these methods directly to observation .",
    "one would need more information , in particular estimates of @xmath116 , rather than the opposite which we have here .",
    "this requires calibrations from simulations which better sample an expected observational sample at the high mass end , and which also include estimated masses from lower mass halos ( as well as faithfully reproducing the observational systematics and selection function ) .",
    "such a simulation would provide correlations and covariances and predicted likelihood masses @xmath140 ( and a variant , @xmath141 considered above , based on a narrow direction of scatter in our sample ) .",
    "pca could then be applied to @xmath142 or @xmath143 , rather than @xmath144 as we did here .",
    "it would be interesting to see if these pc vectors also had relations to cluster orientation such as we found , or perhaps other quantities such as @xmath145 .",
    "they might also give some idea of which follow up mass measurement methods would together provide the most constraining power .",
    "one could for example identify the measurement method with potentially the least covariance with measurements already in hand .",
    "more generally one could design a combination of measurement methods with smaller covariant scatter ( and hopefully smaller scatter as well ) using calculated pc vectors as a guide , if the simulations are faithful enough .",
    "it is a major challenge to accurately capture the systematics and selection function of observational surveys with numerical simulations .",
    "another technical issue is to improve estimates of the correlations and covariances , so that sets of inconsistent measurements can be more easily recognized",
    ". it would be very interesting to do such analyses on a larger box , and/or with other measurement methods .",
