    "after more than a decade of searching , the direct exoplanet imaging quest was finally successful in 2008 with the discovery of three planetary systems @xcite .",
    "one key advantage of this technique is the detection of the planet s thermal emission .",
    "detailed multi - band photometry and spectrometry can be acquired that can then be compared with atmospheric models to derive the planet s physical characteristics and study the effect of dust and molecular chemistry . with its multiple co - eval jovian planets ,",
    "the hr  8799 system is an ideal laboratory to study young planets with low temperature / surface gravity atmospheres and bridge the gap between massive field brown dwarfs and the cold solar system planets .",
    "hr  8799 is a 30myr old  @xcite a5v star located 39.4pc away @xcite in the pegasus constellation .",
    "it is classified as a  @xmath6 doradus and a @xmath7 bootis star  @xcite .",
    "it also shows an ir excess  ( vega - like star ) consistent with a debris disk composed of a warm dust disk  ( 6 to 15au ) , a massive cold dust disk  ( 90 up to 300au ) and a small dust particle halo extending up to a 1,000au @xcite .",
    "photometry and some spectroscopy of the hr  8799 planets are available in several bands from 1 to 3.8@xmath8 m  @xcite .",
    "an initial characterization @xcite has been achieved using the available data and state - of - the - art atmospheric models developed for field brown dwarf analysis .",
    "it is clear that these planets are quite different than most field brown dwarfs , showing very dusty atmospheres while being cool ( @xmath91,000k ) with no sign of methane molecular absorption . l- and",
    "m - band detections / upper limits suggest this lack of methane is due to a co / ch@xmath5 non - equilibrium chemistry @xcite .",
    "other teams have been able to fit the available photometry with patchy clouds and equilibrium chemistry atmospheres   @xcite .",
    "accurate m - band photometry can help disentangle the various models , but it is hard on a ground - based telescope due to the bright thermal background mainly from the telescope and the adaptive optics system  @xcite .",
    "this background is particularly hard to remove at keck , as it varies with time as the instrument image rotator ( which is located very near focus ) moves and as the ao deformable mirror modulates the rotator - induced background pattern as seen by the detector . as a result ,",
    "conventional sky / background subtraction routines leaves a spatially variable residual that limits final sensitivity .    in this letter , we present the first m - band ( @xmath10 m ) detections of three of the currently four known hr  8799 planets , the longest wavelength at which these planets have been imaged .",
    "the observations are discussed in   [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the data reduction along with the new very efficient loci - based ( loci : locally optimized combination of images ) background subtraction technique are presented in   [ sec : reduc ] .",
    "comparisons with field brown dwarfs and new atmospheric fits are shown in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] .",
    "conclusions are summarized in   [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the hr  8799 data was obtained on 2009 nov .  1 and 2 at the keck ii observatory using the adaptive optics system , the nirc2 near - infrared narrow field camera  @xcite and the m - band filter  ( @xmath11 m , @xmath12 m ) .",
    "no coronagraph was used for these observations .",
    "for these two nights , 140  unsaturated images  ( 58 for nov . 1 and  82 for nov .",
    "2 ) were acquired , each image consisting of 200 coadds of 0.3s , for a total on - source integration time of 140min .",
    "the data was taken in angular differential imaging mode  @xcite . in that mode , the instrument field rotator",
    "is adjusted to track the telescope pupil while leaving the field - of - view  ( fov ) to rotate with time .",
    "in addition , the telescope was nodded every few minutes between four positions to facilitate the background subtraction . in our data ,",
    "the total fov rotation is  @xmath13degrees for both nights , but both data sets were not acquired through transit ( between ha [ -1.6h,-0.4h ] and [ 0.6h,1.1h ] for nov .  1 and [ -1h,-0.6h ] and [ 0.5h,2.2h ] for nov .  2 ) .",
    "although such observing strategy is fine for background limited data , it did limit the amount of speckle subtraction achievable at smaller separations where the data is still speckle noise limited and where planet e is now known to be located ( the hr  8799 transit time was actually used during these two nights for l - band imaging to confirm planet e ) .",
    "the data reduction was performed as follows : we first subtract a dark image , divide by a flat field and mask bad / hot pixels .",
    "we then remove known nirc2 narrow - field camera distortions using the @xcite solution .",
    "the images are rotated by 0.252 degrees clockwise to put north up and the plate scale is selected to be @xmath14mas / pixel to be consistent with the distortion correction of @xcite .",
    "after these steps , we subtract the background  (  [ subsec : background ] ) and the speckle noise  (  [ subsec : spec ] ) on the two data cubes of 58  ( nov .  1 ) and 82 ( nov .",
    "2 ) images separately .",
    "we then average the two processed sets to produce a final image .",
    "the telescope was nodded between exposures to record the star at different detector locations . for each image of the sequence , a classical background reduction would consist of subtracting the median of all the images where the star is sufficiently dithered . this standard technique is limited because of the time variations of the thermal background whereas the median uses all the reference background images without distinction . as the background subtraction step is no different than a standard adi / loci speckle subtraction",
    ", we have developed a background subtraction routine  @xcite based on the locally optimized combination of images algorithm  ( loci , * ? ? ?",
    "this new routine is more efficient than the classical median subtraction as it puts different weights on the background reference images .",
    "consider the background subtraction in the  @xmath15th image  @xmath16 of the sequence .",
    "an annulus  ( called  @xmath17 , fig .  [ fig : f1 ] ) is defined around the star and all reference background images are selected where the star has been sufficiently dithered compared to @xmath16 .     where the background has to be subtracted  ( left ) and the  d region inside which the loci coefficients are optimized using the reference background dither images  ( right ) .",
    "_ _ ]    the algorithm searches for the linear combination of these images that minimizes  the @xmath18  ( i.e. the residual noise in  @xmath17 excluding bad pixels ) which can be expressed as @xmath19 ^ 2\\,d(x_j)\\ ] ] where  @xmath20 is the number of pixels in the image ,  @xmath21 is the total number of images in the sequence , @xmath22 is the @xmath23th pixel , @xmath24 is the  @xmath25th image of the sequence , and  @xmath26 the coefficients to be determined .",
    "the inner radius of area  @xmath17 is chosen to avoid the bright star speckle noise that can bias the background minimization algorithm , while its outer radius is chosen to avoid the dithered star images . in our case ,",
    "the inner and outer radii are 3 and 30@xmath27d corresponding to 24 to 240pixels .",
    "we have then imposed  @xmath28 if the star is at a similar location  in  @xmath24 as in  @xmath16 .",
    "the loci algorithm then finds the optimal  @xmath29  @xcite that minimizes  the  @xmath30 .",
    "the optimized background image  @xmath31 at each pixel for  @xmath16  ( not only in  @xmath17 ) is then @xmath32 the generated reference background image @xmath31 is finally subtracted from  @xmath16 . as  @xmath33 for the images where the star is registered at the same location in  @xmath24 as in  @xmath16",
    ", @xmath31 does not contain any flux from a possible companion . moreover , if a companion exists in  @xmath16 , its impact on the  @xmath29 loci coefficients is negligible since the companion flux is much smaller than the thermal background and  @xmath17 is large compared to the companion  psf .",
    "once the background is subtracted , we sub - pixel register each image using an iterative cross - correlation gaussian fit to the psf core  ( images are unsaturated ) .",
    "the speckle subtraction is performed following a basic  adi data reduction as described in  @xcite . for each data cube , an initial reference psf",
    "is assembled by taking the median of all images and is then subtracted .",
    "we then rotate the images to put north up and median combine them .",
    "we apply an unsharp mask to the resulting image  ( median in a  @xmath34d box ) to remove the low spatial frequency noise and convolve it by a  @xmath35/d width gaussian to average the high frequency pixel - to - pixel noise .",
    "we finally average the nov .  1 and 2 images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) .        without the  loci background subtraction ,",
    "none of the planets would have been detected ( right panel , signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for  d is less than  @xmath36 ) . with the  loci background subtraction , hr  8799b , c and d",
    "are detected  ( left panel , @xmath0 to @xmath37  snr ) .",
    "planet e non - detection is probably due to both sequences not being acquired through transit , thus limiting the amount of speckle noise being removed at small separations from the median subtraction .",
    "we tried to apply a more advanced loci algorithm  @xcite to improve the speckle reduction , but as the  fov rotation ranges were small for both nights , no contrast gain was achieved .",
    "planet fluxes and positions were obtained by subtracting the planets prior to the speckle reduction using the stellar unsaturated psf as the template .",
    "we also tried subtracting the companions prior to the loci - background algorithm and we have confirmed that no bias is introduced by this technique  ( final flux variations smaller than  @xmath38 ) .",
    "the subtraction was iterated by moving the planet template and changing its intensity until a minimal noise residual at the planet s location was achieved ( inside a 1.5  @xmath7/d radius area ; tab .",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] for the resulting magnitudes ) .",
    "photometric error bars were calculated in  @xmath39 width annulus .",
    "as expected from other wavelengths  @xcite , hr  8799b flux is roughly a third of that of planets  c and  d. the planet s positions are included in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the low snrs and the large m - band psf core result in large astrometric errors .",
    "a future astrometric hr  8799 paper using shorter wavelength astrometry is in preparation .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     contrast plots  ( central panel of  fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) were obtained by calculating the noise in an annulus having a @xmath27d width normalized by the stellar psf flux ( after performing the same unsharp mask and convolution of a 0.5 @xmath27d gaussian ) .",
    "the contrast plots were then normalized at each separation by the estimated point source throughput using simulated adi median process planets .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] shows that the loci background subtraction  ( black full line ) is up to  @xmath40 times better than a classical background median subtraction  ( red dotted line ) . if a classical background subtraction routine is used , an integration time of up to 9 times longer is required to reach the same loci background subtraction contrast .",
    "this new highly efficient loci - based background subtraction routine can be used on any data where the background is non - negligible and evolving with time .",
    "it has been shown that the hr  8799 planets are an l - type extension towards lower effective temperatures and lower surface gravities  @xcite .",
    "the planets have also been found to be dusty with evidence of non - equilibrium co / ch@xmath5 chemistry . if the hr  8799 planets are plotted in k-l vs l-m diagram  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] ) against field brown dwarfs and lower mass stars  @xcite , it is found that the hr  8799 planets are located near the l / t - type dwarf transition .",
    "the m - band photometry is thus consistent with what was found previously by other studies .        from the field",
    "brown dwarf best fit parameters of  fig .  4 - 6 of @xcite",
    ", we also find that the planet l- and m - band colors are consistent with dusty atmospheres with vertical mixing .",
    "@xcite found a similar result for  hr  8799b while considering lower surface gravities .",
    "if we compare our estimated m - band flux to  @xcite equilibrium chemistry model predictions , we find that all their best patchy - cloud atmospheric fits are rejected to  @xmath41 for  hr  8799b . for planets  c and  d , @xcite use equilibrium chemical models and focus on clouds to interpret the available photometry . the earlier work of  @xcite did compare different chemical models to their m - band upper limits for all three planets , but did not include near - ir photometry . our new photometry is consistent with some models proposed by the two teams and will help in constraining their fits .    in this letter , we compare cloudy and non - equilibrium model fits for all of the photometry for the three planets .",
    "such comparison has only been done for planet  b so far  @xcite .",
    "using the same solar abundance model atmosphere grids and procedures described in  @xcite , new gravities and effective temperatures are found ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] ) .        for planet  b ,",
    "we find similar model atmosphere parameters as in  @xcite , but with a slightly higher gravity ",
    "@xmath42 rather than  @xmath43 .",
    "this solar abundance model has @xmath44 and , thus , requires a very small radius ( @xmath45 ) to match the observed bolometric luminosity ; nearly a factor of  @xmath36 smaller than predicted by traditional hot - start models  @xcite . for planets  c and  d , we find temperatures and gravities that are fairly close to the expected values from evolution models  @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that increasing the metallicity to  @xmath46 times solar could bring the @xmath47 derived from atmosphere and evolution models for planet  b into better agreement .",
    "the photometry from this metal rich , evolution - consistent , model is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] .",
    "this model , however , predicts an m - band flux that is  @xmath48 brighter than observed  ( while all other bands agree to  @xmath49 or better ) .",
    "this may indicate an even higher overall metallicity and/or that a non - solar  c - to - o ratio is required .",
    "a broader exploration of the possible metal abundances for all four planets will be left to a future paper .",
    "in this letter , we have estimated for the first time the m - band fluxes of three of the currently four known hr  8799 planets .",
    "these detections were made possible due to the use of an innovative loci - based background subtraction routine that has allowed for a factor of  @xmath0 gain in contrast ( factor of  @xmath2 in integration time ) compared to a classical background subtraction using a median .",
    "this new background subtraction routine can be used to subtract the background noise in any infrared data .",
    "we have detected hr  8799b , c and  d at m - band from 3 to 8@xmath50 . from a k-l and l-m color diagram",
    ", we confirm that the three planets are located near the end of the l - type sequence , close to the l- and t - dwarf transition region .",
    "we then derived new atmosphere model fits for the three planets . for planets  c and  d ,",
    "temperatures and surface gravities are close to the expected values from evolutionary models . for planet  b , the solar abundance model fits well the broad band photometry from  @xmath51 to  @xmath52 m but it requires a very small planetary radius to match the bolometric luminosity and is thus in contradiction with the planet evolution models .",
    "the metal rich evolution - consistent model over - predicts the m - band flux , which may indicate an even higher overall metallicity and/or a non - solar c - to - o ratio .",
