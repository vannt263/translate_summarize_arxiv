    "the mean - field description of a many - body system , i.e. the hartree - fock ( hf ) and/or time - dependent hartree - fock theory ( tdhf ) , provides a simple tool for descriptions of certain aspects of complex quantum systems .",
    "however , it is well known that the mean - field approximation is suitable for the description of mean values of one - body observables , while quantum fluctuations of collective variables are severely underestimated .",
    "a second limitation of mean - field dynamics is that it can not describe spontaneous symmetry breaking during dynamical evolution .",
    "if certain symmetries are present in the initial state , these symmetries are preserved during the evolution .",
    "we have recently shown that a stochastic mean - field ( smf ) approach @xcite where the tdhf evolution is replaced by a set of mean - field evolution with properly chosen initial conditions .",
    "it will be shown that this approach can be a suitable tool to go beyond mean - field and describe the evolution of a system close to a quantum phase - transition @xcite . in a series of article",
    ", we applied the smf approach to describe transport properties in fusion reaction .",
    "transport coefficients related to dissipation and fluctuations have been obtained @xcite that are crucial to understand the physics of heavy - ion collisions around the coulomb barrier .",
    "a summary of recent results is presented .",
    "in a mean - field approach , the nuclear many - body dynamical problem is replaced by a system of particles interacting through a common self - consistent mean - field .",
    "then , the information on the system is contained in the one - body density matrix @xmath0 that evolves according to the so - called tdhf equation : @xmath1,\\rho ] , \\label{eq : puretdhf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2\\equiv \\partial { \\cal e}(\\rho ) /{\\partial \\rho}$ ] denotes the mean - field hamiltonian . while quite successful in the description of some aspects of nuclear structure and reactions @xcite , it is known to not properly describe fluctuations of one - body degrees of freedom , i.e. correlations .",
    "numerous approaches have been proposed either deterministic or stochastic to extended mean - field and describe fluctuations in collective space ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and reference therein ) . most often , these approaches are too complex to be applied in realistic situations with actual computational power .",
    "a second limitation of mean - field dynamics is that it can not describe spontaneous symmetry breaking during dynamical evolution .",
    "if certain symmetries are present in the initial state , these symmetries are preserved during the evolution @xcite .",
    "the stochastic mean - field ( smf ) has been recently shown to provide a suitable answer for the description of fluctuations as well as of the symmetry breaking process while keeping the attractive aspects of mean - field .",
    "let us assume that the aim is to improve the description of a system that , at the mean - field level and time @xmath3 , is described by a density of the form : @xmath4 ) or more generally an initial many - body density of the form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a normalization factor while @xmath7 are the creation / annihilation operators associated to the canonical basis @xmath8 .",
    "then , the mean - field evolution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : puretdhf ] ) reduces to the evolution of the set of single - particle states @xmath9 |\\varphi_i ( t ) \\rangle , \\label{eq : phitdhf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while keeping the occupation numbers constant .    in the smf approach , a set of initial one - body densities @xmath10",
    "is considered , where @xmath11 denotes a given initial density .",
    "the density matrix components @xmath12 are chosen in such a way that initially , the density obtained by averaging over different initial conditions identifies the density ( [ eq : densmf ] ) .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a convenient choice for the statistical properties of the initial sampling is @xmath13 where @xmath14 are mean - zero random gaussian numbers while @xmath15 the average is taken here on initial conditions . in this approach , each initial condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ini ] ) is evolved with its own mean - field independently from the other trajectories , i.e. @xmath16 |\\varphi^{\\lambda}_i ( t ) \\rangle , \\label{eq : puresmf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while keeping the density matrix components constant .",
    "therefore , the evolution along each trajectory is similar to standard mean - field propagation and can be implement with existing codes .",
    "a schematic illustration of the standard mean - field and stochastic mean - field is given in figure [ fig1:lacroix ] .",
    "the mean - field theory is a quantal approach and even if it usually underestimates fluctuations of collective observables in the nuclear physics context , these fluctuations are non - zero . within mean - field theory , the expectation value of an observable @xmath17 is obtained through @xmath18 where @xmath19 has the form ( [ eq : mbdensity ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the quantal average and fluctuations of a one - body observable @xmath20 along the mean - field trajectory are given by : @xmath21 and @xmath22    an important aspect of the smf approach is that the quantum expectation value is replaced by a classical statistical average over the initial conditions . denoting by @xmath23 the value of the observable at time @xmath24 for a given event",
    ", fluctuations are obtained using @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the statistical properties of initial conditions insures that quantal fluctuations [ @xmath27 and statistical [ @xmath28 fluctuations are equal at initial time .",
    "note that such a classical mapping is a known technique to simulate quantum objects and might even be exact in some cases @xcite .    in practice",
    ", it might be advantageous to select few collective degrees of freedom instead of the full one - body density matrix . at the mean - field level ,",
    "the evolution of a set of one - body observable @xmath29 is given by the ehrenfest theorem : @xmath30   \\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if a complete set of one - body observables is taken , for instance if we consider full set of operators@xmath31 , one recovers eq .",
    "( [ eq : puretdhf ] ) . in many situations",
    ", one might further reduce the evolution to a restricted set of relevant degrees of freedoms in such a way that the mean - field approximation leads to a closed set of equations between them , i.e. @xmath32 starting from this equation , one can also formulate the smf theory directly in the selected space of degrees of freedom by considering a set of initial conditions @xmath33 and by using directly the evolution : @xmath34 for each initial condition @xmath11 . note that statistical properties , i.e. first and second moments , of initial conditions should be computed using the conditions ( [ eq : mean ] ) and ( [ eq : fluc ] ) .",
    "in recent years , we have applied the smf approach either to schematic models or to realistic situations encountered in nuclear reactions where mean - field alone was unable to provide a suitable answer .",
    "some examples are briefly discussed below .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the mean - field theory alone can not break a symmetry by itself .",
    "the symmetry breaking can often be regarded as the presence of a saddle point in a collective space while the absence of symmetry breaking in mean - field just means that the system will stay at the top of the saddle if it is left here initially .",
    "such situation is well illustrated in the lipkin - meshkov - glick model .",
    "this model consists of @xmath35 particles distributed in two n - fold degenerated single - particle states separated by an energy @xmath36 .",
    "the associated hamiltonian is given by ( taking @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the interaction strength while @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath6 ) , are the quasi - spin operators defined as @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 and where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are creation operators associated with the upper and lower single - particle levels . in the following ,",
    "energies and times are given in @xmath36 and @xmath48 units respectively .",
    "it could be shown that the tdhf dynamic can be recast as a set of coupled equations between the expectation values of the quasi - spin operators @xmath49 ( for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath6 ) given by : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "note that , this equation of motion is nothing but a special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel ] ) where the information is contained in the three quasi - spin components . to illustrate the symmetry breaking in this model",
    "it is convenient to display the hartree - fock energy @xmath52 as a function of the @xmath53 component ( fig .",
    "[ fig2:lacroix ] ) .",
    "note that , here the order parameter @xmath54 is used for conveniency .",
    "when the strength parameter is larger than a critical value ( @xmath55 ) , the parity symmetry is broken in @xmath56 direction .     as a function of @xmath56 for @xmath57 ( dashed line ) , @xmath58 ( doted line ) and @xmath59 ( solid line ) for @xmath60 particles .",
    "the arrow indicates the initial condition used in the smf dynamics . ]    for @xmath55 , if the system is initially at the position indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig2:lacroix ] , with tdhf it will remain at this point , i.e. this initial condition is a stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdhf ] ) .    following the strategy discussed above",
    ", a smf approach can be directly formulated in collective space where initial random conditions for the spin components are taken . starting from the statistical properties ( [ eq :",
    "mean ] ) and ( [ eq : fluc ] ) , it could be shown that the quasi - spins should be initially sampled according to gaussian probabilities with first moments given by @xcite : @xmath61 and second moments determined by , @xmath62 while the @xmath6 component is a non fluctuating quantity .",

    "( adapted from @xcite ) ]    an illustration of the initial sampling ( top ) and of results obtained by averaging mean - field trajectories with different initial conditions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3:lacroix ] and compared to the exact dynamic . as we can see from the figure , while the original mean - field gives constant quasi - spins as a function of time",
    ", the smf approach greatly improves the dynamics and follows the exact evolution up to a certain time that depends on the interaction strength . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4:lacroix ] , the stochastic approach not only improves the description of the mean - value of one - body observables but also the fluctuations .     for three different values of @xmath64 , from top to bottom @xmath65 ( a ) ,",
    "@xmath58 ( b ) and @xmath66 ( c ) are shown . in each case ,",
    "solid , dashed and dotted lines correspond to @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . in each case , results of the smf simulations are shown with triangles ( @xmath70 ) , squares ( @xmath71 ) and circles ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "( taken from @xcite ) ]",
    "the smf has been recently used to deduce transport coefficients associated to momentum dissipation or mass transfer during reactions from a fully microscopic theory @xcite .",
    "the tdhf theory provides a powerful way to get insight nuclear reaction and treat various effects like deformation , nucleon transfer , fusion , ... in a quantal transport theory .",
    "an illustration of nuclear densities obtained at various time of the @xmath73ca + @xmath74zr reactions is given in fig .",
    "[ fig5:lacroix ] .    , are indicated by contour plots for the central collision of @xmath73ca + @xmath74zr system at @xmath75 mev in units of @xmath76 .",
    "the black dot is the center of mass point .",
    "the red lines indicate the positions of the window @xmath77 and @xmath78 denotes velocity of the window .",
    "( taken from @xcite ) ]    the mean - field approach does include the so - called one - body dissipation associated to the deformation of the system and/or to the exchange of particles .",
    "for instance , considering a set of observables , denoted generically @xmath79 , like the relative distance , relative momentum , angular momentum between nuclei or the number of nucleons inside one of the nucleus , it is possible to reduce the tdhf evolution and obtain classical equations of motion of the form : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an eventual driving force while @xmath82 corresponds to drift coefficients .",
    "for instance , the nucleus - nucleus interaction potential and energy loss associated to internal dissipation has been extracted in ref .",
    "@xcite using such formula .",
    "when tdhf is extended to incorporate initial fluctuations , the equation of motion itself becomes a stochastic process : @xmath83 for short time , the average drifts @xmath84 should identify with the tdhf one while the extra term is a random variables that leads to dispersion around the mean trajectory . in the markov limit , one can define the diffusion coefficient @xmath85    this mapping has been recently used to not only study dissipative process but also estimate fluctuations properties in the momentum and mass exchange . denoting by @xmath86 the diffusion coefficient associated with mass ,",
    "fluctuations in mass of the target and/or projectile can be computed using the simple formula @xmath87    in figure [ fig6:lacroix ] , an example of estimated variances during the asymmetric reaction @xmath73ca + @xmath74zr is shown as a function of time in the case of fusion reaction ( top ) or below the coulomb barrier ( middle and bottom panel ) .",
    "ca + @xmath74zr system at three different center - of - mass energies .",
    "the dotted lines denote total number of exchanged nucleons until a given time @xmath24 .",
    "( taken from @xcite ) ]    all cases correspond to central collisions .",
    "note that below the coulomb barrier the target and projectile re - separate after having exchanged few nucleons corresponding to transfer reactions .",
    "in general , it is observed that the fluctuations are greatly increased compared to the original tdhf and are compatible with the net number of exchanged nucleons from one nucleus to the other ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig6:lacroix ] ) .",
    "in this contribution , illustrations of the application of the stochastic mean - field theory are discussed .",
    "it is shown , that the introduction of initial fluctuations followed by a set of independent mean - field trajectories greatly improves the original mean - field picture .",
    "in particular , it seems that this approach is a powerful to increase the fluctuations that are generally strongly underestimated in tdhf or to describe the many - body dynamics close to a saddle point .",
