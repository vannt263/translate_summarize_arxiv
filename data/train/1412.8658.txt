    "classical cepheids are ideal standard candles since their pulsation periods and high luminosities are tightly correlated ( i.e. , the leavitt law , * ? ? ?",
    "they are also pertinent proxies of young stellar populations , and have been employed to delineate the milky way s spiral arms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "classical cepheids are by far the most valuable tracers of the galactic spiral structure , since their period - luminosity ( pl ) relations are robust and accurately calibrated , and allow the intrinsic computation of the interstellar extinction .",
    "furthermore , no putative assumptions of the galaxy s kinematics are required , and cepheids can be used to map regions along the galactic center and anticenter sightlines , where velocity - distance techniques fail . however ,",
    "extreme extinction endemic to the galactic disk has historically hampered the discovery of distant cepheids at low galactic latitudes in the 3rd and 4th galactic quadrants .",
    "pioneering near - infrared ( nir ) variability surveys of the inner galaxy , such as the irsf survey @xcite , capable of tackling the problem of high differential extinction , have only recently started to probe into these inner galactic regions .",
    "the situation has been substantially changed by the vista variables in the va lctea ( vvv ) survey @xcite .",
    "vvv is the only large nir time - domain photometric survey of the bulge and the southern galactic mid - plane .",
    "it has provided a @xmath8 atlas of about a billion point sources , and has been acquiring time - series photometry in the @xmath9 band since 2010 .",
    "vvv data present a historical opportunity for the census of distant classical cepheids in the galactic plane in the far side of the disk .    the vvv galactic cepheid program ( vgcp )",
    "is dedicated to discover and characterize distant cepheids in the 3rd and 4th galactic quadrants , concentrating on the detection young classical cepheids lying close to the galactic plane between @xmath10 and @xmath11 . due to the extreme reddening of @xmath12 ,",
    "the cepheids in this area are undetectable for all other existing and planned time - domain surveys . in the framework of the vgcp",
    ", we expect to detect hundreds of classical cepheids with distances up to the far edge of the galactic disk , thus extending their census to the complete southern milky way .",
    "these cepheids will be used to map the spiral arm structure in the far side of the milky way s disk .",
    "in addition to locating the spiral arms independently from other methods , they will also provide essential anchor points to velocity mapping surveys , supplying important constraints for the global kinematic properties of the galaxy .",
    "in this letter , we report the first results of the vgcp : the discovery of an intriguing close pair of classical cepheids located in the galactic plane in a distant spiral arm beyond the bulge , that have almost identical physical parameters and distances .",
    "in the framework of the vgcp , we are performing a massive and homogeneous photometric time - series analysis of point sources detected in the @xmath9-band vvv images .",
    "a complete in - depth analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper , here we only give a brief summary .",
    "our analysis is based on aperture photometry performed on single _ detector frame stacks _ ( a.k.a . `` _ pawprints _ '' ) provided by the vista data flow system ( vdfs , * ? ? ?",

    "the limiting @xmath9 magnitude is @xmath14  mag at small galactic latitudes , which is sufficient for detecting cepheids all the way through the galactic plane up to the far side of the disk , with interstellar reddening up to @xmath15  mag .",
    "our analysis includes the positional cross - matching of individual casu source catalogs , then a pre - selection of likely variable stars is performed on the assembled lcs based on various variability indices , and candidate variable objects ( @xmath16 of all sources ) are then subjected to period analysis . at the time of writing",
    ", we have analyzed the vvv @xmath9-band lcs of @xmath17 million point sources towards the central bulge in low - latitude fields ( @xmath18 deg ) .",
    "the lcs typically have @xmath19 epochs over @xmath20 years , with additional @xmath21@xmath22 epochs in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands .",
    "an initial search revealed a few hundred new distant cepheid candidates in the @xmath25@xmath26 day period range .",
    "a source of confusion in identifying these objects as classical cepheids is brought in by the presence of foreground type ii cepheids , i.e. , old , low - mass he - shell burning pulsating stars located in the bulge ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they have similar periods and unlike in the optical , nir lcs of cepheids do not allow for a clear distinction between the two types .",
    "therefore , in general , spectroscopic follow - up observations of the candidates are necessary for unambiguously verifying their nature , which is currently in progress by the vgcp team .    here",
    "we discuss an intriguing pair of objects discovered in our initial search for classical cepheid candidates , that we call the twin cepheids .",

    "we do not use the @xmath23-band magnitudes for this purpose because they are very close to the detection limit , and therefore have very large photometric errors .",
    "first , we compute the mean @xmath37 magnitudes of the stars from the optimized fourier fits of the lcs , and estimate their @xmath38 mean color indices using the @xmath9 magnitudes at the phases of the @xmath24-band measurements derived from the lc fit",
    ". then we compute the @xmath39 and @xmath40 mean absolute magnitudes from zero - point calibrated pl relations . from these quantities",
    "we calculate the color excess for each star by : @xmath41 an important advantage of using the @xmath24 and @xmath9 bands for this purpose is that variations in the @xmath42 color index of classical cepheids through their pulsation cycles are negligible ( @xmath43  mag ) independently of their periods ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , the @xmath38 of both stars are based on 3 @xmath24-band measurements taken at various different pulsation phases ( see fig .  [ lcs ] ) , therefore any bias in the color excess derived from eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) that is due to color variations ( @xmath44  mag for both stars ) should be less than @xmath45  mag .    the absolute @xmath46 extinction is determined by assuming the extinction curve found by @xcite . by transforming their absolute - to - selective extinction ratios from the 2mass to the vista system using the equations given by casu",
    ", we obtain : @xmath47 distances are computed by the following formula : @xmath48    the pl relations of classical and type ii cepheids are very different , and we use both in order to demonstrate that the twin cepheids must be of the first type . by assuming that they are type ii , and employing the pl relations of @xcite , we obtain a reddening value of @xmath49 , and a distance of @xmath50  kpc for both stars . at this distance ,",
    "the corresponding total reddening is unrealistically high when compared to the value of @xmath51 obtained from the reddening map of , which corresponds to the mean cumulative extinction up to the mean distance of bulge red clump stars in the @xmath52 angular radius of the twin cepheids .",
    "even if there was a very strong and very localized anomaly in the foreground reddening , we should see that the bulge red clump stars at small angular separations from the twin cepheids are similarly reddened , which is clearly not the case ( see sect .",
    "[ invoc ] ) .",
    "our conclusion is that both objects must be classical cepheids .    to calculate the true distances of the twin cepheids , we employ the classical cepheid pl relations of @xcite , by first transforming them from the 2mass bands into the vista bands using the transformation equations provided by casu , and then updating their zero - points to match the distance modulus of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) derived by @xcite using late - type eclipsing binaries .",
    "the resulting pl relations in the vista bands are as follows : @xmath53 \\times ( \\log p - 1 ) -5.617~[\\pm 0.048 ] \\\\",
    "m_{k_s } & = & -3.269~[\\pm 0.05 ] \\times ( \\log p - 1 ) -5.663~[\\pm 0.048]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the errors in the zero - points correspond to the total error in the distance modulus of the lmc .",
    "the resulting reddening values and distances are given in table  [ table ] .",
    "we note that the similarity of the reddenings under the type i and type ii assumptions is caused by the very similar intrinsic colors of these objects .",
    "we estimated the errors in the distances by monte carlo simulations , considering the errors in the @xmath24- and @xmath9-band vvv photometry and their zero - points , the mean magnitudes , the pl relations , the lmc distance modulus , and the @xcite reddening law , by adding gaussian random noise to these quantities with @xmath54 made equal to their quoted errors .",
    "the resulting purely statistical errors are @xmath55  pc and @xmath56  pc for c1 and c2 , respectively , which means an internal precision of @xmath0 . indeed ,",
    "the computed distances of the two stars differ by only @xmath57  pc .",
    "the systematic error is @xmath58  pc for both stars , meaning a total accuracy of @xmath59 in the distance determination .",
    "we note that we might underestimate the systematic error in case the variations in the extinction curve along the galactic plane exceed those found within the @xcite fields .",
    "our conclusion is that the twin cepheids are located at a common distance of @xmath60  kpc , and it would not be unexpected to find such young stars tracing a distant spiral arm . indeed , their positions coincide with the far 3 kpc arm detected earlier in co by @xcite . at their distance",
    ", their angular separation corresponds to only @xmath61  pc .",
    "they also lie extremely close to the true galactic plane , as expected for very young objects .",
    "in fact , by assuming a distance to the galactic center ( gc ) of @xmath62  kpc @xcite , and that the sun and the gc ( i.e. , sgr a * ) are located at @xmath63  pc and @xmath64  pc off the iau mid - plane , respectively @xcite , then the iau and the true galactic planes cross at the same distance ( to within the errors ) where the twin cepheids are located , meaning that they are exactly in the true galactic plane ( i.e. , less than @xmath4  pc from it ) .",
    "the fact that the twin cepheids form a very close pair and share both the same extinction and distance suggests that this is not a projection effect , but they are indeed close to each other .",
    "this is supported by the fact that they are almost coeval , as indicated by their very similar periods ( see sect .  [ twincep ] ) . since classical cepheids are relatively rare objects , the probability of finding such a close pair with such similar properties just by chance is virtually zero .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the twin cepheids indicate the presence of an underlying young open cluster in which they probably both still reside . even in a cluster the probability of finding two such remarkably similar stars is small , but their membership in a heretofore undetected cluster appears to be a much more palatable explanation than chance alignment of two field stars .    in order to attempt a direct detection of this `` invisible cluster '' , we analyzed the color - magnitude distribution of stars in the vicinity of the twin cepheids using a deep stack image from 24 best - seeing @xmath9-band mosaic images ( a.k.a .",
    "_ tiles _ ) provided by casu , using the swarp software @xcite . for the @xmath23 band",
    ", we used a stack of 3 tiles , and one tile in @xmath24 because the rest of the images had poorer seeing ( both cepheids are beyond the limiting magnitude in @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "we performed psf photometry using dophot @xcite in a @xmath67 field centered at @xmath6818:01:24.8 , @xmath69 - 22:54:36.4 ( mid - point in between the twin cepheids ) , and calibrated it into the vista system using vdfs aperture photometry .",
    "figure  [ cmds ] presents the nir cmds and color - color diagrams of the field .",
    "the cmd is complex , but contains the expected prominent features : a local main sequence and a reddened bulge red giant branch , while the most numerous disk and bulge dwarf mix at fainter magnitudes ( the unreddened bulge main sequence turnoff [ msto ] at a distance of @xmath70  kpc should have @xmath71  mag ) . a distant red giant clump that appears extended along the reddening vector between @xmath72 ,",
    "can also be observed in the @xmath73 cmd .",
    "in addition , there are a number of very red point - sources with @xmath74 mag at all @xmath9 magnitudes , that are probably even more distant and reddened stars than the twin cepheids .",
    "we evaluated the completeness of source detection by adding a few thousand artificial stars to the @xmath9 image in every magnitude bin and measuring the ratio of those successfully extracted by dophot under the constraint of their magnitudes being recovered within @xmath75 ( where @xmath54 is the photometric error ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath76 completeness curve is also shown in figure  [ cmds ] .",
    "mag ) diagrams of a @xmath67 area around the twin cepheids .",
    "mean @xmath9 photometric errors are shown with error bars .",
    "the cepheids positions are marked with _",
    "red points _ , the arrows show the @xcite reddening vectors . _ blue lines _",
    "denote basti isochrones that best fit the properties of the twin cepheids ( see text ) .",
    "the inset shows the @xmath77 completeness of @xmath9-band source detection . ]    in order to identify the expected locus of stars in the invisible cluster , we compared our cmds to the @xmath19-myr solar - composition canonical isochrone from the basti stellar evolution database @xcite , best matching the expected ages of the twin cepheids .",
    "this isochrone was shifted to match the derived distances and reddenings of the cepheids , and is shown as blue curves in fig .",
    "[ cmds ] .    neither the visual inspection of the cmds , nor that of the deep stack images reveal any point - source overdensity at the expected location of the invisible cluster .",
    "we also employed the procedure by @xcite and @xcite to search for any statistically significant overdensities . for this purpose , we used only sources selected in a vertical stripe around the isochrone on the @xmath78 color - magnitude space using @xmath79 .",
    "we detect a dense stellar structure at @xmath80 , @xmath81 , but with a significance of only @xmath82 , and both its position and significance change by small changes in the selection criteria .",
    "the failure of the direct detection of the invisible cluster can be expected if we consider that such a young cluster should have a very sparsely populated red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "since we are looking through the galactic bulge and plane in the cluster s direction , field stars with various reddenings and distances contaminate its rgb , easily washing out any potential weak overdensity . on the other hand , the cluster s msto , around which a higher density of cluster stars should be present ,",
    "is expected to be at @xmath83  mag , according to the basti isochrone .",
    "the detection of an overdensity in our data at this magnitude level is also unlikely because the completeness of source detection is only @xmath84 and quickly drops to a few per cent for fainter stars ( see fig .  [ cmds ] ) , and the expected locus of the cluster msto overlaps with the abundant sequence of highly reddened background red clump stars , which can also easily wash out any weak signal in the overdensity detection test .    at the same time , we can identify a few very red sources that are good cluster star candidates ( fig .  [ colorimg ] ) .",
    "finally , we note that because these two cepheids and their companions within the invisible cluster are expected to share the rotation of the galactic disk , their relative transversal motion velocity with respect to the sun should be approximately @xmath85 km / s , corresponding to a proper motion of @xmath86  mas / yr . we expect to measure this proper motion with the full vvv baseline in the next few years .",
    "as part of the ongoing vvv galactic cepheid program , we have presented the discovery of two heavily reddened ( @xmath87 mag ) and distant classical cepheids with almost identical properties . using nir pl relations , we find that they are located at the same distance of @xmath88  kpc , in the far 3 kpc arm beyond the bulge .",
    "their similarity and closeness suggest that they belong to the same young open cluster at ( @xmath89)= 6.9930 , + 0.0005 deg , that is disguised by source crowding and extinction .",
    "the discovery reported here is both the first detection of classical cepheids in the far side of the galactic plane , and the first ( indirect ) detection of an open cluster in the observational shadow of the bulge .",
    "our results also provide independent confirmation for the far 3 kpc arm .",
    "the current census of galactic classical cepheids is illustrated by figure  [ map ] .",
    "it has been historically confined to the close side of the galaxy , due to high interstellar extinction along the galactic plane .",
    "the only confirmed classical cepheids beyond the bulge were reported by @xcite , but they are far from the galactic plane , in the flared outer disk .",
    "the vvv survey is now enabling us to pierce through tens of magnitudes of optical interstellar extinction and extend the census of cepheids to the far side of the disk , with the ultimate goal of completing the face - on map of our galaxy .",
    "the twin cepheids also provide an important proof of concept for the vgcp , by demonstrating its capabilities of detecting distant and extremely reddened cepheids and measuring their distances with an excellent internal precision , and an accuracy better than @xmath90 ( dominated by the uncertainty in the extinction law ) . assuming the discovery of a few hundred classical cepheids by the vgcp",
    ", we expect that this accuracy will be sufficient for distinguishing between distant spiral arms up to the far edge of the disk , and also trace possible satellite galaxies that lie beyond it . mining these vvv cepheids warrants interesting results .",
    "days , respectively , cepheids in open clusters @xcite are marked with _",
    "red circles_. _ white crosses _ show the known classical cepheids in the nuclear bulge @xcite .",
    "the positions of the twin cepheids with their errors are indicated with orange points .",
    "the green lines denote the galactic latitudinal coverage of the vvv survey . ]",
