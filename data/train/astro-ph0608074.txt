    "ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) are a continuous particle flux arriving at the earth s atmosphere with strongly decreasing rate at highest energies . at energies above 10@xmath1  ev , their origin is expected to be extragalactic .",
    "however , even after several years of measurements , the major questions remain unanswered : where and how do these particles obtain such high energies and what is their elemental composition . for resolving the enigma about uhecr , experiments are designed for measuring the primary energy and type of cosmic rays as well as their arrival directions .",
    "entering the earth s atmosphere , cosmic rays initiate extensive air showers ( eas ) .",
    "the primary particle of an eas , which is the actual cosmic ray particle , interacts with a nucleus of air molecules .",
    "this hadronic interaction yields new secondary particles which will interact themselves with nuclei of air molecules .",
    "a growing cascade of secondary particles develops in the earth s atmosphere , which is called an extensive air shower . after an initial phase of particle multiplication",
    ", the number of charged particles in the shower falls due to energy losses . for inclined showers with moderate primary energy ,",
    "only some of the overwhelming amount of particles reaches the earth s surface .",
    "these particles can be observed by particle detectors at ground .",
    "for uhecr with nearly vertical incidence , the maximum of shower development is reached close to ground or even `` below '' ground .",
    "another detection technique arises from the energy losses of eas in the atmosphere .",
    "the energy deposited in the air excites molecules of the atmosphere where particularly the excitation of nitrogen molecules is of interest .",
    "the de - excitation of nitrogen molecules is partly proceeding through the channel of fluorescence emission .",
    "so a light track of the air shower in the uv - wavelength region between 300 and 400 nm can be detected by adequate telescopes .",
    "this enables a calorimetric measurement of the deposited energy of eas which can be used to obtain the primary energy of the cosmic ray .",
    "the pierre auger observatory is currently the only data - taking experiment for the detection of uhecr but still under construction .",
    "the first part nears completion in the pampa amarilla , near malarge , argentina  @xcite .",
    "the second part will be installed in colorado , usa . each site of the observatory is designed as a hybrid detector , which consist of particle detectors at ground and fluorescence telescopes .",
    "this configuration ensures at least in dark nights the possibility of simultaneous detection of air showers with two different detection techniques .    in may 2006 ,",
    "about 1100 of the total 1600 water cherenkov tanks , as particle detectors , have been deployed in the pampa .",
    "the spacing of the tanks is 1.5  km and finally an area of 3000  km@xmath2 will be covered . within these detectors , energetic electrons and muons induce flashes of cherenkov light which are recorded by three photomultipliers inside the water - filled tank .",
    "the duty cycle of this system is nearly 100  %  @xcite .",
    "the second detector component is fluorescence telescopes .",
    "four stations are located at the boundary of the surface array each consisting of six telescopes .",
    "a single telescope has a field of view of roughly 30@xmath3 with a minimum elevation of 1.5@xmath4 above horizon .",
    "each station in total has 180@xmath4 in azimuth observing the atmosphere above the surface array .",
    "the telescopes are built with a _",
    "optics with an uv - filter for reducing the background light .",
    "this system is operated during the one week before and after new moon at night .",
    "therefore , the duty cycle reaches only 15  % of the surface detectors .",
    "the camera in the focal point consists of 440 photomultipliers each covering 1.5@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "data taking started in january 2004 with a continuously increasing detector . until june 2005 ,",
    "an exposure of 1750 km@xmath2 sr yr could be achieved  @xcite .",
    "the development of extensive air showers in the atmosphere is strongly fluctuating from shower to shower .",
    "nevertheless , some systematic behavior is correlated with the energy and type of the primary particle .",
    "high - energetic shower penetrate deeper in the atmosphere than lower - energetic ones .",
    "vertical showers develop deeper in the atmosphere than more inclined ones . and",
    "also proton - induced air showers develop deeper than air showers induced by more heavy nuclei like iron .",
    "the shower development is described according to the amount of traversed air which is the _ atmospheric depth _",
    "@xmath5 given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 as geometrical height and @xmath8 as the altitude - dependent air density .",
    "as the density of air is quite low at higher altitudes , the height of first interaction is strongly fluctuating .",
    "the incoming particles represent the projectiles and the resting air nuclei are the target similar to the setup in fixed - target accelerator experiments . in the case of nuclei ,",
    "not all nucleons of the projectile interact with the target , most of them are only spectators  @xcite .",
    "in general , the description of eas can be divided into three particle components : the electromagnetic , muonic , and hadronic .",
    "if the incoming particle is a nucleus , high energy hadronic interactions produce mostly nucleons , charged and neutral pions , and kaons .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons have relatively long lifetimes of 10@xmath11  s , thus they can interact with air nuclei or decay depending on their energy @xcite . if the @xmath9 decay before interacting , they give rise to the muonic component accompanied by neutrinos : @xmath12 .",
    "many of the muons reach the earth s surface due to the relativistic time dilatation of their lifetime of 2.2 @xmath13  s and small energy loss .",
    "those which decay , produce parts of the electromagnetic component : @xmath14 .",
    "if the incoming particle is an electron or positron , energy loss due to bremsstrahlung is one of the most dominant processes .",
    "the emitted high - energetic photons create new pairs of electrons and positrons . in one radiation length ,",
    "their energy is attenuated by the factor @xmath15 , which is approximately the same as the @xmath15 attenuation of a gamma - ray beam due to pair production . in air ,",
    "the radiation length @xmath16 is about 37  g / cm@xmath2 .",
    "the particle multiplication is large and the electromagnetic component is the most numerous part in eas .",
    "this electromagnetic part of an air shower can also be induced by the decay of a @xmath18 into two photons  @xcite .",
    "losing more and more energy , these particles reach the critical energy which describes the equality of the energy loss due to radiation and the loss due to ionization .",
    "since ionization energy loss is about 2.2  mev / g / cm@xmath2 , the critical energy in air is 81  mev .",
    "the interplay of particle production and energy loss yields in a shower maximum and closer to ground the shower starts to die out .",
    "only some of the electrons and positrons reach the earth s surface .    the overall longitudinal shower development , as simulated with corsika @xcite , is shown in fig  [ fig : longidev ] , where a proton - induced shower with 10@xmath19  ev is plotted . on the left side , the development in terms of energy deposit of a vertical shower is displayed and on the right side , the particle number for a 45@xmath4 inclined shower .",

    "the energy deposit of an air shower is measured by the amount of emitted fluorescence light . however , integrating the whole energy deposit will not result in the total primary energy .",
    "the energy deposit is only that of the charged particles but the energy carried away by neutrinos is not detected .",

    "based on the data taken with the pierre auger observatory between january 2004 and july 2005 , a cosmic ray energy spectrum could be derived  @xcite . all events with zenith angle between 0@xmath4 and 60@xmath4",

    "the energy reconstruction of the surface array events would depend on air shower simulation with its considerable uncertainties arising from different hadronic interaction models .",
    "therefore , the energy is determined from the sub - sample of hybrid events .",
    "an energy conversion factor is derived by comparing the reconstructed energy of hybrid events , based on the calorimetric energy measurement with the fluorescence telescopes , with the surface detector signal at 1000  m from the shower core .",
    "finally , the exposure of the growing array is calculated .",
    "the estimated energy spectrum can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] together with previous measurements .",
    "statistics is still limited for the first data taking period and systematic uncertainties are quite large .",
