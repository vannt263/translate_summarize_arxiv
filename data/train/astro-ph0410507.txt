    "a few helium - rich white dwarfs at the cool end of the white dwarf sequence show evidence for metal lines in their spectra .",
    "since radiation forces are not strong enough to compete with gravity for temperatures below 40000  k it is expected that metals sink down on time scales which are short compared to the cooling age .",
    "if nevertheless metals are observed in the atmospheres , they must have come from outside the star .",
    "the most popular mechanism for this is accretion from interstellar matter .",
    "the observed metal abundances in helium - rich white dwarfs are in agreement with accretion in solar element proportions ( dupuis et al .",
    "1992 , 1993a , 1993b ) . however , the observed abundances of hydrogen are much too low to be compatible with the accretion rates inferred from metal accretion .",
    "the mechanism most widely discussed as reason for this `` hydrogen screening '' is the propeller mechanism adopted to white dwarfs by wesemael & truran ( 1982 ) : metals are accreted in the form of grains onto a slowly rotating , weakly magnetized ( 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2  g ) white dwarf , whereas ionized hydrogen is repelled at the alfvn radius .",
    "flux and circular polarization spectra of the white dwarfs gd40 and l745 - 46a were observed with the vlt - ut1 and pmos .",
    "grism 600r ( dispersion 1 / pix ) with order sorting filter gg435 was used resulting in a spectral range of about 52007300 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in the vicinity of h@xmath3 and the helium lines of gd40 amounts to 190 and 260 , respectively , and to 280 for h@xmath3 of l745 - 46a .",
    "the mean circular polarization in a spectral range between 5500  and 6800  amounts to 0.02% , and 0.03% for gd40 , and l745 - 46a , respectively , one order of magnitude lower than the expected values for kilogauss magnetic fields .",
    "according to the theory of line formation in a weak magnetic field the splitting of a spectral line is proportional to the mean longitudinal field @xmath4 .",
    "provided that the zeeman splitting of a spectral line is small compared to intrinsic ( thermal and pressure ) broadening ( e.g. angel & landstreet 1970 )  which is the case for white dwarfs and field strengths of up to about 10 kg  the amount of polarization can be determined by the weak - field approximation , which is valid even in the presence of instrumental broadening , but is not generally correct in the case of rotational broadening ( landstreet 1982 ) : @xmath5 with @xmath6 the effective land factor which equals 1 for hydrogen balmer lines ( e.g. bagnulo et al .",
    "2002 ) . for the hei line at 5875  @xmath6 = 1.16 ( leone et al .",
    "2000 ) .      in order to determine the mean longitudinal component of the magnetic field the observed circular polarization",
    "was compared to the predictions of the weak - field approximation in an interval of @xmath720  around h@xmath3 and the hei lines at 5875  and 6678 .",
    "the best - fit for @xmath4 , the only free parameter , was found by a @xmath8 minimization procedure ( see aznar cuadrado et al .",
    "2004 for details ) .",
    "minimum magnetic field strengths necessary for the propeller mechanism to work were calculated according to wesemael & truran ( 1982 ) .",
    "assuming a white dwarf mass of 0.6m@xmath9 , a radius of 0.013 r@xmath9 , an accretion rate of 10@xmath10 m@xmath9/yr the corresponding minimum magnetic field strengths from their eq .",
    "4a are 144000@xmath11  g and 3000@xmath7500  g for gd40 and l745 - 46a , respectively .",
    "the error accounts for a reading error of 1 mm in their fig .  1 .",
    "further errors are introduced by the stellar radius which enters the formula with third power and the accretion rate .",
    "the inspection of the individual polarization spectra of gd40 did not show any obvious features or variations in the polarization which can not be attributed to noise . for the h@xmath3 line the field strength and the respective 68.3%/99% confidence ranges from the weak - field approximation amount to ( 2747@xmath76892/15000)g and for the two hei lines at 5875  and 6678  to ( @xmath01683@xmath71528/3936 )  g and ( @xmath0716@xmath71848/4758 )  g , respectively .",
    "a fit to all three lines results in a magnetic field strength of 1131  g and a 99% confidence level of @xmath7 2973  g. for comparison the derived field strength for a field star amounts to @xmath0438@xmath7318/819  g ( 68.3%/99% confidence range ) .",
    "thus we conclude that gd40 does not posses a magnetic field with an upper limit of about 4000 g.",
    "the best - fit magnetic field strength predicted by the weak - field approximation for the spectral range of h@xmath3 is @xmath06900  g with 68.3% and 99% confidence ranges of @xmath72100  g and @xmath75550  g. although the field strength clearly exceeds the statistical 1@xmath12 error one has to be cautious , because the result solely depends on the vicinity of the h@xmath3 line .",
    "however , if this field could be confirmed , it would be strong enough to prevent hydrogen from accreting according to the prediction from the propeller mechanism of 3000  g.",
    "for l745 - 46a the predicted magnetic field strength from the weak field approximation amounts to @xmath06900  g with a formal 1@xmath12 error of 2100  g and a 99% statistical confidence range of @xmath75550  g. this magnetic field strength exceeds the minimum field strength of 3000  g necessary for the propeller mechanism to work .",
    "however , one should keep in mind , that this result is based on the h@xmath3 line only .",
    "if the detection is confirmed , this means for the first time an indication that magnetic fields may play a role in the accretion of hydrogen and metals onto cool helium - rich white dwarfs .",
    "however , we could not detect signatures of a magnetic field in the circular polarization or flux spectrum of gd40 .",
    "this does not necessarily mean , that no magnetic field is present , because if we are looking on the magnetic equator of a magnetic dipole ( @xmath13=90@xmath14 ) , the components of the magnetic field along the line of sight completely cancel and no circular polarization can be detected . according to wesemael & truran ( 1982 ) a field strength of about 144000  g is needed for gd40 to let the propeller mechanism work .",
    "if we now assume that we could detect a field strength of 4000  g ( derived upper limit field strength from the fit to all three lines with a confidence of 99% ) we could estimate an inclination angle of greater than 84@xmath14 for which the longitudinal field strength becomes to low to be detected ( brown et al .",
    "therefore the chance to miss a magnetic field of 144000  g is only about 6% . from our observations",
    "we must therefore conclude that in gd40 probably other mechanisms than magnetic fields prevent hydrogen from accreting .",
