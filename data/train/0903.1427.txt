    "bes - ii collaboration has reported a narrow threshold enhancement near @xmath18 in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath11 pairs from @xmath15 decays @xcite .",
    "the result of partial wave analysis ( pwa ) shows that if it is interpreted as a @xmath19 resonance , its mass is about @xmath20 , and its decay width is about @xmath21 at @xmath22 c.l .",
    "this observed enhancement has stimulated many theoretical studies of its underlying structure .",
    "some interpret it as a glueball candidate @xcite or a baryonium @xcite , and some others take into account the effect of the final state @xmath11 interactions @xcite .",
    "there will be some peculiar characters if it is interpreted as a glueball .",
    "for instance , it can couple to a pair of vector mesons @xmath2 , and the decay channel will be flavor independent , but we have not yet found such a narrow state in @xmath1 decays considering there has been a sizeable accumulation of events .    on the other hand , there exists an interesting phenomenon that may be related to the @xmath13 decay .",
    "we notice that in the process of @xmath0 radiative decays @xmath23 , where @xmath2 represent @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 and so on , the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution is dominated by the @xmath12 components in all of these channels @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these vector mesons generally have strong couplings with the nucleons and/or hyperons . as a result",
    ", we expect that the @xmath2 rescattering into @xmath11 could play an important role in the description of the pseudoscalar-@xmath11 coupling form factor in @xmath13 .",
    "this is also consistent with that the @xmath11 system has an important @xmath12 component .",
    "we list in tab .",
    "[ table1 ] some relatively significant channels of which the branching ratios are at the order of @xmath3 and which might contribute to the rescattering .",
    "it is worth noting that the experimental values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are extracted from @xmath29 , where the results greatly depend on the fitting methods @xcite .",
    "a similar problem is also with the data for @xmath30  @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the branching ratios displayed in table  [ table1 ] still have large uncertainties at the order of @xmath3 .",
    "however , we shall show later that the sizeable @xmath2 rescatterings into @xmath11 can not be neglected at all if the uncertainties were not more than one order of magnitude .",
    "for the purpose of exploring possibilities of reproducing the line shape of the threshold enhancement in @xmath13  @xcite , we can adopt such a set of values to determine the coupling constants and examine the model - dependent and independent aspects in this decay transition .",
    "bes - ii also reported another similar resonance observed in the @xmath31 invariant mass spectrum in @xmath32 , which has a mass @xmath33 and a width @xmath34 after a fit with a breit - wigner function @xcite .",
    "if these two experimental results can be attributed to the same resonance , it would be an additional evidence for the resonant property of this enhancement .",
    "but we should note that the present experimental data do not allow one to conclude whether @xmath35 is via quasi - two - body decay ( e.g. through @xmath36 ) or three - body decay . in order to understand the nature of the threshold enhancement in @xmath15",
    ", one should explore various possibilities in the transition mechanism .",
    "this forms our motivation in this work to study the role played by vector meson @xmath2 rescatterings in @xmath15 .    .branching ratios of @xmath37 , where @xmath12 represents a broad @xmath12 resonance with the mass @xmath38 and the decay width @xmath39 @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an interesting feature arising from the @xmath24 and @xmath25 rescatterings is that all of them contribute to @xmath11 significantly . note that these three amplitudes have absorptive part which can be determined in the on - shell approximation .",
    "we find that they individually overestimate the branching ratios for @xmath15 , and turn out to be much larger than the direct transitions .",
    "this phenomenon suggests that rescattering amplitudes of the intermediate @xmath40 , @xmath41 and a relatively smaller one @xmath42 should have a destructive interference to suppress the overall amplitude in order to be consistent with the experimental magnitude  @xcite . because of this constraint , we introduce two relative phases @xmath43 and @xmath44 between these amplitudes , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the direct and rescattering amplitudes , respectively .",
    "we note that the mesons in the loops are generally treated as fundamental fields with infinitely narrow widths in the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the relative phase angles are thus introduced to take into account the size effects arising from the meson propagators and interaction vertices as commonly adopted .",
    "since the contributions from the direct transitions are negligibly small , the relative phases are not sensitive to them and we do not discuss them in the following parts . in comparison with the data",
    "@xcite we find that the relative phases @xmath48 and @xmath49 leading to destructive interferences are favored .",
    "invariant mass spectrum of @xmath50 .",
    "the dashed , dotted , and dot - dashed lines correspond to contributions from @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53-rescattering , respectively .",
    "the solid line is the overall interference with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath49 .",
    "the lower and upper bound of the shadowed area correspond to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the triangle with error bar represents the experimental data from ref .",
    "in fig .  [ fig2 ] , we plot the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath11 for the rescattering transitions , i.e. @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the coherent results are shown by the solid curve , with @xmath58 , and a bound given by @xmath59 gev .",
    "it shows that the contributions from the @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 rescatterings are much larger than their coherent sum .",
    "nevertheless , at large value of @xmath60 , these contributions have different behaviors .",
    "it is interesting to see the consequence of the interferences among these amplitudes which produces the enhancement at low @xmath60 and flattened cross sections at large @xmath60 .",
    "there are essential points which should be clarified here :    \\i ) the @xmath2 rescattering mechanism can be recognized as a dynamical account of the energy - dependent @xmath61 form factors .",
    "\\ii ) we emphasize again that such a prescription is based on the experimental evidence for the dominant @xmath19 partial wave for @xmath2 in @xmath62 , and significantly large @xmath63 couplings .",
    "therefore , we can expect to gain much better insights into @xmath15 reaction mechanism , in particular , for the @xmath19 partial wave in the @xmath11 spectrum .",
    "\\iii ) the large cross sections given by intermediate @xmath2 rescatterings imply that there must exist destructive phases among those amplitudes for which phase angles @xmath64 and @xmath65 are introduced for the dominant transition amplitudes .",
    "this feature can be regarded as less model - dependent since large contributions from the @xmath2 rescatterings seem to be inevitable .",
    "we shall investigate this in @xmath11 annihilation later to show that the @xmath2 rescatterings have not been overestimated .",
    "in contrast , we note that the behavior of the cancellations would be model - dependent .",
    "the phase angles are determined in such a way that the cancellations is required to produce the threshold enhancement in the @xmath11 spectrum . however , for the purpose of exploring possibilities of producing the threshold enhancement in @xmath11 spectrum , such a requirement can be justified .",
    "\\iv ) we note that the data in ref .",
    "@xcite do not contain sufficient background estimate as emphasized by bes  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the data contain contaminations from @xmath66 , and the detector efficiency ( de ) has not been corrected .",
    "this will affect the determination of @xmath67 which requires a better understanding of those pieces of information .",
    "as shown by the dotted curve in fig .",
    "3(a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the de exhibits an overall flattened shape though it is slightly better at small @xmath11 invariant masses .",
    "because of this , a shadowed area corresponding to @xmath59 gev is shown in fig .",
    "we can also see that the de correction and background subtraction will not change the shape of the enhancement drastically .",
    "as follows , we come to the key issue to investigate the @xmath69 as an independent check of the @xmath2 rescattering mechanism .",
    "there are experimental data for @xmath11 annihilations into vector meson pairs  @xcite . by adopting the same couplings used in @xmath15 via @xmath2 rescatterings",
    ", we can calculate the cross sections for @xmath68 and then check whether the @xmath2-rescattering contributions have been overestimated or not .",
    "the branching ratios for the @xmath25 and @xmath70 final state in @xmath11 annihilations at rest were measured , @xmath71 @xcite and @xmath72 @xcite . however , the total cross sections with @xmath73 and @xmath74 at rest are not available .",
    "we then adopt the total cross section , @xmath75 with @xmath76 for the incoming antiproton beam to estimate the @xmath25 and @xmath70 production cross sections .",
    "it gives @xmath77 for @xmath11 with low relative momenta , the cross sections should be dominated by the relative @xmath78 wave , i.e. the orbital angular momentum between @xmath73 and @xmath74 is zero .",
    "furthermore , the configuration of @xmath79 will have @xmath80 .",
    "thus , it will be suppressed due to @xmath81-parity violation when it couples to @xmath25 and @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath78-wave decay will then occur via the @xmath82 configuration , and the cross section can be estimated by using the following projector for the @xmath11 system @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 .    with the same effective lagrangians , form factors and coupling constants as in @xmath15 , and with the cut - off energy @xmath85 , we obtain the following cross sections : @xmath86 which are consistent with the data within both experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this suggests that our @xmath2 rescattering contributions have not been overestimated .",
    "we note that the full calculation without imposing the @xmath82 projector gives similar results near threshold which confirms the @xmath78-wave dominance .",
    "we can further understand the @xmath2 rescattering mechanism by looking at the @xmath16 .",
    "the reaction can be illustrated by feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "the @xmath82 configuration is also dominant near threshold , i.e. an @xmath78-wave decay amplitude . again , with the same effective lagrangians , form factors and couplings , we find a quick increase of the cross sections at small values of @xmath60 as shown in fig .",
    "it helps clarify that the intermediate @xmath2 rescatterings can contribute to the threshold enhancement in the @xmath11 invariant spectrum in @xmath15 .    .",
    "]     with @xmath11 in the @xmath87 state . ]",
    "further search for this threshold enhancement was carried out in @xmath17 at bes  @xcite , where it was claimed that the @xmath11 enhancement was absent as shown by the data in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . however , haidenbauer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggest that there still exist a similar threshold enhancement due to final state @xmath11 interaction except that it is much less significant due to kinematic changes and competing hadronic background .",
    "we also extend our formalism to @xmath88 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath89 by bes @xcite allows us to estimate , @xmath90 with which the coupling constant is extracted as @xmath91 with the other parameters fixed the same as in @xmath92 , we plot the @xmath11 invariant mass distribution for @xmath88 in fig .",
    "again , it shows that the rescattering terms overestimate the cross sections at low @xmath60 , while the interference gives much smaller cross section .",
    "we do not try to quantitatively describe the data at large invariant masses since they are the kinematics that other partial waves and mechanisms would become important .",
    "it should be noted that our estimate of the @xmath93 decay is rather rough , and a better measurement of @xmath94 and @xmath95 will provide a better constraint on our model .",
    "however , this does not prevent us from gaining some insights into the @xmath11 threshold enhancement due to final state interactions .",
    "it is essential to recognize that the rescattering transitions via @xmath2 could be much larger than the direct transitions based on the available experimental evidence  @xcite and the significant absorptive contributions from the @xmath2 rescatterings .",
    "this can be regarded as a peculiar property of some of those @xmath96 off - shell couplings .",
    "additional experimental information from @xmath11 annihilations seems to confirm such a dynamics .",
    "although the determination of the relative phases depends on the requirement of cancellations among the dominant amplitudes , we emphasize that the presence of the threshold enhancement is mainly due to the property of @xmath16 transitions .",
    "it is of great importance to recognize that the same mechanism may behave differently in different channels due to kinematic and interferences from other processes .",
    "therefore , it may not appear prominently everywhere .",
    "because of this , it appears to be an attractive solution for our understanding of the @xmath92 and @xmath93 results .",
    "as studied in the literature  @xcite that @xmath11 final state interaction can also produce threshold enhancement , it is urged to have a systematic understanding of how these mechanisms exhibit and interfere with each other .",
    "we expect that the bes - iii experiment in the near future would provide a great opportunity to clarify the underlying dynamics of the @xmath11 threshold enhancement  @xcite .",
