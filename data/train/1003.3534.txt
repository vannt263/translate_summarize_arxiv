    "graphs provide a mathematical model in many scientific areas , from physics ( magnetization properties of metals , evolution of gases ) to biology ( neural networks , disease spreading ) and sociology ( social networks , opinion spreading ) .",
    "individuals ( atoms , molecules , neurons , animals ) are identified with vertices and an edge drawn between two vertices identifies a relation as proximity or existence of some sort of contact . when a part or the totality of the edges are subject to some randomness , it is natural to deal with random graphs ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "one can construct a random graph starting from a deterministic graph either by adding random connections , or by removing some connections randomly , as in percolation . a particular class of random graphs of the first type",
    "are _ small world graphs _ , constructed starting from a @xmath0-dimensional ( discrete ) torus , whose edges are called _ short range connections _ , adding some random connections , called _ long range connections_.    bollobas and chung @xcite first noted that adding a random matching in a cycle ( i.e. @xmath4 ) , the average distance between sites is considerably smaller than on the deterministic graph .",
    "watts and strogatz @xcite introduced , as a model for biological applications , the random graph obtained in @xmath4 with each site connected to the ones at euclidean distance smaller than @xmath12 and long range connections constructed by taking the deterministic ones and by moving with probability @xmath13 one of the end sites to a new one chosen at random .",
    "another possible construction was introduced by newmann and watts @xcite : they took the same deterministic short range connections of watts and strogatz , but they added a density @xmath13 of long range connections between randomly chosen sites .",
    "average distance between sites and clustering coefficient of small world graphs have been well investigated ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "see @xcite for a historical introduction of small world graphs and main results .",
    "recently some authors have been focusing on processes taking place on random graphs .",
    "durrett and jung @xcite have studied the contact process on the small world . their version of the small world ( which is also the one we study in the present work ) is a generalization of the bollobas - chung model : they take the @xmath0-dimensional torus @xmath14 with short range connections between each pair of vertices at euclidean distance smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "the long range connections are drawn choosing at random a partition of the @xmath15 vertices in pairs and connecting each pair of the partition ( see section [ bcsw ] for more details about the construction ) .",
    "note that all sites have exactly one long range neighbour , which may coincide with a short range one . nevertheless with large probability",
    "most of the sites have a true long range neighbour , and we choose a random walk which makes the small world `` stochastically homogeneous '' ( see the definition of the transition matrix @xmath16 in section  [ bcsw ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of such a costruction is that we can associate to the random graph a non - random translation invariant graph @xmath17 , called _",
    "big world_. to get an idea of how the big world looks like , see figure 1 .",
    "one starts with a copy of @xmath18 and then attaches to each site an edge joining this site to another copy of @xmath18 and proceeds by ( infinite ) iteration .",
    "this edge represents the long range connection ( thus for instance in dimension 1 , if the long range neighbour of 0 is 3 , then 3 is represented in the big world by the site three steps away from 0 in the first copy of @xmath19 , but also by the site at the endpoint of the `` long range '' edge attached to 0  and indeed by many other sites ) . for more details on this deterministic graph and on its relationship with the small world see @xcite where the big world was first introduced and section [ bigworld ] .",
    "one expects that if the distance between sites plays an important role ( as for random walks , coalescing random walk or the contact process ) , a process taking place on a small world will behave differently from the same one on the torus .",
    "we consider random walks on the small world and , under some assumptions on the starting sites , we study the asymptotic behaviour of three sequences of random times : the time @xmath20 after which a single random walk first hits the origin , the time @xmath2 after which two random walks first meet and the coalescing time @xmath21 of a coalescing random walk starting from a fixed number of particles . recall that the coalescing random walk on a graph is a markov process in which @xmath22 particles perform independent random walks subject to the rule that when one particle jumps onto an already occupied site , the two particles coalesce to one .",
    "the time when we first have only one particle left is called _ coalescing time_.    it is natural to compare our results with the corresponding results on the torus : for the simple symmetric continuous time random walk on the @xmath0-dimensional torus , cox ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) proved ( under some assumptions on the initial position ) that for @xmath23 @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , and for @xmath8 , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 equal to the expected number of visits to the origin of a discrete time simple symmetric random walk , converge to an exponential of mean 1 .",
    "one can also get the same result for the random walk starting from the stationary distribution ( this was proved in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.1 ) in discrete time ) as a corollary .",
    "cox and durrett ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) ) proved a result in the @xmath28-dimensional case under more general conditions on the starting point and on the transition matrix for a discrete time random walk .",
    "the case @xmath4 is slightly different : flatto , odlyzko and wales ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) proved that for the discrete time random walk starting from the uniform distribution @xmath29 converges to a certain law .",
    "it is possible to show that these results also hold in continuous time .",
    "note that , by the symmetry of the walks on the torus , it is easy to show that the meeting time @xmath30 of two independent random walks @xmath31 and @xmath32 on the torus , conditioned to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , coincides with the law of @xmath35 conditioned to the starting point @xmath36 . therefore from theorems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) , ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) one easily deduces the asymptotic behaviors of the meeting time of two particles .",
    "since a small world is a random graph , studying random walks on it we have two sources of randomness : the graph and the walk .",
    "we denote by @xmath37 the random variable whose possible values are the small worlds of size @xmath38 and by @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 if we need to stress the dependence on @xmath38 ) one of the possible realizations of @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath41 is the transition matrix of an adapted ( i.e. transition from @xmath42 to @xmath43 may occur only if they are connected by an edge ) and translation invariant symmetric random walk on @xmath44 and @xmath45 , once a small world @xmath39 is fixed , the random walk we consider on it moves according to @xmath41 with probability @xmath46 and moves along the long range connection with probability @xmath47 .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the uniform probability on all the small worlds ; given a small world @xmath39 , we denote by @xmath49 the joint law of two independent continuous time random walks starting from the probability distributions @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "by @xmath52 ( with no pedex ) we denote the average over all small worlds ( see section [ bcsw ] for the formal definitions ) .",
    "we look for results for each graph @xmath39 in a set of large @xmath48-probability (  _ quenched _ \" point of view ",

    "durrett ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter @xmath53 ) proved , for a large class of random graphs with @xmath54 vertices , that for each sequence @xmath55 of small worlds chosen in sets of large @xmath48-probability , if @xmath56 is the meeting time of two particles starting from the stationary distribution , then @xmath57 ( for some @xmath58 ) converges to the exponential distribution .",
    "in particular such a result holds for the small worlds we consider in dimension one ( clearly with @xmath59 ) .    with different techniques we prove more accurate results in dimension @xmath0 .",
    "we suppose that the two random walks start respectively from the origin 0 and from a site @xmath60 and we prove convergence to an exponential law of @xmath61 , under the assumption that either @xmath62 is constant or moves towards infinity at a sufficiently large speed ( bear in mind that on @xmath39 there are two distances between two sites @xmath42 and @xmath43 : the euclidean one @xmath63 and the - random - graph distance @xmath64 ) .",
    "moreover we identify the constant @xmath27 , which is a fundamental tool to compare our results with the corresponding ones on the torus in @xmath8 .",
    "recall that there exists a deterministic graph called big world @xmath65 which can be mapped onto the small world . through the inverse of this map ( see section [ bigworld ] for details ) we associate to each site @xmath66 a unique site @xmath67 in @xmath65 , and to a random walk on the small world we associate a random walk on @xmath65 , whose law is denoted by @xmath68 .",
    "we denote by @xmath69 the expected time spent at site @xmath70 by the random walk at speed 2 starting from @xmath67 on @xmath65 , namely @xmath71 note that such constants depend on the probability @xmath47 .",

    "for all @xmath82 @xmath85    [ th : main ]    the main tools in the proof of this result are : the use of the laplace transform ( much in the footsteps of @xcite ) ; the fact that with large @xmath48-probability a large ( but not too large ) neighbourhood of a fixed vertex looks like the big world and the fact that for very large times the random walker is approximately uniformly distributed on the graph . we prove theorem [ th : main ] for continuous time",
    "random walks , but for discrete time random walks ( which we denote by @xmath86 ) the same arguments lead to the corresponding result .",
    "the only difference is that instead of @xmath69 one has the expected number of visits at even times @xmath87 moreover , by a similar argument one proves the result for the hitting time to the origin ( see theorem [ th:1walk ] ) . as a corollary one can get the law of the meeting time of two random walks and the law of the hitting time to the origin of a single walker starting from the uniform distribution .",

    "thus two particles meet faster on the small world than on the torus if @xmath47 is small , but meet faster on the torus if @xmath47 is large .",
    "this means that where the limiting space @xmath18 is transient ( @xmath8 ) , a small probability of taking a connection towards a distant site ( the long range neighbour ) makes it easier to meet , but if this probability is too large then it is easier for the two walkers to get lost instead of meeting . unfortunately identifying the value of @xmath47",
    "at which the inequality between @xmath90 and @xmath101 reverses seems a difficult task , which goes beyond the aim of this paper .",
    "one strategy could be try to find numerical approximations of the two constants by evaluating with a combinatorial procedure the @xmath22-step return probabilities on @xmath18 up to time @xmath107 and substituting in this evaluation up to step @xmath107 and the asymptotic value of the return probabilities ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 13.10 ) ) for @xmath108 .",
    "of course this has to be repeated for a large set of values of @xmath47 and one also needs to tackle the question of how large @xmath107 needs to be in order to make the error small .",
