    "the low - temperature properties of many u- and ce - based intermetallic compounds are well described by fermi - liquid state  @xcite . here , the specific heat @xmath12 and the electrical resistivity @xmath13 as a function of temperature @xmath14 vary as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath2 and @xmath1 are constant .",
    "the coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath1 are related to the electron effective mass @xmath17 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath6 therefore does not depend on @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , kadowaki and woods showed that many u- and ce - based compounds show a universal relation , @xmath6 = 1.0@xmath710@xmath10 @xmath20 cm ( mol@xmath21k / mj)@xmath22  @xcite . furthermore , this relation has proved to be applicable to @xmath23-electron systems with large @xmath2 , for example , a15-type intermetallics like v@xmath4si  @xcite , nearly - ferromagnetic itinerant - electron systems like yco@xmath24  @xcite , and metallic oxides close to metal - insulator transition like v@xmath24o@xmath4 under high pressure  @xcite and liv@xmath24o@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "these observations demonstrate that the fermi - liquid state is a general feature for a wide range of correlated - electron systems .",
    "large @xmath2 has also been reported in a number of yb - based intermetallics  @xcite .",
    "one can naturally expects that the kadowaki - woods relation , @xmath6 = 1.0@xmath25@xmath20 cm ( mol@xmath21k / mj)@xmath22 , also holds for these yb compounds . in several yb - based compounds , however ,",
    "the @xmath6 values have been reported to be remarkably smaller than that of the kadowaki - woods relation . for ybcu@xmath3ag",
    "@xcite and ybcu@xmath26ag@xmath27  @xcite , the @xmath6 values are 0.1 - 0.6@xmath28@xmath20cm(mol@xmath21k / mj)@xmath22 , nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than that for the kadowaki - woods relation .",
    "it is also reported that the @xmath6 for ybcu@xmath29  @xcite and ybni@xmath24ge@xmath24  @xcite is close to this value .",
    "in addition , this value well coincides with the ratio for the transition metals such as re , os , ni , and so on  @xcite .",
    "this deviation of @xmath6 value from the kadowaki - woods relation can pose quite an interesting subject to the fermi - liquid theory , if it is a general phenomena for a class of materials .",
    "however , there have been no systematic studies on the @xmath6 values for yb - based compounds .",
    "we have therefore investigated the @xmath6 relation in several yb - based compounds .",
    "we have measured the electrical resistivity of the yb - based compounds , ybal@xmath24 , ybinau@xmath24 , ybincu@xmath3 , and ybcual .",
    "these systems are typical examples of yb - based intermediate - valent or heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "we also have examined the @xmath6 values for several other compounds using the values reported in literature .",
    "polycrystalline samples of ybal@xmath24 and ybcual have been prepared by argon arc melting and subsequent annealing . to compensate the loss of yb due to evaporation ,",
    "slightly additional amount of yb was used in synthesis .",
    "polycrystalline sample of ybinau@xmath24 was prepared by melting the elements in a bn crucible placed in an evacuated silica tube , and slow cooling . for ybincu@xmath3 ,",
    "a single crystal sample was prepared by an in - cu flux technique  @xcite .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction shows that single phased samples were obtained for all the compounds .",
    "electrical resistivity was measured by a standard dc four probe technique in the temperature range between 4.2 and 300 k.",
    "figure 1 shows the electrical resistivity @xmath13 as a function of temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the residual resistivity @xmath30 of these samples are almost the same as or smaller than those reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 of ybincu@xmath3 decreases abruptly at 40 k due to the valence transition of yb  @xcite .",
    "the sharp transition indicates that our crystal is well ordered  @xcite .",
    "ybcual shows relatively rapid decrease below approximately 20 k. this temperature roughly corresponds to the characteristic temperature @xmath31 , below which the coherence between kondo singlets develops and the system enters the fermi liquid regime  @xcite . for ybinau@xmath24 , @xmath31 is of the order of 70 k. for ybal@xmath24 , @xmath13 does not show a distinct temperature dependence up to 300 k. this indicates that @xmath31 of ybal@xmath24 is above the room temperature .    in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath32 are plotted as a function of @xmath0 . for ybcual , ybinau@xmath24 , and ybal@xmath24 ,",
    "@xmath32 is described by the @xmath0 power law at low temperatures , indicating the evolution of fermi - liquid state . for ybincu@xmath3",
    ", @xmath32 deviates from the @xmath0 dependence above 20 k , and the data up to 30 k are well fitted with the correction of @xmath33 dependence , as is shown in fig . 2 ( b ) .",
    "this suggests that the conventional electron - phonon scattering is important in ybincu@xmath3 .",
    "the values of the @xmath0 coefficient @xmath1 have been obtained by fitting the data at low temperatures , and are listed in table 1 . in these @xmath1 values ,",
    "errors of the order of 20% can exist due to the inaccuracy in estimating the sample dimension . for ybal@xmath24 and ybincu@xmath3 , however , the error in @xmath1 can be much larger because of the small value of @xmath1 and the presence of the @xmath33 term .",
    "the @xmath1 values are plotted against @xmath2 on the kadowaki - woods plot  @xcite , as is shown in fig .",
    "we also plot @xmath1 and @xmath2 values of several systems reported in literatures .",
    "the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are listed in table 1 .    in fig .",
    "3 , one can see that the kadowaki - woods relation , @xmath6 = 1.0@xmath710@xmath10 @xmath20cm(mol@xmath21k / mj)@xmath22 , is almost preserved for ybni@xmath24b@xmath24c , ybrh@xmath24si@xmath24 , yb@xmath24co@xmath4ga@xmath34 , ceni , and ybinau@xmath24 . on the other hand , it is apparent that several systems show a significant deviation from the relation . in particular , there appears to exist another universal relation ; @xmath35 cm ( mol@xmath21k / mj)@xmath36 , for ybcu@xmath26ag@xmath27 , ybcu@xmath29 , ybcual , ybni@xmath24ge@xmath24 , ybal@xmath4 , ybincu@xmath3 , ybcu@xmath3al , ceni@xmath34si@xmath3 and cesn@xmath4 .",
    "extrapolation of this line well coincides with the @xmath6 value for the transition metals such as pd or re  @xcite . as for ybal@xmath24 and ybcu@xmath24si@xmath24",
    ", the @xmath6 ratio appears to be situated between the two lines .",
    "we have shown in the preceding section that many yb - based and several ce - based compounds show nearly two times smaller values of @xmath6 than that for the kadowaki - woods relation . in this section ,",
    "we discuss on the possible origin of the deviation from the kadowaki - woods relation .    at first",
    ", it must be remarked that the @xmath1 value depends not only on @xmath37 but also on many factors , including anisotropy , carrier concentration , fermi - surface topology , band structures , and site disorder . in particular",
    ", the effect of site disorder may be important as is pointed by several authors , since the effect can suppress @xmath1 through the kondo - hole effect  @xcite . here",
    ", the site disorder gives the additional resistivity : @xmath38 = @xmath39  @xcite , which results in the reduced @xmath0 coefficient of @xmath40 .",
    "however , although this mechanism may be important in some systems , it is unlikely that the kondo - hole effect can explain all the small @xmath6 values , especially almost universal value , @xmath6 = 0.4@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "kondo - hole effect should result in a random distribution of the @xmath6 values .",
    "moreover , the additional term , @xmath38 = @xmath39 , has been observed in only limited systems , such as ybinau@xmath24 under high pressures  @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe that the kondo - hole effect is not the crucial origin for most of the small @xmath6 values . as for the other effect such as carrier concentration or band structures , although these effect must be taken into consideration , it is unlikely that these effect can explain the smaller universal relation .",
    "we next consider this phenomenon relating with the three mechanisms ; ( i ) single - body band effect , ( ii ) intersite magnetic correlation , and ( iii ) the ground state degeneracy .",
    "et al . _ have considered theoretically the effect of many - body correlations in heavy - fermion systems , where conduction electrons have a strong frequency - dependence in its self energy .",
    "they have suggested that the many - body effect can enhance the @xmath6 value by about 25 times larger than the case of single - body band , and this would explain the 25 times different @xmath6 between the transition metals and the heavy - fermion systems  @xcite",
    ".    similar argument may be applicable for ybal@xmath24 , of which @xmath2 is relatively small . in this compound",
    ", the many - body and the single - body effects can be comparable , which may reduce the @xmath6 to the same order as that in transition metals .",
    "on the other hand , for ybcual , ybcu@xmath3ag , ybcu@xmath5 or ceni@xmath34si@xmath3 , these systems exhibit much larger @xmath2 ( 100 - 600 mj / molk@xmath22 ) than those of transition metals .",
    "this indicates that dos of the conduction band is enhanced through the many - body effect , i.e. , the kondo - lattice formation .",
    "even in ybal@xmath4 , for which the @xmath2 value ( 45 mj / mol@xmath21k@xmath22 ) may not be so large , the de - haas van alphen effect measurements have revealed that the fermi surface of ybal@xmath4 is strongly renormalized due to many - body effect of the localized 4@xmath41 moment and the conduction electrons  @xcite .",
    "we therefore suppose that the single - body band effect is not dominating for these systems .      as is pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite , many u - based compounds on the kadowaki - woods line exhibit strong intersite magnetic - correlation , including magnetic ordering in upt , uga@xmath4 and uin@xmath4 , and distinct spin - fluctuations in ual@xmath24 and upt@xmath4 . magnetic correlation due to the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction is also considered to be important for those ce- and yb - based compounds such as ceal@xmath4  @xcite , cecu@xmath24si@xmath24  @xcite , ceb@xmath42  @xcite , cecu@xmath42 , ceru@xmath24si@xmath24  @xcite , ybrh@xmath24si@xmath24  @xcite , and so on . for @xmath23-electron systems such as liv@xmath24o@xmath3  @xcite , yco@xmath24  @xcite and ( y , sc)mn@xmath24",
    "@xcite , the presence of strong magnetic correlation has been demonstrated by neutron scattering or nmr .",
    "it is notable that these compounds include both nearly - ferromagnetic ( ual@xmath24  @xcite , yco@xmath24  @xcite etc . ) and nearly - antiferromagnetic systems ( cecu@xmath42  @xcite , cecu@xmath24si@xmath24  @xcite etc . ) .    on the other hand , for the systems with the smaller @xmath6 value , magnetic correlation does not appear to be important .",
    "physical properties are well explained using a single - impurity model in ybcu@xmath5  @xcite , ybcu@xmath26ag@xmath27  @xcite , ybcu@xmath3ag  @xcite , ybcual  @xcite , ceni@xmath34si@xmath3  @xcite and cesn@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "single - impurity character is also demonstrated by neutron scattering experiments for ybcual  @xcite and ybincu@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "therefore in these compounds , intersite magnetic correlation can be neglected . for ybcu@xmath29 , magnetic ordering",
    "is not observed even at 235 kbar down to 50 mk  @xcite , suggesting the weak rkky interaction .",
    "this remarkable contrast in the strength of magnetic interactions implies that there exist qualitatively different scattering mechanisms in the electrical resistivity . for the case with strong magnetic interactions , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are enhanced both by the large density of state ( dos ) at the fermi energy ( @xmath43 ) and by the strong spin - fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , for the single impurity - like case , the large @xmath1 is solely attributed to the dos at @xmath43 .",
    "one may hence consider that this difference is the possible origin of the two universal @xmath6 relations .",
    "however , this tendency is inconsistent with the theoretical calculations based on the spin fluctuation theory  @xcite .",
    "have shown that the value of @xmath6 is almost constant from the pure kondo regime ( single - impurity limit ) to almost magnetically instability limit .",
    "the value of @xmath6 they estimated is close to the kadowaki - woods relation  @xcite .",
    "similar result is also reported by continentino , who have shown that the @xmath6 value is independent of the distance from magnetic instability  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that there exist some exceptions of the above tendency . in cepd@xmath4 , intersite magnetic correlation",
    "is considered to be of minor importance  @xcite . for ybinau@xmath24 or nb@xmath4sn , no evidence of strong magnetic - correlation",
    "is reported .",
    "however , @xmath6 values in these systems are close to the kadowaki - woods relation . on the other hand ,",
    "pd and pt show the small @xmath6 value , though they are well - known examples of nearly - ferromagnetic metals  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these findings may not justify the above scenario , in which strong intersite magnetic - correlation enhances @xmath6 values .",
    "one may notice that most of the systems with the smaller @xmath6 values in fig .",
    "3 are classified as the intermediate - valent compounds , where crystal - field splitting , @xmath44 , is of minor importance , and the full degeneracy @xmath45 for yb@xmath46 or ce@xmath46 ion is almost preserved  @xcite .",
    "in fact , physical properties of ybcu@xmath3ag , ybcual , cesn@xmath4 and ceni@xmath34si@xmath3 are explained by the impurity model for @xmath45 = 8 ( yb@xmath46 ) or @xmath45 = 6 ( ce@xmath46 ) , as is noted in the preceding subsection . for ybal@xmath4 and ybal@xmath24 ,",
    "shimizu _ et al .",
    "_ have suggested by the @xmath47yb - nmr that the @xmath45 = 8 ground state is well conserved in these compounds  @xcite . even in ybcu@xmath5 , which exhibits a large @xmath48 mj / mol@xmath21k@xmath22 , @xmath44",
    "is considered to be comparable with the kondo temperature @xmath37 , and the low temperature properties are characterized by @xmath45 = 4  @xcite    on the contrary , the systems such as cecu@xmath42 , ceal@xmath4 and cecu@xmath24si@xmath24 are considered to be affected by the crystal - field effect , which reduce the ground state degeneracy down to @xmath45 = 2  @xcite .    the difference in @xmath45",
    "is related to the magnitude of the magnetic moment which participate in the fermi - liquid formation .",
    "it can therefore affect on the @xmath6 values .",
    "we note that the difference between @xmath49 4 and @xmath50 3 states can be crucial .",
    "theoretical calculation predicts that the dos has a peak situated above @xmath43 for the case of @xmath49 4 , whereas the peak is positioned just at @xmath43 for @xmath50 3  @xcite .",
    "similarly , magnetic excitation spectra also show inelastic structure for large @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "hence , we suppose that in those yb- and ce - based intermediate - valent systems , their largely - degenerated states ( @xmath51 ) develop the excitation spectra with qualitatively different shape from that in those heavy - fermion systems with small @xmath45 ( @xmath52 3 ) , resulting in the significant difference in the @xmath6 values . there have been no theories for the @xmath45 dependence of @xmath6 value as far as we know .",
    "theoretical investigation for the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath6 is desired  @xcite .    however , some exceptions for this understanding should be noted . for yb@xmath24co@xmath4ga@xmath34",
    "@xcite , the full degeneracy for yb@xmath46 is considered to be preserved , though they exhibit the same order of @xmath6 as that for the kadowaki - woods relation .",
    "in addition , it is unclear whether all the u - based compounds on the kadowaki - woods line can be understood in terms of @xmath53 ground states . in these u - compounds",
    ", the enhanced low - energy excitations due to intersite magnetic correlation may also be responsible .",
    "we also note that cepd@xmath4 is again exceptional .",
    "this compound is a typical intermediate - valent compound .",
    "the full degeneracy @xmath45 = 6 is considered to be preserved , and the intersite magnetic correlation is also of minor importance  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this compound show the same order of @xmath6 value as that of heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "however , it should be remarked that the carrier concentration of cepd@xmath4 is unusually small ( @xmath54 0.3 per unit cell )  @xcite , and hence this compound would be close to kondo - insulators .",
    "this situation can not allow us to make a naive comparison for cepd@xmath4 .",
    "+   + finally , an important suggestion is given experimentally from the electrical resistivity measurement under pressures .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have examined the @xmath55 of ybni@xmath24ge@xmath24 under pressure , where @xmath56 is the maximum temperature of the resistivity adhering to a @xmath0 power - law , and should be proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "the value of @xmath55 is therefore a measure of @xmath6 .",
    "they have found that @xmath55 increases by a factor about 25 times under high pressures .",
    "similar variation of @xmath55 under pressure has also been reported for cecu@xmath24si@xmath24  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are most likely related to either of the change of the intersite magnetic correlation or that of the ground state degeneracy .",
    "hence , performing similar experiments on much more systems may eventually reveal the underlying origin of the two universal @xmath6 relations .",
    "in addition , the effect of disorder must be carefully taken into consideration .",
    "if the disorder makes little effect on the host - material properties , its effect on the resistivity would be described by the kondo - hole effect , which reduces @xmath1 . on the contrary , in most of systems ,",
    "disorder is considered to affect the whole range of electrical properties in the kondo - lattice formation .",
    "it would reduce the characteristic temperature @xmath58 , which results in the enhanced @xmath1 values",
    ". this may be the case in ybinau@xmath24 , where site disorder easily occur because of its crystal structure .",
    "therefore , the @xmath6 values in several systems may not be intrinsic . experimental works using high quality samples are particularly important .",
    "we have measured the electrical resistivity and have examined the @xmath6 values of ybal@xmath24 , ybinau@xmath24 , ybincu@xmath3 and ybcual . we have also plotted @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 for several systems reported in literature .",
    "the result reveals that the @xmath6 values are not unique among materials , but varies in the range of 0.4@xmath710@xmath8 - 1.0@xmath710@xmath10 @xmath20cm(mol@xmath21k / mj)@xmath22 .",
    "in particular , it has been found that there exists another universal relation ; @xmath6 = 0.4@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath20cm(mol@xmath21k / mj)@xmath22 , for a number of systems including ybcual , ybal@xmath4 , ybincu@xmath3 , ybcu@xmath3al as well as ybcu@xmath5 , ybcu@xmath29 , ybcu@xmath3ag , ybni@xmath24ge@xmath24 , ceni@xmath34si@xmath3 and cesn@xmath4 .",
    "this value of @xmath6 is about 25 times smaller than that known in the kadowaki - woods relation ; @xmath6 = 1.0@xmath710@xmath10 @xmath20cm(mol@xmath21k / mj)@xmath22 .    to explain this deviation ,",
    "several possible mechanisms have been discussed .",
    "the kondo - hole effect or the single - body - band effect may be applicable for some systems .",
    "however , these two mechanisms can not explain the almost universal nature of the smaller @xmath6 values .",
    "thus , we have considered the tendency of these compounds empirically , and have focused on the intersite magnetic correlation and the ground state degeneracy .    as for the former",
    ", we have pointed that most of the systems with the smaller @xmath6 value exhibit single - impurity like behavior .",
    "this suggests that the intersite magnetic interactions are negligible in these systems .",
    "in contrast , many systems on the kadowaki - woods line are known to show strong magnetic correlation .",
    "this tendency is valid for many compounds plotted in fig .",
    "3 . however , this interpretation is inconsistent with the theoretical results based on the spin - fluctuation theory .    as for the latter",
    ", it has been found that the ground state degeneracy @xmath45 differs largely between the systems with the smaller @xmath6 and those on the kadowaki - woods line .",
    "almost all the systems with the smaller @xmath6 values ( except for @xmath23-electron systems ) show largely degenerated ground state ; i.e. , @xmath49 4 . on the other hand ,",
    "those on the kadowaki - woods line are considered to have @xmath53 state due to the crystal - field splitting . since",
    "this difference can affect on the magnitude of the magnetic moment as well as the shape of the excitation spectra , the @xmath6 values may also vary depending on @xmath45 .    for both the cases ,",
    "i.e. , the intersite magnetic correlation and the ground state degeneracy , our interpretations are only empirical . hence , theoretical confirmations are strongly desired .",
