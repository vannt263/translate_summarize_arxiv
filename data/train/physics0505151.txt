    "the liquid argon time projection chamber ( lar tpc ) was proposed by c.  rubbia in 1977 @xcite . with an extensive r&d program , including the construction of several prototypes of increasing mass , the icarus collaboration @xcite has demonstrated the feasibility of this novel technology for large mass detectors .",
    "a 600 ton ( t600 ) module consisting of two identical 300 ton half - modules was built and successfully tested @xcite .",
    "+ the lar tpc is a 3-dimensional homogeneous tracking device with excellent , high resolution imaging properties , and , at the same time it is a fine grain calorimeter for fully contained particles due to the measurement of the energy loss @xmath0 along the charged particle tracks . the detector is ideally suited for neutrino physics and a sensitive search for nucleon decays @xcite . in ultra - pure lar",

    "a charged particle is passing through an ionization medium ( e.g. lar ) and the electrons drift along the electric field lines to the sensors.,width=340 ]    figure  [ ionizchamber ] shows a schematic view of a tpc ; it consists of a cathode , the sensor planes and field shaping electrodes ( not shown in the figure ) to produce a homogeneous drift field .",
    "the ionization electrons drift along the electric drift field to the sensor planes , where the charge is measured . in the lar tpc described here there are three sensor planes : the first two planes are multi - wire proportional chambers and the third plane is a printed circuit board ( pcb ) with conducting strips .",
    "preliminary results obtained with this chamber were published in  @xcite and a detailed description is given in @xcite .",
    "the sensor planes are biased with potentials , such , that the wire chambers are transparent to the drifting electrons , they only pick up an induced signal from the electrons passing through the plane ( induction planes ) , the electrons are then collected on the strips of the third plane ( collection plane ) .",
    "each plane provides a two - dimensional projection of a track with the number of the hit wire ( strip ) and the drift time as coordinates .",
    "the @xmath2 for the drift time is given by trigger counters .",
    "the drift distance is calculated from the measured drift time and the known drift velocity @xmath3 .",
    "combining the wire hits of equal drift time from at least two planes allows the three  dimensional reconstruction of a track  @xcite .    as a consequence of the short mean free path of the drifting electrons in lar , they do not gain enough kinetic energy between collisions to ionize other atoms , thus , there is no charge multiplication at the wires in lar .",
    "however , the high ionization density in the liquid allows a direct measurement of the ionization charge with a very low noise amplifier ; the expected charge for a minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) is of the order of @xmath4  electrons for @xmath5 mm track length ( at a drift field of @xmath6kv / cm ) .",
    "the commercial vme  like caen modules , designed and built for the icarus experiment ( see chapter  [ readout ] ) , have been used as front end electronics .",
    "+ the low drift velocity ( @xmath7mm/@xmath8s at a drift field of @xmath6kv / cm ) and the long drift paths in detectors with big sensitive volumes ( as e.g. in icarus ) implies that the electrons spend a long time in liquid argon .",
    "this leads to the requirement of an extremely low concentration of electronegative impurities ( as e.g. oxygen ) in lar because the drifting electrons can be captured by electronegative atoms or molecules , decreasing the charge arriving at the sensors .",
    "if the impurity concentration is constant over the whole volume , the charge decreases exponentially with the drift time : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mean lifetime of the electrons in argon .",
    "the lifetime is directly connected to the @xmath11 equivalent impurity concentration @xmath12 by an inverse linear relationship @xcite : @xmath13",
    "\\approx \\frac{300}{\\rho [ ppb ] }   \\label{purityconvertion}\\ ] ] the commercial lar 48 is specified to @xmath14ppm ; this corresponds to a mean lifetime of only @xmath15@xmath8s , absolutely insufficient for a tpc .",
    "a considerable amount of r&d has been performed by the icarus collaboration in order to master the argon purification process @xcite .",
    "+ the drift velocity of the electrons in liquid argon is small compared to the thermal velocity as a result of frequent collisions of the electrons with the argon atoms ; it can be approximated by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mean time between collisions .",
    "the drift velocity has been measured at different temperatures as a function of the drift field , and was fitted to an empirical formula @xcite . for later use ( see chapter  [ lorentz - driftvel - diff ] ) we introduce here the mobility of the electrons , defined as @xcite : @xmath18 except for very low e - fields , the electron mobility is not constant . with equation  [ drifteq1 ] , we find for the mobility : @xmath19      the possibility to complement the features of the lar tpc with those provided by a magnetic field has been considered and would open new possibilities @xcite : ( a ) charge discrimination , ( b ) momentum measurement of particles escaping the detector ( e.g. high energy muons ) , ( c ) very precise kinematics , since the measurement precision is limited by multiple scattering ( e.g. @xmath20 4% for a track length of @xmath21 m and a field of @xmath22tesla ) . the challenging possibility to magnetize a very large , multi ",
    "kton , volume of argon has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "+ the orientation of the magnetic field can be chosen such , that the bending direction is in the direction of the drift where the best spatial resolution is achieved .",
    "this is possible since the lorentz angle is small , as is shown below .",
    "however , it is not mandatory and the b  field could also be parallel to the drift field . in the following",
    "we consider the case where the magnetic field is perpendicular to the electric drift field .",
    "+ the required magnetic field for charge discrimination for a thickness @xmath23 in lar ( @xmath24 is the projected thickness into the bending plane ) is given by the bending parameter @xmath25 @xcite , as defined in figure  [ def - bending ] :     definition of the bending parameter @xmath25 of a particle , where @xmath26 is the thickness of the particle trajectory projected into the bending plane , and @xmath27 is the bending radius.,width=340 ]    @xmath28    neglecting the @xmath29 term for @xmath30 , @xmath25 can be approximated by : @xmath31 the radius of curvature @xmath27 of the charged track due to the magnetic field is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath34 is the transverse momentum , i.e. @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the angle between the track and its projection on the bending plane ( pitch angle ) .",
    "thus , the bending becomes : @xmath37 the multiple scattering contribution to @xmath25 can be obtained from ( * ? ? ?",
    "27.10 ) . neglecting the logarithmic correction , inserting @xmath38 cm as radiation length of liquid argon and using the projected deviation @xmath39 ( see also figure  [ def - bending ] ) ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath40 the momentum resolution of a particle bending in a uniform magnetic field can be found from equation  [ curvature ] . with the introduction of the curvature , defined as @xmath41 ,",
    "it becomes : @xmath42 at low momenta , we can safely neglect the contribution from the position measurement error given the readout pitch and drift time resolution and use the ( * ? ? ?",
    "28.44 ) for the @xmath43 due to the multiple scattering .",
    "the momentum resolution is then given by @xmath44 and the statistical significance for charge separation can be written as ( @xmath45 are the bending for positive and negative charges ) : @xmath46 for example , with a field of @xmath47 t , the charge of tracks of @xmath48 cm length can be separated at @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the requirement for a @xmath51 charge discrimination can be written as @xmath52ms , which implies a field strength of @xmath53 for long penetrating tracks like muons , a field of @xmath54 t allows to discriminate the charge for tracks longer than @xmath55 m , if perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this corresponds for example to a muon momentum threshold of @xmath56mev / c .",
    "+ unlike muons or hadrons , the early showering of electrons makes their charge identification difficult . the track - length usable for charge discrimination is limited to a few radiation lengths after which the showers make the recognition of the parent electron more difficult . in practice , charge discrimination is possible for high fields @xmath57tesla , @xmath58tesla , @xmath59tesla .",
    "from simulations , we found that the determination of the charge of electrons of energy in the range between @xmath14 and @xmath60gev is feasible with good purity , provided the field has a strength in the range of @xmath14 t .",
    "preliminary estimates show that these electrons exhibit an average curvature sufficient to have electron charge discrimination with an efficiency of @xmath61% for a contamination with the wrong charge of less than @xmath14% @xcite .    in the presence of a magnetic field a lorentz force is acting on each moving charge , modifying the drift properties of the electrons .",
    "as a consequence , the electrons will not move along the electric field lines , but on a straight line at an angle @xmath62 to the e  field . in general , the drift velocity in a static electromagnetic field is given by ( * ? ? ?",

    "is simplified to : @xmath68   \\label{vdriftmagperp}\\ ] ] from figure  [ lorentz1 ] it can be seen that for the case of perpendicular e and b  fields the lorentz angle @xmath62 is given by : @xmath69     definition of the lorentz angle @xmath62 ( for perpendicular e and b ",

    "a 3d reconstruction of the electron / positron tracks is necessary for a full calorimetric reconstruction and a determination of the total momentum .",
    "a detailed description of the spatial reconstruction procedure is given in  @xcite .    a small sample of 15 @xmath142-electrons and 9 decay positrons , fully contained in the chamber ,",
    "were selected from 30400 recorded and scanned events .",
    "these events were reconstructed and their momentum and kinetic energy was determined from the magnetic bending and the summed up energy loss , respectively @xcite .",
    "+ in figures   [ fig : both ] and [ fig : both - error ] the transverse momentum obtained from the energy ( charge ) measurement is plotted against the momentum from the magnetic bending for @xmath142-electrons and decay positrons together ( circles : @xmath142-electrons , triangles : decay - positrons ) .",
    "the straight line fit ( fit function : @xmath146 ) through the data points is also shown . in figure",
    "[ fig : both ] no errors were assigned to the individual data points and figure  [ fig : both - error ] includes the errors of the transverse momentum due to multiple scattering estimated according to equation [ momentumresolution ] .",
    "these errors are obviously much larger than the scattering of the data points around the fitted straight line ; the @xmath147 is equal 0.05 , indicating that the error is over estimated .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed to the event selection , introducing a bias towards tracks with little multiple scattering showing nicely bent tracks . for the error of the transverse momentum evaluated from the energy see @xcite .",
    "+ the slopes of the two plots are p1=0.9480@xmath148 0.0431 for figure  [ fig : both ] , and p1=0.9122 @xmath149 0.1814 for figure  [ fig : both - error ] ; thus , the slopes are compatible with 1 .",

    "the slope of a linear fit gives an estimate for the ( average ) specific energy loss de / dx , since the energy loss is assumed to be constant ( except for the last 2  mm of a track @xcite ) .",
    "the slope in figure  [ fig : energypath ] corresponds to an average energy loss of 1.642 ( @xmath149 0.069 ) mev / cm .",
    "the theoretically expected value is about 1.9 - 2.2 mev / cm for electrons ( positrons ) in the range between 1 mev and 20 mev .",
    "thus , the measured and the expected values differ by about 20% .",
    "however , the energy loss de / dx from the measured charge depends on the assumed lifetime @xmath10 of the drift electrons ; a first estimate of 150  @xmath8s was used for the lifetime to calculate the kinetic energy .",
    "varying the electron lifetime and recalculating the kinetic energy of all events , the comparison of the average de / dx with the expected theoretical value yields an electron lifetime in the range of 60  @xmath8s - 80@xmath8s .",

    "in an effort to further develop the lar tpc technology , a small test tpc was built and operated for the first time in a magnetic field ( @xmath47 t ) , which was perpendicular to the electric drift field .",
    "the quality of cosmic ray tracks is not significantly decreased with the magnetic field turned on .    combining the excellent imaging and calorimetric properties of a lar tpc with a magnetic field opens new experimental possibilities .",
    "the magnetic bending of charged particles allows the momentum determination also for particles leaving the sensitive volume and the determination of the sign of the electric charge .",
    "the latter feature is a must in future neutrino experiments searching for cp  violating effects in the lepton sector .    a special interface between the icarus front - end electronics ( v791 caen boards ) and the computer was developed and built for the data acquisition system of this experiment .",
    "it is able to store the continuous flow of digital data in a circular buffer and to send the data to the pci card in the computer , once a trigger has occurred .",
    "the buffer size is large enough to store the digitized data of all the channels for a time interval corresponding to the maximal drift time occurring in the chamber .    a small sample of selected @xmath142-ray and muon decay events were analyzed , showing that the momentum of an electron ( positron ) determined from the magnetic bending and from its kinetic energy are consistent for these events .",
