    "symmetry and symmetry - breaking are two key ingredients in modern high energy physics .",
    "while symmetry brings with it unity and simplicity , one often also needs to break it by some mechanism to account for the observations in our universe ; the standard model being a notable example . till now various such mechanisms are known : higgs mechanism @xcite or spontaneous symmetry breaking which was very successfully applied to the standard model , dynamic symmetry breaking via vacuum condensation @xcite , etc .",
    "the earliest idea of using geometry of extra dimensions to break gauge symmetry can be found in the context of `` dimensional reduction by isometries '' @xcite , which is however fundamentally different from the kaluza - klein scenario . in this paper ,",
    "i propose a new geometric mechanism for breaking gauge symmetry in the context of kaluza - klein reduction schemes .",
    "higher dimensional , i.e. greater than 4 , ( super ) gravitational theories are beautiful in that they combine ( four - dimensional ) gravity with gauge interactions through kaluza - klein reduction schemes ( see for example @xcite for details ) in a very geometric way .",
    "one considers the vacuum to be a product of a four - dimensional vacuum manifold ( minkowski , desitter or anti desitter ) , and an ( usually compact ) internal manifold with matching scalar curvature constants .",
    "four - dimensional physics then arises as fluctuations around this vacuum .",
    "for example , if one looks at the massless modes , which are important for describing low energy physics of the higher dimensional metric , then one finds a graviton ( in the four - dimensional sector of the metric ) and gauge bosons ( appearing in the off - diagonal part of the metric ) associated with the killing vectors of the `` frozen '' internal manifold .",
    "after the kaluza - klein reduction of the higher dimensional gravitational action , one obtains a covariant and gauge invariant action of gravity coupled with gauge bosons among other things .",
    "however , as i mentioned earlier , we also need a mechanism to break the gauge symmetry ( at least partially ) to make it compatible with the experimental observations , and what can be better if we also find a geometric origin behind this symmetry breaking !    such a geometric mechanism emerges naturally when one realises that the internal manifold is dynamic in nature , more prominently at earlier times .",
    "it is possible then that the internal manifold started out as say , a maximally symmetric metric space but made a transition to a less symmetric metric space .",
    "such a vacuum to vacuum ( asymptotically ) transition can for example , occur along a classical path ( if such a path is available ) , or through quantum tunneling etc . at any case after the transition , some of the original killing symmetries will no longer remain killing vectors .",
    "let us name the initial and final isometry group of the internal manifold as @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the gauge bosons originally associated with the broken killing symmetries will now pick up a mass term in the action thereby breaking the gauge symmetry group from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "one can indeed calculate the masses of the broken gauge bosons , and the various mass ratios would be a precise prediction coming out of these models .",
    "further given a @xmath2 , it is not always possible to find an einstein metric on the given internal manifold with killing symmetry group @xmath1 .",
    "thus this model also narrows down the list of subgroups that a gauge group can be broken down to . in this paper ,",
    "i concentrate on the simple case when the internal manifold is a lie group ( @xmath3 ) itself , and the maximally isometric group @xmath4 is broken down to @xmath5 , @xmath6 and in particular work out the details when @xmath7 , which is really the simplest example where such a geometric transition is possible .",
    "further , in this paper i only concern myself with pure gravity .",
    "since the analysis relies completely on `` geo - metric '' ideas , it should be straight - forward to embed it in larger frameworks of unified theories of gravity like the string and supergravity ( sugra ) theories .",
    "it should also be possible to generalise the internal manifold to coset spaces ; and in principle to nonhomogeneous spaces which may be more relevant to the string / sugra compactifications .",
    "a crucial consideration when dealing with these different vacua of the internal manifold is the issue of stability @xcite",
    ". it will be specially interesting to find cases where the @xmath5-invariant metric is stable but the @xmath4-invariant one is not , making the geometric transition a very viable prospect .    a natural question that arises in such a scenario is what happened to the counting of states . with each broken killing symmetry ,",
    "the number of physical states increases by one because the vector becomes massive from massless .",
    "the compensation occurs in a manner very similar to that of the higgs mechanism .",
    "the `` freed '' gauge parameters kill some of the scalars ( in the adjoint representation of the original gauge group ) that appear as fluctuations in the metric of the internal manifold ( see section 4 for details ) .",
    "i first review some facts about lie group geometry ( see for example @xcite ) in section 1 , and in particular talk about metrics in @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in section 2 ,",
    "i provide a qualitative understanding of the dynamics of the transition and obtain the `` mass matrix '' for the broken gauge bosons when the internal manifold is a lie group .",
    "as an illustration , i also compute explicitly the mass matrix when the gauge group is broken from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , the internal manifold being @xmath9 . in section 3 , i elucidate on the higgs - like mechanism that helps preserve the number of physical states before and after the geometric transition .",
    "i conclude by summarizing and making some remarks about possible future research .",
    "* geometry of lie groups : * a lie group element @xmath12 can be parametrized as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , the lie algebra corresponding to the lie group @xmath0 and @xmath15 are some given functions of the coordinates @xmath16 charting the lie group manifold .",
    "the lie group generators @xmath17 satisfy the usual commutation relations : @xmath18=c_{{\\breve{a}}{\\breve{b}}}{}^{{\\breve{c}}}t_{{\\breve{c}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are the structure constants of the lie group . with each of the generators @xmath17 , one can associate a left and a right invariant vector field @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively . both sets",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 can serve as vielbeins or local basis vector fields for the tangent space of the lie group .",
    "they are defined via the following relations @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 these two reference frames are related by a local lorentz transformation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the adjoint representation of @xmath0 . in the subsequent discussion we will choose @xmath22 as the local frame of reference . in this frame , a general metric on @xmath0 looks like @xmath29 however , we are interested in metrics with special symmetry properties .",
    "it can be shown that in general the isometry group of a metric will be @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "in particular @xmath32 we will be principally concerned with such right invariant metrics .",
    "these metrics are invariant under the right invariant vector fields @xmath23 , but not in general under the left invariant vector fields .",
    "this follows readily from the commutation relations between them : @xmath33=c_{{\\breve{a}}{\\breve{b}}}{}^{{\\breve{c}}}e_{{\\breve{c}}}\\ ; \\ [ { \\tilde{e}}_{{\\breve{a}}},{\\tilde{e}}_{{\\breve{b}}}]=-c_{{\\breve{a}}{\\breve{b}}}{}^{{\\breve{c}}}{\\tilde{e}}_{{\\breve{c}}}\\ ; \\ [ { \\tilde{e}}_{{\\breve{a}}},e_{{\\breve{b}}}]=0\\ ] ] if we want the metric to be further invariant under say @xmath34 , then it has to satisfy @xmath35 if we suitably choose our generators @xmath36 such that @xmath37 span @xmath38 , then the killing vectors of this @xmath39 ( right ) invariant metric will be the @xmath23 s and the @xmath40 s .",
    "i am using the symbols @xmath41 , and @xmath42 to indicate quantities associated with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the coset space @xmath43 respectively .",
    "a special case of the right invariant metric is the bivariant metric when @xmath44 , i.e. it has the maximal isometry , and is invariant under both @xmath23 and @xmath22 s .",
    "the killing metric given by @xmath45 is an example of such a metric .",
    "further , the killing metric satisfies einstein s field equations , and hence is consistent with its usual identification as kaluza - klein vacuum . however , the killing metric is not the only right invariant metric which is einstein , for some specific @xmath34 s and specific parameter values we can hope to find other right invariant einstein metrics , and hence a kaluza - klein vacuum . + * su(2 ) and su(3 ) : * for the 3-dimensional lie group manifold @xmath8 , the most general ( modulo local lorentz transformations ) right invariant metric that one can write down looks like @xmath46 one can now try to solve einstein s vacuum field equations : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is related to the cosmological constant .",
    "it turns out that the only solution corresponds to @xmath49 which is proportional to the bivariant killing metric .",
    "thus there is no einstein @xmath50 metric , and consequently we can not break the gauge group @xmath51 to @xmath50 with @xmath52 .    for @xmath9 however , we do have more than one right invariant einstein metric . a convenient and simple way to find such metrics",
    "is to start with the killing metric and then scale the metric sector corresponding to the subgroup @xmath1 that we want to preserve by a parameter which i will refer to as @xmath53 : @xmath54 here @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the killing and scaled metric respectively .",
    "now for specific values of this parameter one may find einstein metrics . applying the ansatz ( 2.14 ) to ( 2.12 ) for @xmath9",
    "one can find a vacuum metric which is invariant under @xmath57 , but none which is invariant under @xmath58 or @xmath59 .    to see this in more detail",
    "let us first label the generators .",
    "@xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 plugging the structure constants corresponding to the generators ( 2.15 ) in ( 2.10 ) one computes the killing metric : @xmath63 here the ordering of the rows and columns is the same as the order in which the generators are written above .",
    "the ansatz for a @xmath64 ( generated by the @xmath65 s ) invariant metric then looks like @xmath66 and plugging ( 2.17 ) in ( 2.12 ) , one finds ( 2.17 ) is einstein for @xmath67 while the former corresponds to the killing metric , the latter is a @xmath57 invariant metric .    in a similar manner ,",
    "if one wants to obtain an @xmath68 ( generated by the @xmath69 s ) invariant metric , the ansatz then looks like @xmath70 which satisfies einstein s field equations for @xmath71 the latter corresponds to an @xmath58 invariant metric , but it has a different signature and hence is not a `` proper '' vacuum metric on @xmath9 .",
    "the same thing happens when we try to obtain an @xmath72 invariant einstein metric .",
    "using a similar ansatz one finds that there are no nonsingular einstein @xmath59 invariant metric .",
    "in fact , the only choices for a @xmath39 invariant vacuum metric are @xmath73 or @xmath9 .",
    "* kaluza - klein vacua : * we consider a @xmath74 dimensional space - time manifold with 4 ordinary ( large ) space - time dimensions , labeled by @xmath75 and @xmath76 extra compact dimensions forming the `` internal manifold '' charted by @xmath16 .",
    "the vielbein and its inverse , corresponding to the kaluza - klein vacuum is then given by @xmath78 with the einstein metric @xmath79 here the four - dimensional part of the vielbein corresponds to either the minkowski , or the desitter spaces according to the sign of the scalar curvature constant of the internal manifold . for ( 3.1 - 3.2 ) to be a vacuum ,",
    "@xmath80 also need to satisfy the @xmath76 dimensional einstein s field equations for the internal manifold .",
    "historically , although seeds of nonabelian generalization of kaluza - klein reduction scheme can be seen in as early as klein s and pauli s works ( see @xcite for details ) , it was kerner @xcite who first performed a complete nonabelian analysis by considering lie groups as internal manifolds .",
    "we will also specialize to the case when the internal manifold is a ( semisimple ) lie group @xmath0 .",
    "we already know that there exists one einstein vacuum in the form of the killing metric ( @xmath81 ) which is invariant under @xmath82 , and we will also assume that there is another einstein metric @xmath83 which is invariant under @xmath39",
    ". we can choose the lie group generators @xmath36 ( as discussed in the previous section ) so that @xmath37 generates @xmath38 .",
    "we can then parameterise the group element as @xmath84 let us now consider the situation when the internal manifold makes a transition from @xmath81 to @xmath83 .",
    "now , all the left and the right invariant vector fields are killing vectors for the killing metric , but the killing vectors of the scaled metric are given by the right invariant vector fields @xmath85 and the left invariant vector fields @xmath86 thus the @xmath87 s constitute the broken killing symmetry generators . + * transition and reduction : * we are now ready to investigate the fluctuations around the kaluza klein vacuum",
    ". we will be principally interested in the massless modes as they are the most important ones in the low energy description of physics .",
    "further , although these ideas should be applied ultimately to supergravity ( sugra ) theories ( see the subsection `` dynamical considerations and supergravity '' for detail ) , for simplicity we will only concern ourselves with the massless modes coming from the @xmath74 dimensional metric here .",
    "it is well known what these massless modes are : it consists of the spin 2 graviton ( fluctuations around the four - dimensional sector of the vacuum vielbein ) , and spin 1 gauge bosons associated with the killing vectors of the internal manifold ( occurring as fluctuations around the off diagonal part of the vielbein ) .",
    "now consider what happens to these modes if the internal manifold itself makes a transition from a maximally isometric space ( @xmath82 invariant metric ) to a less symmetric space ( @xmath39 invariant , @xmath88 ) .",
    "such a geometric transition can take place at an earlier cosmic time when the energy scales involved suggest a truely dynamic internal manifold .",
    "of course , such a vacuum to vacuum geometric transition can not be understood perturbatively , and to analyse it comprehensively is indeed a difficult task . in this paper",
    ", i will only give a brief outline of what such a program will entail ( see `` dynamical considerations and supergravity '' ) and leave the details for further research .",
    "we now focus on the consequences of such a transition , in particular on the massless modes .",
    "nothing happens to gravity , but clearly the gauge bosons associated with the broken killing vectors will now no longer be massless . the initial @xmath82 nonabelian gauge theory , consisting of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , associated with @xmath91 s and @xmath92 s respectively , is now partially broken to a @xmath39 gauge theory , comprising of the gauge fields @xmath89 and @xmath93 , while @xmath94 s pick up mass terms",
    "our aim now is to compute the `` mass - matrix '' for these broken gauge fields .",
    "since we agree that the graviton @xmath95 , and the gauge bosons @xmath89 associated with the right invariant vectors remain massless after the transition , we can focus only on the fluctuations of the vielbein due to the left invariant vector fields . @xmath96",
    "the form of the vielbein is not to be treated as an ansatz , which has to then satisfy several consistency conditions gauge symmetry in the low energy effective theory ( once all the modes necessary for a consistent truncation are taken into account ) which is broken , after the transition to @xmath39 .",
    "if one is still worried about the consistency requirements , this scheme can be thought of as breaking a @xmath97 gauge theory to @xmath34 . ] , but rather as containing the relevant fluctuations to describe the low energy fluctuations .",
    "for example , this will enable us to compute the gauge boson mass generated through this transition .",
    "it is a straight - forward exercise to compute @xmath98 .",
    "one obtains @xmath99 where @xmath100}+c_{{\\breve{a}}{\\breve{b}}}{}^{{\\breve{c}}}a_m^{{\\breve{a}}}a_n^{{\\breve{b}}}]\\ ] ] and @xmath101\\ ] ] while @xmath102 thus we have @xmath103\\ ] ] we note that both @xmath104 and @xmath105 are constants ; since both the four - dimensional and the internal manifold are einstein and hence have constant scalar curvatures .",
    "thus after integrating out the extra compact dimensions , we have the effective action for the gauge fields : @xmath106 + actually , as is clear from the action , @xmath107 really represents the mass square . for the maximally symmetric internal manifold it vanishes , whereas the broken sector is non - vanishing for the scaled metric . +",
    "* the example of su(3 ) : * we had previously seen that the only einstein right invariant metric on @xmath8 is also invariant under @xmath108 . hence a geometric symmetry breaking to @xmath109",
    "can not occur .",
    "@xmath9 is the `` simplest '' group manifold which can exibit a geometric transition . in section 2",
    ", we obtained some right invariant metrics on @xmath9 which were einstein , out of which only the killing metric and the @xmath64 invariant metric can become consistent kaluza - klein vacua .",
    "thus the `` geometric transition '' mechanism predicts that if we want to break the gauge group @xmath110 to @xmath111 , @xmath112 , then @xmath1 has to be @xmath113 .    as expected the mass matrix for the killing metric vanishes , but for the @xmath113-scaled metric it looks like @xmath114 one immediately observes that all the broken gauge bosons are now massive , while the unbroken gauge masses vanish , again as expected .",
    "next , let us choose a basis where the mass matrix is diagonal : @xmath115 the matrix now reads @xmath116 as is usual in kaluza - klein theories , the masses depend inversely on the `` radius '' @xmath117 ( hidden in 3.13 ) of the compact internal manifold which can be seen as follows : @xmath118 thus it is only the mass ratios of the gauge bosons that come out as a precise prediction of this model . in this case the mass squares of @xmath119 s are half as those of @xmath120 s and the typical mass of the broken gauge bosons are given by @xmath121 * dynamical considerations and supergravity : * we have seen how in general geometric transition of the internal manifold can explain symmetry breaking of gauge theories .",
    "it is imperative then that we try to understand how or when such a transition can occur .",
    "if a classical path connects the two vacua , initial fluctuations and instabilities can then trigger a `` classical transition '' .",
    "alternatively , this could be brought about by quantum tunneling effects .",
    "although it might seem hopelessly difficult to analyse this `` infinite - mode '' coupled system , the ansatz for @xmath56 ( 2.14 ) gives us important clues as to what may be going on .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 which determines the `` shape '' of the manifold changes as it makes a transition . to maintain @xmath122 , it is clear that the `` size '' of the internal manifold must also change .",
    "we also know how the external manifold ( the four dimensional world ) behaves asymptotically .",
    "for example , if we restrict ourselves to the case when @xmath123 , then we expect an asymptotically desitter vacuum whose metric in a special coordinate system can be written as @xmath124 thus it is natural to consider the full ansatz for the metric as @xmath125 @xmath126 and @xmath127 are to be treated as time dependent collective coordinates characterizing the size and the shape of the manifold respectively , @xmath128 is the usual cosmological radius of our universe while @xmath129 corresponds to a gauge freedom ( which may be useful for later computational purposes ) .",
    "asymptotically we expect @xmath130 ( in the @xmath131 gauge ) before and after the transition , while @xmath132 should extrapolate between the two vacuum values .",
    "classically , we now have to solve einstein s equations ( 2.12 ) .",
    "from the symmetry of ( 3.14 ) we expect to obtain four equations coming from the @xmath133 component of ( 2.12 ) , out of which one can be thought of as a gauge fixing condition .",
    "it should be pointed out that one may need to include matter / radiation contributions in einstein s equations in a more realistic cosmoslogical setting and/or to incorporate sugra effects . at any case ,",
    "in the end we will have four ordinary differential equations in four variables .",
    "however , such nonlinear differential equations coming from general relativity are usually notoriously difficult to solve and perhaps one has to employ both analytic and numerical techniques to analyse it in detail .    alternatively , one can substitute the ansatz ( 3.14 ) in einstein s action @xmath134 and obtain an effective quantum mechanical action for @xmath135 and @xmath127 . it",
    "should then be possible to understand both qualitatively and quantitatively some of the quantum aspects of the problem .",
    "one can try to compute the quantum tunneling amplitude from the effective potential and also gain insight into a related and very crucial issue , that of stabilities of the vacua .",
    "stability of kaluza - klein vacuum has previously been studied @xcite , specifically in the context of sugra theories .",
    "for example , it is well known that vacua s which preserve some supersymmetry are stable @xcite , and thus it is important that we analyse the supersymmetric properties of the maximally symmetric and scaled metrics which are involved in the geometric transition .",
    "it should be mentioned that previously such `` less symmetric '' vacuum metrics on some coset spaces and their supersymmetric properties have been studied in the context of supergravity compactifications and they go by the name of `` squashed spaces '' @xcite . indeed some of these squashed spaces were found to admit killing spinors , i.e. preserve some supersymmetry and hence are stable , making a geometric transition to these less symmetric spaces viable .",
    "stable but non - supersymmetric vacuum solutions also exist and their stability can be analysed by looking at the eigenvalues of the lichnerowicz operator acting on some tensor fields on the internal manifold ( please see @xcite for some recent work ) .",
    "similar methods can be adopted to study the vacuum solutions that i considered in this paper .    in passing from pure gravity to supergravity",
    "we not only introduce fermions ( and supersymmetry ) but also usually some scalars and gauge forms .",
    "the presence of the gauge forms will enable us to consider not only the purely geometric vacua that we have been considering , but also the freund - rubin type vacua @xcite with non - zero gauge form flux , and transitions between them .",
    "this is specially useful for sugra s with no cosmological constants to begin with ( like the 11 dimensional sugra ) , because the stress - tensor of the gauge forms behave as an effective cosmological constant ( except that it differs in sign for the external and the internal manifold ) and thereby let us consider non - ricci flat internal manifolds",
    ". in freund - rubin type mechanisms the massless vectors recieve contributions ( say @xmath136 ) from the gauge forms and our analysis has to be suitably modified to incorporate this effect .",
    "however , presumably the geometric transition will preserve the masslessness of the same vector combinations ( i.e. @xmath137 ) as in the pure gravity case , leaving the other combinations ( @xmath138 ) broken .",
    "the fact that the gauge transformations ( which follows from the general coordinate transformations in the extra dimensions , see the following section)of the @xmath139 s both before and after the transition remains unaltered even within the framework of sugra , corroborates the above arguement .",
    "the @xmath136 s have to essentially transform the same way as the @xmath139 s under the gauge symmetry @xmath0 and should also break the same way as the @xmath139 s under @xmath1 , which suggests that the mass matrix should remain intact , barring an overall factor .",
    "a natural question to ask at this point would be , what happens to the number of physical degrees of freedom !",
    "clearly , for each broken generator , the gauge boson becomes massive from massless , thereby increasing the number of physical states by one .",
    "however , we will see that like in higg s mechanism , here also the `` freed gauge parameter '' corresponding to the broken gauge bosons can be used to eliminate some of the scalars that are present in the full theory . to make this explicit",
    "let us identify , and include these scalars in the vielbein : @xmath140 with @xmath141_{{\\breve{a}}}{}^{{\\breve{b}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 are the generators of @xmath0 in the adjoint representation . in other words ,",
    "the scalars @xmath143 are in the adjoint representation of the group @xmath0 .",
    "now let us look at the gauge transformations , which are essentially the translations along the killing vectors of the internal manifold : @xmath144 under this coordinate transformation , the gauge fields and the scalars transform as ] @xmath145 and @xmath146 while ( 4.4 ) is the familiar nonabelian gauge transformation , using ( 4.5 ) we can eliminate the scalars that we introduced .",
    "we are now ready to count the number of states before and after the transition . the best way to do",
    "it is to look at the physical degrees of freedom associated with @xmath147 and @xmath139 .",
    "now @xmath148 for the killing metric we know from ( 9 ) @xmath149 and thus @xmath150 i.e. there are no degrees of freedom associated with @xmath151 s to begin with can be expanded as a sum of harmonic functions / modes on the internal manifold .",
    "the coefficients are four - dimensional fields and constitutes the degrees of freedom associated with @xmath152 .",
    "( 4.6 ) tells us that @xmath151 s are not associated with any such mode and hence do not constitute any degree of freedom in the theory . ] . like wise ,",
    "the gauge parameters @xmath153 s are used as gauge parameters for the massless @xmath154 gauge fields .",
    "we thus have @xmath155 physical states coming from the gauge bosons , where @xmath156 is the number of internal dimensions .    for the scaled metric however , things are different .",
    "( 2.9 ) tells us that @xmath157 thus we have @xmath158 and we see that although the @xmath159 s are spurious ( as in the maximal case ) , the @xmath160 s are associated with the mode functions @xmath161 , and hence are apriori present as genuine degrees of freedom in the theory for both the maximal and the non - maximal case .",
    "if we include these scalars , the total number of physical states in the maximal case goes up to @xmath162 in the non - maximal case , we only need the @xmath163 s to preserve gauge symmetry , and the total number of physical states coming from the vectors are : @xmath164 the @xmath165 s which are still left now can be utilized to eliminate the @xmath160 s via ( 4.5 ) .",
    "thus the total number of physical states is again given by @xmath166    quite simply , what is going on is that the number of degrees of freedom in the metric and the gauge parameter is the same for both the maximal and the non - maximal case . in the maximal case",
    "all the gauge parameters @xmath153 s are utilized to eliminate degrees of freedom from the gauge fields , while in the non - maximal case the @xmath163 s do just that , but the @xmath165 s eliminate some of the scalars .",
    "this is exactly analogous to what happens in higg s mechanism .",
    "in this paper i have tried to explain how the dynamics of the internal manifold can break the gauge symmetry partially . as an illustrative example i considered the manifold @xmath9 which admits both a @xmath110 and a @xmath57 invariant vacuum . if and when the metric makes a vacuum to vacuum transition from the maximal to the non - maximally symmetric space , the gauge fields corresponding to the broken killing symmetries will pick up a mass , thereby breaking the gauge invariance from @xmath110 to @xmath57 .",
    "this geometric symmetry breaking mechanism has two definite predictions .",
    "first is a restriction of the subgroups into which the original gauge group can be broken , and this comes about because we can not always find vacuum metrics invariant under a specific subgroup .",
    "secondly , this model makes a precise prediction about the various mass ratios of the broken gauge bosons .",
    "the counting of physical states also works out fine when one properly takes into account some of the scalar degrees of freedom that are present in the full theory .",
    "the `` freed '' gauge parameter can eliminate these scalars in the non - maximal case , and thus the situation is exactly analogous to the higg s mechanism where the gauge bosons become massive , `` eating away '' some of the scalars .",
    "though this geometric transition mechanism seems consistent , to make it more convincing one should study the transition itself .",
    "for example , why and how can such a transition occur ? as a first test , we should look for classical solutions connecting the two vacua ( possibly asymptotically ) .",
    "if such a solution does not exist , quantum tunneling can still bring about such a transition .",
    "the stability of the scaled metric is of course crucial to gauruntee that the internal manifold remains there and hence has to be carefully analysed . assuming that a geometric transition of the internal manifold is possible",
    ", our next task will be to understand its implications .",
    "i have already explained how this process will partially break gauge symmetry and thus one can apply this procedure to break electro - weak symmetry or grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "the nice thing about this model is that it corroborates our general idea that the early universe was in a more symmetric phase , and then ( through this geometric transition ) came to exist in a less symmetric phase . to understand this theory in more detail ,",
    "one will need to look at the truncation procedure carefully .",
    "dynamical considerations suggest that some scalar fields ( of comparable mass as the broken gauge bosons ) play an important role in the effective theory , and their potential may be crucial in further understanding , like in the higg s mechanism .",
    "also , i performed the analysis only with pure einstein - hilbert action , and ignoring the dilaton , other gauge fields and the fermions . in a sugra theory ,",
    "one obviously has to incorporate these fields and i have only hinted at what extensions / modifications that may be needed in our model .",
    "one should also investigate whether such a geometric transition has any cosmological consequences .",
    "finally , it should be possible to generalise the internal manifolds and metrics that i considered in this paper .",
    "i analysed only the very simple case when the internal manifold is a lie group , and when the vacuum metrics are all right invariant .",
    "one can try to look at other less symmetric metrics which are neither left nor right invariant .",
    "it should also not be too difficult to generalise this mechanism to more realistic internal manifolds like the coset spaces ( and in particular those which can give standard model like gauge groups ) , and at least in principle to some of the more interesting nonhomogenous spaces .",

    "<S> in this paper , i explain how gauge symmetry can be broken in a geometric way ,  la kaluza - klein . in higher dimensional gravitational theories , one usually considers the extra dimensions to be `` frozen '' in time . </S>",
    "<S> however , the internal manifold is actually a dynamic entity . </S>",
    "<S> for example , its metric can change even if one expects its topological properties to be invariant . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable then , that at an earlier epoch the internal manifold made a geometric transition from say a maximally symmetric metric space to a less symmetric one . we know in a kaluza - klein reduction scheme , the massless gauge bosons are associated with the killing vectors of the internal manifold . </S>",
    "<S> after the transition of the internal manifold , the gauge bosons associated with the broken killing isometries will pick up a mass thereby breaking the gauge invariance partially . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> i explore this idea , work out the mass of broken gauge bosons for some simple examples , and also point out how a mechanism similar to that of higgs may be at work .     </S>",
