    "something analogous occurs in the annni model where an antiferromagnetic long - range - ordered phase can intervene between the ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic phase when the temperature is increased for specific lattice geometries and strengths of the competing interactions  @xcite .",

    "the thin dfif and an equivalent model of coulomb - frustrated phase separation  @xcite belong to this class . in the range of values of @xmath0 defined by the inequality",
    "two remarkable effects may occur .",
    "+ first , as the modulation length decreases with increasing temperature , the compression modulus @xmath132 may _ increase _ with temperature according to eq .  .",
    "the class of matter defined by the inequality   exhibits a state of potentially anomalous compression modulus in which , e.g. , it becomes more difficult for the system to accommodate disorder involving deviations from the equilibrium modulation length when the temperature is increased ; the system becomes _ less _ responsive to fluctuations at higher temperatures .",
    "this behavior is at odds with what normally happens .",
    "in fact , traditional elastic constants are , in the harmonic approximation , temperature independent and the small correction due to anharmonic contributions typically soften them with increasing temperature  @xcite . for the thin dfif , we tentatively associated this hardening of the compression modulus , @xmath132 , with the re - entrance of stripe order during pattern transformations .",
    "although we do not know how @xmath132 relates to the patterns , we suggest that our results indicate the need of refining the various scenarios for topological phase transitions  @xcite to take into account the role of anomalous behavior of elastic constants .",
    "+ second , the scaling hypothesis , eq .  , predicts that lines marking the transition between two different phases on the @xmath124 plane have the shape of a `` funnel '' rather than of a `` dome '' ( like in traditional phase diagrams ) .",
    "this anomalous topology has an important consequence .",
    "the vast majority of phase transitions in condensed matter , particle physics and cosmology proceeds by a mechanism known as symmetry breaking ( sb )  @xcite . as pointed out in section  [ sec_iv ] and sketched in fig .  2",
    ", only sb transitions are compatible with a dome - like phase diagram  @xcite : the phase outside the dome ( high @xmath116 or high @xmath98 ) has full rotational and translational symmetry , while the region enclosed by the dome boundaries corresponds to a phase with less symmetry elements .",
    "thus , the degree of symmetry of two different phases involved in a transition can only be reduced by lowering the temperature .",
    "this rule , governing the ordinary scenario of thermodynamic phase transitions , can be violated when a phase diagram displays a funnel shape and isb transformations may also occur  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "such transitions , though rarely , have been indeed observed in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "the experimental phase diagram of ultra - thin fe films on cu(001 ) , a model system for thin dfif ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , shows the funnel shape predicted by our scaling hypothesis  @xcite . along some specific paths on the @xmath124 plane a sb transition from a uniform pattern to a striped phase  which breaks both the full rotational and translational symmetry ",
    "is observed upon lowering the temperature ; when the temperature is further lowered , the following isb processes are also encountered :    * a stripe - to - bubble phase transition , which restores the rotational symmetry * a bubble - to - uniform phase transition , which restores the full translational symmetry .",
    "these experimental observations strongly support our scaling hypothesis .    in conclusion",
    ", our scaling hypothesis predicts that the functional in eq .   is compatible with both sb and isb processes .",
    "note that the functional discussed in this paper is fundamentally different from the one described by recent models introduced to explain isb anomalies in condensed matter physics  @xcite",
    ". in particle physics and cosmology , a model of isb based on a multi - component scalar field has been proposed in the context of unresolved fundamental problems such as the cp - violation during baryogenesis , the inflation of the universe or the formation of cosmological defects  @xcite . here",
    ", instead , we always deal with a single component scalar field .",
    "another remarkable difference with respect to current models of isb lies on the fact that whether the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "can produce sb or isb processes just depends on @xmath4 and @xmath0 , not on the particular choice of the coupling constants or on some _ ad hoc _ assumptions .",

    "<S> we propose a scaling hypothesis for pattern - forming systems in which modulation of the order parameter results from the competition between a short - ranged interaction and a long - ranged interaction decaying with some power @xmath0 of the inverse distance . with @xmath1 being a spatial length characterizing the modulated phase , all thermodynamic quantities </S>",
    "<S> are predicted to scale like some power of @xmath1 , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling dimensions @xmath3 only depend on the dimensionality of the system @xmath4 and the exponent @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> scaling predictions are in agreement with experiments on ultra - thin ferromagnetic films and computational results . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our scaling hypothesis implies that , for some range of values @xmath5 , inverse - symmetry - breaking transitions may appear systematically in the considered class of frustrated systems . </S>"
