    ", musitelli presents a first polynomial - time algorithm for recognizing binet matrices .",
    "in particular , his algorithm inputs a matrix @xmath5 that is potentially binet , and tries to reverse - engineer ( using only row operations ) the matrix into a signed - graphic incidence matrix . if @xmath5 is binet , then his algorithm finds a sequence of row operations bringing the matrix into a signed - graphic incidence matrix ; otherwise , his algorithm determines that @xmath5 is not binet .",
    "however , we saw a number of concerns in musitelli s work .",
    "musitelli considers only row operations , and not column scaling , in order to recover a signed graph matrix from a binet one .",
    "moreover , several different signed graph matrices can have the same row - reduced standard representation , but musitelli does not mention which signed graph his algorithm returns , given a binet matrix .",
    "this research was motivated by the desire to investigate the importance of column scaling in relating two signed - graphic representations of the same matroid .",
    "-0.2 in      we used the sage mathematics software @xcite to generate many examples of signed - graphic matroids and their signed - graphic representations .",
    "in particular , we first generated all non - isomorphic 3-connected uniquely @xmath7-representable matroids of size up to 10 that could potentially be signed - graphic ; then for each of these matroids , we computed all its non - isomorphic signed - graphic representations , and used sage notebook to draw the corresponding signed graphs .",
    "our algorithms are discussed in sections [ section : alg_matroid ] and [ section : alg_reps ] .",
    "using our sage code , we were able to generate many interesting examples of signed graphs .",
    "out of the 69 dyadic matroids we generated , 13 matroids had signed - graphic representations such that each pair of representations is row - equivalent ; 39 had signed - graphic representations such that each pair is not row - equivalent ; and the remaining 17 had signed - graphic representations such that some pairs are row - equivalent and some are not .",
    "appendix [ app : signedgraphs ] provides an example of each kind .",
    "in section [ section : matroid - preserving_operations ] we discuss an interesting matroid - preserving operation on a signed graph , which we call the _ cylinder flip _ , that relates certain pairs of signed - graphic representations of the same matroid .",
    "then in section [ section : restricting_column_scaling ] we present the brylawski - lucas theorem , and illustrate how restricting column scaling to the factors @xmath8 weakens the theorem .",

    "a matroid is _ signed - graphic _ if it can be represented by an incidence matrix of a signed graph .",

    "if @xmath106 is 3-connected and @xmath4 is not 3-connected , then @xmath93 must be a series pair or a coloop .",
