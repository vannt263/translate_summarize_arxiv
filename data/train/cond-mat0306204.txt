    "modern studies of quantum magnetism in condensed matter physics go beyond explaining details of particular experiments on the cuprate superconductors , the heavy fermion materials , organic conductors , or related materials , and aim to develop general paradigms for understanding complex orders in strongly interacting many body systems @xcite .",
    "spinor atoms in optical lattices provide a novel realization of quantum magnetic systems that have several advantages compared to their condensed matter counterparts , including precise knowledge of the underlying microscopic models , the possibility to control parameters of the effective lattice hamiltonians , and the absence of disorder .",
    "degenerate alkali atoms are generally considered as a weakly interacting gas due to the smallness of the scattering length compared to the inter particle separation @xcite .",
    "the situation may change dramatically either when atomic scattering length is changed by means of feshbach resonance @xcite , or when an optical potential created by standing laser beams confines particles in the minima of the periodic potential and strongly enhances the effects of interactions . in the latter case existence of the nontrivial mott insulating state of atoms in optical lattices , separated from the superfluid phase by the quantum phase transition ( si transition ) , was demonstrated recently in experiments @xcite .",
    "low energy ( temperature ) properties of spinless bosonic atoms in a periodic optical potential are well described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite @xmath1 parameters of ( [ bhhamiltonian ] ) may be controlled by varying the intensity of laser beams , so one can go from the regime in which the kinetic energy dominates ( weak periodic potential , @xmath2 ) , to the regime where the interaction energy is the most important part of the hamiltonian ( strong periodic potential , @xmath3 ) . for integer fillings ( number of atoms per lattice site ) , the two regimes have superfluid and mott insulating ground states , respectively , as can be obtained from the mean - field analysis of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite . in the superfluid phase",
    ", atoms are delocalized in the lattice , fluctuations in the number of atoms in each site are strong , and there is a phase coherence between different sites . in the insulating state , atoms are localized , fluctuations in the particle number at each site are suppressed , and there is a gap to all excitations .",
    "such an insulating state represents a correlated many body state of bosons , where strong interactions between atoms result in a new ground state of the system .    in conventional magnetic traps ,",
    "spins of atoms are frozen so effectively that they behave like spinless particles .",
    "in contrast , optically trapped atoms have extra spin degrees of freedom which can exhibit different types of magnetic orderings .",
    "in particular , alkali atoms have a nuclear spin @xmath4 .",
    "lower energy hyperfine manifold has 3 magnetic sublevels and a total moment @xmath5 various properties of such condensate in a single trap were investigated @xcite .",
    "for example , for particles with antiferromagnetic interactions , such as @xmath6 , the exact ground state of an even number of particles in the absence of a magnetic field is a spin singlet described by a rather complicated correlated wave function @xcite .",
    "however , when the number of particles in the trap is large , the energy gap separating the singlet ground state from the higher energy excited states is extremely small , and for the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , the precession time of the classical mean - field ground state is of the order of the trap lifetime .",
    "so , experimental observation of the quantum spin phenomena in such systems is very difficult . to amplify quantum spin effects one would like to have a system with smaller number of particles and stronger interactions between atoms .",
    "hence it is natural to consider an idea of @xmath7 atoms in an optical lattice , in which one can have a small number of atoms per lattice site ( in experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite this number was around 1 - 3 ) and relatively strong interactions between atoms .",
    "in this paper we study bosonic @xmath7 atoms in optical lattices with spin symmetric confining potentials and antiferromagnetic interaction between atoms .",
    "we demonstrate that spin degrees of freedom result in a rich phase diagram by establishing the existence of several distinct insulating phases , which differ from each other by their spin correlations .    in the insulating state of bosons in an optical lattice fluctuations in the particle number on each site are suppressed but not frozen out completely .",
    "virtual tunnelling of atoms between neighboring lattice sites gives rise to effective spin exchange interactions that determine the spin structure of the insulating states ( spin exchange interactions for @xmath8 bosons in optical lattices were discussed previously in @xcite ) .",
    "we will show that in two and three dimensional lattices insulating states with an odd number of atoms per site are always nematic , whereas insulating states states at even fillings are either singlet or spin nematic @xcite , depending on the parameters of the model .",
    "in one dimensional systems even more exotic ground states should be realized , including the possibility of a spin singlet dimerized phase that breaks lattice translational symmetry @xcite .",
    "the 2d and 3d general phase diagram , including singlet , nematic and superfluid phases , is shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediag0 ] .",
    "the extended version of this diagram , including discussion of various transition lines , is presented in section [ globalphase diagram ] .",
    "it is useful to point out that the lattice model for spin-1 bosons , which we analyze here , is very general and may also be applicable to systems other than cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "for example , triplet superconductors in strong coupling limit may be described by a similar hamiltonian , and some of the phases discussed in this article may correspond to non - bcs states of such superconductors @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ introtoformalism ]",
    "we provide derivation of the hubbard - type hamiltonian for spin-1 bosons in optical lattices starting from microscopic interactions between atoms , and describe some general properties of our model . in section [ nodd ]",
    "we derive an effective spin hamiltonian which is valid for any odd number of atoms per site , @xmath9 , in the limit of small tunnelling between sites .",
    "we demonstrate equivalence between our system and a heisenberg model for @xmath7 spins on a lattice with biquadratic interactions and argue that the ground state is a nematic in two and three dimensions and is a dimerized singlet in 1d . in section [ n2 ]",
    "we derive effective spin hamiltonian for a system with @xmath10 atoms per site , valid deep in the insulating regime , and use mean - field approximation to determine the phase boundaries between isotropic and nematic phases . in section [ nbig ]",
    "we derive effective spin hamiltonian for the limit of large number of particles per site @xmath11 and small tunnelling , and discuss isotropic - nematic transition for even @xmath9 . in section [ globalphase diagram ]",
    "we summarize our results and review the global phase diagram for spin-1 bosons in optical lattices .",
    "finally , in section [ experiment ] , we discuss approaches to experimental detection of singlet and nematic insulating phases of @xmath7 bosons .",
    "details of technical calculations are presented in appendices a - d .",
    "at low energies scattering between two identical alkali atoms with the hyperfine spins @xmath7 is well described by the contact potential @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the projection operator for the pair of atoms into the state with total spin @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the @xmath16-wave scattering length in the spin @xmath17 channel ; and @xmath18 is the atomic mass .",
    "when writing ( [ vr1r2 ] ) we used the fact that @xmath16-wave scattering of identical bosons in the channel with total spin @xmath19 is not allowed by the symmetry of the wave function .",
    "interaction ( [ vr1r2 ] ) can be written using spin operators as @xmath20 for example , in the case of @xmath0 , @xmath21 and we find effective antiferromagnetic interaction , as was originally discussed in @xcite .",
    "kinetic motion of ultracold atoms in the optical lattice is constrained to the lowest bloch band when temperature and interactions are smaller than the band gap ( this is the limit that we will consider from now on ) .",
    "atoms residing on the same lattice site have identical orbital wave functions and their spin wave functions must be symmetric . if we introduce creation operators , @xmath22 , for states in the lowest bloch band localized on site @xmath23 and having spin components @xmath24 , we can follow the approach of @xcite and write the effective lattice hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total number of atoms on site @xmath23 , and @xmath27 is the total spin on site @xmath23 ( @xmath28 are the usual spin operators for spin 1 particles ) .",
    "the first term in ( [ originalhamiltonian ] ) describes spin symmetric tunnelling between nearest - neighbor sites , the second term describes hubbard repulsion between atoms , and the third term penalizes non - zero spin configurations on individual lattice sites .",
    "the origin of this spin dependent term is the difference in scattering lengths for @xmath29 and @xmath30 channels as was discussed in @xcite . finally , the fourth term in ( [ originalhamiltonian ] ) is the chemical potential that controls the number of particles in the system .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ originalhamiltonian ] ) carries important constraints on possible spin states of the system .",
    "the first of them derives from the fact that the total spin of a system of @xmath9 spin-1 atoms can not be bigger than @xmath9 , so for each lattice site we have @xmath31 the second constraint is imposed by the symmetry of the spin wave function on each site @xmath32    optical lattices produced by far detuned lasers with wavelength @xmath33 create an optical potential @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the wave vectors of laser beams . using various orientations of beams",
    ", one can construct different geometries of the lattice .",
    "for the simple cubic lattice , parameters of ( [ originalhamiltonian ] ) can be estimated as @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the recoil energy and @xmath40 note that the ratio @xmath41 is fixed by the ratio of scattering lengths , @xmath42 , for all lattice geometries .",
    "scattering lengths for @xmath0 given in @xcite are @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the bohr radius .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath46 , so the spin dependent part of the interaction is much smaller than the spin independent one . throughout this paper",
    "we will always assume @xmath47 while applying results of this paper for the case of @xmath0 , one should note that errors in the estimation of the exact value of @xmath41 are very big .",
    "while considering the spin structure of mott insulating phases , we will assume that @xmath41 is small enough to see the interplay between tunnelling and spin dependent @xmath48 term before the superfluid - insulator transitions take place .",
    "the positions of superfluid - insulator transitions and the validity of this assumption will be discussed in detail in section [ globalphase diagram ] .",
    "we will use the value @xmath49 to make estimates of various phase boundaries . in fig .",
    "[ tu2 ] we show @xmath50 and @xmath51 as a function of the strength of the optical potential for a three dimensional cubic lattice produced by red detuned lasers with @xmath52 .",
    "superfluid - insulator transition is characterized by a change in fluctuations in particle number on individual lattice sites .",
    "when the spin dependent interaction ( @xmath48 ) is much smaller than the usual hubbard repulsion ( @xmath53 ) , the superfluid - insulator transition is determined mostly by @xmath53 .",
    "the spin gap @xmath48 term , however , is important inside the insulating phase , where it competes with the spin exchange interactions induced by small fluctuations in the particle number , and an interesting spin structure of the insulating states appears as a result of such competition .",
    "the spin structure of the insulating phases of spin-1 bosons in optical lattices will be explored in this paper .    in what follows",
    "we will often find it convenient to use particle creation operators that transform as vectors under spin rotations .",
    "such representation may be constructed as @xmath54 operators @xmath55 satisfy the usual bosonic commutation relations , and they can be used to construct spin operators as @xmath56 we can verify the transformation properties of @xmath55 by noting that @xmath57=[- i e_{apc } a^{\\dagger}_{p}a_{c},a_b]=i e_{abc } a_{c } , \\label{avector1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath58=[- i e_{apc } a^{\\dagger}_{p}a_{c},a^{\\dagger}_b]=i e_{abc } a^{\\dagger}_{c}. \\label{avector2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using these operators the hopping term in the hamiltonian ( [ originalhamiltonian ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath59 and it is invariant under global spin rotations .",
    "we will use this property later to simplify calculations and classify eigenstates of effective interaction by the total spin of two neighboring sites .",
    "we start with the insulating state of the hamiltonian ( [ originalhamiltonian ] ) with an odd number @xmath61 of bosons per site in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "the number of particles on each site is fixed , and the bosonic symmetry of the wave function requires that the spin in each site is odd .",
    "the interaction @xmath48 term is minimized when the spins take the smallest possible value @xmath7 . in this limit",
    "the energy of the system does not depend on the spin orientations on different sites .",
    "when @xmath60 is finite but small , we expect that we still have spin @xmath7 in each site , but that boson tunnelling processes induce effective interactions between these spins . in this section",
    "we will compute such interactions in the lowest ( second ) order in @xmath60 .",
    "we will also discuss conditions for which our effective hamiltonian provides an adequate description of the system .    in the second order perturbation theory in @xmath60 , we generate only pairwise interactions between atoms on neighboring sites , so we can write the most general spin hamiltonian for @xmath7 particles that preserves spin @xmath63 symmetry @xmath64 here @xmath65 labels near neighbor sites on the lattice . absence of the higher order terms , such as @xmath66 follows from the fact that the product of any three spin operators for an @xmath7 particle can be expressed via the lower order terms .    to find the exchange constants @xmath67 , we need to consider virtual processes that create a state with @xmath68 and @xmath69 the difference in energy between the intermediate state and low energy @xmath70 subspace is of order @xmath71 and while our subspace is much lower in energy , the second order perturbation theory is valid .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_n1a ] ) as @xmath72 here @xmath73 is a projection operator for a pair of spins on near neighbor sites @xmath23 and @xmath74 into a state with total spin @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "equivalence of ( [ hamiltonian_n1a ] ) and ( [ hamiltonian_n1b ] ) can be proven by noting simple operator identities for two spin one particles @xmath77 note that states @xmath78 have only the trivial degeneracy corresponding to possible projections of total spin @xmath17 on a fixed quantization axis @xmath79 .",
    "since we know a general form of our effective hamiltonian , we can compute @xmath80 by calculating the expectation values of energy for arbitrary states in the appropriate subspaces @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the energy of the configuration with @xmath83 bosons in each of the two wells , and @xmath84 is the energy of the intermediate ( virtual ) states , @xmath85 , that have @xmath86 and @xmath87 bosons in the two wells , respectively .",
    "both energies should be computed in the zeroth order in @xmath60 .",
    "it is useful to note that the tunnelling hamiltonian is spin invariant ; therefore , intermediate states in @xmath85 summation in ( [ hsecondorder ] ) should also have total spin @xmath17 .",
    "another constraint on the possible states @xmath85 comes from the fact that the tunnelling term can only change the spin on each site by @xmath88 since , in a hilbert space of each well , operators @xmath89 act as vectors , according to their transformational properties ( [ avector1])-([avector2 ] ) .",
    "direct calculations in appendix [ appendixa ] give @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92    combining ( [ hamiltonian_n1b])-([epsilon2 ] ) we find    @xmath93    it will turn out that the ratio between @xmath94 and @xmath95 determines magnetic ground state , and its dependence on @xmath96 is quite fast , as shown in fig . [ j1j2 ] .",
    "we now discuss limitations of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_n1a ] ) with ( [ js ] ) . in the insulating state with exactly one boson per site , near neighbor interactions always have the form ( [ hamiltonian_n1a ] ) .",
    "explicit expressions for the @xmath97 s given in ( [ js ] ) only apply in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath60 becomes comparable to @xmath53 ( but we are still in the insulating phase ) , higher order terms become important , including the possibility of spin coupling beyond the near neighbor sites . in the insulating state with more than one boson per site ( @xmath83 , @xmath98 )",
    ", we have an additional constraint : we should be able to neglect configurations with spins on individual sites higher than @xmath19 .",
    "matrix elements for scattering into such states are of the order of @xmath99 ( see ( [ js ] ) ) , and their energy is set by @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_n1a ] ) applies only when @xmath100 , which is well within the insulating state when @xmath101 ( si transition takes place for @xmath102 ) .",
    "to understand the nature of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_n1a ] ) in the relevant regime of parameters @xmath103 , it is useful to start by considering a two - site problem @xmath104 with @xmath105",
    ". eigenstates of ( [ s=1twosites ] ) can be classified according to the value of the total spin @xmath106 , and their energies may be computed using @xmath107 .",
    "two spin one particles can combine into @xmath108 , @xmath19 , and @xmath109 .",
    ".eigenstates of a two site problem ( [ s=1twosites ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath94 term in ( [ s=1twosites ] ) favors maximizing @xmath110 by making the fully polarized @xmath111 state .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath95 term favors maximizing @xmath112 by forming a singlet state @xmath108 ( see table [ tables=1twosites ] ) .",
    "so , the latter term acts as an effective antiferromagnetic interaction for this spin one system , and it dominates for @xmath113 . if we go beyond a two site problem and consider a large lattice , we see that each pair of near neighbor sites wants to establish a singlet configuration when @xmath114 . however , because one can not form singlets on two different bonds that share the same site , some interesting spin order , whose precise nature will depend on the lattice and dimensionality , will appear .",
    "> from the discussion above we see the conflict intrinsic to the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_n1a ] ) : each bond wants to have a singlet spin configuration , but singlet states on the neighboring bonds are not allowed .",
    "there are two simple ways to resolve this conflict : a ) construct a state that mixes @xmath29 and @xmath30 on each bond but can be repeated on neighboring bonds ; b ) break translational symmetry and favor singlets either on every second bond .    at the mean - field level ,",
    "solution of the type a is given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] one can immediately see that if we try to expand this expression near @xmath220 there is no linear term , but second and third order terms are present , which indicates that by changing the parameters of the hamiltonian , we will have a first order quantum phase transition , at which the value of @xmath213 that minimizes the energy changes discontinuously .",
    "this is typical for ordinary nematics@xcite since in landau expansion third order terms are not forbidden by @xmath221 symmetry .",
    "the reason why our transition is of the first order can be traced back to the fact that mean field energy has terms which mix @xmath222 and @xmath223 in odd powers , i.e. @xmath224 and overall @xmath225 symmetry does nt prohibit odd powers of @xmath213 in ( [ etheta ] ) .    since",
    "phase transition is of the first order , transition is characterized by several regimes .",
    "first , when @xmath60 is small , global energy minimum is at @xmath62 and there are no other local minima , i.e. we have spin singlets in all individual sites .",
    "then , when condition @xmath226 is satisfied , a local minimum appears at @xmath227 see fig .",
    "[ energy1 ] . as we continue increasing @xmath60 ,",
    "the minimum at nonzero @xmath213 becomes deeper , and eventually at @xmath228 the global minimum of ( [ etheta ] ) is reached for @xmath229 ( see fig.[energy2 ] ) .",
    "however , there is still a local minimum at @xmath230 if we keep increasing @xmath60 , the minimum at @xmath231 becomes completely unstable at @xmath232 and there is only one minimum at @xmath233 ( see fig .",
    "[ energy3 ] ) .",
    "as we increase @xmath60 further , @xmath234 continues to grow , approaching the value @xmath235 .",
    "it is useful to point out that when @xmath60 is changed in experiments ( e.g. by changing the strength of the optical potential @xcite ) , we expect that the system will not switch between the singlet and nematic phases at @xmath236 , but will remain in the appropriate metastable local minimum until it becomes completely unstable .",
    "so , in experiments with increasing @xmath60 , the transition from the singlet to the nematic states will occur at @xmath237 , and in experiments with decreasing @xmath60 , the transition from the nematic to the singlet state will take place at @xmath238 .",
    "we note , however , that the difference between different @xmath60 is quite small .",
    "in figure [ n2diagram ] we show the phase diagram for the insulating phase with @xmath10 , including a true first order transition line at @xmath236 and limits of metastability at @xmath238 and @xmath237 .",
    "the superfluid - insulator transition line is shown as an eye guide for the case of small enough @xmath41 ; its exact position will be presented in section [ globalphase diagram ] .",
    "it is useful to point out that in the discussion above we used canonical ensemble ( fixed number of particles ) rather than grand canonical ensemble ( fixed chemical potential ) to discuss the singlet to nematic phase transition .",
    "however , intermediate states that contribute to exchange interactions always involve one particle and one hole .",
    "hence , their energy does not depend on the chemical potential .",
    "this explains why the singlet to nematic phase boundary in figure [ n2diagram ] does not depend on @xmath239 .",
    "it is consistent with our physical intuition that insulating states have a certain number of particles , but their chemical potential @xmath239 is not well defined as long as @xmath239 is inside the mott gap . in the discussion presented in this section , we assumed that the system remains deep in the insulating phase and the superfluid to insulator transition does not preempt the isotropic to nematic transition inside the insulating lobe .",
    "precise conditions under which this is justified will be given in section [ globalphase diagram ] .",
    "for small enough @xmath60 , mean - field analysis of the previous section predicts the singlet ground state that does not depend on @xmath60 .",
    "now we will consider quantum fluctuations near this state to obtain more accurate wave function and excitation spectra .",
    "we can rewrite ( [ abgd ] ) via hubbard operators @xmath240 here @xmath241 and @xmath242 belong to the set @xmath204 .",
    "commutation relations between @xmath243 are very simple : @xmath244=\\delta_{\\beta \\gamma } a_i^{\\alpha \\delta}-\\delta_{\\alpha \\delta}a_i^{\\gamma",

    "since for small enough @xmath60 only a singlet state is occupied in mean field approximation , we can resolve constraint ( [ constr ] ) using analog of holstein - primakoff representation near @xmath251 state @xcite , which is given by @xmath252 now we expand our initial hamiltonian in terms of now independent operators @xmath253 up to the second order : @xmath254 calculation of matrices @xmath255 gives necessary matrix elements @xmath256 @xmath257 @xmath258 @xmath259.\\ ] ] we rewrite our hamiltonian in terms of fourier transforms of @xmath260 : @xmath261 where @xmath262 is classical energy and @xmath263 now we will use canonical bogoliubov transformations to diagonalize this hamiltonian . since most of the terms are diagonal in @xmath264 subspace , it is easy to see that required transformation mixes operators @xmath265 @xmath266 @xmath267 @xmath268 and @xmath269    transformation that mixes the first pair is @xmath270 @xmath271 and complex conjugates . substituting this transformation into ( [ h2k ] ) and requiring that terms with @xmath272 and @xmath273 vanish , we obtain the equation for @xmath274 @xmath275 where @xmath276 @xmath277 energy of this excitation becomes @xmath278    equation ( [ modeenergy ] ) suggests that the first instability appears at @xmath279 and gives the phase boundary that agrees with the metastability line @xmath237 found in the previous subsection .",
    "however , results of the previous subsection suggest that phase transition is of the first order and takes place before the mode softening at @xmath279 .",
    "the first order transition may also be obtained with the formalism presented in this section by noting that expansion of ( [ bosonization ] ) allows third order terms @xmath280 .",
    "we can use similar analysis to discuss excitations with other spin quantum numbers .",
    "for example , excitations with @xmath281 are diagonalized by analogous bogoliubov transformations with @xmath282 and excitations with @xmath283 are diagonalized with transformations with the same @xmath284 as required by the spin symmetry of the singlet state , all of these excitations have the same energy .",
    "now we can discuss the approximations made while expanding over @xmath285 while transformation ( [ bosonization ] ) is the exact resolution of the constraint ( [ constr ] ) , expansion to the second order adds states with higher boson occupation numbers and changes hilbert space ( this is completely analogous to usual antiferromagnet spin - wave theory ) .",
    "however , if _ a posteriori _ we can verify that only states with occupation numbers @xmath286 are present in the ground state , then expansion of the constraint ( [ constr ] ) up to the second order was justified .",
    "the parameter that controls such expansion is @xmath287 calculation of this quantity while the singlet state is still a global maximum for @xmath129 gives numerical values @xmath288 therefore , our expansion is much more precise than for heisenberg antiferromagnet , where this quantity is not much smaller than @xmath19 and one needs the condition @xmath289 to justify the spin wave theory .",
    "now we will consider excitations for the states with nematic order .",
    "for the states described by ( [ s2variationalwavefunction ] ) - ( [ am ] ) , there are no expectation values of the spin operators @xmath290 , but there is a nematic order ( [ nematicq ] ) when @xmath291 .",

    "first , we make unitary transformation in hilbert subspace of each site , which is given by @xmath299 making appropriate transformation on @xmath300 we can write our hamiltonian as @xmath301 where states @xmath202 - @xmath203 belong to the set @xmath302 after that , we proceed exactly as in the previous subsection , expanding near @xmath303 state . since dependance @xmath213 on @xmath304",

    "we note that @xmath10 case also have particular experimental advantage over other filling factors due to the absence of three particle losses and the least restrictive condition on @xmath41 for observation of singlet - nematic transition .",
    "the second approach to experimental detection of singlet and nematic insulating phases relies on the measurement of excitation spectra . as discussed in sections [ spinsingletexcitations ] and [ nematicspinwaves ]",
