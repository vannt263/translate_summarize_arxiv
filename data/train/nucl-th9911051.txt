    "the two - body components of the electroexcitation operator play an important role , particularly for the transverse response at the highest @xmath13-values .",
    "the relative sign between the one- and two - body contributions is consistent with that expected from elastic form factor studies of @xmath1he .",
    "there it is found  @xcite that two - body current ( charge ) operators increase ( decrease ) the ia predictions for the magnetic ( charge ) form factor at @xmath340 @xmath12 .",
    "a feature of the longitudinal @xmath1he data is the presence of an enhancement near threshold .",
    "such an enhancement is particularly pronounced at low @xmath13 .",
    "it is not observed in the @xmath1h longitudinal response  @xcite . at the momentum transfers under consideration here ,",
    "the longitudinal strength is almost entirely due to a @xmath341 transition involving the dominant s - wave component of @xmath1he and the doublet s - wave @xmath0 scattering state .",
    "it has been shown by heimback _",
    "et al . _  @xcite that the enhancement results from the constructive interference of the amplitudes in the two - body breakup of @xmath1he that correspond to the virtual photon coupling directly to a proton or to a correlated proton - neutron pair",
    ". in @xmath1h , the virtual photon for the two - body breakup channel can couple only to the correlated pair , since coupling directly to a proton",
    "leaves an unbound neutron pair and thus a three - body final state .",
    "the present calculations correctly account for this threshold enhancement in the longitudinal response of @xmath1he .",
    "previous calculations , reported on in ref .",
    "@xcite , used either the faddeev equations  @xcite or the orthogonal - correlated - state ( ocs ) method  @xcite to describe the bound and scattering wave functions .",
    "both calculations did not include two - body charge and current operators .",
    "however , the former used the central malfliet - tjon interaction , while the latter was based on a realistic hamiltonian including the older argonne @xmath342 two - nucleon  @xcite and urbana - vii three - nucleon  @xcite interactions .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse response functions are surprisingly well predicted in the threshold region by the faddeev calculation , but are both underestimated , particularly the transverse response , in the ocs calculation .",
    "the latter also fails to reproduce the observed enhancement in longitudinal strength between the two- and three - body breakup thresholds , probably because of the approximate treatment of final - state - interaction effects between the proton and deuteron clusters .",
    "however , in view of the importance of two - body currents ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : res3he ] ) , the agreement between the data and faddeev results is presumably accidental .    finally , in figs .",
    "[ fig : rl - rlt ] and  [ fig : rt - rtt ] we show the @xmath337 , @xmath343 , @xmath338 and @xmath299 response functions at a fixed excitation energy of 1 mev above the @xmath0 threshold in the three - momentum transfer range 05 @xmath12 . in @xmath337 and @xmath343 the s - wave @xmath0 continuum states give the dominant contribution , while in @xmath338 and @xmath299 both s- and p - wave states give equally important contributions over the whole @xmath13 range .",
    "all response functions are substantially affected by two - body currents , however , the sensitivity to these is particularly pronounced for @xmath343 and @xmath299 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : see ] we show the unpolarized cross section , and the @xmath344 and @xmath345 asymmetries in the threshold region at an incident electron energy of 4 gev .",

    "[ fig : res3he][fig : see ] ) , except at the highest @xmath13-values .",
    "the cross section for the chosen kinematics ( incident electron energy of 4 gev , fixed @xmath0 excitation energy of 1 mev , and @xmath346 ) is dominated by the longitudinal response function .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : see ] we also show the plane - wave - impulse - approximation ( pwia ) results .",

    "\\label{eq : psipwia}\\ ] ] the lack of orthogonality between the @xmath348 with @xmath349 @xmath142 and the @xmath350he ground - state wave functions is responsible for the excess cross section at low @xmath13 obtained in pwia with respect to the fullcalculation .",
    "we have reported calculations of @xmath0 radiative capture observables at energies below the three - body breakup threshold , and of longitudinal , transverse and interference response functions measured in polarized electron scattering from polarized @xmath1he in the threshold region for momentum transfers in the range 05 @xmath12 .",
    "these calculations have been based on the argonne @xmath3 two - nucleon  @xcite and urbana - ix three - nucleon  @xcite interactions , and have used accurate bound and continuum wave functions , obtained with the phh method@xcite .",
    "the model for the electromagnetic operator has been taken to consist of one- and two - body components , the latter ones constructed consistently with the two - nucleon interaction  @xcite . in recent studies , this theory has been shown to correctly predict the static properties of the trinucleons  @xcite and @xmath351 nuclei  @xcite , as well as their associated elastic and transition electromagnetic form factors .",
    "a satisfactory description of all measured @xmath0 observables has emerged with the exception of the differential cross section and tensor analyzing power at small angles for @xmath352 kev , and the contributions to the gdh integral at energies in the c.m .",
    "range 053 kev .",
    "a comparison between the calculated rmes and those extracted from fits to the measured data has shown that the large @xmath218 rme associated with the channel @xmath8 is overestimated by theory at very low energy .",
    "it has been speculated that at these energies ( below @xmath353 kev ) long - range electromagnetic interactions beyond the static coulomb repulsion between protons might play a role .",
    "these electromagnetic interactions have already been included in bound - state calculations ( such as those reported here ) , where they have been found to contribute to ground - state energy differences between mirror nuclei or members of isomultiplets  @xcite .",
    "however , they have yet to be included in scattering - state calculations . work along these lines is currently underway .",
    "it should emphasized that at higher energies the splitting between the @xmath219 and @xmath218 rmes appears to be much reduced , as the fits to the @xmath0 observables at 2 mev indicate .",
    "this result is further corroborated by a phase shift analysis of @xmath0 elastic scattering at energies below the @xmath2 breakup threshold  @xcite , which leads to very close values for the @xmath354 and @xmath355 phases . at 2 mev",
    "the tensor observables @xmath196 and @xmath198 are sensitive to the small quartet @xmath356 rmes .",
    "the fullcalculation fails to correctly predict these observables , suggesting that the present model for the electromagnetic transition operator may have deficiencies .",
    "finally , the validity of the long - wavelength approximation has been analyzed .",
    "this approximation has been found to be inadequate for the calculation of inhibited ( and hence small ) electric dipole transitions .",
    "model calculations of low - energy capture and photodisintegration observables , based on the long - wavelength form of the @xmath7 operator ( the lwac operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lw1me ] ) ) , should therefore be viewed with suspicion unless explicitely verifying that higher order corrections are indeed negligible .",
    "the body of data available from @xmath1he(@xmath339 ) inclusive scattering experiments in the threshold region is not as extensive , at present , as that from @xmath0 capture experiments .",
    "however , polarized electron scattering data from a polarized @xmath1he target below the @xmath2 threshold should become available in the near future  @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse data measured at bates by the saskatoon group are in reasonable agreement with theory , although the data have rather large errors . the crucial role played by two - body charge and current operators should be re - emphasized .",
