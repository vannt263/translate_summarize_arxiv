    "vo@xmath0 belongs to transition metal compounds which exhibit metal - insulator transitions @xcite . at @xmath5=340",
    "k , vo@xmath0 undergoes a phase transition from a semiconductor with monoclinic structure to a metal with the tetragonal rutile structure .",
    "the nature of the ground - state semiconducting phase is still rather uncertain . in the semiconducting phase ,",
    "the v atoms are paired which was a reason for the suggestion that the electron - phonon interaction is responsible for the splitting of the @xmath6-band and the opening of a band gap @xcite .",
    "this idea is supported by band structure calculations according to which the crystallographic phase transition can be explained by the formation of a charge - density wave accompanied by a lattice distortion and a subsequent condensation of phonons @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , there is enough energy gain to account for the metal - insulator transition through structural distortions that permits a strengthening of the vanadium @xmath6@xmath6 bonds and a reorganization of the states near the fermi level .    on the other hand ,",
    "some calculations indicate that a crystallographic distortion is not sufficient to open up a gap , and that the electron - correlation effects play an important role in the transition @xcite .",
    "it was concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite that the energy gap in vo@xmath0 is of the charge - transfer type rather than of the mott ",
    "hubbard type as in the late transition metal compounds , like nio and cuo @xcite .",
    "in addition to earlier spectroscopic studies @xcite , the photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and low - energy electron diffraction studies on vo@xmath0 have been carried out recently in ref .",
    "the present work aims at a combined experimental study of the electronic structure of a vo@xmath0 single crystal at room temperature by the use of high - energy spectroscopies .",
    "a high - resolution x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) provides information about the total density of states ( dos ) in the valence band ( vb ) ; v@xmath1 ( the @xmath7 transition ) , v@xmath2 ( the @xmath8 transition ) , o@xmath3 ( the @xmath9 transition ) x - ray emission ( xes ) vb spectra ( excited by both electrons and photons ) probe the v@xmath10 , v@xmath11 and o@xmath12 partial dos in the valence band ; the o@xmath4 total electron yield spectrum probes the o@xmath12 unoccupied states .",
    "band structure calculations are performed and compared with the experimental spectra leading to the conclusion that the electronic structure of vo@xmath0 is more bandlike than correlated .",
    "the xps measurements have been carried out with a phi 5600 ci multitechnique spectrometer using monochromatized aluminium @xmath3 radiation with a full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.3 ev .",
    "the energy resolution of the analyzer was 1.5% of the pass energy .",
    "we estimate an energy resolution of about 0.35 ev for the xps measurements on vo@xmath0 . the base pressure in the vacuum chamber during the measurements was @xmath13 torr .",
    "all of the experiments presented in this paper have been performed at room temperature with the same single crystal of vo@xmath0 ( @xmath14 mm ) .",
    "initial measurements were performed without cleaving the crystal , and hence a high contamination of carbon was detected on the surface . therefore the final measurements were done on a surface that was cleaved _ in vacuo_.",
    "thus an excellent surface with a relatively small amount of defects and contaminations could be obtained , and hence the intrinsic properties of the samples could be studied . for the comparison",
    ", xps measurements of pure v metal ( single crystal ) were also performed .",
    "all xps spectra were calibrated using the au @xmath15 signal from an au foil [ @xmath16 = 84.0 ev ] .",
    "electron excited v@xmath1-emission spectra ( the @xmath17 transition ) of vo@xmath18 were recorded using an rsm-500 spectrometer with a diffraction grating ( @xmath19=600 lines / mm ; @xmath20=6 m ) .",
    "the accelerating voltage and current on the x - ray tube were @xmath21=4.4 kev and @xmath22=0.3 ma .",
    "the energy resolution was 0.4 ev .",
    "v@xmath23-spectra ( the @xmath8 transition ) of vo@xmath0 were measured using a fluorescent johan - type vacuum spectrometer with a position - sensitive detector @xcite .",
    "cu@xmath3 x - ray radiation from the sealed x - ray tube was used for excitation for the fluorescent v@xmath23 xes .",
    "a quartz crystal ( rhombohedral plane , second order reflection ) curved to @xmath20=1.8 m was used as an analyzer .",
    "the spectra were measured with an energy resolution @xmath24=0.22 ev .",
    "energy - selective excited o@xmath3- ( the @xmath9 transition ) , v@xmath1-spectra ( the @xmath17 transition ) were measured as well as x - ray absorption spectra ( the v@xmath12- and o@xmath4-edges ) in the sample drain - current mode .",
    "these measurements were performed at the undulator beam line bw3 at hasylab hamburg , germany @xcite , equipped with a modified sx-700 monochromator .",
    "the soft x - ray emission spectra were recorded at various excitation energies in the first order of diffraction with a resolution of about 0.7 ev .",
    "we used a grazing - incidence grating spectrometer @xcite with an @xmath20=5 m spherical grating with 1200 lines / mm in a rowland circle geometry .",
    "the resolution of the excitation radiation was set to about 1 ev by opening the exit slit of the monochromator to 400 @xmath25 m .",
    "the spectrometer had solid angle acceptance of about @xmath26 sr , so that with a spot size of some @xmath27 @xmath25 m at a distance of 5 cm from the entrance slit of the spectrometer we registered a maximum of about 300 counts / minute in the v@xmath1 line at 100 ma ring current . in order to obtain a reasonable statistical accuracy",
    ", we had to acquire for 120 to 240 minutes per single spectrum , depending on the excitation energy .",
    "the angle between the incident x - ray beam and the detection direction was 90@xmath28 .",
    "this minimized the elastic scattering into the spectrometer , because the polarization of the beam coincided with the detection direction .",
    "the v@xmath12 and o@xmath4 absorption spectra had energy resolution of 0.2 ev for an exit slit width of 80 @xmath25 m .",
    "no special surface preparation was undertaken for these measurements .",
    "the band - structure calculations were carried out by the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital method ( tb - lmto ) in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) @xcite , with the use of the exchange - correlation potential as parametrized by von barth and hedin @xcite and gradient corrections as proposed by langreth and mehl @xcite on top of the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "since both rutile and monoclinic structures of vo@xmath0 are relatively loosely packed , it was necessary to include empty spheres in the asa calculations . for the tetragonal rutile phase , we used the crystal structure parameters @xmath29=4.5546 , @xmath30=0.626 and @xmath31=0.300 as given in ref .",
    "besides two formula units of vo@xmath0 , our unit cell included eight equivalent empty spheres , which form long chains parallel to the linear o - v - o fragments , separating the latter .",
    "due to the difference between the v and o atomic sphere radii , the chains are slightly bent .",
    "our choice of the sphere radii @xmath32 , based on the attainability of good matching between the potential at the v and o atomic spheres compatible with a radial sphere overlap below 25% of all interatomic distances , was : @xmath32(v)=2.702 a.u . ;",
    "@xmath32(o)=1.762 a.u . ; @xmath32(empty spheres)=1.619 a.u . the calculated band structure and the total dos are rather close to those obtained earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite by different methods .",
    "we performed our own calculation because no data on the partial dos , that are necessary for the discussion of the xes , were available from the previous calculations .",
    "our calculated total dos for the rutile phase of vo@xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , upper panel .    as is usual in oxides , the valence band is formed by hybridized transition metal @xmath10 and o@xmath12 states .",
    "the band gap of 0.9 ev within the valence band separates the regions where o@xmath12 states ( below the gap ) and v@xmath10 states ( above the gap ) dominate .",
    "the fermi level crosses the upper subband , revealing a metallic behaviour of vo@xmath0 , as consistent with the results of other calculations done for the rutile - type structure @xcite . the o@xmath33-related subband ( which experiences some hybridization with the v@xmath10 and v@xmath11 states ) lies separately at about 20 ev below the fermi level .",
    "the overall shape of the band structure and of the total dos obtained in our calculation is in agreement with earlier results @xcite ; the width of the gap within the valence band is somewhat larger than 0.62 ev as obtained in the full potential linear augmented plane wave calculation of ref .",
    "the gap width of 4.6 ev reported in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to be too large ( probably due to the use of the slater exchange potential ) and not in agreement with the experimental positioning of individual subbands , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite or found in the present paper .",
    "since the room - temperature phase ( for @xmath34c ) of vo@xmath0 is monoclinic , the relevant comparison with experiment needs the calculation data for the latter structure .",
    "the monoclinic unit cell contains four formula units of vo@xmath0 , and , because of the large number of atoms and low symmetry , only few calculations have been done by now .",
    "an earlier non - self - consistent calculation @xcite reproduces an experimentally observable semiconductor band gap , but otherwise seems to be very inaccurate in describing the overall structure of the valence band . the analysis of the structure transformation by means of _ ab  initio _ molecular dynamics in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the monoclinic phase has lower energy than the rutile phase , and the equilibrium positions of the atoms are in good agreement with the experimental determination .",
    "however , the strength of the tendency for opening a gap within the valence band is underestimated within the lda , and the flat bands in the vicinity of the fermi level do not separate completely ( see , e.g. , fig . 3 of ref .",
    "this is also the case in our calculation , which we have carried out for the experimental monoclinic structure as specified in ref .",
    "the change from rutile to monoclinic structure gives rise to a broadening of o@xmath12 and v@xmath10 bands by @xmath350.2 ev and to more pronounced splitting in the v@xmath10 states of @xmath36 symmetry .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was shown that the inclusion of electron - phonon interaction ( in the periodic shell model , based on the results of discrete - variational x@xmath37 cluster calculation ) leads to the opening of the band gap .",
    "according to our calculation , the distortion of the nested bands due to the displacement of the atoms in the doubled - cell monoclinic structure gives rise to only small changes in the partial dos , as compared to the rutile structure .",
    "technically , the calculation deals with two inequivalent oxygen species and three inequivalent types of lattice - packing empty spheres of different sizes making a total of 24 sites .",
    "our calculated total dos for the monoclinic structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , lower panel , and some partial dos are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] . for comparison with xes",
    ", we did not distinguish the data for two oxygen species and show the averaged o@xmath33 and o@xmath12 dos over all sites in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , lowest panel .",
    "the densities of states are plotted for the @xmath38 mesh over the brillouin zone .",
    "= 12.5 cm      the intensity distribution of the vb xps spectra reflects the total dos of the vb , up to the deviations due to different atomic photoionization cross - sections .",
    "the results of the xps measurements of single crystal vo@xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] and in the table 1 .",
    "= 12.0 cm    the spectral measurements on the uncleaved crystal show a large contamination with carbon .",
    "this leads to a smearing of the fine structure in the entire valence band , a broadening of subbands and the appearance of an additional subband around 1214 ev which we attribute to transitions from c@xmath33 states .    in the xps spectra of the cleaved vo@xmath0 crystal ,",
    "a distinct narrow peak is observed around 1 ev below the fermi level , which , according to the results of our band structure calculations ( see fig .  [ fig_2 ] ) , has v@xmath10 character .",
    "the fwhm of this peak is about 1 ev which is less than obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    core level ( band ) & binding energy ( ev ) & fwhm ( ev ) + v@xmath33 & 630.02 & 6.10 + o@xmath4 & 529.75 & 1.30 + v@xmath39 & 523.48 & 2.56 + v@xmath40 & 515.95 & 2.04 + v@xmath41 & 68.95 & 4.54 + v@xmath42 & 40.53 & 4.24 + o@xmath33 & 21.73 & 2.5 + o@xmath12 & & + v@xmath10 & 1.03 & +    the next subband has a two - peak structure at 39 ev below the fermi level which are mainly due to the o@xmath12 states ( _ cf . _",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "another reason for reaching this conclusion is that the energy difference between the centre of gravity of this band and the next one ( located at 22 ev ) is about 15 ev , which is in good agreement with the energy separation between o@xmath12 and o@xmath33 bands found in all vanadium oxides @xcite .",
    "however , since the o@xmath12 and v@xmath10 atomic photoionization cross - sections for al@xmath3 excitation  @xcite have a ratio of about 1:2 , one may expect some contribution of v@xmath10 states in this band .",
    "this is also confirmed by our band structure calculation and by the results from the v@xmath1-emission measurements ( see below ) .",
    "we point out , however , that there is a contradiction between the xps and the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra ( ups ) of vo@xmath0 given in refs .",
    "@xcite with respect to energy resolution and the intensity ratio of the two peaks .",
    "the peaks are well - resolved in our measurements , and both their energy separation and the intensity ratio are in good agreement with results of our band structure calculations .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , charge - transfer satellites are found in the ups of scf@xmath43 , tio@xmath0 and v@xmath0o@xmath44 in the region from 11 to 17 ev below the top of the valence band . from the resonant photoemission measurements",
    "it was concluded that the charge - transfer - type configuration manifests itself in such a way as to form a valence state in the ground state in addition to the originally filled @xmath12 state ligand .",
    "on the basis of this experimental evidence , cluster calculations of the valence photoemission and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectra of vo@xmath0 were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was concluded that vo@xmath0 belongs to the group of charge - transfer insulators .",
    "however , we point out that our xps measurements of the uncleaved and cleaved vo@xmath0 single crystal ( fig .  [ fig_3 ] ) strongly suggest that the appearance of this structure ( 14 - 15 ev below the fermi level ) is connected with carbon contamination and that its origin is c@xmath33 states .",
    "a similar problem was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in connection with the analysis of ups spectra of superconducting cuprates .",
    "there , it was concluded that the satellites with binding energies of about 10 ev are generically connected with contaminations of light elements and disappear after cleaning .",
    "therefore we have found a clear indication that the structure in question is not an intrinsic feature of the electronic structure of pure vo@xmath0 and can not be considered as an evidence of correlation effects in vo@xmath0 .",
    "= 11.0 cm    the xps core level spectra of vo@xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] .",
    "the energy positions of the o@xmath4 , v@xmath12 and v@xmath42 spectra of vo@xmath0 are close to those of ref .",
    "@xcite , but the fwhm s of the lines in these spectra ( see table 1 ) are much smaller than it was found in refs .",
    "the lineshapes are clearly asymmetric due to a structure seen at the high - binding energy side . in case of @xmath12 and @xmath42 levels this may be related to @xmath45 multiplets , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the v@xmath42 spectrum",
    ". it should be noted , however , that in our measurements the v@xmath42 lineshape is somewhat different from that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . in case of v@xmath41 level",
    ", the additional structure may be due to the exchange interaction of a ( spin - up or spin - down ) 3@xmath46 electron left in the final state with the ( v@xmath10 ) electrons in the valence band@xcite .    in . fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] , the v@xmath12 , v@xmath41 and v@xmath42 xps core level spectra of vo@xmath0 are compared with those of pure vanadium metal .",
    "evidently , there is a chemical shift of the core level spectra of vo@xmath0 with respect to that of pure metal not only for the v@xmath12 xps - line , but also for the v@xmath41 and v@xmath42 xps - lines .",
    "the fact that the formal charge of the vanadium atom affects v@xmath41 and v@xmath42 lines in an uniform way can be used for an estimation of the oxidation state of the v atom in compounds .",
    "recently , the same conclusion was found for the mn@xmath41 xps - spectra of manganese complexes in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "earlier , we have shown that the analysis of @xmath41 xps - spectra can be used to draw conclusions about the electronic structure of @xmath10 metal oxides @xcite .",
    "it has been found that @xmath41 xps - spectra of nio have a very complicated fine structure due to charge - transfer processes . in this case",
    ", an electron may be transferred from the ligand to a metal @xmath10-level after the emission process , and both states , the screened and unscreened one , are visible in the @xmath41 spectrum .",
    "the simpler fine structure of the v@xmath41 xps - spectrum in vo@xmath0 can be considered as an evidence for negligible charge transfer , again indicating that the electronic structure of this compound is more bandlike than correlated .",
    "x - ray emission valence spectra result from electron transitions between the valence - band and a core hole .",
    "since the wave function of a core electron is strongly localized and its angular momentum symmetry is well defined , these spectra reflect the site - projected and symmetry - restricted ( in accordance with the dipole selection rules ) partial dos . in the case of vo@xmath0",
    ", we have investigated v@xmath1- ( @xmath47 transition ) , vk@xmath48- ( @xmath8 transition ) and o@xmath3-emission spectra ( @xmath9 transition ) which reflect the distribution of v@xmath49 , v@xmath11 and o@xmath12 partial dos . by xps",
    "we can measure the binding energies of the v@xmath12 and the o@xmath4 core levels so that we can determine the position of the fermi level in the x - ray emission spectra .",
    "the o@xmath3 and v@xmath1 spectra , adjusted in such a way as to have a a common energy scale with the x - ray photoemission spectrum , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] .",
    "the v@xmath2 spectrum is positioned with respect to xps by matching the position of the peak which results from the hybridization with o@xmath33 states . in the same figure , the partial dos as calculated for the monoclinic phase and broadened with an energy - dependent lorentzian linewidth according to ref .",
    "@xcite are shown .",
    "calculated and broadened partial dos have been rigidly shifted with respect to the fermi energy ( arbitrarily , but by the same value for all spectra ) to account for a systematic error in the energy matching of the measured spectra and calculated dos due to , e.g. , the absense of the band gap in the calculation .",
    "as is seen , the main maximum of the o@xmath3 spectrum ( o@xmath12 states ) is placed near the top of the valence band , that is quite common in oxides , and is essentially nonbonding .",
    "a corresponding feature is also seen in the xps but merely as a shoulder at 4 ev , due to a smaller value of o@xmath12 photoionization cross section as compared to v@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "xps vb fine sructure with two peaks at 5.4 and 7.5 ev reveals the o@xmath12v@xmath10 bonding band , which overlaps in energy with the maximum of the v@xmath1 spectrum and with a high - binding energy hump of the o@xmath3 spectrum .",
    "= 12.0 cm    we have excited o@xmath3 emission at two excitation energies ( @xmath50=530.8 and 532.2 ev ) which correspond to the maxima of o@xmath4 x - ray absorption spectrum ( xas ) , but found only little difference . the v@xmath1-emission spectrum has been obtained with both electron and photon excitation , that resulted in different intensity distributions ( curves 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] ) . with electron excitation at @xmath50=4.4 kev ( curve 1 )",
    ", we have simultaneous excitation of v@xmath1 ( @xmath17 ) and v@xmath51-emission ( @xmath52 ) which are separated by only 7.53 ev",
    ". therefore there is an overlap of the high - energy subband of v@xmath1 xes with the main peak of the v@xmath51-emission spectrum . for an excitation energy @xmath50=519.0 ev ( curve 2 )",
    ", we selectively excite v@xmath1 which follows electron transitions from the occupied part of the v@xmath10 band . from these data",
    "one can conclude that there is a considerable admixture of v@xmath10 states in the o@xmath12-like bands , so that the maximum emission comes from the v@xmath10o@xmath12 hybridized band and not from an only slightly populated v@xmath10 band .",
    "we find that the fine structure and energy position of the subbands of the v@xmath1-emission spectrum are in reasonable agreement with the calculated v@xmath10 partial dos distribution given in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "the v@xmath2-emission spectrum has two main subbands whose energy positions are very close to the o@xmath12 and the o@xmath33 bands due to v@xmath11o@xmath12 and v@xmath11o@xmath33 hybridization ( see fig .  [ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "the splitting of the main subband of the v@xmath2-emission spectrum also follows the calculated v@xmath11 dos distribution in this energy region .",
    "it is seen that the admixture of the v@xmath11 states to the v@xmath10 band is too small to be detected in the v@xmath2 xes of vo@xmath0 .",
    "the disagreement by @xmath352 ev between spectra ( xps ; v@xmath2 ) and calculated dos in what regards the position of the o@xmath33 states is known in oxides .",
    "it is related to the fact that the hole relaxation , which effectively increases the binding energy of an electron leaving a comparatively localized state such as o@xmath33 , is not taken into account in our band structure calculations which describe the ground state but not excitations .",
