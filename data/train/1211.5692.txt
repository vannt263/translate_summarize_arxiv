    "examples of complete minimal surfaces properly embedded in @xmath4 have been extensively studied and the literature contains a plethora of nontrivial ones . in this paper we focus on complete embedded examples , not necessarily proper , which are invariant by either a vertical translation or a hyperbolic or parabolic screw motion . some examples with these properties , but all of them properly embedded , have been constructed in  @xcite .",
    "the key examples contained in this paper are complete minimal disks embedded in @xmath1 that are non - proper and invariant by a vertical translation and a hyperbolic screw motion , we call them helicoidal - scherk examples . the importance of such helicoidal - scherk examples is twofold in understanding the behaviour of minimal surfaces in @xmath0 .    in addition to being non - proper , a significant feature of these examples is that they have finite total curvature in the quotient of @xmath0 by the vertical translation or the hyperbolic screw motion . in  @xcite toubiana",

    "moreover , in the same paper they also show that a complete embedded minimal surface with finite total curvature in the quotient of @xmath2 by a translation or a screw - motion must be proper .",
    "our examples highlight a much different behaviour in @xmath1 .",
    "recently , collin , hauswirth and rosenberg have studied the conformal type and the geometry of the ends of properly embedded minimal surfaces with finite total curvature in the quotient of @xmath1 by a vertical translation  @xcite .",
    "our main examples are related to but not included in their study .",
    "the same examples are also of interest in relation to the calabi - yau conjectures for embedded minimal surfaces  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "colding and minicozzi showed that a complete minimal surface embedded in @xmath2 with finite topology is proper .",
    "see  @xcite for a generalization of their result .",
    "our helicoidal - scherk examples show that colding and minicozzi s result does not hold in @xmath4 .",
    "note that in  @xcite coskunuzer has already constructed a complete embedded disk in @xmath5 which is not proper , thus showing that colding and minicozzi s result does not generalize to @xmath5 .",
    "the techniques that we use to construct our examples are completely different from his .",
    "the helicoidal - scherk examples are constructed in the next section . in the other sections",
    "we further generalize the construction and also give examples of properly embedded minimal surfaces that are invariant by a parabolic screw motion .",
    "these latter examples are included in the study in  @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank laurent hauswirth and harold rosenberg for very helpful conversations .",
    "in order to construct our examples we consider the poincar disk model of @xmath6 ; i.e. @xmath7 with the hyperbolic metric @xmath8 we denote by @xmath9 the boundary at infinity of @xmath6 and by @xmath10 the origin of @xmath6 .",
    "we use @xmath11 for the coordinate in @xmath12 .",
    "finally , given any two points @xmath13 , we will denote by @xmath14 the geodesic arc joining them .",

    "let @xmath18 be the region bounded by the ideal geodesic triangle with vertices @xmath19 and @xmath20 and edges @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "by theorem  4.9 in  @xcite , there exists a minimal graph over @xmath18 with boundary values @xmath24 over @xmath21 , @xmath25 over @xmath22 and @xmath26 over @xmath23 , for any constant @xmath27 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we call this graph the fundamental piece . using schwarz reflection principle , after considering successive symmetries with respect to the horizontal geodesics contained in the boundary of such a graph , namely @xmath28 , we obtain a simply - connected minimal surface @xmath29 with boundary the vertical line @xmath30 and invariant by the vertical translation @xmath31 by @xmath32 and by the hyperbolic screw motion @xmath33 obtained by composing the rotation by angle @xmath34 around @xmath10 and the vertical translation by @xmath35 . after reflecting across the line @xmath36 , we obtain a simply - connected complete minimal surface @xmath37 invariant by both the vertical translation @xmath31 and the hyperbolic screw motion @xmath33 .",
    "we call these surfaces _ helicoidal - scherk examples_.    we observe that if we consider @xmath38 in this construction , we obtain a scherk graph over a symmetric ideal polygonal domain , see  @xcite .    as a consequence of the gauss - bonnet theorem applied on a fundamental piece ( see  @xcite for a similar argument ) , @xmath37 has finite total curvature in its quotient by both @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",
    "we next show that @xmath37 is embedded .",
    "let us denote by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , the domain obtained by rotating @xmath18 around the origin by an angle @xmath41 so that @xmath42 , and let @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the closure of @xmath39 .",
    "note that the domain @xmath45 can also be obtained by reflecting @xmath39 across the origin .",

    "let @xmath47 be the reflection across the origin of @xmath48 and @xmath49 . recall that @xmath50 consists of a graph with boundary values @xmath24 over @xmath21 , @xmath25 over @xmath22 and @xmath26 over @xmath23 , together with its vertical translates by the vector @xmath51 , @xmath52 . by construction , since we have reflected an even number of times , @xmath53 consists of a union of graphs with boundary values @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the reflection of @xmath56 across @xmath30 instead consists of a union of graphs with boundary values @xmath57 with @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , @xmath58 consists of the reflected fundamental piece together with its vertical translates by the vector @xmath59 , @xmath52 .",
    "in particular @xmath60 is embedded . repeating",
    "this argument proves that @xmath37 is embedded .",
    "observe that the previous argument also shows that we can consider the quotient of @xmath37 by @xmath61 , obtaining a non - orientable complete non - proper embedded minimal surface .",
    "finally we remark that @xmath62 accumulates to @xmath63 , and therefore @xmath37 is a simply - connected ( in particular , with finite topology ) minimal surface embedded in @xmath1 which is complete but not proper .",
    "let us now describe a generalization of these examples .",
    "instead of considering a geodesic triangle , let @xmath18 be the region bounded by an ideal geodesic polygon constructed in the following way .",
    "as before , let @xmath15 and @xmath16 and let @xmath64 denote the shortest arc in @xmath65 with end points @xmath66 . in this construction ,",
    "the geodesics @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the same but , instead of connecting the two with the geodesic @xmath23 , we consider @xmath67 points @xmath68 , cyclically ordered in @xmath64 .",
    "we define @xmath18 as the region bounded by the ideal geodesic polygon with vertices @xmath69 and @xmath20 . assuming that @xmath18 satisfies the jenkins - serrin condition of theorem  4.9 in  @xcite , we can find a graph over @xmath18 with boundary values @xmath24 on @xmath70 , @xmath27 on @xmath71 and alternating @xmath72 on the remaining geodesic arcs @xmath73 , @xmath74 ,  , @xmath75 , @xmath76 . after considering successive symmetries with respect to the horizontal and vertical geodesics contained in the boundary of such a graph",
    ", we obtain a simply - connected complete embedded minimal surface in @xmath0 invariant by the same vertical translation @xmath31 and the same hyperbolic screw motion @xmath33 previously defined . again",
    ", this surface is non - proper and has finite total curvature when considered in the quotient by @xmath31 or @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , it admits a non - orientable quotient by the vertical translation given by the vector @xmath61 .",
    "we also refer to such examples as _ helicoidal - scherk examples_.    it is easy to show that the class of these more general examples is rather large .",
    "here is an easy way to construct domains as previously described .",
    "if for @xmath77 , we let @xmath78 , then we recover the symmetric helicoidal - scherk examples for a smaller choice of @xmath25 , by the generalized maximum principle for such minimal graphs ( see  ( * ? ? ? *",
    "theorem 2 ) or  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.13 ) ) .",
    "however , after slightly perturbing one such @xmath79 , we would obtain a domain satisfying the jenkins - serrin condition of theorem  4.9 in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we observe that when @xmath80 and @xmath81 is any point in @xmath64 then the jenkins - serrin condition is satisfied .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the importance of these examples is twofold .",
    "* in  @xcite toubiana proved that a complete embedded minimal annulus with finite total curvature in the quotient of @xmath2 by a translation must the quotient of a helicoid . in  @xcite meeks and",
    "rosenberg proved that toubiana s result holds if the translation is replaced by a screw - motion .",
    "moreover , in the same paper they also show that a complete embedded minimal surface with finite total curvature in the quotient of @xmath2 by a translation or a screw - motion must be proper .",
    "our examples highlight a much different behaviour in @xmath1 . * in  @xcite , colding and",
    "minicozzi showed that a complete minimal surface embedded in @xmath2 with finite topology is proper . thus showing that the calabi - yau conjectures hold for complete minimal surfaces embedded in @xmath2 , see  @xcite .",
    "our helicoidal - scherk examples show that colding and minicozzi s result does not hold in @xmath0 .",
    "note that in  @xcite coskunuzer has already constructed a complete embedded disk in @xmath5 which is not proper , thus showing that colding and minicozzi s result does not generalize to @xmath5 .",
    "the techniques that we have used to construct the helicoidal - scherk examples are completely different from his .",
    "note also that in  @xcite , meeks and rosenberg generalized the result in  @xcite to complete minimal surfaces with positive injectivity radius and , among other things , showed that the closure of a complete minimal surface with positive injectivity radius embedded in a 3-manifold has the structure of a minimal lamination .",
    "the closure of a helicoidal - scherk example is the minimal lamination given by the union of such helicoidal - scherk example with the related totally geodesic vertical planes .",
    "let us now consider @xmath15 and @xmath82 , with @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the region bounded by @xmath84 and @xmath64 , see figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "by theorem 4.9 in @xcite , there exists a minimal graph over @xmath18 with boundary values @xmath24 over @xmath70 , @xmath25 over @xmath71 and @xmath85 over @xmath64 , for any @xmath27 and any continuous function @xmath85 on @xmath64 ( in fact , finitely many points of discontinuity for @xmath85 are allowed ) .",
    "again , after considering successive symmetries with respect to the horizontal geodesics contained in the boundary of such a graph , we get a minimal surface @xmath86 bounded by the vertical line @xmath30 and invariant by the vertical translation @xmath31 by @xmath87 and by the hyperbolic screw motion @xmath33 obtained by composition of the rotation by angle @xmath88 around @xmath10 and the vertical translation by @xmath35 . considering a final symmetry with respect to @xmath30",
    ", we obtain a simply - connected complete minimal surface @xmath89 which is invariant by the vertical translation @xmath31 and by the hyperbolic screw motion @xmath33 .",
    "we call these surfaces _ helicoidal examples_. these examples have infinite total curvature in the quotient , since their normal vectors do not become horizontal when we approach points in @xmath90 ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) ) .",
    "let us show that @xmath91 is embedded when @xmath92 is even and , if @xmath85 satisfies certain conditions , when @xmath92 is odd .",
    "using the same notation as in the previous section , we know that @xmath93 consists of the union of the minimal graph with boundary values @xmath94 where @xmath95 together with its vertical translates by the vector @xmath96 , @xmath52 .",
    "the reflection of @xmath97 across @xmath30 instead consists of the graph with boundary values @xmath98 together with its vertical translates by the vector @xmath96 , @xmath52 .",
    "hence , using the general maximum principle for minimal graphs  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.16 ) , we get that @xmath99 is embedded when @xmath92 is even or when @xmath92 is odd and @xmath100 by symmetry , @xmath91 is embedded under the same conditions .    from the argument above we deduce that , when @xmath92 is even , @xmath101 consists of the reflected fundamental piece together with its vertical translates by the vector @xmath102 , @xmath52 . thus @xmath91 admits also a non - orientable quotient by @xmath103 .    in the case",
    "@xmath92 is even , if we consider the sequence of functions @xmath104 , where @xmath105 over @xmath64 , then we obtain the fundamental piece of the corresponding symmetric helicoidal - scherk example as a limit of the fundamental piece of @xmath106 and thus @xmath107 as a limit of the sequence of surfaces @xmath108 .",
    "we could take another choice of functions @xmath109 with the same limit",
    "but in such a way that each @xmath106 has a smooth boundary .",
    "in fact , any helicoidal - scherk example can be recovered as a limit of some sequence @xmath108 of helicoidal examples , by choosing appropriate functions @xmath109 .",
    "finally , observe that if we consider @xmath110 , with @xmath111 , we recover one of the helicoids given by nelli and rosenberg in  @xcite , congruent to the euclidean one .",
    "in fact , by varying @xmath27 we re - obtain all of their examples .",
    "hence the family of helicoidal examples contains the helicoids .",
