    "an iron - based superconductor was first discovered in the lafeaso system with a so - called zrcusias - type structure whose superconductivity is induced by partial substitution of flourine for oxygen.@xcite after this discovery , the development of new materials with an fe layer in which the superconductivity is considered to appear , have been performed , resulting in the discoveries of other iron - based superconductors , such as the so - called 122 system,@xcite fese@xmath9te@xmath10,@xcite lifeas,@xcite and so on . on the other hand , new superconductors with a zrcusias - type structure which consist of elements other than fe are also explored , for example , la@xmath9sr@xmath10niaso@xcite .",
    "recently , mizoguchi and his collaborators have discovered the superconductivity in ceni@xmath0bi@xmath1 with a superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 4.2  k.@xcite    series compounds cembi@xmath1 and cemsb@xmath1 have zrcusias - type structures with space group of @xmath11 corresponding to the so - called 1111 system , where m is a transition metal element such as mn , fe , ni , cu , ag , and so on.@xcite for cembi@xmath1 , bi1 , m , ce and bi2 sites correspond to as , fe , rare earth element and o sites , respectively .",
    "the `` parent '' compound of ceni@xmath0bi@xmath1 , cenibi@xmath1 is a moderately heavy fermion antiferromagnet ; magnetic ordering appears at about 5  k and the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath12 is relatively large ( 470  mj / k@xmath13 mol).@xcite this parent compound does not exhibit a superconductivity although the electric conductivity is metallic down to the lowest temperature.@xcite    the superconductivity is induced by the deficiency of ni atom,@xcite as the superconductivity in the iron - based superconductor of the so - called 1111 system is induced by oxygen - deficiency.@xcite the resistivity and superconducting shielding signal in the magnetic field show the superconducting transition at about 4.2  k. at about 5  k , specific heat @xmath14 exhibits a jump of @xmath154  j / k mol . this jump may be attributed to the magnetic ordering of the ce 4@xmath8 moment because the entropy estimated by an integration of @xmath16 below 5  k corresponds with @xmath17ln2 , which is expected from the twofold degenerated ground state of the ce 4@xmath8 electron .",
    "the clear jump of the specific heat is not observed at around @xmath6 because the jump caused by the superconducting transition is much smaller than the jump caused by the magnetic ordering , suggesting that the charge carrier which causes the superconductivity is not coupled with the ce 4@xmath8 electron and the mass is not enhanced.@xcite    if the ce 4@xmath8 electron is coupled with the superconducting carrier in the present compound , the magnetic fluctuation of 4@xmath8 electron can induce the unconventional superconducting order parameter . in such a case , temperature dependence of the magnetic bragg peak should have some anomaly at @xmath6 .",
    "then we have performed powder neutron diffraction measurements on ceni@xmath0bi@xmath1 in order to investigate the existence of the coupling between the ce 4@xmath8 electron and the superconducting carrier .",
    "first , we present the structural parameters determined by rietveld analysis in sec .",

    "6 is based on the present result . in sec .",
    "iiib , we report the magnetic structure and the temperature dependence of the ordered moment of the ce 4@xmath8 moment .",
    "our results suggest that the ce 4@xmath8 electron does not contribute to the superconductivity in this compound , consistent with the suggestion in ref .",
    "for the compound of ceni@xmath10bi@xmath1 , we found through a series of synthesis experiments that samples synthesized by conventional solid state reaction have a constant ni - deficiency of x=0.8.@xcite a powder sample of ceni@xmath0bi@xmath1 for the present neutron measurements was prepared by following method .",
    "ce , ni and bi powders with a nominal composition of ceni@xmath0bi@xmath1 were used as starting materials .",
    "the mixed powder was evacuated in a silica tube and heated at 500  for 10 h and 750  20 h. the obtained powder was ground and pressed into pellets , and it was heated 800  for 10 h in the evacuated silica tube . inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) spectroscopy was used to confirm the chemical composition , ceni@xmath0bi@xmath1 , which was consistent with the nominal composition .",
    "the sample appears stable thermally in a dry box or an evacuated glass tube , but decomposes in an hour when exposed to an ambient atmosphere .",
    "this decomposition would be induced by the reaction of an unusual valence state of bi ions in the material with water vapor in the atmosphere .",
    "thus , we paid attention so as to avoid decomposition or degradation of the sample . the sample of about 14.3  g was used in neutron diffraction measurements .",
    "electric resistivity and superconducting shielding measurements confirm that @xmath6 value and a volume fraction of shielding signal are the same as the values reported in ref .",
    "the powder neutron diffraction pattern for the analysis on a crystal structure was collected by using the high - resolution powder diffractometer ( hrpd ) installed in the reactor jrr-3 of japan atomic energy agency ( jaea ) .",
    "the neutron wavelength was 1.8234 @xmath18 and the collimation was open ( effective value of 35)-40-s-6 ( s denotes sample ) .",
    "the pattern was collected at room temperature .",
    "the powder sample was set in a vanadium holder enclosed in al cans filled with he gas in order to avoid the decomposition in the atmosphere .",

    "the intensities of 102 and 111 reflections are slightly enhanced at 2.9 k. these results show the existence of magnetic ordering at lower temperatures and the coexistence of magnetic ordering and the superconductivity . figure 2(b ) shows the intensity obtained by subtracting the intensity at 11.2  k from the intensity at 2.9  k. clear magnetic bragg peaks are observed at lower temperatures at the reciprocal lattice points corresponding to 100 , 102 , 111 , and 201 .",
    "the data are scattered around 2@xmath20 53  and 63  , due to large nuclear bragg intensities of 112/103 and 113/200 reflections whose intensities are about 70000 and 50000 counts at their peak positions , respectively .",
    "magnetic 113 reflection does not have clear peak profile due to the large experimental error mentioned above , although it should have almost the same intensity as the magnetic 201 reflection in the magnetic structure presented below .    from these results",
    ", we can consider the magnetic structure at low temperatures . for 10@xmath27 reflections ,",
    "the clear magentic bragg peaks are observed at @xmath28 and they are nearly absent at @xmath29 , indicating that the magnetic moments of two ce atoms in a unit cell at ( 1/4 1/4 0.2691 ) and ( 3/4 3/4 0.7309 ) are antiparallel .",
    "this intesity modulation of magnetic 10@xmath27 reflections against @xmath27 also shows that ni moments are almost independent of the observed magnetic bragg peaks even if the ni atoms have magnetic moments .",
    "the scattering intensity from the ni moments should not depend on @xmath27 because two ni atoms are located on a flat layer at @xmath30=1/2 . in magnetic susceptibility measurements ,",
    "the contribution of ni atom to the curie - weiss - like susceptibility is nearly absent.@xcite these results suggest that ni atom is nonmagnetic . the clear peaks are not observed at 00@xmath27 positions in fig .",

    "the absence of magnetic 00@xmath27 reflections indicates that the two ce moments are oriented along @xmath4 axis .",
    "it is consistent with the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility , indicating that the antiferromagnetic easy - axis is the @xmath4 axis.@xcite then we can get the magnetic structure shown in fig .",

    "the intensity of 102 reflection has a large error bar in this scale because this reflection includes the nuclear scattering .",
    "the intensities of both reflections increase with decreasing @xmath26 below about 5  k , consistent with the temperature at which the jump of the specific heat is observed.@xcite as shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "4(a ) , the temperature development of the magnetic bragg intensity is monotonous down to 2.9  k and an anomaly is not observed at the superconducting transtion temperature , 4.2  k. it is quite different from the behaviors observed in heavy fermion superconductors in which the magnetic ordering and the superconductivity coexist . for example ,",
    "cd - doped cecoin@xmath7 , ceco(in@xmath9cd@xmath10)@xmath7 with @xmath36=0.1 and 0.075 , exhibit the antiferromagnetic orderings of the ce moment at neel temperatures , @xmath37 3.0  k and 2.5  k , respectively .",

    "however , the developments of the magnetic bragg intensities are suppressed and they become almost flat to the temperature below @xmath6.@xcite the present @xmath26 dependence of the magnetic bragg intensity suggests that the ce 4@xmath8 electron is almost independent of the superconductivity and this compound is not a heavy fermion superconductor .    the solid line in fig .",
    "4(a ) shows the fitting of data below 5.0  k to the function that the intensity is proportional to @xmath38 and the extrapolation of the fitting function to 0 k. the amplitude of the momtent at 0 k obtained by the fitting is 1.71 @xmath34 . in the experimental accuracy ,",
    "any structural change is not observed and the tetragonal symmery remains down to 2.9  k. in the tetragonal symmetry , energy levels of the ce 4@xmath39 state split into three doublets , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , by the crytalline electric field , where the two former doublets consist of linear combination of @xmath43 and @xmath44 states , and the latter consists of @xmath45 state .",

    "the amplitude of the antiferromagnetic ordered moment is in good agreement with @xmath46 0.43  @xmath34.@xcite on the other hand , the ordered moment in this compound is much larger than the moment of ceagsb@xmath1 , indicating that the ground state of this compound is not the @xmath42 state .",
    "such differences of the amplitude of the ordered moment and/or the ground state are caused by the differences of the structural parameters and constituent elements .",

    "their saturated ordered moments which are estimated by magnetization curves are 1.76 and 2.1 @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "these behaviors are similar to the present compound while in cecubi@xmath1 and ceagbi@xmath1 , the superconductivity is not observed and their magnetization curves show metamagnetic behavior which is not observed in the present compound .",
    "ceni@xmath0bi@xmath1 has the same crystal structure as the so - called 1111 system which has a maximum @xmath6 of about 55  k among iron - based high-@xmath6 superconductors .",
    "theoretical studies on an iron - based high-@xmath6 superconductor point out that magnetic fluctuation arising from a nesting between fermi surfaces at @xmath47 and m points in an unfolded brillioun zone is an origin of the superconductivity@xcite .",
    "experimentally , strong corelations between the high-@xmath6 superconductivity and the spin fluctuation are observed in an iron - based high-@xmath6 superconductor . the inelastic neutron scattering measurements on lafeaso@xmath9f@xmath10 with @xmath36=0.057 , 0.082 and 0.157 , show that the spin fluctuation observed in the samples with @xmath36=0.057 and 0.082 , whose @xmath6 are about 30  k , almost disappears in the sample with @xmath36=0.157 in which the high-@xmath6 superconductivity is almost suppressed.@xcite on the other hand , the superconductivity may appear without magnetic fluctuation in ceni@xmath0bi@xmath1 , because ni is nonmagnetic and the ce moment is almost decoupled with the superconducting carrier .",
    "theaabsence of the magnetic fluctuation may indicate that the @xmath6 of ceni@xmath0bi@xmath1 is much lower than the values of iron - based superconductors although they have same crystal structures .",
    "we have performed neutron powder diffraction measurements on a new superconductor , ceni@xmath0bi@xmath1 , with @xmath2 4.2  k. the structural parameters at room temperature are determined by the rietveld method .",
    "the clear magnetic bragg peaks are observed at @xmath3=(0 0 0 ) below about 5  k. in the magnetic ordering phase , the two ce moments in the unit cell are antiparallel along the @xmath4 axis and the ni atom does not contribute to the magnetic bragg reflections . below @xmath6 , the superconductivity and antiferromagnetic ordering coexist .",
    "the magnetic bragg intensity monotonously increases with decreasing @xmath26 below about 5  k and does not exbihit an apparent anomaly at @xmath2 4.2  k , suggesting that the 4@xmath8 electron of the ce atom is almost independent of the superconductivity .",
