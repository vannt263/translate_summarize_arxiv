    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are transient events able to outshine the @xmath0-ray sky for a few seconds to a few minutes .",
    "the discovery of their optical @xcite and x - ray @xcite long - lasting counterparts represented a breakthrough for grb science .",
    "unfortunately , due to technological limitations , the x - ray observations were able to track the afterglow evolution starting hours after the trigger : only after the launch of the _ swift _ satellite in 2004 @xcite was this gap between the end of the prompt emission and several hours after the onset of the explosion filled with x - ray observations . a canonical picture",
    "was then established ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , with four different stages describing the overall structure of the x - ray afterglows : an initial steep decay , a shallow - decay phase , a normal decay and a jet - like decay stage .",
    "erratic flares are found to be superimposed mainly to the first and second stage of emission .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the four light - curve phases instead belong to only two different components of emission ( see e.g. , @xcite ) : the first , connected to the activity of the central engine giving rise to the prompt emission , comprises the flares ( @xcite and references therein ) and the steep - decay phase ; the second is instead related to the interaction of the outflow with the external medium and manifests itself in the x - ray regime through the shallow , normal and jet - like decay .",
    "observations able to further characterise the two components are therefore of particular interest .",
    "the smooth connection of the x - ray steep decay light - curve phase with the prompt @xmath0-ray emission strongly suggests a common physical origin ( @xcite ; @xcite ) : the high latitude emission ( hle ) model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) predicts that steep decay photons originate from the delay in the arrival time of prompt emission photons due to the longer path length from larger angles relative to our line of sight , giving rise to the @xmath2 relation ( where @xmath3 is the light - curve decay index and @xmath4 is the spectral energy index ) .",
    "no spectral evolution is expected in the simplest formulation of the hle effect in the case of a simple power - law prompt spectrum .",
    "observations say the opposite : significant variations of the photon index have been found in the majority of grbs during the steep decay phase ( see e.g. , @xcite ) ; more than this , the absorbed simple power - law ( spl ) has proved to be a poor description of the spectral energy distribution of the steep decay phase for grbs with the best statistics spectral coverage of the swift x - ray telescope , xrt @xcite , and the degeneracy between the variables of the spectral fit can in principle lead to the identification of an spl behaviour in intrinsically non - spl spectra with poor statistics . ] .",
    "a careful analysis of these events has shown their spectra to be best fit by an evolving band function @xcite , establishing the link between steep decay and prompt emission photons also from the spectral point of view ( see e.g. , grb060614 , @xcite ; grb070616 , @xcite ) : caused by the shift of the band spectrum , a temporal steep decay phase and a spectral softening appear simultaneously ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular , the peak energy of the @xmath5 spectrum is found to evolve to lower values , from the @xmath0-ray to the soft x - ray energy range . both the low ( as observed for grb070616 ) and the high - energy portion of the spectrum are likely to soften with time , but no observation is reported to confirm the high energy index behaviour during the prompt and steep decay phase .",
    "the observed spectral evolution with time is an invaluable footprint of the physical mechanisms at work : observations able to constrain the behaviour of the spectral parameters with time are therefore of primary importance .",
    "by contrast , no spectral evolution is observed in the x - ray during the shallow decay phase ( see e.g. @xcite ) experienced by most grbs between @xmath6 s and @xmath7 s. an unexpected discovery of the _ swift _ mission , the shallow decay is the first light - curve phase linked to the second emission component . a variety of theoretical explanations have been put forward .",
    "the proposed models include : energy injection ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; reverse shock ( see e.g. , @xcite ) ; time dependent micro - physical parameters ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) ; off - axis emission @xcite ; dust scattering @xcite .",
    "the predictions of all these models can only be compared to observations tracking the flat and decay phase of the second emission component , since its rise is usually missed in the x - ray regime , being hidden by the tail of the prompt emission .",
    "grb081028 is the first and unique event for which _ swift _ was able to capture the rise of the second emission component : the time properties of its rising phase can be constrained for the first time while contemporaneous optical observations allow us to track the evolution of a break energy of the spectrum through the optical band .",
    "grb081028 is also one of the lucky cases showing a spectrally evolving prompt emission where the evolution of the spectral parameters can be studied from @xmath0-rays to x - rays , from the trigger time to @xmath8 s. a hard to soft spectral evolution is clearly taking place beginning with the prompt emission and extending to the steep decay phase , as already found for other _ swift _ grbs ( grb060614 , @xcite ; grb070616 , @xcite , are showcases in this respect ) .",
    "notably , for grb081028 a softening of the slope of a band function @xcite above @xmath9 is also observed .",
