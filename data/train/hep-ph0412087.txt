    "the randall - sundrum(rs ) model@xcite provides a geometric solution to the hierarchy problem through an exponential warp factor whose magnitude is controlled by the separation , @xmath1 , of two 3-branes embedded in 5-d anti - desitter space , @xmath2 .",
    "it has been shown that this interbrane distance can be naturally stabilized at a value necessary to produced the experimentally observed ratio of the weak and planck scales@xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "sm matter in the rs model is confined to one of the 3-branes while gravity is allowed to propagate in the bulk .",
    "a very generic signature of this kind of scenario is the existence of tev - scale kaluza - klein(kk ) excitations of the graviton with inverse tev - scale couplings to the sm fields .",
    "these states will appear as a series of spin-2 resonances in a number of processes that should be observable at both hadron and @xmath3 colliders which probe the tev - scale .",
    "the masses and couplings of these kk graviton states will be determined with reasonably high precision by future collider measurements .",
    "another possible rs signature is the copious production of tev scale black holes , though this is not a unique feature of the rs model@xcite .",
    "one can easily imagine that this simple rs scenario is incomplete from either a top - down or bottom - up perspective .",
    "we would generally expect some ` soft ' modifications to the details of the picture presented above , hopefully without disturbing the nice qualitative features of the model .",
    "one such extension of the basic rs model is the existence of higher curvature terms which might be expected on general grounds from string theory@xcite or other possible high - scale completions .",
    "once we open the door to such possibilities the number of potential new terms in the action can grow rather rapidly as the number of scalars that we can form from products of the curvature and ricci tensors as well as the ricci scalar are enormous .",
    "a certain general class of such invariants with very interesting properties was first generally described by lovelock@xcite and , hence , are termed lovelock invariants .",
    "( they are also sometimes referred to , apart from a factor of @xmath4 , as euler densities since their volume integrals are related to the euler characteristics . )",
    "the lovelock invariants come in fixed order , @xmath5 , which we denote as @xmath6 , that describes the number of powers of the curvature tensor , contracted in various ways , out of which they are constructed . given a space of dimension",
    "@xmath7 the order of these invariants is constrained : for @xmath8 , the lovelock invariant is a topological one and leads to a total derivative in the action whereas all higher order invariants , @xmath9 , can be shown to vanish identically by various curvature tensor index symmetry properties . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the @xmath6 are dynamical objects that once introduced into the action for gravity can be shown to lead only to second order equations of motion as is the case for ordinary einstein gravity , , no terms with derivatives higher than second will appear in the equations of motion due to their presence .",
    "generally , arbitrary invariants formed from ever higher powers of the curvature tensor will lead to equations of motion of ever higher order , , ever more co - ordinate derivatives of the metric tensor and graviton field , , terms with quartic derivatives . such theories will lead to very serious problems with both the presence of ghosts as well as with unitarity@xcite .",
    "the lovelock invariants are constructed in such a way as to be free of these problems making them very special and are found to be just the forms taken by the higher order curvature terms generated in perturbative string theory@xcite .",
    "this is just what we may have expected if string theories are to avoid these unitarity issues . indeed ,",
    "if one tracks potential ghost generating contributions through the fog of higher derivative terms in the lovelock invariants one sees that they vanish identically .    in the case of 4-d , apart from numerical factors , @xmath11 while @xmath12 , the ordinary ricci scalar .",
    "the invariant of the next order , @xmath13 , can be identified with the gauss - bonnet(g - b ) invariant , @xmath14 , which is a topological term as well as a total derivative and can be written _ in 4-d _ as @xmath15 .",
    "all higher order invariants vanish .",
    "when we go to 5-d , as is the case we will discuss below , all the @xmath16 still vanish as in 4-d but the g - b invariant is no longer a total derivative and its presence will modify the results obtained from einstein gravity in the rs model , altering the equations of motion .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we demand the absence of ghosts , , terms with no more than two derivatives of the metric , then the addition of the g - b piece to the einstein term is the _",
    "unique _ modification of the 5-d rs bulk action .",
    "what is particularly amazing is that the addition of the g - b term to the conventional rs model still allows for a solution with the same qualitative structure as is present in the traditional rs model@xcite .",
    "in fact , generalizing to @xmath7 dimensions , meissner and olechowski@xcite have shown that rs - like solutions exist with the presence of @xmath17-branes even allowing for all of the non - zero @xmath6 contributions to be present in the bulk action .",
    "some of the modifications of the rs model due the presence of g - b terms have been discussed by other authors ( , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we are interested in how the presence of the g - b term alters the detailed collider phenomenology of the rs model .",
    "these modifications may occur in many different ways and places .",
    "one can imagine , , that since the g - b term is of higher order , the triple graviton coupling in the rs model@xcite may be sensitive to its existence .",
    "while this is certainly true , it turns out that this is not the most immediate or sensitive way to probe for the existence of g - b contributions to the action . as we will see below , the existence of g - b terms will lead to significant changes in the masses and sm matter couplings of the kaluza - klein gravitons themselves .",
    "this variation is described by a single new parameter that has a rather restricted range in order to avoid tachyons being introduced into the model .",
    "in addition , we will demonstrate that the anticipated production rate for black holes at colliders can be significantly increased by the existence of g - b terms in comparison to the usual rs scenario . for simplicity , we will ignore issues having to do with the radion@xcite in what follows as this physics may be sensitive to the stabilization mechanism@xcite",
    ". the reader must be careful , however , to insure that no tachyons arise in this sector of the theory when exploring the model parameter space .",
    "we will also restrict our analysis to the case where the sm fields are confined to the tev - brane .",
    "generalization to the case of bulk sm fields is straightforward@xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we will present the basic kaluza - klein formalism and then determine the masses , couplings and wavefunctions for the graviton excitations in the rs model in the presence of g - b terms . in section 3 we will discuss how observations of graviton resonances and measurements of their properties at colliders can be used to determine the value of the new parameter describing the g - b interactions or place stringent upper bound on its value if no deviations from the conventional rs scenario are observed .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion of black hole production at the lhc and how it will be substantially enhanced by any appreciable g - b terms .",
    "we will also show how the modifications to the usual rs picture can lead to a significant alteration in the shape and parameter dependence of the black hole subprocess cross section . we then summarize and conclude .",
    "the appendix outlines the changes to our basic formalism which are necessary if graviton brane kinetic terms arising from the usual einstein action are also present .",
    "the essential ansatz of the 5-d rs scenario is the existence of a slice of warped , anti - desitter space bounded by two ` branes ' which we assume are fixed at the @xmath18 orbifold fixed points , @xmath19 , termed the planck and tev branes , respectively@xcite .",
    "we take the 5-d metric describing this setup to be given by the conventional expression @xmath20 as usual , due to the @xmath18 orbifold symmetry we require @xmath21 and , in keeping with the rs solution , we expect @xmath22 with @xmath23 a dimensionful constant of order the fundamental planck scale .",
    "as first shown in ref.@xcite the inclusion of g - b terms does not alter this basic setup .",
    "the action for the model we consider takes the form @xmath24 where @xmath25\\,,\\ ] ] describes the bulk with @xmath26 being the 5-d fundamental planck scale , @xmath27 the bulk cosmological constant and @xmath28 is a dimensionless constant of unknown sign which we expect to be of order unity based on naturalness arguments . here",
    "we note that the upper case roman indices @xmath29 run over @xmath30 while greek indices will continue to run over @xmath31 .",
    "this bulk action contains not only the usual ricci scalar , @xmath32 , of einstein gravity but also the gauss - bonnet quadratic curvature term .",
    "similarly @xmath33 describes the two branes with @xmath34 being the determinant of the induced metric and @xmath35 the associated brane tensions ; the @xmath36 describe possible sm fields on the branes . in what follows",
    "we will assume as usual that the sm fields are all localized on the tev brane at @xmath37 .",
    "for simplicity we have not considered potential contributions arising from brane kinetic terms for the graviton generated by the ricci scalars evaluated on the two branes@xcite ; as we will see in the appendix , such contributions can be included in a relatively straightforward manner .",
    "g - b like brane terms are automatically absent as the g - b invariant is at most a surface term in less than 5-d .    to go further we insert our metric ansatz into the equations of motion arising from the above action ; we obtain @xmath38 as usual together with@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the combination @xmath42 as in the conventional rs model",
    "the solution indeed takes the form @xmath22 though greater than normal care is required to regularize the associated @xmath43-functions . since @xmath44 using the set of useful relations@xcite @xmath45 one then finds @xmath46 this differs by a factor of @xmath47 in the @xmath28-dependent term from the work of kim , kyae and lee@xcite due to an error in their application of the proper boundary conditions .",
    "in addition , using the relation @xmath48 , we obtain the following explicit expression for @xmath23 : @xmath49^{1/2 } \\,.\\ ] ] note that for @xmath50 , @xmath27 may in principle take either sign whereas it must be negative if @xmath51 ; the conventional rs limit can be obtained by employing the negative root in the equation above with @xmath27 negative and taking the limit @xmath52 .    in order to obtain the equations of motion for the kk excitations we need to go beyond this vacuum solution",
    "; to this end we consider metric perturbations of the form @xmath53 and employ the traceless - transverse gauge with @xmath54 as usual followed by the kk decomposition @xmath55 such that the klein - gordon equation , @xmath56 , yields the kk masses .",
    "the @xmath57 wavefunctions are then seen to satisfy@xcite @xmath58\\chi_n= m_n^2e^{2\\sigma}(1 - 4\\bar \\alpha   \\sigma'^2 + 4\\bar \\alpha \\sigma'')\\chi_n\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 , as obtained by @xcite .",
    "letting @xmath60 , the left - hand side of the expression above can be simplified using the identities in eq.(8 ) to produce @xmath61 which after some algebra directly leads to the g - b generalization@xcite of eq.(5 ) in @xcite obtained long ago : @xmath62 +    m_n^2e^{-2\\sigma}\\bigg(1 - 4{\\alpha\\over { m^2}}\\sigma'^2 + 4{\\alpha \\over{m^2 } } \\sigma''\\bigg)\\psi_n=0\\,.\\ ] ] as noted by other authors@xcite , it is straightforward to see that this produces the same differential equation in the bulk for the kk eigenfunctions as found in the usual rs scenario@xcite and thus @xmath63 with @xmath64 being a combination of bessel functions of order @xmath65 and where @xmath66 is a normalization factor . following our earlier work@xcite we choose to normalize the kk states over the full interval @xmath67 . for a differential equation with this truncated sturm - liouville form@xcite @xmath68'+\\lambda_n w(y)\\psi_n=0\\,,\\ ] ]",
    "the eigenfunctions are to be orthonormalized with respect to the weight function @xmath69 which we can read off in our case from eq.(15 ) above : @xmath70 so that @xmath71 thus , making use of the orbifold symmetry , we obtain the normalization factor @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "neglecting terms suppressed by powers of @xmath74 , for the massless zero - mode graviton this yields the explicit expression @xmath75 where we have defined for later purposes the combination @xmath76 knowing this normalization we can directly relate the 5-d parameters @xmath26 and @xmath23 to the ( effective ) 4-d planck mass , @xmath77 : @xmath78 to obtain the explicit expression for the normalization of the massive kk excitations we need to examine the two boundary conditions which are now quite different than in the usual rs model .",
    "these are obtained by the integration of eq.(15 ) above around the two branes at @xmath79 and @xmath1 ; from this procedure we arrive at @xmath80 and @xmath81 where the eigenfunctions and their derivatives are evaluated on the positive side of both branes .",
    "these boundary conditions then determine both the wavefunction coefficients @xmath82 as well as the kk masses @xmath83 ; we obtain @xmath84 whose roots determine the @xmath85 and @xmath86 note that under _ most _ circumstances @xmath87 and can be safely ignored as in the usual rs case ; some care , however , needs to be exercised as @xmath88 . from these expressions",
    "we can straightforwardly obtain an explicit expression for the normalization factor for the kk excitation wavefunctions : @xmath89 where subleading terms in powers of @xmath74 have been neglected .",
    "the usual rs model is seen to correspond to the limit @xmath90 in the expressions above .    at this point",
    "the experienced reader may notice that the modifications to the rs expressions above due to the new g - b interactions is strikingly similar in nature to those produced by the addition of conventional @xmath32-type kinetic terms on both branes@xcite .",
    "this will allow one to combine the contributions of both these new physics sources into rather simple expressions as we will see in the appendix below .",
    "the discussion above tells us that the modifications of the basic rs model due to g - b terms can be described by a single parameter , @xmath91 . to go further and see this in detail we must understand the potential range of this parameter .",
    "since we expect @xmath28 to be of order unity as well as @xmath92 , one should expect that @xmath91 is also of order unity .",
    "the arguments given in ref.@xcite suggest that @xmath91 can not be positive as this leads to a tachyon in the kk spectrum . to verify this claim",
    "we have examined eq.(26 ) in detail when @xmath93 for imaginary roots of the form @xmath94 with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . here",
    "we see that indeed a pair of tachyonic roots do exist for @xmath95 which move off to infinity as we approach the rs limit @xmath96 .",
    "we thus agree that solutions with positive values of @xmath91 are indeed excluded .",
    "a similar search for tachyonic roots for @xmath97 was unsuccessful so we conclude that @xmath98 to which we now restrict ourselves ; this implies that the parameter @xmath28 is also @xmath99 .",
    "eq.(21 ) provides the normalization for the zero - mode graviton wavefunction which must be positive definite in order to avoid ghosts .",
    "we notice that this requires @xmath100 which then implies , via the definition eq.(22 ) and the negative @xmath91 constraint , that @xmath91 is confined to the range @xmath101 a short analysis shows that the consideration of the the normalization factor for the graviton kk excitations will not improve upon this bound . thus @xmath91 is constrained to be in a rather narrow range which significantly increases the predictability of the model . given the definition of @xmath91 , eq.(29 ) implies that @xmath102    to begin a phenomenological analysis the first question to address is : how does the kk graviton spectrum shift as we turn on a non - zero @xmath91 ? to this end we extract the first few roots , @xmath85 , provided by eq.(26 ) and follow their @xmath91-dependence ; this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . here",
    "we see that the overall @xmath91 dependence of the roots is rather weak across the rather restricted allowed range for @xmath91 .",
    "the values of the roots are seen to decrease slightly as @xmath91 moves away from 0 .",

    "kinetic terms , but _",
    "unlike _ in the usual rs model , the couplings of the kk graviton tower states have become level - dependent . in particular , the kk states will always become more weakly coupled as we go up the kk tower .",
    "furthermore , we see that the couplings of all the kk states _ vanish _ as @xmath105 .",
    "( it is interesting to note that a very similar rescaling of the conventional rs result holds for the case when sm fields are put in bulk . )",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the rapid decrease in the couplings of the first five kk states as @xmath91 decreases from 0 .",
    "the couplings are observed to vanish more quickly as one goes farther up the kk tower as expected .     as functions of the parameter @xmath91 .",
    "note that in the rs limit all states have the same coupling.,width=321 ]    in addition to specifying @xmath91 and the mass of the first kk excitation , @xmath106 , to completely determine the phenomenology of this model we need to know the ratio @xmath107 which enters into the expression for the kk widths . in the usual rs model",
    "this ratio is bounded by the requirement that we do nt want potential quantum ( , higher curvature ) corrections to dominate over those from classical einstein gravity .",
    "this requirement is traditionally stated as @xmath108 , which implies that @xmath109 for a 5-d anti - desitter space ; combining with eq.(23 ) in the @xmath52 limit then implies @xmath110 which is the usual result . under the present circumstances",
    "there may be ( at least ) three objections to this argument .",
    "first , since we are already including g - b terms there is no longer any reason to demand small curvature and thus @xmath111 may be larger than @xmath112 .",
    "a second objection is that if we do truly want small higher - curvature terms for some reason the traditional constraint on @xmath111 may be too weak . to see this we note that for the rs vacuum solution we know that @xmath113 ( hence , the limit above ) , @xmath114 and @xmath115 which implies that the g - b invariant has the value @xmath116 .",
    "these large numerical coefficients may imply that a stronger constraint on @xmath111 might be necessary .",
    "a third observation is that even if @xmath117 holds , for finite @xmath28 from eqs.(21 ) and ( 23 ) we find that @xmath118 so that , given the bound on negative @xmath91 above , the ratio @xmath119 can become _ arbitrarily _ large as @xmath91 approaches @xmath120 .",
    "while we will restrict ourselves to the conventional rs range of @xmath119 in what follows for purposes of comparison , we remind the reader that much larger values of this ratio may now be possible .",
    "( there are , however , other reasons to believe that this ratio may remain as constrained as in the conventional rs model as discussed in ref.@xcite ) . given a values of @xmath91 and the ratio @xmath107",
    ", we note that the parameter @xmath28 can now be uniquely determined : @xmath121     assuming @xmath122 gev and @xmath123(top ) or 0.1(bottom ) . the usual rs model prediction with @xmath124 is shown in green while the corresponding results in the present model with @xmath125(red ) and @xmath126(blue ) are also displayed.,width=321 ]     assuming @xmath122 gev and @xmath123(top ) or 0.1(bottom ) . the usual rs model prediction with @xmath124 is shown in green while the corresponding results in the present model with @xmath125(red ) and @xmath126(blue ) are also displayed.,width=321 ]    with these preliminaries we can now examine how these kk graviton states would appear at a collider in comparison to the expectations of the rs model . to this end",
    "we examine the process @xmath127 in the energy range accessible to the international linear collider(ilc ) and its potential upgrades .",
    "a similar analysis can , of course , be performed at the lhc . to be specific for purposes of demonstration",
    "we take @xmath122 gev and @xmath128 ; the results of these calculations are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where we show the cases @xmath129 in comparison to the standard rs model predictions with @xmath124 .",
    "several things are immediately apparent : first , as the magnitude of @xmath91 increases , the kk states become increasingly narrow and their mass splitting is also seen to increase significantly .",
    "second , with @xmath106 held fixed , the observation of a single graviton resonance and a determination of its properties would be insufficient to tell us whether or not g - b terms are present in the action .",
    "the reason for this is clear : if we just observe a single state we can attribute its width solely to the value of @xmath130 .",
    "we see for example that the width of the first kk is decreased as @xmath91 decreases from zero by the square of the factor appearing in fig  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the only thing we can extract from the first kk width is the value of an _ effective _ @xmath130 which tells us nothing about the true value of @xmath130 or @xmath91 . to obtain the values of these quantities we need to also find the second kk excitation .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that the mass of the second kk increases relative to the first as the magnitude of @xmath91 increases ; it also gets much more narrow .",
    "these observations provide our best handles on @xmath91 .",
    "if we measure the ratio of the first two kk masses , @xmath131 , this will directly tell us the value of @xmath91 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .     described in the text as functions of @xmath91.,width=321 ]     described in the text as functions of @xmath91.,width=321 ]",
    "we can get a second handle on @xmath91 as well as @xmath130 ( and thus @xmath119 through the relation @xmath132 ) by comparing the decay widths of the first two kk states after removing ` phase space ' factors and knowing their respective masses . since kinematically @xmath133 , the scaled ratio @xmath134 would be unity in the usual rs model if we neglect the masses of the final state particles .",
    "this ratio depends rather strongly on the value of @xmath91 when g - b terms are present as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . recall that as @xmath91 approaches @xmath120 the couplings of the kk states to sm matter on the tev brane vanishes so that they will no longer be produced at colliders .",
    "of course , the _ ratio _ of the couplings of two different kk states remains finite .    for fixed @xmath91 and @xmath119",
    "it is interesting to examine the widths of the graviton kk resonances as we go farther up the tower . in the usual rs scenario",
    "the widths grow quite rapidly @xmath135 and eventually the resonance structure is lost as can be seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "once g - b terms are present , however , the coupling decreases as @xmath136 increases and eventually @xmath137 .",
    "this means that for appreciable values of @xmath91 the kk states are all becoming rather narrow as we go further and further up the tower .",
    "this can be seen more explicitly by examining the ratio @xmath138 as a function of @xmath91 for the different kk tower states as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5p ] . here",
    "we see that for large @xmath91 the kk states remain narrow and have almost the same value of @xmath139 independent of @xmath5 .     as a function of @xmath91 for the first ten kk states .",
    "the kk number goes up as we go from the bottom to the top of the figure .",
    "@xmath123 has been chosen for purposes of demonstration.,width=321 ]    one may wonder just how small a value of @xmath91 might be measurable .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] that the ilc will be highly sensitive to small values of @xmath91 through the mass and width ratios discussed above . note in particular that in the region near @xmath124 the @xmath91 dependence of @xmath140 is significantly greater than that for @xmath141 . to get a feeling for the level of sensitivity we note that a determination of @xmath142 at the level of @xmath143 , which seems rather straightforward at the ilc , will be sensitive to values of @xmath91 of order @xmath144 to @xmath145 or less .",
    "thus even small deviations from the standard rs scenario should be observable at the ilc .",
    "of course , a detailed analysis accounting for accelerator and detector effects should be performed to confirm these conclusions .",
    "the possibility that tev scale black holes(bh ) may be a copious signal for extra dimensions at future colliders has been discussed by a number of authors@xcite for both the flat and warped background cases . a leading approximation for the subprocess cross - section for the production of a bh of mass @xmath146 is just the geometric bh size@xcite @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the @xmath149-dimensional schwarzschild radius corresponding to the mass @xmath146 .",

    "then the quantity @xmath170 can be expressed as @xmath171 so that , with @xmath172 and @xmath173 for purposes of demonstration , we arrive at @xmath174 which is significant only for very large @xmath169 .",

    "( bottom ) same as in the top panel but now for a fixed minimum black hole mass of 6 tev as a function of @xmath91.,width=321 ]    although we have seen a substantial increase in the bh cross section relative to the rs model due to g - b terms , the overall normalization of the cross section remains uncertain due to the complexities of bh formation by terms of order unity as has been discussed by many authors@xcite . while overall factors may be uncertain we might expect the various scaling laws to remain at least approximately valid . in the case of flat extra dimensions , or in the rs model in the @xmath151 limit , the value of @xmath177 uniquely determines the simple dependence of the cross section on the ratio @xmath178 : @xmath179^{2/(n+1)}$ ] . here , for the case of a single warped extra dimension , the g - b terms conspire to modify the shape of the cross section as a function of @xmath178 in a rather unique manner .",
    "this can even be seen by examining the approximate expression eq.(37 ) : the subprocess cross section is generally no longer proportional to a single power of @xmath178 .",
    "in fact , as the g - b terms come to dominate , the subprocess cross section becomes essentially independent of @xmath146 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] where the important feature to notice is the shape of the distribution and not the overall magnitude .",
    "note that this effect happens quite rapidly as a non - zero value of @xmath91 is turned on .",
    "this rather distinctive behavior may be observable in bh production at the lhc once the parton distribution luminosity is unfolded and will help to pin down the existence of g - b interactions .",
    "it should then be possible to correlate shifts in the production properties of bh with those of graviton resonances to precisely determine the g - b parameter @xmath91 .     for different values of @xmath91 . from bottom",
    "to top the curves correspond to @xmath180 and @xmath126 , respectively.,width=321 ]",
    "higher - dimensional curvature corrections to einstein gravity are to be expected on rather general grounds ; the observation of any effect arising from such terms will tell us important information about the ultraviolet completion of this theory . the requirements of unitarity and the absence of ghosts in the 5-d randall - sundrum model uniquely determine the form such terms may take and eliminates any derivatives higher than second in the equations of motion .",
    "consequentially , the gauss - bonnet invariant is singled out as the only possible new non - trivial addition to the bulk action for gravity beyond the usual ricci scalar .",
    "the existence of g - b terms in the action has been previously shown to leave the qualitative features of the rs model invariant but the quantitative details are expected to be altered , perhaps significantly .    in this paper",
    "we have begun to examine the phenomenological implications of the existence of additional g - b terms in the rs bulk action .",
    "two of the dominant signatures for the rs model are the production of tev - scale graviton resonances and the production of black holes at future colliders .",
    "this paper has shown that both of these processes can be significantly altered if g - b terms are present in any appreciable amount .",
    "if no deviations from the classic rs model predictions are observed , we have shown that stringent bounds can be placed on the parameter @xmath91 which describes the relative strength of the g - b terms .",
    "the first step in this analysis was to determine how the graviton kk masses , couplings and wavefunctions are modified by the presence of the g - b terms .",
    "once this was done we analyzed the production properties of the kk graviton resonances at the ilc ; we showed the mass spectrum and decay widths of these resonances were substantially different than in the rs case over most of the g - b model parameter space .",
    "it was demonstrated that the kk mass and width ratio measurements at the ilc can be highly sensitive to the presence of g - b terms and can be used to precisely determine their strength or to place strong bounds on their existence if no deviations from the rs model are observed .",
    "next we examined the production of bh at the lhc in the rs model with g - b terms .",
    "we found that not only is the production cross section significantly enhanced in comparison to the conventional rs model but its parametric dependence on the ratio @xmath178 can be drastically altered even for small values of @xmath91 .",
    "any deviations observed in the production of graviton resonances at the lhc or ilc can then be directly correlated with modifications to bh production to determine the value of @xmath91 .",
    "hopefully signals of warped extra dimensions will be observed at future colliders and we may be ultimately be able to probe the ultraviolet completion of quantum gravity .    *",

    "in this appendix we consider a modification of the action given by eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) above to include graviton brane kinetic terms generated by the 4-d ricci curvature scalars on the tev and planck branes .",
    "such terms have been suggested in the case of g - b extensions of the rs model@xcite to help assist removal of the tachyon field present@xcite when @xmath50 . using the notation above as well as in ref.@xcite ,",

    ", we find that the only change induced by these new brane terms is to modify the definition of @xmath69 given in eq.(18 ) above to @xmath185 with the subsequent appropriate changes in the boundary conditions : @xmath186 and @xmath187 where now we now define the combinations @xmath188 the generalizations of the other equations in the main text can now be read off directly , , @xmath189 and @xmath190 determine the masses and wavefunctions of the kk states .",
    "a short analysis shows that there will exist parameter ranges that are tachyon free .",
    "the collider and black hole analyses will now require a detailed exploration of this @xmath191 parameter space which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
