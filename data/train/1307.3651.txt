    "application of a dc current @xmath5 to a superconductor can result in extreme spatial variations in the local temperature @xmath3 known as hot spots@xcite .",
    "a hot spot was first inferred from the observed hysteresis in the current - voltage @xmath5-@xmath10 characteristics ( ivcs ) of low transition temperature @xmath0 superconducting microbridges@xcite . subsequently thin film hot - spot @xmath3 s",
    "were observed using low-@xmath11 scanning electron microscopy ( ltsem)@xcite . in devices of the high-@xmath0 superconductor yba@xmath1cu@xmath12o@xmath13 ( ybco ) , equivalent hot spot detections were made using ltsem and low-@xmath11 scanning laser microscopy ( ltslm)@xcite . both ltsem and ltslm scanning measurements can distort the @xmath3 observations because they do not measure @xmath14 directly but measure overall voltage changes @xmath15 induced by the local heating of either the perturbing scanning electron or laser beams@xcite , and their interactions with @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , from their experimental principles , @xmath14 obtained by ltsem and ltslm can be exaggerated near the transition temperature @xmath0 because of the peaking response at @xmath16@xcite .",
    "moreover , they are also surface sensitive because of the different absorption coefficients depending on the different surface materials",
    ". especially , the ltslm images may include spurious reflections due to the excessive responses from the edges of the mesa.@xcite .",
    "kolodner and tyson invented another method to measure the local temperature with high spatial resolution@xcite .",
    "it involves covering the sample with a thin polymer film containing rare earth complexes , exciting the complexes with ultraviolet ( uv ) light , and measuring their resulting @xmath11-dependent photoluminescence ( pl ) . by applying this technique to thin films of ybco and the high-@xmath0 superconductor bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bi2212 ) , the photoluminescence of the covering polymer film provided detailed maps of the hot spot @xmath3 in the superconducting film without any scanning distortions , because this technique allows for a direct measurement of @xmath3@xcite .",
    "however , even such measurements can include @xmath14 distortions caused by multiple light reflections from parallel regions of the polymer film surface and variable fluorescence efficiencies arising from regions of non - uniform polymer film thickness , especially at the sample s corners and edges@xcite .",
    "these undesired distortions possibly present in the measured @xmath14 can be eliminated by a new pl technique in which the sample surface is uniformly covered with a large number of sic microcrystals@xcite .",
    "the irregular microcrystals have sizes of @xmath17 m , comparable to the sample thickness , so surface reflections are randomly oriented and edge distortions are negligible . after exposure to uv light , the sic microcrystals emit strongly @xmath11-dependent pl@xcite , which may be used to calibrate the @xmath14 measurements .",
    "sic forms in 3c , 4h , 6h , 15r , and less common polytypes , with energy gaps of @xmath18 2 ev@xcite .",
    "the challenges are to find the polytype mixture with a strongly and continuously @xmath11-dependent pl over the @xmath11 range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , to produce a uniform coverage of the superconductor with sic microcrystals , and to find the best circumstances for their use .    here",
    "we employ sic microcrystals to study the relationship between the simultaneous formation of hot spots and the coherent sub - thz emission from bi2212 mesas .",
    "the recent discovery of coherent sub - thz electromagnetic ( em ) wave emission from mesa structures of bi2212 has generated great interest@xcite .",
    "the goal is to fill the so - called `` thz gap''@xcite with the intrinsic josephson junctions ( ijjs ) stacked one - dimensionally along the @xmath21 axis of a single crystal@xcite .",
    "since there are @xmath22 identical ijjs in a single crystalline bi2212 mesa 1 @xmath23 m thick , the coherent output power , @xmath24 @xmath25 from a mesa can be enhanced from @xmath26pw for a single junction to tens of @xmath23w@xcite . however , bi2212 mesa structures with @xmath27 ijjs encounter serious heating problems due to the large @xmath5 injected into the mesa@xcite , causing the mesa to develop a hot spot @xmath3 that exceeds @xmath0 on its top surface , even though the bath temperature @xmath28 of its substrate is held to well below @xmath0@xcite .",
    "this hot - spot behavior and its effects upon the sub - thz emission from bi2212 were studied by ltslm@xcite . based upon their observations that the sub - thz emission can occur even with such a highly nonuniform @xmath3 variation containing a local hot spot with @xmath29 in the higher @xmath5 bias regime of the ivcs , they suggested that the hot - spot formation may be beneficial to the synchronization of the @xmath9 ijjs , an essential ingredient for obtaining intense sub - thz radiation .",
    "numerical simulations of a hot spot@xcite , the fact that the @xmath21-axis resistance @xmath30 can be shunted by the hot spot due to @xmath11 regions of negative differential resistivity , @xmath31@xcite , the much narrower line width of @xmath32mhz in the high-@xmath5 bias hot spot region than in the retrapping , low-@xmath5 bias regime@xcite , and the lack of radiation from mesas with thicker au electrodes@xcite , all tend to support their hypothesis that the hot spots play an essential role in the synchronization of the ijjs .    besides the hot - spot detection , the ltslm measurements also detected standing waves in rectangular and disc - shaped mesas@xcite . in describing the observations ,",
    "it was suggested that at high-@xmath5 bias , the mesa was effectively divided into a hot - spot region where @xmath29 and the superconducting remainder of the mesa@xcite .",
    "it was further suggested that sub - thz radiation arising in the remaining superconducting region at a frequency @xmath33 due to the ac josephson effect , where @xmath34 is the electronic charge and @xmath35 is planck s constant , could be enhanced by locking onto an effective em cavity mode frequency @xmath36@xcite , where @xmath37 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath38 is the index of refraction of bi2212 , and the standing wavelength @xmath39 is determined by the effective em cavity geometry generated by the boundaries of the single superconducting region of the mesa reduced in size by the @xmath40 boundaries of one or more hot spots@xcite .",
    "if this suggestion were correct , then changing the locus of the hot - spot boundaries could increase the tunability of the mesa s sub - thz emission @xmath41 .    in rectangular mesas , the standing waves observed either by ltslm or by rare - earth embedded polymer films formed along the mesa s length@xcite , although usually the observed @xmath42@xcite , by excitation of the tm(1,0 ) thin rectangular em cavity mode , where @xmath43 is the mesa width both in the high-@xmath5 bias reversible ( r - type ) region and in the low-@xmath5 bias retrapping irreversible ( ir - type ) regions , regardless of hot spot formation.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , angular distribution experiments in the planes normal to the length and width of the rectangular mesa could not distinguish the difference between those associated standing wave models@xcite .",
    "in one disk mesa , a standing wave - like pattern similar to that of the tm(3,1 ) thin cylindrical em cavity mode was detected by ltslm@xcite , which they claimed to be standing magnetic field waves@xcite , not standing electric field waves that could be generated by the observed @xmath15 changes@xcite .",
    "but it was not clear whether the observed emission was generated by the excitation of that mode , by the previously detected fundamental tm(1,1 ) mode@xcite , or by something else .",
    "a model calculation with an inhomogeneous critical current simulating a hot spot did not provide support to those observations@xcite . by application of a magnetic field",
    "@xmath44 t parallel to the layers , the standing waves disappeared , and were therefore interpreted as arising from the josephson effect@xcite .",
    "thus the questions of whether the standing waves detected by ltslm or ( by the pl measurement with rare - earth embedded polymer film@xcite ) were em cavity waves associated with the emission , and/or were only a spurious em wave effect generated by the laser itself ( and/or its surface reflections ) , and/or were also @xmath3 standing waves , or were yet something else , were unresolved .    here",
    "we present direct sic microcrystalline pl measurements of @xmath3 on the top of a rectangular bi2212 mesa during sub - thz emission , that settles the main question of whether the hot spot plays an important role in synchronizing the ijjs for the sub - thz emission , and the secondary question of whether the standing waves observed by ltslm or rare - earth embedded polymer films were em cavity waves associated with the emission , were just a spurious em wave effect , were @xmath3 standing waves@xcite , or were yet something else .",
    "microcrystalline sic pl experiments directly detect @xmath3 on the @xmath23 m length scale but do not detect em standing waves . in agreement with the ltslm and rare - earth embedded polymer thin film experiments@xcite",
    ", the sic pl measurements revealed that a rectangular mesa can have an extremely non - uniform @xmath3 distribution forming an elliptical hot spot with a central @xmath29 region , while the rest of the mesa is still superconducting .",
    "the size of the hot - spot region in the mesa grows or shrinks reversibly in the higher-@xmath5 bias regime of the ivcs , and sometimes the hot - spot position jumps dramatically from one central location @xmath45 to another within the mesa without significant ivc changes , and it suddenly vanishes and @xmath3 becomes almost uniform when @xmath5 is reduced to its lower bias regime .",
    "we further observed strong sub - thz radiation at rather high-@xmath28 @xmath46 50 k values in the retrapping regions of lower-@xmath5 bias , where hot spots do not exist , suggesting strongly that hot spots do not play a crucial role in the synchronization of @xmath9 ijjs for the sub - thz radiation .",
    "moreover , in striking contrast to the standing waves observed by ltslm and rare - earth embedded polymer films@xcite , @xmath3 standing waves were never observed in our sic pl experiments .",
    "the sub - thz radiation frequency @xmath41 was observed to be essentially unaffected by the size and position of the hot spot , as it always maintains the primary and secondary radiation conditions : the ac - josephson relation @xmath33 and the rectangular mesa em cavity tm(1,0 ) resonance condition @xmath42 , regardless of a hot spot s presence@xcite .",
    "considering all of the experimental results described above , whether this non - mutualistic relationship between the hot spot and the sub - thz emission extends to the remarkable synchronization of the emissions from the @xmath9 ijjs is still unknown@xcite , but our results strongly suggest that a mutualistic synchronization effect is unlikely.@xcite",
    "the sub - thz emitting mesa devices were fabricated by an ar - ion milling technique using metal masks from a piece of a mm - sized thin single crystal of bi2212@xcite .",
    "more details were given previously@xcite .",
    "of the several candidate @xmath3-sensitive coating materials we tested , the air - stable , commercial ( kojundo chemical laboratory co. ltd . , japan ) mixed - polytype sic powder 2 - 3 @xmath23",
    "m in size was chosen because it exhibited not only the strongest @xmath11 dependence of its pl intensity near the @xmath0 of bi2212 , but also the best non - magnetic , chemically resistant and electrically insulating properties .",
    "a water suspension of the sic microcrystals was painted on the top surface of the mesa , and the sample was turned upside down to dry . while drying , gravity and the water surface tension combined to spread the microcrystals uniformly on the hanging suspension surface . after drying ,",
    "the uniformity of the microcrystalline sic surface coverage was checked by direct observation of the pl intensity under a microscope by exposing uv light over the entire mesa at @xmath47 , as described in detail in section iic .",
    "figure 1(a ) was produced from a photograph of the device studied , which consists of five congruent rectangular mesas of length @xmath48 = 400 @xmath23 m and width @xmath43 = 80 @xmath23 m .",
    "one mesa was measured by atomic force microscopy to have a trapezoidal cross section with top and bottom widths of 79 and 89 @xmath23 m , respectively , and a height of @xmath49 = 2.40 @xmath23 m , including a 70 nm thick au top electrode .",
    "the small red square highlights the current injection position .",
    "figure 1(b ) is a stereographical sketch of the mesa device highlighted by the large red rectangle in fig .",
    "1(a ) .",
    "uv light with @xmath50 375 nm obtained from a commercial light emitting diode ( led ) was uniformly cast upon the device within a circular area of radius @xmath18 1 mm centered on the sic coated area . in fig .",
    "1(c ) , the dark violet areas arise from the diffuse reflection of ag paste .",
    "the central bright light - blue area arises from the sic pl .    in fig .",
    "1(d ) the optical setup is sketched .",
    "the uv - led was mounted in a view port of the binocular microscope , and the uv light passed through an objective lens and the quartz cryostat window in order to irradiate the sample inside the he - flow cryostat .",
    "the pl was led to the charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera by passing through the same cryostat quartz window , a uv - cut filter and another objective lens .",
    "after passing through a polyethylene cryostat window and a previously described optical chopper@xcite , the sub - thz mesa emission was simultaneously detected by a si - composite bolometer and by a fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) spectrometer ( jasco , faris-1)@xcite , as described in the following and elsewhere.@xcite    the radiation power of the mesa used in this experiment was estimated as follows .",
    "due to the location of the photoluminescence imaging equipment , the incident angle from the sample mesa to the si - bolometer was obliged to be very shallow , about 70@xmath51 from top of the mesa . at this detection angle ,",
    "the signal intensity is strong enough for detection , but is reduced by an order of magnitude from that optimally obtainable .",

    "5(b ) present the direct output values of the lock - in amplifier .",
    "the total radiation power was calculated from its angular dependence as was done previously@xcite .",
    "the responsivity of the si - bolometer used in the present experiments is @xmath1811.0 mv / nw , the solid angle at the distance of 8 cm from the sample to the window of the si - bolometer is 0.005 sr , the preamplifier gain is 200 , the transmission efficiency of the chopper is about 50 % , and accounting for the attenuation of the three quartz windows , the total power was estimated to be @xmath185 @xmath23w .",
    "this value is an order of magnitude lower than the maximum power observed so far .",
    "we noticed that this is due partly to the effect of the sic coating@xcite .",
    "we define @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 to be unit vectors along the mesa s width , length , and height , as sketched in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "then the angle @xmath55 varies from @xmath56 when the emission is along @xmath52 , to @xmath57 when the emission is along @xmath58 . using these coordinates ,",
    "uv light was irradiated at an incident angle of @xmath59 from @xmath54 towards @xmath52 , and the pl and the sub - thz radiation were observed at the angles of @xmath60 from @xmath54 towards @xmath52 , and @xmath61 , or @xmath62 from @xmath54 towards @xmath58 , respectively .      in order to test the uniformity of the sic microcrystalline coverage of mesa a , it was subjected to uv light at @xmath64 k with @xmath47 , and an image of the resulting pl is shown in fig .",
    "it was observed here that the pl intensity on a scale of 10 @xmath18 20 @xmath23 m is not uniform , although the coverage of the sic microcrystals appears rather uniform as seen in fig .",
    "moreover , detailed examination of fig .",
    "2(b ) on the scale of a few @xmath23 m reveals coarse bright regions corresponding to the pl from individual microcrystals . because of the non - uniform pl response and the spotty image due to the coarse microcrystalline grain size , a direct conversion of the observed local pl intensity to @xmath3 maps would result in significant scatter in the @xmath3 map data on such a fine scale .",
    "this artificial noise effect can be minimized as much as possible by dividing the pl image from the microcrystals covering the mesa surface area and its surroundings into 80 @xmath65 350 pixels and individually calibrating the pl intensity measured by each pixel as a function of temperature as described below .    to calibrate the sic pl intensities with @xmath11 , their integrated red , green and blue visible frequency components",
    "are separately measured for 15 k @xmath66 k with @xmath47 and displayed in fig .",
    "2(a ) . since the blue component has the largest @xmath11 sensitivity , it was used for the measurements .",
    "the actual pl images observed from the microcrystals covering mesa a and its surroundings at @xmath28 = 15 k with @xmath47 and @xmath5 = 40.1 ma are shown in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) , respectively .",
    "because of the hot - spot formation due to the local heating , the pl intensity from that region is reduced , in accordance with the local @xmath3 rise , as indicated for @xmath3 with @xmath47 in fig .",
    "2(a ) , yielding the dark region of higher @xmath3 to the right side of the center of the red rectangle in fig .",
    "each of the 80@xmath65350 pixels in the overall image contains the detected pl intensity of each of the three primary colors with 8-bit resolution .",
    "after the pl images were measured during simultaneous sub - thz radiation observations at various bias currents , we took the pl images at @xmath47 at every 4 @xmath67 k under the same uv irradiation conditions , and the blue components of the accumulated images were compared with those of the images taken under an @xmath5 bias at each pixel of the corresponding position one by one to determine the @xmath3 map of the biased mesa .",
    "the spatial and relative @xmath14 resolutions are limited to 2 - 3 @xmath23 m and to a few k , respectively .",
    "figure 2(d ) represents an example of a @xmath3 map of mesa a obtained with @xmath5 = 40.1 ma and @xmath10 = 1.53 v at @xmath28 = 15 k , indicating a hot spot with @xmath29 .",
    "first of all , the maximum @xmath68 of about 120 k at the center @xmath45 of the hot spot is clearly observed , while both mesa edge regions , especially the larger left edge , have @xmath69  40 k , also exceeding @xmath70 15 k. such an extremely non - uniform @xmath3 agrees at least qualitatively with the former ltslm and polymer film results@xcite and even quantitatively with computer simulations@xcite , where the current density of 133 a/@xmath71 in fig .",
    "2(a ) of ref .",
    "[ 29 ] corresponds to @xmath5 = 43 ma for the present mesa .",
    "in contrast to the extremely non - uniform @xmath3 in the lateral directions , we note that the @xmath11 gradient along the @xmath21 axis can primarily be neglected within the mesa height of 2.40 @xmath23 m according to numerical simulations@xcite .",
    "this extremely inhomogeneous @xmath3 can be clearly visualized in fig .",
    "2(e ) , where @xmath72 along the ab line in fig .",
    "2(d ) is shown .",
    "we note that the hot spot is not located at the @xmath5 injection point , indicated by the small red square in fig .",
    "1(a ) , but is shifted by about 10 % of the distance from the center of mesa a to its right end , differing from the ltslm results@xcite , but simulations indicated that this could be a geometrical effect@xcite .",
    "another surprise is that the sub - thz radiation is essentially unaffected by these drastic thermal inhomogeneities , except at ivc points of jumps or disappearances of a hot spot , as noted in section iiib . in fig .",
    "3(a ) the ivcs ( blue curves ) of mesa a at @xmath28 = 35 k biased with a constant @xmath5 mode are shown together with the simultaneous recordings of the si bolometer output @xmath73 versus @xmath10 and @xmath5 , as respectively shown in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 3(c ) .",
    "we note that the amplitude of the background thermal radiation is small , ( @xmath73 @xmath74 0.5 mv at most ) even at @xmath5 = 82 ma , compared with the sub - thz radiation intensity of a few mv as seen in fig .",
    "we recall that this radiation intensity @xmath75 measured by the bolometer is observed at @xmath55 = 70@xmath51 from the @xmath21-axis due to the experimental constraints , which intensity is approximately an order of magnitude reduced from the maximum value that could be observed at some other angle .",
    "the @xmath3 maps at 6 of the more than 20 mapped ivc points are presented as panels h1-h6 in fig .",
    "3(d ) . upon lowering @xmath5 from 82 ma ,",
    "the measurable onset of the sub - thz radiation appears at around @xmath5 = 70 ma corresponding to panel h1 , where the hot spot with @xmath29 occupies more than 85 % of the mesa surface .",
    "the sub - thz radiation intensity then increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath5 , as seen in fig .",

    "the hot - spot area gradually decreases as @xmath5 is reduced . in some cases minor changes in the ivcs",
    "cause the hot - spot center @xmath45 to move dramatically , as if by jumping , as seen by comparing panels h3 and h4 in figs .",
    "3(d ) and 3(e ) .",
    "although a discontinuous change in the sub - thz radiation intensity is associated with dramatic hot - spot center @xmath45 jumps at @xmath5 = 49 ma , the remaining sub - thz emission properties such as the ivcs and @xmath41 are essentially unchanged by jumping of the hot spot position .",
    "such dramatic jumping hot spots are more frequently observed at @xmath28 = 25 k@xcite .",
    "here , we note that the hot spot has a tendency to appear near the mesa center , but the radiation intensity appears to increase when the hot spot moves from the center toward a short edge ( or end ) .",
    "these features will be shown more clearly in a forthcoming publication.@xcite furthermore , as seen by comparing panels h5 and h6 in fig .",
    "3(d ) as well as fig .",
    "3(e ) , the hot spot vanishes rather sharply and transforms to a nearly uniform @xmath3 state as @xmath5 is decreased below 22.4 ma .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the @xmath5-@xmath10 curve has a distinct jump only when the hot spot appears or disappears , but it has only very little effect when the hot spot moves in the mesa .",
    "the intentional manipulation of the hot spot position was reported previously by injecting current into the mesa from different edges or by adjusting the current to multiple electrodes attached at different places to the mesa , which generated the hot spot at different positions@xcite . although those authors observed",

    "this results in an effective increase in @xmath94 and hence in @xmath95 , and normally causes a corresponding increase in @xmath41 as seen in fig .",
    "as @xmath5 decreases from 20 ma to 15 ma , @xmath41 begins to increase rapidly , though @xmath10 only decreases slightly , resulting in a correspondingly stronger decrease in @xmath9 .",
    "below @xmath5 = 15 ma as the retrapping phenomenon occurs repeatedly , @xmath10 correspondingly jumps several times to a lower @xmath10 value before reaching @xmath96 .",
    "note that @xmath97 even in this retrapping region , as previously shown explicitly for the internal ivc branches of different mesas@xcite .",
    "therefore , even in the ir - type radiation region of the ivcs , @xmath97 is still fixed to @xmath10 , but it is not directly related to @xmath5 , as its only relation to @xmath5 is through the ivcs .",
    "hence , we conclude that @xmath97 is satisfied in all radiating ivc regions of every mesa , as expected theoretically .",
    "what is remarkable is that as the thermal condition of the mesa varies dramatically as @xmath5 is varied from 70 ma to 15 ma while holding @xmath28 fixed at 35 k , the large hot spot occupies most of the area of the mesa over the higher-@xmath5 region between 70 ma and 55 ma , the area of the hot spot shrinks gradually over the intermediate range of the current between 55 ma and 23 ma , and at the lower end of the current variation at 22 ma , the hot spot vanishes and the mesa attains a more homogeneous @xmath98 .",
    "although such catastrophic changes in the mesa thermal conditions occur , @xmath97 as seen in fig .",
    "it is even more surprising that the radiation intensity @xmath76 shows a maximum in the middle @xmath5 range near to 35 ma , where intermediate hot - spot @xmath29 areas , 20 - 40 % area of the total area of the mesa surface , are clearly observed .",
    "@xmath3 in that @xmath5 range varies and corresponds roughly to those depicted in panels h3 and h4 in fig .",
    "3(d ) .          for the same mesa a at @xmath28 = 55 k , the ivcs and the radiation characteristics are presented in figs . 5(a ) and 5(b ) , and the associated @xmath3 maps observed at bias points h1-h5 are shown in fig .",
    "although panels h1 and h2 show some weak hot - spot @xmath29 regions , panels h3-h5 do not .",
    "the @xmath72 length profiles for panels h1-h5 shown in fig .",
    "5(d ) are more uniform at @xmath28 = 55 k than are the same mesa profiles at the lower @xmath28 = 35 k shown in fig .",
    "nonetheless , fig .",
    "5(b ) shows that the sub - thz radiation observed by the si - bolometer near the retrapping points corresponding to panels h4 and h5 , is as strong as that observed in the high-@xmath5 bias region at @xmath28 = 35 k. among the hundreds of mesas studied , the strongest emission of a few tens of @xmath23w was observed in such low-@xmath5 bias retrapping regions at around @xmath28 = 55 k@xcite .",
    "the sub - thz frequency measurements show that @xmath99 either in the high-@xmath5 bias hot - spot region at low @xmath28 values or in the low-@xmath5 bias retrapping region at high @xmath28 values .",
    "these observations clearly support the hypothesis that a hot spot neither enhances the radiation intensity nor alters the relation @xmath99 for the intense emission . in other words the hot spot and the emission exhibit a non - mutualistic coexistence , contrary to previous interpretations@xcite .    besides",
    ", in the high-@xmath5 bias regime , it was shown experimentally that the line width @xmath100 decreases dramatically with increasing @xmath28@xcite and decreasing the dc input power @xmath101 , implying that the ijj synchronization increases dramatically with increasing @xmath28 and decreasing @xmath101 .",
    "if hot spots were the main source of the remarkable high-@xmath5 bias synchronization , one would expect that stronger hot spots would lead to greater synchronization .",
    "thus , we conclude that the hot spot probably does not provide the primary mechanism for the synchronization of the ijjs for the sub - thz emission . although previous workers presented convincing evidence that the overall emission line width was by far the narrowest in the high-@xmath5 bias r - type regions such as pictured in panels h5 of fig .",
    "3(d ) containing a hot spot , and concluded that the hot spot might account for the very high degree of synchronization of the emission from the many ijjs@xcite , our experiments and the simulations of gross _ et al . _",
    "do not provide support for that conclusion@xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable to suppose that the normal central hot - spot region in the mesa in the high-@xmath5 bias region would decrease the overall coherence of the radiation emitted from the two separate superconducting regions , unfavorable for the synchronization between the two divided superconducting regions .",
    "however , we still ca nt completely exclude the possibility that a hot spot might alter the sub - thz emission synchronization conditions , such as the impedance matching conditions , since ( a ) synchronization processes are highly non - linear and thus poorly understood , and ( b ) the hot spot could act as a variable shunt resistor , modifying the effective impedance for the radiation@xcite , _",
    "etc_.      more specifically , our sic microcrystalline pl measurement technique did not provide any signs of standing - wave formation in @xmath3 maps between @xmath28 = 15 k and 60 k@xcite , although only two of those map sets are shown here .",
    "these results are in sharp contrast to those obtained by ltslm and in some high-@xmath5 embedded - film observations , in which those different experimental techniques also observed standing waves in addition to hot spots@xcite .",
    "_ suggested that the wavy features in the ltslm images could be regarded as standing magnetic field waves@xcite .",
    "_ suggested that an edge of the hot spot could act as a reflective cavity termination plane responsible for such standing waves forming along the length of the rectangular mesa@xcite .",
    "this propagation direction is inconsistent with our observations , because the radiation frequency @xmath41 nearly always obeys the tm(1,0 ) em cavity resonance frequency @xmath102 for a standing wave across the rectangular mesa width @xmath43@xcite , independent of the size and location of the hot spot .",
    "furthermore , since the length of the superconducting region of the mesa , the effective em cavity dimension @xmath103 in their model , becomes larger as @xmath5 is decreased , @xmath41 should decrease continuously , in contrast with their observations@xcite . in our observations @xmath41 remains invariant even during a sudden jump in the hot - spot center position@xcite . in our simultaneous spectroscopic radiation observations , @xmath41 is completely unrelated to the hot spot s size and position , but is primarily determined by the @xmath104-josephson relation @xmath97 and secondarily by @xmath105 . in the present case",
    "the emission was observed for 0.41 @xmath106 0.76 thz .",
    "finally , we discuss briefly the secondary condition important for the intensity of the sub - thz radiation : the rectangular em cavity resonance condition @xmath42 for the rectangular mesa .",
    "hence , @xmath107 for mesas of the same @xmath108 is thus determined purely by @xmath43 .",
    "however , since the rather poor quality @xmath109-value of the em cavity is of the order of @xmath1810 due to the trapezoidal cross section of the mesa width , the actual em cavity resonance has a broad frequency characteristic , approximately @xmath1850 ghz at the central frequency of 0.5 thz@xcite . in the present mesa",
    "@xmath43 varies from 79 @xmath23 m at the top of the mesa to 89 @xmath23 m at the bottom , leading to the expected range of @xmath107 values from 0.42 to 0.48 thz . in fact as seen by comparing figs .",
    "4(b ) and 4(c ) , this secondary radiation mechanism appears to work quite well , since the strongest enhancement of the radiation is observed in this limited @xmath41 region , which is shown by the shaded yellow highlighted region in fig .",
    "however , in contrast to this scenario , much weaker radiation can be observed both above 55 ma and below 22 ma . for these faint radiation regions , the cavity resonance condition appears to be violated , even though the ac - josephson relation is still fulfilled .",
    "the thz radiation occurring without a good cavity resonance condition can naturally be understood by a mismatch of the standing wave of length @xmath110 across the mesa width on which the above formula for @xmath107 was based .",
    "this confirms that the cavity resonance condition only plays a secondary role in the thz radiation mechanism , as shown previously@xcite .",
    "note that it also works as an important component to the overall mechanism for the synchronization of the ijjs and the power enhancement .",
    "in conclusion , an extremely inhomogeneous temperature distribution of the sub - thz emitting mesa consisting of the intrinsic josephson junctions in the high-@xmath0 superconductor @xmath111 was directly observed from the high spatial resolution of the photoluminescence of many uniformly attached sic microcrystals during simultaneous spectroscopic sub - thz radiation measurements .",
    "this hot - spot temperature distribution was free of any apparent standing waves .",
    "since the hot spots weaken the sub - thz radiation power , the two phenomena appear to coexist non - mutualistically .",
    "a hot - spot phase synchronization mechanism therefore appears improbable .",
