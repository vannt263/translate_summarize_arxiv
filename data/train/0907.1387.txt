    "yau s proof of calabi s conjecture @xcite and donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau s proof of the existence of hermite - einstein metrics on stable holomorphic vector bundles @xcite , are main examples of such theorems .",
    "although only very rarely does one expect to find explicit formulae for the solutions , one can explore the geometry of the solutions using numerical methods . during the last years",
    ", several techniques that approximate khler - einstein and hermite - einstein metrics have appeared in the literature , mainly due to @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we begin numerical work to study weil - petersson metrics on moduli spaces of such solutions .",
    "the main focus is on moduli spaces of complex structures on polarized calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "first , we develop a fast algorithm that computes the metric by evaluating numerically the exact weil - petersson formula . secondly , by using donaldson s quantization link between infinite and finite g.i.t quotients , we introduce a sequence of khler metrics .",
    "we prove that the sequence converges to the weil - petersson metric on moduli of manifolds that carry khler metrics with constant scalar curvature ( csck metrics in short ) .",
    "finally , we introduce an algorithm that computes such metrics and discuss an example .",
    "we hope this work illuminates the techniques and difficulties that appear when approximating weil - petersson metrics on more general moduli spaces .",
    "motivation for this work can be found in different sources .",
    "for instance , we find specially motivating the program by douglas et",
    "@xcite , building on the work by donaldson @xcite , to numerically compute khler metrics that appear in calabi - yau compactifications of string theory . other source of motivation comes from the study of global weil - petersson geometry on moduli spaces of calabi - yau manifolds , @xcite . in this case",
    ", one of the algorithms introduced in this paper should allow to estimate weil - petersson volumes of moduli spaces in a sensible amount of time and with reasonable precision .",
    "many approaches to unify particle physics attemp to describe known physics by considering a simple field theory defined on a higher dimensional space , and taking four - dimensional limits .",
    "the idea , today known as compactification of a field theory , has inspired much work in the interface between geometry and physics . determining the action functional for fields , in four - dimensional limits , and for a large family of compactifications ,",
    "is the main mathematical motivation for this work .    for the purpose of this introduction , by a _ field theory _ we mean a functional space @xmath1 of geometric data on a manifold @xmath2 ( such as riemannian metrics , connections on a principal bundle on @xmath2 , sections of vector bundles ,  ) , with an action functional @xmath3 defined on it .",
    "a compactification is then a field theory on a @xmath4-dimensional space - time which is the product of the @xmath5-dimensional space - time @xmath6 with a @xmath7-dimensional manifold @xmath8 , the compactification manifold , carrying a riemannian metric and other geometric structure corresponding to other fields in the theory .",
    "these must solve the euler - langrange equations associated to @xmath9 , and preserve four dimensional poincar invariance .",
    "the most general metric ansatz for a poincar invariant compactification is @xmath10 where the tangent space indices are @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the minkowski metric , @xmath15 is a metric on @xmath8 , and @xmath16 is a real valued function on @xmath8 . as the simplest example , consider the @xmath4-dimensional hilbert - einstein action for general relativity . in this case ,",
    "einstein s equations reduce to ricci flatness of @xmath17 . given our metric ansatz , this requires @xmath16 to be constant , and the metric @xmath15 on @xmath8 to be ricci flat .",
    "typically , if a manifold admits a ricci flat metric , it will not be unique ; rather there will be a moduli space of such metrics .",
    "physically , one then expects to find solutions in which the choice of ricci flat metric on @xmath8 is slowly varying in four dimensional space - time .",
    "general arguments imply that such variations must be described by variations of @xmath5-dimensional fields , governed by an eft . for simplicity , by this _",
    "effective field theory _ ( eft ) we mean a four dimensional field theory that emerges in the small radius limit of @xmath8 , when the geometric data on @xmath18 restricted to @xmath8 satisfies the euler lagrange equations .",
    "thus , the action functional of the eft is defined on a functional space of geometric data on @xmath6 .",
    "given an explicit parametrization of the family of metrics , say @xmath19 for some parameters @xmath20 , the eft could be computed explicitly by promoting the parameters @xmath21 to @xmath5-dimensional fields @xmath22 , substituting this parametrization into the @xmath4-dimensional action , and expanding in powers of the @xmath5-dimensional derivatives . for the hilbert - einstein action",
    ", we find the four - dimensional effective action functional @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes a local coordinate chart on @xmath8 , @xmath25 a local coordinate chart on @xmath6 , and @xmath26 is the scalar curvature associated to the @xmath4 dimensional metric . in general , a direct computation of is impossible .",
    "this becomes especially clear when one learns that the ricci flat metrics @xmath15 are not explicitly known for the examples of interest .",
    "an interesting class of compactifications come from the field theory limit of string theories , where the space - time dimension is @xmath27 . requiring @xmath28 supersymmetry on the four dimensional eft and the vanishing of torsion elements , fixes @xmath8 to be a calabi - yau threefold . in this case , computing the four dimensional action functional for the @xmath22 fields involves to know the weil - petersson metric on the moduli space of khler ricci flat metrics on @xmath8 .",
    "these theories contain other objects besides the space - time metric .",
    "for instance , in a heterotic string theory @xcite , the geometric content also involves a principal @xmath29-bundle endowed with a gauge connection @xmath30 ; @xmath31 denotes the cartan s exceptional simple lie group of dimension @xmath32 . in a poincar invariant compactification",
    ", one defines the theory on a principal @xmath29-bundle @xmath33 . for every point @xmath34 on @xmath8 ,",
    "the restriction of the principal bundle @xmath35 to @xmath36 is trivial , i.e. @xmath37 is equivalent to @xmath38 . in the small radius limit of @xmath8 one",
    "obtains an effective gauge theory on @xmath6 with gauge group @xmath39 , by expanding the yang - mills functional around a background reducible connection @xmath40 on @xmath33 . for simplicity , one considers a subgroup @xmath41 of @xmath31 and takes @xmath40 to be a connection on a principal @xmath41-subbundle of @xmath33 . the gauge group @xmath39 of the effective theory on @xmath6 is the commutant of @xmath42 . in many applications",
    "@xmath41 is the special unitary group @xmath43 , with @xmath44 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations associated to the yang - mills functional require @xmath40 to be a hermite yang - mills unitary connection .    as in the case of the khler ricci flat metric ,",
    "if the bundle admits a hermite yang - mills connection , it will not be unique ; rather there will be a moduli space of @xmath31 connections on @xmath35 with @xmath41-holonomy .",
    "although a general description of such moduli spaces is not explicitly known for examples of interest , it is interesting enough to work with the space of local deformations around a particular @xmath40 .",
    "such space is in one to one correspondence with the null space of the dirac operator on @xmath8 , coupled to @xmath40 , that acts on spinors which are sections of an associated vector bundle to @xmath35 , adjoint representation of @xmath31 .",
    "the decomposition of such null space as the direct sum of irreducible representations of @xmath39 , corresponds to the particle spectrum in the four dimensional effective theory ( see table 1 ) .    .",
    "a vector bundle @xmath45 with structure group @xmath41 can break the @xmath31 gauge group of the heterotic string into great unification theory groups @xmath39 , such as @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "the particle spectrum is obtained by computing the indicated sheaf cohomology groups . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      equipped with equations , and the monte carlo integration technique just described , one can estimate weil - petersson metrics for a large class of families .",
    "for instance , one can compute the metric on the modulus of quintic 3-folds introduced above , @xmath52 and studied independently by @xcite . by generating 2,000,000 points we evaluated the weil - petersson metric at the fermat point @xmath53 : @xmath54 with @xmath55 the standard error .",

    "this method is highly inefficent despite is much simpler to implement . as an example , if we evaluate the function @xmath59 for 300 random values of @xmath57 near @xmath53 with 100,000 points on each 3-fold @xmath60 , and fit a quadratic function around the fermat point , we find that the hessian at @xmath53 is @xmath61 in other words , by using 15 times more points than in , we evaluate @xmath62 with an error 30 times bigger . in fig .",

    "in this section , starting from the basics of moduli spaces of polarized manifolds , we explain how one can construct a discrete set up to approximate weil - petersson metrics .",
    "first of all , moduli of polarized varieties can be constructed as an infinite dimensional symplectic quotient @xcite .",
    "let us consider the infinite dimensional space of complex structures @xmath63 which make @xmath64 khler , and certain complexification of the group of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms @xmath65 .",
    "if one assumes @xmath66 for simplicity , @xmath65 consists in the set of diffeomorphisms of @xmath8 such that the pullback of @xmath67 is compatible with the complex structure @xmath68 : @xmath69 the `` quotient '' of @xmath70 by @xmath65 is the set of isomorphism classes of integrable complex structures on @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , the khler structure on @xmath8 induces one on @xmath70 by integration .",
    "if @xmath8 is endowed with a ricci flat metric , such khler form is compatible with the weil - petersson metric on the space of metrics .",
    "the associated symplectic form is preserved by @xmath72 , hence one can ask for a moment map . fujiki and",
    "donaldson showed that @xmath73 with @xmath74 the scalar curvature and @xmath75 its average over @xmath8 .",
    "thus , for manifolds @xmath8 with trivial canonical bundle , the zeros of the moment map correspond to khler ricci flat metrics .      in @xcite",
    ", donaldson showed how this previous infinite dimensional quotient should be thought as the classical limit of a finite dimensional construction .",
    "+ let us fix a polynomial @xmath76 $ ] of degree @xmath77 . one can consider the set @xmath78 formed by couples @xmath79 such that @xmath80 is a projective variety of complex dimension @xmath77 and @xmath81 a polarization with euler - poincar characteristic @xmath82 satisfying @xmath83 for @xmath84 large enough . for each element @xmath79 of @xmath85 ,",
    "one obtains an embedding ( which is not unique ! ) in a fixed projective space @xmath86 for @xmath84 large enough , because @xmath78 is a bounded family .",
    "thus any projective calabi - yau manifold ( or variety ) @xmath87 defines a point in @xmath78 for a suitable choice of @xmath88 . from grothendieck",
    "s results @xcite , there is a quasi - projective scheme @xmath89 containing @xmath78 , the hilbert scheme of subschemes of @xmath90 with fixed hilbert polynomial @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , there is a universal family @xmath91 over @xmath89 such that @xmath92 , i.e. one has the diagram @xmath93 let us consider @xmath94 the subset of @xmath78 formed by smooth projective manifolds .",
    "hence , one can consider a natural khler structure on @xmath94 by pulling - back the fubini - study form from @xmath90 : @xmath95).\\ ] ] this corresponds to write at the point @xmath96 , @xmath97 with @xmath98 vector fields along @xmath99 , normal to the subspace defined by the infinitesimal action of @xmath100 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath101 denotes the space of smooth @xmath102 vector fields on @xmath90 restricted to @xmath103 , then @xmath101 decomposes , under the @xmath104 metric inherited from @xmath105 on @xmath90 , as a direct sum @xmath106 here , @xmath107 denotes the standard infinitesimal action of @xmath100 on @xmath90 restricted to @xmath103 .",

    "for those manifolds , there exists an embedding for which the center of mass with respect to the fubini - study form is zero .",
    "one can reformulate this by considering two natural maps on the space of metrics over @xmath118 and the space of metrics over @xmath114 :    * the hilbertian map , @xmath119 such that @xmath120 with @xmath121 the curvature of @xmath122 . * the injective fubini - study map , @xmath123 such that @xmath124 where @xmath125 is an @xmath39-orthonormal basis of holomorphic sections of @xmath114 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath126 corresponds to the existence of a hermitian metric @xmath127 on the vector space @xmath114 such that @xmath128 , i.e to a fixed point of the map @xmath129 where @xmath130    we say that a fixed point @xmath131 of the @xmath132-map is a balanced metric of order @xmath84 .",
    "we will also say that the induced metrics @xmath133 and @xmath134 are balanced .    in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that for any smooth manifold @xmath8 with a csck metric in the class @xmath135 and with @xmath136 group discrete , there exists a balanced metric @xmath137 for @xmath84 sufficiently large .",
    "the sequence of khler forms @xmath138 converges , in @xmath139 topology and when @xmath140 , to the unique csck metric in its class .",
    "moreover , the @xmath132 map admits a unique attractive fixed point , the balanced metric @xmath127 and the iteration of the @xmath132 map converges exponentially fast to the balanced metric . in this way one can obtain a complete analog of the infinite dimensional quotient",
    "@xmath141 defined above , using a finite dimensional framework .",
    "the idea of approximating khler metrics by fubini - study metrics via projective _ balanced _ embeddings , goes back to @xcite .    from now",
    ", we will restrict our attention to the smooth orbits of the moduli space @xmath142 . in the case of polarized calabi - yau manifolds , the dimension of this quotient is given by @xmath143 , i.e. elements of @xmath144 that keep the polarization @xmath145 invariant .",
    "thus , @xmath146 is strictly included in the kuranishi space of deformations of the manifold , leaving some non - algebraic deformations .",

    "we consider local algebraic deformations of the complex structure on @xmath8 , which correspond to tangent vectors in @xmath146 .",

    "as the formula would become the weil - petersson metric if @xmath511 was hermite - einstein , as in @xcite , one expects that if @xmath511 is balanced , eq . should converge to the weil - petersson metric in the @xmath512 limit .",
    "we have implemented an algorthim to compute this metric on the family of quintics that we have studied in this paper .",
    "as one can see in eq . , it is slightly more difficult to implement this formula numerically due to the higher number of derivatives .",
    "also , the numerical calculation itself is much slower in comparison with a numerical evaluation of .",
    "for instance , to compute the metric for @xmath513 took as much time as computing for @xmath483 . due to problems with the speed of the numerical calculation , we decided not to resume a detailed analysis of a numerical method based on eq . .",
    "many other problems could be studied in further depth using our approach to compute numerical weil - petersson metrics . for instance , as an application , one could try to estimate the weil - petersson volume of the moduli space of calabi - yau quintics .",
