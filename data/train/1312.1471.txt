    "the electronic properties of quantum dots ( qds ) in graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice @xcite have been studied extensively due to their unique properties and their potential for applications in graphene devices @xcite .",
    "since klein tunneling prevents electrostatic confinement in graphene , direct etching of the graphene sheet is perhaps the only viable option for quantum confinement . in such systems , controlling the shape and edges of the dot remains an important challenge but the exact configuration of the edges is unknown @xcite .",
    "the latter is important because the energy spectrum depends strongly on the type of edges @xcite .",
    "two coupled layers of graphene , called bilayer graphene ( blg ) , have quite distinct properties from those of a single layer .",
    "in pristine blg the spectrum is gapless and is approximately parabolic at low energies around the two nonequivalent points in the brillouin zone ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . in a perpendicular electric field ,",
    "the spectrum displays a gap which can be tuned by varying the bias @xcite .",
    "nanostructuring the gate would allow tuning of the energy gap in blg which can be used to electrostatically confine qds @xcite and quantum rings @xcite . here",
    "the electrons are displaced from the edge of the sample and consequently edge disorder and the specific type of edges are no longer a problem .",
    "such gate defined qds in blg were recently fabricated by different groups @xcite , who demonstrated experimentally the confinement of electrons and coulomb blockade .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the energy levels of a parabolic qd in blg in the presence of coulomb interaction . here",
    "we consider the two - electron problem as the most simple case to investigate the effect of electron - electron correlations .",
    "similar studies have been reported for semiconducting qds over the last two decades @xcite and recently for graphene qds @xcite and graphene rings @xcite . at present",
    "no similar study has been reported for blg quantum dots .",
    "an important issue for graphene structures is the extra valley - index degree of freedom where the electrons have the possibility to be in the same valley or in different valleys @xcite .",
    "here we show that the competition between the valley - index and the electron spin leads to unique behaviors that shed light on the fundamental properties of the ground state energy of blg quantum dots .",
    "in order to find the single - particle energy spectrum of a parabolic qd we employ a four - band continuum model to describe the blg sheet . in the valley - isotropic form @xcite ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 mev is the inter - layer coupling term .",

    "@xcite .    for large magnetic fields the eigenstates are strongly localized at the origin of the dot , where @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum approaches the landau levels ( lls ) of an unbiased blg ( black dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) and consequently some of the energy levels approach @xmath43 as the field increases .",

    "the energy spectrum also displays the @xmath44 symmetry , which is another feature that is unique to blg quantum dots .",

    "the singularity due to the @xmath67 term in the matrix elements is avoided by using an alternative expression in terms of the legendre function of the second kind of half - integer degree @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show two representative spectra for two interacting electrons in a blg quantum dot with radius ( a ) @xmath68 nm , and ( b ) @xmath36 nm , and @xmath35 mev . to clearly see the effect of electron correlations , the spectra for two non - interacting electrons in a dot with @xmath36 nm",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) for comparison .",
    "the levels are labeled by @xmath69 with @xmath70 the total angular momentum , @xmath71 the total valley index , and @xmath72 the total spin .",
    "energy levels with the same @xmath73 are drawn using the same type of curve .",
    "two electrons can form a non - degenerate singlet state ( @xmath74 ) and a three - fold degenerate triplet state ( @xmath75 ) . in case",
    "the quantum number @xmath72 is omitted , the singlet and triplet states are degenerate . in the following discussion it is useful to characterize the many - body state by the single particle basis function in expression ( [ psi12 ] ) which has the largest contribution .",
    "we denote the basis function in which the first and second electron have , respectively , angular momentum @xmath76 and @xmath77 and valley index @xmath78 and @xmath79 as @xmath80 .    the spectra of the two interacting electrons in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) are a result of three competing effects .",
    "it is evident that the energy of the single particle states as function of the magnetic field , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , determines partly the spectrum .",
    "however , turning on the coulomb interaction between the electrons changes the spectrum drastically .",
    "while the non - interacting state @xmath81 is the ground state , the many - body interacting state in which this single particle basis function has the largest contribution is an excited state and does not even appear in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) .",
    "instead the many - body state @xmath82 is the ground state for small magnetic field values , with the main contribution @xmath83 .",
    "the coulomb interaction is clearly not a small perturbation . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , the evolution of the average distance between both electrons is shown for different single particle basis states ( for the @xmath36 nm case ) .",
    "this difference in the average distance can be understood from the single particle densities . while single particle states @xmath84 and @xmath85 have a non - zero density in the origin , the density of the single particle state @xmath86 is zero in the origin .",
    "therefore , this average distance is much larger , and consequently the coulomb interaction is much lower , for the basis function @xmath87 than for @xmath88 , which is the reason why the many - body state @xmath82 has a lower energy .",
    "a more subtle effect is played by the exchange interaction .",
    "as mentioned , the ground state at small magnetic field values is given by the many - body state @xmath82 , which is a triplet state .",
    "the corresponding singlet state @xmath89 is slightly higher in energy .",
    "also note that the state @xmath90 , with the main single particle contribution @xmath91 is higher in energy at small magnetic fields , although the coulomb interaction contribution is expected to be very similar ( compare curves @xmath82 and @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ) .",
    "the reason is again the exchange interaction energy gain for the triplet state @xmath82 .",
    "state @xmath90 is fourfold degenerate : the triplet configuration does not lead to an exchange energy gain because both electrons occupy different valleys . only for larger magnetic field values ,",
    "the state @xmath90 takes over from the state @xmath82 to become the ground state .",
    "this is caused by the evolution of the single particle energies .",
    "the next state that becomes the ground state with increasing magnetic field is the singlet @xmath92 , with main single particle contribution @xmath93 .",
    "because twice the same single particle level is occupied , no exchange energy gain is possible .",
    "nevertheless , this state becomes the ground state due to the evolution of the single particle energies , together with the fact that the average distance between both electrons is even smaller ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ) , as both electrons occupy a single particle level with zero density in the origin . with increasing field ,",
    "it becomes beneficial for an electron to jump from the single particle level @xmath86 to the single particle level @xmath94 , resulting in the triplet state @xmath95 with main contribution @xmath96 .    while in conventional semiconductor qds",
    ", the ground state shows a series of singlet to triplet transitions as function of the magnetic field strength @xcite , a more complex phase diagram is found for blg qds . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) we plot this phase diagram for the same @xmath97 and dielectric constant as used for fig .",
    "[ fig3](a , b ) . for small magnetic field values",
    ", the ground state is found to be a triplet state . with increasing field",
    "a valley transition occurs , resulting in a fourfold - degenerate state .",
    "next , again a valley transition occurs into a singlet state . further increasing the magnetic field favors again a triplet state .",
    "( b ) for ( a ) @xmath98 and ( b ) @xmath99 and for @xmath38 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 t. the upper insets show the total pair - correlation function for @xmath38 t and @xmath102 t. the lower insets show separate parts of the pair - correlation function for @xmath38 .",

    "[ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) , respectively for the @xmath90 and @xmath95 states , of a two - electron blg quantum dot with @xmath36 nm , @xmath35 mev , and for three values of the external magnetic field @xmath105 t. comparing the density profiles in ( a ) and ( b ) , the maximum of the density is shifted towards higher radial distance in the state @xmath95 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the electrons in the many - particle @xmath95 state occupy single - particle states with higher angular momentum . as the magnetic field increases ,",
    "the electrons are pulled closer towards the center of the dot .",
    "the upper insets in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) show the total pair - correlation function @xmath106 , for @xmath38 t and @xmath102 t. the @xmath107 , and @xmath108 terms refer respectively to the contribution of the sublattices in the same layer and in the different layers . in the lower insets",
    "the terms @xmath107 and @xmath108 are plotted separately for @xmath38 t which respectively indicate the probability to find the second electron in the same layer , or in the other layer if the first electron is fixed at a certain point .",
    "the transition energies are labeled by their final states : @xmath69 for the triplet ( or singlet ) states and @xmath32 for the degenerate single - triplet states .",
    "levels having the same total valley index are plotted using the same type of curve.,width=302 ]    in cyclotron resonance experiments , transitions are induced between the ground state and excited states .",
    "for the blg quantum dot the selection rule on the change of total momentum @xmath109 is still fulfilled .",
    "this is apparent when we calculate the transition energies and the corresponding transition rates for dipole transitions using the relation @xmath110 .",
    "this relation also implies conservation of the total spin , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "the valley degree of freedom dictates new transition rules for blg quantum dots , i.e. , @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "this means that those transitions are possible in which at least one electron remains in the same valley during the transition .",
    "the lowest possible transition energies for a two - electron quantum dot with @xmath36 nm and @xmath31 mev are shown in fig .",
    "the possible transitions are labeled by the final states ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the discontinuities between the transition energies at @xmath115 t , @xmath115 t and @xmath116 t are due to the valley and singlet - triplet transitions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the energy levels , the electron density , the pair correlation function and the cyclotron transition energies of electrostatically confined qds containing one or two electrons in a blg .",
    "such qds can be realized experimentally by using nanostructured gate potentials on a blg .",
    "in contrast to conventional semiconductor qds , we found that the ground state energy of the two - electron spectrum exhibits a valley transition rather than a spin singlet - triplet transition .",
    "this is due to the extra valley degree of freedom in blg in which the electrons can be in different valleys and thereby allowing the four - degenerate single - triplet states as the ground state .",
    "experimental confirmation of our prediction can come from spin susceptibility measurements .",

    "is supported by the canada research chairs program of the government of canada .",
    "the total single particle wave functions can be expressed as a superposition of the contribution of the two valleys via the bloch wave function , i.e. @xmath117 and @xmath118 . when both electrons are in the same valley the bloch terms cancel each other and when the electrons belong to different valleys the corresponding matrix element becomes zero @xmath119 .",
    "thus the bloch wave functions are not important when constructing the matrix elements ."
