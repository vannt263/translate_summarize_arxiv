    "ultracold samples of bi - alkali polar molecules have been created very recently in their ground electronic @xmath7 , vibrational @xmath8 , and rotational @xmath9 states  @xcite .",
    "this is a promising step before achieving bose - einstein condensates or degenerate fermi gases of polar molecules , provided that further evaporative cooling is efficient . for this purpose",
    ", elastic collision rates must be much faster than inelastic quenching rates .",
    "this issue is somewhat problematic for the bi - alkali molecules recently created , since they are subject to quenching via chemical reactions .",
    "if a reaction should occur , the products are no longer trapped .    for alkali dimers that possess electric dipole moments , elastic scattering appears to be quite favorable , since elastic scattering rates are expected to scale with the fourth power of the dipole moment  @xcite .",
    "inelastic collisions of polar species can originate from two distinct sources .",
    "the long - range dipole - dipole interaction itself is anisotropic and can cause dipole orientations to be lost .",
    "this kind of loss generally leads to high inelastic rates , and is regarded as the reason why electrostatic trapping of polar molecules is likely not feasible  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these collisions also scale as the fourth power of dipole moment in the ultracold limit  @xcite , meaning that the ratio of elastic to inelastic rates does not in general improve at higher electric fields .",
    "this sort of loss can be prevented by trapping the molecules in optical dipole traps .",
    "more serious is the possibility that collisions are quenched by chemical reactions .",
    "chemical reaction rates are known to be potentially quite high even at ultracold temperatures  @xcite . indeed , for collision energies above the bethe  wigner threshold regime",
    ", it appears that many quenching rates , chemical or otherwise , of barrierless systems are well described by applying langevin s classical model  @xcite . in this model",
    "the molecules must surmount a centrifugal barrier to pass close enough to react , but are assumed to react with unit probability when they do so .",
    "this model has adequately described several cold molecule quantum dynamics calculations  @xcite .    within the bethe  wigner limit , scattering can be described by an elegant quantum defect theory ( qdt ) approach  @xcite .",
    "this approach makes explicit the dominant role of long - range forces in controlling how likely the molecules are to approach close to one another .",
    "consequently , quenching rate constants can often be written in an analytic form that contains a small number of parameters that characterize short - range physics such as chemical reaction probability . for processes in which the quenching probability is close to unity",
    ", the qdt theory provides remarkably accurate quenching rates  @xcite . for dipoles",
    ", however , the full qdt theory remains to be formulated .    in this article",
    "we combine two powerful ideas  suppression of collisions due to long - range physics , and high - probability quenching inelastic collisions for those that are not suppressed  to derive simple estimates for inelastic / reactive scattering rates for ultracold fermionic dipoles .",
    "the theory arrives at remarkably simple expressions of collision rates , without the need for the full machinery of close - coupling calculations .",
    "strikingly , the model shows that quenching collisions scale as the _ sixth _ power of the dipole moment for ultracold @xmath3wave collisions . on the one hand",
    ", this implies a tremendous degree of control over chemical reactions by simply varying an electric field , complementing alternative proposals for electric field control of molecule - molecule  @xcite or atom - molecule  @xcite chemistry . on the other hand",
    ", it also implies that evaporative cooling of polar molecules may become more difficult as the field is increased . in section",

    "for quenching collisions , the threshold laws  @xcite state that @xmath71 . for @xmath72 , a classical capture model will guarantee to deliver the molecule pair to small values of @xmath50 , where chemical reactions are likely to occur with unit probability ( see fig .",
    "[ spag - fig ] ) . following this classical argument",

    "using this assumption together with the quantum threshold laws , the qt quenching tunneling probability below the barrier can be written as @xmath75 consequently , the quenching cross section and rate coefficient are approximated by @xmath76 for @xmath69 .",

    "note that the model will not be appropriate in the present form for barrierless ( @xmath78wave ) collisions since @xmath79 .",
