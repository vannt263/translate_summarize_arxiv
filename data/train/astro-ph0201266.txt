    "io s atmosphere plays a key role in populating the jovian magnetosphere with plasma and replenishing the plasma torus with sulfur and oxygen @xcite .",
    "this tenuous atmosphere , first detected by the voyager 1 iris experiment over 20 years ago @xcite , has proven to be a challenge to characterize quantitatively .",
    "it is composed primarily of so@xmath7 @xcite and so @xcite .",
    "the atomic by - products of so@xmath7 , sulfur and oxygen , were first identified in the io plasma torus @xcite , and more recently detected in io s emission line spectrum @xcite .",
    "sodium @xcite and potassium @xcite are also present at much lower abundance than sulfur and oxygen .",
    "the observed emissions are produced when the atmospheric sulfur and oxygen are collisionally excited by impinging electrons from the plasma torus .",
    "the emissions are therefore diagnostic of the plasma interaction with io s atmosphere , providing quantitative information about the electron temperature and density , in addition to the abundances of sulfur and oxygen .    despite the recent advances in quantifying io s atmosphere , including investigating the inhomogeneity and impact of volcanic activity @xcite , analyzing the airglow @xcite , and resolving the morphology @xcite , and the fact that several sets of sulfur and oxygen emission line data have been acquired and analyzed @xcite , the abundances are still not well constrained .",
    "various observational measurements and theoretical models have placed loose bounds on the sulfur column density ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "previously , electron densities and temperatures were assumed in order to estimate @xmath10 , resulting in limits of 2.2@xmath210@xmath3@xmath117@xmath210@xmath9@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recent observations make both optically thick and optically thin regimes available in a single exposure , allowing us to constrain @xmath10 without assuming a specific @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "we present such a temperature and density independent method for determining the column density in this paper .",
    "sulfur and oxygen abundances also provide a little - utilized diagnostic of the origin and nature of the so@xmath7 atmosphere .",
    "significant progress has been made in characterizing both the spatial distribution and temporal variability of the so@xmath7 atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the current picture includes a higher column density equatorial , sub - solar region , @xmath141 - 5@xmath210@xmath15@xmath6 , with a strong poleward gradient , where @xmath16 decreases to @xmath1710@xmath9@xmath6 @xcite and column densities @xmath1810@xmath15@xmath6 above active volcanic regions @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that both active volcanism and so@xmath7 frost sublimation are important atmospheric sources , although the relative importance of each mechanism has not been determined @xcite .",
    "the models show that sulfur can serve as a proxy for so@xmath7 , with enhanced abundance relative to oxygen during and shortly after volcanic activity as compared to a sublimation atmosphere .",
    "sulfur displays similar trends as , and scales well with , the so@xmath7 abundance in most of the dayside models . determining and monitoring the sulfur abundance , can , in principle , provide a much - needed measure of the variability of io s atmosphere .",
    "we describe the observations and explain the data reduction in section 2 .",
    "we then give the motivation for and present the analysis of the opacity of the sulfur transitions and the atomic sulfur column density in section 3 .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our findings in section 4 .",
    "the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has made it possible to study the sulfur emission near 1479  in detail .",
    "the allowed multiplet , @xmath01479 ( 3s@xmath193p@xmath204s@xmath21d@xmath223s@xmath193p@xmath23p ) , and the intercombination multiplet , ] @xmath01479 ( 3s@xmath193p@xmath203d@xmath24d@xmath223s@xmath193p@xmath23p ) , are both present in the data and are resolved for the first time .",
    "the analysis that follows focuses on the separation of the @xmath01479 multiplets and its implications .",
    "additional data collected with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) , from 1986 - 1988 , and the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on hst , from 1992 - 1996 , are re - examined in light of the stis data .",
    "we present only one representative spectrum per instrument in this paper .",
    "we concentrate specifically on the following sulfur emission multiplets : the intercombination and allowed multiplets at @xmath01479 , the allowed multiplet @xmath01814 ( 3s@xmath193p@xmath204s@xmath25s@xmath223s@xmath193p@xmath23p ) , and the intercombination doublet ] @xmath01900 ( 3s@xmath193p@xmath204s@xmath26s@xmath223s@xmath193p@xmath23p ) . for all but the 1479  multiplet",
    ", there are several years of data that confirm the trends and ratios found in our analysis .",
    "table 1 summarizes the data analyzed , with the observations presented in this paper shown in bold .",
    "the morphology of the stis observations is identical to that described in @xcite , with resolved bright auroral emission regions near the io equator at both sub- and anti - jupiter locations .",
    "the equatorial spots are not resolved in the other observations presented here .",
    "the primary data set we analyze was acquired with stis on hst using the 52@xmath272@xmath28 slit and the g140 m grating , which produces a monochromatic image of io at each emission line detected in the spectral range 1440 - 1500 .",
    "the set contains four @xmath2919 minute exposures taken on 1998 august 21 - 22 while io was near western elongation , io orbital longitude 285@xmath30 - 305@xmath30 .",
    "the coadded flux spectrum of the first two exposures is presented in figure 1 .",
    "the data are acquired at a dispersion of 0.051 / pixel and spectral resolution of @xmath310.5 , allowing 6 blended components of the @xmath01479 multiplets to be resolved .",
    "the detected features correspond to both the electric dipole allowed and forbidden transitions shown in the grotrian diagram in figure 2 .",
    "atomic data for the transitions are given in table 2 .",
    "the blended allowed transition wavelengths are 1474.1 , 1483.1 , and 1487.2 , while the blended forbidden transitions are at 1473.0 , 1481.7 , and 1485.6 .",
    "these data were reduced in the following manner . the rectified ( x2d )",
    "images were boxcar smoothed over a 3@xmath323 pixel region and background subtracted .",
    "the wavelength dependent background level was determined by averaging the signal in a region spatially one io diameter away from and comparable in size to the bright spectral features .",
    "next , several rectangular sub - images , centered on the brightest emission areas of the anti- and sub - jovian equatorial features , were created in order to isolate these spots and to ensure no overlap of emission .",
    "lastly , the data in the sub - images were compressed spatially into a one - dimensional array of flux vs. wavelength . because the spots are not located at the center of the aperture ,",
    "their flux spectra have systematic wavelength offsets , which we have corrected for .",
    "a gaussian profile was fitted to each of the 6 resolved emission features to determine their relative strengths .",
    "these gaussians are overplotted on the data in figure 3 .",
    "we re - analyze a set of iue observations of io which span the spectral range 1150 - 1950  @xcite .",
    "low resolution @xmath295   exposures of 13 - 14 hours in length were made over a three year period with the short - wavelength ( swp ) camera .",
    "we present a representative spectrum in figure 4a which is centered on io s western elongation on 1987 july 31 ; it was reduced following the same method as ballester and smoothed using a 5-element boxcar routine .",
    "an additional step was taken to remove the reflected light continuum longward of 1700  by subtracting a solar spectrum scaled to the intensity of the underlying continuum .",
    "the last set of io observations we re - analyze was made with the fos .",
    "these observations cover 1600 - 2300  and were obtained over a period of four years using the g190h grating , which has a dispersion of 1.45 / diode .",
    "exposures varied in length between 10 and 20 minutes .",
    "the representative spectrum shown in figure 4b was acquired while io was emerging into sunlight from jupiter s shadow on 1996 october 2 . in order to minimize scattered light contamination ,",
    "only the first 7 groups of the data , corresponding to io in eclipse , were used .",
    "the data were reduced in the same manner as presented in @xcite and were rebinned by 2 pixels and smoothed by 3 .",
    "several factors were considered in the analysis , including the influence of the emission morphology on the results , and possible contamination from so@xmath7 absorption . the emission morphology ( e.g. , one or two spots visible ) depends on io s orbital geometry @xcite , which may affect the absolute magnitude of the measured fluxes . when io is at western elongation , as it is for part of the iue and all of the stis integration time , both equatorial spots are in view for at least part of the exposure . for the fos egress data , when io is in shadow emerging from behind jupiter",
    ", only one equatorial spot would be visible if resolved .",
    "we assume that the opacity and the @xmath01479 analysis we present are independent of the emission morphology .",
    "concerning contamination due to so@xmath7 absorption , since the so@xmath7 is more concentrated at lower altitude than the atomic sulfur in the atmosphere , the absorption should be minimal .",
    "also , at the relevant wavelengths , the average so@xmath7 transmission is close to unity .",
    "therefore , the relative line strengths of the sulfur multiplets should not be significantly affected .",
    "it is desirable to separate the allowed from the forbidden transitions since the transition probabilities and the oscillator strengths for the two transitions are very different .",
    "the forbidden transitions are much more likely to be optically thin than the allowed ones , meaning two regimes of opacity can potentially be sampled . a quantitative determination of the relative contributions of the allowed and forbidden transitions",
    "can also be used to help analyze numerous data sets for which the multiplets are unresolved .",
    "a synthetic sulfur emission spectrum is created for the stis data set by adding together 13 gaussians of the same fwhm , one at each of the central wavelengths of the components of the @xmath01479 multiplet .",
    "each gaussian is weighted by its optically thin relative strength as reported in @xcite and then the entire synthetic spectrum is scaled to the intensity level of the data .",
    "a fit of the synthetic spectrum to the data is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the flux from each line is determined by integrating the area under the gaussian curves in figure 3 and is reported in table 3 .",
    "the allowed transitions contribute an average of 62 @xmath1 8% and the forbidden transitions an average of 38 @xmath1 8% to the total signal of the @xmath01479 emission .",
    "although the anti- and sub - jovian equatorial spots differ in flux by up to a factor of 2 , the relative line ratios and the contribution of the allowed and forbidden components are consistent throughout the data set .",
    "a synthetic sulfur emission spectrum is also created for the iue and fos data sets .",
    "a unique fwhm is chosen for each data set to match the resolution of the instrument .",
    "again , gaussians are placed at the central wavelengths for all lines of a given sulfur multiplet , weighted by its optically thin relative strength @xcite , and scaled to the data .",
    "if the data match the synthetic spectrum , sulfur is considered optically thin in that emission ; otherwise , it is considered optically thick .    the fits for @xmath01814 and ]",
    "@xmath01900 are overplotted on the data in figure 4 .",
    "if optically thin , the transitions of the @xmath01814 multiplet should be in a 5.2:3:1 ratio and the ] @xmath01900 doublet will be in a 3.6:1 ratio .",
    "the ratios are calculated from their transition probabilities listed in table 2 .",
    "we observe a ratio of 3.4:5.6:1 and 4.5:5:1 for the 1814 multiplet using the iue and fos data respectively , and 3:1 and 3.4:1 in the 1900 doublet .",
    "our results therefore indicate that the ] @xmath01900 doublet is optically thin and the @xmath01814 multiplet is optically thick .",
    "moreover , we have analyzed all the iue and fos data listed in table 1 and find that in all existing observations of io , the 1900  doublet is observed to be optically thin and the 1814  multiplet is observed to be optically thick .",
    "the allowed transitions of the @xmath01479 multiplet have a theoretical ratio of 5.2:3.1:1 when optically thin @xcite .",
    "we observe a ratio of 5.3:3.8:1 in the stis data for the @xmath01479 allowed multiplet .",
    "initially , our line ratios seemed to indicate that the @xmath01479 allowed multiplet is optically thin since the blended line ratios are consistent with the optically thin values ; however , this contradicts the fact that the @xmath01814 multiplet , which has the same ground state and similar oscillator strength as @xmath01479 , is consistently optically thick in all existing observations of io .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the @xmath01479 allowed transitions shows that because the lines are blends at stis resolution , optical depth effects can be hidden by the blending .",
    "the shorter wavelength transitions of a given blend , for example 1473.99  , 1474.38  , and 1483.04  , are preferentially depleted at high optical depth .",
    "the flux in these transitions is redistributed in the multiplet such that the fluxes in the longer wavelength transitions of the blend , 1474.57  and 1483.23  , are enhanced , and the 5:3:1 ratio of the blends is unaffected by this flux redistribution .",
    "the optical depth of a transition is directly proportional to both the column density and the absorption cross section , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 = 1 serving as the conventional boundary between the optically thin and thick regimes .",
    "therefore , generally speaking , an upper limit can be placed on the sulfur column density in the optically thin regime , and a lower limit in the optically thick regime . if @xmath35 is known , the sulfur column density can be constrained without assuming a specific @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the absorption cross section of photons in the core of an optically thin transition where only thermal doppler broadening and radiative damping are considered is directly proportional to the oscillator strength , @xmath36 , of the transition @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath34 = 1 , @xmath37 several consistent values of the oscillator strength are published for the dipole allowed transitions @xmath01814 and @xmath01479",
    ". only one value of the oscillator strength exists for the majority of the forbidden transitions of ] @xmath01479 . for the ] @xmath01900 transition , only two values of",
    "the oscillator strengths and transition probabilities exist ( mller 1968 ; tayal 1998see the discussion in @xcite on the order of magnitude disagreement between these values ) . the values and references for the transition probabilities and oscillator strengths",
    "we use are given in table 2 .",
    "using equation ( 1 ) with @xmath38 = 1000k and the oscillator strength of @xmath36 = 0.090 @xcite for the @xmath01479 allowed multiplet , the lower bound for the sulfur column density is 3.6@xmath210@xmath3@xmath6 .",
    "a similar lower bound of 2.8@xmath210@xmath3@xmath6 is found using the @xmath36 value of 0.093 @xcite for the @xmath01814 multiplet .",
    "an upper bound of 1.7@xmath210@xmath5@xmath6 is found using the oscillator strength of the dominant ] @xmath01479 forbidden transition line , 1472.97  , listed in @xcite as @xmath36 = 0.019 .",
    "this result is lower than the previous upper bound for the atomic sulfur column density at io , 7@xmath210@xmath9@xmath6 , by more than 2 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "an explanation of this discrepancy is given in the discussion .",
    "knowledge about the sulfur column density in turn allows us to place constraints on the electron temperature and density of the impacting plasma .",
    "the observed line of sight brightness is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath13 are the sulfur and electron densities , respectively , and @xmath41 is the temperature dependent electron excitation rate coefficient .",
    "although it has been shown by @xcite and @xcite that the plasma flow and interaction around io creates varying electron density and temperature profiles at io , we assume that @xmath13 and @xmath12 are constant along the line of sight , invert equation ( 2 ) , and arrive at an approximate relationship between the sulfur column density and the measured emission line brightness , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is in units of rayleighs , @xmath44 is in units of @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is in units of cm@xmath20 s@xmath48 . for a particular transition from an upper state @xmath49 to a lower state @xmath50 ,",
    "the rate coefficient is @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the thermally averaged collision strength , @xmath53 is the statistical weight of the lower state , @xmath54 is the transition energy in units of ev , @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath12 is the electron temperature in units of kelvin .",
    "these equations apply only to optically thin transitions , therefore , the ] @xmath01479 forbidden multiplet or the ] @xmath01900 intercombination doublet must be used in determining the electron temperature and density . as there are",
    "no electron impact excitation cross - sections or collision strengths available for the ] @xmath01479 forbidden multiplet , the ] @xmath01900 intercombination doublet is used for the analysis .",
    "we use the electron excitation rate presented in figure 9a of @xcite .    combining the sulfur column density bounds from the @xmath01479 analysis , the line brightnesses of the ] @xmath01900 intercombination doublet from the iue data when io was west of jupiter , and equation ( 3 ) , the density and temperature of the impacting electrons can be estimated .",
    "for an electron temperature range of 0.8 - 100 ev and several impacting electron density values between 500 and 10000 @xmath45 , the column density is plotted in figure 5 .",
    "both a low temperature solution , 1.5 ev @xmath56 7 ev , and a high temperature solution , 7 ev @xmath56 100 ev , are possible .",
    "the canonical values of 5 ev and 2000 @xmath45 are consistent with the low temperature solution . assuming the low temperature solution implies 1000 @xmath575000 @xmath45 .",
    "the stis observations presented here and used to calculate the atomic sulfur column density are tangential cuts through io s atmosphere centered on the equatorial spots ; therefore , the column densities are also tangential .",
    "@xcite has recently published a collection of four years of hst / stis low resolution observations of near io emissions and extended emissions in the 1150 - 1730  wavelength range .",
    "the photon fluxes measured at 1 io radius for the @xmath01479 multiplets varied between 3@xmath210@xmath58@xmath6sec@xmath48 and 3@xmath210@xmath59@xmath6sec@xmath48 , corresponding to eclipse and western elongation , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with our hst / stis photon fluxes for @xmath01479 , implying that the tangential sulfur column that @xcite were sampling should have values for @xmath10 similar to ours .",
    "@xcite determined the vertical column density of s , so , and so@xmath7 above specific locations on io , including the pele volcano . with an estimated collision strength and electron impact excitation rate coefficient for the ] @xmath01900 doublet , and assuming canonical plasma torus values of electron density and temperature , 1000 @xmath45 and 5 ev",
    ", they determine an @xmath10 of 1@xmath210@xmath60@xmath6 at pele , which is much larger than our upper bound of 1.3@xmath210@xmath5@xmath6 . a column density that is significantly larger than our value should result in additional optical depth effects . in figure 6 , the pele flux spectrum published in figure 2 of @xcite is compared with the optically thin fos synthetic spectrum described earlier , and confirms that the @xmath01814 multiplet is more optically thick over pele than in our iue and fos spectra , lending credence to the significantly higher value of @xmath10 over pele despite the uncertainty in the ] @xmath01900 electron excitation rate .",
    "this implies that @xmath10 is larger in volcanic plumes than in the equatorial spots .    in the 1-d",
    ", steady state photochemical atmospheric models presented by @xcite , both high and low density so@xmath7 atmosphere sub - solar profiles with various levels of vertical eddy mixing are calculated .",
    "we have extracted the vertical column densities of several atmospheric components from their published profiles .",
    "the @xmath10 values corresponding to the high density so@xmath7 cases , @xmath16 = 10@xmath61@xmath6 , were much higher than the limits from our analysis .",
    "for example , with a low vertical eddy mixing coefficient of @xmath55 = 10@xmath62cm@xmath19sec@xmath48 , @xmath10 @xmath29 2@xmath210@xmath64@xmath6 ; for a high vertical eddy mixing coefficient of @xmath55 = 10@xmath65cm@xmath19sec@xmath48 , @xmath669@xmath210@xmath67@xmath6 . on the other hand , for their low density case ( @xmath16 = 8@xmath210@xmath68@xmath6 with high eddy mixing @xmath55 = 10@xmath65cm@xmath19sec@xmath48 ) @xmath10 @xmath29 6@xmath210@xmath69@xmath6 . the corresponding tangential column density , assuming spherical symmetry and using the atmospheric sulfur number density profile in @xcite , is on the order of 4@xmath210@xmath70@xmath6 .",
    "this value is much more consistent with our results and the general overall picture of the so@xmath7 atmosphere described in the introduction . in a 3-d high density so@xmath7 model atmosphere presented by @xcite , they assume an initial sub - solar @xmath16 of 6@xmath3210@xmath64@xmath6 , which results in a tangential sulfur column density at the terminator , @xmath712@xmath210@xmath68@xmath6 , inconsistent with our upper limit to @xmath10 . in the model in which the input so@xmath7 column is reduced to a lower density value of 7@xmath3210@xmath72@xmath6 ,",
    "the tangential @xmath10 is more consistent with our results at a value of 6@xmath3210@xmath70@xmath6 .    in order to predict what the atmospheric driving mechanism is ,",
    "@xcite have modeled both an so@xmath7 frost sublimation atmosphere and a pele - type volcanically driven atmosphere .",
    "of the two models , our @xmath10 value is more consistent with the so@xmath7 frost sublimation atmosphere simply because this model has a lower sulfur column density .",
    "however , the true test to the moses et al .",
    "( 2001 ) models is to compare the sulfur to oxygen column abundances extracted from a single exposure . when the sulfur is more abundant than the oxygen , the models imply a volcanically driven atmosphere .",
    "none of the medium resolution data presented here had a simultaneous oxygen detection , so the ratio is not currently available , although this sulfur to oxygen relationship will be analyzed in future work with a more extensive data set .",
    "the authors would like to thank darrell strobel and warren moos for insightful discussions on the atomic physics of the uv sulfur transitions .",
