    "collective dynamics of many - body systems has attracted much attention in the fields of statistical physics and its neighboring disciplines . as for the examples ,",
    "one finds the collective motions of particles  @xcite , vehicles  @xcite , pedestrians  @xcite , and animals  @xcite .",
    "this subject has been studied by modeling a set of individual behavioral rules in order to quantify emergent collective patterns from interactions among individuals .",
    "based on this approach , various interesting collective behaviors have been identified such as concurrent state in highway traffic  @xcite and lane formation in pedestrian flow  @xcite .",
    "these collective behaviors are interesting not only because they arise without any external controls but also because they improve efficiency of traffic flow .",
    "however , for the density of particles above a certain level , the interactions among individuals may cause jamming transitions that reduce the traffic flow efficiency  @xcite .",
    "jamming transitions have generated considerable research interest , not only because of their relevance to collective dynamics including clogging effect in granular flow  @xcite and faster - is - slower effect in pedestrian evacuations  @xcite , but also for practical applications such as monitoring congestions on freeways  @xcite and developing adaptive cruise control strategies  @xcite .",
    "jamming transitions in pedestrian flow have been investigated for various situations .",
    "based on lattice gas model , muramatsu  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied jamming transitions as a function of pedestrian density in bidirectional flow , and observed freezing transition for high pedestrian density in a straight corridor .",
    "later , tajima  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite identified a jamming transition from free flow to saturated flow at a critical density . above the critical density",
    ", pedestrian flow rate stays constant against increasing density , defining saturated flow rate .",
    "they also presented scaling behavior of the saturated flow rate and critical density depending on the width of bottleneck and corridor . for an evacuation scenario , helbing  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed that an arch - like blocking appears in front of an exit which significantly increases evacuation time . in another study , they reported that a noise term in the equation of pedestrian motion can reproduce a freezing phenomenon , in which pedestrian flow reached a complete stop  @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount of literature has reported jamming transitions in the flow of pedestrians walking from one point to another .",
    "in addition , previous studies provided narrative descriptions of the case interacting with attractions such as shop displays and public events . for instance , goffman  @xcite described that window shoppers act like obstructions to passersby on streets when they stop to check store displays .",
    "those shoppers can further interfere with other pedestrians when the shoppers enter and leave the stores . in another study , gipps and marksj",
    "@xcite stated that an attraction in a pedestrian facility can attract nearby pedestrians , and such an attraction may impede pedestrian traffic especially during peak periods .",
    "although it has been well recognized that an attraction can trigger pedestrian jams , to our best knowledge , little attention has been paid to characterize the dynamics of their jamming transitions . in pedestrian facilities",
    ", pedestrians can see the attractions and might shift their attention towards the attractions .",
    "if the attractions are tempting enough , a fair number of pedestrians gather around the attractions , forming attendee clusters . in our previous studies",
    "@xcite , we characterized collective patterns of attendee clusters , and investigated how such various patterns can emerge from attractive interactions between pedestrians and attractions .",
    "nevertheless , little is known about how an attendee cluster can contribute to jamming transitions in pedestrian flow .",
    "it is apparent that if a large attendee cluster exists near an attraction , passersby are forced to walk through the reduced available space .",
    "consequently , the attendee cluster is acting as a pedestrian bottleneck for passersby .",
    "the flow through the bottleneck can show transitions from free flow to jamming states and may end in gridlock .",
    "the jamming transitions near an attraction will be the subject of this paper . in the following ,",
    "we investigate jamming patterns induced by the attraction and understand the transitions at a microscopic level .    by means of numerical simulations",
    ", we characterize jamming transitions in pedestrian flow interacting with an attraction . the simulation model and its setup",
    "are explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "then we analyze the spatio - temporal patterns of jamming transitions induced by an attraction and summarize the results with phase diagrams , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "in addition , we provide microscopic understanding of the jamming transitions by mainly looking into conflicts among pedestrians . finally , we discuss the findings of this study in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "following the work of helbing  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we describe the motion of pedestrian @xmath0 with the following equation : @xmath1 the first term on the right hand side is the driving force term indicating that pedestrian @xmath0 adjusts his walking velocity @xmath2 in order to achieve his desired walking speed @xmath3 along with the desired walking direction vector @xmath4 . here , @xmath4 is a unit vector pointing to the direction in which pedestrian @xmath0 wants to move .",
    "we assume passersby aim at smoothly bypassing obstacles while walking towards their destination ; see appendix  [ sec : steering ] for more details .",
    "note that passersby in this study are the pedestrians who are not interested in the attraction , thus they do not visit the attraction .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath5 controls how quickly he adapts his velocity to the desired velocity .",
    "the repulsive force terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 reflect his collision avoidance behavior against other pedestrian @xmath8 and the boundary @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "previous studies have reported that preventing overlaps among pedestrians is important to provide better representation of pedestrian stopping behavior , which often triggers jams .",
    "parisi  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the respect area , which reserves a space in the order of pedestrian radius , in order to suppress overlapping among pedestrians .",
    "later , chraibi  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a new interpersonal repulsion model which can prevent overlapping in one dimensional pedestrian flow . in their models ,",
    "the driving force term becomes inactive when a pedestrian does not have enough room for stride .",
    "inspired by those studies , we postulate that the desired speed @xmath3 is an attainable speed of pedestrian @xmath0 depending on the available walking space in front of him , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a comfortable walking speed and @xmath12 is the distance between pedestrian @xmath0 and the first pedestrian @xmath8 encountering with pedestrian @xmath0 in the course of @xmath13 .",
    "time - to - collision @xmath14 represents how much time remains for a collision of two pedestrians @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "further details of @xmath14 are given in appendix  [ sec : t_c ] .",
    "the collision avoidance behavior is modeled with @xmath6 and @xmath7 . according to previous studies  @xcite , the interpersonal repulsion @xmath6 between pedestrians @xmath0 and @xmath8",
    "is specified by repulsive potential with respect to @xmath15 : @xmath16 \\omega_{ij}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are strength and range of the interpersonal repulsion , and @xmath19 is the effective distance between pedestrians @xmath0 and @xmath8 by assuming their relative displacement @xmath20 with the stride time @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic function @xmath22 represents the directional sensitivity to pedestrian @xmath8 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the minimum anisotropic strength for pedestrian @xmath8 who is behind pedestrian @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the angle @xmath25 is measured between velocity vector of the pedestrian @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and relative location of pedestrian @xmath8 with respect to pedestrian @xmath0 , @xmath26 .",
    "the boundary repulsion is given as @xmath27\\vec{e}_{ib}$ ] , where @xmath28 is the perpendicular distance between pedestrian @xmath0 and wall @xmath9 , and @xmath29 is the unit vector pointing from the wall @xmath9 to the pedestrian @xmath0 .",
    "the strength and the range of repulsive interaction from boundaries are denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "it has been widely believed that individual choice behavior can be influenced by the choice of other individuals .",
    "for instance , previous studies on stimulus crowd effects reported that a pedestrian is more likely to shift his attention towards the crowd as its size grows  @xcite .",
    "this belief is also generally accepted in the marketing area , which can be interpreted that having more visitors in a store can attract more pedestrians to the store  @xcite .",
    "it is also suggested that the sensitivity to others choice is different for different places , time - of - day , and visitors motivation  @xcite .",
    "based on those studies  @xcite , we assume that an individual decides whether he is going to visit an attraction based on the number of pedestrians attending the attraction .",
    "the sensitivity to others choice can be represented as social influence parameter @xmath32 . as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite , we formulate the probability of joining an attraction @xmath33 by the analogy with sigmoidal choice rule  @xcite , @xmath34 here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the number of pedestrians who have already joined and that of the pedestrians not stopping by the attraction , respectively . in order to prevent indeterminate case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_a ] ) , we set @xmath37 and @xmath38 as baseline values for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the social influence parameter @xmath41 can be also understood as pedestrians awareness of the attraction . according to previous studies  @xcite",
    ", we assume that the strength of social influence can be different for different situations and can be controlled in the presented model .",
    "once an individual has joined an attraction , he will then stay near the attraction for an exponentially distributed time with an average of @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "after the duration of visit , he leaves the attraction and continues walking towards his initial destination , not visiting the attraction again .",
    "each pedestrian is modeled by a circle with radius @xmath43  m. pedestrians move in a corridor of length @xmath44  m and width @xmath45  m in the horizontal direction .",
    "an attraction is placed at the center of the lower wall .",
    "pedestrians move with comfortable walking speed @xmath46  m / s and with relaxation time @xmath47  s , and their speed can not exceed @xmath48  m / s .",
    "the parameters of the repulsive force terms are given based on previous works : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "the minimum anisotropic strength @xmath54 is set to 0.25 for attendees near the attraction and 0.5 for others , yielding that the attendees exerts smaller repulsive force to others than passersby do .",
    "consequently , the attendees can stay closer to the attraction while being less disturbed by the passersby .    the joining probability in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_a ] ) is updated with the social force model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) for each simulation time step of @xmath55  s. an individual evaluates the joining probability when he can perceive the attraction @xmath56  m ahead .",
    "if the individual decides to join the attraction , then he changes his desired direction vector @xmath57 from @xmath58 into @xmath59 . here ,",

    "@xmath38 are set to be @xmath60 , meaning that both options are equally attractive when the individual would see nobody within @xmath56  m from the center of the attraction .",
    "an individual @xmath0 is counted as an attending pedestrian if his efficiency of motion @xmath61 is lower than @xmath55 within a range of @xmath60  m from the boundary of the attendee cluster .",
    "the individual efficiency of motion @xmath62 indicates how much the driving force contributes to the pedestrian @xmath0 s motion with a range from @xmath63 to @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "we assumed that @xmath64 is tolerant enough to distinguish a weak motion of attendees near an attraction from actively walking pedestrians not visiting the attraction .",
    "the average duration of visiting an attraction @xmath65 is set to be @xmath66  s.    the number of pedestrians in the corridor is associated with the pedestrian influx @xmath67 , i.e. , the arrival rate of pedestrians entering the corridor .",
    "the unit of @xmath67 is indicated by p / s , which stands for pedestrians per second .",
    "based on previous studies  @xcite , the pedestrian arrival rate is assumed to follow a shifted exponential distribution , indicating that pedestrians are entering the corridor independently and their arrival pattern is not influenced by those of others .",
    "the minimum headway is set to @xmath68  s between successive pedestrians entering the corridor , which is large enough to prevent overlaps between arrival pedestrians .    for our numerical simulations ,",
    "a straight corridor will be considered to study pedestrian jams induced by an attraction . in the straight corridor ,",
    "one can consider two possible patterns of flow , i.e. , bidirectional and unidirectional flows .",
    "in the bidirectional flow , one half of the population is walking towards the right boundary of the corridor from the left , and the opposite direction for the other half . in the unidirectional flow , all pedestrians are entering the corridor through the left boundary and walking towards the right .",

    "hollow red circles depict pedestrians attracted by the attraction . in bidirectional flow",
    ", we can observe ( a ) free flow phase in case of @xmath69  p / s and @xmath70 , in which passersby can walk towards their destinations without being interrupted by the cluster of attracted pedestrians , and ( b ) freezing phase in case of @xmath69  p / s and @xmath71 , where oppositely walking pedestrians stopped because they block each other .",
    "note that p / s stands for pedestrians per second , being the unit of pedestrian flux @xmath67 . ]",
    "our simulation results show different patterns of pedestrian motions depending on influx @xmath67 and social influence parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the free flow phase appears when both @xmath67 and @xmath32 are small . from fig .",

    "simultaneously , the attracted pedestrians form a stable cluster near the attraction .",
    "if both @xmath67 and @xmath32 are large , we can see freezing phase , in which oppositely walking pedestrians reach a complete stop because they block each other , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot_bi](b ) .    to quantify spatio - temporal patterns of pedestrian flow , we measure the local efficiency @xmath72 for a given time @xmath73 and segment @xmath74 in horizontal direction : @xmath75 here",

    "thus , @xmath78 indicates that passersby can freely walk without reducing his speed , while @xmath79 implies that passersby have reached a standstill .",
    "the individual efficiency of motion @xmath80 can be understood as a normalized speed in horizontal direction .",
    "the local efficiency @xmath72 indicates how fast the passersby in segment @xmath74 progress towards their destination at time @xmath73 .     and location @xmath74 , @xmath72 , for different pedestrian flow patterns in bidirectional flow .",

    "it is reasonable to suppose that the impact of increasing @xmath83 becomes less notable for large @xmath83 , in that increased @xmath83 allows conflicting pedestrians to have more space for resolving the conflicts but also the attendee cluster to grow larger .",
