    "the modelling of current - to - voltage measurements is a fundamental part of _ electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) _ in which the aim is to reconstruct information about the conductivity distribution inside a body by external measurements of electric current and voltage @xcite . in practice , through a set of surface electrodes , currents of prescribed magnitudes are conducted into the object and the voltages needed for maintaining the currents are recorded .",
    "the most accurate mathematical model for a practical current - to - voltage measurement is the _ complete electrode model _ ( cem ) which takes into account both the shapes and shunting effect of the electrodes by modelling the electrodes as medium - sized perfect conductors .",
    "moreover , the quality of electrode contacts is described in the cem by contact impedance parameters which model the effect of the resistive layers present at the electrode / object interfaces .",
    "it has been experimentally verified that the cem is capable of predicting experimental data to better than @xmath0 @xcite .    in _ absolute _ eit , where conductivity images are computed from fixed - frequency current - to - voltage data measured on an unchanging object ,",
    "a major challenge is that the measurement is significantly affected by unknown contact impedances .",
    "the problem can be tackled e.g.  by applying cem - based iterative ( newton - type ) methods which allow estimating both the conductivity distribution and the contact impedances @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "a subtlety arises if a physical contact impedance is very close to zero , as numerical approximation of the cem is known to turn unstable in the limit @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that most numerical instabilities can be avoided by forcing the contact impedance parameters far enough from zero during the iterations @xcite .",
    "another tempting approach is to replace the cem by the so - called _ shunt model _",
    "( sm ) which formally corresponds to the cem with zero contact impedances . to rigorously justify",
    "either of the stabilization procedures , it is necessary to demonstrate that the cem converges controllably to the sm as the contact impedance tends to zero . proving and analyzing the convergence is the main research problem of this work .    to put our work into perspective",
    ", we note that the relationship between the cem and other widely used idealistic models for eit measurements  the _ continuum model _ ( cm ) and the _ point electrode podel _ ( pem )  has already been studied @xcite .",
    "the cm assumes infinite dimensional boundary data and has been used to prove the theoretical stability and uniqueness results on the inverse conductivity problem of eit .",
    "the approximation of cm boundary data in terms of the cem as the number of electrodes increase was considered in @xcite . in the pem",
    ", the electrodes are modelled as point sources and the model has some attractive properties ( such as conformal invariance and closed form solutions @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to its inbuilt singularity , the pem is applicable only in modelling the difference of two electrode measurements .",
    "the interpretation of the pem as a limiting case of the cem as the electrodes get small was analyzed in @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "the work in this paper can be seen as complementing the above results from the point of view of the sm .",
    "let us briefly outline the mathematics in this work . in a given object",
    "@xmath1 with conductivity distribution @xmath2 , applying a static electric field in @xmath3 induces a potential determined via the conductivity equation @xmath4 the effect of contact impedance ( resistance ) is modelled in the cem by a positive @xmath5 in a robin - type boundary condition @xmath6 on each electrode , with @xmath7 representing the voltage perceived by the electrode .",
    "as current injection is exclusively confined to the electrodes , one ends up with a mixed zero - neumann / robin ( nr ) boundary value problem for . for fixed boundary data @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the asymptotics of the solution @xmath10 as @xmath5 tends to zero has been previously studied in @xcite ; in particular , the limit coincides with the solution of the mixed zero - neumann / dirichlet ( nd ) problem .",
    "unfortunately , the existing theory does not directly imply asymptotics for the solution of the cem problem because the electrode voltages are not fixed  they depend on @xmath5 .",
    "identifying the sm with a subspace projection of the cem allows us to prove convergence in an abstract functional analytical framework .",
    "it is noteworthy that the obtained convergence result not only holds for the cem and sm , but also for their discrete galerkin approximations .    to obtain an explicit convergence rate , we resort to the existing regularity theory for elliptic mixed boundary value problems @xcite . in general , the solutions of nr and nd problems belong at best to @xmath11 for any @xmath12 ( nr ) and @xmath13 ( nd ) , respectively .",
    "we show that given this sobolev regularity , the @xmath14-error between the cem and sm solutons is of order @xmath15 with an arbitrary @xmath16 is shown to be optimal for a generic two dimensional problem for laplacian with fixed boundary data . ] .",
    "interestingly , the subspace projection property of the sm yields a better  of order @xmath17 for any @xmath12  rate for the electrode voltage .",
    "in other words , if the cem is replaced by the sm , the error in the practical electrode measurement data exhibits almost linear dependence on the contact impedance . finally , as a side - product",
    ", we point out that the same argument is also applicable to the finite element ( fe ) approximation of the cem by piecewise linear polynomials : we show that the electrode potential @xmath8 is `` @xmath18 two times '' more accurately approximated than the spatial potential @xmath10 .",
    "the theoretical results are complemented with two numerical experiments in the plane . in the first one , we probe the convergence with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "the anticipated convergence rates are detected with a reasonable success .",
    "in particular , the differing rates for @xmath10 and @xmath8 are observed . in the second numerical experiment ,",
    "the convergence rates ( with respect to the mesh parameter @xmath19 ) of the fe approximations of the cem and sm are tracked .",
    "the results indicate that the corresponding rates are indeed different for @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the dissolution of the regularity of @xmath10 as @xmath5 tends to zero is shown to cause a slowing @xmath19-fe convergence rate for the cem  an analogous phenomenon is well - known in numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "the regularizing effect of the contact impedance has practical significance as one usually aims for good electrode contacts whereas many reconstruction algorithms rely on repetitive accurate applications of fe - based solvers @xcite .",
