    "the problem of vacuum tunneling in de sitter spacetime has recently acquired renewed relevance . in part , this is due to developments in string theory , which suggest that vacuum tunneling may be of relevance for understanding transitions between the various potential vacua that populate the string theory landscape .",
    "but , it is also of interest for the light that it can shed on the nature of de sitter spacetime . in this talk",
    "i will describe some recent work  @xcite with jim hackworth in which we explored some aspects of the subject that have received relatively little attention .",
    "de sitter spacetime is the solution to einstein s equations when there is a constant positive vacuum energy density @xmath0 , but no other source .",
    "globally , it can be represented as the hyperboloid @xmath1 in a flat five - dimensional space with metric @xmath2 , where @xmath3 the surfaces of constant @xmath4 are three - spheres , with the sphere of minimum radius , @xmath5 , occurring at @xmath6 . however , the special role played by this surface is illusory .",
    "de sitter spacetime is homogeneous , and a spacelike three - sphere of minimum radius can be drawn through any point .",
    "an important property of de sitter spacetime is the existence of horizons . just as for the case of a black hole ,",
    "the existence of a horizon gives rise to thermal radiation , characterized by a temperature @xmath7 however , there are important differences from the black hole case .",
    "a black hole horizon has a definite location , independent of the observer .",
    "further , although an observer s motion affects how the thermal radiation is perceived , the radiation has an unambiguous , observer - independent consequence  after a finite time , the black hole evaporates .",
    "by contrast , the location of the de sitter horizon varies from observer to observer .",
    "although comoving observers detect thermal radiation with a temperature @xmath8 , this radiation does not in any sense cause the de sitter spacetime to evaporate .",
    "as we will see , tunneling between different de sitter vacua provides further insight into the thermal nature of de sitter spacetime and the meaning of @xmath8 .",
    "of course , the relevance of de sitter spacetime to our universe comes from the fact that in the far past , during the inflationary era , and in the far future , if the dark energy truly corresponds to a cosmological constant , the universe approximates a portion of de sitter spacetime .",
    "the underlying assumption is that results derived in the context of the full de sitter spacetime are applicable to a region that is approximately de sitter over a spacetime volume large compared to @xmath9 .",
    "the prototypical example for studying vacuum decay is a scalar field theory with a potential , such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ potentialfig ] , that has both an absolute minimum ( the `` true vacuum '' ) and a higher local minimum ( the `` false vacuum '' ) . for the purposes of this talk",
    "i will assume that @xmath10 , so that both vacua correspond to de sitter spacetimes .",
    "the false vacuum is a metastable state that decays by quantum mechanical tunneling .",
    "it must be kept in mind , however , that the tunneling is not from a homogeneous false vacuum to a homogeneous true vacuum , as might be suggested by the plot of @xmath11 .",
    "rather , the decay proceeds via bubble nucleation , with tunneling being from the homogeneous false vacuum to a configuration containing a bubble of ( approximate ) true vacuum embedded in a false vacuum background .",
    "after nucleation , the bubble expands , a classically allowed process .",
    "i will begin the discussion of this process by recalling the simplest case of quantum tunneling , that of a point particle of mass @xmath12 tunneling through a one - dimensional potential energy barrier @xmath13 from a initial point @xmath14 to a point @xmath15 on the other side of the barrier .",

    "given an initial point @xmath19 , one considers paths @xmath20 that start at @xmath19 and end at some point @xmath21 on the opposite side of the barrier .",
    "each such path defines a one - dimensional tunneling integral @xmath22 .",
    "the wkb tunneling exponent is obtained from the path that minimizes this integral  @xcite as a bonus , this minimization process also determines the optimal exit point from the barrier .    by manipulations analogous to those used in classical mechanics ( but with some signs changed ) , this minimization problem can be recast as the problem of finding a stationary point of the euclidean action @xmath23\\ , .\\ ] ] one is thus led to solve the euclidean equations of motion @xmath24 the boundary conditions are that @xmath25 and ( because the kinetic energy vanishes at the point where the particle emerges from the barrier ) that @xmath26 at @xmath27 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath28 at the endpoint implies that the solution can be extended back , in a `` @xmath29-reversed '' fashion , to give a solution that runs from @xmath19 to @xmath21 and back again to @xmath19 .",

    "it is essential to remember that @xmath29 is not in any sense a time , but merely one of many possible parameterizations of the optimal tunneling path .",
    "the translation of this to field theory  @xcite is straightforward : the coordinates @xmath31 become the field variables @xmath32 , and the path @xmath33 becomes a series of three - dimensional field configurations @xmath34 .",

    "this configuration , @xmath43 , gives the initial condition for the subsequent real - time evolution of the bubble .",
    "as with the single - particle case , a @xmath29-reflected solution is conventionally added to give a full bounce .    despite the fact that the spatial coordinates @xmath40 and the path parameter @xmath29 have very different physical meanings , there is a remarkable mathematical symmetry in how they enter .",
    "this suggests looking for solutions that have an so(4 ) symmetry ; i.e. , solutions for which @xmath44 is a function of only @xmath45 .",
    "for such solutions , the field equation reduces to @xmath46 the boundary conditions are @xmath47 where the first follows from the requirement that the solution be nonsingular at the origin , and the second ensures both that a spatial slice at @xmath48 corresponds to the initial state , and that the slices at finite @xmath29 have finite energy relative to the initial state . note",
    "that while @xmath49 is required to be on the true vacuum side of the barrier , it is not equal to ( although it may be close to ) @xmath50 .",
    "although the tunneling exponent is readily obtained from the wkb approach , the prefactor , including ( in principle ) higher order corrections , is most easily calculated from a path integral approach  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to view the false vacuum as a metastable state with a complex energy , with the imaginary part of the energy density yielding the decay rate per unit volume .",

    "this path integral can be calculated by summing the contributions from the various stationary points , each of which gives a factor of @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 is the functional second derivative of the action , evaluated at the stationary point ; i.e. , the product of the frequencies of the normal modes .",
    "the first stationary point , a homogeneous false vacuum configuration with @xmath56 everywhere , gives a contribution @xmath57 , where the real prefactor @xmath58 includes the ( properly renormalized ) determinant factor and @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 denotes the volume of space and is understood to be taken to infinity at the end of the calculation .",
    "the next stationary point is the bounce solution to eq .",
    "( [ flatscalar ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the determinant factor here is complicated by the fact that @xmath61 has one negative and four zero eigenvalues .",
    "the former implies a factor of @xmath62 , which i will display explicitly .",
    "the latter require the introduction of collective coordinates ; integrating over these gives a factor of @xmath63 , corresponding to the fact that the bounce can be centered anywhere in the four - dimensional euclidean space .    finally , the approximate stationary points corresponding to multibounce solutions also contribute , with the @xmath64-bounce contribution including a factor of @xmath65 from integrating over the positions of @xmath64 identical bounces .",

    "there is little change from the zero - temperature nucleation rate .",
    "however , in the high - temperature regime where @xmath72 is much smaller than this characteristic radius the path integral is dominated by configurations that are constant in @xmath29 . a spatial slice at fixed @xmath29 gives a configuration , with total energy @xmath73 , that contains a single critical bubble .",
    "the exponent in the nucleation rate takes the thermal form @xmath74 note that , in contrast to the zero temperature case , there is no spatial slice corresponding to the initial state . only through the boundary conditions at spatial infinity",

    "their treatment did not include the calculation of the prefactor , an issue that remains poorly understood .",

    ". if @xmath126 is even , the two solutions are physically distinct , with one having @xmath44 on the true vacuum side of the barrier at both endpoints , and the other having both endpoint values on the false vacuum side .",

    "is increased further , the endpoints move down the sides of the barrier , until eventually the small amplitude approximation breaks down .",
    "nevertheless , we would expect the solutions to persist , with @xmath49 and @xmath105 each moving toward one of the vacua .",
    "when @xmath120 reaches the next critical value , @xmath136 , two new solutions , with @xmath137 oscillations about @xmath96 , will appear , but the previous ones will remain .",
    "thus , for @xmath138 , we should expect to find solutions with @xmath139 oscillations .",
    "we have confirmed these expectations by numerically integrating the bounce equations for various values of the parameters ; the solutions for a typical potential with @xmath140 are shown in fig",
    ".  [ array ] .",
    "the fact that the number of solutions should increase with @xmath120 is physically quite reasonable .",
    "one would expect the minimum distance needed for an oscillation about @xmath96 , like the thickness of the bubble wall itself , to be roughly @xmath141 .",
    "hence , the number of oscillations that can fit on a sphere of radius @xmath5 should be of order @xmath142 .",
    "in particular , this suggests that for @xmath143 there should not even be a @xmath144 coleman - de luccia bounce  @xcite .",
    "it is thus somewhat puzzling to note the implications of eq .",
    "( [ amplitude ] ) for the case where @xmath145 is negative . here ,",
    "increasing @xmath120 through a critical value causes two solutions to merge into the hawking - moss solution and disappear , suggesting that the number of solutions is a decreasing function of @xmath120 .",
    "the resolution to this can be found by analytically and numerically examining various potentials that are unusually flat at the top . in all the cases",
    "we have examined , the number of solutions is governed by a parameter @xmath146 that measures an averaged value of @xmath147 over the width of the potential barrier . when @xmath146 is sufficiently small , there are no bounce solutions ( other than the hawking - moss , which is always present ) . as @xmath146",
    "is increased , new solutions appear at critical values .",
    "these first appear as solutions with finite values of @xmath148 .",
    "they then bifurcate , with @xmath49 for one solution moving toward a vacuum and @xmath49 for the other moving toward @xmath149 , eventually reaching it and disappearing when @xmath120 is at a critical value .",
    "the net effect is that the number of solutions generally increases with @xmath146 , although it is not strictly monotonic .",
    "how should these oscillating bounce solutions be interpreted ? for the flat space bubble , a spacelike slice through the center of the bounce gives the initial conditions for the real - time evolution of the system after nucleation ; these predict a bubble wall with a well - defined trajectory and a speed that soon approaches the speed of light .",
    "the interpretation of the coleman - de luccia bounce is similar .",
    "the main new feature here is the fact that the spacelike slice is finite .",
    "formally , this corresponds to the fact that de sitter spacetime is a closed universe , even though we expect the bubble nucleation process to proceed similarly in a spacetime that only approximates de sitter locally .",
    "the hawking - moss solution can be interpreted as corresponding to a thermal fluctuation of all of de sitter space ( or , more plausibly , of an entire horizon volume ) to the top of the potential barrier . strictly speaking",
    ", classical lorentzian evolution would leave @xmath44 at the top of the barrier forever .",
    "however , this is an unstable configuration , and so would be expected to break up , in a stochastic fashion , into regions that evolve toward one vacuum or the other .",
    "the oscillating bounce solutions yield a hybrid of these two extremes .",
    "the endcap regions near @xmath83 and @xmath150 clearly evolve into vacuum regions analogous to those from the coleman - de luccia bounce , while the intermediate , `` oscillating '' , region is like that emerging from a hawking - moss mediated transition . as with the hawking - moss solution , the bounce carries no information about the initial state , and there is not even any correlation between the vacua in the endcaps and the initial vacuum state .",
    "thus , like hawking - moss , it is reminiscent of finite temperature tunneling in the absence of gravity , and provides evidence of the thermal nature of de sitter spacetime .",
    "the relative importance of the various solutions depends on the values of their euclidean actions .",
    "although the details vary with the particular form of the potential , the various regimes are characterized by a parameter @xmath146 measuring an averaged value of @xmath147 .",
    "if @xmath151 , there is a coleman - de luccia bounce , a hawking - moss solution , and many oscillating bounces .",
    "however , the coleman - de luccia bounce has a much smaller action than the others , and so dominates .",
    "this is a regime of quantum tunneling transitions followed by deterministic classical evolution . at",
    "the other extreme is the case where @xmath152 , where the hawking - moss is the only solution to the bounce equations .",
    "this is a regime of thermal transitions followed by stochastic real - time evolution . in between",
    "is a transitional region , with thermal effects still important .",
    "it is here that the oscillating bounces are most likely to play a role ."
