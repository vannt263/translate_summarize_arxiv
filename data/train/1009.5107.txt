    "there is overwhelming evidence that our universe contains a large component of non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "however , so far its identity and nature have remained elusive @xcite .",
    "understanding dark matter in a larger context remains one of the most compelling mysteries in particle astrophysics . with the advent of the current generation of gamma ray and neutrino observatories , the next generation of direct detection experiments , and the successful operation of the large hadron collider",
    ", we have entered a promising era for the detection of dark matter through non - gravitational interactions with the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the deep mysteries of dark matter is the fact that on the one hand it must be massive , but on the other , incredibly stable , with a lifetime on the order of the age of the universe itself .",
    "this odd combination of features argues for the presence of a symmetry which ( at least to very good approximation ) forbids the dark matter from decaying .",
    "the most straight - forward realization is a symmetry requiring dark matter to couple in pairs with the standard model and we can classify theories of dark matter based on how they realize this symmetry .",
    "the most well known example of such a symmetry is the @xmath3-parity often built into supersymmetric extensions of the sm to forbid dangerous interactions leading to large baryon- and lepton - number violation .",
    "while the fact that @xmath3-parity leads naturally to a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) that can play the role of dark matter makes it a very attractive ingredient , the existence of @xmath3-parity itself is somewhat ad hoc",
    ". it would be preferable to have a symmetry whose origin has a deeper motivation .",
    "a wide class of theories with extra dimensions naturally have such a symmetry .",
    "the existence of extra dimensions leads to additional spacetime symmetries , some remnant of which may survive compactification of the extra dimensions . in universal extra dimensions ( ued )",
    ", the entire standard model lives equally in all dimensions . as a result",
    ", there is naively a translational invariance along the extra dimensional directions which translates into conservation of kaluza klein ( kk ) number in the interactions of the modes @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the need for chiral fermions in the low energy theory selects orbifold compactifications which break the conservation of kk number into a @xmath4 symmetry , but this is sufficient to guarantee a stable particle which can play the role of dark matter .",
    "the simplest example of ued is a model with five dimensions ( 5d ) , four of which are ordinary spacetime with the remaining one compactified into a line segment of length @xmath5 .",
    "the lightest kaluza klein ( kk ) mode is stable , and provided it is weakly interacting , can take the role of dark matter in the universe .",
    "a standard thermal history of the universe results in the correct relic density for masses on the order of several hundred gev @xcite , a region which is also consistent with tevatron and precision electroweak bounds @xcite and a discovery of at least part of the first level of kk modes at the lhc @xcite .",
    "there are also prospects for direct @xcite and indirect @xcite detection by experiments in the near future .    in this article",
    ", we focus in particular on the prospects for detecting gamma rays from annihilation of wimps in the galactic halo . gamma rays",
    "offer a particularly promising avenue to detect wimp annihilations , because they point back to their sources , unlike charged particles , which are at the mercy of the galactic magnetic fields .",
    "however , the backgrounds from gamma ray sources are not very well understood , particularly around the galactic center where the concentration of wimps is greatest .",
    "thus , we focus on the particular signal of a two body annihilation of two wimps into a photon and another particle , which produces monochromatic photons , resulting in a  line \" in the energy spectrum of gamma rays .",
    "this feature is sufficiently distinct from anything produced by conventional astrophysics so as to perhaps balance the smaller rate caused by the fact that it is a loop - induced process @xcite .",
    "the fermi gamma ray observatory is actively searching for such lines as an unequivocal signal of dark matter @xcite , and predictions from a wide variety of particle physics models have appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "previous calculations in the context of the five dimensional ued model have computed the line signal from wimps annihilating into @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we extend these results to include @xmath1 and @xmath2 final states ( and we independently verify the results of @xcite , finding agreement for the @xmath0 channel ) .",
    "while both @xmath1 and @xmath2 turn out to be subdominant compared to the predicted @xmath0 signal , they would be important as follow - up signals in the event of the observation of the @xmath0 line , in order to distinguish the 5d ued model from other possibilities .",
    "for example , the relative strengths of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines encodes the fact that the lkp couples proportionally to hypercharge , and the existence of a @xmath2 line , in addition to being interesting in its own right , is only expected to be visible for a wimp which is a vector ( such as the lkp ) or a dirac fermion .",
    "we proceed as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we briefly review the 5 dimensional ued model , and the couplings necessary for our later computations . sections  [ sec : continuum ] and [ sec : lines ] respectively cover the expected gamma ray continuum and lines resulting from lkp annihilations .",
    "astrophysical inputs , the effects of finite detector energy resolution , and the gamma ray spectra are assembled in section  [ sec : flux ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the 5d ued model @xcite consists of the ordinary four large space + time dimensions , with one additional spatial dimension compactified into a line segment of length @xmath5 .",
    "generic points in five dimensional space can be written @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the subspace of the four large spacetime dimensions and @xmath8 is the compact dimension .",
    "the standard model field content is promoted to functions of the complete spacetime @xmath9 , with the zero modes in the kaluza - klein expansion identified with the familiar sm fields . in the discussion",
    "below , we will interchangeably refer to the ordinary sm fields as either  sm fields \" or ",
    "zero - modes \" .",
    "after electroweak symmetry - breaking , the lightest states obtain the usual sm masses , but we nonetheless continue to refer to them as zero modes in the kaluza - klein sense .    orbifold boundary conditions project out the zero modes of the fifth components of the gauge fields ( the higher components are eaten by the kk gauge bosons as per the usual extra - dimensional higgs mechanism ) and the unwanted zero mode degrees of freedom of the fermions .",
    "the boundary conditions lead inevitably @xcite to the presence of brane - localized terms which further shift the masses of the higher kk modes and break translational invariance along the extra dimension into a discrete parity under which the odd - numbered kk modes are odd and the even - numbered modes are even @xcite . as a consequence of this @xmath4 remnant symmetry ,",
    "the lightest first level kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) is stable .",
    "we follow the general picture of  minimal ued \" ( mued ) @xcite in which the brane terms take sizes which are dictated by loops of bulk couplings , but we do not strictly restrict ourselves to the masses and couplings of mued .",
    "consequently , the mass spectrum is chiefly characterized by the kk number @xmath10 , with the masses of all of the particles at that level given roughly by m_n .",
    "the boundary terms lead to corrections for the various particles within a given level .",
    "mued predicts the colored particles receive the largest positive corrections to their masses , followed by the @xmath11-charged states .",
    "the lightest kk modes of a given level are typically the kk modes of the right - handed charged leptons and the @xmath12 gauge boson itself .",
    "the lkp is thus the first level kk mode of @xmath13 , and represents a vector dark matter particle ( often refered to as the  kk photon \" ) which is a sm gauge singlet .",
    "its principle interactions are to a first level kk fermion and its corresponding zero mode , proportional to the hypercharge of the fermion in question and the gauge coupling @xmath14 .",
    "the primary couplings of interest here are the couplings of the lkp to one kk fermion and one zero mode fermion , and the couplings of ordinary photons , @xmath15 bosons , and higgs bosons to either zero mode or kk fermions .",
    "the photon couples to a pair of either sm or kk fermions proportional to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electric charge as usual .",
    "the sm higgs couples to a pair of zero modes proportionally to their mass , or to a pair of kk fermions ( one of which must be an @xmath11 doublet and the other an @xmath11 singlet ) proportionally to the mass of the analogue zero mode fermion .",
    "the sm @xmath15 boson has the standard chiral couplings to the sm fermions , and vector - like couplings to singlet ( @xmath18 ) and doublet ( @xmath19 ) kk fermions given by : - ( g_v + g_a ) z_|_s^(1 ) ^_s^(1 ) [ eq : zxixi_s ] and : - ( g_v - g_a ) z_|_d^(1 ) ^_d^(1 ) [ eq : zxixi_d ] where @xmath20 is the first level kk mode of a sm @xmath11 doublet , and @xmath21 is the first level kk mode of a sm singlet .",
    "@xmath22 are the sine ( cosine ) of the weak mixing angle and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined as : @xmath25 the @xmath26 couples to one sm fermion and one kk fermion as : @xmath27 and : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the zero mode fermion .",
    "annihilations of two lkps is predominantly into charged leptons ( @xmath30 ) , with significant fractions into quarks ( @xmath31 ) , neutrinos ( @xmath32 ) , and higgs bosons ( @xmath33 ) @xcite . the fact that a large fraction of annihilations produces hard charged leptons has the consequence that the continuum gamma ray signal is itself rather hard @xcite , which distinguishes the 5d continuum spectrum from the six dimensional chiral square model @xcite . the resulting continuum spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fg : continuum ] as a function of @xmath34 , the fraction of energy of the final state photon normalized to the lkp mass .",
    "comparing curves for lkp masses of 300 , 500 , and 1000  tev , we see little difference in the photon spectrum , which is easily explained by the fact that the annihilations are almost entirely into light sm particles .",
    "in addition to a diffuse continuum of gamma rays , wimp annihilations are also expected to produce prompt photons via loop - level processes .",
    "these types of annihilations produce @xmath35 final states ( where @xmath36 can be either a vector gauge boson or a scalar ) and result in mono - energetic `` lines '' superimposed on the continuum .",
    "the energy of these lines are determined almost solely by the mass of the wimp and the @xmath36 particle : @xmath37 due to the non - relativistic nature of wimps , the possible final states ( i.e. , the identity of @xmath36 ) are determined by the spin of the dm particle . in the case of the 5d ued model ,",
    "the wimp is a vector gauge boson and , hence , @xmath36 can be either a vector or a scalar .",
    "in other words , wimp annihilations in the 5d ued model are capable of producing @xmath38 , @xmath1 and ( if kinematically - accessible ) @xmath2 final states ( where @xmath39 is the sm higgs boson ) .",
    "the production of the @xmath38 final state in the 5d ued model was first considered in ref  @xcite . here , we will focus on the other two possible final states ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and we refer the interested reader to the above reference for details on the calculation of the @xmath38 cross section .",
    "we have verified the results from the previous analysis and we present the numerical results for the flux in the following sections .",
    "representative feynman diagrams depicting the process @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 or @xmath39 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : feynman - diagrams ] .",
    "note that since the lkp is to very good approximation pure @xmath26 ( @xmath42 for mued boundary terms and @xmath43  gev @xcite ) , loops containing @xmath44 and/or kk charged goldstone bosons are suppressed by the tiny @xmath45 content .",
    "we neglect these tiny contributions compared to the dominant diagrams consisting of closed loops of sm and kk fermions .      for the @xmath46 process",
    ", we assign lorentz indices and momenta as b^(1)__1(p_1 ) + b^(1)__2(p_2 ) _ _ 3(p_3 ) + z__4(p_4 ) . following ref .",
    "@xcite , the scattering amplitude involving four external gauge bosons can be written as : @xmath47 in general , the subamplitude @xmath48 can be expanded in terms of metric tensors and external momenta .",
    "taking into account the transversality of the polarization tensors ( @xmath49 ) and the non - relativistic nature of wimps today ( such that @xmath50 ) , the most general form is given by : @xmath51 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\equiv \\frac{\\alpha_y \\alpha_{em}}{4 c_w s_w } \\sum_{\\ell } q_\\ell { \\cal{a}}_{za,\\ell}^{\\mu_1 \\mu_2 \\mu_3 \\mu_4}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have pulled out a common factor with @xmath52 and we sum over all charged fermions running in the loop . the fact that the wimps are annihilating nearly at rest ( i.e. , @xmath53 also allows one to define the @xmath54-axis in the center - of - mass frame as the axis along which the final state particles are traveling .",
    "this simplifies things greatly as many of the dot products between polarization tensors and momentum vectors vanish .",
    "accounting for this and imposing conservation of momentum ( @xmath55 ) , we find that the only remaining tensor structures are @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "computation of the loop integrals in wimp annihilations is complicated by the fact that two of the incoming momenta are nearly identical . in these configurations , usual approaches such as the passarino - veltman scheme",
    "@xcite for computing tensor integrals break down and one must rely on alternative schemes in order to safely compute one - loop scattering amplitudes . we have chosen to use the scheme introduced in ref .",
    "this scheme was most recently used to compute one - loop wimp annihilation scattering amplitudes and we refer the interested reader to in ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "squaring the amplitude and summing / averaging over all polarizations , we find that the cross section for @xmath58 takes the form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",

    "the amplitudes for this process involve one less vector boson , and thus have a simpler tensor structure than the @xmath1 case .",
    "in fact , due to the scalar coupling of the higgs boson , the only surviving terms from the trace over the internal fermion line are proportional to levi - civita tensors @xmath63 contracted with at least one of the external momenta . instead of expanding the scattering amplitude in terms of all possible permutations , we only list the surviving terms once the non - relativistic nature of the wimps and conservation of momentum are applied .",

    "baryons however are expected to have a non - negligible effect on the small scale dynamics of galaxies .",

[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     recently , a large suite of cosmological simulations aimed to study the assembly of milky way like galaxies were carried out using the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code ramses , which includes treatment of dark matter , gas and stars @xcite .",
    "the modeling included realistic recipes for star formation , supernova feedback ( snii and snia ) , stellar mass loss , gas cooling/ heating and metal enrichment .",
    "it was found that adopting different prescriptions for the star formation history results in a strong difference not only in galactic disk size and concentration , but also on dm contraction , therefore dramatically affecting the dm profile in the innermost regions of galactic halos .",
    "these simulations were shown to bracket the so - called kennicutt - schmidt relation ( that parametrizes the star formation rate as a function of the gas density ) from the things survey @xcite , and they are therefore representative of milky way - like galaxies in the local universe . a comparison of the profiles obtained in these simulations with the standard dm - only case can be found e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is also shown that the final profile is substantially different with respect to a nave implementation of adiabatic contraction .",
    "we also stress that dm halos in numerical simulations deviate rather strongly from spherical symmetry , a circumstance that introduces additional uncertainties on the estimate of the integral along the line of sight @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "other processes due to the gravitational interaction of baryons ( such as the  heating \" of the dm fluid ) can possibly have the opposite effect on the final dm distribution and soften the central cusps .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a super - massive black hole ( bh ) at the gc inevitably affects the dm profile .",
    "the growth of the bh from an initial small seed would initially lead to a large dm `` spike '' @xcite .",

    "in what follows , the predicted gamma ray flux from the galactic center is obtained assuming the nfw halo profile . to obtain predictions for other profiles , it is sufficient to rescale the flux by the appropriate ratio of @xmath83 ( which is @xmath96 for a nave implementation of adiabatic contraction )",

    "[ fg : flux - mb1000 ] , [ fg : flux - mb500 ] and [ fg : flux - mb300 ] , we show predictions for the flux for an nfw halo profile and three choices of lkp mass .",
    "although the thermal relic density favors lkps in the range of 500 - 900 gev @xcite , we consider a wider range of lkp masses motivated by the possibility that the lkp is not a canonical thermal relic , which could allow for a wider range of masses consistent with the observed quantity of dark matter in the universe .",
    "for example , if the modulus which controls the size of the extra dimension is cosmologically active , it could cause large deviations in the thermodynamics of the universe from its extrapolated history @xcite .",
    "alternately , early production of kk gravitons which eventually decay into lkps can serve as a nonthermal production mechanism for kk dark matter in an otherwise standard cosmological history @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fg : flux - mb1000 ]  [ fg : flux - mb300 ] contain curves for three different choices of energy resolutions , ranging from the @xmath106 resolution typical of current experiments , to an aggressive @xmath107 resolution which might be possible in future experiments .",
    "we find that at @xmath108 energy resolution , lines in the 5d ued model are very difficult to distinguish from the continuum . at a @xmath109 energy resolution , broad lines may appear for lkp masses around 300 gev , slightly above the lower bound from colliders . at @xmath107 , well separated lines for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are visible for light lkps , and some structure related to the @xmath2 line is visible for an lkp mass of around 500 gev .    in principle , we should compare our predicted flux with gamma ray observations , since data are available from a variety of gamma - ray telescopes , such as the fermi lat and air cherenkov telescopes like hess and magic .",
    "the comparison is however made complicated by the aforementioned uncertainties on the normalization of the predicted flux on one side , and on the other by the difficult interpretation of astrophysical data .",
    "it is for instance unclear at this stage whether known astrophysical sources can account for the energy spectrum obtained by fermi .",
    "a recent analysis of a @xmath110 found that the diffuse gamma - ray background and discrete sources , as estimated with standard astrophysical tools , can account for practically all the observed flux , but there is a small excess at energies @xmath111(1 ) gev , which may or may not be explained with an improved model of the galactic diffuse emission and with a better understanding of the systematic errors @xcite . at the same time , there is an ongoing debate on the possible origin of the point source observed by hess right at the galactic center @xcite .    in principle , once these issues are settled , and the astrophysical backgrounds are well - known , one can search for a dm signal even in the case where it provides a subdominant contribution to the total flux .",
    "more subtle features such as subdominant gamma - ray lines could therefore in principle emerge in the process of data analysis , in which case one could try to perform the program describe above , and search for additional lines that might shed light on the structure of the dark sector .",
    "extra dimensions are a fascinating possibility in the spectrum of physics beyond the standard model , one which leads to a unique mechanism to provide a stable wimp to play the role of dark matter .",
    "we have examined the gamma ray line signals for ued dark matter wimps , extending the results for @xmath0 in the literature @xcite to also include lines from @xmath1 and @xmath2 final states .",
    "our conclusions are that such lines are very challenging for the current generation of gamma ray observatories to resolve , but may be visible at the next generation of such experiments . as such experiments are designed , we hope our work will be of some value in evaluating their exciting physics capabilities .",
