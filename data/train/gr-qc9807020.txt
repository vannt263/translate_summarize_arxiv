    "kinematic cosmology rests on the property that flrw models are conformally flat , i.e. related to some regions of flat spacetimes by means of a conformal transformation of the metric , viz .",
    "@xmath0 where @xmath1 is the conformal factor . without performing such transformation",
    "it is always possible to find a transformation of coordinates that brings the initial flrw metrics to manifestly conformally flat forms .",

    "coordinate , @xmath15 , and null coordinates @xmath16 by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , the metric ( [ flrwcom ] ) takes the form @xmath19 .",
    "\\label{flrwint}\\ ] ] the transformation that turns the metric ( [ flrwint ] ) into a conformally flat metric is defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the cfs coordinates , and the function @xmath23 is given explicitly for the closed , flat and open models respectively by @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xcite 1975 ) . with this transformation the metric ( [ flrwint ] ) becomes @xmath27 ,   \\label{flrwcfs}\\ ] ] where the conformal factor satisfies the identity @xmath28 }                            { g^{\\prime } ( t + r ) g^{\\prime } ( t - r ) } , \\label{cfacident}\\ ] ] @xmath29 and @xmath30 denoting respectively the derivative of @xmath23 and the inverse function to @xmath23 . the relationship between the comoving coordinates @xmath31 and the cfs coordinates is readily obtained from the above definitions .",
    "it reads @xmath32 at this stage it is important to note that if one takes up the cfs metric ( [ flrwcfs ] ) instead of the conventional metric ( [ flrwcom ] ) one shifts the study of the space structure , i.e. the knowledge of the scale factor , which characterizes the dynamics of the model under consideration to the analysis of the types of motion of fundamental particles ( kinematics ) . in total agreement with @xcite ( 1945 )",
    "we stress here that these types of motions have no straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "if one s aim is to study the dynamics in cfs coordinates one has to follow @xcite s ( 1967 ) approach , i.e. solve einstein s equations for the conformal factor @xmath33 .",
    "the would - be advantage of choosing the cfs metric ( [ flrwcfs ] ) lies in the fact that light rays propagate on straight lines with constant velocity in cfs coordinates ( because conformal transformations preserve the light cone structure  of minkowski spacetime in this case ) . in the line of @xcite ( 1947 ) one can set a good illustration of this property by deriving a general formula for the redshift of distant objects in cfs coordinates .",
    "consider an atom , moving with a fundamental particle @xmath34 of radial velocity @xmath35 and emitting photons with a proper period @xmath36 in the direction of an observer at @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the present cfs time .",
    "the corresponding null geodesics of the cfs metric ( [ flrwcfs ] ) are straight lines , @xmath39 .",
    "the proper emitted wavelength is @xmath40 , and the proper observed wavelength is @xmath41 .",
    "therefore the redshift is given by @xmath42 one clearly sees that in cfs coordinates there are two contributions to the redshift , namely the gravitational and doppler effects .",
    "note that equation ( [ redcfs ] ) could be obtained by performing the transformation ( [ comcfs ] ) on the standard formula @xmath43 at this stage we arrive at the very key - stone of endean s work since this author looks at the consequences of expressing the redshift formula ( [ redcom ] ) in terms of the cfs coordinates .",
    "there are no a priori objections against such a procedure provided one bears in mind the unphysical nature of cfs coordinates",
    ". however , endean overrules the fundamental postulate of general relativity , namely the general covariance of the physical laws , by ascribing an absolute physical meaning to cfs coordinates .",
    "it should be clear that this infringment is simply not acceptable for there is no reason whatsoever to forsake the coordinate invariance of physical laws .",
    "for instance , @xcite ( 1997 ) claims that cfs time @xmath44 correctly measures the true age of the universe whereas , by definition , the genuine elapsed time is the proper cosmic time @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , in contrast to @xcite ( 1945 ) , endean merges purely kinematic concepts into dynamical ones , asserting that the radial velocity @xmath45 may be interpreted as the cosmological recession velocity . underpinning his arguments on such mistaken assumptions",
    "conveys endean to startling conclusions as for instance the vanishing of spacetime singularities ( see  3.3 . ) .",
    "for the sake of briefness we now restrict ourself to the closed flrw cosmological model with dust in order to show up the fallacies present in @xcite ( 1997 ) .",
    "for our purpose we focus the discussion on the behaviour of the scale factor and of the cosmological parameters expressed in cfs coordinates .",
    "the exact solution of einstein s equations describing a closed flrw model filled with dust can be found in any textbook on cosmology and reads , in terms of @xmath14 ,    @xmath46    [ sol ]    where @xmath47 is a constant of integration which could be determined in principle from the knowledge of the present values of the hubble constant @xmath48 and the mass density of the universe , @xmath49 with @xmath50 denoting the present density parameter . on the other hand , the time flow in cfs coordinates",
    "is not the same as the proper cosmic time flow .",
    "the relationship between a @xmath5-clock and a @xmath44-clock is indeed given by    @xmath51    [ tclock ]    turning aside from the interpretation of equations ( [ tclock ] ) @xcite ( 1997 ) states a new `` principle of identical clock rates '' asserting that the flows of cfs and cosmic times are identical , viz .",
    "this , a major offense , shows unambiguously that cfs cosmology is fundamentally unsound .",
    "for instance , this `` principle '' has the awkward consequence that @xmath47 is no longer constant but determined as a function of @xmath14 , namely @xmath53 .",
    "this is in total contradiction with the exact solution ( [ sol ] ) . in that case",
    "the ( wrong ) scale factor becomes @xmath54 and tends to infinity as @xmath14 tends to @xmath55 . on account of these misconceptions",
    "@xcite ( 1997 ) deduces that the scale factor can not reach its maximum value either in a finite cfs time or in a finite cosmic time , and that this maximum is infinite . as another consequence of this `` principle ''",
    "endean finds that the conformal factor must fulfill the condition @xmath56 for all @xmath38 .",
    "he then infers from this result a property he calls a `` strong copernician principle '' enabling him to conclude that cfs coordinates measure the true distances and elapsed times in the universe and that these measures do not depend on the location of the observers .",
    "the `` strong copernician principle '' is obviously wrong , for the conformal factor ( [ cfacident ] ) becomes in the closed flrw model , @xmath57 ^ 2 / \\nonumber \\\\                 & & \\quad \\left [ 1+x^2 \\right]^2 \\left [ 1+y^2 \\right]^2 , \\label{cfaccfs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 have been defined above and @xmath59 only for @xmath60 and @xmath61      from the exact solution ( [ sol ] ) it is straightforward to obtain the hubble and deceleration parameters as functions of @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath68 in analogy with equation ( [ redl ] ) @xcite ( 1994 ) identifies the coefficient in front of the first order term in equation ( [ redr ] ) as a new hubble parameter @xmath69 which would be the observed hubble parameter if cfs coordinates were physically meaningful . as we know that it is not the case",
    ", the introduction of @xmath69 is completely irrelevant .",
    "( notice also that the `` principle of identical clock rates '' implies @xmath70 @xcite s ( 1997 ) subsequent discussion on the timing test in cfs coordinates is therefore unnecessary .",
    "the occurrence of spacetime singularities is a generic feature of spatially homogeneous models ( @xcite 1973 ) .",
    "all flrw cosmological models exhibit a singularity in the past ( big - bang ) where at @xmath71 the mass - energy density goes to infinity .",
    "in addition , the closed model recollapses towards a singularity in the future ( big - crunch ) after a finite proper time . in total contradiction with these facts , @xcite ( 1997 ) concludes that neither the big - bang nor the big - crunch take place in the closed flrw model if it is examined from the point of view of cfs coordinates . with regard to the initial singularity he grounds his reasoning on the fact that the radial cfs velocity @xmath45 ( mistakenly considered as the recession velocity ) ,",
    "vanishes when @xmath72 we prove now , if necessary , that the initial singularity fairly exists in cfs coordinates . for our purpose",
    "we consider the curvature invariant constructed on the riemann tensor , viz .",
    "its expansion as the cfs time tends to zero is given at the leading order by @xmath74 and thus diverges .",
    "note that @xcite ( 1967 ) also found a diverging energy density .",
    "concerning the final singularity now , it is obvious from equation ( [ tcl ] ) that if one ascribes a physical meaning to a @xmath44-clock as in @xcite ( 1997 ) then the universe will never be seen to recollapse since @xmath75 as @xmath76 , the value @xmath77 corresponding to the maximum radius ( see eq . [ [ sol ] ] ) .",
    "therefore , endean s claim of a non - recollapsing closed universe is also totally wrong .",
    "in this paper we have shown up the fallacious assumptions founding endean s cfs cosmology .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "first of all , cfs coordinates do not measure true distances and elapsed times in the universe .",
    "this is an obvious statement on account of the definition of cfs coordinates and of the mere inspection of the cfs metric ( [ flrwcfs ] ) .",
    "( coordinates are nothing else than labels for events occurring in spacetime , and it is the metric , eventually , that tells us how to measure distances and time intervals . ) on the one hand endean s opposite claim with respect to elapsed times rests on his totally unjustified `` principle of identical clock rates . ''",
    "on the other hand his assertion stating that the cfs radial distance represents a true measure of distance is partly based on a direct consequence of this `` principle , '' and partly justified from a suitable fitting of redshift - distance curves ( @xcite 1995 ) .",
    "we stress however that reproducing curve shapes can never replace a reliable theoretical framework .",
    "secondly , the occurrence of singularities in flrw cosmological models is by no means altered upon introducing cfs coordinates  physical results are coordinate invariant .",
    "endean s opposite conclusion reveals that his argumentation rests on the serious misconceptions mentioned above concerning the absolute physical meaning ascribed to cfs coordinates which breaks the general covariance principle . on account of these facts",
    "we conclude that endean s cfs cosmology is totally unsound and ought to be discarded .",
