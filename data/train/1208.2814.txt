    "quantum mechanics is nonlocal in the sense that no local hidden variable theories can simulate quantum mechanical correlations @xcite .",
    "the nonlocality of quantum mechanics can be demonstrated by a violation of inequalities on measurable correlations . in the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality",
    "the degree of violation is represented by the value of the chsh parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the quantum upper bound of @xmath0 , the degree of nonlocality , is known as tsirelson s bound @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "they derived `` superquantum '' correlation by using two axioms of nonlocality and relativistic causality .",
    "the maximum value @xmath2 of @xmath0 is obtained for popescu - rohrlich ( pr ) nonlocal boxes @xcite .",
    "the nonlocality of the pr box is limited only by the no - signaling principle whereby no information can be transferred faster than the speed of light . therefore we naturally ask a question on the possibility of the existence of modified quantum theories , so called post - quantum theories , which are more nonlocal than the quantum theory and limited only by the no - signaling principle .",
    "the properties of post - quantum theories are studied by several authors in an information theoretic view @xcite . as far as we know , however , there is no approach to find post - quantum theories by extending the quantum theory directly .",
    "the main postulates of the quantum theory are consisted of two parts .",
    "one is for a system and a time evolution of the system , which is based on a ray in a hilbert space and a unitary evolution operator @xcite .",
    "the other is for a measurement interpretation .",
    "hilbert space based description of physical states is natural for a linear quantum mechanics .",
    "projective measurement postulate , however , is justified only by experiments .",
    "the study on the possibility of higher - path interferences than two - path interference which corresponds to the generalization of the born rule has been done both in theories and in experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore modifications of measurement postulates are good candidates for extending the quantum mechanics to more nonlocal post - quantum mechanics .    in the present paper",
    ", we treat the problem to find the possibility of post - quantum theories by asking a question of simulating the pr box by modifications of quantum probability postulate for quantum measurements . the standard quantum probability rule known as the born rule",
    "is considered to be restricted by gleason s theorem @xcite .",
    "gleason s theorem states that the only consistent probability assignment for all projection operators on hilbert spaces dimension at least three must follow the standard quantum probability rule . in our study",
    "we will consider an entangled state which lives in 4-dimensional hilbert space , therefore , it seems the modification of the born rule is prohibited by gleason s theorem in simple - minded consideration , however , in our bipartite system only the local projection operators for each party are allowed . on the other hand , to prove gleason s theorem all possible projection operators including the global operators must be involved .",
    "moreover , the noncontextuality of probability induced by gleason s propositions is lack of physical basis .",
    "we impose the no - signaling condition instead of the noncontextuality which is compatible with the relativity on the hilbert space formalism of the physical states .",
    "we will organize this paper as follows .",
    "we will explain the formalism of the modification of the born rule in section 2 .",
    "in section 3 we will show the joint probability distribution of the pr box can be simulated by the maximally entangled state under the modified born rule . in section 4",
    "we will study the nonlocality of other nonlocal boxes which can be obtained systematically by changing the observables and the quantum probability rule . in section 5",
    "we will summarize our results and discuss the implications of the results .",
    "in our study , we assume that a physical state is described by a vector @xmath3 in a hilbert space with usual norm @xmath4 . a physical observable",
    "is represented by a linear and hermitian operator @xmath5 .",
    "an observable @xmath5 has real eigenvalues @xmath6 and mutually orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "physical observables satisfy the following measurement postulates : i ) an outcome of measurement is always an eigenvalue of @xmath5 .",
    "ii ) the probability of an outcome @xmath9 for an initial state @xmath3 is obtained with @xmath10 .",
    "iii ) the quantum state after the measurement that gives the outcome @xmath9 reduces to the corresponding eigenstate @xmath11 . where @xmath12 is the function which assigns the probability for the outcome @xmath9 .",
    "the postulate ii ) is the quantum probability rule , which is called the born rule .",
    "the born rule states that @xmath13 in a density matrix formulation . where @xmath14 is the expectation value of the observable @xmath5 and @xmath15 is a density operator @xmath16 .",
    "let us analyze the modification of the quantum theory .",
    "for this purpose , let us consider the possibility of changing the postulate ii ) of the quantum measurement . according to gleason s theorem probability assignment for each vector of an orthonormal basis @xmath7 associated with the state vector @xmath3",
    "must be @xmath17 under a non - contextual condition , in dimensions at least three . in our study",
    "we will consider entangled states of two qubits which live in 4-dimensional hilbert space , hence , it seems that the modification of the born rule is restricted by gleason s theorem .",
    "this , however , is not the case in our physical situation .",
    "suppose alice and bob are in spacelike separated positions and share an entangled state .",
    "we impose a physical requirement that every projective measurement by alice and bob must be local .",
    "this requirement is compatible with the theory of relativity .",
    "therefore only product type local projectors such as @xmath18 are allowed , where subscripts @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent alice and bob respectively . for simplicity",
    "we assume that alice measures first and bob measures second so that we only involve @xmath21 in our theory . in gleason s proposition , however , any projection operators",
    "are allowed so our situation is different from the proposition of gleason .",
    "we impose only the condition of the no - signaling and local observables as a physical requirement on the hilbert space formalism of the physical state .",
    "the condition of the no - signaling and local observables is compatible with the theory of relativity which restricts faster - than - light signaling .",
    "we prefer that the modification from the quantum theory is as small as possible .",
    "therefore we will use the standard born rule for the quantum measurements of alice and modify the born rule only for the quantum probability rule of bob .",
    "first we will explain the modification of the born rule in two - dimensional hilbert space for simplicity . for a linear and hermitian operator @xmath5 with two orthonormal eigenstates @xmath22 and @xmath23 , when a system in a state @xmath24 is measured , measurement probabilities to get outcomes @xmath25 and @xmath26 are modified from the born rule to more general functions such as @xmath27 respectively . where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are some non - negative functions which satisfy the following obvious conditions ; @xmath30 ( normalization ) , @xmath31 ( bases relabeling invariance ) , @xmath32 ( phase redefinition invariance ) , and @xmath33 ( state normalization ) .",
    "the born rule corresponds to @xmath34 .",
    "we will call this modified assignment for measurement probability as modified quantum probability rule. after a measurement the state @xmath3 is projected either to @xmath35 or @xmath36 as the same in the quantum mechanics .",
    "we will first apply this modified quantum probability rule to study the possibility of simulating the pr box .",
    "suppose alice and bob share two boxes with inputs and outputs in their locations .",
    "let @xmath37 be inputs of alice and bob , and @xmath38 be outputs for alice and bob respectively .",
    "the pr box is defined by these two boxes with inputs and outputs having the following hypothetical correlations : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes an addition modulo @xmath41 . for the above correlations the joint probability @xmath42 and for the other cases @xmath43 .",
    "we have used a normalization in which the sum of @xmath2 possible outcomes to the given inputs is unity .",
    "it is known that the pr box correlations are nonlocal and can not be reproduced classically and quantum mechanically @xcite .",
    "+      our purpose is to study the possibility of making the hypothetical correlations of the pr box between alice and bob by quantum states with the modified quantum probability rule for bob s measurement .",

    "alice and bob each have two different axis of measurement such as in fig .",

    "bob takes measurements along either @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) or @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) directions .",

    "( [ eq : staterelation ] ) hold between eigenstates @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we will explain calculations of @xmath66 for the initial state @xmath67 with some typical inputs and outcomes under the modified quantum probability rule for bob s measurement and summarize all results .",
    "we assume alice and bob are not moving relative to each other in order not to make any complexity related to simultaneity .",
    "under our proposition the measurement of alice is taken first and the quantum probability rule for alice is governed by the usual born rule . after the measurement of alice the projected state becomes the pure separable state and so bob s measurement is taken on the pure state in his two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the probability of bob s measurement will follow the modified quantum probability rule .",
    "let us first consider a calculation of @xmath68 . in our case",
    "the @xmath68 is calculated by the probability of outcome @xmath69 in bob s @xmath61 measurement under the condition that alice s outcome @xmath70 is given in her @xmath54 measurement .",
    "the outcome @xmath70 for @xmath54 is given only by @xmath71 term of the initial state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) .",
    "the projection probability from the initial state to @xmath72 state is @xmath73 since this projection is taken by alice s measurement .",
    "after the measurement of alice , bob s state projected onto the state @xmath74 because of the entanglement .",
    "this state gives outcome @xmath69 for the measurement @xmath61 with probability @xmath50 .",
    "therefore @xmath75 . for measurement axis @xmath54 and @xmath61 there are no new results related to the modified quantum probability rule for bob s measurement since the state of bob after alice s measurement is not a superposition of two outcome states .",
    "that is , @xmath76 for @xmath77 and vice versa in eq . (",
    "[ eq : modify ] ) .",
    "next consider @xmath63 case , for example , @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath70 and @xmath54 the state of bob is projected onto @xmath74 with probability @xmath73 as before . since bob will take the @xmath63 measurement , the state of bob must be rewritten as @xmath79 by using the eigenstates of the @xmath63 measurement , @xmath80 and @xmath81 corresponding to outcomes @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the outcome probability will be obtained by our modified quantum probability rule such that the probability of outcome @xmath69 for @xmath63 measurement will be @xmath82 .",
    "therefore @xmath83    one of other nontrivial cases is @xmath84 . here",
    "bob s measurement looks the same as that in the first case of @xmath68 , however , the nontriviality appears because of the different measurement of alice . to get this joint probability alice must take her measurement with @xmath56 first . in this case the initial state",
    "must be rewritten by using the eigenstates of @xmath55 measurement such as @xmath85 then the probability of outcome @xmath70 for @xmath55 is @xmath86 according to the born rule .",
    "after the measurement of alice the state of bob is projected onto the following normalized state , @xmath87 the probability of outcome @xmath69 for @xmath61 measurement will be @xmath88 according to the modified quantum probability rule .",
    "therefore the result becomes @xmath89 note that only local measurement of bob follows our new quantum probability rule and the others are governed by the standard born rule .",
    "the summary of all results for the probability distributions @xmath66 are as follows : + 1 . for @xmath54 and @xmath61 measurements , @xmath90 the total probability @xmath91 which is the sum of all possible outcomes for inputs @xmath54 and @xmath61 , i.e.",

    "we will study constraints on the functional form of modified quantum probability @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modify ] ) under the no - signaling condition .",
    "the no - signaling condition between alice and bob requires that an outcome of bob s measurement must not depend on the choice of measurement axes of alice .",
    "this condition is satisfied when @xmath106 for all values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "where @xmath109 is @xmath110 mod 2 . as a specific example",
    "let us consider @xmath69 and @xmath61 case . in this case",
    "the no - signaling condition becomes @xmath111 which gives @xmath112 the equality can not be satisfied in general by arbitrary functions @xmath113 . here",
    "@xmath51 is the angle of alice s measurement axis so that alice can determine her @xmath51 arbitrarily .",
    "the theory which restricts on the measurement axis can not be considered as a proper physical theory .",
    "there are two kinds of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nosignal ] ) for arbitrary @xmath51 .",
    "one is @xmath114 which becomes the bell state .",
    "the post - quantum theories must include other states than the bell state because of the symmetry of a hilbert space .",
    "a unitary evolution corresponding to a symmetry operation in a hilbert space will change the bell state to other state in general .",
    "therefore this solution can not give a full physical theory .",
    "another kind can be found by setting @xmath115 , then the functional form of @xmath116 are determined such as @xmath117 which is the born rule .",
    "this implies even the minimal modification of the quantum probability rule only for bob is restricted by no - signaling condition .",
    "therefore , we conclude that we can not make a post - quantum theory by the modification of the quantum probability rule from the born rule without violating no - signaling principle .",
    "it is still interesting , however , to consider whether the pr box can be simulated by our model since the concrete mechanism for generating non - local boxes including the pr box is lack except the linear combinations or wiring of two nonlocal boxes @xcite .    to simulate the non - local boxes we use the following explicit functional form for the probability assignment @xmath118 when the initial state @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) is the bell state , i.e. , for @xmath119 the probability distributions @xmath66 become @xmath120 one can easily check that the no - signaling condition is satisfied for arbitrary @xmath51 , @xmath62 , and @xmath121 .",
    "this implies that there is no restriction on the measurement angle for the bell state .",
    "the condition that the above probability distributions reproduce the probability distributions of the pr box requires , in the limit of @xmath122 , @xmath123 to satisfy the above requirements , the angle @xmath51 must be either in the first or the fourth quadrant and the angle @xmath62 either in the second or the third quadrant . additionally , the angles @xmath51 and @xmath62 also have to satisfy one of @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "there is always a suitable @xmath62 for any @xmath51 to satisfy one of those conditions . for these angles the probabilities go to @xmath127 for inputs and outcomes which satisfy @xmath128 and zeros for others in the limit of @xmath122 .",
    "these probability distributions are the same as those of the pr box",

    "<S> we have studied the possibility of post - quantum theories more nonlocal than the ( standard ) quantum theory using the modification of the quantum probability rule under the no - signaling condition . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the situation that two spacelike separate parties alice and bob share an entangled two qubit system . </S>",
    "<S> we have modified the quantum probability rule as small as possible such that the first local measurements are governed by the usual born rule and the second measurement by the modified quantum probability rule . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that only the maximally entangled states can have higher nonlocality than the quantum upper bound while satisfying the no - signaling condition . </S>",
    "<S> this fact could be a partial explanation for why the nonlocality of the quantum theory is limited . as a by - product </S>",
    "<S> we have found the systematic way to obtain a variety of nonlocal boxes . </S>"
