    "ir wavelengths show that sgr b2 is the brightest and among the most massive clouds of the gc ( cox & laureijs 1989 , pierce  price et al .",
    "2000 ; scoville , solomon & penzias 1975 ) .",
    "the sgr b2 m source is the brightest far  ir condensation of the complex with a diameter of @xmath1240@xmath15 at 100 @xmath9 m ( goldsmith et al .",
    "1992 ) and has also the largest gas column density ( lis & goldsmith 1989 ) .",
    "these studies have shown that the core is embedded in an extended and clumpy cloud of warm gas . however , the observed rich chemistry in the gas in front of sgr b2 and its possible heating mechanisms are far from settled .",
    "low velocity shocks have been invoked to explain the enhanced abundances of some species such as nh@xmath16 or nh@xmath17 ( flower , pineau des forts & walmsley 1995 ) which are not observed in more quiescent regions . on the other hand ,",
    "uv radiation can have an important effect on the gas in the outer layers .",
    "this radiation may be provided by evolved stars and by young massive stars in the envelope of sgr b2 itself ( martn  pintado et al .",
    "in addition , the emission of several ions with high excitation potential ( such as [ oiii ] and [ niii ] ) is extended in the sgr b2 region ( goicoechea et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "thus , a widespread ionized component producing photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) in the envelope is also possible . in any of these scenarios or in a combination of both ,",
    "o  bearing species such as h@xmath16o , oh , h@xmath17o@xmath18 and atomic oxygen are decisive for the thermal balance of the dense molecular gas ( neufeld et al .",
    "in particular , the hydroxyl radical , oh , has been predicted to be abundant in both scenarios .    the structure of the oh levels is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the fundamental rotational @xmath8doublet ( @xmath2119 @xmath9 m ) was first detected in the direction of sgr b2 in absorption against the thermal dust emission by storey , watson & townes ( 1981 ) .",
    "each line of the doublet is so optically thick that absorbs completely the continuum radiation avoiding any check with the models .",
    "these lines are detected over a large area ( 9@xmath1927@xmath20 ) around sgr b2 ( cernicharo et al .",
    "a detailed study of the far - ir spectrum of oh has been carried out mainly in the orion shocked region ( watson et al .",
    "1985 ; viscuso et al .",
    "1985 ; melnick et al . 1987 , 1990 ; betz & boreiko 1989 ) but little is known toward gc clouds such as the gas in the line of sight toward sgr b2 .    from the theoretical point of view , offer & van dishoeck ( 1992 ; hereafter ofd ) and offer , van hemert & van dishoeck ( 1994 ; hereafter ofhd ) have made detailed calculations of the collisional cross sections between oh and h@xmath16 and of the expected intensity of the oh far ",
    "they predicted strong asymmetries in the intensity of the oh @xmath8doublets due to important asymmetries in the collisional rates between oh and para - h@xmath16 .    in this letter , we present high  resolution observations of several oh @xmath8doublets toward sgr b2 involving levels up to @xmath2420 k. all lines inside the @xmath5 ladder are seen in emission while all the remaining lines are detected in absorption .",
    "the data have been modeled using a non - local radiative transfer code in order to constrain some important physical parameters of the warm outer layers of sgr b2 and of the foreground gas .",
    "most of the pure rotational lines of oh are in the far  ir wavelength coverage of the long - wavelength spectrometer ( lws ; clegg et al .",
    "1996 ) on board iso ( kessler et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the iso data base observations used in this letter are 32201429 , 32600502 , 46201118 46201123 , 46701803 , 47600809 , 47608099 , 49401705 , 50400823 , 50601013 , 50600603 , 50700610 , and 84500102 .",
    "the lws / fabry  perot ( fp ) spectral resolution is @xmath120.015 @xmath9 m ( @xmath235 km s@xmath3 ) and allows resolving the @xmath8doubling of oh and its isotopes .",
    "several oh rotational lines ( intra and cross  ladder ) were searched toward sgr b2 m. data are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the oh j= 5/2@xmath73/2 cross - ladder doublet at @xmath234 @xmath9 m was observed with the short - wavelength spectrometer ( sws ; de graauw et al .",
    "1996 ) with a spectral resolution of 1500 ( iso observation 28702002 ) .",
    "one component was observed with the sws / fp with a velocity resolution of @xmath210 km s@xmath3 ( iso observation 46001217 ) .",
    "when compared to the grating observation , the mean lws / fp continuum flux of each line deviates by at least 20% , similar to the grating flux calibration errors ( swinyard et al .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are always larger than the statistical errors associated with the line signal  to  noise ratios ( s / n ) .",
    "the best calibration is obtained by correcting the continuum level of the fp spectrum in order to coincide with the grating level .",
    "a polynomial baseline was fitted to each spectra and adopted as the continuum level .",
    "the effective sws / fp aperture in the @xmath234 @xmath9 m range is 17@xmath15@xmath1340@xmath15 , while the lws aperture is circular and @xmath280@xmath15 in diameter .",
    "all the sws and lws products were processed with version 10.1 of the pipeline and analyzed using the iso spectrometers data reduction package isap .",
    "sgr b2 m has been the target of several spectroscopic observations in the far  ir .",
    "molecular features have been always found in absorption .",
    "however , oh shows a different behavior . all rotational doublets connecting the @xmath0oh @xmath6 ground ",
    "state with the rotational levels of the @xmath5 ladder ( @xmath234 , 53 , 79 and 119 @xmath9 m ) are observed in absorption while the @xmath0oh @xmath5 intra - ladder rotational transitions at @xmath298 and @xmath2163 @xmath9 m are observed in emission .",
    "the @xmath279 and @xmath253 @xmath9 m @xmath8doublets have maximum absorption depths at the velocity of sgr b2 m ( v@xmath21@xmath12 + 50 km s@xmath3 ) . nevertheless , there is still a contribution from more negative velocity components associated with the `` spiral arms clouds '' in the line of sight and with the gas surrounding the gc , which we divide in two components ( @xmath22 and 0 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the n(h@xmath16 ) range found in these clouds varies from 10@xmath23 to 10@xmath10 @xmath11 ( greaves 1995 ) .",
    "the absorption depths at v@xmath21@xmath12 - 85 km @xmath24 are @xmath1230@xmath25 and @xmath1215@xmath25 for the @xmath279 and @xmath253 @xmath9 m doublets respectively .",
    "these components are thought to arise in the molecular gas within 1 kpc of the gc ( scoville 1972 ) .",
    "assuming that the absorption at these velocities is optically thin and considering only radiative excitation ( i.e. , low t@xmath26 ) , we derive @xmath27 for @xmath28@xmath12(510)@xmath1310@xmath29 @xmath30 ( see neufeld et al .",
    "2000 for a distribution of @xmath28 in the line of sight ) .",
    "the opacity of the oh lines at v@xmath21@xmath120 km s@xmath3 allows also to derive @xmath31 for @xmath28@xmath122.5@xmath1310@xmath32 @xmath30 .",
    "this component is believed to arise in the diffuse gas at galactocentric radii 38 kpc and in the solar vicinity ( greaves & williams 1994 ) .",
    "these values are higher than the typical oh abundances of 10@xmath33 found in diffuse and translucent clouds ( van dishoeck & black 1986 )",
    ".    the @xmath284 @xmath9 m doublet and the 34.603 @xmath9 m line component ( in absorption ) and the @xmath5 doublets at @xmath298 and @xmath2163 @xmath9 m ( in emission ) are strictly centered at the velocity of sgr b2 m and are decisive to understand the excitation scheme of the molecule .",
    "the iso data also provide upper limits to the emission / absorption of the j=3/2@xmath45/2 ( @xmath296 @xmath9 m ) and j=5/2@xmath45/2 ( @xmath248 @xmath9 m ) cross  ladder transitions and to the @xmath6 j=9/2@xmath47/2 ( @xmath265 @xmath9 m ) and @xmath5 j=7/2@xmath45/2 ( @xmath271 @xmath9 m ) @xmath8doublets of 1.5% of the continuum emission .",
    "finally , we present the detection of the fundamental @xmath1oh @xmath6 j= 5/2@xmath73/2 lines at @xmath2120 @xmath9 m . apart from the feature associated with sgr b2 , there is another absorption at v@xmath21 @xmath120 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the derived @xmath1oh column density is ( 2.5@xmath340.5)@xmath1310@xmath35 @xmath30 , implying an @xmath0oh/@xmath1oh abundance ratio in this component of @xmath2500 , similar to the terrestrial value .",
    "the typical oh abundance in dense quiescent clouds is ( 0.1 - 1)@xmath13 10@xmath33 with oh / h@xmath16o ratios in the range 1 to 10@xmath36 ( bergin et al .",
    "according to the chemical models , the major contribution to the enhanced oh abundance comes from regions where water vapor is being rapidly photodissociated ( sternberg & dalgarno 1995 ) or regions in which shock waves play a role ( draine et al .",
    "1983 ) . in the case of sgr b2 ,",
    "the innermost regions of the cloud are completely hidden in the mid and far - infrared due to the large dust opacity .",
    "almost all the observed far ",
    "ir oh come from the external layers of the sgr b2 cloud , i.e. , from the surrounding gas at high t@xmath37 and from the cold dark clouds and diffuse gas in the line of sight .    in order to estimate the oh abundance and the physical conditions leading to the observed oh line emission in the v@xmath38 km s@xmath3 component , we have modeled the first 20 oh rotational levels using the code developed by gonzlez - alfonso & cernicharo ( 1993 ) .",
    "the hyperfine structure of oh is not included in the model .",
    "the collisional cross sections of ofhd have been used ( kindly provided in electronic form by e.f van dishoeck ) .",
    "we have adopted a spherical geometry for a cloud consisting of two components : a uniform core with a diameter of 25@xmath15 ( 3.2@xmath1310@xmath1 cm for an assumed distance to sgr b2 of 8.5 kpc ) , with a dust temperature of 30 k ( see goicoechea & cernicharo , 2001 ) and opacity at 80 @xmath9 m of 5 ( @xmath39 ) , and a shell of variable thickness and distance to the core .",
    "the shell was divided into 14 layers .",
    "all molecular transitions in the core are thermalized to the dust temperature due to the large dust opacity in the far  ir . in order to check the sensitivity of the results on the physical parameters , @xmath40 , t@xmath37 and @xmath41",
    "were varied from 10@xmath42 to 10@xmath43 @xmath11 , 40 to 600 k , and 1@xmath1310@xmath44 up to 1@xmath1310@xmath45 @xmath30 respectively .",
    "the observations put some constraints on the size and density of the shell .",
    "excitation temperatures for the cross - ladder and @xmath6 transitions have to be below the dust temperature in order to reproduce the observed line absorptions .",
    "in addition , the shell thickness and its distance to the core can not be large compared to the core size , otherwise limb effects introduce important re - emission that could cancel the absorption produced by the gas in front of the core .",
    "the results for some models are reproduced in figure 2 .",
    "we have found that if the shell is placed at some distance from the core , then it is difficult to reproduce the observations as almost all lines appear in emission within the lws beam ( 80@xmath15 ) . even if the shell is contiguous to the core but large in thickness , lines also appear in emission .",
    "models in fig . 2 correspond to a total size of 42@xmath15 ( 5.3@xmath1310@xmath1 cm ) for the core+shell cloud .",
    "the model labelled m@xmath46 corresponds to t@xmath37=40 k , @xmath40=10@xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath47 . the cross - ladder and @xmath6 transitions are in absorption while the @xmath5 intra - ladder transitions are predicted in emission .",
    "however , although the intensity of the absorbing lines is found to fit reasonably well the observations , emission lines are underestimated . if the oh abundance is increased in order to reproduce the intensity of the emitting lines then , absorbing lines are poorly fitted as limb effects start to dominate .",
    "this effect is already seen in the j=1/2@xmath73/2 cross - ladder transition at @xmath279 @xmath9 m .",
    "in particular , the @xmath5 j=5/2@xmath43/2 transition at @xmath298 @xmath9 m is strongly underestimated by model m@xmath46 .",
    "if the gas temperature increases , collisions start to pump the oh levels and the intensity of the @xmath298 @xmath9 m line is better fitted",
    ". however , a new problem arises as strong asymmetries in the line intensities of each @xmath8-doubling line do appear at high temperature ( no asymmetries have been observed within the s / n ratio of the data ) .",
    "these asymmetries were already predicted by ofd and are due to a strong parity change propensity rule introduced by collisions with para  h@xmath16 .",
    "they can only be suppressed if the h@xmath16 ortho  to  para ( otp ) ratio is higher or if radiative pumping dominates .",
    "we have adopted a otp ratio of 3 .",
    "model m@xmath16 in fig .",
    "2 corresponds to t@xmath37=150 k with otherwise the same parameters as m@xmath46 .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath298 @xmath9 m doublet is considerably enhanced with respect to the low temperature model . the intensity asymmetry in this doublet",
    "is not visible in the data as the doublet is unresolved with the lws / fp spectrometer .",
    "the effect of the ir pumping strongly reduces the asymmetries that could be present without the optically thick core . finally , model m@xmath17 ( thick lines in figure 2 ) represents t@xmath37=300 k , @xmath40=5@xmath1310@xmath42 @xmath11 and @xmath48 .",
    "again , the strong asymmetry of the @xmath298 @xmath9 m doublet is not observable due to the lack of spectral resolution .",
    "however , the observed total intensity for the doublet agrees well with that predicted from the model . for the other lines",
    ", m@xmath17 reproduces qualitatively well the observed oh pattern , except in the line wings in the 119 and 79 @xmath9 m doublets .",
    "nevertheless , cold foreground gas ( not included in the model ) absorbs ( like in m@xmath46 ) at these wavelengths , reducing the emission wing effects in these lines .    from our models",
    "it is clear that the gas surrounding sgr b2 has to be warm ( see ceccarelli et al .",
    "2002 ) and must have a moderate h@xmath16 density .",
    "the oh abundance is rather high , ( 25)@xmath1310@xmath14 . assuming that m@xmath17 represents a reasonable fit to the oh data , we derive @xmath49@xmath1@xmath50=(6@xmath342)@xmath1310@xmath35 @xmath30 for sgr b2 .",
    "hence , the @xmath0o/@xmath1o isotopic ratio is 240280 , in excellent agreement with the value obtained by bujarrabal , cernicharo & gulin ( 1983 ) from the oh 18 cm lines and a factor @xmath122 lower than in the v@xmath21 @xmath120 km s@xmath3 component .",
    "higher t@xmath37 could even be possible but the actual collisional rates introduce very strong intensity asymmetries in the cross - ladder transitions which are not observed .",
    "if the gas temperature is higher , then its density has to be lower than the value used in m@xmath17 ( 5@xmath1310@xmath42 @xmath11 ) .",
    "the reason is that higher temperatures produce strong emission in the oh high excitation transitions ( @xmath271 and @xmath265 @xmath9 m for example , see figure 2 ) which is not observed . for t@xmath37=600",
    "k , @xmath40 has to be decreased to ( 1 - 2)@xmath1310@xmath42 @xmath11 and @xmath51 increased to ( 0.5 - 1)@xmath1310@xmath52 to obtain a crude fit the iso data .",
    "a temperature gradient across the shell , going from t@xmath37=40 k in the innermost regions to t@xmath37=600 k in the external layers is probably a better representation to the physical structure of the edge of the sgr b2 cloud .    the inferred @xmath0oh column density in the shell , ( 1.52.5)@xmath1310@xmath0 @xmath30 , and that of h@xmath53o determined also from lws / fp data ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1997 ; 2002 , in preparation ) leads to an oh / h@xmath16o=0.11 abundance ratio . for comparison , shock models of flower et al .",
    "predict @xmath12@xmath54 , while models of dense dark cores predict @xmath1210@xmath55 . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximun oh abundance in pdr models is @xmath1210@xmath52 with oh / h@xmath16o ratios close to 10 .",
    "the large abundance found in sgr b2 suggests that its external shells are illuminated by a strong uv field producing a pdr , although low velocity shocks ( v@xmath5630 km @xmath24 ) , unresolved by the iso data , may be also present .",
    "many species formed during the evolution of the cold gas in sgr b2 are being now reprocessed in these regions .",
    "this warm gas is poorly traced by millimeter and submillimeter observations , but it represents the strongest contribution to the absorption / emission features in the far  ir spectrum of sgr b2 .",
    "in addition to @xmath0oh and @xmath1oh , we have searched for several related species such as oh@xmath18 or h@xmath16o@xmath18 .",
    "no lines from these species have been found .",
    "the future far ",
    "ir instruments on board next generation telescopes such as the _ herschel space observatory _ will allow a fast mapping of many oh rotational lines in galactic and extragalactic sources making oh a very useful tool in deriving the physical properties of gc giant molecular clouds .",
    "this could help in the analysis of starburst galaxies like arp 220 .",
