    "similar techniques can be used to estimate other constants associated with the combinatorics of words , e.g. , the asymptotics of ternary square - free words and of binary cube - free words @xcite .",

    "the radius of convergence for the hexagon series @xmath118 possesses an exact expression .",
    "no similar theoretical breakthrough has occurred for the square model , hence the radius of convergence for the square series @xmath119 has no known analogous formula @xcite .",
    "these values are important since they correspond to the critical activity ( e.g. , temperature or density ) at which a phase transition occurs in the model .",
    "if one replaces princes by kings on the chessboard with square cells , then the corresponding constant @xcite is 1.342643951124 .... a related problem , that of enumerating the _ maximal _ configurations of @xmath120 nonattacking kings , was discussed in @xcite , @xcite .",
