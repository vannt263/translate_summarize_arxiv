    "less of a difference was found for @xmath119 , with a larson - like scaling ( @xmath217 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in both models .",
    "introducing scale dependent variables in the multi - component stability analysis leads to a more robust characterization of the level of instability .",
    "the feedback driven model is , on average , stable or marginally stable on all scales , in contrast to the model without feedback , for which we can clearly identify the scales ( @xmath218 ) where gravitational instability , leading to cloud formation , typically occurs .",
    "large scales ( @xmath169 ) show almost identical stability properties in both models , as the surface density and velocity dispersion `` saturate '' into more well - defined , non - turbulent quantities , explaining the similarity between the markedly different ism models when adopting a traditional large scale stability analysis .",
    "4 .   the disc stabilized by stellar feedback can still be , in a statistical sense , well described by a toomre - like @xmath1 stability threshold .",
    "this is no longer true for the violently fragmenting disc , which enters a regime where a @xmath1-like parameter loses its meaning and small scales are asymptotically more and more unstable , and stability can only occur on large scales ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite investigated gravitational fragmentation in turbulent media , arguing that turbulent flows are always unstable on some scale , given enough time , as a broad spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations exists that can produce rare , but gravitationally unstable regions .",
    "this notion is compatible with our results ; by defining the typical densities and velocities existing at some scale in a mass weighted sense , we are biasing ourselves towards dense regions .",
    "this gives us the _ typical _ structures , by mass , that exists in the ism .",
    "however , the scatter in the dispersion relation for the model with feedback - driven turbulence ( fig.[fig : w2 ] ) can be substantial on small scales at any time , due to the wide range of densities in supersonically turbulent flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "current astronomical facilities such as alma can resolve the scaling properties of galactic turbulence in the cold molecular gas of high redshift systems , hence revealing the interplay between gravitational instability and turbulence in more extreme environments .",
    "it is important to consider the limitations and assumptions behind the analysis presented in this work .",
    "the dispersion relation ( eq.[eq : disprel1 ] and [ eq : disprel2 ] ) is formally only describing stability against local axisymmetric perturbations , i.e. it assumes that @xmath219 .",
    "this is the short - wavelength approximation and is satisfied in our work as we only carry out our analysis at @xmath220 , and with @xmath221 this holds on all scales we have considered .",
    "however , the assumption of axisymmetry is not true in general , and nonaxisymmetric perturbations are thought to have a greater destabilizing effect , i.e. discs that are formally stable ( @xmath222 ) can be locally unstable against such perturbations .",
    "local nonaxisymmetric stability criteria are far more complex than toomre s criterion as they depend critically on how tightly wound the perturbations are , and any such criteria can not , in general , be expressed in terms of a single parameter akin to toomre s @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
