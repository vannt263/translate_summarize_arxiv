    "* power - law fit for overall flight . *",
    "first , we fit the flight length distribution of the geolife and nokia mdc datasets regardless of transportation modes ( see methods section ) .",
    "we fit truncated power - law , lognormal , power - law and exponential distribution ( see supplementary table s1 ) .",
    "we find that the overall flight length ( @xmath0 ) distributions fit a truncated power - law @xmath1 with exponent @xmath2 as 1.57 in the geolife dataset ( @xmath3 ) and 1.39 in the nokia mdc dataset ( @xmath4 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) , better than other alternatives such as power - law , lognormal or exponential . figure .",
    "[ fig : all ] illustrates the pdfs and their best fitted distributions according to akaike weights .",
    "the best fitted distribution ( truncated power - law ) is represented as a solid line and the rest are dotted lines .",
    "we use logarithm bins to remove tail noises @xcite .",
    "our result is consistent with previous research ( @xcite ) , and the exponent @xmath2 is close to their results .",
    "we show the akaike weights for all fitted distributions in the supplementary table s2 .",
    "the akaike weight is a value between 0 and 1 .",
    "the larger it is , the better the distribution is fitted @xcite .",
    "the akaike weights of the power - law distributions regardless of transportation modes are 1.0000 in both datasets .",
    "the p - value is less than 0.01 in all our tests , which means that our results are very strong in terms of statistical significance .",
    "note that here the differences between fitted distributions are not remarkable as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] , especially between the truncated power - law and the lognormal distribution .",
    "we use the loglikelihood ratio to further compare these two candidate distributions .",
    "the loglikelihood ratio is positive if the data is more likely in the power - law distribution , and negative if the data is more likely in the lognormal distribution .",
    "the loglikelihood ratio is 1279.98 and 3279.82 ( with the significance value @xmath5 ) in the geolife and the nokiamdc datasets respectively , indicating that the data is much better fitted with the truncated power - law distribution .",
    "* lognormal fit for single transportation mode .",
    "* however , the distribution of flight lengths in each single transportation mode is not well fitted with the power - law distribution . instead ,",
    "they are better fitted with the lognormal distribution ( see supplementary table s2 ) .",
    "all the segments of each transportation flight length are best approximated by the lognormal distribution with different parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : geolife ] and supplementary fig .",
    "s1 , we represent the flight length distributions of walk / run , bike , subway / train and car / taxi / bus in the geolife and the nokia mdc dataset correspondingly . the best fitted distribution ( lognormal )",
    "is represented as a solid line and the rest are dotted lines .",
    "table [ tab : parameters ] shows the fitted parameter for all the distributions ( @xmath2 in the truncated power - law , @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the lognormal ) .",
    "we can easily find that the @xmath6 is increasing over these transportation modes ( walk / run , bike , car / taxi / bus and subway / train ) , identifying an increasing average distance . compared to walk / run , bike or car / taxi / bus ,",
    "the flight distribution in subway / train mode is more right - skewed , which means that people usually travel to a more distant location by subway / train .",
    "it must be noted that our findings for the car / taxi / bus mode are different from these recent research results @xcite , which also investigated the case of a single transportation mode , and found that the scaling of human mobility is exponential by examining taxi gps datasets .",
    "the differences are mainly because few people tend to travel a long distance by taxi due to economic considerations .",
    "so the displacements in their results decay faster than those measured in our car / taxi / bus mode cases .",
    "* mechanisms behind the power - law pattern . *",
    "we characterize the mechanism of the power - law pattern with lvy flights by mixing the lognormal distributions of the transportation modes .",
    "previous research has shown that a mixture of lognormal distributions based on an exponential distribution is a power - law distribution @xcite .",
    "based on their findings , we demonstrate that the reason that human movement follows the lvy walk pattern is due to the mixture of the transportation modes they take .",
    "we demonstrate that the mixture of the lognormal distributions of different transportation modes ( walk / run , bike , train / subway or car / taxi / bus ) is a power - law distribution given two new findings : first , we define the change rate as the relative change of length between two consecutive flights with the same transport mode .",
    "the change rate in the same transportation mode is small over time .",
    "second , the elapsed time between different transportation modes is exponentially distributed .    *",
    "lognormal in the same transportation mode .",
    "* let us consider a generic flight @xmath8 .",
    "the flight length at next interval of time @xmath9 , given the change rate @xmath10 , is @xmath11    it has been found that the change rate @xmath12 in the same transportation mode is small over time @xcite .",
    "the change rate @xmath12 reflects the correlation between two consecutive displacements in one trip . to obtain the pattern of correlation between consecutive displacements in each transportation mode",
    ", we plot the flight length point ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) from the geolife dataset ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] ) . here",
    "@xmath8 represents the @xmath13-th flight length and @xmath9 represents the @xmath14-th flight length in a consecutive trajectory in one transportation mode @xcite . figure .",
    "[ fig : rate ] shows the density of flight lengths correlation in car / taxi / bus , walk / run , subway / train and bike correspondingly .",
    "( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) are posited near the diagonal line , which identifies a clear positive correlation .",
    "similar results are also found in the nokia mdc dataset ( see supplementary fig .",
    "we use the pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the strength of the correlation between two consecutive flights in one transportation mode @xcite .",
    "the value of pearson correlation coefficient @xmath15 is shown in the supplementary table s3 .",
    "the @xmath16 value is less than 0.01 in all the cases , identifying very strong statistical significances .",
    "@xmath15 is positive in each transportation mode and ranges from 0.3640 to 0.6445 , which means that there is a significant positive correlation between consecutive flights in the same transportation mode , and the change rate @xmath12 in the same transportation mode between two time steps is small .",
    "the difference @xmath12 in the same transportation mode between two time steps is small due to a small difference @xmath17 in consecutive flights .",
    "we sum all the contributions as follows :    @xmath18    we plot the change rate samples @xmath12 of the car / taxi / bus mode from the geolife dataset as an example in supplementary fig .",
    "we observe that the change rate @xmath12 fluctuates in an uncorrelated fashion from one time interval to the other in one transportation mode due to the unpredictable character of the change rate .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient accepts the findings at the 0.03 - 0.13 level with p - value less than 0.05 ( see supplementary table s4 ) . by the central limit theorem ,",
    "the sum of the change rate @xmath12 is normally distributed with the mean @xmath19 and the variance @xmath20 , where @xmath6 and @xmath21 are the mean and variance of the change rate @xmath12 and @xmath22 is the elapsed time .",
    "then we can assert that for every time step @xmath13 , the logarithm of @xmath0 is also normally distributed with a mean @xmath23 and variance @xmath24 @xcite . note here that @xmath25 is the length of the flight at the time @xmath22 after @xmath22 intervals of elapsed time . in the same transportation mode ,",
    "the distribution of the flight length with the same change rate mean is lognormal , its density is given by @xmath26,\\ ] ] which corresponds to our findings that in each single transportation mode the flight length is lognormal distributed .    *",
    "transportation mode elapsed time .",
    "* we define elapsed time as the time spent in a particular transportation mode ; we found that it is exponentially distributed .",
    "for example , the trajectory samples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory ] contain six trajectories with three different transportation modes , ( taxi , walk , subway , walk , taxi , walk ) .",
    "thus the elapsed time also consists of six samples ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the elapsed time @xmath13 is weighted exponentially between the different transportation modes ( see supplementary fig .",
    "similar results are also reported in @xcite .",
    "the exponentially weighted time interval is mainly due to a large portion of walk / run flight intervals .",
    "walk / run is usually a connecting mode between different transportation modes ( e.g. , the trajectory samples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory ] ) , and walk / run usually takes much shorter time than any other modes .",
    "thus the elapsed time decays exponentially .",
    "for example , 87.93@xmath33 of the walk distance connecting other transportation modes is within 500 meters and the travelling time is within 5 minutes in the geolife dataset .    *",
    "mixture of the transportation modes .",
    "* given these lognormal distributions @xmath34 in each transportation mode and the exponential elapsed time @xmath13 between different modes , we make use of mixtures of distributions . we obtain the overall human mobility probability by considering that the distribution of flight length is determined by the time @xmath13 , the transportation mode change rate @xmath12 mean @xmath6 and variance @xmath21 .",
    "we obtain the distribution of single transportation mode distribution with the time @xmath13 , the change rate mean @xmath6 and variance @xmath21 fixed .",
    "we then compute the mixture over the distribution of @xmath13 since @xmath13 is exponentially distributed over different transportation modes with an exponential parameter @xmath35 .",
    "if the distribution of @xmath0 , @xmath36 , depends on the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath13 is also distributed according to its own distribution @xmath37 .",
    "then the distribution of @xmath0 , @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 . here",
    "the @xmath13 in @xmath36 is the same as the @xmath13 in the @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath37 is the exponential distribution of elapsed time @xmath13 with an exponential parameter @xmath35 .",
    "so the mixture ( overall flight length @xmath40 ) of these lognormal distributions in one transportation mode given an exponential elapsed time ( with an exponent @xmath35 ) between each transportation mode is @xmath41 d t , \\ ] ] which can be calculated to give @xmath42    where the power law exponent @xmath43 is determined by @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the calculation to obtain @xmath43 is given in supplementary note 1 .",
    "if we substitute the parameters presented in table [ tab : parameters ] , we will get the @xmath45 in the geolife dataset , which is close to the original parameter @xmath46 , and @xmath47 in the nokia mdc dataset , which is close to the original parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the result verifies that the mixture of these correlated lognormal distributed flights in one transportation mode given an exponential elapsed time between different modes is a truncated power - law distribution .",
    "previous research suggests that it might be the underlying road network that governs the lvy flight human mobility , by exploring the human mobility and examining taxi traces in one city in sweden @xcite . to verify their hypothesis",
    ", we use a road network dataset of beijing containing 433,391 roads with 171,504 conjunctions and plot the road length distribution @xcite . as shown in supplementary fig .",
    "s5 , the road length distribution is very different to our power - law fit in flights distribution regardless of transportation modes .",
    "the @xmath2 in road length distribution is 3.4 , much larger than our previous findings @xmath46 in the geolife and @xmath48 in the nokia mdc .",
    "thus the underlying street network can not fully explain the lvy flight in human mobility .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that it does not consider many long flights caused by metro or train , and people do not always turn even if they arrive at a conjunction of a road .",
    "thus the flight length tails in the human mobility should be much larger than those in the road networks .",
    "* data sets . *",
    "we use two large real - life gps trajectory datasets in our work , the geolife dataset @xcite and the nokia mdc dataset @xcite . the key information provided by these two datasets is summarized in table [ tab : mobilitydataset ] .",

    "there is a label file storing the transportation mode labels in each user s folder , from which we can obtain the ground truth transportation mode each user is taking and the corresponding timestamps .",
    "similar to the geolife dataset , there is also a file storing the transportation mode with an activity i d in the nokia mdc dataset .",

    "we recompute a position by averaging samples ( latitude , longitude ) every minute .",
    "since people do not necessarily move in perfect straight lines , we need to allow some margin of error in defining the ` straight ' line .",
    "we use a rectangular model to simplify the trajectory and obtain the flight length : when we draw a straight line between the first point and the last point , the sampled positions between these two endpoints are at a distance less than 10 meters from the line .",
