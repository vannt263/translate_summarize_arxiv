    "the determination of large scale distances and hence the calibration of the hubble constant @xmath0 has been fundamentally influenced by the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "for the first time this extremely powerful instrument has made accessible a simple , reliable , and clear - cut method to reach into the _ cosmic _ expansion field by calibrating the luminosity of type ia supernovae ( sneia )  the best standard candles known  through cepheid distances of their nearest representatives .",
    "the dominant rle of cepheids on this route to @xmath0 has presumably prompted the organizers of this colloquium to ask for a status report on the ( distant ) distance scale .",
    "the cepheid surveys to be reported here extend only tiny angles in the sky , but they comprise large parts of or even entire galaxies and in this sense may also justify the colloquium s emphasis on `` large - scale surveys '' .",
    "in section  2 we discuss cepheids as distance indicators and quote the cepheid distances of eight galaxies which have produced nine sneia .",
    "the cepheid - calibrated sneia luminosities are given in section  3 . in section  4",
    "we discuss the hubble diagram of an objective sample of blue sneia and homogenize the sneia as to decline rate @xmath3 and colour @xmath4 .",
    "the data in sections  3 and 4 are combined in section  5 to derive the large - scale value of @xmath0 .",
    "the result is compared with external evidence in section  6 .",
    "some conclusions follow in section  7 .",
    "cepheids are presently , through their period - luminosity ( pl ) relation , the most reliable and least controversial distance indicators .",
    "the slope and the zeropoint of the pl relation is taken from the very well observed cepheids in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , whose distance modulus is adopted to be @xmath5 ( madore & freedman 1991 ) .    an old pl relation calibrated by galactic cepheids in open clusters , and now vindicated by hipparcos data ( sandage & tammann 1998 ) , gave @xmath6 ( sandage & tammann 1968 , 1971 ) .",
    "hipparcos data combined with more modern cepheid data give an even somewhat higher modulus ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) . reviews of cepheid distances ( federspiel , tammann , & sandage 1998 ; gratton 1998 ; feast 1999 ; walker 1999a ) cluster around @xmath7 ,  a value in perfect agreement with the purely geometrical distance determination of sn1987a ( @xmath8 ; gilmozzi & panagia 1999 ; sonneborn et  al .",

    "lyr stars gratton ( 1998 ) concludes that @xmath9 .",
    "a general problem of distance determinations is that distance indicators are occasionally used which have never been demonstrated to be useful and reliable .",
    "their application relies on the _ assumption _ of uniformity .",
    "examples are statistical parallaxes of galactic rr  lyr stars , which are sensitive to the sample selection ( walker 1999b ) , and red - giant clump stars , whose luminosity is expected to be metal- and age - dependent ( chaboyer 1999 ) .",
    "these untested methods yield typically small lmc distances and have led to what has recently been termed the `` short distance scale '' .",
    "the corresponding lmc distances carry low weight .",
    "there has been much debate about the possibility that the pl relation of cepheids depends on metallicity .",
    "the question here is more of principal than of practical importance because the _ mean _ metallicity of the seven spiral galaxies and one am galaxy considered below hardly differs by much from the galactic metallicity .",
    "evidence for a ( very ) _ weak _ metallicity dependence comes from the fact that the metal - rich galactic cepheids give perfectly reasonable distances for both the moderately metal - poor lmc cepheids and the really metal - poor smc cepheids and , still more importantly , that their relative distances are wavelength - independent ( di benedetto 1997 ; cf .",
    "tammann 1997 ) .",
    " much progress has been made on the theoretical front .",
    "saio & gautschy ( 1998 ) and baraffe et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) have evolved cepheids through the different crossings of the instability strip and have investigated the pulsational behavior at any point .",
    "the resulting ( highly metal - insensitive ) pl relations in bolometric light have been transformed into pl relations at different wavelengths by means of detailed atmospheric models ; the conclusion is that any metallicity dependence of the pl relations is negligible ( sandage , bell , & tripicco 1998 ; alibert et  al .",
    "1999 ; cf . however bono , marconi , & stellingwerf 1998 , who strongly depend on the treatment of stellar convection ) .    while remaining uncertainties of the pl relation and the zeropoint seem to have only minor practical consequences , the application to _ hst _ observations",
    "is by no means simple .",
    "the photometric zeropoint , the linearity over the field , crowding , and cosmic rays raise technical problems .",
    "the quality of the derived distances depends further on ( variable ) internal absorption and the number of available cepheids in view of the finite width of the instability strip .",
    "( an attempt to beat the latter problem by using a pl - color relation is invalid because the underlying assumption of constant slope of the constant - period lines is unjustified ; cf .",

    "typical errors of individual cepheid distances from are therefore @xmath10mag ( 10% in distance ) . for four of the nine sneia in table  1",
    "the resulting errors in luminosity are smaller , because they suffer closely the same ( small ) absorption as `` their '' cepheids , such that only apparent distance moduli are needed .",
    "the nine sneia in the eight galaxies with known cepheid distances from _ hst _ are listed in table  1 .",
    "six galaxies are from the `` _ hst _ sneia calibration program for the hubble constant '' ; two additional ones are taken from the literature .",

    "kennicutt , mould , & freedman ( 1998 ) , and freedman ( 1999 ) have discarded several of the calibrators in table  1 and added two that are not based on direct cepheid distances to the host galaxy .",
    "they have consequently derived a fainter mean absolute @xmath25 magnitude than in table  1 .",
    "specifically , they assume that the distance of the early - type galaxies ngc1316 and ngc1380 in the fornax cluster , parent galaxies of sn1980n and sn1992a , are identical with that of the spiral ngc1365 for which a cepheid distance is available .",

    "this has become untenable .",
    "the project for the luminosity calibration of sneia will be continued .",

    "all sneia are corrected for galactic absorption ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) .",

    ". only seven sneia of the sample have @xmath41 .",
    "they are underluminous judging from their velocity distance , and five of them lie close to the centre of their parent spiral galaxies .",
    "their redness is probably due to internal absorption .",
    "they are left out in the following .",
    "had they been retained in on the assumption that their color is intrinsic , the derived value of @xmath0 would become somewhat _",
    "lower_. if they were retained and corrected for standard absorption they would have an unnoticeable effect on @xmath0 as derived below .",
    "the remaining sample of 36 sneia has a small range in color of @xmath42 and a mean color of @xmath43 .",
    "the mean color of the sneia in e / s0 galaxies , of the outlying sneia in spirals , and of the calibrators in table  1  which are expected to suffer minimum internal absorption or are corrected for absorption  is @xmath44 .",
    "the close agreement of these two mean colors is a convincing demonstration that the sample of 36 sneia is essentially free of internal absorption .",
    "this is not surprising because unreddened sneia have at large distances a considerably higher discovery chance .",
    "the 36 sneia define tight hubble diagrams in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the scatter is only @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively .    blue sneia at maximum phase",
    "still show some variation in temperature , spectrum , and presumably ni mass .",
    "it is hence indicated to ask whether these parameters correlate with luminosity .",
    "however , data on the relevant parameters are too sparse to establish a firm relation .",
    "instead it is reasonable to seek for empirical correlations between luminosity and directly observable `` second parameters '' like decline rate @xmath3 ( i.e. the luminosity decrease in @xmath25 magnitudes within 15 days after @xmath25 maximum ) , sn colour , hubble type of the parent galaxy , and radial distance from the centre of the parent galaxy .",
    "in fact a luminosity dependence on @xmath3 , sn color @xmath4 , and hubble type @xmath48 does exist .",
    "however , an increase of the luminosity scatter with decreasing galactocentric distance ( wang , hflich , & wheeler 1997 ) is not confirmed by blue sneia .    to obtain quantitative relations between the maximum magnitudes and any of the second parameters , one must correlate the residua ( read in magnitude ) from the mean hubble line with slope 0.2 with @xmath49 , @xmath4 , and @xmath48 .",
    "however , there are strong reasons to believe that the residua of sneia inside @xmath50 are not only caused by luminosity variations , but also by deviation from a pure hubble flow .",
    "if only the sneia with @xmath51 are considered one finds @xmath52 when these equations are applied to the 36 sneia of the sample one obtains homogenized magnitudes @xmath53 as if all sneia had @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the second parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are nearly orthogonal to each other , but the corrected magnitudes show no remaining dependence on hubble type @xmath48 .",
    "( sneia in e / s0 galaxies are on average fainter than those in spirals , but they are also faster decliners ) .",
    "the 36 corrected sneia define hubble diagrams in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "a fit to the sneia with @xmath51 gives : @xmath56    the scatter in magnitude of @xmath57 is now impressively small , in fact it could be caused entirely by observational error .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity scatter of homogenized sneia is therefore below the present detection limit .",
    "the scatter of the nearer sneia with @xmath58 is somewhat larger , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "this must be due to peculiar motions in the order of @xmath60 , which is most reasonable considering our local motion of @xmath61 with respect to the cmb .",
    "there is also a suggestion of the nearer sneia to lie somewhat above the mean hubble line , which seems to suggest a slightly higher local value of @xmath0 ( see below ) .",
    "simple transformation of equations  ( 4@xmath626 ) leads to @xmath63    here only the absolute magnitudes @xmath64 of the calibrators in table  1 must be inserted to obtain @xmath0 .",
    "but the calibrators must also be corrected by equations ( 1@xmath623 ) , giving @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . inserting these values into equations ( 7@xmath629 ) yields @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the weighted mean of these three values is @xmath71 the external errors will be discussed in section  6 .",
    "had we not corrected the sample of distant sneia and the calibrators by equations ( 1@xmath623 ) , the result would have been @xmath72 .",
    "the reason for the lower value is that the calibrators must have cepheids in their parent galaxies , which hence are of late type , and sneia in late - type galaxies are brighter ( and have lower @xmath3 ) than their counterparts in e / s0 s .",
    "the corrections for the decline rate have sometimes been exaggerated in the past ( phillips 1993 ; hamuy et  al .",
    "1996 ; suntzeff et  al .  1999 ; gibson et  al .",
    "1999 ) leading to larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "however these larger decline rate corrections rest on absolute magnitudes from unreliable distance indicators or on residuals from the hubble line where peculiar motions are still not negligible .",
    "the corrections in equations  ( 1@xmath623 ) , based only on distant sneia with @xmath51 remove all luminosity dependence of the sneia on @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "any larger @xmath3 corrections would introduce a luminosity dependence of opposite sign .",
    "it may be noted that the coefficients of the colour term in equations ( @xmath73 ) are significantly smaller than the ones expected from a standard absorption / reddening ratio .",
    "it is therefore likely that the dependence of luminosity on colour is due to an intrinsic effect .",
    "the colour corrections decrease significantly the scatter about the hubble line .",
    "they do not influence , however , the value of @xmath0 because the calibrators and the 36 sample sneia have closely the same colour .",
    "the value of @xmath0 in equation(10 ) holds only for sneia with @xmath51 , i.e. over very large scales .",
    "the 17 sneia with @xmath74 give instead a mean value of @xmath75 , suggesting a local , yet rather large volume of lower mean density and with a slight overexpansion rate of @xmath76 ( tammann 1998a ; zehavi et  al .",
    "1998 ) . combining the evidence from @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and",
    "@xmath27 it is at present a 2@xmath623@xmath77 effect .",
    "newly discovered sneia will improve on the variance of the expansion field .",
    "the available space does not allow a thorough comparison of @xmath0 in equation  10 with independent evidence .",
    "therefore only an overview of other distance scales , leading mainly through the virgo cluster , is given in fig .",
    "the reader finds a more detailed discussion in tammann , sandage , & reindl ( 1999 ) .",
    "a compilation of present results of physical methods , i.e. the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , gravitational lenses , and cmb fluctuations , can be found in , e.g. , tammann ( 1999 ; see also lasenby et  al .",

    "the 17 galaxies with known cepheid distances outside the local group and outside the virgo cluster yield @xmath85 . but reaching out to barely @xmath86 this value has no cosmological significance .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to extend the distance scale .    by far",
    "the most reliable way to extend the distance scale is by sneia which are , after standardisation as to decline rate and color , unparalleled standard candles .",
    "the number of cepheid - calibrated and distant sneia out to @xmath1 is now sufficiently large to make the statistical error of @xmath0 negligible ( cf .",
    "equation  7 ) .",
    "sources of systematic errors are : ( 1 ) the adopted zeropoint of @xmath11 , a value which is likely to be too small by @xmath87 .",
    "this will reduce @xmath0 by @xmath88 .",
    "( 2 ) the selection effect against faint cepheids at the detection limit ( sandage 1988 ) may systematically underestimetethe distances in table  1 by @xmath89 with a corresponding reduction of @xmath0 .",
    "( 3 ) remaining small metallicity effects of the p - l relation will probably not change the calibration by more than @xmath90 ( 3% ) .",
    "( 4 ) the coefficients of the @xmath3-term in equations ( 1@xmath623 ) carry a statistical error of 0.2 ; increasing ( decreasing ) the coefficients by so much increases ( decreases ) @xmath0 by 2.7 units ( 5% ) .",
    "( 5 ) the nearly perfect agreement of the mean color of the calibrators and the obviously unreddened sneia on the one hand and the remaining distant sneia on the other hand ( cf .",
    "section  4 ) make it improbable that the latter still carry an unaccounted mean reddening of more than @xmath91 ; about half of the corresponding absorption is automatically corrected for by the color term in equations ( 1@xmath623 ) ; the other half can increase @xmath0 by 2% at most .",
