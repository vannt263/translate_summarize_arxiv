    "in this paper , we study problems connected with the renormalized electron mass in a model of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) with nonrelativistic matter .",
    "we are interested in rigorously controlling radiative corrections to the electron mass caused by the interaction of the electron with the _ soft _ modes of the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "the model describing interactions between nonrelativistic , quantum - mechanical charged matter and the quantized radiation field at low energies ( i.e. , energies smaller than the rest energy of an electron ) is the `` standard model '' , see @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider a system consisting of a single spinless electron , described as a nonrelativistic particle that is minimally coupled to the quantized radiation field , and photons .",
    "electron spin can easily be included in our description without substantial complications .",
    "+ the physical system studied in this paper exhibits space translations invariance .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath4 , generating the time evolution , commutes with the vector operator , @xmath1 , representing the total momentum of the system , which generates space translations .",
    "if an infrared regularization , e.g. , an infrared cutoff @xmath5 on the photon frequency , is imposed on the interaction hamiltonian , there exist single - electron or dressed one - electron states , as long as their momentum is smaller than the bare electron mass , @xmath6 , of the electron .",
    "this means that a notion of mass shell in the energy momentum spectrum is meaningful for velocities @xmath7 smaller than the speed of light @xmath8 ; ( with @xmath9 in our units ) .",
    "vectors @xmath10 describing dressed one - electron states are normalizable vectors in the hilbert space @xmath11 of pure states of the system .",
    "they are characterized as solutions of the equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian with an infrared cutoff @xmath5 in the interaction term and @xmath14 , the energy of a dressed electron , is a function of the momentum operator @xmath1 .",
    "if in the joint spectrum of the components of @xmath1 the support of the vector @xmath15 is contained in a ball centered at the origin and of radius less than @xmath16 then eq . ( [ eq : i.1 ] ) has solutions ; see @xcite . since @xmath17=0 $ ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : i.1 ] ) can be studied for the fiber vectors , @xmath18 , corresponding to a value , @xmath1 , of the total momentum ; ( both the total momentum operator and points in its spectrum will henceforth be denoted by @xmath1  without danger of confusion ) .",
    "thus we consider the equation    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the fiber hamiltonian at fixed total momentum @xmath1 , and @xmath21 is the value of the function @xmath22 at the point @xmath23 .",

    "the procedure presented in our paper relies on _ iterative analytic perturbation theory _ ( see section [ sectii ] where this tool is recalled ) that makes our proof substantially different and much shorter in comparison to a renormalization group approach .",
    "the main feature is a more transparent treatment of the so called _ marginal _ terms of the interaction , where an essential role is played by explicit bogoliubov transformations that transform the infrared representations of the ccr of photon creation- and annihilation operators determined by dressed one - particle states of fixed momentum @xmath41 back to the fock representation .",
    "the use of these bogoliubov transformations is a crucial device in our fight against the infrared problem .",
    "the way in which we are using them is new , at least in the context of mathematically rigorous results on the infrared problem in qed .    in our paper , the regularity properties of @xmath0 come with an explicit control of the asymptotics of the fiber ground state eigenvectors @xmath42 as @xmath5 tends to zero .",
    "( this improves earlier results in @xcite . ) along the lines of @xcite , these results are preparatory to developing an infrared finite algorithm for the asymptotic expansion of the renormalized electron mass in powers and , probably , logarithms of the finestructure constant @xmath32 , up to an arbitrarily small remainder term .",
