    "it also is the shelling basis for a certain el - shelling of the partition lattice given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) .",
    "this basis has connections to the free lie algebra as well ; see @xcite .",
    "we now give a brief description of the splitting basis of @xcite . for each @xmath13 , let @xmath14 be the subposet of @xmath10 consisting of partitions obtained by splitting @xmath15 . in figure 1 the subposet @xmath16 of @xmath17 is shown .",
    "each poset @xmath14 is isomorphic to the face lattice of an @xmath18-dimensional simplex .",
    "therefore @xmath19 , the order complex of the proper part of @xmath14 , is an @xmath20-sphere embedded in @xmath21 , and hence it determines a fundamental cycle @xmath22 . in @xcite it is shown that a certain subset of @xmath23 forms a basis for @xmath24 ; namely , the set of all @xmath25 such that @xmath15 fixes @xmath26 .",
    "the partition lattice is the intersection lattice of the type @xmath0 coxeter arrangement . the original motivation for this paper was to explain and generalize to other coxeter groups , the splitting basis for @xmath10 .",
    "taking a geometric point of view we give such an explanation , which then leads to the construction of `` splitting bases '' also for the intersection lattices of coxeter arrangements of types @xmath1 and @xmath2 and of some interpolating arrangements .",
    "our technique is general in that it gives a way to construct a basis for the homology of the intersection lattice of any real hyperplane arrangement .",
    "the intersection lattice of the type @xmath1 coxeter arrangement is isomorphic to the signed partition lattice @xmath27 .",
    "its elements are signed partitions of @xmath28 ; that is partitions of @xmath28 in which any element but the smallest element of each nonzero block can be barred . for each element @xmath15 of the hyperoctahedral group @xmath29",
    ", we form a subposet @xmath14 of @xmath27 consisting of all signed partitions obtained by splitting the signed permutation @xmath15 . in figure 2 the subposet @xmath30 of @xmath31",
    "just as for type @xmath0 , it is clear that each subposet @xmath14 determines a fundamental cycle @xmath25 in @xmath32 .",
    "it is not clear , however , that the elements @xmath25 , @xmath33 , generate @xmath34 ; nor is it clear how one would select cycles @xmath25 that form a basis for @xmath34 .",
    "our geometric technique enables us to identify a basis whose elements are those @xmath25 for which the right - to - left maxima of @xmath15 are unbarred",
    ".        we will now give a somewhat more detailed description of the content of the paper . the proper setting for our discussion",
    "is that of real hyperplane arrangements , or ( even more generally ) oriented matroids .",
    "let @xmath3 be an arrangement of linear hyperplanes in @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is essential , meaning that @xmath35 . the intersection lattice @xmath36 is the family of intersections of subarrangements @xmath37 , ordered by reverse inclusion .",
    "it is a geometric lattice , so it is known from a theorem of folkman @xcite that @xmath38 and @xmath39 for all @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , the order complex @xmath42 has the homotopy type of a wedge of @xmath43-spheres .",
    "there are many copies of the boolean lattice @xmath44}$ ] ( or equivalently , the face lattice of the @xmath45-simplex ) embedded in every geometric lattice of length @xmath46 .",
    "each such boolean subposet determines a fundamental cycle in homology . in @xcite bjrner",
    "gives a combinatorial method for constructing homology bases using such boolean cycles .",
    "this method , which in its simplest version is based on the so called `` broken circuit '' construction from matroid theory , is applicable to _ all _ geometric lattices ( not only to intersection lattices of hyperplane arrangements ) .",
    "although the cycles in the splitting basis are boolean , the basis does not arise from the broken circuit construction .",
    "it turns out that the splitting basis does arise from the geometric construction in this paper .",
    "there is a natural way to associate polytopal cycles in the intersection lattice @xmath47 with regions of the arrangement @xmath48 .",
    "these cycles are not necessarily boolean .",
    "they are fundamental cycles determined by face lattices of convex @xmath45-polytopes embedded in @xmath47 .",
    "we show that these cycles generate the homology of @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , we present a way of identifying those regions whose corresponding cycles form a basis . here is a short and non - technical statement of the method .",
    "let @xmath50 be an affine hyperplane in @xmath4 which is generic with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "the induced affine arrangement @xmath51 in @xmath52 will have certain regions that are bounded .",
    "each bounded region @xmath53 is a convex @xmath45-polytope in @xmath50 and it is easy to see that a copy of its face lattice sits embedded in @xmath36 .",
    "briefly , every face @xmath54 of @xmath53 is the intersection of the maximal faces containing it , and so @xmath54 can be mapped to the intersection of the linear spans ( in @xmath4 ) of these maximal faces , which is an element of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , we have a cycle @xmath55 for each bounded region @xmath53 . a main result ( theorem  [ t2 ] )",
    "is that these cycles @xmath56 , indexed by the bounded regions of @xmath57 , form a basis for @xmath58 .",
    "the regions of a coxeter arrangement are simplicial cones that correspond bijectively to the elements of the coxeter group . when the geometric method is applied to the intersection lattice of any coxeter arrangement , the cycles in the resulting basis are boolean and are indexed by the elements of the coxeter group that correspond to the bounded regions of a generic affine slice . for type a , when the generic affine hyperplane @xmath50 is chosen appropriately one gets the splitting basis consisting of cycles @xmath25 indexed by the permutations @xmath15 that fix @xmath26 . in figure 3 the intersection of the coxeter arrangement @xmath59 with @xmath50",
    "the bounded regions are labeled by their corresponding permutation .        for type b , when the generic affine hyperplane @xmath50 is chosen appropriately , one gets the type @xmath1 splitting basis consisting of cycles @xmath25 indexed by signed permutations @xmath15 whose right - to - left maxima are unbarred .",
    "the hyperplane arrangement @xmath60 intersected with a cube is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the regions that have bounded intersection with @xmath50 are the ones that are labeled .",
    "the labels are the signed permutations whose right - to - left maxima are unbarred .",
    "all arguments in the paper are combinatorial in nature , which means that they can be carried out for oriented matroids",
    ". so the construction of bases is applicable to geometric lattices of orientable matroids .",
    "geometrically this means that we can allow some topological deformation of the hyperplane arrangements .",
    "major parts of this work ( sections  [ affine ] , [ cent ] and  [ braid ] ) were carried out at the hebrew university in 1993 during the jerusalem combinatorics conference .",
    "the rest was added in 1998 .",
    "it has been brought to our attention that some of the material in sections  [ affine ] and  [ cent ] shows similarities with work of others ( see e.g. proposition 5.6 of damon @xcite and parts of ziegler @xcite , @xcite ) ; however , there is no substantial overlap or direct duplication .",
