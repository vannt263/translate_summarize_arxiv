    "elastic pion - pion scattering has been an object of study for many decades due to several reasons . in particular",
    ", pions are very relevant in the description of final states in other hadronic processes .",
    "also , the two pion correlated exchange in the scalar - isoscalar channel is the main contribution to nucleon - nucleon attraction , and has been interpreted for long as a scalar `` sigma '' resonance @xcite , whose existence , mass and width have been the subject of an intense debate .",
    "actually this resonance , nowadays called @xmath1 , appears as a pole deep in the second riemann sheet of the scattering amplitude ( see the `` note on scalar mesons '' in @xcite for a detailed account ) .",
    "finally , the pion - pion interaction at low energies is also relevant for the determination of light quark mass ratios and the size of the chiral condensate @xcite .    on the theory side , unfortunately , neither the elastic resonance region nor the low energy region are accessible to perturbative qcd calculations . in order to describe these processes in terms of quarks and gluons",
    "one should rely on lattice techniques . for a long time",
    ", these techniques have found little applications in this low - energy realm due to complications on the implementation of chiral symmetry , the small physical values of the light quarks and other technicalities as the existence of quark - line disconnected diagrams in some channels .",
    "however , very recently , lattice results have become available for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 resonance masses @xcite , the pion decay constant @xcite or even the isospin 2 scattering length @xcite , obtained with pion masses which are not too far from the physical values .",
    "recent developments @xcite in algorithms may make disconnected diagrams for multi - hadron calculations tractable in the not too distant future .",
    "this means that pion - pion scattering phase shifts might be calculable soon within lattice",
    "qcd . actually , some first results for the isospin 2 waves have been obtained for still somewhat large pion masses @xcite .",
    "of course , lattice calculations still have systematic uncertainties which are hard to estimate and they always rely on modified actions , finite volumes , and other complications so that their physical results are actually extrapolations to the physical limit .",
    "it is therefore necessary to understand how these chiral or physical extrapolations should be carried out .    fortunately ,",
    "even though we can not rely on perturbative qcd at low energies , we can still use its effective low energy theory , known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , which provides a rigorous , systematic and model independent expansion of hadronic observables in terms of the external meson momenta and the relatively small pion mass .",
    "we will very briefly review chpt in section  [ sec : chpt ] , mostly to introduce the required notation .    within chpt",
    ", the quark mass dependence appears in a model independent way through the pion mass squared , which is also described as an expansion . remarkably , the isospin @xmath3 scattering length @xmath4 dependence found on the lattice is rather well described by just leading order chpt up to surprisingly large pion masses @xcite and the one - loop corrections seem to be rather small . in this work we will first study the evolution of the lowest five pion - pion scattering phase shifts , with definite isospin and angular momentum @xmath5 and @xmath6 , using the one and two - loop standard chpt expressions , estimating the uncertainties due to the relatively poor knowledge of the low energy constants  particularly those at two loops .",
    "of course , this approach is limited to low masses and momenta and can not be used to describe resonances , although , in principle it should be able to describe their low energy tails , through , for instance , the low energy scattering phase shifts .",
    "this is the reason why one of the aims of this work is to study the evolution of all @xmath7 scattering phase shifts at low energy within standard chpt .    beyond the low energy regime ,",
    "it is still possible to obtain the quark mass dependence of hadronic observables , by combining chpt with dispersion relations .",
    "thus , in section [ sec : iam ] we briefly review the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite , obtained by using the elastic approximation together with chpt , to calculate the subtraction constants and the left cut contribution of a dispersion relation for the inverse of the partial waves .",
    "this technique provides a description of meson - meson scattering which is simultaneously compatible with the chpt low energy description but also generates the lightest elastic resonance on each channel . by applying this technique to the @xmath7 scattering amplitude to one - loop in su(2 ) chpt ,",
    "some of us have calculated the pion mass dependence of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 masses and widths @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this method had already been applied to study only the @xmath1 quark mass dependence and its influence , through the nucleon - nucleon interaction , on the production of carbon and oxygen and its anthropic implications @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , some of us have also calculated the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mass and width dependence with respect to the non strange - quark mass , as well as the dependence of all these four resonances with respect to the strange quark mass .",
    "and even more recently @xcite we have extended to too loops the analysis of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 resonances within unitarized elastic @xmath7 scattering .",
    "the iam results for the @xmath4 dependence of the @xmath2 agree nicely with the estimations for the two first coefficients of its chiral expansion @xcite , and also with the existing lattice results @xcite .",
    "the comparison with lattice is relatively straightforward in this case since the @xmath2 is not extremely wide and it is actually calculated as a state of the spectrum",
    ".    unfortunately , the comparison of the iam with lattice results will not be so straightforward for the scalar channels .",
    "first , we find of particular interest the repulsive @xmath3 channels .",
    "note that these channels have no resonances , so that neither the spectroscopic studies on the lattice nor our pole studies with the iam @xcite address this case . however , this is the simplest channel for scattering lattice studies and , as commented above , there are already some lattice results for the scattering length down to relatively low pion masses @xcite and for phase - shifts but only for @xmath10 mev or higher @xcite .",
    "second , we are also interested in the much debated isoscalar channel . of course ,",
    "given the status of the @xmath11 or @xmath1 , reliable lattice results would be most welcome .",
    "unfortunately lattice calculations in this channel are hard due to disconnected diagrams , but also their interpretation would be complicated because this resonance is extremely wide ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , it was shown in @xcite that , for sufficiently high masses , the @xmath1 , being a scalar , becomes a virtual state  a pole in the second riemann sheet below threshold  which is not a physical state of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , since spectroscopic ( or `` pole '' ) lattice studies of the @xmath11 may be rather complicated , a study of the scalar phase shift , as the one presented here , deserves more interest .",
    "these are the motivations to study the chiral extrapolation of phase shifts either from standard or unitarized chpt .",
    "this will be done first for standard chpt to next to leading order ( nlo ) in section  [ sec : resultsnlochpt ] and then to next to next to leading order ( nnlo ) in section  [ sec : resultsnnlochpt ] .",
    "surprisingly , in both cases , the predicted behavior for the phase shift in the @xmath2 may look counterintuitive when compared with present lattice calculations of the @xmath2 mass @xmath4 dependence",
    ". this discussion deserves a separated section , in which we also evaluate the pion mass dependence of the `` size '' of the @xmath2 .",
    "next we will present the iam results for nlo chpt in section  [ sec : resultsnloiam ] and for nnlo in section  [ sec : resultsnnloiam ] .",
    "we will discuss and summarize all our findings in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "pions are the goldstone bosons associated to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of qcd .",
    "if quarks were strictly massless , pions would be massless too and separated by a gap of the order of 1 gev from the rest of hadrons , becoming the relevant qcd low energy degrees of freedom .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite is nothing but the most general lagrangian built out as an expansion in pion momenta ( i.e. , derivatives ) respecting the qcd symmetries . in real life , though , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks have a very small mass , that we will take in the isospin limit as @xmath14 , which can be treated as a perturbation within chpt .",
    "as a consequence pions have a physical mass of @xmath15mev , whose model independent perturbative expansion in terms of @xmath16 is given by chpt . in summary , the qcd low energy theory we will use is su(2 ) chpt @xcite , which corresponds to considering the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks only and integrating out the other four quarks , whose effect will be included in the low energy constants ( lecs ) that multiply each term of the chpt lagrangian . in this way only pions will circulate in the loops .",
    "hence , by varying the pion mass while keeping the chpt low energy constants fixed , we are sensitive to the light quark mass dependence for constant @xmath17 and @xmath18 masses .      pion - pion elastic scattering is customarily described in terms of partial wave amplitudes @xmath19 of definite isospin @xmath20 and angular momentum @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mandelstam variable , although for simplicity we will drop these indices when there is no possible confusion . from chpt these partial waves are obtained as a series expansion @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 stands generically for center of mass momenta or pion masses . the leading order ( lo ) @xmath26 is @xmath27 and is universal @xcite in the sense that it only depends on the scale @xmath28mev and @xmath4 .",
    "the nlo calculation yields @xmath29 @xcite and is obtained from one - loop diagrams with lo vertices and tree diagrams from the nlo lagrangian terms , which are multiplied by some low energy constants ( lecs ) , called @xmath30 .",
    "these lecs absorb the dependence on the loop regularization scale @xmath31 , and are determined by the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "their measured values can be found in table  [ standardlecs ] .",
    "something similar happens with the nnlo result @xmath32 @xcite , which has two loop contributions with lo vertices , one - loop contributions with one lo vertex and one nlo vertex containing some @xmath33 , plus tree level diagrams with nnlo vertices , whose lecs appear only in six combinations now called @xmath34 , whose estimated values are listed also in table  [ standardlecs ] .",
    "all these lecs carry a scale dependence that cancels that from loop integrals , so that observables are scale independent and finite order by order .    .",
    "chpt low energy constants from @xcite that contribute to @xmath7 scattering to @xmath35 and @xmath0 that we use in our standard chpt calculations .",
    "the value for @xmath36(@xmath31 ) comes from a recent analysis of the lattice results @xcite .",
    "the renormalization scale is set to @xmath37mev .",
    "errors are only statistical or `` only account for the noise seen in the calculations '' of @xcite .",
    "the first four @xmath38 and their uncertainties are obtained from resonance saturation .",
    "the @xmath39 value is from @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     now , elastic unitarity implies for partial waves , at physical values of @xmath22 , that : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath25 being the center of mass momentum . as a consequence ,",
    "the modulus of @xmath42 is related to its phase : @xmath43 this `` phase shift '' @xmath44 , which determines completely the amplitude , is the usual way to parametrize partial waves , that we will use next to predict the amplitude variation when the pion mass is changed . of course , before extrapolating to other pion masses , we will compare the chpt amplitudes , with and without unitarization , with the existing experimental data .",
    "chpt amplitudes , being an expansion , satisfy unitarity only perturbatively : @xmath45 in particular , chpt partial waves are expected to violate unitarity as @xmath22 increases , since they are basically polynomials in @xmath22 . in section  [ sec : iam ] we will use chpt inside dispersion relations to obtain amplitudes that , while respecting the chpt expansion at low energies , satisfy unitarity and allow and provide a good description of experiment up to higher energies .    after this brief introduction to chpt and its notation , we are now ready to present our first calculations .",
    "using the equations above , the phase shift within standard chpt is obtained as a series expansion ( see @xcite for a prescription on how to perform this expansion ) : @xmath46 which are the expressions used in our one - loop and two - loop calculations , respectively , that we detail next .",
    "now , let us recall that the pion  and quark  mass dependence of the partial waves @xmath42 within chpt comes from two different sources : from kinematics , through pion propagators , or from the dynamics encoded in the vertices . in particular , the threshold shift is purely of a kinematic nature and rather trivial to understand .",
    "therefore , although @xmath7 phase shifts are customarily presented in terms of @xmath47 , we are showing them here as a function of the center of mass momentum @xmath25 , which is also more convenient to compare to lattice studies . with this kinematic threshold effect",
    "`` subtracted '' , the remaining @xmath4 dependence is rather mild for most partial waves . as we will see this soft dependence of the @xmath48 on @xmath4",
    "has been also found for @xmath3 waves in very recent lattice calculations @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuop4 ] we show the phase shifts from the one - loop chpt , i.e. @xmath35 , for the @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath7 scattering waves .",
    "note that for the @xmath50 channel , the description fails much before @xmath51  mev .",
    "this momentum is typically below the @xmath2 resonance region , which is a natural applicability bound for the chpt series .",
    "this resonance has a relatively narrow shape , corresponding to a pole close to the real axis in the second riemann sheet , which , of course , is completely missed by one - loop chpt except in its very low energy tail . in contrast , one - loop chpt is giving a fairly good description of the @xmath52 channel even up to , say @xmath53 or 400  mev . in this case",
    "there is also a resonance  the scalar @xmath11 ( or @xmath1) , but it is very wide and its pole is deep in the complex plane , so that it is not seen in the real axis as the typical sharp rise in the phase . for this reason , and despite being an expansion which has no such a pole in the complex plane ,",
    "chpt results are not very different qualitatively from the data in this channel .",
    "finally , we see that the one - loop description of the @xmath54 channel is also reasonably good up to such high momentum , mostly due to the fact that this channel has no resonances and also that the data are not particularly precise .",
    "phase shifts from standard chpt up to one loop .",
    "different lines stand for different pion masses @xmath55 and 350  mev , respectively . since the lines are too close to each other , we only show error bands for the physical mass .",
    "experimental data come from  @xcite ( black circles ) and the precise model independent dispersive data analysis from @xcite ( white circles ) .",
    "the arrows show the direction of increasing @xmath4 .",
    "[ fig : nuop4 ] ]    the gray areas in the figure cover the uncertainties due to the statistical error in the lecs detailed in the previous section . in order to calculate these areas",
    "we have used a montecarlo sampling . for each phase - shift calculation",
    "we have generated 5000 different samples of lecs using a gaussian distribution with variances equal to the errors quoted in table  [ standardlecs ] . to avoid a confusing overlapping between uncertainty bands ,",
    "we only show the one corresponding to the physical pion mass . in the appendix we provide a detailed study of the evolution of these uncertainties with @xmath4 . as a general feature for both scalar and vector waves , the relative uncertainty of the phase at a given momentum grows slowly with @xmath4 .",
    "once we have checked where one - loop chpt calculations provide an acceptable description of data , we can now compare , also in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuop4 ] , with the the results obtained if we change the pion mass from its physical value to @xmath56 and @xmath57  mev .",
    "the first observation is that the sign of the phase derivative does not change when increasing the pion mass , at least up to 350  mev , which means that the attractive or repulsive nature of each wave is conserved .    in that figure",
    "we have represented with an arrow the direction of the phase movement as @xmath4 increases .",
    "thus , the next observation is that both scalar phase shifts increase in absolute value as @xmath4 grows , whereas the phase of the vector channel decreases .",
    "the behavior of the phase at low momentum in the vector channel may seem surprising at first , because several lattice works @xcite , the chiral effective treatment @xcite , as well as the iam @xcite , predict that the @xmath2 mass increases much slower than the @xmath58 threshold as @xmath4 grows .",
    "but then , when the @xmath2 peak reaches a given momentum , the phase there should be @xmath59 to a very good approximation . therefore , one would expect naively the phase at low momentum to rise as @xmath4 grows .",
    "however the model independent chpt analysis , tells us otherwise .",
    "we will see in detail in section [ sec : rhobehavior ] why this intuitive picture fails and the phase shift actually has to decrease at first and increase later on .",
    "phase shifts from standard chpt up to one loop .",

    "experimental data come from  @xcite .",
    "the arrows show the direction of increasing @xmath4 . ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuop4d ] we show the one - loop chpt results for the d waves : @xmath60 and @xmath6 .",
    "we show these separately because both them vanish at @xmath27 , so that the one - loop @xmath35 calculation is just their lo contribution .",
    "actually they are both very small at low energies .",
    "we can see in the figures that the one - loop chpt calculation provides an acceptable solution for the ( 2,2 ) wave up to relatively high momentum , but obviously it can not reproduce the resonance shape of the @xmath61 resonance in the @xmath62 channel . as before , we only show the uncertainty band due to the statistical errors on the lecs for the physical pion mass , obtained again from a montecarlo gaussian sample . relative uncertainties for different pion masses are detailed in the appendix .",
    "note that , in contrast to the scalar waves , both tensor phase shifts decrease in absolute value as the pion mass increases not too far from its physical value . in this sense , they are more similar to the vector channel behavior . remarkably , for larger pion masses and momentum",
    "the ( 0,2 ) phase shift even changes sign and the derivative becomes negative .",
    "however , this behavior is not found at two loops , as we will see in the next subsection .",
    "we use the two - loop @xmath7 scattering calculation in @xcite .",
    "note , however , that instead of the usual @xmath63 parameters , in order to implement the @xmath4 dependence we need to use the one - loop @xmath64 and @xmath38 parameters in table  [ standardlecs ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuop6 ] we show the resulting phase shifts for the @xmath65 , ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,0 ) waves for the physical @xmath4 but also for @xmath56 and 350  mev .",

    "the uncertainty bands , which we show only for the physical pion mass  see the appendix for other masses ",
    "are once again calculated with a montecarlo gaussian sampling of 5000 sets of lecs , using as standard deviations the uncertainties quoted in table  [ standardlecs ] .",
    "the only exception are the @xmath67 parameters , which are estimated from resonance saturation and , as in @xcite , we have assumed that all values in the interval from 0 to twice the estimation are equally likely .",
    "of course , we want to emphasize that this is just an estimate of the values of the @xmath0 parameters , which are rather difficult to determine .",
    "possible improvements in their determinations could come from future lattice - qcd calculations , as it has already been done with the @xmath35 lecs ( see @xcite for a review ) or from the use of recent dispesive data analysis like that in @xcite inside threshold parameter sum rules @xcite .",
    "also , since the renormalization scale @xmath31 where the estimates for @xmath67 and @xmath68 apply is not known , another source of uncertainty appears .",
    "our calculations are made at @xmath69 mev so , in order to account for the uncertainty due to that choice , we have followed @xcite again and we have calculated the shift occurring in the phase shift if @xmath67 are fixed and the scale is changed to @xmath70  mev and @xmath71  gev .",
    "that shift is added in quadrature to the errors given by the montecarlo sampling .",
    "the general features of the one - loop description still apply to the two - loop case .",
    "namely , all waves keep their attractive or repulsive nature , and both scalar phases increase in absolute value as @xmath4 grows , whereas the vector channel phase decreases .",
    "the counterintuitive behavior of the @xmath2 is therefore a robust prediction of chpt . in the next section",
    "we will explain with a simple model why chiral symmetry requires this behavior . still , the description of the ( 0,0 ) wave is fair only up to @xmath72 or 350 mev , although it has improved remarkably in the low energy region , where the data are most recent and reliable , as they come from @xmath73 decays .",
    "the @xmath50 phase is now much closer to the experimental data , and thus it seems to provide a fairly good representation up to , say @xmath74  mev .",
    "however , the description of the @xmath54 has deteriorated for higher momenta , and seems to be good only up to , roughly , 200 or 250  mev .    however , despite the qualitative @xmath4 dependence being similar to the one - loop case , quantitatively the effect is stronger . in absolute value",
    "all phase shifts grow faster with @xmath4 to two loops than they did to one loop .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuop6d ] we show the two - loop result for the d waves . as commented before , these waves have no @xmath27 term , so , this @xmath0 calculation is just a next to leading order calculation .",
    "we can see that the differences with the one loop case are dramatic .",
    "the @xmath60 phase suffers a remarkable improvement , being able to describe the tail of the @xmath75 resonance up to momentum of the order of 350 mev .",
    "contrary to the one - loop case , within the @xmath4 range of this study , the @xmath62 phase does not become negative . finally , the @xmath6 phase shift fails to describe even the sign of the data , and is only relatively close to the data points below 150  mev .",
    "furthermore , the one - loop @xmath4 phase shift dependence was opposite to the two - loop case : from more negative to less negative for the former versus from positive to negative for the second .",
    "the predictions for this channel are therefore not very robust , which is also corroborated by the large uncertainties for higher @xmath4 that can be found in the appendix .",
    "as we have already commented , there are very recent lattice results on phase shifts for the @xmath3 , @xmath77 @xcite and @xmath78 channels @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ fig : lattice_nu_20 ] and [ fig : lattice_nu_22 ] we compare the one and two - loop calculations within standard chpt , first for the physical mass versus experimental data , and then for @xmath79 and 524  mev , versus lattice results .    when we examine fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice_nu_20 ] , corresponding to the @xmath3 , @xmath77 phase shifts , the first observation is that all lattice points with @xmath80  mev are well described within the uncertainties of one - loop chpt , even up to @xmath81   mev . from the figure",
    ", we observe that a pion mass of @xmath82   mev seems out of reach and will not be considered any longer . beyond that momentum ,",
    "the chpt calculation bends downwards and misses all other lattice results with higher momenta .",
    "remarkably the two - loop chpt results do not improve this agreement .",
    "actually , the two - loop calculation describes somewhat worse the lattice data and seems to move consistently to more negative values than those observed on the lattice , as @xmath4 grows higher .",
    "let us remark that the curvature downwards is larger in the two - loop result than just to one loop . in view of the figures",
    "it seems that the standard chpt applicability limit is , at best , somewhere around @xmath83  mev , up to @xmath4 of the order of @xmath84  mev .",
    "unfortunately , for the @xmath3 , @xmath78 channel , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice_nu_22 ] , there are no lattice results available at low momentum .",
    "surprisingly , the one - loop calculation agrees quite nicely with the lattice values up to around @xmath85  mev even for the highest pion mass .",
    "however , the two - loop results show a very strong @xmath4 dependence that is in complete disagreement with the behavior predicted by the lattice simulations .",
    "even the tendency is wrong , since the absolute value of the phase seems to grow with @xmath4 whereas lattice results may suggest a decrease .",
    "let us nevertheless recall that for d - waves the tree level amplitude vanishes , so that one and two - loop calculations correspond only to leading and next to leading order results .",
    "higher order calculations may be needed to improve and stabilize the d wave description .    , @xmath77 channel compared to lattice results coming from  @xcite ( circles ) and  @xcite ( triangles ) . ]    , @xmath78 channel compared to lattice results coming from  @xcite ( circles ) .",
    "note the large difference between one and two loop results . ]",
    "we have seen that , within chpt , the low momentum phase shift of the vector channel is found to decrease as @xmath4 grows .",
    "this is a model independent result and looks rather robust since it is obtained both at one and two - loops .",
    "however , lattice results @xcite , the chiral effective treatment @xcite , as well as the iam @xcite predict that , in terms of momentum , the @xmath2 peak gets closer and closer to threshold .",
    "thus , for any low momentum choice , and as @xmath4 increases , the @xmath2 peak reaches that given momentum , so that the phase there should be @xmath59 .",
    "therefore one would naively expect the phase shift for any fixed low momentum to grow with @xmath4 .    actually , this is what one would find if , to describe the @xmath2 resonance pole , one uses the very simple and intuitive ( but , as we will see below , incomplete ) breit - wigner model @xmath86 where , @xmath87 and the width is : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the resonance mass , @xmath90 is the pion momentum at the resonance energy @xmath91 so that @xmath42 behaves correctly at threshold , @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath93 is the @xmath2 decay width .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us now assume that the resonance mass @xmath89 and coupling remain constant when changing the pion mass @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that @xmath89 and @xmath94 are @xmath4 independent . for our illustration purposes here , this is a fairly good approximation to what has been found on the lattice or with the iam , and it could be considered as the leading order term in the @xmath4 expansion ( see @xcite for the @xmath2 mass ) .    in such case",
    ", however , the phase - shift @xmath4 dependence near threshold does not follow what is obtained from chpt ( or the iam as we will see below ) .",
    "in particular , since @xmath95 the only @xmath4 dependence in @xmath96 ( for a given @xmath25 ) is through @xmath90 ( and @xmath97 ) so that @xmath98 however , in chpt , for low @xmath25 we have shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nuop4 ] and [ fig : nuop6 ] that @xmath99 .    of course , it is very well known that a simple breit - wigner vector formalism is not consistent with the chiral expansion unless there are some additional low energy contributions or contact terms in the lagrangian formalism @xcite .",
    "just to keep things very simple we can use a modification of the breit - wigner parametrization , which is widely used in analysis of @xmath7 scattering and other phenomenology involving decays into light mesons @xcite , and reads @xmath100 here @xmath101 is @xmath4 independent and @xmath102 are the blatt - weisskopf centrifugal barrier functions @xcite , that for @xmath103 read @xmath104 . all the @xmath4 dependence is carried by @xmath90 and the new parameter @xmath105 , which is usually interpreted as a crude estimate of the `` size '' of the meson , although it should not be identified with its mean square charge radius . at low momentum",
    "we now find @xmath106 where @xmath107 stands for @xmath108 . in order to have a decreasing phase shift at low @xmath25 when increasing @xmath4 , we just need @xmath109",
    ". we will see below that this is actually required by chiral symmetry at leading order in the pion mass expansion .",
    "this would explain the phase decrease seen in chpt for not too large @xmath4 , even though the @xmath2 is approaching threshold as @xmath4 grows .",
    "of course , when @xmath4 grows too large , and particularly in the limit when the @xmath2 tends to threshold , so that @xmath110 , the derivative is positive , and the phase shift increases , as one would have expected naively .",
    "let us then check that chiral symmetry actually requires @xmath109 at least for low pion masses .",
    "we can estimate the leading @xmath4 dependence of @xmath105 by comparing the low momentum and mass expansion of the amplitude in eqs . using , with that of chpt .",
    "in particular , since in this simple model we have only one parameter , @xmath105 , we will only compare the scattering lengths .",
    "our aim is just to reproduce the leading order @xmath4 dependence , since we have already made additional approximations and simplifications ( like the constancy of the @xmath2 mass and coupling ) .",
    "we define the scattering length , @xmath111 , as @xmath112 .",
    "the low @xmath25 expansion of the amplitude in eqs . using leads to @xmath113 this result has to be compared with that of chpt : @xmath114 .",
    "matching with chpt we obtain for @xmath115 @xmath116 the value obtained with this chpt estimation is compatible with what is found in the literature ( @xmath117 gev@xmath118 ) @xcite .",

    "however , this is a very well known feature of hadrons , at least for the charge radius .",
    "actually , the squared charged radius of the pion and the nucleon show a @xmath120 singularity @xcite and the pauli radius of the nucleon an additional @xmath121 singularity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as we have commented , our @xmath115 parameter should not be directly identified with the @xmath2 charged radius , although our results suggest that they may have a similar singularity .    with this @xmath4 dependence for @xmath105",
    "we find that @xmath122 which is negative for the physical values of the parameters .",
    "this guarantees that @xmath123 for @xmath4 not far from @xmath124 , and sufficiently low @xmath25 , as is obtained in chpt .",
    "the decrease is a robust feature of chpt , although the pure chiral expansion can not reproduce the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "of course , the model we have presented here is very simple and naive , but provides a qualitative and intuitive explanation of why chiral symmetry implies that the vector phase shift at low momenta first decreases , although it may increase later as @xmath4 grows .",
    "this model can not be pushed too far . in particular",
    ", we can not reproduce the chiral behavior of the scattering length beyond leading order or even the slope parameter .",
    "it is however possible to incorporate simultaneously the @xmath2 pole and the full low energy chpt expansion to one and two - loops . in the next section",
    "we will explain the technique in detail and later on we will show how it describes the existing lattice data up to much higher momentum than standard chpt . actually we will check how the vector phase shift decreases first and then increases as @xmath4 grows .",

    "[ sec : perturbativepipi ] , the partial waves obtained from the chpt expansion are basically a truncated series in momenta or energies and can not satisfy elastic unitarity , eq .",
    ", exactly , but only perturbatively , as in eq ..    there is , however , a well known technique , known as unitarization , to obtain expressions for partial waves that satisfy elastic unitarity , have the correct analytic structure in terms of cuts in the complex plane , and simultaneously respect the chpt expansion up to a given order . here",
    "we will make use of the elastic inverse amplitude method ( iam)or a slightly modified version  that implements the fully renormalized one or two - loop chpt expansion at low energies but does not introduce any spurious parameter in the unitarization procedure . had we used other , possibly simpler but very successful , unitarization techniques with spurious parameters , like cutoff or any other regulator , we should have had to worry about the unknown @xmath4 dependence of that scale .",
    "the iam @xcite uses elastic unitarity and the chpt expansion to evaluate a once subtracted dispersion relation for the inverse amplitude .",
    "the analytic structure of @xmath125 consists on a right cut from threshold to @xmath126 , a left cut from @xmath127 to 0 , and possible poles coming from zeros of @xmath18 .",
    "we can write then a once subtracted dispersion relation for @xmath125 , the subtraction point being @xmath128 , @xmath129 where @xmath130 stands for a similar integral over the left cut and @xmath131 is the contribution of the pole at @xmath128 .",
    "the choice of @xmath128 is , in principle , arbitrary , but since we want to use the information encoded in the chpt series , we are then limited to the low energy region , preferably , below threshold .",
    "now , scalar waves vanish at the so called adler zero that lies in the real axis below threshold and in practice this is a very convenient choice for @xmath128 , which has actually motivated our notation . for other waves",
    "there is no such an adler zero , and the subtraction point can be taken , for instance at @xmath132 .",
    "it is important to remark that the choice of subtraction point , as long as it lies between the left and right cut , has only a very small numerical effect @xcite on the physical region . up to here",
    "everything is exact .",
    "the most relevant observation is that , following eq .",
    ", on the elastic cut we know exactly @xmath133 .",
    "now we are going to derive the iam within one - loop chpt .",
    "first , the adler zero position can be approximated as , @xmath134 , where @xmath26 vanishes at @xmath135 , @xmath136 vanishes at @xmath137 , and so on . on the right cut we can evaluate exactly @xmath138 , as can be read from eqs . and .",
    "since the left cut is weighted at low energies we can use one - loop chpt to approximate @xmath139 .",
    "the pole contribution @xmath131 can be safely calculated with chpt since it involves derivatives of @xmath18 evaluated at @xmath128 , which is a low energy point where chpt is perfectly justified .",
    "altogether , we arrive to a modified one - loop iam ( miam ) formula @xcite : @xmath140}{s - s_a } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the first derivative with respect to @xmath22 and where we use for @xmath128 in the numerical calculations its nlo approximation @xmath137 .",
    "the standard iam formula is recovered for @xmath141 , which is indeed the case for all partial waves except the scalar ones . in the original iam derivation @xcite @xmath142",
    "was neglected since it formally yields a higher order contribution and is numerically very small except near the adler zero . however",
    ", if @xmath142 is neglected , the iam adler zero occurs at @xmath135 , correctly only to lo , is a double zero instead of a simple one , and a spurious pole appears close to the adler zero .",
    "all of these caveats disappear with the miam , and the differences between the iam and the miam in the physical and resonance region are of the order of 1% .",
    "it is important to remark that chpt has _ not _ been used _ at all _ for calculations of @xmath42 for positive energies above threshold . note that the use of chpt is well justified to calculate @xmath128 , and @xmath131 , since these are low energy calculations .",
    "chpt has also been used to calculate the left cut integral , which , despite extending to infinity , is heavily weighted at low energies , which once again justifies the use of chpt .",
    "the left cut and the elastic approximation are the only approximations used to obtain the iam , but no other model dependent assumptions have been made .",
    "in particular there are no spurious parameters included in the iam derivation , but just the chpt lecs , @xmath4 and @xmath143 .",
    "remarkably , these simple equations ( either the iam or the miam ) ensure elastic unitarity , match chpt at low energies and , using lecs compatible with existing determinations , describe fairly well data up to somewhat less than 1 gev , generating the @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath11 and @xmath146 resonances as poles on the second riemann sheet @xcite .",
    "the extension to two loops is very similar and straightforward for the iam @xcite or the miam @xcite : @xmath147    let us now remark that both in the one and two - loop derivations above , we have assumed that @xmath26 is not identically zero .",
    "however , this is only the case for scalar and vector partial waves .",
    "unfortunately , as seen in eq .",
    ", when @xmath148 the first imaginary part appears at @xmath149 , namely , at three loops . therefore we can not recast the dispersion relation in terms of the full chpt expansion unless we make use of @xmath150 , a calculation that does not exist . in @xcite , and using only the @xmath151 term of the form @xmath152 , it was shown that the @xmath75 shape could be fairly well fitted with the iam and a @xmath153 value of the correct order of magnitude expected from dimensional grounds .",
    "this was justified because the @xmath154 resonance appears at high @xmath155 and the other @xmath149 terms , containing pion mass powers , could be neglected . however , in this work we want to make @xmath4 much larger than its physical value and we need the @xmath4 dependence .",
    "it is therefore not so well justified to neglect all the @xmath151 terms except @xmath156 .",
    "for that reason we are limited to use the iam for scalar and vector partial waves .",
    "hence , using the iam or the miam , we can study how the generated @xmath144 and @xmath11 poles evolve by changing @xmath4 in the one loop iam amplitudes @xcite or two - loop amplitudes @xcite , and describe the dependence of their masses , widths and couplings on @xmath4 . in @xcite",
    "the miam was used for the @xmath144 and @xmath11 chiral extrapolation , because , for the scalar and at high @xmath4 , one resonance pole gets near the iam spurious pole , a problem that is nicely solved with the miam .",
    "nevertheless , in the physical region and near the other generated poles , the differences between iam and miam approaches are almost negligible , even for high pion masses .    of course , the poles are not the only object of study on the lattice",
    ". actually , lattice results are already available for phase shifts in @xmath3 channels , where no pole exists .",
    "moreover these channels were not studied in @xcite .",
    "it is also very likely that lattice results on phase shifts for other channels will be available soon . for these reasons we will now let @xmath4 vary within our unitarized chpt expressions , with the aim of extending the phase shift predictions based on chpt , up to higher masses and momenta .",
    "let us first recall , as already explained in some of the very first works on the iam @xcite , and repeated in many other instances @xcite , that when the central values of the standard lecs are used , the iam only improves chpt up to a couple of hundred mev higher and resonances are only reproduced qualitatively . for a semi - quantitative description of resonances , which is what we will do next , one has to fit the data and the resulting lecs are slightly modified from those obtained from pure chpt . since the iam contains contributions that count as higher order in chpt ( in particular the numerically relevant s - channel logarithms ) , one would very naively expect the lecs from the one - loop iam to lie somewhere in between the one and two loop values from chpt .",
    "this is actually observed , since the @xmath35 iam lecs in table  [ tab : lecsiamnlo ] lie somewhere between the one and two loop analysis of pure chpt listed in table  [ tab : otherlecs ] , although closer to the chpt @xmath35 analysis in the two first rows of that table .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath35 values of the lecs for the two - loop iam in table  [ tab : lecsiamnnlo ] are closer to the two loop analyses like that in table  [ standardlecs ] or those in the third and fourth row of table  [ tab : otherlecs ] .",
    "let us emphasize that the variation between the @xmath35 lecs values between the one and two loop analyses already occurs in pure chpt  particularly for @xmath157 .",
    "the iam simply follows a similar pattern .    before changing the pion mass ,",
    "let us note that for the iam we are assuming the elastic approximation and therefore , when increasing @xmath4 we should allow for some @xmath7 elastic regime , which is guaranteed if @xmath158 mev , although it has been found that relatively stable unitarized results can be obtained for all waves only up to @xmath159mev @xcite .",
    "of course some waves are more stable than others .",
    "in particular the elastic iam approximation is quite good up to larger energies for the @xmath160 ( roughly up to @xmath161 , see @xcite ) , since it has no resonances and does not couple to @xmath162 . we will actually check that for this channel we can stretch the applicability range and still get fairly good agreement with recent lattice results for relatively large pion masses .      in fig .",

    "we have found that up to momenta less than 200  mev , the chpt results are in fair agreement with lattice data for the scalar @xmath3 channel .",
    "we have found that , surprisingly , the vector phase - shift at very low momentum decreases as @xmath4 grows within the applicability region .",

    "the description provided by this method is of course compatible with that of standard chpt at very low momentum .",

    "in addition , we have shown that the unitarized @xmath3 scalar phase shift has the correct qualitative behavior for momentum beyond 200  mev . despite being close to the applicability bounds of the approach",

    "intuitively , the phase shift evolution of the s0 and p channels is dominated by the presence of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances and their pion mass dependence , studied in @xcite .",
    "since the masses of both resonances seem to grow slower than the pion mass , they come closer and closer to threshold , so that , naively one would expect the interaction to grow stronger and the phase to raise once the resonance is sufficiently close to the momentum where the phase is measured .",
    "actually , this is what is found for the s0 channel , whose phase raises noticeably as @xmath4 grows . at the limit of the range of applicability of the two - loop iam ,",
    "the @xmath1 even becomes a bound state and by levinson s theorem we see the phase to increase by @xmath190 at threshold .",
    "however , the naive expectations may not be met if the resonance is still not close enough to threshold . in such case , the phase may seem to decrease at first due to the finite size of the resonance , which effect has been illustrated in a simple model of the @xmath2 . only when the @xmath2 is sufficiently close to threshold , the naively expected behavior is observed . concerning the s2 wave , we have found a very mild @xmath4 dependence for the phase shift , when expressed in terms of the momentum , in good agreement with recent lattice calculations .",
    "this can be understood from the absence of resonant structures in this channel .",
    "of course , chpt can only reproduce the low energy tails of the resonances , which we have generated by means of chpt unitarized with the iam .",
    "for the d waves , the iam can not be applied to this order , and we have to rely on chpt only . however , the behavior observed can also be understood from the presence of the @xmath61 resonance in the d0 channel , and a similar behavior to the @xmath2 in its own channel . for the d2 channel the chpt results are not sufficiently precise to make any conclusive statement .",

    "in fig .  [ fig : errores_stchpt ] we plot the relative uncertainties of the standard chpt phase shift calculation . as we have already seen , standard chpt is limited to low momentum and thus we only show momentum up to @xmath194 mev . for the scalar and vector waves we see that in the low momentum region the errors grow with the pion mass .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that the lecs that govern the mass dependence of the partial waves carry the biggest uncertainties . for d - waves ,",
    "the relative uncertainty is much bigger than for lower angular momentum waves .",
    "( note the difference in scales between the d waves and the rest of the plots ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that for d - waves the tree level calculation vanishes and therefore the one and two loop results are just leading and next to leading order . in the case of @xmath195 to one loop",
    "the error seems to explode for the highest masses due to the phase shift changing from a positive to a negative value in the region of interest .",
    "the same occurs for @xmath196 to one loop for the physical value of the pion mass . finally , the value of @xmath196 to two loops changes from negative to positive for the lightest masses of the pion .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : errores_iam ] we show the relative uncertainties for the iam phase shifts .",
    "we find again that for scalar waves they grow bigger as the pion mass is increased .",
    "the same happens for the vector phase shift below the @xmath2 peak .",
    "the highest uncertainty on @xmath197 occurs when the slope of the phase shift reaches its maximum value .",
