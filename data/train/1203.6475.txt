    "magnetic chemically peculiar ( mcp ) stars present photometric , spectroscopic and magnetic variability with a single period . as to the magnetic field ,",
    "the most important observable is the effective or longitudinal magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) , that is the average over the stellar visible disk of the longitudinal components of the magnetic field @xcite . to explain the previous phenomenology @xcite and @xcite proposed the presence of a magnetic dipole",
    ", whose axis is tilted with respect to the rotational axis , the so called oblique rotator model , and a non - uniform distribution of some chemical elements on the stellar surface which rotates rigidly .",
    "spectral , light and magnetic variability would be a consequence of stellar rotation .",
    "later , it has been cleared that the mcp stars can present multipolar magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite collect all available mcp magnetic curves and they show that in many cases their shape is more complex then a simple sinusoidal wave .    non - thermal radio emission is observed from about 25% of the mcp stars @xcite . in accord with the oblique rotator model ,",
    "the radio emission is also variable as a consequence of the stellar rotation @xcite , suggesting that the radio emission arises from a stable optically thick co - rotating magnetosphere .",
    "radio emission is ascribed to a radiatively - driven stellar wind .",
    "the gas flow brakes the magnetic field lines far from the star ( alfvn surface ) forming current sheets , where electrons are accelerated to the mildly relativistic regime .",
    "energetic electrons propagate back , along thin magnetospheric layers named middle magnetosphere , to the inner magnetospheric regions radiating by gyrosynchrotron emission mechanism at the radio wavelengths @xcite .    out of mcp stars , cuvirginis ( hd124224 = hr5313 ) is the only known source characterized by broadband , highly polarized and time - stable pulses at 1.4 and 2.5  ghz @xcite . @xcite",
    "have also reported a pulse detection at 610 mhz .",
    "radio pulses stand out for 1 dex over the continuous emission , the single pulse duration ranges from 5 to 10% of the rotational period and are observed in coincidence with the null values of @xmath1 , that is when the magnetic dipole axis is perpendicular to the line of sight .    such a behavior has been ascribed to the electron cyclotron maser ( ecm ) emission mechanism powered by an anisotropic pitch - angle ( angle between electron velocity and local magnetic field ) distribution that the non - thermal electrons , responsible of the gyrosynchrotron stellar radio emission , can develop propagating in a magnetic flux tube towards regions of increasing magnetic field strength .",
    "electrons with an initial large pitch - angle are soon reflected outward due to the magnetic mirroring , whereas electrons with a small pitch angle can reach the inner magnetospheric layers where they are thermalized in the dense plasma .",
    "the reflected electron population is characterized by a pitch angle distribution deprived by the electrons with a small pitch angle .",
    "this mechanism amplifies the extraordinary magneto - ionic mode producing nearly 100% circularly polarized radiation at frequencies very close to the first or second harmonic of the local gyro - frequency ( @xmath2 ghz ) , in a direction almost perpendicular to the local magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "however the fundamental harmonic is probably suppressed by the gyromagnetic absorption .",
    "the ecm mechanism has been considered to account for the strongly polarized , intense and narrow band short time spikes observed in the sun @xcite , dme flare stars @xcite and rscvn binaries @xcite .",
    "ecm explains the planetary low frequency emission , in particular the jupiter decametric radiation and the earth s auroral kilometric radiation ( akr ) @xcite .",
    "the fully polarized pulses observed on cuvir are broadband and persistent over long timescale ( years ) .",
    "the large bandwidth is a consequence of the wide range of the magnetic field strength in the region where the maser amplification occurs .",
    "the observed maser emission is the superimposition of narrowband emission from different rings above the magnetic poles .",
    "the continuos supply of non - thermal electrons , developing a loss - cone anisotropy , maintains stable the electron cyclotron maser emission .",
    "following the tangent plane beaming model , proposed for the akr @xcite and successfully applied to explain the narrow peaks observed on cuvir @xcite , the amplified radiation is beamed tangentially to the polar ring where the cyclotron maser instability takes place .",
    "then , during the propagation through the denser magnetized plasma of the inner magnetosphere , the radiation is refracted upward by a few degrees @xcite .",
    "since the magnitude of this angle depends on frequency , the radiation is detected in different moments during the rotation of the star , causing a frequency drift of the observed pulses .",
    "highly polarized broad - band radio pulses , still explained as ecm , have been also recognized in the ultra cool main sequence dwarf stars @xcite . despite the great difference of the physical characteristics between these two extreme classes of stars ,",
    "late m and mcp stars show similar behavior at the radio wavelengths .",
    "the existence of a well ordered and stable axisymmetric magnetic field in the rapidly rotating fully convective m type stars @xcite can be the reason of the observed similarity .",
    "the study of the radio pulses from cuvir also provided the possibility to evidence variations of the stellar rotational period with a high degree of confidence @xcite .",
    "discovering the cuvirginis type coherent emission in other mcp stars would provide an useful tool for the study of the angular momentum evolution in this kind of stars .    on the basis of the results gathered from cuvir , the possibility to observe the same type of coherent emission from other mcp stars requires an appropriate stellar magnetic field geometry , with @xmath1 presenting at least a null value during the stellar rotation . among the already known mcp stars presenting radio emission @xmath0orie",
    "( hd37479 = hr1932 ) is an ideal candidate to search for the presence of this type of coherent emission .",
    "its magnetic field presents the appropriate geometry , being the rotation axis inclination @xmath3 and magnetic axis obliquity @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the coherent pulses have been observed from cuvir ( @xmath5 g , @xcite ) at low frequencies ( @xmath6 2.5 ghz ) .",
    "we expect that ecm emission from @xmath0orie could be observed at higher frequencies , as a consequence of the stronger magnetic field ( @xmath7 g , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we present new multifrequency ( 1.4 , 5 , 8.4 , 15 , 22 and 43 ghz ) vla observations of @xmath0orie .",
    "in addition , to obtain as complete as possible radio light - curves , we have retrieved all unpublished vla archive data .",
    "the primary aim is to search for amplified emission strongly polarized , but we can also probe different layers of the @xmath0orie magnetosphere , because of the dependence of the frequency of the gyrosynchrotron radio emission from the magnetic field strength .",
    "@xmath0orie is a magnetic helium - strong star of spectral type b2v , mass @xmath8 m@xmath9 @xcite , radius @xmath10 r@xmath9 @xcite , located at a distance of about 350 pc @xcite .",
    "it is significantly hotter then cuvir ( spectral type a0v ) , this involves a stronger radiatively driven wind and , therefore , a greater mass loss rate . on the other hand , the polar magnetic field strength of @xmath0orie is 6800 g , versus 3000 g of cuvir , and the rotational period is 1.19@xmath11 , versus 0.52@xmath11 .",
    "all these two factors influence the confinement of the wind , resulting that the two stars have similar magnetospheres , both with alfvn radius about 15 r@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this reinforces our decision to search evidence of cuvir - type coherent emission from @xmath0orie .",
    "the long history of the photometric , spectroscopic and magnetic variability presented by @xmath0orie is documented in the _ catalog of observed periods for the ap stars _ by @xcite and its supplements @xcite .",

    "the spin down of @xmath0orie was already theoretically predicted by magnetohydrodynamics simulations @xcite .",

    "[ fit_b ] shows the magnetic field measurements of @xmath0orie by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite phased with the previous ephemeris . a data fit with a single wave equation : @xmath14    gives a reduced @xmath15 .",

    "@xcite shown that the @xmath26 variation due to a pure quadrupole is about 10% of the variability due to a dipole of equal polar strength .",
    "this means that @xmath0orie would present a quadrupole component at least two times stronger than the dipole one .",
    "the presence of multipolar magnetic components in @xmath0orie is testified by the asymmetric emission features on the h@xmath27 wings .",
    "these periodically variable features have been ascribed to two circumstellar plasma clouds trapped in the magnetosphere and co - rotating with the star @xcite ; trapped material was also recognized from uv observations @xcite . to explain why one of the two feature is stronger than the other , @xcite suggested an asymmetry in the two clouds . in the case of @xmath28oric ,",
    "an mcp star twin of @xmath0orie , also presenting similar asymmetric emission features on the h@xmath27 wings , @xcite mapped the circumstellar matter distribution and ascribed the asymmetry between the two clouds to the magnetic quadrupole component necessary to explain the stokes v profiles of the spectral lines .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0orie phenomenology can not be modeled as a simple dipole and that higher order components are necessary to explain the observational data .",

    "in this case the gyrosynchrotron mechanism give rise to radio emission partially polarized , respectively right hand for the north pole and left hand for the south pole .",
    "the overall behavior of the circularly polarized radiation from @xmath0orie resembles so closely the case of cuvir at 5 , 8.4 and 15 ghz @xcite .",

    "in order to investigate the radio emission from mcp stars , in @xcite we developed a 3d model to compute the gyrosynchrotron emission from a magnetosphere shaped in the framework of the oblique rotator model , that assumes a simple magnetic dipole . @xcite extended the 3d model to solve the radiation transfer for the circularly polarized emission ( stokes v parameter ) .",

    "a radiatively driven stellar wind flows along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the wind channeled by the magnetic field reaches the magnetic equator . at the alfvn radius , where the kinetic energy density of the wind exceeds the magnetic one , the stellar wind breaks the magnetic field lines generating current sheets , where particle acceleration occurs .",
    "the energetic electrons moving towards the stellar surface emit by gyrosynchrotron mechanism .",
    "this thin layer is named middle magnetosphere and it is connected to the annular regions around the magnetic poles at high magnetic latitudes . at lower magnetic latitudes the wind is",
    "instead confined in a dead zone ( inner magnetosphere ) , resulting in an accumulation of circumstellar matter whose density decreases outward , in accord with the magnetically confined wind shock model @xcite .",
    "this circumstellar material absorbs the continuous gyrosynchrotron radiation , resulting in the observed deep rotational modulation .",
    "here we adopt the model parameters given by @xcite , used to fit the literature 5 ghz light curve of @xmath0orie , to compute the expected radio flux density and fraction of circular polarization ( @xmath51 ) for all the frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ simulaz ] we have compared the simulations with the observations .",
    "the 1.4 ghz stokes i variability is reproduced in shape , however slightly overestimating the average flux .",
    "as to the highest frequencies , our 3d model fails to reproduce the observed stokes i variability . on the contrary , stokes v simulations are in good agreement with the measurements .",
    "since the source is optically thick , the radiation at different frequencies probes the stellar magnetosphere at different depths , where @xmath52 .",
    "higher frequencies are mainly emitted in the inner regions , where magnetic field is stronger .",
    "in particular , inspecting the modeled radio maps of @xmath0orie shown by @xcite , the bulk of the 5 ghz gyrosynchrotron emission arise from magnetospheric regions 3  8 r@xmath12 away from the stellar surface , whereas the 15 ghz originates from inner layers ( 1  5 r@xmath12 ) .    we conclude that the 3d model reproduces the behavior of the 1.4 and 5  ghz radio emission , coming mainly from regions far from the star , where the dipolar component of the magnetic field dominates .",
    "the nearly - dipolar symmetry can be also identified from the behavior of the polarized emission , well reproduced by the model simulations at all the frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ simulaz ] , bottom panels ) . at 8.4 and 15",
    "ghz the model instead fails to reproduce the observed stokes i modulation , as expected if a non dipolar magnetic field component is present .    in the case of gyrosynchrotron mechanism ,",
    "the radio emission from a region with almost parallel magnetic field lines directed toward us ( north ) , or in opposite direction ( south ) , is right - hand ( rcp ) , or left - hand ( lcp ) , circularly polarized ; stokes v , which is the difference between rcp and lcp , is positive , or negative ; stokes i , which is the sum of rcp and lcp is sensitive to both polarizations . in a region with dishomogeneous magnetic field on a small scale ,",
    "the polarization is , in average , null . when a quadrupolar field is present , we see always regions with antiparallel field lines ; stokes v is always null , while stokes i depends on the strength of each individual component . in this simple way we can explain the behavior of stokes v , which well agrees with the dipolar model at any frequency , and of the low frequency stokes i , arising from regions where only the dipolar field is relevant .",
    "the high frequency stokes i , instead , is sensitive to the quadrupolar component , important in the low magnetosphere .",
    "we are supported in such a conclusion from the stokes i and v variability presented at 5  ghz by hr5624 @xcite , that is characterized by a multi - polar magnetic field @xcite .    the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ spettri ] evidence as the radio flux density at the higher frequencies steeply rise going up to the maximum at phase @xmath53 , clearly observed in the 15 ghz light curve .",
    "this could be a consequence of strong dishomogeneity in the magnetic field close to the star .",
    "this work is aimed mainly at searching for cuvir - like pulses from @xmath0orie . in the following",
    "we will compute the expected frequency range of the ecm in our target .",
    "the minimum maser frequency observed in cuvir is 610mhz @xcite , the maximum is 2.5 ghz . since the maser frequency is a harmonic of the local gyrofrequency , @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , and assuming a simple dipolar field , for which the magnetic field strength above the pole is given by @xmath56 we can deduce that for cuvir ( @xmath5 g ) the maser at 610mhz",
    "is generated at @xmath57 above the stellar surface .",
    "the shaded area of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] defines the frequencies and the corresponding distances associated with the ecm pulses as observed on cuvir . at the same height , for @xmath0orie , with a polar field strength @xmath7  g",
    ", the corresponding frequency of emission is 1.4 ghz .",
    "therefore the cyclotron maser emission from @xmath0orie , if it does exist , should be observable at frequencies higher than 1.4 ghz .",
    "the maximum possible frequency is given by the second harmonic of the gyrofrequency very close to the stellar surface , corresponding to about 38 ghz .",
    "moreover , a necessary condition for the ecm is that the local plasma frequency must be lower than the local gyrofrequency , i.e. @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "since the plasma frequency is given by @xmath59 ghz , the maser emission near to the magnetic pole is possible only if the local thermal electron number density is less than about @xmath60 @xmath61 . in the current model",
    "the thin cavity where the maser should originate is the middle magnetosphere above the magnetic pole , where the local plasma is the ionized thermal wind that flows along the magnetic field lines .",
    "following @xcite and adopting the characteristic values of the wind derived with the 3d model for @xmath0orie @xcite , we estimate that the density of the wind is about @xmath62 @xmath61 near the stellar surface , well below the theoretical quenching limit .",
    "as the magnetic field strength decreases going outward , the plasma frequency equates the gyrofrequency at approximately 7r@xmath12 above the surface .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the condition for generation of the cyclotron maser is satisfied in the middle magnetosphere of @xmath0orie .     the radial behavior of the plasma density in the middle and inner magnetosphere , is shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] for @xmath0orie @xcite and cuvir @xcite .",
    "as recently observed on cuvir @xcite the ray path of the ecm , which is polarized in the @xmath63mode , is refracted by the plasma trapped in the inner magnetosphere , the refractive index is given by @xmath64 , with @xmath65 .",
    "since the conditions of the plasma are quite similar for @xmath0orie and cuvir ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , we expect an upwards refraction . in few words the radiation",
    "should be deviated , not absorbed .    despite the light curves in the expected frequency range of the ecm ( between 1.4 and 15 ghz )",
    "are well sampled , in particular near the rotational phases where we expect to detect it , i.e. in coincidence with at least one null of the magnetic curve ( fig .",
    "[ dati ] ) , we do not see any hint of the pulses as observed on cuvir .",
    "since the frequency of 1.4 and 15  ghz corresponds to the second harmonic of the local gyrofrequency at 2 and 0.4 r@xmath12 above the pole respectively , we can conclude that in this region the conditions needed to trigger the cyclotron maser are not fulfilled .    as highlighted in this paper , the magnetic field of @xmath0orie",
    "is characterized by the presence of a quadrupolar component , whose strength @xmath66 , which is prevailing in the stellar surface , decreases faster than the dipolar component ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) .",
    "therefore the actual magnetic vector in the low magnetosphere can be quite different from the simple dipolar one .",
    "as already discussed , this quadrupolar component significantly affects the gyrosynchrotron emission at high frequency , originating in the deep magnetospheric layers . in a similar way",
    ", the quadrupolar component of the magnetic field , stronger then the dipolar one at low altitude , affect the propagation of the electrons moving towards the stellar surface , causing the moving up of the magnetic mirroring point and consequently different interaction with the thermal plasma of the stellar magnetosphere , and possible changing of the ecm conditions .",
    "in fact , for a charged particle moving with a pitch angle @xmath69 in a not uniform magnetic field , its magnetic moment is invariant , i.e. @xmath70 constant , leading to magnetic mirroring when the particle moves in a converging magnetic field .",
    "assuming for @xmath0orie a simple dipolar field , a non - thermal electron injected with @xmath71 at the alfvn radius ( @xmath72 r@xmath12 ) , where @xmath73 g , will reach the stellar surface with a pitch angle @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "if there is a magnetic quadrupolar component , which is two or three times stronger than the strength of the dipolar field , the same electron is reflected at 0.3 ",
    "0.35 r@xmath12 from the surface , and can not reach the deeper and denser magnetospheric layers ; in this case it is reflected back without being absorbed",
    ". only those electrons injected at @xmath76 with a very small pitch angle ( @xmath77 ) can reach the stellar surface .",
    "accordingly , the fraction of non - thermal electrons that can develop an anisotropic pitch angle distribution is very small , and then the loss cone angle is already closed when the electrons reach the region where the maser at frequency below 15 ghz should arise .",
    "the quadrupole component vanishes 5  6 r@xmath12 away from the surface and this explain the observed @xmath0orie behavior .",
    "hot o - type stars have strong ionized stellar winds and , in few cases , organized magnetic fields @xcite , like mcp stars . such characteristics imply that the magnetic o - type stars may be sources of ecm .",
    "typically mcp stars have weak winds ( @xmath78 m@xmath9 yr@xmath79 ) strongly dominated by the magnetic fields ( @xmath80 110 kg ) , with large co - rotating magnetospheres .",
    "the measured magnetic field in the o - type stars is about 1 kg or less @xcite and the mass loss rate is higher then @xmath81 m@xmath9 yr@xmath79 . since @xmath82 @xcite , the very massive wind and the relatively weak magnetic field locates the alfvn surface of the known magnetic o - type stars close to the stellar surface ( @xmath83 r@xmath12 ) . in the case of single magnetic o - type stars , shocks originating in the wind channeled by the magnetic field can accelerate electrons up to relativistic energy @xcite .",
    "these , in turn , could emit at the radio regime by gyrosynchrotron mechanism . on the other hand",
    "the o - type stars are characterized by radio emission at centimeter wavelengths mainly ascribed to the thermal free - free emission from the ionized stellar wind , whose typical spectral index is @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) @xcite .",
    "the radio photosphere , at centimeter wavelengths , has a radius of @xmath86  r@xmath12 @xcite , meaning that the plasma of the wind is optically thick inside and that any non - thermal emission generated within is completely absorbed @xcite .",
    "the ecm from o - type stars , if any , would suffer from the same absorption effect .",
    "moreover , for a main sequence magnetic o - type star with stellar radius @xmath87 r@xmath9 , radiative wind mass loss rate @xmath88 m@xmath9 yr@xmath79 , terminal velocity @xmath89 km s@xmath79 and dipolar magnetic field with @xmath90  g , the condition @xmath91 is valid everywhere .",
    "this is a further consideration against the possibility that a magnetic o - type star can emit ecm pulse . up to now the signatures of non - thermal emission mechanism ,",
    "flat or negative spectral index and variability , in the o - type stars are observed only in multiple systems , the relativistic electrons origin is thus ascribed to the acceleration in the shocks that take place in the colliding winds far from the stellar surface @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the conditions for generation and propagation of the ecm emission are not satisfied for the known magnetic o - type stars .",
    "the behavior of the magnetized o - type stars is thus significantly different from the mcp stars ( b / a spectral type ) in the radio domain .",
    "the key to explain when the transition occurs is probably the shaping of the stellar magnetosphere , which depends on mass loss rate , magnetic field strength and rotational period .",
    "cuvir is up to now the only known magnetic chemically peculiar star presenting electron cyclotron maser emission .",
    "the characteristics of the mcp star @xmath0orie suggest that it should present the same phenomenology of cuvir at frequencies higher than 1.4 ghz .",
    "we have obtained multi frequencies radio observations during the whole the rotation period of @xmath0orie , in particular at the phases where the ecm is expected . however , no cyclotron maser emission has been detected in this star .",
    "there are indications that the magnetic field topology of @xmath0orie can not be considered as a simple dipole .",
    "the presence of the quadrupole field could inhibit the development of the conditions able to power the cyclotron maser emission .",
    "nevertheless , we can not rule out the possibility that the ecm could occur at other frequencies not analyzed in this paper , such as the 2.5 ghz , or at phases near the second null of the magnetic curve that are not fully covered .    on the other hand , to better understand the ecm in the wider context of plasma processes",
    "it will be extremely interesting to extend such investigation to a bigger sample of mcps .",
    "the average radio luminosity of the mcp stars is about @xmath92 [ ergs s@xmath79 hz@xmath79 ] @xcite ; it has been also shown that the radio luminosity of the mcp stars increases with the effective temperature @xcite .",
    "the radio interferometers of new generation , like the evla or the forthcoming australian ska pathfinder ( askap , which will operate at 1.4 ghz ) , will allow to reach the detection limit of few @xmath94jy in all sky deep surveys . assuming a threshold of 10 @xmath94jy we estimate in about 2000 pc the maximum distance within will be possible to detect the radio emission from the mcps .",
    "following @xcite we can assume the mcp stars uniformly distributed in space .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the number of radio detections will increase of about an order of magnitude , giving the opportunity to get a larger statistics of the physical conditions of the magnetospheres , like the magnetic field strength and orientation and the thermal plasma density , to correlate with the ecm .",
    "we want to stress here that this class of objects provides the unique possibility to study plasma process in stable magnetic structures , whose topologies are quite often well determined by several independent diagnostics @xcite , thus overcoming the variability of the magnetic field that is one of the major problem that prevents an accurate modeling of ecm in very active stars such dme or close binary systems . on the other side ,",
    "moving towards earlier spectral types , stronger and denser stellar winds together with a weaker magnetic field should inhibit the onset of the ecm instability .",
    "moreover , as shown for the prototype cuvir , the observations of persistent coherent pulses of ecm , which act as a clock of the star , in other mcp stars would offer a valuable tool for the angular momentum evolution of the objects belonging to this class .",
    "we thank the referee for his / her constructive criticism which enabled us to improve this paper .",
