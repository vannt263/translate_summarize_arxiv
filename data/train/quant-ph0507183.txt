    "complementarity is one of the most characteristic properties of quantum mechanics , which distinguishes the quantum world from the classical one . in 1927 , bohr@xcite first reviewed this subject , observing that the wave- and particle - like behaviors of a quantum mechanical object are mutually exclusive in a single experiment , and referred to this as complementarity .",
    "probably the most popular representation of bohr complementarity is the ` wave - particle duality'@xcite , which is closely related to the long - standing debate over the nature of light @xcite .",
    "this type of complementarity is often illustrated by means of two - way interferometers : a classical particle can take only one path , while a classical wave can pass through both paths and therefore display interference fringes when the two partial waves are recombined .",
    "depending on their state , quantum mechanical systems ( quantons ) can behave like particles ( go along a single path ) , like waves ( show interference ) , or remain in between these extreme cases by exhibiting particle- as well as wave - like behavior .",
    "this can be quantified by the predictability @xmath0 , which specifies the probability that the system will go along a specific path , and the visibility @xmath1 of the interference fringes after recombination of the two partial waves , which quantifies the wavelike behavior .",
    "a quantitative expression for the complementarity is the inequality @xcite @xmath2which states that the more particle - like a system behaves , the less pronounced the wave - like behavior becomes .    in composite systems , consisting of two ( or more )",
    "quantons , it is possible to optimize the which - way \" information of one particle : one first performs an ideal projective measurement on the second particle . by an appropriate choice of the measurement",
    "observable , one can then maximize the predictability for the first partial system .",
    "this optimized property , which is called distinguishability @xmath3 , obeys a similar inequality @xcite : @xmath4for pure states , the limiting equality holds , @xmath5while the inequality holds for mixed states .",
    "this issue has been experimentally investigated in the context of interferometric experiments , using a wide range of physical objects including photons@xcite , electrons@xcite , neutrons@xcite , atoms@xcite and nuclear spins in a bulk ensemble with nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques @xcite .    in systems of strongly correlated pairs of particles , it is often useful to consider particle pairs as composite particles with an independent identity .",
    "such composite particles that consist of identical particles include pairs of electrons ( cooper pairs ) and photon pairs@xcite .",
    "many interesting phenomena , such as superconductivity , are much easier to understand in terms of the composite particles than in terms of the individual particles .",
    "suitable experiments , such as two - photon interference @xcite can measure properties of the composite particles .",
    "these experiments made it possible to quantify the  compositeness \" of a two - particle state .",
    "extreme cases are product states , which show no signal in two - particle interference experiments , while maximally entangled states maximize the two - particle visibility but show vanishing visibility in experiments testing the interference of individual particles @xcite . between these extremes",

    ", @xmath7 is the single - particle visibility for particle @xmath8 , while @xmath9 represents the two - particle visibility .",
    "this intermediate regime of the complementarity relation of one- and two - photon interference has only recently been experimentally demonstrated in a young s double - slit experiment by abouraddy et al.@xcite .    from a quantum information theoretic point of view , composite quantum systems involve inevitably the concept of entanglement , which is a uniquely quantum resource with no classical counterpart . does entanglement constitute a physical feature of quantum systems that can be incorporated into the principle of complementarity ?",
    "some authors have explored this question and obtained some important results , such as the complementarities between distinguishability and entanglement@xcite , between coherence and entanglement@xcite and between local and nonlocal information@xcite etc . additionally , some complementarity relations in _ n_-qubit pure systems are also observed such as the relationships between multipartite entanglement and mixedness for special classes of _",
    "n_-qubit systems@xcite , and between the single particle properties and the _",
    "n _ bipartite entanglements in an arbitrary pure state of _ n _ qubitstessier .    more recently , jakob and bergou@xcite derived a generalized duality relation between bipartite and single partite properties for an arbitrary pure state of two qubits , which in some sense accounts for many previous results .",
    "they showed that an arbitrary normalized pure state @xmath10 of a two - qubit system satisfies the expressionjb : @xmath11here the concurrence @xmath12@xcite is defined by @xmath13as a measure of entanglement .",
    "@xmath14 is the y component of the pauli operator on qubit @xmath8 and @xmath15 is the complex conjugate of @xmath16 .",
    "the concurrence is a bipartite quantity , which quantifies quantum _ nonlocal _ correlations of the system and is taken as a measure of the _ bipartite _ character of the composite system .",
    "the complement @xmath17combines the single - particle fringe visibility @xmath18 and the predictability @xmath19 .",
    "this quantity is invariant under local unitary transformations ( though @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not ) , and is therefore taken as a quantitative measure of the _ single - particle _ character of qubit @xmath20 .",
    "since the two - particle visibility is equal to the concurrence , @xmath21 @xcite , we can rewrite eq .",

    ", we give a proof - of - principle experimental demonstration of the complementarities ( [ e.dvp ] ) , ( [ e.cvp ] ) and ( [ e.vvp ] ) in a two - qubit system .",

    "vi we generalize the complementarity relation ( [ e.cvp ] ) to multi - qubit systems .",
    "a quantitative complementarity relation exists between the single - particle property and the bipartite entanglement between the particle and the remainder of the system in pure multi - qubit systems .",
    "this allows us to derive , for pure three - qubit system , a relation between the single - particle , bipartite and tripartite properties , which should generalize to arbitrary pure states of @xmath31 qubit systems .",
    "finally , a brief summary with a discussion is given in sec .",
    "complementarity relations are often discussed in terms of photons or other particles propagating along different paths .",
    "another , very flexible approach is to simulate these systems in a quantum computer . in particular liquid - state nmr has proved very successful for such investigations .",
    "optical interferometers can readily be simulated by nmr - interferometry @xcite .",
    "figure [ nmr_int ] shows how such an interferometric experiment can be implemented by a sequence of radio - frequency pulses .",
    "assuming an ideal spin @xmath32 particle , the hilbert space @xmath33 associated with the particle is spanned by vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "a beam splitter , which puts the particle incoming from one port into a superposition of both paths is realized by a radio frequency pulse that puts the spin in a superposition of the two basis states .",
    "if the flip angle of the pulse is taken as @xmath36 , it corresponds to a _",

    "the amplitude of the resulting fid (= the integral of the spectrum ) measures then the populations : @xmath44where we have taken into account that the sum of the populations is unity .",
    "the experimental signal can be normalized to the signal of the system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "figure [ spectr ] shows , as an example , the interference pattern for the single proton spin in h@xmath45o .",

    "the complementarity relation ( [ v12s ] ) , together with the identity @xmath224 and the definition ( [ e.sk ] ) of the single particle character @xmath222 offers a method for quantifying entanglement in terms of the directly measurable quantities , in this case visibilities , predictability and distinguishability . in this section",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since there is no generalization of the 3-tangle to larger systems , we can only speculate here if it is possible to extend the relation ( [ e.123 ] ) to more than three qubits . on a heuristic basis , we consider two types of pure _ n_-qubit systems .",

    "currently , there is no general way to measure this form of entanglement beyond three qubits .",
    "the w states of table [ t.states ] may also be generalized to _",
    "n _ qubits as @xmath235 .",
    "these states exhibit the maximal bipartite entanglements and no other _ m_-way entanglements , i.e. , @xmath236 in these two cases the complementarity relation generalizes to @xmath237 .",
    "complementarity is a universal relationship between properties of quantum objects .",
    "however , it behaves in different ways for different quantum objects . the purpose of this paper was to analyze the different complementarity relations that exist in two- and multi - qubit systems and to illustrate some of them in a simple nmr system .",
    "we experimentally verified the complementarity relation between the single - particle and bipartite properties : @xmath238 in a pure two - qubit system . to determine the entanglement , we used either the two - particle visibility @xmath30 or the distinguishability @xmath26 and the predictability @xmath19 .",
    "accordingly , two complementarity relations : @xmath239 and @xmath186 were tested for different states including maximally entangled , separable , as well as partially entangled ( intermediate ) states .    furthermore , the complementarity @xmath238 between one- and two - particle character was generalized to systems of _ n _ qubits .",
    "the complementarity relation @xmath240 holds for an arbitrary pure _ n_-qubit state , which implies a tradeoff between the _ local _ single - particle property ( @xmath241 ) and the _ nonlocal _ bipartite entanglement between the particle and the remainder of the system ( @xmath242 ) .",
    "more interesting , in a pure three - qubit system , the single - particle character ( @xmath243 ) , the two - particle property regarding this particle measured by the sum of all pair - wise entanglements involving the particle ( @xmath244 ) , and the three - particle property measured by the _ genuine _",
    "tripartite entanglement ( @xmath245 ) are complementary , i.e. , @xmath246 .",
    "however , the generalization of the similar relationship to a larger - qubit system requires the identification and quantification of multi - partite entanglement for pure and mixed states beyond three - qubit systems that still remains an open question currently .",
    "a similar relationship can not be directly generalized to larger qubit systems .",
    "some specific samples might be helpful to conjecture the relation @xmath237 : the single - particle property ( _ local _ ) of a particle might be complementary to all possible _ pure _ multi - particle properties ( _ nonlocal _ ) connected to this particle .",
    "complementarity and entanglement are two important phenomena that characterize quantum mechanics . from these observations , we conclude that entanglement in its various forms is an important parameter for the different forms of complementarity relations in multi - partite systems .",
    "different forms of entanglement quantify the amount of information encoded in the different quantum correlations of the system , indicating the multi - partite quantum attributes .",
    "these results have also implications on the connection between entanglement sharing and complementarity and maybe in turn provide a possible way to study the entanglement in multi - partite quantum systems by complementarity .",
