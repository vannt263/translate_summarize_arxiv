    "charateristic numbers of curves in projective spaces is a classical problem in algebraic geometry : how many curves in @xmath1 of given degree and genus that pass through a general set of linear subspaces , and are tangent to a general set of hyperplanes ? presented in this form , the problem seems almost unattackable , as not much is known even in the case of genus two space curves .",
    "however , the cases of genus zero and genus one space curves are well understood .",
    "incidence - only ( meaning no tangency condition is considered ) characteristic numbers of rational plane curves were first computed by kontsevich , see @xcite .",
    "the method was to pull back the wdvv equation on @xmath2 onto the moduli space of stable maps @xmath3 to obtain a recursion counting rational plane curves .",
    "the same method works equally well for rational space curves . in @xcite , lemma @xmath4",
    ", it was shown that the tangency divisor is numerically equivalent to a linear combination of the incident divisor and boundary divisors on @xmath5 hence one can write down a recursion computing full characteristic numbers of rational space curves .    in genus one , there are at least two counting problems .",
    "one could try to obtain enumeration of genus one curves with generic @xmath6 invariant , or of genus one curves with fixed @xmath6 invariant .",
    "this note will deal with the latter .",

    ", we obtain an algebraic solution that works over any closed field of zero charactersistic , in contrast to the analytic method in @xcite and @xcite . the results in this note",
    "will also be used to compute characteristic numbers of elliptic space curves in an upcoming paper by the author .",
    "all the recursions are based on our algorithm counting rational two nodal reducible curves .",
    "these are projective curves having two rational smooth component intersecting at two points ( or with a choice of two intersection points in the case of plane curves ) . counting these curves",
    "is in turn based on an algorithm counting rational curves , now with an additional type of conditions : special tangent conditions .",
    "this will be defined in section @xmath7 .",
    "we work out in detail the algorithm counting rational curves with special tangent conditions in ambient space of dimension at most @xmath0 . for dimension @xmath8 or higher ,",
    "the numbers could in theory be expressed as intersections of tautological classes on a blowup of @xmath9 , but this is much less implementable .",

    "note that because in general a curve of degree @xmath13 will always intersect a hyperplane at @xmath13 points , introducing an incident condition with a hyperplane essentially means multiplying the cycle class cut out by other conditions by @xmath13 . for example , if we ask how many genus zero curves of degree @xmath31 in @xmath32 that pass through the constraint @xmath33 , that means we ask how many genus zero curves of degree @xmath31 pass through three lines , four points , are tangent to one hyperplane , and then multiply that answer by @xmath34 .",
