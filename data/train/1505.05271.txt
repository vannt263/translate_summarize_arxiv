    "the answer is yes .",
    "the effects are dramatic and surprising .",
    "consider the two dimensional ising model with a point defect .",
    "we focus on the variations , the difference between with and without the defect , of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "naively , one would expect the internal energy variation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy density of pure system and is a constant at the critical point .",
    "* however in our numerical calculation on a @xmath5 lattice , at the critical point the internal energy variation is proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "moreover the heat capacity variation is proportional to @xmath7 rather than @xmath6*. hence the defect makes an unexpectedly large contribution .    using renormalization group ( rg ) theory , we studied the influence of the defect on the thermodynamic quantities . due to the long range correlation near the critical point",
    ", the defect changes the energy density across the whole system .",
    "we find that the internal energy variation is an integration of energy correlation , which gives rise to the specific heat .",

    "consequently the heat capacity variation is proportional to the temperature derivative of specific heat of a pure system . with operator product expansion ( ope )",
    "@xcite and conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite , we show these conclusions for the two dimensional ising model explicitly",
    ". then we use the scaling theory and rg to extend to common critical systems .    to test the above conclusions , we study the two dimensional ising model on a finite size lattice with a site defect using bond propagation algorithm ( bpa ) @xcite . the variations induced by the defect of the free energy , internal energy and heat capacity are calculated .",
    "the bpa results verify the rg and scaling argument about the internal energy and heat capacity variation .",
    "in fact , the effect of defects on the critical phenomena has been studied 40 years ago @xcite .",
    "however those studies focused on the average effect of many defects rather than a single defect .",

    ", @xmath90 .",
    "if @xmath91 , the summation over the system gives rise to @xmath92 this is just the behaviour the specific heat of a pure system .",

    "the correlation between two scaling operators @xmath117 decays as @xmath118 in the limit of @xmath119 . for a critical system ,",
    "the most relevant operator are magnetic operator @xmath120 and thermal operators ( or energy operators ) @xmath121 .",
    "their eigenvalues are @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively and @xmath124 .",
    "the other scaling operators eigenvalues are negative and hence irrelevant .    in the expansion eq .",
    "( [ eq : ex-2 ] ) , the magnetic operator @xmath120 is prohibited because of symmetry .",
    "we may classify the scaling operators as being even or odd under the symmetry @xmath125 . in the expansion eq .",
    "( [ eq : ex-2 ] ) , the scaling operators @xmath126 must be even .",
    "besides the constant term , the first order term is the thermal operator @xmath127 .",
    "then , for the internal energy variation defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta - u ] ) , the leading term is a summation of energy correlator between the defect and other bonds .",
    "the correlator of thermal operators near the critical point behaves @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the correlation length exponent and @xmath130 .",
    "the correlators between thermal operator and other even scaling operators decays faster since the scaling dimension of other even operators are larger than thermal operator s .",
    "therefore at the critical point for a finite system with size @xmath7 and @xmath131 , the internal energy variation is given by @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the specific heat exponent , @xmath134 is a constant , @xmath135 is the logarithmic case . if @xmath136 , the constant term @xmath134 is negligible , and @xmath43 is divergent as @xmath137 .",
    "otherwise @xmath134 is the leading term and @xmath43 converges to @xmath134 as @xmath137 . for a finite system the specific heat at the critical point just scales as @xmath138 .",
    "for away from the critical point and @xmath139 , we have @xmath140 similarly if @xmath136 , the constant term @xmath141 is negligible , and @xmath43 is divergent as @xmath142 .",
    "otherwise @xmath141 is the leading term and @xmath43 converges to @xmath141 as @xmath142 . in this case @xmath43 has a cusp . as we know for a pure system the specific heat scales as @xmath143 near the critical point .",
    "therefore we have @xmath144 .    since @xmath145 ,",
    "it has @xmath146 for a finite system at the critical point @xcite @xmath147    the above argument is quite general except we assumed that the system is isotropic , i.e. the correlator only depends on the separation between two points .",
    "thus conclusions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u - scaling ] ) and ( [ eq : c - scaling ] ) are valid for common isotropic systems .",

    "1 , the boundary condition is open , i.e. , we have four edges and four corners . for this kind of geometry , bpa is very efficient @xcite .",
    "the sketch of bpa for this problem is also shown in fig.1 . to keep the defect be the centre of lattice",

    "we can avoid the trouble stemming from the asymmetry .",
