    "homogenization problems for periodic differential operators of mathematical physics are of significant interest both from theoretical point of view and for applications .",
    "a broad literature is devoted to homogenization problems . at the first place ,",
    "the books @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite should be mentioned .",
    "consider a typical homogenization problem .",
    "let @xmath16 be a family of operators in @xmath17 given by @xmath18 here @xmath19 is a positive definite and bounded @xmath20-matrix - valued function .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath19 is periodic with respect to some lattice @xmath21 .",
    "the problem is to study the behavior of the solution @xmath22 of the equation @xmath23 for small @xmath24 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath22 tends ( in some sense ) to @xmath25 as @xmath8 , where @xmath25 is the solution of the `` homogenized '' equation @xmath26 here @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a constant positive matrix called the _ effective matrix_. the operator @xmath29 is called the _ effective operator_. the character of convergence of @xmath22 to @xmath25 and error estimates are studied .    a possible approach to homogenization of periodic differential operators in @xmath30 consists in application of the floquet - bloch theory combining with methods of the analytic perturbation theory . in this connection ,",
    "we mention the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , a new operator - theoretic approach to homogenization problems",
    "was suggested and developed .",
    "it was also based on the floquet - bloch decomposition for a periodic operator and applying methods of the analytic perturbation theory .",
    "the main idea of this approach was to study a homogenization procedure as a spectral _ threshold effect _ at the bottom of the spectrum of a periodic elliptic operator .",
    "in particular , this approach allowed the authors to prove the following error estimate : @xmath31 see @xcite .",
    "this estimate is order - sharp and the constant @xmath32 is well controlled .",
    "estimate ( [ 0.4 ] ) means that the resolvent @xmath33 tends to @xmath34 in the operator @xmath35-norm , and @xmath36 such estimates are called `` operator error estimates '' ; they were obtained in @xcite for a wide class of matrix periodic differential operators .",
    "let us briefly discuss the method of the proof of estimate ( [ 0.5 ] ) . by the scaling transformation , ( [ 0.5 ] ) is equivalent to the estimate @xmath37 here @xmath38 .",
    "the bottom of the spectrum of @xmath39 is the point @xmath40 .",
    "it is natural that the behavior of the resolvent @xmath41 can be described in terms of the threshold characteristics of @xmath39 ( i.  e. , the spectral characteristics at the bottom of the spectrum ) .",
    "applying the floquet - bloch theory , we decompose @xmath39 in the direct integral of operators @xmath42 acting in @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the cell of the lattice @xmath45 .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is called a _ quasimomentum_. the operator @xmath42 is given by the differential expression @xmath47 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "estimate ( [ 0.6 ] ) is equivalent to the estimate @xmath48 which must be uniform in @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath50 is the brillouin zone of the dual lattice @xmath51 .",
    "the main part of investigation is the study of the operator family @xmath42 by means of the analytic perturbation theory . a crucial role is played by the _",
    "spectral germ _ of the operator family @xmath42 at @xmath52 .",
    "the spectral germ is a finite rank selfadjoint operator which is defined in terms of the threshold characteristics of @xmath39 .",
    "it is possible to find a finite rank approximation for the resolvent @xmath53 for small @xmath24 in terms of the spectral germ .",
    "next , it turns out that the family @xmath54 corresponding to the effective operator _ has the same spectral germ _ as the family @xmath42 .",
    "this allows one to pass from approximation in terms of the germ to approximation in terms of the effective operator .",
    "along with operators whose coefficients are periodic in all directions , it is interesting to study operators with coefficients that are periodic only in part of variables .",
    "such problems are important for applications , in particular , in the theory of waveguides . in these problems , the coefficients of the effective operator depend on the `` nonperiodic '' variables , while homogenization is related to the `` periodic '' variables .",
    "technically , the study of such problems is more difficult than the study of operators with coefficients that are periodic in all directions .    in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the following elliptic operator in a strip @xmath55 was considered : @xmath56 the coefficients @xmath57 were assumed to be positive definite , bounded and 1-periodic in @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , it was assumed that @xmath57 are periodic lipschitz functions with respect to @xmath12 . on the boundary @xmath58",
    ", periodic boundary conditions were posed .",
    "it was shown that there exists an `` effective operator '' @xmath59 ( also with periodic boundary conditions on @xmath58 ) such that @xmath60 as before , the scaling transformation is used and the floquet decomposition ( in @xmath4 ) is applied .",
    "the quasimomentum @xmath61 is one - dimensional .",
    "then the problem reduces to the study of the operator family @xmath62 acting in @xmath43 , where @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 is given by the expression @xmath65 and @xmath66 ; the boundary conditions are periodic in both variables .",
    "the method of @xcite can be applied to the operator @xmath67 `` layerwise '' .",
    "this allows to introduce the spectral germ for the family @xmath67 and to obtain approximation for @xmath67 in terms of the germ .",
    "main technical difficulties are related to adding the _ unbounded _ `` perturbation '' term @xmath68 to @xmath67 and approximating the operator @xmath69 .      in the present paper ,",
    "we study an elliptic operator @xmath70 acting in @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath3 are assumed to be bounded , lipschitz in @xmath12 , positive definite and @xmath71-periodic in @xmath4 .",
    "next , let @xmath72 be a positive definite and bounded function in @xmath73 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath14 is 1-periodic in @xmath4 and lipschitz in @xmath12 .",
    "we denote @xmath74 .    _",
    "our main goal _ is to find an approximation in the operator norm in @xmath10 for the _ generalized resolvent _",
    "@xmath7 of the operator ( [ 0.9 ] ) .",
    "we construct the effective operator @xmath75 with the effective coefficients depending only on @xmath12 ( see ( [ 1.11 ] ) , ( [ 1.12 ] ) ) . by @xmath76",
    "we denote the mean value of @xmath5 in @xmath4 .",
    "the _ main result _ of the paper is the following estimate @xmath77 by the scaling transformation , the question is reduced to the study of the operator family @xmath78 , where the operator @xmath79 contains small factor @xmath80 standing at the second order operator @xmath81 .",
    "this is the main difficulty .",
    "we apply the floquet - bloch decomposition ( in @xmath4 ) and decompose the operator ( [ 0.11 ] ) in the direct integral of operators @xmath82 acting in @xmath43 . now",
    "the domain @xmath44 is _ unbounded _ : @xmath83 .",
    "the operator @xmath84 is given by the expression @xmath85 with periodic boundary conditions on @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "we apply method of @xcite to the operator @xmath84 `` layerwise '' ( for each fixed @xmath12 ) , and define the spectral germ of the family @xmath84 at @xmath88 .",
    "now the germ is not a finite rank operator .",
    "it is possible to approximate the part of @xmath84 near the bottom of the spectrum in terms of the germ .",
    "main difficulties are related to taking the term @xmath89 into account .",
    "the essential differences of the problem studied here from the problem studied before in @xcite is that @xmath44 is _ unbounded _ domain and that we study the _",
    "generalized _ resolvent of @xmath90 ( instead of the ordinary resolvent ) .",
    "we develop some technical tools suggested in @xcite and adapt them for the case of unbounded domain @xmath44 and generalized resolvent .",
    "main results can be generalized for the case of arbitrary dimension without any new technical difficulties .",
    "we give formulations of the corresponding results ( see section [ sect11 ] ) . in the main exposition",
    ", we consider the case @xmath91 only for the sake of simplicity and clearness .",
    "our general result can be applied to homogenization of the schrdinger operator with a singular potential periodic in one direction and non - periodic in another direction ; see section [ sect10 ] .",
    "this operator arises in the model of a `` soft waveguide '' ( the spectral properties of such operators were studied in @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that for application to the schrdinger operator we need to study in advance a generalized resolvent of @xmath90 ( but not the ordinary resolvent ) .      in section [ sect1 ] ,",
    "we give the precise statement of the problem and formulate the main result ( theorem 1 ) . in section [ sect2 ] , using the scaling transformation and the floquet - bloch decomposition we reduce the problem to the study of the generalized resolvent @xmath92 of the operator ( [ 0.12 ] ) . in section [ sect3 ] , the operator family @xmath84 is studied by using method of @xcite ; the spectral germ of @xmath84 is introduced . in section [ sect4 ] ,",
