    "nowadays all the prediction of the standard model ( sm ) have been experimentally tested and are in agreement with the model s predictions at a given order in perturbation theory . however , there are reasons for expecting the existence of new particles . among others ,",
    "the existence of dark matter  @xcite and the neutrino masses  @xcite need , for their implementation in any model , particles that do not belong to the degrees of freedom in the sm .",
    "these new particles , if any , can be observed by the direct search at colliders like the lhc , or by their effects on rare decays that are suppressed , by several reasons , in the sm  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the rare @xmath3 decay has been recently observed at cern  @xcite with a branching ratio compatible with the sm model prediction .",
    "almost all the extensions of the electroweak standard model ( esm ) have a rich scalar sector .",
    "some of them introduce new quarks and/or leptons along with neutral and charged extra scalars and vector bosons .",
    "all these cases occur in models whose gauge symmetry is larger than the sm symmetries , in particular in the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 model ( m331 as shorthand )  @xcite , and in the 3 - 3 - 1 model with heavy leptons ( 331hl )  @xcite . moreover , the extra neutral vector ( generically denoted by @xmath4 ) and scalar bosons induce flavor changing neutral  currents ( fcncs ) processes at tree level which are supposed to be the dominant extra contributions ( besides that of the sm ) . in 331 models , as in many extensions of the sm , such processes are induced by neutral ( pseudo ) scalars and , since the discovery of a spin-0 resonance with mass 125 gev  @xcite , it is mandatory to take its effects into account .",
    "the fcnc at the tree level were revisited in the context of the m331 model  @xcite for two reasons : firstly , usually when considering the @xmath4 phenomenology in this model , the contributions of the ( pseudo)scalars are neglected  @xcite . secondly , as we said before , the scalar sector of any model beyond the sm ( bsm ) must contain a scalar field with the mass around 125 gev and diagonal couplings compatible , within the experimental error , with those of the esm higgs boson at least with the third quark generation .",
    "however , generally this esm - like higgs scalar also mediate fcnc at tree level and its effects have to be computed .",
    "see for instance  @xcite . from the experimental point of view , the cms has reported measured of @xmath5 which is 2.5@xmath6 different from zero  @xcite . recall that in the esm , fcnc processes occur only at the 1-loop level  @xcite .    the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite establish that in @xmath7 fcnc processes , when the @xmath8 even sm - like neutral higgs boson and one of the @xmath8 odd scalars are considered , there are positive and negative interference among these fields and the @xmath4 in such a way that the previous constraints on the mass of the @xmath4 boson are avoided . for instance , the measured value of strange and bottom mesons , @xmath9 , a lower limit @xmath10  tev is still possible and is also compatible with the constraints coming from weak decays .",
    "depending on the values of the unitary matrices in the neutral scalar and pseudo - scalar sectors , even lower values may be allowed .",
    "the value of the lower limit for the @xmath4 mass depends not only on the projections of the neutral scalars over the sm - like higgs but also on the unitary matrices which rotate quarks and leptons symmetry eigenstates to the respective mass eigenstates , @xmath11 .",
    "numerical values for the latter matrices were obtained in  @xcite .",
    "this reduces the number of free parameters in the model .",
    "in fact , the only free parameters remaining are the unitary matrices that diagonalize the scalar mass matrices .",
    "these results are valid in the m331 and in 331hl models since both have the same quark content .",
    "however the scalar mass spectra are different in both models , the former needs a scalar sextet for generating the charged leptons masses , and the later one does not .    here",
    "we will concentrate only in the 331hl model .",
    "our results are valid in the m331 when the sextet is avoided and the charged lepton masses need the contributions of a dimension five operator built with two triplets  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the entries of the matrices @xmath11 obtained in  @xcite are not unique and different solutions imply different phenomenology .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was reasonable to consider only the tree level amplitudes because certainly these are the main extra contributions to the @xmath7 processes in the m331 model and in addition , these amplitudes involve only the @xmath4 , neutral scalars and pseudo - scalars . however , there are also 1-loop diagrams , for instance boxes and penguin , which include not only the neutral scalar and vector bosons , but all the particle spectrum of the model : exotic charged quarks , singly and double charged scalar and vector bosons .",
    "accordingly , we have to evaluate their effects in order to see if there is , or not , some values of the parameters of the model in which the constraints on the mass of @xmath4 obtained at tree level are not spoiled by 1-loop corrections .",
    "hence , it is necessary to quantify the effects of all these particles in fcnc processes and this is the aim of the present paper .",
