    "for any low - scale leptogenesis scenario one can distinguish at least 3 epochs depending on whether the temperature is below or above the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) critical temperature @xmath7  gev and the sphaleron decoupling temperature @xmath6  gev .",
    "it is a good approximation to assume that the decoupling of the sphalerons is instantaneous , i.e.  above @xmath8 the sphalerons are deeply in thermal equilibrium whereas below they do not occur .",
    "the effect of ewsb , instead , is more progressive . for the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm scalar field we consider @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , as a result of the sm crossover @xcite .",
    "below @xmath11 we should consider the decays into rh neutrinos and leptons of the @xmath12 physical states , rather than of the higgs doublet .",
    "however , for the creation of the baryon asymmetry this is relevant only for @xmath13 , where these 4 states have approximately the same ( thermal contribution included ) masses .",
    "thus , for simplicity in the following we will consider instead the decay of the full scalar doublet with the 4 states having the mass of the higgs boson , which at @xmath14 is @xmath15  gev .",
    "for the various particles , in particular the electroweak lepton doublet @xmath16 , the masses are approximately given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the vev - dependent zero - temperature mass .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 can be found e.g.  in ref .",
    "note that , given the small values of the rh neutrino yukawa couplings at low scale , the thermal corrections are negligible for the masses of the rh neutrinos , but not necessarily for their mass splitting when they are quasi - degenerate , see below .",
    "for the thermal mass of the higgs doublet @xmath20 , instead , we will consider the result that is obtained from the second derivative of the thermal effective potential , as given e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinem_decays ] the regions in the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane in which the two different decay processes are active is shown . for the moment",
    ", we work in the approximation of only one rh neutrino .",
    "taking into account thermal masses , the decay widths for the processes @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "we calculate the thermally - averaged decay rates @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the classical - statistics approximation , finding @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the total decay rate is thus given by @xmath31 .",
    "in the low-@xmath22 region the @xmath32 rate receives @xmath33 corrections  @xcite due to ir - enhanced processes involving electroweak bosons  @xcite .",
    "the way the @xmath34 decays lead to a cp - asymmetry is from the one loop self - energy diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .",
    "clearly this diagram does not lead to any cp - violation at @xmath14 , because the loop can not have an absorptive contribution for @xmath35 .",
    "however , it does from thermal corrections , since one of the particles in the loop can originate on - shell from the thermal bath . denominating by @xmath36 the thermal cut of the self - energy , one obtains , for @xmath37 , the usual resonant  @xcite form for the unflavoured l - violating cp asymmetry @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39/(|y_n y_n^\\dagger|_{11}|y_ny_n^\\dagger|_{22})$ ] and @xmath40 is the mass splitting including thermal corrections @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "here we have conservatively taken the regulating expression in the denominator to be equal to the same @xmath36 as in the numerator .",
    "this is based on the physical expectation that the divergence in the degenerate limit is regulated by the ( thermal ) width of the heavy neutrinos .",
    "notice that corrections to the precise form of the asymmetry ( e.g. taking into account heavy - neutrino oscillations at @xmath43 in addition to mixing @xcite ) can be absorbed into a re - definition of @xmath44 . as shown in detail in @xcite , the masses appearing in the numerator of should be taken as the lagrangian masses without thermal corrections , @xmath45 .",
    "this also guarantees the vanishing of the asymmetry in the cp - conserving limit @xmath46 .",
    "the thermal cut of the majorana rh neutrino self - energy has been calculated in @xcite . here",
    ", neglecting the thermal motion of the decaying particle , we use the results of @xcite , obtained in the kadanoff - baym formalism ( which corresponds to taking the cut of the _ retarded _ self - energy , rather than of the time - ordered one , as done instead in @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath47 can be extracted as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is @xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 the 4-momenta of the charged lepton and rh neutrino , respectively . the absorptive function @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 where the momentum and statistical factor are @xmath55 , @xmath56 for rh neutrino decay , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 for @xmath59 decay ( with @xmath60 the corresponding bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution ) , and @xmath61 denoting the phase - space integration .",
    "thus , @xmath62 for both decays are as given in appendix d of @xcite except that for @xmath59 decay we find that the @xmath63 term in @xmath64 in @xcite must be multiplied by @xmath65 .",
    "thus the asymmetry takes on the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "the boltzmann equations for the rh neutrino and the lepton asymmetry , including the effect of the processes discussed above , are @xcite @xmath68 \\;,\\\\",

    "take into account additional important washout terms , which are active also when the decay processes are kinematically forbidden . for them",
    "we adopt the results and the notations of  @xcite , where they are calculated including the leading thermal effects .",
    "the final asymmetry produced in this way depends on 5 parameters : @xmath22 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath44 and the effective neutrino mass @xmath74 .",
    "at first sight one could believe that the boltzmann equations above do not lead to a lower bound on the mass of the rh neutrino , since the lower is @xmath22 , the larger is the phase space available for the @xmath76 decay to occur .",
    "however , there exists one . here , the out - of - equilibrium sakharov condition is not realized as usual from the fact that the decaying particle is not in thermal equilibrium ( here it is ) but from the fact that the rh neutrino in the decay product is not .",
    "thus , for @xmath77 , the lower @xmath22 , the more @xmath75 is in thermal equilibrium at @xmath78 , the less successful is leptogenesis .",
    "starting from a rh neutrino initially in equilibrium , fig .",
    "[ fig : bound ] shows the results we get from solving the boltzmann equations  - , by taking @xmath79 when one of the two decay processes is kinematically allowed , zero otherwise . taking the maximal cp - asymmetry @xmath80 , ( the factor of 2 is to take into account the fact that such a maximal cp asymmetry is obtained in the quasi - degenerate case together with a second rh neutrino )",
    ", we obtain the bound @xmath81 .",
    "of course one could wonder if this bound can be saturated , i.e.  if taking @xmath82 can be justified . although @xmath83 can not be satisfied at all temperatures , see  , since the bound occurs for @xmath84 much larger than the usual thermal - equilibrium critical value @xmath85 , the asymmetry in this case depends mostly on @xmath86 at temperatures close to @xmath87 .",
    "thus , we find that taking @xmath88 can be justified in a large portion of the parameter space in fig .  [",
    "fig : bound ] . however , this is not fully the case for the low-@xmath22 region . the full asymmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq : asym2 ] ) ( including in particular the @xmath72 factor ) turns out to be maximized for @xmath89 . for such values of @xmath44 , since @xmath90 , for @xmath91 the thermal - mass contribution in the denominator of are important .",
    "thus , for @xmath21 close to @xmath8 , the asymmetry is maximized for @xmath92 , which gives @xmath93 this excludes the area below the thick blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bound ] , yielding to a bound one order of magnitude stronger @xmath94 this bound can be compared to the much larger one that we get by considering only @xmath95 decays , which turns out to be @xmath96 ( as one could approximately guess from fig .",
    "[ fig : kinem_decays ] ) .",
    "note also that possible flavor effects , disregarded above , do not sizeably change this bound because in the low-@xmath22 region , where the bound occurs , even if @xmath97 , it turns out that there is no large washout effects diminishing the asymmetry produced , due to the sphaleron cut .",
    "as explained above , the bound of eq .",
    "( [ absolutebound ] ) holds for leptogenesis induced by cp - violating h - decays if the rh neutrinos previously thermalize . the fact that it is in general difficult to achieve leptogenesis at such low scale , at the origin of this bound , is easy to understand : the lower the masses , the more the rh neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium at @xmath98",
    "however , this is true only if one assumes that the n species has thermalized before the lepton asymmetry is produced .",
    "if instead the rh neutrinos have not thermalized the situation drastically changes .",
    "this can be easily the case as long as there were no other interactions below the reheating temperature ( such as involving a @xmath99 for instance ) .",
    "for low @xmath22 the production of the asymmetry is cut off at @xmath100 .",
    "therefore the less @xmath75 thermalizes , the smaller is @xmath101 , the fewer inverse @xmath59 decays occur ( unlike @xmath59 decays which occur anyway ) , the larger is @xmath102 , the larger is the l - asymmetry produced .",
    "note that this is different from what happens for large @xmath103 , where considering a situation with no @xmath75 after reheating renders leptogenesis more difficult  @xcite . in this case , in the weak washout regime ,",
    "as the asymmetry is produced long before sphaleron decoupling , the more @xmath75 there are in the thermal bath , the more @xmath75 decays occur to produce the l asymmetry at @xmath43 .",
    "[ fig : empty ] shows the numerical solution of the boltzmann equations , by starting from a zero number density of rh neutrinos at @xmath104 and taking a maximal cp - asymmetry @xmath82 ( multiplied by 2 as above ) .",
    "clearly this shows that , even for @xmath105  gev , the parameter space available is large and successful leptogenesis can be achieved with cp - asymmetry far from maximal . note that here most of the asymmetry is created shortly before sphaleron decoupling because for @xmath106 and small @xmath75 number density , the source term in is approximately constant : @xmath107 , since @xmath108 in this regime .",
    "thus , the final asymmetry produced does not depend on the reheating temperature as long as this is larger than @xmath8 by a factor of about 2 .    in figs .  [",
    "fig : dm11]-[fig : dm5 ] we plot the @xmath109 numerical solution of the boltzmann equations , with the asymmetry as given in , with zero number density of rh neutrinos at @xmath104 , and taking @xmath110 respectively . fig .",
    "[ fig : dm8 ] and  [ fig : dm5 ] show that successful leptogenesis , which requires @xmath111 , can be achieved with level of @xmath75 mass quasi - degeneracy about two orders of magnitude smaller than in ordinary tev - scale resonant leptogenesis  @xcite . for @xmath112 , we find that the minimum level of mass - degeneracy required is about @xmath113 . in the flavoured ( total - lepton - number conserving ) mechanism considered in  @xcite with 3 rh neutrinos , which does not require @xmath75 mass degeneracy ( and occurs at @xmath114 ) , a comparable level of fine - tuning is instead present in the yukawa couplings to guarantee @xmath115 , as required by the flavour effects taking place .",
    "we may also compare the mechanism considered here with the ars oscillation one  @xcite ( which also relies on non - thermalized @xmath75 , but with cp - violation given by n oscillations ) in the @xmath116 scenario considered in @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "a mass degeneracy between 2 rh neutrinos of about @xmath117 is needed to generate both the observed asymmetry ( e.g.  at  @xmath118 ) via the ars mechanism and the dark matter relic density at @xmath119 , via @xmath75 freezeout or decay .",
    "the approximate form of the asymmetry at @xmath120 generated by the ars mechanism in this regime can be found in  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : dm11 ] shows that , assuming maximal cp - phases for both mechanisms , the asymmetry at @xmath8 generated for @xmath117 is about 7 ( 12 ) times larger than the ars one , for @xmath121 ( or larger if the reheating temperature is larger than @xmath8 but smaller than the typical @xmath118 ars asymmetry production temperature ) .",
    "note that such a dominance of the asymmetry produced by h decays slightly before the sphalerons decouple does not hold for all the available parameter space @xcite .",
    "notice also that , although the l - violating effects inducing the baryon asymmetry here can in principle be captured by the density - matrix formalism used to study the ars mechanism ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) , these have been so far thought to be negligible and hence disregarded .",
    "a remarkable feature of the framework considered in this letter is that , along it , leptogenesis is testable ! this is shown in all figures 3 - 5 , which give the actual excluded @xmath22-@xmath84 regions from various experiments , together with future expected sensitivities for @xmath75 production at ship and fcc - ee , see e.g.  @xcite",
    ". also shown is the lower bound on @xmath22 obtained from requiring that the decay of @xmath75 occurs before bbn .",
    "clearly , for @xmath22 around gev the available parameter space will be largely probed , with possibilities up to @xmath122  gev .",
    "note also that , as fig .",
    "[ fig : empty ] suggests , if it was not for the bbn bound , leptogenesis from @xmath59 decays could be successful for values of @xmath22 smaller than considered here @xcite . for @xmath123",
    "we find that leptogenesis can be successful for @xmath22 as low as @xmath124  mev .",
    "to sum up , the leptogenesis from higgs decay mechanism proposed here is particularly efficient at low scale , based on the 3 following ingredients .",
    "first it is based on the fact that , at low scale , thermal effects induce l - violating cp - violation in the decays of the sm scalar doublet into a rh neutrino and a lepton .",
    "second it satisfies the out - of - equilibrium sakharov condition from the fact that the rh neutrinos in the decay product ( rather than the decaying particles ) are out - of - equilibrium .",
    "third , it assumes that the @xmath75 species has not thermalized before producing the l asymmetry , which boosts the asymmetry production .",
