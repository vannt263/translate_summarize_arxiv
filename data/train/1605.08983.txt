    "<S> one , two , or three stable solitons emerge in a well - defined form , unlike the recently studied 1d setting , where the picture is obscured by radiation jets . </S>",

    "<S> considerable work has been done on the dynamics of aws in media with cubic @xcite-@xcite and quadratic ( @xmath1 ) ady-3wave-@xcite nonlinearities , including generation of solitons by aws , and the 2d propagation in a @xmath1 medium 2dexperimentchi2 . </S>",
    "<S> most works dealing with the @xmath1 nonlinearity addressed the _ upconversion _ scenario , i.e. , the aw was launched in the fundamental - frequency ( ff ) component , generating the second - harmonic ( sh ) wave @xcite-@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> viz_. , the single - color aws and two - color solitons .    </S>",
    "<S> the objective of the present work , suggested by the stability of fundamental 2d @xmath1 solitons @xcite-@xcite ( the first reported @xmath2 solitons were two - dimensional @xcite ) , is to establish such a link in 2d , via the spontaneous downconversion of two - dimensional aws . </S>",
    "<S> the results are essentially cleaner \" than in the 1d case , i.e. , emerging solitons are well pronounced , with no conspicuous radiation features or irregularities obscuring the picture . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the downconversion of the input in the form of an aw vortex , which is another single - color eigenmode in 2d . in accordance with the fact that @xmath1 vortex solitons are unstable @xcite-@xcite </S>",

    "<S> it is shown below that the aw structure of the input , driving self - stretching of the field , prevents approaching the quasi - collapse in the @xmath28 system , and thus facilitates the creation of one or several solitons ( a similar trend was reported in the cubic nls equation @xcite ) .    </S>",

    "<S> the outcome does not depend on a particular realization of the random seed , which is explained by the fact that the system selects an eigenmode of the parametric instability from the random perturbation . in agreement with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nls ] ) , solitons were not found at @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are reported for @xmath33 , the respective fwhm width of the input in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions being @xmath36 ; otherwise , the necessary integration domain is too large , and the respective spatial area of the experimental realization may also be too large .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](a , b ) display its typical 2d slice projected onto the @xmath38 and @xmath39 planes . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , the number of the solitons increases with @xmath40 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) . at @xmath41 , </S>",
    "<S> the results are simple in terms of @xmath42 : two , one , and no solitons are generated , respectively , at @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 in fig . [ fig1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> three solitons can be generated at very small @xmath42 ( this case is not shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , the single soliton emerging in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] traps the share of the initial total power ( [ p ] ) which is @xmath55 , the rest being spent on the generation of small - amplitude radiation ( see also fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3 ] , respective shares of the initial total power are @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the figures display self - trapping of the originally diffuse fields , via transient oscillations , into quasi - stationary 2d solitons . </S>",
    "<S> trajectories of the emerging solitons are  clearly seen too . </S>",
    "<S> note that , when the single soliton is generated , it moves in the same direction in which the self - bending aw , initiated by input ( [ initial ] ) , would move as the eigenmode of the linear sh  equation . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] two solitons move in opposite directions , although the self - bending direction determined by the aw input remains dominant . </S>",
    "<S> it was checked that the simulations keep zero value of total momentum ( [ m ] ) , in accordance with the fact that it is zero for input ( [ initial ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ w ] ) , the generation of three solitons by the aw input ( [ initial ] ) requires very small values of @xmath42 and , accordingly , a very broad simulation domain . </S>",
    "<S> the creation of multiple solitons is facilitated by taking @xmath31 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> fig4 , where an additional weak soliton appears between two stronger ones . in this case , two emerging solitons move in the direction determined by the aw input , while the third ( left ) soliton moves backwards .    unlike the 1d setting considered in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where relatively strong radiation jets \" were generated , in addition to solitons , making the overall picture rather messy , in the 2d system the radiation field does not form conspicuous features , allowing the solitons to emerge in a clean form , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] , where rhombus data points show the relative intensity of the ff radiation field outside of the soliton s cores . </S>",
    "<S> the result is less clean in the case when two solitons are created , as the radiation field has a higher amplitude between them .    </S>",
    "<S> an essential characteristic of the emerging set of solitons is the share of total power ( [ p ] ) carried away by each one . </S>",
    "<S> for the cases when one or two solitons are generated , the corresponding results are summarized in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] ( in the region shown in the figure , three solitons do not emerge , but results for the three - soliton set created at @xmath48 are mentioned above , with each soliton s power share close to @xmath64 ) . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , the shares decrease with the increase of truncation parameter @xmath18 in input ( [ initial ] ) , as the total power grows , roughly , @xmath65 , as per eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ power ] ) , while parameters of the emerging solitons weakly depend on @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the creation of the solitons is also characterized by the conversion efficiency , quantified in fig . [ fig5 ] by the share of the total power which is kept by the sh component of the wave field .    , and phase distributions for the input in the form of the airy vortex , given by eq . </S>",

    "<S> the bottom panel displays the trajectory of the single fundamental soliton into which the vortex is converted.,width=288 ]    we also ran systematic simulations for the transformation of the airy vortex , generated by input @xmath68where @xmath69 is the truncated factorized aw in eq . </S>",

    "<S> a typical example of the vortex input and its evolution is displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the mode quickly loses its vorticity and transforms into a single fundamental soliton , moving in the positive @xmath34 direction . </S>",
    "<S> in the case shown in fig . [ fig6 ] , the total input power ( [ power ] ) is @xmath72 , the emerging soliton carrying away its share @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the power is scattered in the form of small - amplitude radiation , which also absorbs the entire angular momentum of the initial vortex .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have explored the scenario of the downconversion of aws ( airy waves ) in the 2d @xmath1medium , which is initiated by random perturbations amplified by the parametric instability of the aws and airy vortices in the sh component . </S>",
    "<S> the spontaneous downconversion generates one or more stable fundamental solitons in the clean \" form , unlike the 1d setting , where the picture is complicated by radiation jets . </S>",
    "<S> a challenging possibility is to extend the analysis to 3d , where the @xmath1 nonlinearity supports stable spatiotemporal solitons @xcite-@xcite , that may be generated by the 3d instability of quasi-2d solitons @xcite . </S>"
