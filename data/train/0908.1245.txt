    "ultrashort pulse characterization  @xcite is a key technology underpinning much of ultrafast science .",
    "progress in the field continues to occur on many fronts  extending the range of measurable pulse parameters , such as duration , wavelength , and complexity , improving the sensitivity and single - shot capability , and providing spatial , in addition to temporal , resolution .",
    "less easily quantified but equally important issues are precision , robustness , ease of use and the diagnosis , identification and quantification of errors .",
    "innovations on this front have included simplified geometrical setups  @xcite , theoretical analysis of the influence of various errors  @xcite , and the exploitation of redundant data to identify misalignment or violations of the assumptions on the pulse properties  @xcite .",
    "spectral shearing interferometry ( ssi ) , a popular class of techniques whose best - known example is spectral phase interferometry for direct electric field reconstruction ( spider )  @xcite is widely used for its efficient and direct retrieval acquisition and computation requirements , which scale linearly with the time - bandwidth product of the unknown pulse , and its natural suitability to broadband optical input .",
    "its direct retrieval formula makes analysis of the influence of various errors a straightforward matter and its one dimensional data encoding makes the acquisition of multiple shots , and subsequent analysis of their shot - to - shot variations , convenient and rapid .",
    "geometrically simplified arrangements have also been developed  @xcite .",
    "the common feature of all ssi techniques is the interference of two spectrally sheared replicas of the unknown pulse .",
    "this introduces two parameters , the shear and the interferometric reference phase , both of which must be calibrated to a precision which increases with the time - bandwidth product of the unknown pulse .",
    "novel geometries for the convenient determination of these parameters  @xcite are therefore of interest , supplementing the well - established techniques  @xcite .",
    "additionally , whilst typical raw ssi data contains some redundant information  @xcite enabling self - consistency checking , this can be supplemented by taking several measurements at different shears which should result in identical retrieved fields .",
    "most currently known spider variants  @xcite are implemented as single shear devices .",
    "changing the shear involves moving parts which requires additional calibration and prevents single shot multiple shear operation .",
    "a significant recent development in this context is chirped ancillae arrangement- ( car-)spider  @xcite , in which an upconverted replica of the unknown pulse with spatially varying frequency is produced through the phasematching properties of a long crystal .",
    "this replica is split , and two - dimensional spectral interferometry is performed between itself and a laterally inverted copy , yielding an interferogram in which the shear varies with position .",
    "the zero - shear line encodes the reference phase , whilst the shear calibration can be performed by blocking each arm individually .",
    "car - spider is therefore an attractive device in the light of the previous discussion .",
    "however , the collinear long - crystal geometry limits both the measureable bandwidth and the range of pulse lengths .",
    "also in the long - crystal arrangement the spatial carrier of the interferogram depends on frequency , requiring an additional calibration for broadband pulses .    in this paper",
    ", we present a device which we dub spatially encoded arrangement for car - spider ( sea - car - spider ) , in which spatially chirped ancillae are produced by a diffraction grating and split before undergoing upconversion with the test pulse .",
    "this removes the restriction on the pulse parameters imposed by the long - crystal geometry and also renders the spatial carrier independent of frequency , so that the reference phase is truly self - calibrated .",
    "furthermore , the arrangement permits a convenient determination of all calibration parameters in a single step with much greater precision than car - spider , as well as a direct verification of the ancillae monochromaticity which is important for accurate measurement of long pulses .",
    "the test pulse @xmath0 $ ] , propagating along the @xmath1-axis , undergoes sum - frequency generation with two spatially chirped ancillae , one of which has been laterally inverted about the @xmath2-axis , so that their local frequency is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the upconversion frequency common to both ancillae at @xmath5 .",
    "the ancillae wavevectors also form an angle @xmath6 in the @xmath7-@xmath1-plane , symmetrically about the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the resulting interferogram , re - imaged onto two - dimensional spectrometer , is of the form @xmath8",
    "@xmath9)i(\\omega-\\alpha x)}\\exp \\left [ i \\gamma(\\omega , x ) \\right]\\ ] ] @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the positive - spatial - frequency ac sideband with spatial carrier @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the interferogram phase , and @xmath14 is the zero - shear calibration phase , which is theoretically zero due to symmetry but may be present due to imperfect imaging .",
    "note that the spatial carrier @xmath15 is independent of the signal frequency @xmath16 because the spatial tilt is applied to the ancillae , rather than the upconverted replica as in car - spider . at all @xmath7-positions @xmath17 ,",
    "the interferogram phase contains the finite differences @xmath18 i.e. spectral shearing interferometry data of shear @xmath19 .    the reconstruction procedure is as follows : the phase - gradient @xmath13 , contained in the ac sideband at spatial frequency @xmath12 , is extracted by 2d fourier filtering , as with sea - spider  @xcite",
    ". then the calibration phase must be determined .",
    "if the spectrum has no nulls , then @xmath13 is well defined along @xmath20 and @xmath14 can be obtained directly at this position and subtracted from @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in the case of spectral nulls at @xmath5 , or for increased precision , the calibration phase can also be obtained by weighted averaging along the @xmath7 axis .",
    "we use the fact that , except for the calibration phase , @xmath13 is an odd function about @xmath5 .",
    "therefore by averaging accross a symmetric interval about @xmath5 the calibration phase can be isolated . in practice",
    "this requires a method , which is robust against @xmath21 phase discontinuities .",
    "we use @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the principal value of the argument and @xmath24 denotes a one - dimensional phase unwrapping routine which removes @xmath21 discontinuities .    after subtracting the calibration phase ,",
    "the standard concatenation procedure can be performed at any @xmath7 as desired .",
    "the spectral amplitude of the unknown pulse , modulated by the phasematching efficiency and the spectrometer response , is also obtained from the @xmath5 signal .",
    "therefore , all data is recorded near the upconversion frequency , enabling a specificially optimized spectrometer to be used . even though a single sea - car - spidergram contains tens of independent datasets ,",
    "online reconstruction of each of these is still possible owing to the fast algebraic reconstruction algorithm of spider .",
    "we note that as with filter - spider  @xcite and car - spider , our new device does not rely on temporal stretching of the ancillae to ensure the quasi - monochromaticity .",
    "thus in sea - car - spider , which is free from the pulse length restrictions of the long - crystal arrangement , strongly chirped pulses can be characterized without the need for correction of the reconstructed phase  @xcite .",
    "the spatial carrier in sea - car - spider enables an intuitive interpretation of the fringe pattern , because , as we now show , the fringe contours follow the phase derivative of the unknown pulse .",
    "let @xmath25 be a fringe contour , defined by @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath27}{{\\mathrm{d}}\\omega}=    \\frac{\\partial \\gamma[\\omega , x{\\textsubscript{con}}(\\omega)]}{\\partial \\omega } +    \\frac{\\partial \\gamma[\\omega , x{\\textsubscript{con}}(\\omega)]}{\\partial x }   \\frac{\\partial x{\\textsubscript{con}}(\\omega)}{\\partial \\omega}=0.\\ ] ] in  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) we approximate the finite differences with a derivative , and write @xmath28 the spatial derivative is @xmath29 the second term on the right hand side of represents the spatial carrier and is much larger than the first term  otherwise the sidebands would not be distinct in the fourier domain .",
    "we neglect the first term and substitute ( [ eq : derivative2 ] ) into ( [ eq : fringecontourdef ] ) , yielding @xmath30 therefore the fringe contours follow the spectral phase gradient scaled by the local shear and the inverse of the spatial carrier .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : seacartracestheory ] , which shows calculated traces for a transform - limited pulse and for pulses with quadratic , cubic and quartic polynomial spectral phases .",
    "note that for a transform - limited pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : seacartracestheory ]  ( a ) ) the fringe contours are flat , reflecting the frequency independence of the spatial carrier .",
    "the fringe pattern provides a simple and useful visual tool for aligning a laser qualitatively without the need for running a reconstruction algorithm .",

    "the delay - line dl1 is only for coarse adjustment of the delay between ancillae and test pulse and only requires initial adjustment .",
    "the ancillae are prepared as follows : the reflected beam from bs1 is dispersed by a grating of pitch @xmath33{mm^{-1}}$ ] and angle of incidence @xmath34{^{\\circ}}$ ] .",
    "the spherical lens l1 is positioned one focal length @xmath35{mm}$ ] away from the grating and the crystal is mounted @xmath36 further downstream . between the lens and the crystal the ancilla beam",
    "is split at 50/50 beamsplitter bs2 and one arm is spatially inverted .",
    "the coarse delay line dl2 is used to achieve temporal overlap between the ancillae and needs no subsequent adjustment .",

    "after spatial filtering ( sf ) the sum - frequency beams are re - imaged onto a 2d imaging spectrometer by lens l2 with focal length @xmath42{mm}$ ] .",
    "the spectrometer s entrance slit is oriented in the dispersion plane of the ancillae and the signal is internally dispersed perpendicular to this plane .",
    "the spectrometer provides astigmatism - free imaging over wide spectral and spatial extent  @xcite .",
    "the signal is recorded with a @xmath43{pixel}$ ] cmos detector with adc resolution .",
    "single shot data is recorded at a rate of limited by memory and data - transfer capacities .",
    "it should be noted that sea - car - spider can be operated as zero additional phase ( zap ) device by using a cylindrical mirror and reflection of the test - pulse off bs1 rather than transmission .",
    "in order to obtain a single - step calibration of the shear slope @xmath44 , as well as the central upconversion frequency @xmath4 and the @xmath7-origin , the tp arm was blocked and the spatial filter sf temporarily removed . in this configuration , the second harmonic of the ancillae , as well as their sum - frequency signal , are obtained .",
    "[ fig : calibration](a ) shows the calibration data obtained from the average of 50 single shot acquisitions .",
    "a linear fit of the slopes of the two ancillae provides @xmath45{mrad / fs / mm}$ ] . from the crossing point of the two ancillae the @xmath7-origin and @xmath4",
    "are obtained .",
    "we determine the @xmath7-origin to be pixel @xmath46 .",
    "the upconversion frequency is found to be @xmath47{rad",
    "all errors are estimated using the covariances of the individual fit parameters for both ancillae .",
    "the sum - frequency mixing between the ancillae appears as the vertical line at frequency @xmath4 in fig .  [ fig : calibration](a ) .",
    "its position with respect to the crossing point is a useful check of the axial alignment of the crystal - to - spectrometer reimaging system .",
    "if l2 is correctly relay imaging the crystal plane to the spectrometer entrance slit , then all three lines cross at the same point .",
    "the spectral width of the ancillae can also be obtained from the calibration data of fig .",
    "[ fig : calibration](a ) .",
    "this is useful in verifying that the ancillae are sufficiently monochromatic , a basic requirement of spectral shearing interferometry . in the case of sea - car - spider , where many shears are available",
    ", the spectral width of the ancillae determines the minimum shear from which a meaningful reconstruction can be performed . here",
    ", we obtain a monochromaticity of @xmath48{mrad / fs}$ ] fwhm ( in the second harmonic or @xmath49{mrad / fs}$ ] ( in the fundamental ) , granting a maximal time window for test pulses of @xmath50{ps}$ ] .",
    "the ancillae spectral width is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the fwhm spot size produced by lens l1 .",
    "the monochromaticity can therefore be further increased by using a higher pitched grating and a tighter focus .",
    "we note that a similar calibration procedure was performed in the original car - spider arrangement . however , because the upconversion was performed using the asymmetric phasematching in a long crystal it is impossible to block the test pulse and hence the shear calibration was performed using the upconverted signal pulses .",
    "as we now illustrate , the sea - car - spider procedure offers greater precision because the second harmonics of the ancillae are much more narrowband than the test pulse . in car - spider",
    ", the calibration would be obtained by recording the individual signals separately and obtaining their displacement by cross - correlation , disregarding regions of low intensity .",
    "one such fit is shown in fig .",

    "our device preserves vertical symmetry ( @xmath2-axis in our coordinate system ) and relay images all beams .",
    "it turns out that beam - pointing and displacement changes in the vertical direction do not affect the device calibration .",
    "vertical beam pointing fluctuations cause the signal to move off the slit reducing the signal intensity .",
    "horizontal beam displacements cause a change in the spatial carrier , which does not affect the calibration or reconstruction .",
    "a beam - pointing change @xmath55 in the horizontal plane causes the two spatially chirped ancilla fields to move into opposite directions due to the lateral inversion in the ancilla preparation setup .",
    "this leads to a shift in the upconversion frequency of @xmath56 to first order , whilst the zero shear position is not affected .",
    "due to the low ( near normal ) diffraction angle from the grating the variation of the shear slope @xmath44 is negligible .",
    "we tested these conclusions by recording 50 single shot calibration traces and determining the calibration parameters shear slope @xmath44 , zero shear row and upconversion frequency @xmath4 as shown in figure  [ fig : calmultishots ] . confirming our findings we find that @xmath44 , and the @xmath7-origin are constant within the uncertainty of our fits .",
