    "conditional independence is an important concept in many calculi for dealing with knowledge and uncertainty in artificial intelligence .",
    "the notion plays a fundamental role for learning and reasoning in probabilistic systems which are successfully employed in areas such as computer vision , computational biology , and robotics .",
    "hence , new theoretical findings and algorithmic improvements have the potential to impact many fields of research .",
    "a central issue for reasoning about conditional independence is the _ probabilistic conditional independence implication problem _ , that is , to decide whether a ci statement is entailed by a set of other ci statements relative to the class of discrete probability measures . while it remains open whether this problem is decidable , it is known that there exists no finite , sound and complete inference system ( studen  @xcite ) .",
    "however , there exist finite sound inference systems that have attracted special interest .",
    "the most prominent is the _ semi - graphoid _ axiom system which was introduced as a set of sound inference rules relative to the class of discrete probability measures ( pearl  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main contributions of this paper is to extend the semi - graphoids to a _",
    "finite _ inference system , denoted by @xmath0 , which we will show to be ( 1 ) sound and complete for saturated ci statements , ( 2 ) complete for general ci statements , and ( 3 ) sound and complete for stable ci statements ( de waal and van der gaag  @xcite ) , all relative to the class of discrete probability measures .",
    "= -1 the techniques we use to obtain these results are made possible through the introduction of a _ lattice - theoretic framework_. in this approach , semi - lattices are associated with conditional independence statements , and @xmath0 is shown to be sound and complete relative to certain inclusion relationships on these semi - lattices . to make the connection between this framework and the conditional independence implication problem ,",
    "we first link the latter to an addition - based version of the problem . in particular , we introduce the _ additive implication problem _ for ci statements relative to certain classes of real - valued functions and specify properties of these classes that guarantee soundness and completeness , respectively , of @xmath0 for the implication problem . through the concept of _ multi - information functions _ induced by probability measures ( studen  @xcite ) , we link the additive implication problem for this class of functions to the probabilistic ci implication problem . the combination of the lattice - inclusion techniques and the completeness result for conditional independence statements allows us to derive criteria that can be used to falsify instances of the implication problem .",
    "we show experimentally that these criteria , some of which can be tested for in polynomial time , work very effectively , and we relate the experimental results to those obtained from a _ racing algorithm _ introduced by bouckaert and studen  @xcite .",
    "we define ci statements and introduce the finite inference system @xmath0 for reasoning about the conditional independence implication problem .",
