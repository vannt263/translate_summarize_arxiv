    "why should we study final - state interactions ( fsis ) in charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays seriously and urgently ?",
    "it is largely to do with the recent observation of direct @xmath2 violation .",
    "a first confirmed observation of direct @xmath2 partial rate asymmetry in charmless @xmath0 decays was established recently in @xmath3 by babar @xcite and belle.@xcite the combined babar and belle measurements of @xmath4 imply a @xmath5 direct asymmetry in the @xmath6 mode.@xcite as for direct violation in @xmath7 , a 5.2@xmath8 effect was claimed by belle,@xcite but it has not been confirmed by babar.@xcite    table 1 shows comparison of the model predictions of direct asymmetries with the world averages of experimental results.@xcite it appears that qcd factorization predictions@xcite for direct violation seem not consistent with experiment , whereas pqcd results @xcite are in the right ballpark . recalling that sizable strong phases can be induced from the annihilation diagram in the pqcd approach by introducing the parton s transverse momentum ,",
    "this means that we have to explore the fsi rescattering phases seriously in qcd factorization which are unlikely to be small possibly causing large compound @xmath2-violating partial rate asymmetries in aforementioned charmless decay modes .",
    "the sizable asymmetry observed in @xmath9 decays is a strong indication for large direct violation driven by long - distance rescattering effects .",
    "besides the above - mentioned violation , there exist some other hints at large fsi effects in the @xmath0 physics sector ; see @xcite for details .",
    "based on the regge approach , donoghue _",
    "et al._@xcite have reached the interesting conclusion that fsis do not disappear in the heavy quark limit and soft fsi phases are dominated by inelastic scattering , contrary to the common wisdom .",
    "a few years later , it was pointed out by beneke _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite within the framework of qcd factorization that the above conclusion holds only for individual rescattering amplitudes . when summing over all possible intermediate states , there exist systematic cancellations in the heavy quark limit so that the strong phases must vanish in the limit of @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the fsi phase is generally of order @xmath11 . in reality , because the @xmath12 quark mass is not very large and far from being infinity , the aforementioned cancellation may not occur or may not be very effective for the finite @xmath0 mass",
    ". moreover , the strong phase arising from power corrections can be in principle very sizable .",
    "therefore , we will model fsis as rescattering processes of some intermediate two - body states with one particle exchange in the @xmath13-channel and compute the absorptive part via the optical theorem.@xcite    the calculations of hadronic diagrams for fsis involve many theoretical uncertainties . since the one particle exchange in the @xmath13 channel is off shell and since final state particles are hard , form factors or cutoffs must be introduced to the strong vertices to render the calculation meaningful in perturbation theory . as we do not have first - principles calculations for form factors , we shall use the measured rates to fix the unknown cutoff parameters and then use them to predict direct violation .",
    "the results are shown in the last column of table 1 .",
    "we see that direct @xmath2-violating partial rate asymmetries in @xmath14 , @xmath6 and @xmath15 modes are significantly affected by final - state rescattering and their signs are different from that predicted by the short - distance approach .",
    "it is worth stressing a subtle point for @xmath16 decays .",
    "the rescattering charming penguins in @xmath17 are suppressed relative to that in @xmath18 modes as the former are cabibbo suppressed .",
    "consequently , charming penguins are not adequate to explain the @xmath17 data : the predicted @xmath15 ( @xmath19 ) is too large whereas @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is too small .",
    "this means that a dispersive contribution is needed to interfere destructively with @xmath15 so that @xmath15 will be suppressed while @xmath20 will get enhanced .",
    "this contribution can not arise from the charming penguins or otherwise it will also contribute to @xmath18 significantly and destroy all the nice predictions for @xmath18 . in the topological diagrammatic",
    "approach,@xcite this dispersive term comes from the so - called vertical @xmath22-loop diagram @xmath23 in which meson annihilation such as @xmath24 occurs .",
    "for @xmath25 decays with @xmath26 being a light vector meson , it is expected that they are dominated by longitudinal polarization states and respect the scaling law : @xmath27 .",
    "however , a low value of the longitudinal fraction @xmath28 in @xmath29 decays was observed by both babar @xcite and belle @xcite .",
    "this polarization anomaly poses an interesting challenge for any theoretical interpretation.@xcite    since the scaling law is valid only at short distances , one can try to circumvent it by considering the long - distance rescattering contributions from intermediate states @xmath30 .",
    "the large transverse polarization induced from @xmath31 will be propagated to @xmath29 via fsi rescattering .",
    "furthermore , rescattering from @xmath32 or @xmath33 will contribute only to the @xmath34 amplitude .",
    "recently , we have studied fsi effects on @xmath35 .",
    "while the longitudinal polarization fraction can be reduced significantly from short - distance predictions due to such fsi effects , no sizable perpendicular polarization is found owing mainly to the large cancellations occurring in the processes @xmath36 and @xmath37 and this can be understood as a consequence of and su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "our result is different from a recent similar study in @xcite . to fully account for the polarization anomaly ( especially the perpendicular polarization )",
    "observed in @xmath38 , fsi from other states or other mechanism , e.g. the penguin - induced annihilation , may have to be invoked .",
    "the same fsi mechanism will also induce sizable transverse polarization in @xmath39 decays .",
    "we found that @xmath40 is reduced to about 60% which is consistent with data for @xmath41 but not for @xmath42 .",
    "this should be clarified experimentally .",
    "i am grateful to chun - khiang chua and amarjit soni for very fruitful collaboration ."
