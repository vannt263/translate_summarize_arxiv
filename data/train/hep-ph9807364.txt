    "[ d - k ] up to order @xmath377 and taking @xmath108 , we find that the terms proportional to @xmath151 are only dominant up to times of order @xmath378 , or @xmath379 .",
    "( notice that @xmath380 can only be different from zero if the @xmath27 mixing phase is also different from zero @xcite , or if there is some strong phase involved @xcite . )",
    "this confirms the result that we had guessed just by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "we conclude that , for times @xmath247 larger than about @xmath381 , the effect of @xmath151 will be at most of order 1% .",
    "we have developed the formalism needed to study the most general cascade decays of the type @xmath0 , which involve two neutral meson systems , @xmath4 and @xmath1 , in succession .",
    "the resulting decay rates exhibit the usual sources of cp violation : cpv in the mixing of neutral meson systems , probed by @xmath78 ; cpv present directly in the decays , detected by @xmath79 ; and the cpv in the interference between the mixing in the initial neutral meson system , @xmath81 , and the decay _ from that system _ into the final state @xmath3 , measured by @xmath80 ( which is proportional to @xmath82 when @xmath3 is a cp eigenstate ) .",
    "but , when both the @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays are allowed , we find a new class of rephasing - invariant parameters , @xmath8 , that measure the interference between the mixing in the @xmath30 system and the decay from the initial state ( @xmath46 and @xmath48 ) _ into that system_.    we have applied this formalism to a variety of cases .",
    "the main results are the following .",
    "the proposal by meca and silva @xcite to detect new physics in @xmath151 through the decays @xmath196_d k^+$ ] may be extended to the @xmath182 and @xmath183 decays , which have much larger branching ratios . as we saw in eqs .",
    "[ not so obvious ] , there are two interference effects that probe @xmath151 .",
    "if we neglect the strong phase differences , one is proportional to a possible cp - violating phase in the @xmath27 mixing due to new physics",
    ". this effect might be easier to detect with the new decays proposed here than it was in the original meca and silva proposal .",
    "the other interference effect exists even in the absence of new cp - violating phases in @xmath27 mixing , and it involves the ckm phase @xmath162 .",
    "when the branching ratios and suppression factors are taken into account , this effect comes into the new decays at roughly the same level as it does in @xmath143 decays .",
    "next , we showed that the mixing in the @xmath285 system implies that the same @xmath151 effects are much less important in the @xmath382 and @xmath280 ( unless one could apply a very stringent time cut on the @xmath11 decays ) .",
    "the same applies to @xmath383 decays .",
    "similarly , @xmath384 decays can not be used to get a handle on @xmath151 unless one were able to perform a very stringent time cut on @xmath247 .    on the other hand , if we neglect the @xmath27 mixing , any @xmath385_d [ f]_k$ ] decay chain ( which would normally depend on three time variables , @xmath262 , @xmath316 , and @xmath247 )",
    "may be analyzed as a decay chain of the type @xmath386_k$ ] .",
    "these chains can also be studied with the formalism developed in this article .",
    "the most interesting case is @xmath387 . in principle , this could be used to get at @xmath15 in the same way as proposed by azimov and dunietz with the @xmath14_k$ ] decay chains .",
    "we thank c.  meca for discussions on related subjects , and l.  lavoura for this and for reading and criticizing the manuscript .",
