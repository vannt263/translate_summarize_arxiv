    "weak scale supersymmetry provides a nice solution to the naturalness problem and a predictive framework for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it also successfully predicts gauge couplings unification at a scale of @xmath2 gev thereby providing support for the idea that the standard model is embedded in a grand unified theory ( gut ) @xcite .",
    "recently , arkani - hamed and dimopoulos proposed that naturalness may not be a good criterion for determining weak scale physics @xcite .",
    "instead , they proposed that the higgs mass is fine - tuned and looked for alternative motivations for supersymmetry not tied to naturalness .",
    "giudice and romanino investigated this possibility further and found that the mssm with heavy scalar superpartners and light fermionic superpartners emerged naturally by demanding gauge coupling unification and a viable dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "this framework is known as split supersymmetry ( split - susy ) and further phenomenological consequences and string theory realizations have been worked out in @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the issue of gauge coupling unification and the embedding of split - susy in a viable gut model .",
    "we focus on orbifold gut models with a single extra dimension because these provide a particularly nice solution to many of the standard problems with 4d guts and a calculable framework for high - scale threshold corrections @xcite . in the simplest 4d supersymmetric su(5 ) guts , the prediction for the strong coupling constant at the scale @xmath3 is @xmath4 @xcite , somewhat larger than the experimentally measured value of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one of the important aspects of split - susy is a prediction for @xmath0 that is smaller than in 4d gut scenarios . likewise ,",
    "one of the important features of orbifold guts is the presence of threshold corrections to gauge couplings coming from heavy kk states that can improve the agreement between the predicted value of @xmath0 and experiment .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to show how the competing effects on @xmath0 from split - susy and 5d orbifold gut thresholds constrain the structure of generic orbifold guts .",
    "contrary to the findings of previous authors @xcite that bulk higgs fields are preferred for gauge coupling unification in low - energy susy models , we find that brane localized higgs fields are naturally preferred in the split - susy scenario .",
    "this result is attractive for several reasons .",
    "first , if the higgs fields live on a brane , then the simplest possibility of just having the mssm or sm higgs doublets can be realized @xcite .",
    "moreover , brane higgs scenarios are readily compatible with inherently 4d mechanisms of electro - weak symmetry breaking .",
    "of course , we do lose a few nice features with brane higgs doublets such as unified quark - lepton mass relations and charge quantization , but in any case su(5 ) quark - lepton mass relations for the first two generations are seemingly inconsistent with experiment .",
    "our paper is outlined as follows . in section 2",
    ", we ll review the framework of orbifold guts with extra dimensions .",
    "although the findings of our analysis will apply quite generally , we ll focus on the class of models developed in @xcite to illustrate the important features of orbifold guts with split - susy . in section 3",
    ", we ll discuss the effects of raising the susy breaking scale above @xmath3 as well as the competing effects of heavy kk state thresholds .",
    "in section 4 , we ll present the results of our two - loop analysis of gauge coupling unification and our findings for the favored range of the susy breaking scale and the location of the higgs fields in an orbifold gut completion .",
    "we then end with concluding remarks .",
    "among the many successes of 4d susy guts is the explanation for charge quantization and the pattern of quark and lepton quantum number , a prediction for gauge coupling unification close to experimental bounds , quark - lepton mass relations that reduce the number of flavor parameters in the standard model , and a robust framework for generating small nonzero majorana neutrino masses .",
    "however , important issues remain unresolved in these models .",
    "chief among these is the predicted rate of proton decay from colored higgsino exchange that essentially excludes the simplest su(5 ) guts .",
    "other problems include the origin of su(5 ) breaking , the very large splitting in mass required between the higgs colored triplet states and weak doublets , the fact that the observed quark / lepton mass relations for the lighter generations violate generic gut relations , and little explanation for the other flavor hierarchies of the standard model .",
    "gut models with extra dimensions offer several possible resolutions to these problems . as in @xcite",
    ", one can construct a 5d or higher dimensional model with su(5 ) gauge symmetry and break the symmetry down to @xmath6 on 4d branes using boundary conditions .",
    "for example , in 5d orbifold theories , orbifold fixed points serve as the branes on which the sm fields can live .",
    "the boundary conditions emerge as a consequence of requiring the fields to transform with definite parity under the orbifold group .",
    "with such a setup , the quark and lepton families and higgs of the standard model can be added to either the bulk or to the branes .",
    "the low energy effective theory consists of the lightest states in the kk expansion of fields .",
    "what should we require of the low energy theory ?",
    "in our case , we want to recover the mssm at low energy .",
    "all of the su(5 ) triplet states should be heavy , and proton decay should be suppressed to experimentally acceptable levels . to see how these requirements can be naturally satisfied in a higher dimensional gut ,",
    "let s consider the specific model developed in @xcite .",
    "not only does this model illustrate the important features of higher dimensional guts , but we will use this model to concretely study gauge coupling unification with split - susy later .      based on @xcite , the model we ll consider contains a single extra dimension @xmath7 orbifolded under the discrete reflection @xmath8 and combined translation and reflection @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 has two orbifold fixed points ( orbifold branes ) located at @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radius of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the bulk theory has 5d n=1 susy so that there is a natural way to obtain 4d n=1 susy on the orbifold branes .",
    "su(5 ) gauge fields are taken to reside in the bulk so that boundary conditions can break the symmetry down to @xmath6 on at least one of the two orbifold branes .",
    "thus , bulk gauge fields reside in a 5d n=1 susy vector multiplet , @xmath14 , consisting of a 4d n=1 susy vector multiplet @xmath15 and chiral multiplet @xmath16 transforming in the adjoint of su(5 ) .",
    "matter fields can reside either in the bulk or on the branes .",
    "bulk matter fields reside in 5d n=1 susy hypermultiplets , @xmath17 , consisting of 4d n=1 susy chiral and anti - chiral multiplets @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .    under the orbifold actions , the constituent multiplets transform with definite parity . to preserve a single n=1 susy in the zero mode spectrum",
    ", the gauge fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 are given @xmath20 parities of @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "bulk hypermultiplet constituents @xmath18 and @xmath19 are given parities @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "@xmath23 acts on the fundamental of su(5 ) as @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , there can be extra factors of @xmath25 for bulk hypermultiplets .",
    "the above parity assignments lead to boundary conditions on the fields at the orbifold fixed points , @xmath26 where the superscript @xmath27 refers to the parity under the su(5 ) breaking action of @xmath23 . at @xmath11",
    ", we see that bulk 5d n=1 ( 4d n=2 ) susy has been broken down to 4d n=1 by @xmath20 , but su(5 ) is still operative . at @xmath28 ,",
    "the bulk susy has been broken down to 4d n=1 and su(5 ) has been broken with only @xmath6 surviving .",
    "a single generation of standard model fermions can live in the bulk if they reside in two hypermultiplets transforming in the * 10 * , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and two in the @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . with the choice @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the zero modes of these four hypermultiplets fill out a single generation of standard model fermions .",
    "there is also the possibility of part of a generation living on an orbifold brane with the remainder in the bulk .",
    "for example , @xmath36 and @xmath37 can come from a 4d n=1 susy @xmath31 multiplet living on a brane while the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 components come from two * 10*s in the bulk .",
    "if the higgs fields arise from the bulk , they can come from two bulk hypermultiplets transforming in the * 5 * and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "another possibility is for the higgs to arise from a vector multiplet .",
    "for example , higgs fields with the correct quantum numbers can come from the doublet components of the adjoint of su(6 ) under its @xmath6 decomposition .",
    "6d orbifold models with this feature have been constructed in @xcite . of course",
    ", the higgs can also be a brane field @xcite .",
    "having introduced the orbifold gut framework , we can see how the problems of standard 4d susy guts can be resolved .",
    "the higgs doublet - triplet splitting problem is solved by requiring boundary conditions that eliminate the triplet zero mode .",
    "the higgs triplet states are now naturally heavy with mass of order , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the scale of the extra dimension .",
    "we also have the possibility of placing higgs fields on the 4d su(5 ) violating brane in which case there are not necessarily any triplet partners to begin with .",
    "yukawa couplings of bulk hypermultiplets are forbidden by 5d supersymmetry and so the yukawa couplings reside on the branes .",
    "thus , if the higgs is in the bulk , then proton decay from dimension five triplet higgsino exchange via dirac mass terms is eliminated by the bulk supersymmetry .",
    "additional dangerous sources of proton decay can be eliminated by using the bulk su(2)@xmath43 symmetry that comes from the n=2 4d susy of the 5d bulk @xcite .",
    "su(5 ) mass relations can be preserved for the heaviest generation by placing it on the su(5 ) brane at @xmath11 .",
    "if the first two generations are placed in the bulk , then their masses will not respect su(5 ) relations because the down - type quarks and charged leptons have different yukawa couplings to the higgs field for our choice of representation .",
    "moreover , because the bulk fields are spread out in the extra dimension , wave - function suppression will naturally make their masses smaller thereby explaining why heavy matter fields satisfy su(5 ) mass relations while light matter does not .",
    "gauge coupling unification can proceed as usual except now there will be radiative corrections coming from kk modes and brane localized gauge kinetic operators that do not respect the bulk su(5 ) . as long as the extra dimension is large compared to the unification scale , then the bulk gauge kinetic operators will dominate over brane localized operators by a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "of course , this assumes that we can reliably estimate the couplings to be of comparable strength at some scale .",
    "we will later identify the unification scale with the scale of strong coupling for the 5d theory thereby justifying this assumption .    in this paper , we will also briefly consider 6d so(10 ) orbifold guts .",
    "so(10 ) orbifold guts on @xmath45 have been constructed and their features discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "other 6d orbifold guts with unified gauge group su(6 ) have been constructed that contain higgs doublets arising from bulk gauge fields @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "the primary impact on gauge coupling unification that 6d models introduce consists of different power law scaling of couplings above the scale @xmath46 than in 5d models .",
    "as will be made explicit in section 3 , the primary effect of a sixth dimension will be to decrease the overall magnitude of the contribution to @xmath47 from kk thresholds .",
    "in this section , we discuss gauge coupling unification in split - susy .",
    "we start by considering the experimentally measured values , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 @xcite . given @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ", we can obtain a prediction for @xmath0 assuming unification at a high scale .",
    "a one - loop analysis of this prediction will give a prediction for @xmath0 with errors dominated by the large su(3 ) coupling of order @xmath53 .",
    "however , the experimental uncertainty is of order @xmath54 , so a full two - loop analysis with one - loop thresholds is needed to reliably compare theory with experiment .",
    "the easiest way to calculate gauge coupling predictions is to use a succession of effective field theories ( efts ) obtained by integrating out heavy particles at the appropriate mass scales @xcite . in this way",
    ", we can use a simple mass independent renormalization scheme such as @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 if we re working with susy ) in each effective theory .",
    "the effects of large log contributions at lower energies coming from massive states is absorbed into the matching conditions between the theories .",
    "assuming that the gauge couplings are unified at a scale @xmath57 , the evolution of the coupling down to @xmath3 proceeds in two steps .",
    "in the first step , the tower of kk modes contribute at one - loop to the gauge couplings above the compactification scale @xmath46 . from the 5d perspective ,",
    "the theory is not renormalizable which is reflected by the mass dimension of the 5d gauge coupling .",
    "thus , we expect power - law scaling of the gauge couplings between the gut scale @xmath57 and @xmath46 . in the second step , the gauge couplings run in the usual logarithmic fashion from @xmath46 to @xmath3 .    for clarity ,",
    "we start by discussing the familiar logarithmic running and matching below the scale @xmath46 . after studying the one - loop effects of lifting the susy breaking scale @xmath58",

    "( [ alphadifferencec ] ) and ( [ deltakkresults ] ) , we can see that the effects of non - universal gut scale running and increasing @xmath58 both lower @xmath0 and consequently disfavor split - susy with bulk hypermultiplet higgs fields .",

    "this problem is less severe for the 6d so(10 ) model where the bulk vector multiplet higgs case requires at least @xmath185 gev and heavy gauginos and higgsinos to not be disfavored . so in this case ,",
    "the preferred susy breaking scale coincides with the compactification scale .",
    "the split - susy scenario offers an interesting new framework for beyond the standard model physics .",
    "not motivated by naturalness as in the mssm , unification becomes one of the central motivations for this scenario .",
    "higher dimensional orbifold guts offer a particularly compelling unification framework in which many of the standard problems of susy guts can be overcome . in this spirit , we incorporated split - susy into a 5d su(5 ) orbifold gut .",
    "the primary constraint on these models is a successful prediction of low energy gauge couplings . in generic orbifold gut models ,",
    "non - universal running above the compactification scale alters the low energy unification prediction of @xmath0 .",
    "the magnitude and sign of these contributions depends primarily on the bulk geography of the higgs fields . on the other hand ,",
    "lifting the scale of supersymmetry breaking lowers the unification prediction for @xmath0 .",
    "our one- and two - loop analysis of gauge coupling unification shows that split - susy favors brane higgs fields and relatively high scales of susy breaking of order @xmath1 gev .",
