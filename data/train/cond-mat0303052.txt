    "vi ) finally we mention effects caused by surfaces or imperfections , which break the lattice translational symmetry .    despite a large body of literature @xcite ,",
    "many questions in this area have remained open .",
    "our aim here is to study some new qualitative aspects primarily in connection with the first two points listed above . for that purpose",
    "we consider fcc @xmath0type alloys ( such as cu@xmath1au , cu@xmath1pd etc . ) that display an ordered @xmath5structure . a class of models is considered which includes chemical interactions on the fcc ",
    "lattice up to second neighbors .",
    "our main result will be to demonstrate a gradual changeover from an anomalously slow growth with an effective exponent @xmath3 to conventional growth , characterized by @xmath6 , when the second neighbor interactions are increased from zero .",
    "results will be interpreted in terms of properties of low  energy or type ",
    "i domain walls , whose energy vanishes as the second  neighbor interactions are switched off .",
    "consider an fcc  lattice , where each site i can be occupied by an @xmath7-atom , a @xmath8-atom or a vacancy ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "occupation numbers thus satisfy @xmath10 .",
    "their averages over all sites are chosen in accord with stoichiometric @xmath0 alloys , @xmath11 .",
    "the average vacancy concentration @xmath12 is taken small enough so that static properties are unaffected by the vacancies . for nn ",
    "sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 interactions are taken as in our previous work @xcite , @xmath15 ; @xmath16 . on the other hand , for nnn  sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 we assume @xmath17 ; @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "the above model displays a 4-fold degenerate ground state corresponding to the ideal @xmath5structure .",
    "this structure is described by a 4component order parameter @xcite , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 refers to the @xmath22concentration , while @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 describe a succession of @xmath8-rich and @xmath8depleted atomic layers along the @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28direction , respectively .",
    "ordered domains are of the type @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "a sign  change of @xmath23 along the @xmath26direction implies a high  energy type  ii domain wall . along the @xmath27 or @xmath28direction",
    "a sign change of @xmath23 can be effected without braking nearest  neighbor bonds , and creates a low  energy type ",
    "its energy solely results from nnn  interactions and therefore is zero if @xmath31 .    in our monte carlo simulations we employ the atom ",
    "vacancy exchange algorithm .",
    "the ordering temperature @xmath32 and the temperature for spinodal ordering @xmath33 are deduced from simulations as in @xcite . at @xmath34",
    "we have @xmath35 , while @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 increase nearly linearly with @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 at @xmath40 .",
    "typical domain patterns observed after a sudden quench from infinite temperature to a final temperature @xmath41 are shown in figs .",
    "1a , b for @xmath31 and in figs .",
    "1c , d for @xmath42 .",
    "evolution times after the quench were chosen such that the typical domain sizes ( see section 3 ) nearly agree in both cases .",
    "apart from the much faster evolution in the case @xmath42 the most important observation is that type ",
    "i walls in figs .",
    "1a , b are flat and nearly perfect , whereas in figs .",
    "1c , d they show curvature and larger fluctuations .",
    "a connection of these different behaviors to kinetic properties will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "using experimental tracer diffusion constants for calibration , our algorithm allows us to relate the monte carlo time to the physical timescale in kinetic processes .",
    "details of this analysis , applied to cu@xmath1au , are described in @xcite . as an order  of  magnitude approximation we find that @xmath43  mcs roughly corresponds , for example , to @xmath44 at @xmath45 and @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "we come back to this point in section 3 when discussing different temporal regimes in domain coarsening processes .",
    "for a quantitative analysis of the structure and growth of domains we introduce equal  time structure factors @xmath48 . in view of the sign changes in the local order parameters",
    "@xmath49 across a wall , see section 2 , it is clear that the linear combinations @xmath50 and @xmath51 reflect the arrangement of type  ii and type ",
    "i walls , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , @xmath52 denotes the number of pairs @xmath53 that fulfill @xmath54 .",
    "typical distances between walls of either type are determined by the first moments @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the structure factors ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "in addition we study the excess energy stored in the domain walls , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the energy after complete equilibration .    in the following we focus on @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "2a - d @xmath59data are presented for different @xmath37 . at the highest temperature @xmath60 , which in all cases is slightly below @xmath33 , a shoulder as a remnant of an incubation period in the metastable regime",
    "is still visible , while a power  law  type decay of @xmath61 prevails for deeper quenches .",
    "a similar behavior is found for @xmath55 , see fig . 3 and also for @xmath62 ( not shown ) , which is always larger than @xmath55 .",
    "the important observation is that within the timescales of our simulations these power ",
    "laws change with @xmath37 . as mentioned already , at @xmath31 where type ",
    "i walls have zero energy , an anomalously slow growth is found , that can be represented by an effective exponent @xmath63 within an extended time window up to our largest computing times . upon introducing small second  neighbor interactions with @xmath64 we observe a significantly faster growth .",
    "this becomes particularly evident by comparing the data for the lowest temperature @xmath65 in figs .",
    "2a and 3a with those in figs .",
    "2b and 3b .",
    "the slope of these data corresponds to exponents still significantly smaller than 1/2 .",
    "further increase of @xmath37 to @xmath42 ( figs .",
    "2c and 3c ) yields exponents close to the `` normal '' behavior @xmath6 , pertaining here to @xmath66 and to a time regime starting even below @xmath67  mcs .",
    "no substantial change occurs when going to @xmath68 , as shown in figs .",
    "2d and 3d .",
    "the steeper decay near @xmath69  mcs can be traced back to finite size effects , as @xmath70 becomes of the order of the size @xmath71 of the simulation cell .",
    "these findings support the conclusion that the extraordinary slow growth in the case of zero nnn  interactions ( @xmath31 ) arises from the existence of zero  energy , curvatureless domain walls of type i , which are extremely stable . within the time window considered , such behavior appears representative for a class of systems with @xmath37 small , where type ",
    "i walls have sufficiently small , but non  zero energy .",
    "clearly , our results especially for @xmath72 do not allow us to draw any conclusion as to the exact asymptotics for quantities displayed in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "however , from the discussion at the end of section 2 it appears that simulations up to @xmath73  mcs already exhaust the timescales relevant to experiments for quenches sufficiently below the spinodal .    from the discussion of fig .",
    "1 it is clear that structure factors @xmath74 for a given @xmath4 are affected by a 1dimensional ( 1d ) array of type ",
    "ii walls parallel to the @xmath4direction and a 2d array of type ",
    "i walls perpendicular to it .",
    "hence we expect the structure factors @xmath75 and @xmath76 to obey scaling laws for 1d and 2d systems , respectively @xcite .",
    "this is verified in fig .",
    "4 showing master curves for @xmath75 and @xmath76 when scaled according to porod s law in one and two dimensions .",
    "this plot , applying to @xmath68 , is very similar to analogous plots in @xcite for @xmath31 ."
