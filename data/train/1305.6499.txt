    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are thought to be powered by the accretion of material onto a supermassive black hole @xcite . in the standard paradigm of accretion disks",
    "the infalling gas is able to gradually lose angular momentum by viscous processes , as it makes its way to tighter orbits around the black hole , ultimately converting a fair fraction of its rest energy to radiation @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "shorter wavelength photons are emitted by hotter gas inhabiting more compact regions around the black hole .",
    "some indication for the relevance of this simple physical picture to quasars is given by reverberation mapping ( rm ) studies . in a nut shell , if perturbations in the inner accretion flow result in enhanced short - wavelength emission , which impinges upon the the outer accretion flow , then enhanced emission from larger scales would be a delayed ( perhaps smeared ) version of the short - wavelength light curve .",
    "indeed , this scenario seems to be in excellent agreement with the observations of ngc7469 , being the only object for which multi - epoch high - cadence optical spectroscopy revealed a statistically robust wavelength - dependent time - delay between continuum emission at different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "attempts to expand such studies to other agn using photometric means revealed marginal signals , and a large scatter in properties , to which simple models provide unsatisfactory explanation @xcite .    beyond the accretion disk lies the broad line region ( blr ) , which is responsible for the broad , typically a few @xmath0 wide , emission lines seen in the spectra of type - i agn .",
    "such lines respond to the flux variations of the continuum source , indicating that photoionzation is a key process setting their properties .",
    "while there is considerable uncertainty in the geometry and the physical origin of the blr , this component of the active nucleus provides a valuable means for estimating the mass of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) , which power all quasars .",
    "specifically , upon measuring the size of the blr using rm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and given a rather generic set of assumptions concerning its kinematics , the obtained black hole masses are in agreement with other independent methods , as applied to nearby objects @xcite",
    ".    in its simplest form , rm of agn seeks a single time scale , a lag , between two light curves that arise from physically distinct , yet causally connected , regions .",
    "for example , in blr studies , pure continuum and pure emission line light curves are obtained by means of spectral decomposition , and various cross - correlation techniques may be used to determine the time lag , @xmath1 , between them ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , properly distinguishing between emission which arises from two distinct regions in the agn is not always possible .",
    "for example , line and continuum emission contribution to the signal are difficult to disentangle in regions of the spectrum where poorly resolved ( e.g. , iron ) line blends are present .",
    "also , dealing with photometric data , it is generally impossible to separate line from continuum emission hence standard cross - correlation analyses techniques may lead to erroneous results .    with the advance in large sky - coverage astronomy",
    ", the field is soon to be overwhelmed by high - quality photometric data for numerous quasars , in several broad wavelength bands .",
    "clearly , harnessing the power of photometric surveys to probe the physics of the innermost regions of agn is of importance , as it may shed light on long - standing questions concerning smbh demography and accretion physics .",
    "indeed , there have been several attempts to carry out continuum rm of the accretion disk in quasars using photometric means @xcite .",
    "in addition , several recent studies have shown that rm of the blr can also be carried out using narrow - band @xcite as well as broadband data @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the degree to which reliable ( non - degenerate ) information about blr _ and _ accretion physics may be obtained by pure photometric means , has not been explored .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the ability of photometric surveys to shed light on accretion disk and blr physics in agn .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : in  2 we discuss the limitations of standard cross - correlation analysis , and outline a new rm scheme in  3 where we also critically assess its applicability by means of simulations .",
    "section 4 applies the approach to publicly available data from @xcite .",
    "some physical implications of our results are detailed in  5 with a summary following in  6 .",
    "we have previously shown that line - to - continuum time - delays may be constrained using pure broadband photometric means ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and see also @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , this raises the concern that the contribution of emission lines to the broadband flux might influence time - delay measurements between adjacent continuum bands using photometric data @xcite . that such a problem exists is already hinted by the results of ( *",
    "* see their fig . 6 ) and",
    "* see their fig .",
    "6 ) who correlated continuum emission at different wavebands , and found that the wavelength - dependent lag , @xmath2 , is considerably larger at wavelengths where line emission is present ( but does not reflect on the line - to - continuum time - delay ) .",
    "there are good indications that interband time - delays , using broadband photometric data , suffer from similar effects , as can be seen in in figure [ cak ] after @xcite : the typical time - lag derivative @xmath3 shows a jump around 6000 , which is likely driven by the fact that the @xmath4 band includes substantial contribution of the h@xmath5 line to its flux ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "in contrast , simple models for irradiated accretion disks , which are often used to interpret the data @xcite , predict a monotonic function for @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ cak ] ) .    to gain better understanding of the effect that broad emission lines may have on the measured interband time - delay we resort to simulations akin to those used by @xcite : we model the continuum light curve , @xmath6 , as a fourier sum of independent modes with random phases",
    "whose amplitude , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a random gaussian variable with a standard deviation of 0.2 and a zero mean @xcite .",
    "we then construct a second broadband lightcurve , @xmath10 , which includes the contribution from continuum and line processes , both of which are delayed with respect to @xmath6 , so that @xmath11 * f_c$ ] ( @xmath12 denotes convolution ) . here",
    ", @xmath13 is the broad emission line contribution to the broadband flux , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the ( poorly constrained ) continuum and line transfer functions , respectively , with @xmath16 being their respective centroids . for simplicity , we consider the observationally - motivated thick shell blr model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig . 2 for definition and @xcite for further details ) for both transfer functions and note that the results are not very sensitive to this choice .",
    "for the set of models considered in this section we take @xmath17days and a finite @xmath18 , and look for interband time - delays for a range of observing and sampling conditions .",
    "as expected , a lag - distribution is obtained on accounts of the different light curve realizations ( fig .",
    "[ biases ] ) .",
    "the particulars of the distributions depends on the emission line properties , the sampling , and the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "nevertheless , the mean of those distributions is generally biased to positive lags implying that interband time - delays can not be used to reliably constrain accretion disk physics .",
    "the bias increases with the fractional contribution of the emission line to the band , and is larger for poorer sampling .",
    "the effect of the number of points in the light curve , as well as the presence or absence of light curve gaps ( so long as adequate sampling is maintained ) is , generally , secondary .",
    "lower signal - to - noise ( s / n ) observations result in a larger dispersion of the measured lags yet does not wash away the bias .    in light of the above analysis , one must consider the possibility that some of the measured interband time - delays , in any sample @xcite , have little to do with accretion disk physics but rather indirectly reflect on the broad emission line `` contamination '' of one or more of the bands .",
    "the problem may be further aggravated should additional slowly varying continuum components be present , such as hot dust emission close to the nuclear source @xcite .",
    "the limitation of current analysis methods , and the direction headed by future photometric surveys , warrant further investigation into improved analyses techniques that may be able to alleviate the degeneracy between line- and continuum - induced delays .",
    "consider a simplified scenario wherein a quasar is observed in two wavelength bands leading to two light curves : @xmath19 to which only continuum emission processes contribute , and @xmath20 to which both slightly lagging continuum emission , and an additional , slowly varying and lagging component contribute . without loss of generality",
    ", we shall assume the latter component is associated with broad line emission .",
    "as previously noted , the details of the transfer functions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are poorly known . nevertheless , to zeroth order approximation one may write and @xmath10 are the fluxed versions of the lightcurves . ] , @xmath23 where @xmath5 ( @xmath24 ) is the contribution of the broad emission line to the broadband flux .",
    "observationally , neither the time lags , nor @xmath5 are known , although the latter may often be estimated if , for example , a single epoch spectrum ( or some general knowledge of quasar spectra ) is available and the broadband filter transmission curve is known ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . using the above approximation to @xmath10",
    "we are neglecting higher order moments of the transfer functions other than their centroids . as we shall show below",
    ", this approximation is often adequate for recovering the lags .",
    "there are several possible ways to deduce the set of parameters @xmath25 $ ] for which @xmath26 provides the best approximation to @xmath10 . here",
    "we use standard correlation analysis , and define the multivariate correlation function ( mcf ) , @xmath27 [ f^m_{lc}(t_i;\\tau_c,\\tau_l ) -\\bar{f}^m_{lc}(\\tau_c,\\tau_l)]}{n\\sigma_{f_{lc } } \\sigma_{f^m_{lc}}(\\tau_c,\\tau_l ) } , \\label{ccf}\\ ] ] where barred quantities are averages , and @xmath28 denote standard deviations .",
    "we emphasize that all quantities on the righthand side of equation [ ccf ] depend , either explicitly or implicitly , on @xmath29 and @xmath30 as only overlapping portions of the light curves are being evaluated @xcite .",
    "the interpolation method used here to compute equation [ ccf ] for general light curves is outlined in the appendix . to constrain @xmath31 and @xmath5 ,",
    "we seek points in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) parameter space , defined by @xmath32 , which maximize @xmath4 .",
    "two interesting limits of the above correlation function are the following : when pure line and continuum light curves are available ( e.g. , via spectral decomposition ) , @xmath33 , and the formalism converges to the standard cross - correlation technique employed by rm studies . when broadband data are concerned so that @xmath34 , and continuum transfer effects are negligible ( i.e. , when setting @xmath35days ) , it can be easily shown that the formalism converges to the scheme adopted by @xcite , while setting @xmath36 , results in the expression defined by @xcite up to an additive constant and an overall scaling factor . ] .",
    "as the above formalism is not restricted to a particular value of @xmath5 , the method is applicable also to narrow - band data , for which , typically , @xmath37 . unlike recent implementations of narrow - band rm that seek a maximum in the cross - correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , and a spectrally - motivated value for @xmath5 is assumed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , in our formalism , no prior knowledge of @xmath5 is required , and its value is being constrained by the requirement for a maximal @xmath4-value within the computational domain .",
    "the proposed method can also be applied to spectroscopic data sets where it can alleviate the need for spectral decomposition of line and continuum signals .",
    "this can be especially beneficiary in regions of the spectrum where spectral decomposition into continuum and line features is challenging , such as near iron emission line blends @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we apply the method for broadband photometric data .      to demonstrate the ability of the above formalism to constrain the relevant model parameters using broadband photometric data , we resort to simulations of the type described in  2 . for the particular case shown in figure [ 3d ] , we assume @xmath40days , @xmath41days , and @xmath42 .",
    "500 daily visits are assumed in each band , and a measurement uncertainty of 1% is considered .",
    "we show several slices in 3d space where red colors correspond to high @xmath4-values .",
    "two solutions are evident where @xmath4 peaks : @xmath25=[5,100,0.17]$ ] and @xmath25=[100,5,0.83]$ ] . that these two solutions are in fact the same is evident from the definition of @xmath26 , which is symmetric with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 interchanges , and results from the fact that both the continuum and emission line templates , are identical .",
    "we note that the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath5 is relatively simple in the sense that , for a particular choice of @xmath45 $ ] , one maximum will be obtained along the @xmath5-dimension ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their eq .",
    "a2 and its following derivatives ) .",
    "this allows us to reduce the general problem to that of finding the maximum of @xmath4 in the 2d plane where @xmath46 , and where @xmath47 is the value of @xmath5 which maximizes @xmath4 given @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the 2d projection is also shown in figure [ 3d ] , over - plotted with contours of @xmath47 .",
    "the maxima described above are clearly evident , as well as the symmetric nature of the correlation function with respect to the diagonal .",
    "besides the prominent peak , for which the deduced parameters satisfy @xmath25\\simeq[\\tau_c^i,\\tau_l^i,\\alpha^i]$ ] , we note a ridge extending from the peak down just above the line where @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the fact that @xmath4 is relatively large over this ridge , although _ not _ at maximum in the 2d plane , has to do with the fact that the somewhat broadened and lagging shape of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath6 may be ( poorly ) reconstructed by two , slightly offset in time , versions of @xmath6 , with comparable weights .    to be able to separately deduce @xmath29 and @xmath30 depends on our ability to disentangle the two sources contributing to the _ total _ transfer function giving rise to @xmath10 , namely @xmath50 . clearly , there are situations where this will not be possible : for example , if @xmath51 then , under realistic noisy observing conditions , it will not be possible to detect line emission , and a solution , which is insensitive to @xmath18 will be obtained . at the other extreme , if @xmath52 then no continuum component will be observed , and the solution will be insensitive to @xmath53 . nevertheless , because in those two limits , @xmath10 is essentially a somewhat broadened and shifted version of @xmath6 ( on accounts of @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) , a superior fit to the light curve may be obtained by a linear combination of roughly equally proportioned @xmath6 templates slightly shifted with respect to the relevant lag .",
    "for example , for @xmath52 , a solution may be obtained with @xmath49 and @xmath54 and @xmath55 so that neither of the deduced lags reflects directly on the physics of the blr , yet their average does .",
    "similarly , when @xmath56 , @xmath57 solutions will be obtained with @xmath49 . clearly , in such limiting cases , the physics of only one region may be constrained , and a more straightforward model to consider is by setting @xmath58 or @xmath59 , in which case a simple cross - correlation scheme is recovered .    to better understand the limitations of our formalism , we carried out sets of simulations wherein quasar light curves were constructed given @xmath60 $ ] , and the deduced @xmath25 $ ] from the 3d correlation function logged .",
    "comparing the input values to the deduced ones , we find the following trends : it is possible to reliably deduce the input lags so long as @xmath61 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath62 , which results from the fact that @xmath63 neglects higher moments of the line transfer function other than its centroid . for @xmath13",
    "outside this range , @xmath49 is obtained , and two limits may be defined : the pure continuum limit , and the pure line limit .",
    "the first limit applies when @xmath64 , and the continuum - to - continuum time - delay is given by @xmath65 , and no reliable information may be obtained concerning line emission in this case . in the line - dominated limit , the line - to - continuum time - delay",
    "is obtained using a similar expression and the data can not be used to determine continuum time - delays .",
    "therefore , caution is advised when interpreting cases for which @xmath49 is obtained .",
    "the above is graphically summarized in figure [ check ] for a particular set of simulations with @xmath66days and @xmath67days .    in case",
    "the identity of @xmath6 and @xmath10 is unknown ( as would be the case if , for example , the contribution of varying emission lines to the respective bands is unknown ) , or if one wishes to keep an open mind concerning the propagation of perturbations across the accretion flow , one should extend the 3d correlation analysis to negative values of @xmath5 and @xmath29 . specifically , by reversing the choice of light curves ( @xmath68 ) , the solution transforms such that @xmath25 \\to [ -\\tau_c,\\tau_l,-\\alpha ] $ ] .",
    "deviations from simple solution symmetry will occur when @xmath69 , which might be of some relevance to highly ionized broad emission lines .",
    "the common practice in the field of rm is to use the fr - rss scheme for estimating the uncertainty on the deduced lags @xcite .",
    "briefly , the flux randomization ( fr ) part of the algorithm accounts for the effect of measurement uncertainty , while the purpose of the random subset selection ( rss ) scheme is to check the sensitivity of the result to sampling by randomly selecting sub - samples of the data and operating on those @xcite .",
    "as such , the fr - rss algorithm provides a combination of error and significance estimates .    although the rss algorithm is mathematically well - defined , it is , in fact , arbitrary , as it discards , on average , a certain fraction of all visits , often leading to over - estimated errors ( s. kaspi , private communication ) .",
    "an additional shortcoming of the rss approach is that it transforms , by construction , an evenly - sampled time - series , to an unevenly sampled one , with all the related complications @xcite .",
    "this means that , although useful in some cases , the rss scheme may not be generally applicable .",
    "in particular , when applied to our problem , the rss scheme tends to unjustifiably suppress the signal and mix two physically - distinct solutions ( see below ) , leading to measurement uncertainties that are driven more by systematic effects than statistical ones .",
    "lastly , using the fr - rss scheme , it is not clear how to estimate the detection significance of an emission line signal lurking in the data ; recall , that broadband light curves are to zeroth order identical , and that an emission line signal may not be easily discernible by eye .",
    "the approach taken here is different : we separately treat the question of emission line lag uncertainty and its significance .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty on the deduced lags and @xmath5 using the fr part of the fr - rss algorithm . more specifically ,",
    "if @xmath70 $ ] is characterized by measurement uncertainties @xmath71 $ ] , then new light curves may be reconstructed from the original data so that : @xmath72",
    "[ and similarly @xmath73 , where @xmath9 is a random gaussian variable with a zero mean and a standard deviation being the measurement uncertainty .",
    "the 3d cross - correlation analysis is repeated for many light curve realizations thereby generating 3d correlation peak distribution , allowing us to estimate the uncertainty on each of the parameters .",
    "figure [ fr ] shows the time lags and @xmath5 distribution functions for the model considered in figure [ 3d ] , and for several levels of measurement noise .",
    "as expected , the best constrained parameter at any noise level is @xmath29 due to the dominance of continuum emission processes in quasar light curves .",
    "results for both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are most reliable for @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the typical noise level in the bands , and @xmath76 the mean flux level . for larger values of @xmath77 , the lag distribution functions significantly broaden , are clearly non - gaussian , yet their modes are around the input lags .",
    "when @xmath78 , the emission line lag distribution may become double peaked , with one peak around @xmath18 , and the second peak at shorter times , of order @xmath53 .",
    "this behavior results from the emission line signal being gradually washed out by noise , and equally favorable agreement with the data is obtained by ignoring its contribution . under such conditions , a double humped @xmath5-distribution appears for @xmath78 , with one peak at around @xmath13 , and the other at @xmath49 ( in our experience , an implementation of the fr - rss scheme to such cases unjustifiably degrades the signal , and leads to poorly resolved solutions ) . for still larger values of @xmath77 ,",
    "the line signal is quenched and only @xmath49 and @xmath79 peaks persist , as discussed above . in what follows , and",
    "unless otherwise specified , we identify the parameter values with the more pronounced peaks of their respective distributions , with an uncertainty interval encompassing 68% on either side of the peaks .",
    "it is important to realize that there may be inter - dependencies among the deduced values of the parameters .",
    "specifically , at high levels of measurement noise , a large range of @xmath30 and @xmath5 values is consistent with the data , as can be seen from their broadened distributions , yet larger values of @xmath5 also correspond to solutions with shorter @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , using prior information on the value of @xmath5 , if available , could help to constrain @xmath30 even in cases where @xmath78 . that this is the case is is shown in the bottom - right panel of figure [ fr ] : at high noise levels both @xmath5 and @xmath30",
    "are significantly anti - correlated and span a large range of values with the most probable @xmath30 being at @xmath80days . however , by setting the constraint @xmath81 ( note the shaded region in fig .",

    "results for the model discussed above ( see also fig.[3d ] ) are shown in figure [ sig ] , and imply that , for low noise levels ( i.e. , @xmath229 ) , a highly significant result is obtained as the real and the simulated ( using the @xmath230 template ) @xmath4-distributions do not overlap . for higher noise levels ,",
    "the two distributions ( using the real and shuffled data ) begin to overlap , as can be seen for the case @xmath231 , and the probability that the result is spurious is non - negligible .",

    "these luminosities may substantially differ from those quoted in other works [ e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ] and may reflect on the actual variability of the sources , as well as on systematics in the luminosity determination affecting different works . as we are only interested in qualitative lag - luminosity relations , we do not quote luminosity uncertainties in this paper . for comparison purposes table 1",
    "reports also on the interband time delay , @xmath84 , between the @xmath217 and @xmath4 bands .",
    "our aim in this section is two - fold : 1 ) to constrain time - delays between continuum emission components that contribute to the two bands , thereby assessing the reliability of simple interband cross - correlation techniques in shedding light on accretion disk physics , and 2 ) to simultaneously constrain the line - to - continuum time - delay using our formalism .",
    "the latter quantity is independently known from spectroscopic studies for most of the objects ( table 1 ) , and may thus be used for benchmarking purposes .",
    "we first focus on instructive examples and then consider the reliability of our results as far as the statistical properties of the sample are concerned . unless otherwise specified , we search for time - delays ( i.e. , peaks in the correlation functions ) in the parameter space defined by @xmath236days , @xmath237days , and @xmath238 .      ngc5548 is a well studied seyfert 1 galaxy with a correlation function , @xmath239 , peaking around @xmath240days , @xmath241days , and at @xmath242 . in particular ,",
    "a single well - defined peak is visible in the computational domain ( apart from reflection symmetry , as discussed in  3 ) .",
    "using a spectroscopically - determined prior on @xmath5 does not significantly alter the recovered time - delays .",
    "further , the signal is highly significant according to our test , as can be seen from the non overlapping @xmath4-distributions using the real and permutated line templates , with the latter resulting in a maximal cross - correlation coefficient , @xmath4 , being lower , by @xmath243 ( recall that only the emission - line template is being permutated hence the detection of the emission line signal lurking in the @xmath4 light curve is significant ) .",
    "the deduced @xmath30 is in good agreement with spectroscopic rm results ( table 1 ) .",
    "however , @xmath29 is smaller by an order of magnitude compared to @xmath84 , which leads us to conclude that , for ngc5548 , the interband time delay is biased due to the contribution of non - continuum emission to the signal , hence its value has little to do with accretion physics . as shall be further discussed below",
    ", the reported @xmath29 is also in better agreement with naive irradiated accretion disk models , and the spectroscopically - measured lag for an object of a similar luminosity @xcite .",
    "1e0754.6 + 392 is a narrow line object , with a reported spectroscopic line - to - continuum time - delay of @xmath82days @xcite . without the use of priors on the value of @xmath5 , two peaks are evident in the projected correlation function ( fig .",

    "while the former solution corresponds to a case in which the algorithm prefers to reproduce @xmath10 by ignoring the contribution of an emission line component to the @xmath4-band ( see  3.1 ) , the latter solution is qualitatively consistent with the expected contribution of the h@xmath5 emission line to the @xmath4-band , and with the spectroscopic time - delay .",
    "the bimodal nature of the solution is also manifested in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 distributions produced by our error estimation algorithm ( fig .",

    "despite the favorable properties of our solution , @xmath5 is only marginally greater than zero ( table 1 ) , which implies that the emission line component is only marginally detected .",
    "similarly , the significance of the solution , with no priors set ( fig .",
    "[ 1e ] and table 1 ) , is also marginal with @xmath252 chance of being spurious . to better understand this finding we note that ( a ) the signal to noise for this object is the lowest in our sample , and ( b ) although the peak in the correlation function occurs for @xmath253 , some of the qualitative features of the correlation function are also evident when @xmath254 ( not shown here due to overall similarity with the right panel of fig",
    "this case merely reflects on the limitations of our interpolation scheme ( see appendix ) , and demonstrates that our significance scheme is able to capture such occurrences .",
    "other computational schemes for evaluating the correlation function , such as those based on gaussian processes @xcite , and more akin to todcor @xcite might lead to more robust results also in this case . considering algorithms of this sort",
    "is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the analyses of the light curves in this case , whether or not priors are assumed , yield statistically similar results , @xmath255 ( not shown ) , which are significantly smaller than spectroscopic measured lag of @xmath256days ( table 1 ) .",

    "this leads to an effective non - stationary behavior of the light curves , which limits the usefulness of many methods for time - series analysis .",
    "a common practice to restore ( quasi- ) stationarity and obtain more reliable time - lag measurements , is to invoke de - trending @xcite .",
    "de - trending of the @xmath217 and @xmath4 light curves by a first degree polynomial , and repeating the analysis , we obtain a line - to - continuum delay , which is in better agreement with the spectroscopic results ( table 1 ) .",
    "we note that de - trending appears to have a relatively small effect on the results for the other objects in our sample , yet all results quoted in table 1 and discussed here were obtained using de - trended light curves .      analyzing the data for this object we find evidence for a double peak structure in @xmath4 , and whether or not priors are set on the value of @xmath5 ( fig .",

    "[ n4151 ] ) yields a 1d correlation function , which is comparable to the one obtained from a cross - correlation analysis of the spectroscopic data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the right panel of fig .",
    "[ n4151 ] ) . specifically , a well separated two peak structure is evident , which roughly matches the structure seen in @xcite . in accordance with other works ,",
    "we identify the first peak at @xmath260days with the size of the blr in ngc4151 , but note that a broader range of blr scales may be applicable .      in its current implementation ,",
    "the method proposed here is able to detect a significant signal in most objects .",
    "specifically , only @xmath261% of the sample are characterized by a signal whose significance is @xmath262% , with the confidence level for @xmath263% of the objects being @xmath264 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the least significant signal detections are also characterized @xmath5-values that are marginally consistent with zero , and their lags deviate the most from the spectroscopic lags ( table 1 and fig .",
    "[ comp1 ] ) .",
    "the light curves of agn for which emission line signals were not securely detected are broadly characterized by a combination of a lower reduced variability measure ( e.g. , the case of 1e0754.6 + 392 having the largest photometric errors in the sample ) , and/or having a smaller number of photometric points .",
    "quite generally , we find that @xmath265 , in some cases by as much as an order of magnitude ( fig [ comp1 ] and table 1 , and note the case of ngc5548 ) , and attribute that to the presence of a relatively strong emission line contribution to the @xmath4-band , which biases the cross - correlation function (  2 ) .",
    "considering the sample as a whole , we find a mean @xmath266 , implying that interband time - delays are poor tracers of @xmath29 , and that their use may lead to erroneous results concerning the sizes of accretion disks .",
    "we find good agreement between @xmath30 and @xmath267 ( table 1 and fig .",
    "[ comp2 ] ) , and that the two measurements are more tightly correlated when priors on @xmath5 are incorporated into the analysis ( leading to pearson s @xmath268 ; see fig .",
    "[ comp2 ] ) .",
    "while some of the scatter may be attributed to those objects with less secure lag measurements , some residual scatter remains even for the best - case examples ( table 1 ) . a potentially relevant source for the residual scatter",
    "is the time - varying nature of the blr size in agn as traced by line emission @xcite . in particular , a range of lags , spanning a factor @xmath269 has been measured for the h@xmath235 line in ngc5548 at different epochs , which , if characteristic of agn [ see also fig .",
    "[ n4151 ] where the results of @xcite and @xcite differ by a similar factor ] , could fully account for the observed scatter .    comparing columns ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) in table 1 , we find a hint for @xmath270 .",
    "a proper investigation into these subtle effects is currently unwarranted yet we note that this might reflect on additional emission components , other than h@xmath5 , which are being emitted on blr - scales and contribute to the @xmath4-band signal , such as paschen recombination emission .",
    "alternatively , it may reflect on the relative contribution of emission lines to the varying component in the @xmath4-band being larger than their relative contribution to the flux .    attempting to quantify possible systematic effects between the photometric lags and the spectroscopic ones",
    "is currently unwarranted due to small number statistics .",
    "nevertheless , there is no clear indication for a bias , which suggests that the method is immune to a small contribution of emission line signal to the @xmath217-band .",
    "this conclusion is also in accordance with the findings of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "care should be taken , however , when interpreting the results in cases where the broadband data contain comparable contributions from several emission lines ( or other emission components ) with very different time delays .",
    "a possible means to treat such cases may involve the generalization of our model to higher dimensions , yet such a treatment is beyond the scope of the present work , and is not warranted by the current data .",
    "although the sample is small , and of no match to what will be possible to achieve with future surveys , it is nevertheless worth placing our results in a physical context .      in @xcite , the concept of broadband photometric rm",
    "was introduced as a means for ( statistically ) estimating the size of the blr to potentially unprecedented precision using high - quality data for many objects in the era of large photometric surveys , such as lsst .",
    "in particular , the relatively small number of visits per filter in the sample of quasars used in that work yielded significant delays in only a handful of objects , and the advantage of the method was demonstrated mainly on statistical grounds .",
    "better datasets demonstrated that such an approach may be used to determine the blr size also in individual objects @xcite .    here , by adopting a refined rm approach with a revised significance and error estimation algorithm , and working with superior photometric data , we are able to securely measure time - delays associated with the blr in most objects , and are therefore able , for the first time , to plot the photometric version of the size - luminosity relation for the blr in fig . [ lagl ] .",
    "evidently , the photometric relation statistically traces the spectroscopic one , and both have qualitatively similar scatter around the @xcite relation .",
    "clearly , with high - quality data in several bands , for numerous objects , much more precise versions of figure [ lagl ] may be obtained , also for different sub - classes of agn , and for different emission lines .      while standard accretion disk models @xcite have been very successful in accounting for some properties of agn emission , many uncertainties remain , and the search is on for additional reliable means to probe their physics .",
    "specifically , a fundamental open question , in the context of agn accretion , concerns the size of the region from which the bulk of the optical emission is emitted .",
    "a promising route to shed light on the size of those spatially - unresolved regions is via rm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    for standard accretion disks characteristic of most agn ,",
    "the predicted optical emission is of a powerlaw form dependence on photon energy , and its luminosity , @xmath272 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* where @xmath273 is the black hole mass , and @xmath274 the accretion rate ) .",
    "on the other hand , the effective accretion disk size , at a given restframe wavelength , scales as @xmath275 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the crossing time for perturbations over a part of the optical disk , @xmath276^{1/2}$ ] .    our lag - luminosity relation is shown in figure [ lagl ] , with the value corresponding to the spectroscopic measurement of ngc7469 over - plotted ( * ? ? ?",
    "* converted to the wavelength range covered here ; see their fig .",
    "7 ) . evidently , the continuum lags deduced here are of the right order of magnitude for objects with a similar luminosity to ngc7469 .",
    "specifically , for objects with luminosities @xmath277dex of ngc7469 , the median @xmath29 agrees with the spectroscopically measured lag in ngc7469 , while most interband time - delays in this luminosity range are greater than this value by a factor @xmath278 ( in the latter case the standard deviation of the lags is also larger by a factor @xmath269 ) .",
    "furthermore , the lag - luminosity relation is qualitatively consistent with the expected power - law behavior from a thin irradiated accretion disk model , using ngc7469 s time - delay as a pivot ( note that results at the low - luminosity end may be affected by under - sampling ) .",
    "we do not , however , attempt to provide more quantitative statements in this work , and refer the reader to @xcite where a more refined analysis , based on multi - band data is carried out .",
    "reverberation mapping ( rm ) has proven to be a valuable technique for studying spatially unresolved regions in agn . specifically , it has been implemented , using spectroscopic data , to measure the size of the blr in @xmath279 agn , and has also been used to place constraints on the size of the accretion disk in a few systems .",
    "nevertheless , spectroscopic datasets that are adequate for rm are scarce .",
    "in contrast , photometric data are relatively easy to acquire yet disentangling the various emission processes that contribute to the signal is not straightforward , which could lead to erroneous conclusions .    motivated by upcoming ( photometric ) surveys that will provide exquisite light curves for numerous agn",
    ", we propose to generalize the cross - correlation scheme and work instead with a multivariate correlation function ( mcf ) .",
    "the advantages of the proposed approach are the following :    a.   it can simultaneously constrain continuum - to - continuum ( accretion disk ) , and line - to - continuum ( blr ) time delays , as well as the relative contribution of their respective processes to the signal . as such , it improves upon current cross - correlation techniques for lag determination .",
    "b.   the method is equally applicable to photometric ( broad- and narrow - band ) and spectroscopic data . as such",
    ", it allows for the reliable determination of the time - delays even in cases where spectral decomposition of line and continuum processes is challenging . c.   prior knowledge of one or more of the variables in the problem",
    "can be easily incorporated into the analysis thereby leading to more robust constraints on the remaining model parameters .",
    "applying the method to the high - quality broadband photometric data for 14 agn in the @xcite sample , we are able to simultaneously determine accretion disk scales and blr sizes in those sources .",
    "in particular , our photometric line - to - continuum time - delays for individual objects are in good agreement with spectroscopic balmer line lag measurements .",
    "this further demonstrates ( see also @xcite ) that , provided photometric data are adequate , spectroscopic data are not a prerequisite for blr size determination .",
    "in addition , we provide the first _",
    "reliable _ accretion disk scale vs. agn luminosity relation , which is in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations from standard irradiated accretion disk models .",
