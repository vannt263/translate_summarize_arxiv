    "it is well known that the observed properties of elliptical galaxies obey a number of tight relations : the most well - studied of these are the colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) , the fundamental plane and the mg-@xmath4 relation @xcite .",
    "these correlations link the properties of the stellar populations of early - type galaxies with their masses and their structural properties and are believed to encode important information about how early - type galaxies formed .",
    "it has long been known that early - type galaxies in nearby clusters exhibit a tight colour - magnitude relation , i.e. more luminous ellipticals have redder colours than less luminous ellipticals @xcite .",
    "this work has been extended to moderate redshift and it is found that there is no significant change in the slope with redshift @xcite .",
    "the zero - point of the relation shows modest colour evolution , consistent with the passive ageing of a stellar population formed before @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the slope of the cmr of ellipticals has been found to show little dependence on environment @xcite .",
    "the origin of the cmr is still a matter of controversy .",
    "the conventional interpretation of the cmr is that it is primarily a metallicity effect @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that elliptical galaxies form monolithically in a single giant burst of star formation at high redshift . since the binding energy per unit mass of gas is higher in more massive galaxies , they are able to retain their gas for longer and so reach higher metallicities than less massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have argued that the cmr can also be explained in hierarchical models of galaxy formation when strong feedback is included . in these models ,",
    "the cmr for elliptical galaxies arises because large ellipticals form by mergers of massive , metal - rich progenitor disk systems .",
    "indeed , some evidence of that build - up in the early - type galaxy population has been observed @xcite . however , it is also possible to explain at least part of the cmr as an increase in mean stellar age with luminosity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite find strong evidence for a significant intermediate - age population in some elliptical galaxies .",
    "additional information about stellar populations can be gained by studying the strength of stellar absorption features in galaxy spectra .",
    "the standard way of quantifying absorption line strengths in galaxies is via the lick - ids system , which includes 25 spectral absorption features defined by a ` feature ' bandpass and two ` pseudo - continuum ' bandpasses .",
    "the indices are calibrated using the spectra of 460 galactic stars over the wavelength range from 4000  to 6400 .",
    "the sensitivities of different lick indices to stellar age and metallicity have been discussed in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "the h - balmer lines are primarily age - sensitive .",
    "likewise , the 4000   break ( i.e. the ratio of the flux blueward and redward of 4000 ) gets stronger with age , but for old stellar populations , it shows also a second - order sensitivity to metallicity .",
    "indices which are primarily sensitive to metallicity include fe and mg lines between 4500   and 5700   and molecular features such as the tio band . in massive elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the abundance of @xmath3-elements with respect to fe - peak elements can differ from the scaled - solar abundance ratio @xcite .",
    "indices which trace the abundance of either @xmath3-elements or fe - peak elements can therefore be sensitive to the degree of @xmath3-enhancement @xcite .",
    "in addition to correlations with galaxy luminosity , past studies of elliptical galaxies have also focused on how colours and absorption line indices depend on the stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy . to first order ,",
    "both the luminosity and the velocity dispersion of an elliptical are measures of its mass ; the luminosity measures the mass contained in stars and the velocity dispersion is a dynamical probe of the total mass contained within some radius .",
    "the star formation history of a galaxy , however , may not depend primarily on its mass .",
    "indeed , @xcite has shown that star formation rates in spiral galaxies correlate best with the local surface density of gas and a law of the form @xmath6 provides a good fit to the data .",
    "@xcite studied trends in the optical and infrared colours of a sample of nearby spiral galaxies and found that the colours most sensitive to star formation history correlate best with stellar surface density .",
    "furthermore , @xcite studied the relations between stellar mass , star formation history , size and internal structure of a complete sample of @xmath7 galaxies and found that the @xmath8 relation for the late - type galaxies can be well described by a single power law .",
    "they also found that the star formation history of low - mass galaxies are correlated more strongly with surface density than stellar mass .",
    "these results suggest that local rather than global factors regulate the rate at which spiral galaxies form their stars at the present day .",
    "motivated by the surface density dependence of spiral star formation histories , it seems worthwhile to search for surface density dependence in the properties of early - type galaxies .",
    "finally , in a recent work @xcite studied how the average optical spectra of massive galaxies in the sdss vary as a function of both luminosity and environment .",
    "they found that as redshift , luminosity and environment change , the variation of pairs of lick indices appears to follow a simple one - dimensional locus , suggesting that variations in these three parameters do not lead to independent changes in the spectra of elliptical galaxies .",
    "in this paper , we present the correlations between the colours of elliptical galaxies and a range of different _",
    "structural parameters_. we make use of data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) to construct a sample of early - type galaxies with photometry in five optical ( @xmath9 ) and three near - infrared bands _ j ( 1.25@xmath10 m ) , _ h ( 1.65@xmath10 m ) , _",
    "@xmath11 ( 2.17@xmath10 m ) bands . stellar velocity dispersions and size measurements for these systems",
    "are available from the sdss database and estimates of stellar mass are taken from the work of @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes how our sample is selected , the method adopted for doing the aperture correction and calculating ( k+e)-correction of magnitudes .",
    "section 3.1 presents the correlations between optical , optical - infrared , infrared colours and structural parameters . in section 3.2",
    ", we study the relations between colours and a variety of lick indices .",
    "finally , in section 4 we summarize our findings and give our conclusions .",
    "the sdss is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of the high galactic latitude sky visible from the northern hemisphere , which will obtain _ u , g , r , i and _ z photometry of almost a quarter of the sky and spectra of at least 700,000 objects @xcite .",
    "a description of the software and data products are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the 2mass is a ground - based , near - infrared imaging survey of the whole sky and its extended source catalog ( xsc ) contains almost 1.6 million galaxies @xcite .",
    "we positionally match sources observed by the 2mass to galaxies in the ` main ' spectroscopic sample of the sdss data release one ( dr1 ; abazajian et al .",
    "galaxies in this sample have @xmath12 .",
    "practically all 2mass sources in the dr1 area ( @xmath13% for extended sources from the xsc ) are matched to an sdss counterpart within 2 arcsec .",
    "we restrict our analysis to a narrow range of redshift @xmath14 in order to minimize uncertainties introduced by k - corrections .",
    "the entire matched sample contains 8166 galaxies in this range of redshift . _ _    in this paper , we focus on early - type galaxies . to select these systems",
    ", we require that they have 4000   break strength greater than 1.6 ( we adopt the narrow definition of the break given in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and concentration parameter @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the radii enclosing 90% and 50% of the total petrosian light of the galaxy ) .",
    "@xcite have shown that this cut separates massive , dense , early - type galaxies from low mass , low density late - type systems . in order to exclude systems with ongoing star formation or residual agn activity , we also eliminate all galaxies where the equivalent width of the h@xmath3 emission line is greater than 2   .",
    "our final sample contains 2728 early - type galaxies .      in order to compare optical and optical - infrared colours ,",
    "it is important that both sdss and 2mass magnitudes are measured within the same aperture .",
    "there are several sets of magnitudes provided in the 2mass xsc : elliptical isophotal magnitudes , circular isophotal magnitudes , total magnitudes using a kron elliptical aperture , total magnitudes from extrapolating the fit to the radial profile and magnitudes within fixed circular apertures ( 5 , 7 , 10 , 15 arcsec ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the isophotal fiducial magnitudes , which are measured within the circular aperture corresponding to a surface brightness of 20.0 mag arcsec@xmath18 in the @xmath11-band ( the aperture is denoted as @xmath19 ) . at this isophotal magnitude ,",
    "the background noise is still relatively low , but the aperture is large enough to enclose most of the light from the galaxy ( see the 4th panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "this set of magnitudes are measured with the same size aperture in all three ( @xmath20 ) 2mass bands and they thus provide a consistent set of infrared colours .    sdss provides the azimuthally averaged surface brightness in a series of circular annuli . in order to derive optical - infrared colours , we have calculated @xmath21 magnitudes that are matched to the 2mass measurements by interpolating the cumulative radial surface brightness profile in each sdss band at the corresponding isophotal radius @xmath19 . from now on , we refer to these corrected magnitudes as the `` sdss magnitudes '' and they are used to estimate the optical and optical - infrared colours throughout the paper .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the distribution of the @xmath22-band petrosian radius ( from sdss ) , the isophotal radius @xmath19 ( from 2mass ) , the quantity @xmath23 , and the @xmath22-band flux within @xmath19 divided by the petrosian flux .",
    "a small fraction of galaxies ( about 1.2 percent ) have isophotal radius larger than @xmath24 .",
    "we simply adopt the petrosian magnitudes for these galaxies and make no aperture correction .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that for most galaxies , a large fraction of petrosian flux is contained within @xmath19 . because colour gradients are small for early - type galaxies @xcite , it is safe to treat the colours deduced from the corrected sdss magnitudes as a global galaxy colours",
    ".    stellar mass estimates for this sample are available from the work of @xcite . to estimate stellar masses , two stellar absorption line indices , the 4000  break strength @xmath25 and the balmer absorption line index h@xmath26 , are used to constrain the mean stellar age of a galaxy and the fraction of its stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few gyr . a comparison with broad band magnitudes then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass .",

    "there are changes in the strengths of some of the correlations , but our main qualitative conclusions remain unchanged .",

    "one might thus worry that this might artificially strengthen the correlation between stellar absorption indices and velocity dispersion .",

    "kennicutt s law of star formation @xcite relates the star formation rate in galactic disks to the surface density of cold gas in the galaxy .",
    "the fact that we see very little correlation between spectral indices and surface density for ellipticals suggests that global processes , related to the mass of the system , have been more instrumental in setting the properties of galactic spheroids .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to investigate what can be learned from the optical , optical - infrared and infrared colours of elliptical galaxies . we have put together a sample of ellipticals from a matched sample of galaxies with photometry from both sdss and 2mass and spectroscopy from sdss .",

    "luminous and massive elliptical galaxies have redder optical , optical - infrared and infrared colours than less luminous and lower mass ellipticals .",
    "the optical , optical - infrared and infrared colours of elliptical galaxies correlate more strongly with stellar mass and velocity dispersion than with other structural parameters .",

    "3 .   both optical and optical - infrared colours are sensitive to metallicity and to element abundance ratios",
    ". however , the age of the stellar populations influences the optical colours somewhat more strongly than the optical - infrared colours .",
    "moreover , our results show that all lick indices correlate more strongly with velocity dispersion , either as measured within the fibre or as quantified by the ratio between stellar mass and petrosian half - light radius , than with any other structural parameter studied .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , the velocity dispersion scaled by the size of the system ( in this case , the effective radius ) provides a remarkably good estimate of the total ( stellar plus dark matter ) mass of the galaxy .",
    "we have also studied correlations between colours , spectral indices and the mass inferred from the measured velocity dispersion @xmath127 . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we compare these relations with those against stellar mass for @xmath59 colour , a representative age - sensitive index ( @xmath102 ) and a representative metallicity - sensitive index ( @xmath128 ) . in the left - hand panels the dot - dashed lines show the relations with total mass at fixed stellar mass , while in the right - hand panels they show the relations with stellar mass at fixed total mass .",
    "the middle and bottom panels show that the relation with total mass for galaxies with similar stellar mass has almost the same slope as the relation obtained for the sample as a whole . on the contrary , at fixed total mass , the relation with stellar mass becomes much shallower .",
    "however , the dependence on these two physical parameters is less distinguishable in the case of @xmath59 colour .",
    "it is difficult to tell from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] which is the most fundamental parameter between stellar and total mass .",
    "since both the absorption features and the velocity dispersion ( which enters in the estimate of total mass ) are measured within the fiber , while stellar mass is a global quantity , one might worry that the relation with total mass is strengthened by aperture effects .",
    "we checked the correlation between colours , spectral features and stellar mass in the fiber @xmath129 ( obtained by scaling stellar mass @xmath65 with the ratio between fiber and petrosian z - band luminosity ) and show part of the results in table  [ mass1 ] .",
    "it is shown that both the colours and spectral indices correlate more strongly with the mass inferred from the velocity dispersion than with the stellar mass measured within the fiber in the sense that the dispersion with the total mass is smaller that that of stellar mass in the fiber and @xmath88 in col .",
