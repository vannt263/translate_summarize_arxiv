    "this paper reports structural predictions for the decagonal quasicrystal @xmath0(alconi ) in the cobalt - rich ( ` basic co ' ) , of approximate composition al@xmath1co@xmath2ni@xmath3 and atomic density 0.068 atoms / @xmath4 , using simulations to minimize energy , using the same methods ( and codes ) as previous papers by mihalkovic , widom , and henley  @xcite on the ` ni - rich ' ; this constitutes a first test of the transferability of that approach to other compositions that are described by other tiling geometries .",
    "the aluminum - nickel - cobalt alloy @xmath0(alconi ) is the best studied and perhaps the highest quality of equilibrium decagonal quasicrystals .",
    "decagonal @xmath0(alconi ) has about eight modifications ( which we call ` ' here ) , each existing in a tiny domain of the phase diagram.@xcite .",
    "the compositions ` basic ni ' ( around @xmath5 ) , and ` basic co ' are the best - studied , having the simplest diffraction patterns .",
    "( the other show superstructure peaks , indicating modulations . ) several crystal approximants related to ` basic co ' are known  @xcite , one of which has a solved structure  @xcite .",
    "we find that ( in contrast to the ` basic ni ' ) , the framework of ` basic co ' at @xmath6 is a network of edge - sharing @xmath7 diameter decagons ( placed like the large atoms in a `` binary tiling '' quasicrystal ) . a strong ( but not always simple ) co / ni ordering is found .",
    "our model reproduces most , but not all , of the atomic positions in w(alconi ) .",
    "( a complementary brief account of our results is in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a more complete account is in preparation  @xcite . )",
    "our main assumption is that the @xmath0(alconi ) structure is well approximated by a stacking of equally spaced two - dimensional tilings built from the penrose rhombi under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the chief experimentally determined inputs were the values @xmath84.08 for the stacking period and @xmath92.45 for quasilattice constant ( edge length of small rhombi ) .",
    "this framework of decorated tilings takes advantage of the fact that all the known atomic structures of decagonals are penrose - tiling - like .",
    "further , even in random tilings penrose rhombi admit `` inflation '' constructions that can relate a tiling to another one using rhombi with edges enlarged by @xmath10 ( the golden ratio ) , which gives a convenient way to build a chain of connections from the atomic level to large tiles so as to describe @xmath0(alnico ) on large scales .",
    "[ fig : tiling ] includes two ways of subdividing a unit cell into a tiling of rhombi ( with edges @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ) .",
    "we also assume atomic pair potentials between al , co , and ni as derived ab - initio using generalised pseudopotential theory  @xcite ( gpt ) , but modified using results from _ ab initio _ calculations to approximate the sums of the omitted many - body interactions when transition metals ( tm ) are nearest neighbours .",
    "[ fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite plots these potentials . ]",
    "the potentials are cut off by a smooth truncation past 7.0 .    we know  @xcite that the strongest interaction is the al - tm first potential well .",
    "the number of al - tm neighbours is maximised and , as a corollary , that of tm - tm nearest neighbours is minimised ( but tm - tm second neighbours , at @xmath13 separation , are common ) .",
    "however , this scarcely constrains the structure since the weak al - al potential allows enormous freedom in placing al . in practice",
    ", one finds in al - tm quasicrystals that a rather rigid tm - tm network forms , with separations near to the strong second minimum of the tm - tm pair potential ; the al atoms fill the tm interstices in a more variable fashion .",
    "subtle details of the density and composition , as well as the small differences between co and ni in the pair potentials , decide which structure optimises the energy .",
    "we understand only a few of these factors in detail for the ` basic co ' phase , so in this paper we will only describe the atomic structures we found and do not attempt a microscopic rationalization of them .",
    "our program uses metropolis monte carlo ( mmc ) simulation to perform atom - atom and atom - vacancy swaps within a site list placed on the penrose tiles .",
    "the first stage simulations include an additional degree of freedom in the form of ` tile flips . '",
    "these ` tile flips ' obey the mmc algorithm probabilities and conserve tile number , atomic species number , and the collective outline of tiles rearranged .",
    "our procedure is to anneal from a high temperature @xmath14 - 10 ev@xmath15 to a low temperature at which most degrees of freedom are frozen out , @xmath16 ev@xmath15 , using a step size @xmath17 - 1 ev@xmath15 .",
    "( here @xmath18 . )",
    "at each temperature step , approximately 2000 atomic swaps per site are attempted .",

    "the left half is subdivided into @xmath11 scale rhombi ( in two ways in part of the cell [ dotted lines ] ) .",
    "the right half of the cell is subdivided into @xmath12 scale rhombi .",
    "insets at top left and top right display the candidate sites on the @xmath11 and @xmath12 scale tiles , respectively . filled large circles depict atoms in one layer and filled small circles are those in the other layer .",
    "black denotes nickel , dark gray cobalt , and light gray aluminium .",
    "unoccupied sites of the @xmath12 scale tiling are shown by very small empty circles ; those of the @xmath11 scale tiling are not shown .",
    ", width=297 ]      the strategy of our series of simulations loosely copies that reported previously  @xcite on the ni - rich of @xmath0(alnico ) , and can be thought of as a sort of multiscale modelling .",
    "it proceeds in the following stages :    * begin with monte carlo simulations allowing atom swaps and ` tile - flips ' with a tiling of relatively small penrose rhombi ; note prominent features and formations that recur in all the low energy structures from a sufficient number of independent runs . *",
    "take the observations from the small - scale tiling and promote them to rules : i.e. make the formations inferred in the first stage into fundamental objects of a larger scale tiling .",
    "unused ( or underused ) degrees of freedom are removed . *",
    "perform new monte carlo simulations on the larger - scale tiling to search for new low energy structures .",
    "this larger- scale tiling is generally more efficient at finding lower energies because of the reduced degrees of freedom . *",
    "verify that the degrees of freedom removed in stage ( 2 ) were indeed unnecessary by restoring some of them , judiciously .",
    "* repeat for larger and larger scale tilings .",
    "an eventual goal is to extract a ` tile hamiltonian '  @xcite which is the bridge to modelling long - range order and diffuse scattering .",
    "that means ascribing the atom - atom energies to an effective interaction among neighbouring tiles , so that tiles are the only remaining degree of freedom .",
    "it is also necessary to perform relaxations / molecular dynamics to escape the biases which may be introduced by the discrete site list used up through stage ( 4 ) .",
    "the first stage of our tiling simulations uses small penrose rhombi that have @xmath20 edges .",
    "the unit cell simulations had dimensions @xmath21 @xmath22@xmath23 , which we shall call the 32@xmath1923@xmath194 cell , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tiling ] .",
    "the structure is taken to repeat after two layers of the penrose tiling . at 0.068 atoms / @xmath4 , there are about 200 atoms in the unit cell .",
    "our low energy configuration generated at this level showed distinct rings of 5 tm and 5 al atoms surrounding an al atom and surrounded by an 10 al atom decagon with an edge length of @xmath11 .",
    "these 21-atom motifs were evidently energy favourable .",
    "linear regressions of the count of these 21-atom clusters versus energy revealed a noisy , but consistent correlation of @xmath24 ev per 21-atom cluster .    however , the ideal structure did not simply maximsze the number of 21-atom clusters : though they may be placed adjacent to pack six clusters per cell , that was typically not observed in the low - energy configurations .",
    "instead , further mmc annealing ( starting from a low - energy configuration ) found that a larger cluster emerged as the characteristic motif at this composition : a decagon with an edge length of @xmath25 ( hence a diameter of @xmath26 ) , which we will call ` 13  decagon ' ( 13d ) .",
    "this object contains the 21-atom motif at its centre , ten tm atoms at its vertices , and al atoms irregularly interspersed along and within its edges .",
    "we use the following nomenclature for the components of 13d , from its centre outwards .",
    "the centre of the 13d   is an al atom .",
    "the 5 tm 5 al ring is known as the ` first ring . '",
    "the tm atoms in the first ring are in the same layer as the central al atom .",
    "the 10 al ring is known as the ` second ring . '",
    "the 10 tm decagon and the al atoms along and within the edges are collectively known as the ` third ring . '",
    "miscellaneous al sites occur between the second and third rings , which we designate collectively as the ` 2.5 ring . '    in the 13d , the first ring tm sites are mainly occupied by co and the third ring ( decagon vertex ) tm sites also tend to co occupation , but there is a very strong dependence on the local environment that distinctly favour ni in certain sites .",
    "[ this became clear at the second stage of simulation , subsec .",
    "[ sec : inflated ] . ]",
    "the al positions of third - ring and 2.5 ring al atoms are closely correlated and the rules were not resolved from the 2.45 tiling simulation .",
    "a second type of motif fills the interstices between the 13ds : it consists of a 10-atom ring and an al at the centre , much like ring 1 in the 13d   cluster , except this kind of motif has mixed al - tm occupations for the 5 candidate tm sites . in general , about 3 sites out of the 5 candidates are filled with tm atoms , preferably ni .",
    "we name these 11-atom clusters `` star clusters '' ; a few of these are contained in fig .",
    "[ fig : tiling ] .      in keeping with our ` multiscale ' methodology , we reassessed the degrees of freedom necessary for the next level of simulation .",
    "the dominant geometric object is a decagon with edge @xmath28 , but we found it economical to represent its decoration by candidate sites using a thin 4 rhombus and the second fat rhombus shown in the right inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : tiling ] ; similarly , the star cluster   decoration is represented using the first fat rhombus .",
    "we assumed that the minimum - energy structure has a maximum density of 13d   clusters .",
    "a monte carlo simulation was carried out ( admitting only tile flips ) on the ensemble of @xmath12 rhombus tilings using an artificial tile hamiltonian favouring the creation of nonoverlapping ` star decagons ' ( of edge @xmath12 ) containing a fivefold star of fat rhombi .",
    "it was found that the ground state configuration was always a ` binary tiling '  @xcite of rhombi with edge length @xmath2910.4 with the ` large atom ' and ` small atom ' vertices replaced by 13ds   and star clusters , respectively .",
    "we * designate * a fixed site list on the @xmath12 rhombi , as shown in the right half of fig .",
    "[ fig : tiling ] , designed to match the most frequently occupied sites observed in the low - energy states from out @xmath11 scale simulations .",
    "this tiling , unlike the @xmath11 tiling , consists of only _",
    "one _ layer of penrose tiles , each of which has site decorations in _ two _ layers spaced 2.04 in the @xmath30 direction .",
    "note how the two versions of the fat penrose rhombus have different site lists .",
    "we use the 32@xmath1923@xmath194 cell , as before so we may compare the energies for systems with exactly the same density and composition .    at this second stage ,",
    "our mmc runs had purely lattice gas moves on a fixed tiling ( no tile flips ) .",
    "these were able to find lower energy configurations at a much faster rate than the first - stage ( @xmath11 scale ) simulations at the same composition and atomic density , due to the much decreased site list .",
    "hence , the occupations of many types of sites were discerned with greater accuracy , such as the tm sites in the 13  decagon   ( already described in subsec .",
    "[ sec : decagon ] ) . furthermore the tendencies of more variable sites ( al in rings 2.5 and 3 , and tm in the star cluster ) , which will be described in a longer paper  @xcite , started to come into focus .",
    "finally , despite having _ fewer _ allowed configurations , the @xmath12 tiling simulation consistently found _ lower _ energies , which serves as our post hoc justification for assuming 13d   clusters in the binary tiling geometry and the reduced site list .",
    "tiles , and it was verified this had a negligible effect . ]    in the prior case of the ` basic ni ' , the decoration model  @xcite was implemented as a deterministic tiling .",
    "a marked contrast in the present ` basic co ' case is that we can not impose a simple rule that fixes the chemical occupation of each site . on certain tm sites ,",
    "it is difficult to resolve the occupation ( co / ni ) ; certain al sites are also variably occupied ( al / vacant ) depending on the environment . presumably , with a sufficiently thorough understanding of our model",
    ", we could formulate a deterministic decoration rule on the binary tiling .",
    "it is possible , however , that the energy differences among some competing structures are too small to be visible in a reasonable simulation , or to influence the real properties at any accessible temperature .",
    "the physical accessible candidate sites in the @xmath12 decagons ( with our decoration ) in fact have a @xmath31 point group symmetry , which is not broken by the binary tiling geometry .",
    "the fivefold symmetric 13d   cluster breaks this symmetry , by the layer on which the central al sits and the al / tm alternation on the first ring .",
    "thus , a major obstacle to writing a deterministic decoration is that the relative orientations of 13ds   must be specified , which depends on subtle interaction energies between them .",
    "experimentally , @xmath0(alconi ) with our co - rich composition was observed to order in a fivefold symmetry , wherein all the decagons are oriented the same way  @xcite .    as a test",
    ", we compared the lowest - energy configurations resulting from mmc simulations on identical @xmath12 tilings in which neighbouring 13ds   were forced either to have always identical or always opposite orientations .",
    "[ this is controlled by the orientation of the decagon of @xmath12 rhombi in the tiling that gets decorated .",
    "] we evaluated the minimum - energy configurations from @xmath32 independent runs of each type .",
    "we used the 32@xmath1923@xmath194 unit cell , using a fixed composition al@xmath1co@xmath2ni@xmath3 , but repeating the tests for a a series of atom number densities @xmath33 .",
    "the energy difference between these two orientations was density dependent . at @xmath34",
    "atoms/ @xmath4 the two orientational patterns are practically degenerate ( though with visibly distinct atom configurations . ) from @xmath350.068 @xmath36 to 0.074 @xmath36  a range which includes the most realistic compositions  the pattern with uniform orientations has the lower energy , by up to @xmath37ev / atom , but this difference disappears again at @xmath380.074 @xmath36 .",
    "we find this energy difference arises from different ways of filling the possible tm sites in the respective orientation schemes . in the uniform - orientation scheme ,",
    "as the tm density is raised ( as part of the total density ) , tm atoms fill the ring 2.5 in the 13  decagon   before they exceed @xmath39 filling in the star cluster   tm sites ; whereas in the alternating - orientation case , the ring 2.5 is filled to a lesser degree with tm while the star cluster   tm sites become overfilled .",
    "[ in ref .",
    "@xcite , we gave an explanation how these effects could favour _ alternating _ orientations .",
    "] but the results just presented are valid only for the ( unphysical ! ) case of atoms confined to hop on fixed ideal sites .",
    "when displacements are allowed , so that many atoms `` pucker '' away from the flat layers ( see sec .  [ sec : rmr ] ) , then the uniform arrangement is preferred more robustly .",
    "up to this point , we reported simulations using fixed atom site positions .",
    "we can make our configurations more realistic by subjecting them to relaxation and molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "the removal of the tiling and discrete site list leads to effects such as out - of - layer `` puckering '' and so - called ` period doubling , ' whereby certain atoms relax into positions that violate the @xmath30 period of a single unit cell , but instead are periodic with respect to a unit cell with @xmath40 8.16 . exactly such distortions are familiar in the structures of decagonal phases and approximants .",
    "our standard cycle for such ` off - site ' studies is a relaxation to a local energy minimum ( i.e. to 0 k ) , followed by an md cycle beginning at @xmath41600 k and ending at @xmath4150k in increments of 50k .",
    "the md results are then relaxed again to 0k .",
    "this protocol will be denoted relaxation - md - relaxation ( rmr ) . upon relaxation to @xmath42 , we find that the tm atoms are quite immobile and move only slightly .",
    "the al atoms , however are subject to displacements as large as  @xmath43 . after molecular dynamics and re - relaxation to @xmath42 , we find a few al atoms be further displaced , but to similar sites so that no systematic difference is apparent in the overall pattern .",
    "major diffraction - based structure models were available for ` basic ni ' @xmath0(alnico ) , to which the simulation predictions could be compared , but no such model exists for the ` basic co ' @xmath0(alconi ) .",
    "however , the structure of the ` w phase ' crystal approximant of ` basic co ' has been determined by sugiyama _",
    "et al _  @xcite , and we may apply what we have learned so far  in particular the period doubling and puckering  to predict its structure .",
    "[ this study has inspired a more detailed modelling of w(alconi ) , based on ab - initio energies rather than pair potentials  @xcite .",
    "]    using exactly the same tiles and interlayer spacing as in our other simulations , our unit cell is @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 , which differs by less than 1% from the experimentally determined lattice constants .",
    "the approximate atom content implied by sugiyama s structure solution and co : ni ratio is al@xmath47co@xmath48ni@xmath49 , with uncertainties arising from the partial and mixed occupations . adopting this composition as our ideal",
    ", we have al@xmath50co@xmath51ni@xmath52 at a density 0.0714 @xmath36 .",
    "we applied our mock hamiltonian from sec .",
    "[ sec : inflated ] to generate a tiling consistent with the @xmath53 binary rhombus tiling .",
    "the optimum configuration is unique ( modulo symmetries ) and has four 13ds , in an arrangement which turns out to be the same as observed in in w(alconi ) .",
    "cluster orientation comparisons were like performed like those of subsec .",
    "[ sec : orientation ] , but using the relaxed energies ( without md ) .",
    "we found that , between the configurations with alternating and uniform cluster orientations , the latter had a lower relaxed energy , in accordance with the experimental w - alconi structure .",
    "the atomic locations generated on this unit cell using the 4 rhombus decoration site list is approximately consistent with the experimentally determined sites .",
    "our mmc simulations are able to capture the gross features of w - alconi with excellent accuracy . since this approximant is not far from the ` basic co ' decagonal composition",
    ", we are not surprised to find 13ds   and star clusters   as the major motifs , arranged in a manner consistent with our binary and @xmath12 tilings , consistent with the observed w - phase . the differences in the exact atomic locations lie mainly within the highly context dependent 2.5th and 3rd rings .",
    "we find that the increase in density from our original simulations results in a more dense occupation of these rings .",
    "atomic configurations found after rmr are in even better agreement . fig .",
    "[ fig : wa ] compares one layer from experimental data to our rmr results ; the match in the other layers are equally good .",
    "-axis dimension.,width=297 ]    however , a significant number of al atoms in our rmr picture are in disagreement with the experimental refinement . because certain puckered atoms are not present in our simulations .",
    "the top right of fig .",
    "[ fig : wa ] contains a pentagon of displaced al atoms centred upon the missing al atom .",
    "these extremely puckered al atoms are perhaps located in energy minima too far away for our md program to traverse .",
    "the existence of such atoms is one of the greatest flaws for beginning with a discrete site simulation .",
    "we find that in the approximate composition ( al@xmath1ni@xmath3co@xmath2 , the structure of @xmath0(alnico ) is dominated by the formation of the 13d   clusters and the star clusters   which complement them .",
    "we find that the gross features are robust under variations of the composition and densities of @xmath13% ; these will strongly affect a few details of the sites and we have not established the correct answers for those atoms .",
    "our method of tile decorations , and successive reductions of the degrees of freedom , affords an enormous speedup compared to brute - force molecular dynamics , which would get stuck in glassy configurations , at the price of a few plausible assumptions .    by applying our results to the approximant w - alconi",
    ", we demonstrated both the validity and the pitfalls of our approach .",
    "the pitfall lies in that fact that our explorations are conducted using a fixed site list in two atomic layers , whereas the real structure has four layers and some atoms are strongly puckered out of them .",
    "even though most puckered atoms may be represented as relaxations from ideal sites , the optimal puckered structure might be derived from a fixed - site structure of comparatively high energy that our simulations would pass over .",
    "reliable answers can not be obtained by pure numerical exploration , but seem to demand some physical understanding of the puckering ( and other displacements ) , as we have begun to do in ref .",
    "the context dependences evident in the ` basic co ' show that beyond a point , the errors in defining the pair potentials will surely exceed the energy differences due to some swaps of species , which is a second pitfall that may be alleviated only by checking against experimental phase diagrams .",
