    "the definition of topological charge density and of topological susceptibility on the lattice has by now a long story with contrasting results  @xcite .",
    "this paper intends to be a contribution to clarify the issue .",
    "lattice is a regulator of the theory",
    ". it should reproduce continuum physics in the limit in which the cutoff is removed , i.e. , in the limit in which the lattice spacing @xmath7 tends to zero . like any other regularization scheme , however , appropriate renormalizations have to be performed to determine physical quantities . within the rules of renormalization theory",
    "the topological charge density and its correlation functions can be defined on the lattice with the same rigour as for any other operator of the theory .    in qcd @xmath8 @xmath9",
    "has a fundamental physical role , being the anomaly of the @xmath10 singlet axial current @xmath11 @xmath12 is the number of light flavours .",
    "eq.([eq : anomaly ] ) provides a solution to the @xmath10 problem of gell ",
    "mann s quark model in which @xmath13 is conserved and the corresponding @xmath10 is a symmetry , whereas in hadron physics neither parity doublets are observed , which would correspond to a wigner realization , nor the inequality @xmath14 is satisfied , which would correspond to a spontaneous breaking  la goldstone .",
    "eq.([eq : anomaly ] ) could explain the higher value of @xmath15 as suggested by an approach based on @xmath16 expansion of the theory . at the leading order",
    "the anomaly is absent being @xmath17 , and @xmath10 is a goldstone symmetry like axial @xmath18 .",
    "the idea behind this expansion is that already at this order the theory describes the main physical features of hadrons ( e.g. confinement )  @xcite . in the @xmath16 expansion the anomaly acts as a perturbation , displacing the pole of the @xmath10 goldstone boson to the actual mass of the @xmath19 .",
    "the prediction is  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the topological susceptibility of the vacuum in the unperturbed ( @xmath22 ) theory .",
    "this means , among other facts , quenched approximation , fermion loops being @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , as we shall discuss in detail below , @xmath0 in eq.([eq : chi ] ) is not defined if the prescription is not specified for the singularity of the product @xmath24 as @xmath25 . in refs .",
    "@xcite the prescription which leads to eq.([eq : mass ] ) is the following @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the chern current @xmath28 related to @xmath9 by the equation @xmath29 the prescription eq.([eq : prescription ] ) eliminates all the @xmath30like singularities in the product @xmath31 as @xmath32 . in any regularization scheme",
    "the prescription eq.([eq : prescription ] ) only leaves a multiplicative renormalization @xmath33 for @xmath0 , @xmath34 being the possible renormalization of @xmath9 .",
    "( [ eq : gradient ] ) implies that the total topological charge @xmath35 has integer values .",
    "the regularized version of @xmath9 , @xmath36 , does not obey in general ( [ eq : gradient ] )  @xcite . according to the general rules of renormalization theory ( in pure gauge theory )",
    "@xmath37 in general @xmath38 unless eq .",
    "( [ eq : gradient ] ) is preserved by regularization . to determine @xmath34 it is sufficient to measure @xmath39 on a state belonging to a definite eigenvalue of @xmath40 ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the product @xmath41 will not satisfy the prescription eq .",
    "( [ eq : prescription ] ) in general at the singularity @xmath32 . in the limit",
    "@xmath42 it will differ from it by additive terms , @xmath43 , which can be classified by use of the wilson operator product expansion  @xcite . defining (",
    "@xmath44 is the 4volume ) @xmath45 we will have @xmath46 where the first term corresponds to the prescription eq .",
    "( [ eq : prescription ] ) . taking the v.e.v . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltachi ] ) gives @xmath47 with @xmath48 taking the expectation value of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltachi ] ) on eigenstates @xmath49 of @xmath40 gives @xmath50 it is a generally accepted wisdom that renormalization effects produced by short range quantum fluctuations are practically independent of the semiclassical instanton background which determines @xmath51 .",
    "the independence on @xmath51 of @xmath52 can be checked numerically by eq .",
    "( [ eq : qn ] ) and proves to be true within errors  @xcite .",
    "then @xmath53 , and @xmath54 can be determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : qn ] ) as @xmath55 , i.e. as expectation value of @xmath56 on the trivial topological sector .    from eq.([eq : reg1 ] ) @xmath57 it is with this prescription that @xmath0 is expected to be @xmath58 in the quenched approximation within an @xmath17 systematic error .",
    "in this paper we will show that , if the prescription eq.([eq : prescription ] ) is properly implemented , all methods which have been proposed to determine @xmath0 on the lattice give the same result .",
    "we shall do this by comparing the geometric method  @xcite to define @xmath9 to the field ",
    "theoretic one  @xcite for @xmath59 gauge theory .",
    "the same procedure , applied to @xmath60 indeed confirms  @xcite the expectation eq.([eq:180 ] ) .",
    "in analogy to any lattice operator , @xmath36 will be defined by the requirement that , in the formal ( nave ) limit @xmath42 @xmath61 a prototype definition is @xmath62 @xmath63 is the standard levi ",
    "civita tensor for positive directions while for negative ones the relation @xmath64 holds .",
    "@xmath65 irrelevant terms in eq.([eq : naive ] ) will dissapear in the scaling regime",
    ". however their presence may be used to improve the operator  @xcite . in",
    "what follows @xmath66 , @xmath67 will denote the operator defined by eq.([eq : qlattice ] ) and the once and twice improved versions of it respectively .",
    "improvement is the recursive smearing of the links developed in  @xcite .",
    "also the geometric definition @xmath68 satisfies eq.([eq : naive ] )  @xcite .    like any other regularized operator",
    ", @xmath36 will mix in the continuum limit , when irrelevant terms become unimportant , with all the operators having the same quantum numbers and lower or equal dimension .",
    "the only pseudoscalar of dimension @xmath69 being @xmath9 itself , @xmath70 the nave expectation for @xmath34 would be @xmath71 since @xmath40 , as an integer , should not renormalize . as first realised in  @xcite",
    "this is not true on the lattice where @xmath36 is not a divergence .",
    "@xmath34 can be computed in perturbation theory , as it was done in the early works on the subject  @xcite .",
    "a better way is to measure @xmath72 , @xmath73 being the total topological charge on the lattice , on a state on which @xmath40 has a known value , e.g. on a one  instanton state where @xmath74 .",
    "this can be done by a heating technique  @xcite where a background instanton is put by hand on the lattice , and quantum fluctuations at a given value of @xmath75 are added to it . in the continuum",
    "the instanton configuration is stable , being a minimum of the action , and therefore perturbing it by small fluctuations does not change the value of @xmath40 . on the lattice instantons are not stable , so that @xmath40 could change during this heating procedure .",
    "the way to avoid this inconvenience is to create a sample of configurations by the usual monte carlo updating , starting from the original instanton .",
    "each of them is checked in its instanton content by a rapid cooling : configurations where the original topological charge seems to be changed are discarded .",
    "this can be done after any number of heating steps and the result must be independent of this number .",
    "the result is a sample with topological charge @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath73 measured on this ensemble will reach a plateau in this heating procedure , on which @xmath34 can be read .",
    "if the instanton were stable , the plateau would stay flat forever .",
    "this procedure has been checked and used repeatedly within the field ",
    "theoretical method  @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath34 is shown in fig .  1 as a function of @xmath76 for different definitions of @xmath36 . the data for the 0 , 1 and 2smeared operators are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and are computed on a 1instanton configuration on a @xmath77 lattice .",
    "the data for the geometrical definition are new and are computed with the same procedure . for the geometric definition @xmath34",
    "is compatible with 1 ( within two standard deviations ) .",
    "however the values of @xmath78 have a large spread ( as large as @xmath79 ) showing that it can assume values different from the original @xmath40 on configurations which are presumed to belong to that sector . only the average satisfies",
    "@xmath80 , but not the value configuration by configuration .",
    "moreover , on a given configuration the value of @xmath78 depends on the interpolation used to define it  @xcite .",
    "the lattice topological susceptibility is written as @xmath81 and analogously for @xmath78 . to make connection to the continuum susceptibility as defined by eq.([eq : prescription ] ) , in general there will be an additive renormalization due to the singularity at @xmath32 and a multiplicative residual renormalization @xmath82 which will simply be the square of @xmath34 computed in the previous section .    as a matter of fact @xmath83",
    "is expected to be negative due to reflection positivity at @xmath84 since @xmath36 changes its sign under time reversal  @xcite .",
    "in fact this holds at distances larger than the extension of the operator if it is smeared .",
    "figs .  2  and  3",
    "show that this is indeed the case both for the geometric operator and the field  theoretical definition .",
    "since @xmath85 is positive , its value is determined mainly by the point at @xmath86 , i.e. by the singularity of the product at @xmath25 .",
    "this peak is there , no matter how @xmath36 is defined , and its height depends on the definition used . in figs .  2  and  3 the values for @xmath83",
    "have been summed over all points @xmath87 inside a shell at distance @xmath88 from the origin @xmath86 .",
    "the width of this shell was @xmath89 .",
    "thus in general  @xcite @xmath90 @xmath91 will describe a mixing with all scalar operators of dimension @xmath69 ( @xmath92 is the beta function ) , @xmath93 @xmath94 is the value of @xmath54 in eq.([eq : reg1 ] ) in the lattice regularization .    to match the prescription of eq.([eq : prescription ] ) , @xmath0 has to be zero in the sector @xmath95 . in that sector",
    "thus @xmath96 and @xmath91 can be determined by measuring @xmath56 in it .",
    "this is again done by a heating procedure  @xcite .",
    "the flat , zero field configuration , ( @xmath97 ) can be dressed with local quantum fluctuations , which do not change its topological content , by the usual updating procedure at the desired value of @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath56 will soon reach a plateau : if the sector were stable the plateau would persist forever . instead",
    "non  vanishing topological charge can be created on the lattice and care must be taken to eliminate configurations where this happens . again",
    "this must be done by cooling and checks can be done to test the consistency of the procedure .",
    "4 shows the determination of @xmath91 for the geometric definition and for three different field  theoretical definitions .",
    "analogously to eq.([eq : reg2 ] ) , from eq.([eq : chil ] ) we obtain @xmath98 @xmath56 , @xmath94 and @xmath34 depend on the choice of the regulator as well as on the choice of the action ; @xmath7 depends on the choice of the action but @xmath0 must be independent of all of it .",
    "5 shows that this is the case . in this figure",
    "we have used the data of ref .",
    "@xcite for the 0 and 2smeared field ",
    "theoretical charges . the data for the geometric definition has been obtained on a @xmath77 lattice with the same updating procedure ( heat bath ) and compatible statistics ( 5000 configurations ) .",
    "the result of the simulations is in fact @xmath99 .",
    "usually people determine @xmath100 by computing the string tension @xmath101 and by assuming the physical value for @xmath102 .",
    "this allows to express @xmath103 in physical units .",
    "we do same in order to compare our result with other people s determinations .",
    "the scale is determined from the data of  @xcite .",
    "the data at 2smearings yield @xmath104 mev for @xmath59 gauge group , the first error being statistical and the second one coming from the error in @xmath105 .",
    "the `` nave '' unsubtracted geometric definition does not scale and is almost one order of magnitude larger than the subtracted value . in the jargon of the geometrical method",
    "this is called an effect of dislocations .",
    "it is the mixing to the identity operator which indeed describes these dislocations , having dimension lower than 4 .",
    "there is however an additional mixing in eq.([eq : mixing ] ) which has the same dimension as @xmath0 and still must be subtracted : checking only by dimension is not sufficient to ensure that @xmath56 is indeed equal to the physical @xmath0 , as defined by eq.([eq : prescription ] ) .",
    "6  and  7 show the distribution of values for @xmath73 in the sector with trivial topology .",
    "its variance is , apart from a normalization factor , a measure of @xmath91 .",
    "a good operator @xmath36 is one for which the subtraction @xmath91 is small compared to @xmath56 . on the other hand , also having @xmath106 is more reassuring than having a small @xmath34",
    ".    table i shows @xmath56 , @xmath34 and @xmath94 for the 0 , 1 , 2smeared field ",
    "theoretical charges and the geometric charge at @xmath107 .",
    "the 2smeared definition of @xmath36 is the best among these choices .",
    "the geometric definition is good with respect to @xmath34 but is definitively bad with respect to the additive renormalization @xmath94 .",
    "the main conclusion of the above analysis is that with any definition of topological charge density on the lattice , an additive renormalization for the topological susceptibility and a multiplicative one are necessary .",
    "if properly renormalized all definitions bring about the same physical value for @xmath0 .",
    "confusion on this subject in the past was generated by a mistreatment of renormalization .",
    "on the one hand , the geometric definition was believed to be free from renormalizations because it gave always integer values for the total topological charge .",
    "this seems to be true for the multiplicative renormalization .",
    "having integer values , however , does not exempt from having singularities at short distance in the product which defines @xmath56 .",
    "5 is clearly proving that .    the field ",
    "theoretical definition started as a nave definition .",
    "@xmath34 was not noticed and put equal to 1 ; @xmath108 was subtracted by use of perturbation theory . as a result @xmath109",
    "was determined instead of @xmath0 itself , and found to be much smaller than the expectation eq.([eq:180 ] )  @xcite .",
    "the idea was then put forward that the nave definition might not be correct and the geometric method  @xcite , the cooling method  @xcite and the atiyah  singer based methods  @xcite were developed .",
    "the nave method was promoted to field ",
    "theoretic method only after introducing @xmath34 and a correct subtraction @xmath94  @xcite .",
    "the non  perturbative determinations of these constants  @xcite as explained above , finally brought about a reliable determination of @xmath0 , which is indeed regulator independent .",
    "the cooling method authomatically performs the additive subtraction because it gives @xmath110 on the trivial sector ; and also brings @xmath34 to 1 by freezing the quantum fluctuations . the problem with it was that instantons could be lost in the procedure , leading to an underestimation of @xmath0 .",
    "cooling with improved forms of the action  @xcite seems to have eliminated this problem and gives indeed results which confirm the field ",
    "theoretic determination .",
    "the same seems to be true for the modern versions of the atiyah ",
    "singer procedure  @xcite .",
    "we are greatly indebted to cnuce ( pisa ) for qualified technical assistance in the use of their ibm  sp2 and to the crt computer center of enel ( pisa ) for warm hospitality and collaboration in the use of their cray ymp2e .",
    "we also thank gerrit schierholz for providing us with the vectorized fortran code for the geometrical topological charge and pietro menotti for clarifying discussions about the reflection positivity .",
