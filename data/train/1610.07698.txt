    ".    our main tool to study the singular sdes in this work will be the fundamental solution of the operator @xmath12 .",

    "we point out that the estimate ( [ f2 ] ) seems to be new in all the works mentioned above , which means that the function @xmath19 has @xmath48- order regularity in @xmath32 with @xmath49 .",

    "then , for each @xmath74 , there exists a unique strong solution @xmath75 to sde ( [ sde1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath75 admits a density function @xmath19 which enjoys all the properties stated in the conclusions of theorem [ main1 ] .",
    "notice that the drift coefficient is singular enough so that the deterministic ordinary equation of ( [ sde1 ] ) with @xmath76 is not well - posed .",
    "the fact that noises may produce regularization effects which make ill - posed deterministic systems well - posed has attracted a lot of attentions in the past decades . a remarkable result of n. v. krylov and m. rckner @xcite shows that under the condition @xmath77 with @xmath78 there exists a unique strong solution for every @xmath74 to the following sde : @xmath79 later on , this was extended by zhang @xcite to the multiplicative noise @xmath80 under the assumption that @xmath65 is uniformly continuous in @xmath32 , bounded and uniformly elliptic and @xmath81 with @xmath82 satisfy ( [ pq ] ) , where @xmath8 donets the weak detivative of @xmath65 with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the situation for sdes with pure jump lvy noises is more delicate .",
    "let @xmath83 be a symmetric @xmath84-stable process with non - degenerate spectral measure and consider the following sde : @xmath85 when @xmath86 and @xmath37 is @xmath87-hlder continuous with @xmath88 it was proved by priola @xcite that there exists a unique strong solution @xmath75 to sde ( [ levy ] ) for each @xmath74 .",
    "zhang @xcite extended this result when @xmath89 and allowing @xmath37 in some fractional sobolev space .",
    "see also @xcite for related results .",
    "recently , @xcite considered the same sdes as ( [ sde1 ] ) with the lvy measure given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 satisfies ( [ nu ] ) and @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we fill the gap in the critical case @xmath92 in this paper .",
    "compared with @xcite , we shall use directly the estimates of fundamental solution in the whole procedure .",
    "it seems the first time that kato functions which are commonly used in the study of heat kernel estimates are bringed to the study of strong solutions for singular sdes .",
    "our approach can also be adapted to sdes driven by multiplicative brownian motion .",
    "another advantage of our method is that , as an consequence of ( [ eq17 ] ) and theorem [ main2 ] , we can derive the following estimate of the semigroup corresponding to @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath93 be the unique strong solution to sde ( [ sde1 ] ) and @xmath94 be the corresponding semigroup .",
    "then , @xmath93 is strong feller and @xmath95 is a positive constant .    in general , for sde ( [ sde1 ] ) , it is not easy to deduce the strong feller property as well as the derivative formula for the corresponding semigroup even if the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath37 belong to @xmath96 .",
    "the trouble is caused by the term @xmath97}$ ] , which is not differentiable even though @xmath65 is smooth .",
    "here , we easily get the estimate ( [ 88 ] ) through the fundamental solution estimates .",
    "let us specify the main difficulties of the proof .",
    "as is well known now , the basic idea of the proof for the pathwise uniqueness of singular sdes is based on the the zvonkin s transformation , which require suitable analytic regularity results of certain elliptic equations corresponding to the generators of the strong solutions .",
    "notice that @xcite are all restricted to the additive lvy noise . in this circumstances ,",
    "one only needs to deal with the symmetric operator @xmath98 defined by @xmath99\\nu(\\dif z),\\quad\\forall f\\in c_0^\\infty(\\mr^d),\\ ] ] which is the generator of @xmath100 .",
    "the analysis in @xcite relies heavily on the symmetric property of @xmath98 and the @xmath101-smoothing property of its semigroup .",
    "however , the operator @xmath7 in our paper is not symmetric , critical and more important , its semigroup has only @xmath102 regularity as indicated by ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we need to use more delicate analysis to fit our less regularity property into the frame of zvonkin s transformation .",
    "another difficult comes from the new extra term @xmath103}(r)$ ] .",
    "we need to use a trick of @xmath104-estimate by kurtz @xcite rather than the @xmath105-estimate as usual when proving our main theorem .",
    "some new challenges appear when dealing with the @xmath104-estimate and the irregular coefficients , see also @xcite .",
    "last but not least , it is clear that the assumption ( [ a1 ] ) is a generalization of ( [ kur ] ) . here",
    ", we would like to give the following important comment .    in view of ( [ incl ] ) below",
    ", we can take @xmath106 with @xmath107 , @xmath39 and @xmath108 with @xmath109 , where @xmath8 denotes the weak derivative .",
    "the interesting thing is that for sde , if @xmath65 is independent of the time variable @xmath110 , one has to assume that @xmath111 with @xmath109 , see ( [ pq ] ) and ( [ multi ] ) .",
    "so one may guess reasonably that for sdes driven by multiplicative @xmath84-stable noise , one has to assume that the diffusion coefficients satisfies @xmath112 with @xmath113 . here",
    ", we only need the index @xmath109 , the point is that @xmath65 appears in the indicator function @xmath103}(r)$ ] .",
    "this paper proceed as follows : in section 2 we construct the fundamental solution for the operator @xmath12 and give the proof of theorem [ main1 ] .",
    "meanwhile , we study the smoothing properties of the corresponding semigroup , which will play an essential role . in section 3",
    ", we prove our main result theorem [ main2 ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the following convention : @xmath114 with or without subscripts will denote a positive constant , whose value may change in different places , and whose dependence on parameters can be traced from calculations .",
    "we write @xmath115 to mean that there exists a constant @xmath116 such that @xmath117 ; and @xmath118 to mean that there exist @xmath119 such that @xmath120 .",
    "to shorten the notation , we set for @xmath121 , @xmath122 let @xmath123 be the usual beta function defined by @xmath124 the following result which is called the @xmath125p - inequality was proved in ( * ? ?",
