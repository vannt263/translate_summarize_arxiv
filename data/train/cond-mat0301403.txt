    "despite decades of intensive investigation , the statistical mechanics of systems with both quenched disorder and frustration remains an open problem . among such systems ,",
    "the spin glass is arguably the prototype , and inarguably the most studied .",
    "spin glasses are systems in which competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions among localized magnetic moments ( or more colloquially , `` spins '' ) leads to a magnetically disordered state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ground ] ) .",
    "the prime example of a metallic spin glass is a dilute magnetic alloy , in which a magnetic impurity ( typically fe or mn ) is randomly diluted within a nonmagnetic metallic host , typically a noble metal .",
    "the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions arises in these systems from the rkky interactions @xcite between the localized spins , mediated by the conduction electrons .",
    "[ fig : ground ]    but many other types of spin glass , with different microscopic mechanisms for their `` spin glass - like '' behavior , exist .",
    "certain insulators , in which low concentrations of magnetic impurities are randomly substituted for nonmagnetic atoms , also display spin glass behavior .",
    "a well - known example @xcite is eu@xmath0sr@xmath1s , with @xmath2 roughly between .1 and .5 , where the competition arises largely from nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic and next - nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "there are many other materials that exhibit spin glass behavior , both metallic and insulating , crystalline and amorphous .",
    "they can display ising , planar , or heisenberg behavior , and come in both classical and quantum varieties . in this review",
    "we consider only classical spin glasses @xcite .",
    "what are the main experimental features of spin glasses ?",
    "one is the presence of a cusp in the low - field ac susceptibility ( fig .",
    "2 ) , as first observed in _ au_fe alloys by cannella and mydosh @xcite . this cusp becomes progressively rounded as the external magnetic field increases @xcite .",
    "the specific heat , however , rather than showing a similar singularity , typically displays a broad maximum ( fig .",
    "3 ) at temperatures somewhat higher than the `` freezing temperature '' @xmath3 defined via the susceptibility peak ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : susc ]    [ fig : cm ]    probes of the low - temperature magnetic structure using neutron scattering , mssbauer studies , nmr and other techniques confirm the absence of long - range spatial order coupled with the presence of temporal order insofar as the spin orientations appear to be frozen on the timescale of the experiment .",
    "an extensive description of these and related experiments are presented in the review article by binder and young @xcite .",
    "spin glasses are also characterized by a host of irreversible and non - equilibrium behaviors , including remanence , hysteresis , anomalously slow relaxation , aging and related phenomena . because this review will focus on static equilibrium behavior",
    ", these topics will not be treated here , but it is important to note that explaining these phenomena are essential to any deeper understanding of spin glasses . for reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the quest to attain a theoretical understanding of spin glasses has followed a tortuous path , and to this day many of the most basic and fundamental issues remain unresolved .",
    "an extensive discussion of theoretical ideas can be found in a number of reviews @xcite .",
    "the good news is that research into spin glasses has uncovered a variety of novel and sometimes stunning concepts ; the bad news is that it is not clear how many of these apply to real spin glasses themselves . in this review",
    "we will explore some of these issues , in particular the nature of ordering and broken symmetry in the putative spin glass phase .    as a first step",
    ", one needs to capture mathematically the absence of orientational spin ordering in space with the presence of frozenness , or order in time .",
    "this was achieved early on by edwards and anderson ( ea ) @xcite , who noted that a low temperature pure phase of spin glasses should be characterized by a vanishing magnetization per spin @xmath4 accompanied by a nonvanishing `` ea order parameter '' ( as it is now called ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spin at site @xmath2 , @xmath7 is a cube of side @xmath8 centered at the origin , and @xmath9 denotes a thermal average .",
    "however , it was later discovered that , while the ea order parameter @xmath10 plays a central role in describing the spin glass phase , it is insufficient to describe the low temperature ordering  at least in a mean - field version of the problem . in the following sections we will explain this statement , explore the relationship between the mean - field spin glass problem and its short - ranged version , and discuss some new and general insights and tools that may turn out to be useful in unraveling the complexities of the statistical mechanics of inhomogeneous systems .",
    "questions regarding spin glass behavior fall naturally into two classes : the first pertains to properties of a system in thermal equilibrium , and the second to those related to nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "it is still not certain whether spin glasses possess nontrivial equilibrium properties , but their nonequilibrium ones surely are .",
    "as already noted , throughout this review we will focus primarily on spin glasses in thermal equilibrium .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental question that can be asked is whether there exists such a thing as a true , thermodynamic spin glass phase ; that is , is there a sharp phase transition from the high - temperature paramagnetic state to a low - temperature spin glass state in zero external magnetic field ?",
    "of course , this is presumably the simplest transition that could in principle occur ; one could also ask about field - induced transitions , ferromagnetic to spin glass transitions , and others . but given that all of these questions remain open , we ll confine our attention here to the simplest of these . and even here , although experimental and numerical studies have tended to favor an affirmative answer , the issue is by no means resolved .      in order to proceed ,",
    "we need a specific model to study .",
    "the majority of theoretical investigations begin with a hamiltonian proposed by edwards and anderson @xcite : @xmath11 where ( to keep things as general as possible ) @xmath2 is a site in a @xmath12-dimensional cubic lattice , @xmath6 is the spin at site @xmath2 , the spin couplings @xmath13 are independent , identically distributed random variables , @xmath14 is an external magnetic field , and the first sum is over nearest neighbor sites only .",
    "we will usually take the spins to be ising variables , i.e. , @xmath15 . throughout most of the paper",
    "we will choose @xmath16 and the spin couplings @xmath13 to be symmetrically distributed about zero ; as a result , the ea hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ea ] ) has global spin inversion symmetry .",
    "popular choices for the distribution of the couplings @xmath13 are bimodal and gaussian .",
    "most of what we discuss below will be independent of which of these is chosen , but for specificity ( and to avoid accidental degeneracies when discussing ground states ) we will choose the couplings from a gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance one .",
    "it is important to note the the disorder is _ quenched _ : once chosen , the couplings are fixed for all time .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 a particular realization of the couplings , corresponding physically to a specific spin glass sample .",
    "proper averaging over quenched disorder is done on extensive quantities only @xcite , i.e. , at the level of @xmath18 rather than @xmath19 , where @xmath19 is the partition function .",
    "of course , the ea hamiltonian looks nothing like a faithful microscopic description of spin interactions in a dilute magnetic alloy , or an insulator like eu@xmath0sr@xmath1s  and because the statistical mechanics of the ea hamiltonian remain to be worked out , a direct comparison with experiment remains elusive",
    ". however , a central assertion of @xcite is that the essential physics of spin glasses is the competition between quenched ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions , regardless of microscopic details ; and so the ea hamiltonian remains the usual launching point for theoretical analyses of real spin glasses .      a striking feature of random - bond models like the ea spin glass is the presence of _ frustration _ , in this case meaning the inability of any spin configuration to simultaneously satisfy all couplings .",
    "it is easily verified that , in any dimension larger than one , all of the spins along any closed circuit @xmath20 in the edge lattice can not be simultaneously satisfied if @xmath21    the definition of frustration given above was first suggested by toulouse @xcite .",
    "a different formulation due to anderson @xcite received less notice when it was first proposed , but its underlying ideas may prove useful in more recent spin glass research .",
    "the basic notion is that frustration manifests itself as free energy fluctuations ( e.g. , with a change in boundary conditions from periodic to antiperiodic ) that scale as the _ square root _ of the surface area of a typical sample .    hence the spin glass is characterized by both _ quenched disorder _ and _ frustration_. the presence of frustration , leading to a complicated geometry of entangled frustration contours , suggests the possibility that spin glasses , in at least some dimensions , may possess multiple infinite - volume ground or pure states unrelated by any simple symmetry transformation .",
    "we will return to this question later .",
    "we note here , though , that there exists at least one ( unrealistic ) spin glass model where the number of ground states can be computed in all finite dimensions .",
    "this is the _ highly disordered model _ of the authors @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in which the coupling magnitudes scale nonlinearly with the volume ( and so are no longer distributed independently of the volume , although they remain independent and identically distributed for each volume ) .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that there exists a _",
    "transition _ in ground state multiplicity in this model : below eight dimensions , it has only a single ( globally spin reversed ) pair of ground states , while above eight it has uncountably many ground state pairs .",
    "interestingly , the high - dimensional ground state multiplicity can be shown to be _ unaffected _ by the presence of frustration , although frustration still plays an interesting role : it leads to the appearance of _ chaotic size dependence _ , to be discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : csd ] .",
    "mean field models often provide a useful first step towards understanding the low - temperature phase of a condensed matter system ; in the case of spin glasses , the usual procedure seems to have taken a particularly interesting twist .",
    "the mean field theory of spin glasses turns out to be far more intricate than those of most homogeneous systems , and as a result several different approaches have been tried . also noteworthy are even simpler , soluble spin glass - like models , in particular the random energy model of derrida @xcite .",
    "however , here we will confine ourselves to a discussion of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite , an infinite - ranged version of the ea model in which mean field theory is presumably exact .",
    "the sk hamiltonian for a system of @xmath22 spins is ( as usual , we take external field to be zero ) : @xmath23 where we again take the spins to be ising and choose the ( independent , identically distributed ) couplings @xmath24 from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance one ; the latter rescaling ensures a sensible thermodynamic limit for free energy per spin and other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this model has a sharp phase transition at @xmath25 .",
    "at this temperature the static susceptibility has a cusp  but so does the specific heat .    sk solved for the low - temperature spin glass phase , using the ea order parameter to describe the broken symmetry .",
    "however , their solution was unstable @xcite ; in particular , the entropy was found to become negative at sufficiently low temperature .",
    "the following four years saw intensive efforts to solve for the low - temperature phase of the sk model .",
    "of particular note is the direct mean field approach of thouless , anderson , and palmer @xcite , who pointed out the necessity of including the onsager reaction field term , and the paper by dealmeida and thouless @xcite , who studied the stability of the sk solution in the @xmath26-@xmath14 plane and calculated the boundary between the regions where a single ( i.e. , paramagnetic ) phase is stable and the region where the low - temperature phase resides .",
    "one important question that remains open to this day is whether such an `` at line '' exists for more realistic models ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : magnetic ] for further discussion ) .",
    "we will mainly focus , however , on what is today believed to be the correct solution for the low - temperature phase of the sk model . in a series of papers , parisi and collaborators",
    "@xcite proposed , and worked out the consequences of , an extraordinary _ ansatz _ for the nature of this phase . following the mathematical procedures underlying the solution , it came to be known as _ replica symmetry breaking _ ( rsb ) .",
    "we will not review those mathematical procedures here ; they are worked out in detail in several review articles and books ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will also omit discussion of important related developments , such as the dynamical interpretation of sompolinsky and zippelius @xcite .",
    "we will concern ourselves instead with both the physical and mathematical interpretations of the parisi solution , and the type of ordering that it implies .",
    "these interpretations took several years to work out , culminating in the work of mezard _",
    "@xcite that introduced the ideas of overlaps , non - self - averaging , and ultrametricity as a means of understanding the type of order implied by the parisi solution .",
    "these terms , and their relevance for the parisi solution , will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : mft ] . for",
    "now , we simply note that the solution of the infinite - ranged sk model generated tremendous excitement ; as described by rammal _",
    "@xcite , it displayed a new type of broken symmetry `` radically different from all previously known '' .",
    "this is not an overstatement .",
    "the starting point is the observation that the low - temperature phase consists not of a single spin - reversed pair of states , but rather `` infinitely many pure thermodynamic states '' @xcite , not related by any simple symmetry transformations .",
    "this possibility had already been foreshadowed by the thouless - anderson - palmer approach @xcite , whose mean - field equations were known to have many solutions ( not necessarily all free energy minima , except at zero temperature @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of many states meant that the correct order parameter needed to reflect their presence , and to describe the relations among them .",
    "the single ea order parameter was therefore insufficient to describe the low - temperature phase ( although it retained an important role , as we ll see ) ; instead one needed an order parameter _",
    "function_.    before we describe these ideas in more detail , we will first step back and consider the basic outline of the problem that interests us .",
    "in particular , we need to ask : what is it that we want to know ? what are the fundamental open questions ? and how do they tie in with the broader areas of condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics ? these questions will be considered in the following section .",
    "in this review we concern ourselves with perhaps the most basic questions that can be asked : is there a true spin glass phase , and if so , what is its nature ?    for the infinite - ranged sk model , these questions",
    "appear largely resolved , though some open questions remain . for the ea model ( as a representative of more general `` realistic '' models , i.e. , finite - dimensional and non - infinite - ranged )",
    ", the primary question of whether a thermodynamic phase transition exists remains open .",
    "there is suggestive analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite evidence that a phase transition to a broken spin - flip symmetric phase is present in three - dimensional and , even more likely , in four - dimensional ising spin glasses .",
    "however , no one has yet been able to prove or disprove the existence of a phase transition , and the issue remains unsettled @xcite .",
    "of course , existence of a phase transition does not necessarily imply more than a single low - temperature phase ; one could , for example , have a transition above which correlations decay exponentially and below which they decay as a power law , with @xmath27 at all nonzero temperatures .",
    "however , most numerical simulations and theoretical pictures that point to a low - temperature spin glass phase suggest broken spin - flip symmetry . we are therefore led to :    _ open question 1 .",
    "_ does the ea ising model have an equilibrium phase transition above some lower critical dimension @xmath28 ; and if so , does the low - temperature phase have broken spin - flip symmetry ?    if the answer to this question turns out to be no , then subsequent research will need to focus on dynamical behavior , which  as in ordinary glasses  presents a range of difficult and important problems .",
    "however , given the reasonable possibility that there is indeed a sharp phase transition , it is worthwhile to ask :    _ if there is a phase transition for the ea ising model at some @xmath29 , what is the nature of the ordering of the low - temperature phase ? _    because of the open - ended nature of this question , it wo nt be assigned a number ; instead , we ll break it down into several parts .",
    "the remaining questions assume that there is an equilibrium phase transition critical temperature @xmath30 , below which there is broken spin - flip symmetry ( equivalently , a phase with @xmath31 ) , but we make no assumptions as to whether @xmath28 is less than or equal to three .    _ open question 2 .",
    "_ what is the number of equilibrium pure state pairs ( at nonzero temperature ) and ground state pairs ( at zero temperature ) in the spin glass phase ?",
    "we have seen that the mean - field rsb picture assumes infinitely many such pairs .",
    "a competing picture , known as the droplet / scaling picture , due to macmillan , bray and moore , fisher and huse , and others @xcite , asserts that there is only a single pair of pure / ground states in the spin glass phase in _ any _ finite dimension .",
    "because of the importance of this picture , we discuss it briefly here . `` domain wall renormalization group '' studies @xcite led to a scaling ansatz @xcite that in turn led to the development of a corresponding physical droplet picture @xcite for spin glasses . in this picture ,",
    "thermodynamic and dynamic properties at low temperature are dominated by low - lying excitations corresponding to clusters of coherently flipped spins .",
    "the density of states of these clusters at zero energy falls off as a power law in lengthscale @xmath8 , with exponent bounded from above by @xmath32 . at low temperatures and on large lengthscales",
    "the thermally activated clusters form a dilute gas and can be considered as non - interacting two - level systems . the resulting two - state picture ( in which there is no nontrivial replica symmetry breaking ) is therefore significantly different from the mean - field picture arising from the sk model .",
    "so do spin glasses in finite dimensions have many equilibrium states or a single pair ?",
    "except in the highly disordered model @xcite , the answer is not known . in one dimension ( where there is no internal frustration )",
    ", there is only a single pair of ground states , and a single paramagnetic phase at all nonzero temperatures . in an infinite number of dimensions",
    ", there presumably would be an infinite number of pure state pairs for @xmath33 .",
    "recent numerical experiments @xcite _ seem _ to indicate a single pair of ground states in two dimensions ( where it is believed that @xmath34 ) , but given that lattice sizes studied are still not very large , the question is not completely settled .",
    "recent rigorous work by the authors @xcite has led to a partial result that supports the notion that only a single pair of ground states occurs in two dimensions . in three dimensions",
    "numerical simulations give conflicting results @xcite .    while the mean - field - like rsb many - state picture and the two - state droplet / scaling picture",
    "have historically been the main competing pictures , there are others as well .",
    "at least one of these will be discussed later .",
    "one often sees in the literature an unspoken assumption that the presence of many states is synonymous with rsb , and similarly that the presence of only a single pair is equivalent to droplet / scaling .",
    "we emphasize , however , that while these are _ necessary _ requirements for each picture , respectively , they are not sufficient : each has considerable additional structure ( which , in the mean - field rsb case , will be discussed in the next section ) .",
    "this then leads to our next question :    _ question 3 .",
    "_ if there do exist infinitely many equilibrium states in some dimensions and at some temperatures , are they organized according to the mean - field rsb picture ?",
    "treatment of this question is the main theme of the remainder of this review .",
    "a series of both rigorous and heuristic results , due to the authors , has largely answered this question in the negative , and it is therefore not listed as open .",

    "[ subsec : possibilities ] .    in discussing this",
    ", we will not consider every logical alternative to the mean - field picture , but rather what we consider to be the most likely remaining scenarios for the low - temperature phase of finite - dimensional spin glasses .",
    "the discussion so far has considered only equilibrium pure or ground states , with a view towards determining the nature of broken symmetry in realistic spin glasses . however",
    ", a more general discussion of thermodynamics and dynamics , particularly with a view towards explaining experimental observations , needs to include questions about other types of states , such as :    _ question 5 . _",
    "how are energetically low - lying excitations above the ground state(s ) characterized ?",
    "( sec .  [ subsec : excitations ] . )    _ question 6 .",
    "_ what can be proven about numbers and overlaps of metastable states ?",
    "do they have any connection(s ) to thermodynamic pure states ?",
    "( sec .  [",
    "subsec : metastable ] . )",
    "although many other important questions remain open , we close here with a question of more general interest than for spin glass physics alone :    _ question 7 .",
    "_ in what ways do we now understand how the statistical mechanical treatment of frustrated , disordered systems differs in fundamental ways from that of homogeneous systems ?",
    "( sec .  [ subsec : statmech ] . )",
    "we now return to a more detailed discussion of the nature of ordering implied by parisi s solution of the sk model . as noted in sec .",
    "[ subsec : sk ] , the rsb scheme introduced by parisi assumes the existence of many equilibrium pure states .",
    "because the notion of pure states has generated some confusion in the literature , we detour to clarify exactly what is meant by this and related terms .",
    "the discussion here closely follows appendix  a of @xcite .",
    "the notion of pure states is well - defined for short - ranged , finite - dimensional systems , but is less clear for infinite - ranged ones like the sk model .",
    "we therefore begin with a discussion of the ea model ( in arbitrary @xmath35 ) , and then briefly discuss application of these ideas to the sk model .",
    "consider first @xmath36 , the ea hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ea ] ) restricted to a finite volume of linear extent @xmath8 .",
    "we will always take such a volume , hereafter denoted as @xmath7 , to be an @xmath37 cube centered at the origin .",
    "in addition , we need to impose boundary conditions , which we will often take to be periodic ; other possibilities include antiperiodic , free , fixed ( e.g. , all spins on the boundary set equal to @xmath38 ) , and so on . given a specified boundary condition , the finite - volume gibbs state @xmath39 on @xmath7 at temperature @xmath26 is defined by : @xmath40 where the partition function @xmath41 is such that the sum of @xmath39 over all spin configurations in @xmath7 yields one .",
    "all equilibrium quantities of interest can be computed from @xmath42 , which is simply a probability measure : it describes at fixed @xmath26 the probability of a given spin configuration obeying the specified boundary condition appearing within @xmath7 .",
    "such a ( well - behaved ) probability distribution is completely specified by its moments , which in this case is the set of all correlation functions within @xmath7 : @xmath43 for arbitrary @xmath44 and arbitrary @xmath45 .",
    "consider next the @xmath46 limit of a sequence of such finite - volume gibbs states @xmath47 , each with a specified boundary condition ( which may remain the same or may change with @xmath8 ) .",
    "of course , such a sequence may or may not have a limit ; existence of a limit would require that every @xmath44-spin correlation function , for @xmath48 , itself possesses a limit @xcite .",
    "a _ thermodynamic _",
    "state @xmath49 is therefore an _ infinite_-volume gibbs measure , providing information such as the probability of any finite subset of spins taking on specified values ; and of course it determines global properties such as magnetization per spin , energy per spin , and so on .",
    "thermodynamic states may or may not be mixtures of other thermodynamic states . if a thermodynamic state @xmath49 can be decomposed according to @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are also thermodynamic states ( distinct from @xmath54 ) , then @xmath49 is a _ mixed _",
    "thermodynamic state or simply , mixed state .",
    "the meaning of the decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixed ] ) is easily understood : it simply means that any correlation function computed using @xmath49 can be decomposed as : @xmath55 a mixed state may or may not be further decomposed into as many as an uncountable infinity of disjoint other states .",
    "we are now ready to define the idea of a thermodynamic pure state .",
    "if a distinct thermodynamic state can not be written as a convex combination of any other thermodynamic states , it is then a thermodynamic _ pure _ state , or simply pure state .",
    "so the paramagnetic state is a pure state , as are each of the positive and negative magnetization states in the ising ferromagnet .",
    "in that system at @xmath33 , the gibbs state produced by a sequence of increasing volumes , with either periodic or free boundary conditions , is a mixed state , decomposable into the positive and negative magnetization states each with @xmath56 . on the other hand",
    ", a sequence of increasing volumes with all boundary spins fixed at @xmath38 leads to the positive magnetization pure state .",
    "a thermodynamic , or infinite - volume , _ ground _ state is a pure state at zero temperature consisting of a single spin configuration , with the property that its energy can not be lowered by flipping any finite subset of spins @xcite .",
    "a pure state @xmath57 can be intrinsically characterized by a _ clustering property _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which implies that for any fixed @xmath2 , @xmath58 and similar clustering for higher order correlations .    without getting into technical details ,",
    "it is already clear that a problem exists with extending the concept of pure ( or for that matter thermodynamic ) state to the sk model .",

    "the problem with this is that there may be no measurable ( i.e. , effective ) way to construct such a state ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : csd ] below ) .    for",
    "now , we will ignore such difficulties and use the terms `` pure state '' , `` thermodynamic state '' , and so on , for the sk model also , as has been done extensively in the physics literature .",

    "[ sec : csd ] ) . note that some of the difficulties discussed here are not present in the curie - weiss model of the uniform ferromagnet .",
    "although couplings scale to zero there also , they `` reinforce '' each other , being nonrandom , so that @xmath59 positive and negative magnetization states still make sense .",
    "it turns out that this fundamental difference between finite and infinite systems in the _ disordered _ case will have profound consequences .      as noted in sec .",

    "because there is no spatial structure in the infinite - ranged model , the overlap function does seem to capture the essential relations among the different states .",

    "quantities referring to individual pure states are problematic , since there is no known procedure for constructing such things in the sk model . however , what is really of interest is the _ distribution _ of overlaps ; i.e. , if one randomly and independently chooses two pure states from @xmath70 in eq .",

    "a second difficulty , also alluded to in sec .",
    "[ subsec : pure ] , is the question of how one could actually construct a pure state in either the sk _ or _ the ea model . in homogeneous systems like the uniform ferromagnet , this presents no difficulties : to select out the positively magnetized pure state , for example , one could either introduce a bulk term ( a positive , homogeneous external field ) whose magnitude goes to zero , or a surface term ( fixed boundary condition consisting of all plus spins ) , with volume going to infinity .",

    ", we will arrive at a deeper understanding of the meaning and consequences of the existence of many states in disordered materials ; and we will simultaneously achieve a clearer , and deeper , understanding of the meaning and significance of the parisi solution for the sk model .",
    "the first step is showing the connection between the existence of multiple states and the presence of what we have called _ chaotic size dependence _ @xcite .",
    "we noted in sec .",
    "[ subsec : pure ] that a thermodynamic state , pure or mixed , can be constructed as the infinite - volume limit of a sequence of finite - volume gibbs distributions . in the curie - weiss model , and again ignoring various technical complications in definitions of pure states , one can study the effects of adding a spin to an @xmath22-spin system , which simultaneously requires the introduction of @xmath22 new couplings .",
    "( in spin glasses , this approach has been termed the `` cavity method '' @xcite . )",
    "it is clear that addition of a single spin will not substantially alter a fixed correlation function , whether single- or multi - spin .",
    "one can therefore sensibly conceive of a limiting thermodynamic state ( in this case a mixture of positive and negative uniformly magnetized states , each with probability @xmath87 ) .    in the sk model , though , the situation is radically different . as @xmath59 ,",
    "any specified correlation function should not depend on any finite set of couplings , because the overall magnitude of any such finite set scales to zero and each of the new couplings accompanying each additional spin is chosen independently of the previous ones .",
    "what this suggests is that ( below @xmath64 ) any specified correlation function will not settle down to a limit as @xmath59 ; equivalently , the cavity method does not result in a limiting thermodynamic state .",
    "this heuristic argument introduces us to the pervasive presence of _ chaotic size dependence _ in spin glasses . for recent results on this issue ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "if such a straightforward procedure does not result in a thermodynamic state , then does the notion of many pure states in the sk model make sense ?",
    "in one way , at least , the answer is yes , even though the meaning of an individual pure state is still imprecise . in an operational sense , one could in principle keep a record of the values of a finite set of even correlation functions ( with , say , free boundary conditions ) as @xmath22 grows ( at fixed @xmath26 ) .",
    "if these values approach a limit , one can with some justification describe the low - temperature phase as consisting of a single pair of states ( because each finite - spin state would simply be an equal mixture of the two ) . if , however , the correlation functions persist in changing their values as @xmath22 grows , then one can infer that there must exist many such pairs  presumably infinitely many , if there is no repetitive pattern .",
    "now it is true , by compactness arguments , that in the latter case there must exist ( infinitely many ) subsequences that result in distinct limiting states .",
    "but it is also almost certainly true that there is no _ measurable _ way of doing this ; i.e. , no procedure for selecting subsequences that is independent of a specific coupling realization @xmath91 .",
    "the consequence is that there is _ no finite procedure _ for selecting convergent subsequences , and therefore generating thermodynamic states .",
    "however , while generating individual states seems to be problematic , it is nonetheless possible to devise simple procedures for measuring _ statistical _ properties of such states .",
    "so the focus should not be on individual states , as in the conventional statistical mechanics of ordered systems , but instead on some larger construct that measures such statistical properties",
    ". this will be further discussed in sec .",

    "@xmath124    here chaotic size dependence seems to follow from the scaling of the coupling magnitudes to zero as @xmath59 , with the result that no local state properties depend on a finite set of couplings .",
    "while this is part of the story ( and in fact , an important part ) , it is not the entire story . in short - ranged models like the ea spin glass ,",
    "coupling magnitudes are fixed independently of volume , but as we shall see in the next section , chaotic size dependence is present there also , although certain differences now appear between the infinite- and finite - ranged models .",
    "we already noted in the previous section that one important difference between the ea and the sk models is that coupling magnitudes scale to zero in the latter but not the former . while this is also true in infinite - ranged models in homogeneous systems , the _ randomness _ in the couplings in the disordered case results in significant differences between short - ranged and infinite - ranged models .",
    "as before , consider a volume @xmath7 in the ea model .",
    "boundary conditions , such as free , periodic , antiperiodic , or fixed , now need to be specified .",
    "( in some rough sense , one can think of the sk model as having free `` boundary '' conditions . )",
    "recall that in the homogeneous ising ferromagnet below @xmath64 , different pure states can be generated by using sequences of plus _ vs. _  minus boundary conditions .",
    "so one test of multiple states is the _ sensitivity _ of correlation functions , deep in the interior , upon change of boundary conditions far away .    if there is only a single pure state ( e.g. , a paramagnet ) , then any sequence of boundary conditions results in that single limiting state , and there is no chaotic size dependence .",
    "if broken spin - flip symmetry exists , i.e. , there is a phase with @xmath31 , then there must be different sequences of boundary conditions leading to different limiting states . but how can we use this fact to determine whether there is only a single pair of pure states , as in the droplet / scaling picture , or infinitely many pairs , as would be required , for example , by an rsb - like picture ?    we start by defining an _ observable _ state .",
    "we do not expect observable physical properties to depend on the microscopic details of the couplings , but instead on macroscopic properties .",
    "for example , in a dilute magnetic alloy , one needs to study the system without knowing the microscopic locations of all the magnetic impurity atoms . as a consequence , measurements on a spin glass are necessarily made in a manner independent of the microscopic coupling realization corresponding to that particular sample .",
    "this suggests that physical properties should be associated with states that are mathematically constructed in a _ coupling - independent _ manner ; in particular , by using boundary conditions that do not depend on the couplings @xcite .",
    "we are therefore led to the following :    * working definition : * an _ observable state _ is a thermodynamic state , pure or mixed , whose existence is manifested through some sequence of coupling-_independent _ boundary conditions .",
    "this working definition is not mathematically precise , but will be made so in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : physobserv ] .",
    "the definition suggests the possible existence of other , `` invisible '' , states ; these will be briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : invisible ] .    clearly , the many states appearing in the parisi solution of the sk model are observable . but",
    "this then leads to another question : instead of bothering with boundary conditions , why not use the overlap measure @xmath84 to detect many states in the ea model , just as it was successfully used in the sk model ? as we will see in sec .",
    "[ subsec : problem ] , @xmath84 turns out in general to be an unreliable indicator of the existence of many states in short - ranged models ( whether homogeneous or disordered ) ; it can give the appearance of many states where there is only a single pair , and the appearance of only a single pair  indeed , sometimes even only a single state  when there are infinitely many .",
    "so how can one distinguish between the presence of infinitely many pure states _ vs. _",
    "only a single pair for the ea model ? in the next two subsections , we will show that the answer lies in studying _ spin - flip symmetric _ boundary conditions .",
    "the definition of observable states given in the previous section still seems somewhat impractical , or at least not `` finite '' , since it involves the existence of infinite - volume limits .",
    "however , its consequences are indeed practical _ and _ finite , in particular for numerical experiments .",
    "for example , one implication is that the presence of multiple obervable states manifests itself as a sensitivity of correlation functions deep in the interior of a finite volume @xmath7 to changes in the boundary conditions on @xmath125 .    in order to make this idea precise ,",
    "consider a fixed volume @xmath126 within which correlation functions are studied , centered inside a much larger volume @xmath7 .",
    "we will call @xmath126 a `` window '' @xcite .",
    "suppose now that there exists only a single pure state at some temperature @xmath26 ; for sufficiently high @xmath26 in either the ea or sk models , this would be the paramagnet .",
    "as noted in the previous section , any infinite sequence of boundary conditions will result in this single limiting pure state .",
    "( in the above sentence , and throughout the paper , `` infinite sequence of boundary conditions '' is shorthand for an infinite sequence of finite - volume gibbs states , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finite ] ) , generated by a sequence of volumes with the specified boundary conditions . ) as a consequence , if one looks at a fixed window @xmath126 inside a much larger volume @xmath7 , any change in the boundary conditions on @xmath125 will leave the correlation functions inside the window largely unaffected ( with any small effects vanishing as the boundaries recede to infinity . )    suppose now that there are two pure states , say the positive and negative magnetization states in the ising ferromagnet .",
    "if one switches from the fixed boundary condition on @xmath125 with all boundary spins @xmath38 , to the fixed boundary condition with all boundary spins @xmath127 , correlation functions _ everywhere _ inside the volume will change ( corresponding to a change from the positively magnetized to the negatively magnetized state ) , no matter how large @xmath8 becomes .",
    "so the presence of multiple gibbs states results in sensitivity to boundary conditions .",
    "demonstration of such sensitivity in spin glasses at sufficiently low but nonzero temperature in a given dimension would already be sufficient to answer open question 1 .",
    "more is needed , however , if one wants to address the issue of whether there is a single pair of pure states or infinitely many .      as noted in sec .",
    "[ subsec : overlaps ] , an infinite sequence of periodic boundary conditions in the ( uniform or random ) ising ferromagnet , above the lower critical dimension and below @xmath64 , does lead to a limiting mixed state @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the positively magnetized and @xmath130 the negatively magnetized state .",
    "if these are the _ only _ pure states , then any sequence of antiperiodic boundary conditions will also have a limit and yield the _ same _ mixed state .",
    "of course , there will be a relative domain wall between periodic and antiperiodic b.c .",

    "if there is only a single pair of pure states @xmath54 and @xmath132 that transform into each other under a global spin flip ( as in the droplet / scaling picture ) , then any sequence of symmetric boundary conditions has a limiting thermodynamic state @xcite , which is simply the mixed state @xmath133 .",
    "as a consequence , switching from periodic to antiperiodic b.c.s in a large volume leaves the gibbs state unaffected inside a window deep in the interior .",
    "what happens if there are many pure state pairs , as would be the case in a mean - field - like picture ? in this case , two arbitrarily chosen pure states ( not from the same pair ) would have relative domain walls that do _ not _ deflect to infinity .",
    "if the free energy cost of such domain walls does not exceed the free energy difference in a typical @xmath7 incurred by switching from , say , periodic to antiperiodic boundary conditions , then these different pairs of states should be observable under such a switch .",
    "in other words , if many pure state pairs exist , and their relative free energy differences are not too large , then switching from periodic to antiperiodic b.c.s in a typical @xmath7 should change the gibbs state deep in the interior .",
    "how large is `` not too large '' ?",
    "a trivial upper bound is a domain wall whose free energy scales as @xmath134 or smaller , since a switch in boundary conditions obviously can not result in a greater free energy change .",
    "but in the ea model , a much better bound can be found rigorously . at fixed temperature ,",
    "if one switches from periodic to antiperiodic b.c.s then in @xmath7 , the root mean square free energy difference is bounded from above by @xmath135 , i.e. , the square root of the surface area @xcite .",

    "the proof , given in @xcite , is relatively straightforward , and uses two ingredients .",
    "the first is that , as proved in @xcite , along some deterministic subsequence of volumes both the histogram construction of metastates and the aizenman - wehr construction @xcite result in the same metastate .",
    "but because the latter method averages over couplings outside of each volume , it rigorously follows ( exactly as in the proof of theorem  2 in sec .  [ subsubsec : manystates ] ) that two metastates constructed with flip - related b.c.s must be the same .    despite the straightforward nature of the theorem and proof , it is a striking result , and its consequences for the nature of the spin glass state are immediate .",
    "not only are the periodic and antiperiodic metastates the same ; if one were to choose , in a @xmath17-independent manner , two _ arbitrary _ sequences of periodic and antiperiodic b.c.s , the metastates ( with probability one ) would _ still _ be identical .",
    "that is , the metastate , and corresponding overlap distributions constructed from it , at any fixed temperature and in any dimension are highly _ insensitive _ to boundary conditions .",
    "this invariance with respect to different sequences of periodic and antiperiodic b.c.s means that the frequency of appearance of various thermodynamic states @xmath238 in finite volumes @xmath7 is ( with probability one ) _",
    "independent _ of the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , this same invariance property holds ( with probability one ) among any two sequences of _ fixed _ boundary conditions ( and the fixed boundary condition of choice may even be allowed to vary arbitrarily along any single sequence of volumes ) !",
    "it follows that , with respect to changes of boundary conditions , the metastate is extraordinarily robust",
    ".    this insensitivity would be unsurprising if there were only a single thermodynamic state , such as paramagnetic , or a single pair of flip - related states , as in droplet / scaling .",
    "but it is difficult to see how our result can be reconciled with the presence of _ many _ thermodynamic states ; indeed , at first glance it would appear to rule them out .",
    "however , while it does not rule out the possibility of many states , theorem  3 does put severe constraints on the form of the metastate and its overlap distribution function . in light of this strong invariance property ,",
    "any metastate constructed via coupling - independent b.cs should be able to support only a very simple overlap structure , effectively ruling out the nonstandard sk picture .",
    "the nonstandard sk picture requires ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) ) that the @xmath162 s appearing in the metastate be of the form @xmath239 , with the weights @xmath240 in each @xmath162 nonzero and unequal .",
    "that implies that with periodic b.c.s , say , the fraction of @xmath241 s for which the finite volume gibbs state in @xmath224 puts ( e.g. ) at least 84% of its weight in one pair of pure states is , say , 0.39 .",
    "but then it must also be the case that with antiperiodic b.c.s the fraction of volumes for which the finite volume gibbs state puts at least 84% of its weight in some unspecified pair is still exactly 0.39 !",
    "moreover , the same argument must apply to any `` cut '' one might care to make ; i.e. , one constructs the periodic b.c .",

    "then this must be true also for all volumes with antiperiodic b.cs ; and similarly ( but possibly separately ) among all pairs of fixed b.c .",
    "states .",
    "the only sensible way in which this could happen would be for the selection of states to be insensitive to the choice of boundary conditions , i.e. , a particular sequence of b.c.s should not prefer any states over any others , so that @xmath88 , the average over the metastate , would be some sort of uniform mixture of the pure states .",
    "however , this _ can not _ happen when the @xmath162 s are nontrivial mixed states , as in eq .",

    "this leads to a contradiction , ruling out not only nonstandard sk but _ any picture _ in which the @xmath162 s are a nontrivial mixture of pure states .",
    "when combined with our previous elimination of more standard versions of the mean field picture , it removes the possibility of _ any _ version of mean field ordering in short - ranged spin glasses .",
    "the invariance property of the metastate requires that both the pure state structure and the overlap structure of realistic spin glasses should be relatively simple .",
    "so what are the remaining , plausible possibilities for the structure of the spin glass phase ? in the next section , we will introduce a new picture , guided once again by metastate concepts .",
    "assuming that spin - flip symmetry is broken below some @xmath250 , with @xmath12 greater than some lower critical dimension @xmath28 , what then are the possible structures that the spin glass phase can assume ?",
    "a two - state picture , in which the only observable pure states are global flips of each other , remains completely consistent with all rigorous results described in the preceding section . as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : open ] , the droplet / scaling scenario is such a two - state picture . at the same time , it should be emphasized that droplet / scaling makes additional assumptions that our results do not address .",
    "if it were to be proved that there exists only a single pair of pure states in the spin glass phase in any finite dimension above @xmath28 , this would lend strong support to droplet / scaling , but such a proof alone would not be sufficient to demonstrate its correctness . for fuller discussions of droplet / scaling , see @xcite .",
    "are there any many - state pictures that _ are _ consistent with the strong constraints imposed by the invariance of the metastate ?",
    "there is such a picture , introduced by the authors in @xcite , and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "it is called the _ chaotic pairs _ picture , for reasons that will become apparent below .    in a simple two - state picture like",
    "droplet / scaling , the overlap distribution function @xmath251 in a volume @xmath7 will simply approximate a sum of two @xmath85-functions , as in fig .  4 , but with @xmath252 replaced by @xmath92 . in the chaotic pairs picture , each finite - volume gibbs state @xmath253 will still be approximately a mixture of a _ single _ pair of spin - flip - related pure states , _ but now the pure state pair will vary chaotically with @xmath8 . _",
    "then for each @xmath7 , @xmath251 will again approximate a sum of two @xmath85-functions at @xmath92 .",
    "this picture is fully consistent with metastate invariance .",

    ", one finds that @xmath256 here , the pure state pair ( of the infinitely many present ) appearing in finite volume @xmath7 depends chaotically on @xmath8 . unlike the droplet / scaling picture , this new possibility exhibits csd with periodic b.c.s .",
    "so , like nonstandard sk , the periodic b.c .  metastate is dispersed over ( infinitely ) many @xmath162 s , but unlike nonstandard sk each @xmath162 is a _",

    "the overlap distribution for each @xmath162 is the same : @xmath258 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the highly disordered spin glass model @xcite , mentioned in sec .",
    "[ subsec : frustration ] , appears to display just this behavior in its ground state structure in sufficiently high dimension .",
    "why does nt an argument similar to that used to rule out nonstandard sk also rule out chaotic pairs ?",
    "because in the chaotic pairs picture , as in droplet / scaling , there are in each @xmath162 only two pure states ( depending on @xmath162 in chaotic pairs ) , each with weight @xmath87 .",
    "all even correlations are the same in any pair of flip - related pure states , so , by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : walpha ] ) and ( [ eq : ralpha ] ) , any change in couplings leaves the weights unchanged .",
    "there is an interesting additional piece of information that metastate invariance supplies for many - state pictures like chaotic pairs : the number of pure state pairs ( if infinite ) must be an _",
    "uncountable _ infinity .",
    "if there were a _",

    "metastate , then it would be more appropriate to refer to this picture as `` chaotic pure states '' , because the gibbs state in a typical large volume @xmath7 with fixed b.c.s will be ( approximately ) a single pure state that varies chaotically with @xmath8 .",
    "but the thermodynamic picture is the same , and just manifests itself slightly differently in different metastates . in particular , the _ average _ over the metastate @xmath88 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : rhoav ] ) ) should be the same for periodic and fixed b.c.s .",
    "we conclude with a brief note about zero temperature , where we observed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : differences ] that in each @xmath7 there is only a single ground state pair . if droplet / scaling holds , then this pair is the same for all large @xmath8 ; if infinitely many ground state pairs exist , then the pair changes chaotically with @xmath8",

    "the metastates , hence overlap functions , of these many - state pictures differ only at positive temperature : the mean - field rsb picture at @xmath259 consists of the @xmath162 in each volume exhibiting a nontrivial mixture of pure state pairs as in eq .",

    "_ so using @xmath96 in the usual way can not differentiate between a many - state picture like chaotic pairs and a two - state picture like droplet / scaling_.    one could try an alternative approach , such as looking at the average state over many volumes , as an approximation to studying the average over the metastate @xmath218 .",
    "this average looks very different in the two pictures : in droplet / scaling , it is still a trivial mixture of two states , of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : possfive ] ) , while in chaotic pairs , it is presumably a uniform mixture over uncountably many states .",
    "this approach , in effect , takes the thermodynamic limit _ before _ breaking the replica symmetry , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : nonstandard ] .    now there _ will _ be a difference between overlap functions in droplet / scaling and chaotic pairs .",

    "but , although there is now a difference between overlap functions in droplet / scaling and chaotic pairs , there is now also _ no _ difference between overlap functions in chaotic pairs and in the simple paramagnet !",
    "so , although the form of the overlap function can depend on how its computation is done , _ the overlap structure in spin glasses must be simple _ , regardless of whether there are infinitely many pure states or only a single pair .",
    "moreover , the overlap function can not distinguish between many states , and one or two states , in an unambiguous manner .",
    "similar problems with overlap functions , in particular their sensitivity to boundary conditions for short - ranged systems , are discussed in @xcite .",
    "there it is noted that in the three - dimensional random field ising model at low temperature and weak field magnitude , @xmath265 computed in a given @xmath7 will miss one of the relevant pure states .",
    "conversely , in the two - dimensional ising ferromagnet on a square lattice , at low temperature , and with antiperiodic b.c.s in both directions , @xmath265 gives the appearance of many states where there are only two .",

    "our discussion up to now has focused largely on the numbers and organization of pure states in the spin glass phase , if it exists .",
    "even though these are fundamental constructs from the point of view of thermodynamics , and their multiplicity and organization directly affect observable equilibrium @xcite and dynamical @xcite spin glass properties , they may still seem somewhat abstract . in this section",
    "we will draw on recent results that provide a concrete link between the structure of interfaces on the one hand , and numbers of pure states , the relationships among them , and their low - lying excited states on the other . at the same time , we will extend and clarify our earlier distinction ( sec .",

    "so the interface between two configurations is the union of all domain walls , and may consist of one or many .",
    "we usually envision domain walls as lines or surfaces in the _ dual _ lattice , cutting those bonds satisfied in one but not the other spin configuration .",
    "domain walls therefore separate regions ( in the real lattice ) in which spins in @xmath266 and @xmath267 agree from regions where they disagree .",
    "we will confine our remarks here to zero temperature , although it is possible to extend the discussion to nonzero temperatures .",
    "we are interested only in interfaces whose linear spatial extent @xmath268 is @xmath269 in @xmath7 . at zero temperature , these are the _ only _ interfaces between ground state configurations , if the coupling distribution is continuous ; that this is so follows from the same argument proving that domain walls separating infinite spin configurations can not end in any finite region and can not have closed loops @xcite .",
    "however , the restriction against closed loops need not apply to interfaces separating ground and excited states .",

    "one of the interesting features of spin glasses is the possibility of ground or pure states separated by space - filling interfaces , unlike in ferromagnets where @xmath273 always .",
    "for example , the interface ground states generated from dobrushin boundary conditions ( all boundary spins on one side of a plane bisecting @xmath7 fixed at @xmath38 and the remaining boundary spins @xmath127 ) have a single domain wall relative to the uniform ground states , with @xmath274 .",
    "the first result of this section is a theorem first proved in @xcite indicating that interfaces separating _ observable _ ground states are space - filling .",

    "our emphasis in this review has been on observable pure states , which we have identified as the ` physical ' states ; that is , we expect only those states to influence outcomes of laboratory measurements or numerical simulations .",
    "still , it may be interesting to consider also the characteristics of ` invisible ' states , should they be present .",
    "recall that an invisible pure state is one that does not lie in the support of any coupling - independent metastate .",
    "invisible pure states can only be generated by sequences of coupling- _ dependent _ boundary conditions .",
    "there is presently no known method for constructing such states , and it is not clear whether such constructions , if found , would be measurable ( sec .  [ sec : csd ] ) .",

    "nevertheless , if they should be found to exist , one can still make some predictions about their properties .    from the discussion in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : free ] , the interfaces between invisible states would necessarily have energies scaling as @xmath277 , with @xmath278 ; any interface with lower energy would almost certainly show up in a coupling - independent metastate .",

    "such an interface would necessarily have high energy ; if its energy exponent @xmath279 , it would not correspond to an interface between invisible and observable pure states , but rather to one between excited and ground states .",

    "the unifying concept is that of the _ metastate _ ( sec .",

    "universal themes that clarify the study of disordered systems can be considered : the detectability of many states , chaotic size dependence , the relations between interface types and pure states , ` windows ' in numerical experiments , and others .    as noted ,",
    "a prominent application of these methods leads to the conclusion that the spin glass differs from most other statistical mechanical systems in that its infinite - ranged version displays unique low - temperature properties , not shared by corresponding short - ranged models in any dimension and at any temperature ( for other differences between homogeneous and disordered systems in general , see sec .",
    "[ subsec : statmech ] ) .",
    "a likely underlying cause of this difference is the combination of the following features in the infinite - ranged spin glass : the presence of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings , the statistical independence of all of the couplings , and the scaling of their magnitudes to zero as @xmath59 ( cf .",

    "we begin by clarifying some essential issues .",
    "although the contents of the following two subsections can be placed naturally into sections  [ subsec : pure ] and [ subsec : standard ] , respectively , the issues they treat have generated sufficient confusion that it seems worthwhile to address them separately .",

    "a careful discussion has been given in @xcite , to which we refer the reader .",
    "we note that the definition of pure states given in sec .",
    "[ subsec : pure ] does in fact correspond , at least on a heuristic level , to the intuitive notion of ` valley ' as a collection of configurations separated from all other configurations by barriers that diverge in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this last statement can be made more precise , as in @xcite , by considering a specific dynamics ; in our case , the dynamics could be the lattice animal @xmath263-spin - flip dynamics discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : method ] , for any finite @xmath263 .",
    "then a pure state may be thought of as a collection of configurations that can be reached from each other via the dynamics in finite time . at a given dimension and temperature",
    ", there may be only a single pure state or multiple , disjoint pure states .    for an @xmath22-spin system , with @xmath22 finite ,",
    "it is often useful to think of spin configurations as belonging to different ` pure states ' if the dynamical pathway ( here it is necessary that @xmath293 ) connecting them requires a time that scales as the exponent of @xmath22 to some power ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this notion has been highly successful in constructing dynamics - based solutions to the sk model @xcite .",
    "there are two natural objections that are sometimes raised to the conclusion of @xcite , in which the standard sk picture is ruled out ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the specific overlap distributions constructed in @xcite and described above involve certain types of averaging , for example , over lengthscale for fixed @xmath17 .",
    "are these in fact different from the @xmath84 described by rsb theory , or studied in numerical experiments ?",
    "moreover , might it not be that the averaging process used in @xcite is itself the cause of the self - averaged nature of the resultant @xmath84 ?",
    "the answer to these objections appears in @xcite .",
    "the first point is that , because of chaotic size dependence , the presence of many states probably forbids the construction of any ( infinite - volume ) @xmath84 with the following two properties : ( i ) the construction can be defined for a.e .",
    "@xmath17 ( necessary if _ any _ sort of averaging over coupling realizations is to make sense ) , and ( ii ) the construction entails no averaging of any kind .",
    "so , for example , the construction proposed in @xcite , where @xmath84 is first defined for finite @xmath8 , followed by taking a straightforward @xmath46 limit , can not work  there is no limiting @xmath84 for this construction ( if there are many states ) .",
    "however , even if there were a construction with the above two properties , the conclusion would be unchanged , because _ how @xmath84 is constructed is irrelevant _  there can not exist any @xmath84 which is both a physical infinite volume object _ and _ which is non - self - averaging .",
    "in fact , the only way out would be to construct a clearly unphysical @xmath84 that depends on the choice of origin of the coordinate system .",
    "this is an immediate ( and rigorous ) consequence of the spatial ergodicity of the underlying disorder distribution , as explained in @xcite .",
    "our conclusions regarding the disconnect between the sk and ea models are supported by rigorous results .",
    "nevertheless , there have been numerous studies that claim to support the basic features of the replica symmetry breaking , mean - field pure state structure in ea models in finite dimensions . in this section",
    "we discuss some of these studies and examine how they can be reconciled with the theorems reviewed above . given the large number of such studies , we confine ourselves to a small but representative sample .",
    "for conciseness sake , we will not review studies that claim to support pictures that are consistent with our results @xcite , such as droplet / scaling .",
    "( we emphasize once again , however , that our results make no claim about the correctness of droplet / scaling , and are equally compatible with some other competing pictures . )",
    "there have been numerous simulations of the ea model , mostly in three and four dimensions , that claim to find results consistent with the rsb picture .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to those studies that examine equilibrium properties .",

    "a further problem concerns the temperature at which many of these studies is carried out . as discussed in sec .  5 of @xcite , thermal effects can contribute heavily to nontrivial structure in either spin or edge overlaps , and can therefore also lead to misleading conclusions .",
    "some suggestions for overcoming these problems were presented in @xcite .    given all of these issues , it is unclear exactly what is actually being measured in these simulations , and extreme caution needs to be exercised before any conclusions addressing the relevance of rsb to short - ranged systems can be drawn from these studies .",

    "it should first be noted , though , that the calculations , though extensive , involve a number of uncontrolled approximations that need to be understood before any conclusions can be reached .",

    "one well - known example arose from studies @xcite of migdal - kadanoff renormalization - group transformations on frustrated ising systems on hierarchical lattices . in these studies ,",
    "chaotic renormalization - group trajectories were observed , possibly suggesting a type of spin glass - like behavior .",
    "the specific behavior uncovered was a chaotic sequence of alternating strong and weak spin - spin correlations as distance increased .",
    "we suspect that the this behavior , if it carries over to spin glasses on euclidean lattices , arises from different physical origins than those giving rise to chaotic size dependence .",
    "roughly speaking , the renormalization - group studies of @xcite uncover how correlation strengths change as one looks at spins increasingly farther apart .",
    "in contrast , chaotic size dependence focuses on a _ fixed _ correlation function , for example @xmath298 , calculated for each @xmath7 using an ordinary gibbs measure with , say , periodic boundary conditions . if @xmath298 changes chaotically as @xmath8 grows , a clear signal for many pure states is provided .",
    "if it does not , then the system likely has no more than a single pair of pure states .",
    "we re not aware of any studies attempting to correlate the presence of many states with changes in @xmath299 as @xmath300 increases , as in @xcite , but we suspect that such chaoticity may be present _",

    "the issue remains unresolved .",
    "chaotic temperature dependence and chaotic size dependence are clearly different , given that the latter is seen at _ fixed _ temperature .",
    "nevertheless , the intriguing question arises : are the two somehow related ?",
    "we do not know the answer at this time .",
    "it seems at least plausible that a chaotic change in a fixed correlation function as the volume increases ( csd ) would imply a similar chaoticity as temperature changes ( ctd ) , given that the former corresponds to surface changes and the latter to bulk changes . on the other hand ,",
    "chaotic size dependence only occurs ( for , say , periodic boundary conditions ) when there exist many competing pure states , and is absent for a single pair , as in droplet / scaling .",
    "at the same time , the droplet / scaling picture seems to require chaotic temperature dependence , which arises there from a lack of ` rigidity ' ( compared to a ferromagnet ) in the spin glass phase .",
    "so at the very least , chaotic temperature dependence does not seem to imply chaotic size dependence .",
    "whether the converse is true remains an open question .      in sec .",
    "[ subsec : sk ] the stability analysis of dealmeida and thouless @xcite was discussed .",
    "although the original intent was to study the stability of the replica - symmetric sk solution @xcite in the @xmath26-@xmath14 plane , the consequences of the analysis of @xcite remain important for short - ranged models as well . in particular , the phase separation boundary between the paramagnetic and spin glass phases in the @xmath26-@xmath14 plane is now generically referred to as an `` at '' line , and debate over its existence for realistic spin glasses remains strong . in the rsb picture , the at line begins at @xmath301 and extends upward through nonzero values of @xmath14 ( see , for example , fig .",
    "48 of @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the droplet / scaling model predicts that the spin glass phase is unstable to _ any _ external magnetic field , no matter so small , resulting in no at line .",
    "however , in the droplet / scaling picture even a small magnetic field will have dramatic dynamical consequences .",
    "the droplet theory predicts a `` magnetic correlation length '' @xmath302 that diverges as an inverse power of the field as @xmath303 ( the power itself being a function of the domain wall energy exponent @xmath304 defined in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : free ] ) .",
    "the magnetic correlation length describes roughly the lengthscale over which a field @xmath14 will destroy local correlations in a spin glass phase . on this lengthscale",
    ", the characteristic relaxation time @xmath305 grows exponentially with @xmath302 @xcite .",
    "consequently , spin glass correlations can persist for unmeasurably long times in small fields .",
    "this makes it difficult to establish for a real spin glass sample whether a true thermodynamic at line exists or whether one is instead observing a nonequilibrium dynamical effect . in the droplet /",
    "scaling picture , one therefore replaces the equilibrium at line with a dynamical one , separating regions in the @xmath26-@xmath14 plane where the system falls out of equilibrium on accessible laboratory time scales ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "this feature , however , can create difficulties in the interpretation not only of laboratory experiments but also of numerical simulations ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we turn now to our own results .",
    "we point out first that all of our theorems regarding self - averaging of overlaps , and therefore lack of viability of the rsb picture in short - ranged models , are not affected by addition of a magnetic field .",
    "however , our results do _ not _ rule out the presence of a true , thermodynamic at line .",
    "in particular , the many - state chaotic pairs picture remains perfectly consistent with the presence of such a line .",
    "whether an at line ultimately exists will almost certainly depend on the resolution of the problem of the number of states in _ zero _ external field : in all likelihood , there is no line if only a single pair of pure states exists , but it should be present if many states exist .",
    "our analysis has focused largely on pure state structure and ordering in short - ranged spin glass models .",
    "while our emphasis has centered on equilibrium thermodynamics , we have argued elsewhere @xcite that pure states also deeply influence nonequilibrium dynamical phenomena , such as coarsening , aging , and others related to dynamical evolution following a deep quench .",
    "another prominent , and much studied , feature of spin glasses is the presence of many _",
    "metastable _ states , i.e. , states that are energetically stable up to @xmath263-spin flips for some finite @xmath263 , but unstable to flips of clusters of more than @xmath263 spins . colloquially speaking , these are spin configurations that are ` local ' rather than ` global ' energy ( or free energy , at positive temperature ) minima ; their confining barriers are of height @xmath71 rather than @xmath306 for some @xmath307 .",
    "these states are believed to be responsible for much of the anomalously slow relaxation features of spin glasses @xcite , and their presence has led to new numerical techniques such as simulated annealing @xcite .    in @xcite , we studied the properties of metastable states not only in ea spin glasses with continuous coupling distributions such as gaussian , but also disordered ferromagnets .",
    "we will confine ourselves here to spin glasses , and will only present our own results ; the reader is referred to @xcite for a more detailed discussion , as well as references to other work on metastability .    to clarify the discussion ,",
    "we define a 1-spin - flip stable state as an infinite - volume spin configuration whose energy , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ea ] ) , can not be lowered by the flip of any single spin .",
    "similarly , an @xmath263-spin - flip stable state ( @xmath308 ) is an infinite - volume spin configuration whose energy can not be lowered by the flip of any cluster of @xmath309 spins .",
    "recall ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : pure ] ) that a _ ground _",
    "state is an infinite - volume spin configuration whose energy can not be lowered by the flip of _ any _ finite cluster of spins ( i.e. , @xmath310 ) .",
    "our approach to studying metastable states is rather unusual , and based on a new dynamical technique : we construct a natural ensemble ( the `` @xmath263-stable ensemble '' ) on states that evolve from an initial spin configuration generated through a deep quench via a zero - temperature `` lattice animal '' dynamics .",
    "we briefly describe this method , starting with the single - spin - flip case .",
    "let @xmath311 denote the initial ( time zero ) infinite - volume spin configuration on @xmath312 .",
    "it is chosen from the infinite - temperature ensemble in which each spin is equally likely to be @xmath38 or @xmath127 , independently of the others .",
    "the continuous - time dynamics is given by independent , rate-1 poisson processes at each site @xmath2 corresponding to those times @xmath122 at which the spin at @xmath2 looks at its neighbors and determines whether to flip .",
    "it does so only if a flip lowers the system energy ( that is , we consider only zero - temperature dynamics ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath313 a given realization of this zero - temperature single - spin flip dynamics ; so a given realization @xmath313 would then consist of a collection of random times @xmath314 ( @xmath315 , @xmath316 ) at every @xmath2 when spin flips for the spin @xmath6 are considered .",
    "given the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ea ] ) and a specific @xmath17 , @xmath311 , and @xmath313 , a system will evolve towards a single well - defined spin configuration @xmath317 at time @xmath122 ( this uses the fact that the individual couplings come from a continuous distribution such as gaussian ) .",
    "it is important to note that these three realizations ( coupling , initial spin configuration , and dynamics ) are chosen independently of one another .",
    "the continuous coupling distribution and zero - temperature dynamics together guarantee that the energy per spin @xmath318 is always a monotonically decreasing function of time .",
    "we now consider _",
    "multiple_-spin flips , in which we allow rigid flips of all lattice animals ( i.e. , finite connected subsets of @xmath312 , not necessarily containing the origin ) up to size @xmath263 .",
    "the case @xmath319 is the single - spin flip case just described ; @xmath320 corresponds to the case where both single - spin flips and rigid flips of all nearest - neighbor pairs of spins are allowed ; and the case of general @xmath263 corresponds to flips of 1-spin , 2-spin , 3-spin , @xmath200 @xmath263-spin connected clusters .",
    "a specific realization of this @xmath263-spin - flip dynamics will be denoted @xmath321 .",
    "there is a technical issue that needs to be addressed , because we wish the dynamics to remain sensible even in the limit @xmath310 .",
    "we require that the probability that any fixed spin considers a flip in a unit time interval remains of order one , uniformly in @xmath263 .",
    "such a choice would guarantee , for example , that the probability that a spin considers a flip in a time interval @xmath322 vanishes as @xmath323 , again uniformly in @xmath263 . a further requirement for the dynamics to be well - defined",
    "is that information not propagate arbitrarily fast throughout the lattice as @xmath263 becomes arbitrarily large .",
    "it is not difficult to construct such a dynamics , but we omit the technical details here ; they can be found in @xcite .      in this section",
    "we present some of the results found in @xcite ; we omit all proofs and detailed discussions .",
    "some of these results are expected , while others are surprising and at variance with the `` folk wisdom '' that has evolved over the years . aside from the intrinsic interest in the structure of metastability in spin glasses",
    ", we believe that the information obtained also sheds light on some aspects of pure state structure , if only by way of contrast .",
    "all results given below are rigorous , and hold for a.e .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath311 , and @xmath321 .",
    "* existence and number of metastable states . *",
    " in an infinite system , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ea ] ) displays _ uncountably _ many @xmath263-spin - flip stable states , for all finite @xmath324 and for all finite @xmath325 .    *",
    "convergence of dynamics following a deep quench*.  it is not obvious _ a priori _ whether the system evolves towards a single , final metastable state @xmath326 . it can be proved , however , that such a final state exists almost surely .",
    "equivalently , every spin flips only finitely many times .",
    "( this is in contrast to , say , the @xmath327 ising ferromagnet , where every spin flips _ infinitely _ many times @xcite . )    * how much information is contained in the initial state ? *  for @xmath319 in @xmath328 , precisely half the spins in @xmath326 are completely determined by @xmath311 , with the other half completely undetermined by @xmath311 . for higher @xmath12 and the same dynamics , it can be shown that a dynamical order parameter @xmath329 , measuring the percentage dependence of @xmath326 on @xmath311 , is strictly between 0 and 1 .",
    "* size of basins of attraction *  the basins of attraction of the individual metastable states are of negligible size , in the following sense : almost every @xmath311 is on a boundary between two or more metastable states .",
    "equivalently , the union of the domains of attraction of _ all _ of the metastable states forms a set of measure zero , in the space of all @xmath311 s .",
    "( a similar result for pure states was proved in @xcite . )",
    "* distribution of energy densities . *",
    " for any @xmath263 , almost every @xmath263-spin - flip stable state has the same energy density , @xmath330 .",
    "moreover , the dynamics can be chosen so that @xmath331 , and furthermore @xmath330 for any finite @xmath263 is larger than the ground state energy density , which is the limit of @xmath330 as @xmath332 .",
    "* overlaps . *",
    " almost every pair of metastable states , whether two @xmath263-spin - flip stable states or one @xmath263- and one @xmath333-spin - flip stable state , has zero spin overlap .",
    "so the overlap distribution function , for either _ all _ of the metastable states , or only all those with any fixed @xmath263 , is simply a @xmath85-function at zero .    *",
    "scaling of number of metastable states with volume . *",
    " for sufficiently large volumes , the number of metastable states in finite samples scales exponentially with the volume in general @xmath12 for states of any stability .",
    "* remanent magnetization . *",
    " if the initial state is uniformly @xmath38 in @xmath328 , the remanent magnetization is known to be @xmath334 ( for @xmath319)@xcite . in higher dimensions , a heuristic calculation for the gaussian spin glass",
    "gives a rigorous lower bound on the remanent magnetization that for large @xmath12 behaves like @xmath335 .",
    "exact results can be obtained in all @xmath12 for some other models @xcite .",
    "* correspondence between pure and metastable states . *",
    " more precisely , if there are multiple pure or ground state pairs , does the spin configuration corresponding to a typical metastable state `` live in '' the domain of attraction of a single pure or ground state , as is commonly thought ?",
    "the answer is _ no _ in both cases : almost every metastable state will be on a boundary in configuration space between multiple pure or ground states .",
    "finally , we ask : does knowledge of metastable states provide information on the number or structure of thermodynamic ground or pure states ?",
    "so far , the answer seems to be largely no .",
    "for example , in the one - dimensional spin glass there is only a single pair of thermodynamic ground states , but an uncountable number of infinite - volume @xmath263-spin - flip stable states for any finite @xmath263 .",
    "this example illustrates a potential difficulty with numerical studies in higher dimensions , aimed at determining the number of ground or pure states : the presence of many metastable states could complicate interpretations of these studies .",
    "our hope is that this topical review has conveyed some of the depth and richness of the physics and mathematics of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of spin glasses .",
    "we conclude by returning briefly to question 7 , raised in sec .",
    "[ sec : open ] : in what ways do we now understand how the statistical mechanical treatment of systems with quenched disorder differs in fundamental ways from that of homogeneous systems ? in some sense ,",
    "much of this review focused on one or another aspect of this question , but it may be helpful for us to tie together some of the common threads that have run through much of this review .",
    "we emphasize that we will not attempt to provide a comprehensive or even an extensive answer to this question , which remains largely open , but will only focus on some of the insights that our analysis of the spin glass problem may have uncovered .",
    "( a similar discussion appears also in @xcite .",
    ")    most homogeneous systems that can be treated by classical equilibrium statistical mechanics share several salient features .",
    "whether one is studying crystals , ferromagnets , ferroelectrics , liquid crystals , or even some quantum systems such as superconductors and superfluids , the analysis of the low - temperature phase is simplified by various _",
    "symmetries , such as translational , orientational , gauge , and others .",
    "of course , no such symmetries are manifestly apparent in many disordered systems .",
    "it has also been known for many years @xcite that averaging over the quenched disorder presents additional complications . but this issue has been extensively discussed in many other reviews @xcite and will not be further addressed here .",
    "another complicating feature present in some ( but not all ) disordered systems is frustration .",
    "while frustration may also occur in homogeneous systems ( e.g. , triangular antiferromagnets ) , its joint presence with quenched disorder may result in more profound effects .",
    "we hereafter confine ourselves to systems with both disorder _ and _ frustration , taking the spin glass as their prototype .",
    "the nature of the low - temperature phase is a clear point of departure between homogeneous systems and spin glasses ( assuming they have a low - temperature phase ) .",
    "homogeneous systems typically display a relatively simple order parameter , representing the nature of ordering in a pure or ground state that is unique up to an overall simple symmetry transformation that leaves the hamiltonian invariant .",
    "it remains unknown whether the spin glass similarly possesses a simple order parameter in the ea model in finite dimensions , but it certainly does not in the infinite - ranged sk model .",
    "the striking contrast between the nature of broken symmetry in the rsb theory , as opposed to that present in most homogeneous systems , is clearly an important difference between them and infinite - ranged spin glasses .",
    "however , as extensively discussed in this review , it now appears that this type of broken symmetry is absent in short - ranged spin glass models .",
    "however , rather than seeing this as a disappointing piece of news , our viewpoint is that it is perhaps indicative of a far deeper contrast between spin glasses and simple homogeneous systems : in all such latter systems of which we are aware , mean field theory has been invaluable in providing the basic information concerning the nature of broken symmetry , order parameter(s ) , and low - temperature behavior in general .",
    "mean field theory s main shortcoming lies in its behavior very close to the transition temperature , but even this failure usually occurs only in sufficiently low dimensions ( which often includes the physically interesting case of @xmath336 ) : there usually exists an upper critical dimension above which mean field theory also provides the correct critical exponents .",
    "if the infinite - ranged sk model becomes exact for the ea model in infinite dimensions , as is commonly believed , then we have a new feature whose contrast with homogeneous systems is perhaps even more striking than the presence of rsb : that is , the failure of mean field theory to provide a correct description of the low - temperature phase , even far from the critical point , in _ any _ finite dimension .",
    "equivalently , the @xmath337 limit of the ea model is singular .",
    "this possibility was broached by fisher and huse @xcite , and our work confirms their conjecture . some of the reasons why mean field theory fails in any finite dimension are presented in sec .",
    "[ subsec : csdsk ] and reviewed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : summary ] .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the disconnect between the sk and ea models is profound @xcite : when one tries to transfer concepts in _ either _ direction , contradictory and even absurd results can ensue .",
    "one interesting question discussed in @xcite , worth repeating here , is whether a new type of thermodynamic object in place of states may be appropriate for understanding the meaning of replica symmetry breaking in the sk model .",
    "the usual notions of states are local ones : that is , they describe the behavior of correlation functions ( at fixed locations ) and related quantities .",
    "these notions do not seem to work for the sk model .",
    "this suggests the intriguing possibility that a more global object might be constructible that would provide a more natural ` fit ' for the sk model . we do not know whether this will turn out to be the case , but it is clear that if it does , such an object would be substantially different from the thermodynamic states that have been used up until now .",
    "a different issue concerns the nonexistence of a thermodynamic limit for states ( or equivalently , correlations ) .",
    "this is manifested as chaotic size dependence , and occurs when coupling - independent boundary conditions are used and there exist many observable pure states .",
    "this is really a reflection of the lack of any spatial symmetries that allow one to choose boundary conditions , or an external symmetry - breaking field , that can lead to the existence of such a limit .",
    "one could , of course , artificially obtain chaotic size dependence even in a simple homogeneous ferromagnet below @xmath64 by , say , choosing random boundary conditions independently in each @xmath7 .",
    "but there one also knows how to choose boundary conditions to obtain a limiting pure state , including the interface states , whose analogues would be invisible pure states in spin glasses ( sec .",
    "[ sec : interfaces ] ) .",
    "the option of choosing boundary conditions that lead to a limiting pure state does not now exist for spin glasses if they possess many pure state pairs ; and there may or may not be fundamental reasons preventing that option from ever becoming available .",
    "regardless of whether it does , it remains interesting and useful that the presence of chaotic size dependence provides a clear signal of the existence of many states ( sec .",
    "[ sec : csd ] ) .    besides chaotic size dependence",
    ", it has been speculated that spin glasses , both short - ranged and infinite - ranged , display _ chaotic temperature dependence _",
    ", as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : chaos ] .",
    "as indicated there , whether chaotic temperature dependence actually exists in spin glasses remains an open question .",
    "however , its potential presence in spin glasses represents a qualitatively new thermodynamic feature of at least some types of disordered systems .    a further contrast between homogeneous and disordered systems",
    "is provided by the presence of observability vs.  invisibility of different types of pure states .",
    "this is intimately interwoven with chaotic size dependence , and also with the nature of the interfaces separating these states ; these interfaces can , in principle , be different from those seen in homogeneous systems ( sec .",
    "[ sec : interfaces ] ) .",
    "these issues all arise from the use of coupling - dependent vs.  independent boundary conditions .",
    "no analogue for this distinction exists in homogeneous systems , but it is very possibly of basic importance in systems with quenched disorder .    finally , we would like to emphasize that if this entire discussion has uncovered any fundamental unifying principle , it is the set of ideas and techniques encapsulated in the construct of the _ metastate . _ it is our strong belief that any final understanding of the spin glass phase , and possibly that of other inhomogeneous systems , will make extensive use of this concept .    _",
