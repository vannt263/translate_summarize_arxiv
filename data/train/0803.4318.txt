    "light hadron spectroscopy lies beyond the realm of perturbative qcd .",
    "although lattice qcd provides , in principle , a rigorous way to extract non  perturbative quantities , present calculations use relatively high quark masses , at least for studies of scalar mesons , i. e. , @xcite .",
    "thus , appropriate extrapolation formulas are called for .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite provides such extrapolations , since it is built as an expansion in momenta and masses , generically @xmath6 , of a lagrangian involving the goldstone bosons of the qcd chiral symmetry breaking ( pions ) , compatible with all qcd symmetries .",
    "chpt is renormalized order by order by absorbing loop divergences in the parameters of higher order counterterms ( low energy constants - lecs ) , which are the coefficients of the energy and mass expansion , so _ they have no quark mass dependence_. their values depend on the qcd dynamics , and have to be determined from experiment . in su(2)-chpt @xmath7 scattering only four lecs appear , denoted @xmath8 .",
    "the chpt expansion provides a _ systematic and model independent _ description of how the observables depend on qcd parameters , like the quark masses , and this can be implemented systematically up to the desired order in the chpt expansion .",
    "we review here our recent derivation of a modified version of the iam @xcite ; based on dispersion theory , unitarity and chpt to next  to  leading order ( nlo ) , which we use to predict the quark mass dependence of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons @xcite .",
    "we focus only on the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 , so it is enough to work with the lightest quarks @xmath9 in the isospin limit with a mass @xmath10 . since",
    "@xmath4 is given by @xmath11 @xcite , studying the @xmath12 dependence is equivalent to study the @xmath4 dependence .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath0 resonances appear as poles in the second riemann sheet of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 partial waves of isospin @xmath15 and angular momentum @xmath16 respectively . for these partial waves , elastic unitarity implies , for physical values of @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath17 is the mandelstamm variable and",
    "@xmath19 is the center of mass momentum .",
    "consequently , the imaginary part of the inverse amplitude is known exactly .",
    "chpt amplitudes , being an expansion @xmath20 with @xmath21 , satisfy eq . just perturbatively : @xmath22 and can not generate poles .",
    "therefore the resonance region lies beyond the reach of standard chpt .",
    "however , it can be reached by combining chpt with dispersion theory either for the amplitude  @xcite or the inverse amplitude through the iam  @xcite .",
    "the elastic iam @xcite uses the chpt series and elastic unitarity to evaluate a dispersion relation for the inverse amplitude .",
    "the analytic structure of @xmath23 consists on a right cut from threshold to @xmath24 , a left cut from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , and possible poles coming from zeros of @xmath27 . for scalar waves",
    ", @xmath27 vanishes at the so called adler zero , @xmath28 , that lies on the real axis below threshold , thus within the chpt region of applicability .",
    "its position can be obtained from the chpt series , i.e. , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 vanishes at @xmath31 , @xmath32 at @xmath33 , etc .",
    "we write then a once subtracted dispersion relation for the inverse amplitude , where we have chosen the subtraction point to be the adler zero : @xmath34 where `` lc '' stands for a similar integral over the left cut and `` pc '' stands for the contribution of the pole at the adler zero . since @xmath30 is real on the real axis and @xmath35 has the same analytic structure as @xmath27,we",
    "can similarly write @xmath36 where we have now subtracted at @xmath31 , which is the lo approximation to the adler zero , and @xmath37 stands for the contribution of the pole at @xmath31 .",
    "we can now use unitarity , eqs . and , to find that the imaginary parts on the right cut of both dispersion relations are _ exactly opposite to each other_.",
    "since the lc integral is weighted at low energies , we can use chpt to approximate @xmath38 .",
    "the pole contribution @xmath39 can also be evaluated with chpt since it involves derivatives of @xmath27 evaluated at the adler zero , where chpt is perfectly justified .",
    "finally , we approximate with chpt @xmath40 . altogether , we find a modified iam ( miam ) formula : @xmath41}{s{-}s_a}.\\ ] ] the standard iam is recovered for @xmath42 , which holds exactly for all partial waves except the scalar ones . in the original iam derivation @xcite @xmath43 was neglected , since it formally yields a nnlo contribution and is numerically very small , except near the adler zero , where it diverges . however",
    ", if @xmath43 is neglected , the iam adler zero occurs at @xmath31 , correct only to lo , it is a double zero instead of a simple one , and a spurious pole of the amplitude appears close to the adler zero . all of these caveats are removed with the miam , eq . .",
    "the differences in the physical and resonance region between the iam and the miam are less than 1% . however , as we will see , for large @xmath4 the @xmath1 pole splits in two virtual poles below threshold , one of them moving towards zero and approaching the adler zero region , where the iam fails .",
    "thus , we will use for our calculations the miam , although it is only relevant for the mentioned second @xmath1 pole , and only when it is very close to the adler zero .",
    "by changing @xmath4 in the amplitudes we see how the poles generated with the iam evolve .",
    "we will use the lecs values @xmath44 and @xmath45 from @xcite and fit the miam to data up to the resonance region to find @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "these lecs are evaluated at @xmath48 mev .",
    "the values of @xmath4 considered should fall within the chpt range of applicability and allow for some elastic @xmath7 regime below @xmath49 threshold .",
    "both criteria are satisfied if @xmath50 mev , since @xmath51 chpt still works with such kaon masses , and because for @xmath52 mev , the kaon mass becomes @xmath53 , leaving 200 mev of elastic region .",
    "[ poles ] ( left ) shows the evolution of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 pole positions as @xmath4 is increased . in order to see the pole movements relative to the two pion threshold , which is also increasing ,",
    "all quantities are given in units of @xmath4 , so the threshold is fixed at @xmath54 .",
    "both poles moves closer to threshold and they approach the real axis .",
    "the @xmath0 poles reach the real axis as the same time that they cross threshold .",
    "one of them jumps into the first sheet and stays below threshold in the real axis as a bound state , while its conjugate partner remains on the second sheet practically at the very same position as the one in the first .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1 poles go below threshold with a finite imaginary part before they meet in the real axis , still on the second sheet , becoming virtual states . as @xmath4",
    "is increased further , one of the poles moves toward threshold and jumps through the branch point to the first sheet and stays in the real axis below threshold , very close to it as @xmath4 keeps growing .",
    "the other @xmath1 pole moves down in energies further from threshold and remains on the second sheet .",
    "this analytic structure , with two very asymmetric poles in different sheets for a scalar wave , could be a signal of a prominent molecular component @xcite .",
    "similar pole movements have been also found within quark models @xcite .",
    "note that chpt has ben used to evaluate the subtraction constants at the adler zero and the low energy part of lc , _ always far from the resonance poles _",
    ", even when they move below threshold , as shwon in fig .",
    "[ poles ] ( left ) , being the use of chpt perfectly justified .    in fig .",
    "[ massandwidth ] ( left ) we show the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath55 ( defined from the pole position @xmath56 ) , normalized to their physical values .",
    "the bands cover the lecs uncertainties .",
    "we see that both masses grow with @xmath4 , but @xmath55 grows faster than @xmath5 . below @xmath57 mev",
    "we only show one line because the two conjugate @xmath1 poles have the same mass . above 330 mev",
    ", these two poles lie on the real axis with two different masses .",
    "the heavier pole goes towards threshold and around @xmath58 moves into the first sheet .",
    "note also that the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath55 is much softer than suggested in @xcite , shown as the dotted line , which in addition does not show the two virtual poles .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ massandwidth ] we show the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath59 and @xmath60 normalized to their physical values , where we see that both widths become smaller .",
    "we compare this decrease with the expected reduction from phase space as the resonances approach the @xmath7 threshold .",
    "we find that @xmath59 follows very well this expected behavior , which implies that the @xmath3 coupling is almost @xmath4 independent .",
    "in contrast @xmath60 shows a different behavior from the phase space reduction expectation .",
    "this suggest a strong @xmath4 dependence of the @xmath1 coupling to two pions , necessarily present for molecular states @xcite .",
    "[ poles ] ( right ) is a comparison of our results for @xmath5 with some lattice results @xcite , which deserves several words of caution .",
    "our @xmath5 is the `` pole mass '' , which is deep in the complex plane , and , due to the momentum discretization induced by the finite lattice volume , the minimum energy with which pions are produced is larger than the resulting @xmath5 , so the lattice rho has no width .",
    "we can mimic in our formalism a narrower @xmath0 by increasing the number of colors , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we also show the result for the rho mass for @xmath62 .",
    "we see that making the @xmath0 artificially narrower yields a better agreement with lattice data . with these caveats in mind our results",
    "are in qualitative agreement with those of the lattice .",
    "following @xcite one may write @xmath63 , where the @xmath64 parameters are expected to be of order one and @xmath65 gev , which is confirmed by a fit to lattice data @xcite .",
    "we can fit our results and predict @xmath66 mev and @xmath67 .",
    "although the pion mass dependence of our calculation is steeper than that of the lattice , the values obtained are still consistent with the expectations mentioned above .",
    "let us remind that the @xmath4 dependence in our approach is correct only up to nlo in chpt .",
