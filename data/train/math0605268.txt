    "recall , that artin braid group on @xmath0 strands is the group given by the following generators and relations : @xmath1=1 , |i - j| \\ge 2 ; x_ix_{i+1}x_i = x_{i+1}x_ix_{i+1 } \\right>.\\ ] ]    the braid group admits a geometric presentation which we shall use throughout this paper .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "the idea is to associate to every word in the @xmath2 s a plane diagram , which is obtained by successively concatenating the diagrams of letters , they are given by figure [ pic : cross ] .",
    "we shall make use of another definition , closely linked to the geometric presentation of braids .",
    "if two strands cross , then this we call a crossing ( on figure [ pic : cross ] the crossings of the @xmath3-th and the @xmath4-th strands are shown ) . to every letter @xmath5 of a braid word @xmath6 we associate a ` crossing ' of two strands .",
    "consider the diagram of @xmath7 .",
    "the letters of @xmath7 are in one - to - one correspondence with the crossings of the diagram of @xmath7 .",
    "so , depending on the position of the letter @xmath5 in the word @xmath7 the crossing corresponding to @xmath5 may be different .",
    "for instance , to the letter @xmath8 in the word @xmath9 corresponds the crossing of the first and the second strand , while in the word @xmath10 the crossing linked to @xmath8 is the crossing of the first and the third strands ( see figure [ pic:1 ] ) .",
    "depending on the sign of the generator the sign of crossing can be positive or negative .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the crossing of the @xmath12-th and the @xmath13-th strands .",
    "thus the crossing is completely defined when we fix the numbers @xmath12 and @xmath13 and the sign .",
    "we say that a crossing is negative , whenever the corresponding letter of the word is the inverse of one of the generators @xmath14 and positive otherwise .",
    "thus , the natural notion of the _ ` sign ' _ @xmath15 of a crossing arises .    from the foregoing discussion",
    "we conclude that braid words can be treated as sequences of crossings .",
    "note that any crossing , consider @xmath16 , for instance , can correspond to different generators @xmath17 , depending on the word and the position of a generator in the word ( see figure [ pic:2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we offer the reader to check that the following remark holds    let @xmath18 be an arbitrary crossing .",
    "then there exists a braid word @xmath19 and a letter @xmath5 in @xmath19 so that the crossing corresponding to @xmath5 in @xmath19 is @xmath20 , here @xmath21 .",
    "we next formulate the main result of the current paper .",
    "[ thm : nf ] let @xmath22 be the braid group on @xmath0 strands . every element @xmath23 can be uniquely written in the form @xmath24 where for every @xmath25 the words @xmath26 are freely reduced and the crossings involved into @xmath26 are the crossings of the form @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) only .",
    "this is roughly saying that for given braid there exists a unique braid , which is equivalent to the initial one and is ` constructed ' in the following way : first one entangles the first and the second strand @xmath29 times and the first and the second strands do not cross further .",
    "then one entangles the third strand with the second and the first ( this is @xmath30 ) so that furtheron there are no crossings of the first and the second strands with the third strand , then one entangles the fourth strand with the third , the second and the first ( this is @xmath31 ) and so on .",

    "we draw reader s attention to the fact that in the normal form given in the above corollary the power of the first letter @xmath8 has an arbitrary degree @xmath29 and that the terminal letter of @xmath19 may be any letter ( @xmath8 or @xmath41 ) in any power @xmath42 .",
    "consider the word @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is an odd integer and @xmath45 .",
    "this braid is in normal form , since only the third strand is entangled .",
    "if we now look at @xmath19 as a word written as in corollary [ cor : b3 ] , we have @xmath46 and , since @xmath8 is the terminal letter of @xmath19 , it may be in an arbitrary power ( not necessarily even ) .    moreover , the word @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , is in normal form .    in paper @xcite e.  artin ( and a.  markov in @xcite )",
    "proves that every pure braid can be transformed into the form ( [ eq : nf ] ) .",

    "every element of @xmath22 can be written as a product of a pure braid and a coset representative of @xmath22 modulo the group of pure braids @xmath49 .",
    "normal form ( [ eq : nf ] ) , therefore , generalises artin - markoff normal form ( see @xcite and @xcite ) to all ( not necessarily pure ) braids and admits a natural geometric description .",
    "moreover , in section [ sec : proof ] , we construct a gathering process which transforms a given word into the form ( [ eq : nf ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above in the case when @xmath19 is a pure braid , normal form ( [ eq : nf ] ) coincides with artin - markoff normal form , given by theorem 17 , @xcite ( see as well @xcite ) . for the sake of convenience and completeness we expose this theorem below .    by the definition set @xmath50 for @xmath51 set @xmath52    [ thm : art ]",

    "every pure braid can be uniquely written in the form : @xmath54 where each @xmath55 is a uniquely determined power product of the @xmath56 using only those with @xmath57 .    in @xcite",
    "the author reads the words from right to left and draws diagrams moving upwards .",
    "the diagrams ( in our interpretation ) of elements @xmath58 take the form shown on figure [ pic : aij ] .    in @xcite",
    "the author introduces the elements @xmath56 s to make normal form ( [ eq : nf ] ) a unique word in the @xmath56 s ( however the elements @xmath56 s can be presented by different braid words ) . choose the word representative of the element @xmath56 to be @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "notice next that in this case the braid word @xmath56 entangles the @xmath61-th strand only , leaving the other @xmath62 strands unentangled ( see figure [ pic : aij ] ) .",
    "finally , minding the insignificant difference in the geometric interpretation of braid words and noticing that the elements @xmath63 in ( [ eq : art ] ) are uniquely determined elements of @xmath22 ( in @xcite the @xmath55 s are words in the symbols @xmath56 s ) , we conclude that for pure braids the elements @xmath64 in normal form ( [ eq : nf ] ) coincide with , correspondingly , @xmath63 in equation ( [ eq : art ] ) .    ,",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ thm : nf ] .",
    "we also provide an algorithm ( a gathering process ) for constructing normal form ( [ eq : nf ] ) .",
    "we first prove that every braid word @xmath23 can be taken to the word in the form ( [ eq : nf ] ) . and then prove that there exists only a unique word of the form ( [ eq : nf ] ) equal to @xmath19 in @xmath22 .",

    "first we transform the word @xmath19 into the form in which every big crossing is gathered in the end of the word , @xmath67 .",
    "then we apply a similar process to @xmath68 and take it in the form in which every crossing that involves the @xmath62-th strand is collected in the end of the word , @xmath69 and so on .    before we begin to give a formal description of our algorithm we give a less formal description of the idea it uses .",
    "given an arbitrary word @xmath70 we consider it as a sequence of crossings .",
    "take the first small crossing @xmath71 in @xmath19 so that there are big crossings preceding @xmath71 ( i.e. the corresponding letters are closer to the beginning of @xmath19 ) .",
    "the word @xmath19 then has the following form @xmath72 .",
    "where in @xmath73 all the crossings are small , in @xmath74 all the crossings are big , @xmath75 is a letter and the corresponding crossing is @xmath71 and @xmath76 is simply the rest of the word .",
    "we then , using transformations given by figures [ pic : pv ] and [ pic : repl ] , move this crossing upwards ( preserving the braid ) till there are no big crossings in @xmath19 preceding @xmath71 . applying the same procedure to every small crossing in @xmath19",
    "we get its decomposition in the form @xmath77    we begin to construct a gathering process that transforms an arbitrary braid word @xmath19 into the form @xmath67 , where every crossing in @xmath78 is big and every crossing in @xmath68 is small .    by the diagram shown on figure [ pic:3 ] we denote an arbitrary braid on @xmath0 strands .",

    "however there is a dramatic difference between a random braid and a random freely reduced word .",
    "for example , the results of @xcite and @xcite show that a random braid has got a nontrivial centraliser ( its centraliser differs from the center of @xmath22 ) with a non - zero probability , while computational results show , that the centraliser of a random reduced word in the free group , treated as an element of @xmath22 is trivial .    to generate a random braid on @xmath0 strands we can use theorem [ thm : nf ] , for instance , as follows .",
    "here we use the ideas of @xcite , whereto we refer the reader for details and justification of the method .",

    "we construct a confluent string rewriting system , whose output will be a string in the form ( [ eq : nfcr ] ) .    to construct a rewriting system",

    "the set of rules ( [ eq : i1])([eq : d ] ) gives rise to a confluent term rewriting system on the set of sequences of crossings , which represent braid words .    by the definition , a rewriting system is confluent whenever the order of application of rules does not matter ,",

    "since @xmath306 at least one of them does not coincide with @xmath305 .",
    "suppose that @xmath307 .",
    "then , by remark [ rem : preserve ] , @xmath303 corresponds to a braid , and therefore , on account of theorem [ thm : nf ] ( see also section [ ss : exist ] ) , we can take @xmath303 to @xmath305 by the means of the rules ( [ eq : i1])([eq : d ] )  a contradiction .",
    "@xmath308    the set of all sequences of crossings that correspond to normal form ( [ eq : nfcr ] ) of elements of the braid group @xmath22 is regular .    by remark [ rem : seqcrreg ]",

    "since the collection of rules ( [ eq : i1])([eq : d ] ) is finite , the set of all sequences of crossings that do not contain the left - hand sides of rules is regular .",
    "the statement now follows , for the intersection of two regular sets is regular .",
    "in this section we show how one can obtain an analogue of the form ( [ eq : nf ] ) for an artin group of finite type @xmath309 .",
    "any artin group of type @xmath310 embeds into a braid group on sufficiently many strands and the embedding is fairly natural , see @xcite for details .",
    "for example , the group @xmath186 embeds into @xmath35 as follows : @xmath311 . using this embedding and",
    "the normal form constructed in this paper one can obtain similar geometric normal forms for @xmath186 ( and any other artin group of type @xmath310 ) .",
    "however , we want to explicitly demonstrate the generalisation of the idea used to construct normal forms in braid groups and show how one can construct normal forms in @xmath186 ` barehanded ' .",
    "consider the corresponding coxeter group @xmath187 . as it is well - known ,",
    "see for instance @xcite , @xmath187 can be treated as a group , generated by the following reflections of a square : @xmath312 and @xmath313 , where the corresponding square has the form : @xmath314 we use this notation to express , that @xmath315 is the reflection of the square that permutes vertices @xmath316 and @xmath317 and @xmath318 is the reflection of the square that permutes @xmath316 with @xmath319 , and @xmath317 with @xmath320 : @xmath321    we next consider every element of @xmath186 as a sequence of elements of @xmath187 .",

    "all the above elements , but @xmath330 involve the @xmath320-th vertice of the square .    in the case of braid groups ,",
    "the crossing @xmath331 of two strands can correspond to any generator ( since all the permutations @xmath332 are conjugate in the coxeter group , which corresponds to the braid group , i. e. the group of permutations on @xmath0 symbols ) .",
    "however , only the elements @xmath331 and @xmath324 of the group @xmath187 can correspond to the generator @xmath333 ( treated as a subword of a word of @xmath186 ) , since @xmath331 is the image of @xmath333 in @xmath187 and @xmath324 is the only element of @xmath187 conjugate to @xmath331 .",
