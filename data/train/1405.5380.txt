    "in strong - field and attosecond physics , combinations of femto- and attosecond pulses are used to retrieve time - resolved information about electronic and nuclear motion  @xcite .",
    "simple physical pictures based on a reduction of the complex many - body dynamics of an atom or molecule under a short pulse to the consideration of a single - active - electron ( sae ) have been instrumental in developing the methods of the research field  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , experimental and theoretical investigations are shifting toward more detailed and fundamental analyses of dynamics requiring an account of electron correlation for their complete understanding .",
    "for example , attosecond absorption spectroscopy was used to observe and control electronic dynamics  @xcite , the attosecond streak camera was used to determine the intrinsic time delay of photoionization from different orbitals  @xcite , and the mechanism of quantum tunneling was elucidated by the attoclock technique  @xcite and by high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "these elaborate experiments call for reliable _ ab initio _ time - dependent ( td ) many - electron theories to analyze the results in minute detail without neglecting electron correlation .    among recent developments of many - electron theories , the td configuration - interaction singles ( tdcis )",
    "method  @xcite is the simplest framework beyond the sae approximation . the tdcis expansion relative to the hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state provides a set of working equations which are numerically tractable even for large atoms .",
    "another strategy for dealing with the many - electron dynamics is the td hartree - fock ( tdhf ) method  @xcite or its generalization , i.e. , the muticonfigurational tdhf ( mctdhf ) method  @xcite where the wave function is expressed by a full - ci expansion with td orbitals .",
    "the key idea in the mctdhf approach is to optimize the orbitals at each time step by the self - consistent - field ( scf ) ansatz , which allows the use of a relatively small number of orbitals for constructing the wave function .",
    "while in the perturbative regime for the matter - light interaction , the mctdhf method can be applied to relatively large systems as illustrated by the computation of inner - shell photoionization cross sections for molecular hydrogen fluoride  @xcite , in general , due to the full - ci expansion , the number of configurations in the mctdhf method exponentially increases with respect to the number of electrons , which thus makes the method infeasible for systems having more than a few electrons interacting with intense light fields  @xcite . as a way to cure the undesirable scaling property of the mctdhf method , the td complete - active - space scf ( td - casscf ) method was presented  @xcite . in this method",
    "the number of configurations is reduced by introducing core orbitals , which , however , eventually will compromise the accurate description of core excitation processes .",
    "meanwhile , quite a few methodologies have been developed in quantum chemistry to circumvent the expensive full - ci expansion for describing ground - state wave functions of atoms and molecules ( see , e.g. , the textbook  @xcite ) .",
    "the most primitive way is a simple truncation of the ci expansion at a certain excitation level : ci singles ( cis ) , singles - and - doubles ( cisd ) , singles - doubles - and - triples ( cisdt ) , and so forth .",
    "a more advanced concept is the restricted - active - space ( ras ) scheme , where the orbitals are classified into three groups , so - called active spaces , between which excitations are allowed with certain restrictions  @xcite . in our recent paper  @xcite , as a generalization of the mctdhf and td - casscf methods , we presented a general formulation of the td - rasscf method with special emphasis on the td - rasscf - doubles ( d ) ansatz . in the td - rasscf - d method , only double - orbital excitations are allowed between the active spaces , and this restriction reduces the algorithmic complexity associated with solving the working equations of the theory , as will be revisited in this paper .",
    "a related method is the orbital adaptive time - dependent coupled - cluster - doubles approach  @xcite .",
    "although the orbitals are self - consistently optimized at each time step , due to the lack of the explicit treatment of single - orbital excitations , the numerical accuracy of the doubles - only approaches could be questioned in terms of how reliably the method describes single - electron dynamics which is , e.g. , always a key process in strong - field ionization .",
    "we have two aims with this paper .",
    "the first is to present extensions of the td - rasscf - d method and to study their numerical performance and accuracy . by including the single- , double- , and triple - orbital excitations , in analogy to the cis , cisd , and cisdt methods , the td - rasscf - s  @xcite , -sd , and -sdt methods",
    "are formulated based on the dirac - frenkel - mclachlan td variational principle  @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the td - rasscf - s method has a special convergence property : the fully converged wave function can be obtained using a small number of orbitals ( typically smaller than the number of electrons ) , and the converged td - rasscf - s wave function can be more accurate than the tdcis wave function in the sense of the td variational principle . furthermore , in this paper , td - rasscf - d is shown to be more accurate than td - rasscf - s in practice , and the td - rasscf - s and -d methods are equally feasible for large systems .",
    "the more accurate methods , td - rasscf - sd , and -sdt , are computationally more expensively but successfully describe phenomena which require a more accurate treatment of the electron correlation .",
    "the flexible tunability of the accuracy and cost is a particular advantageous feature of the td - rasscf method .",
    "the second aim of this paper is to analyze the laser - induced dynamics involved in hhg . by carrying out computations of excitation probabilities and state - resolved analysis of hhg spectra based on field - free time - independent hf orbitals , contributions to the spectra from multi - orbital excitations",
    "are clarified .",
    "these contributions cause the break - down of the sae approximation and the tdcis method . on the other hand ,",
    "both the td - rasscf - s and -d methods succeed in describing the multi - orbital excitations accurately .",
    "another noticeable advantage of the td - rasscf method is the gauge independence , i.e. , the laser - induced dynamics can be computed without concern about the possible influence of the choice of either length , velocity , or acceleration gauge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
