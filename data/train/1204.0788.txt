    "characteristics of the maser emission itself can be used to measure extragalactic magnetic fields ( via zeeman splitting ) and gas kinematics , while the _ presence _ of an ohm is a signpost for phenomena associated with galaxy mergers , including extreme star formation and merging black holes .",
    "ohms are a unique tool in this respect due to their extreme luminosities and ability to be seen at cosmic distances .",

    "no ohms at a distance of greater than 1300  mpc ( @xmath10 ) have been detected , and no large , systematic searches for high-@xmath11 ohms have been carried out .",
    "the association of ohms with ir - bright merging galaxies , however , means that the density of ohms is expected to be much higher at @xmath12 , coinciding with an increase in both merging rate and cosmic star formation .",
    "we have conducted a search for high - redshift ohms using the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "we constructed three samples of galaxies to search for high - redshift ohms .",
    "none of the samples are fully complete or flux - limited , but draw on the catalogs of ir - luminous galaxies with well - defined redshifts that were available at the time .",
    "the first sample of galaxies consisted of iras sources included in the redshift catalog of the pscz survey .",
    "galaxies were selected according to similar criteria as in the flux - limited arecibo sample , but included objects lying outside the declination limits of arecibo ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "galaxies selected for gbt observations had : a declination range of @xmath14 or @xmath15 , a redshift range of @xmath16 , and a lower - luminosity threshold of @xmath17 .",
    "153 galaxies in the pscz met these criteria , of which 47 of the brightest candidates were observed according to the lst windows during the early commissioning phase of the gbt in 2002 .    the second sample of potential ohm hosts was assembled from flux - limited catalogs of ulirgs at higher redshifts .",
    "we began with 35 galaxies in the fsc - first catalog @xcite , which consists of targets detected in both the iras faint source catalog and the 20-cm vla first survey .",
    "this was supplemented with 5 ir - bright galaxy pairs and 26 sub - millimetre galaxies .",
    "all galaxies have @xmath18 , with more than half having @xmath19 .",
    "the highest redshift in this sample is at @xmath20 .",
    "the third group of 19 ohm candidates was the last observed in our program , and made explicit use of the results from the first two samples .",
    "targets were selected from the cosmos field , a 2-deg@xmath21 survey with deep spectral coverage from x - ray through radio wavelengths .",
    "recent infrared @xcite studies show that while ohms are found in infrared - bright galaxies , the ohm fraction is much higher for starburst - dominated galaxies vs. agn .",
    "selection of ohm candidates began with cosmos galaxies detected by _ spitzer _ at 70  @xmath22 m , and then eliminating all targets except the lirgs , ulirgs , and hylirgs identified by @xcite .",
    "we removed all galaxies identified as agn or with @xmath23 .",
    "finally , we culled the target list based on the expected rfi conditions near the observed frequency bands . by limiting the observed oh frequencies to cleaner regions",
    ", we have a broader margin for error on the galaxy redshift .",

    "all nine ohms have redshifts near the lower end of the sample distribution , with the most distant lying at a redshift of @xmath32 .",
    "the observed frequencies are in the range of @xmath33  mhz , which is covered by the l - band receiver and has relatively little rfi compared to the gbt prime focus bands .",
    "the oh emission has been confirmed with gbt follow - up observations for five of the galaxies .",

    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the 18-cm radio properties of the new ohm detections .",
    "we give the galaxy s optical redshift ( @xmath34 ) , peak flux density of the ohm ( @xmath35 ) , the ratio of the integrated 1667  mhz emission to its peak flux density ( @xmath36 ) , measured oh luminosity ( log  @xmath37 ) , and predicted oh luminosity ( @xmath38 ) based on the @xmath39 relationship in @xcite .",
    "112 galaxies showed no confirmed detections of oh . the @xmath40  for each galaxy was ( conservatively ) derived assuming a boxcar line profile with a linewidth @xmath41  km  s@xmath30  and a 1.5@xmath42 detection .",
    "the rms was measured from baseline - subtracted continuum centered on the optical redshift of the galaxy and in a frequency range sufficient to cover the uncertainty in the optical redshift ( @xmath43 $ ] ) .",
    "one of the goals of performing a search for ohms at higher redshifts was to improve the measurements of the oh megamaser luminosity function ( lf ) .",

    "this measurement was limited to a narrow redshift range , spanning @xmath47 .",
    "we constructed a new oh lf by combining the gbt and arecibo ohm detections , using the @xmath48 method and combining limits on both spectral line and continuum emission . we fit a power - law to all bins with more than one detection , yielding :    @xmath49=(-0.66\\pm0.14)~{\\rm log}~l_{oh } - ( 4.91\\pm0.41),\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is measured in mpc@xmath46  dex@xmath30 and @xmath37 in @xmath51 .",
    "the new detections only change the slope measured by @xcite by @xmath52 and the offset by @xmath53 .",
    "both values are well within the uncertainties of the combined lf , as well as that of the original arecibo lf .    assuming the malmquist - corrected relationship of @xmath54 from @xcite , this gives @xmath55\\propto l_{ir}^{-0.83\\pm0.18}$ ] .",
    "we compare this to the lf of ulirgs in the local universe using the akari measurements of @xcite .",
    "folding in the ohm fraction derived from the combined arecibo and gbt samples results in a slope of @xmath56 , a much shallower value than that measured from the akari galaxies @xmath57 .",
    "this inconsistency may suggest either that ohms are highly saturated or that the maser strength is only weakly correlated with global properties such as @xmath58 ( * ? ? ? * ( darling & giovanelli 2002a ) ) .",
    "the ohm lf of @xcite assumed a quadratic oh - ir relation corresponding to unsaturated masing ; a decrease in saturation could potentially steepen the ohm lf up to a slope of @xmath59 .",
    "one of the ultimate goals of high - redshift ohm surveys is to use megamasers as tracers of the populations of merging galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "models of the merger rate as a function of redshift are typically parameterized with an evolutionary factor of @xmath7 .",
    "the value of @xmath60 , however , is not well - constrained ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ( _ e.g. , _ kim & sanders 1998 ; bridge  2010 ) ) . sufficiently deep surveys of ohms can provide an independent measurement of the parametrization of the merging rate .",
    "we calculated the predicted sky density of ohms as a function of redshift :    @xmath61 = \\frac{c d_l^2}{h_0\\nu_0\\sqrt{(1+z)^3\\omega_m + \\omega_\\lambda } } \\left(\\frac{b}{a~{\\rm ln } 10}\\right ) \\times \\nonumber \\\\ \\left((l_{oh , max})^a - ( l_{oh , min})^a\\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are parameters of the ohm lf from equation  [ eqn - ohlf_combined ] ( @xmath64=b l_{oh}^a$ ] ) , @xmath65 is the minimum oh luminosity that can be observed at a given sensitivity level , and @xmath66 is the upper physical limit on ohm luminosity ( * ? ? ? * ( darling & giovanelli 2002b ) ) .",
    "using the upper limit of zero ohms detected in the cosmos field , we place an upper limit on the merger rate of @xmath67 .",
    "while this is still within uncertainties for the highest estimated values of @xmath60 , the cosmos limit is an important first step in using ohms as an independent tracer .",
    "further measurements of oh deep fields at higher redshifts will be crucial for a more accurate constraint .",
    "the final results for the gbt ohm survey yielded a much lower detection rate ( 9/121 = 7% ) of megamasers than expected . based on the high detection fraction for galaxies with @xmath5 from the arecibo survey ,",
    "in addition to our careful selection of starburst - dominated galaxies , we had predicted a success rate of 2030% .",
    "we attribute one of the primary causes of the low ohm fraction to be the sensitivity of the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the upper limits for ohm candidates from our survey , along with the necessary rms sensitivity to detect oh lines as a function of redshift . to detect median - luminosity ohms at @xmath68",
    "will require rms levels of 100  @xmath22jy , and perhaps significantly more time devoted to individual targets .",
    "it must also be mentioned that rfi is a major culprit at @xmath69  ghz , significantly restricting the redshift path and increasing the noise in each receiver band .",
    "future ohm searches may benefit from interferometric observations ( for which celestial rfi is uncorrelated from dish to dish ) , or from observations in more radio - quiet environments .",
    "the gmrt ( india ) and askap ( australia ) are promising instruments for interferometry , while the upcoming 64-m sardinia radio telescope ( italy ) and 500-m fast ( china ) will be options to continue the search for ohms at high redshifts .",
