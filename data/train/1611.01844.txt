    "in the lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath7cdm ) cosmological paradigm , galaxies are formed from the cooling and condensation of gas in the center of dark matter halos ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "a challenge for astronomers is to link the properties of present - day galaxies to their parent host halos with the aid of observations and cosmological simulations .",
    "statistical methods , based on cosmological simulations , to address the interdependence between the dark halo and the stellar mass are the halo occupation distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) or the conditional luminosity function ( e.g. @xcite ) , which use large galaxy surveys to calculate the probability distribution of a given halo to host certain number of galaxies of particular properties ( e.g. total luminosity ) .",
    "similarly , abundance matching ( e.g. @xcite ) links the abundances of halos ( and subhalos ) to those of galaxies , under the assumption of a monotonic relation between the dark matter and the stellar mass .",
    "the stellar - to - halo mass ratio can also be measured directly based on lensing analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) or the dynamics of satellite galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .    from the above techniques",
    ", it has been found that the stellar - to - halo mass ratio as a function of halo mass , predicted from @xmath7cdm cosmological simulations , has a maximum near @xmath9 , where the star formation efficiency is highest , and drops towards lower- and larger - mass halos .",
    "this trend is thought to arise from the combined effect of supernova feedback , which is more efficient at reheating and dislodging the gas in low - mass halos , and agn feedback , which is more effective in high mass halos ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "combining the disk rotation curves inferred from 3.6  @xmath0 m photometry with the hi velocity measurements from the literature , daz - garca et al .",
    "( @xcite ) obtained an estimate of the halo - to - stellar mass ratio ( @xmath3 ) within the optical radius .",
    "systems with @xmath10 or @xmath11 were found to be more dark matter dominated inside the optical disk than their early - type galaxies ( in agreement with @xcite and @xcite ) , which most likely affects the disk stability properties .",
    "using first - order rotation curve decomposition models ( @xcite ) , which were based on universal rotation curve models , we showed that only @xmath12 of the non - highly inclined galaxies in the s@xmath13 g were maximal according to the criterion by @xcite .    under the assumption that the halo within the optical disk contributes approximately a constant fraction of the total halo mass ( @xmath8 ) , daz - garca et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found that the trend of the @xmath5 relation agreed with the prediction of @xmath7cdm models , fitted at @xmath14 based on abundance matching and halo occupation distribution methods ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "using the polar method in nir - qb code ( @xcite,@xcite ) , we inferred the gravitational potential of 1154 disk galaxies ( @xmath1 in s@xmath13 g pipeline 4 , @xcite ) from the deprojected 3.6  @xmath0 m photometric images ( @xcite ) , taken from the s@xmath13 g sample ( @xcite ) . from the gravitational potential of the galaxies and their mean radial force field , we calculated the disk+bulge stellar contribution to the circular velocity as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the galactocentric radius , @xmath17 corresponds to the radial force obtained for @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the mass - to - light ratio at 3.6  @xmath0 m obtained by @xcite , which is assumed to be constant throughout the disk .",
    "we estimate the maximum circular velocities of the galaxies ( @xmath20 ) from the hi line widths ( @xmath21 ) , available in the cosmic flows project ( @xcite,@xcite ) and hyperleda , corrected for the disk inclination ( from @xcite ) : @xmath22 using @xmath23 and @xmath20 , we obtained a first - order estimate of the halo - to - stellar mass ratio ( @xmath24 ) within the optical radius ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xmath25 is defined as the radius enclosing @xmath26 of the light in the blue band , what corresponds to @xmath27 for an exponential disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath28 is taken from @xcite .",
    "we assumed that ( i ) the gas contribution to the rotation curve is modest at the optical radius ( e.g. @xcite ) , ( ii ) the circular velocity at @xmath25 is approximately the observed maximum velocity : @xmath29 and ( iii ) the disks are exponential .",
    "based on these assumptions we derive @xmath30 where @xmath31 corresponds to the ratio between the mass contained by a spherical distribution and that enclosed by an exponential disk yielding a similar radial force at @xmath25 @xcite . in the range @xmath32 , @xmath33",
    "in fig .  [ figuredm ]",
    "we show the halo - to - stellar mass ratio within the optical radius as a function of total stellar mass ( @xmath4 , taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath35-@xmath4 statistical trend agrees with the prediction of the best - fit model at @xmath14 in the @xmath7cdm predictions from cosmological simulations , if the models are scaled down by a factor @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ figuredm ] , and also fig .  6 in @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the amount of dark matter within the optical disk is @xmath37 that of the total host halo , on average .    despite the large scatter",
    ", the predicted turnover at the high mass end ( @xmath38 ) in the @xmath7cdm models seems to follow the observations too , but a more complete sampling of the early - type galaxies is needed .",

    "[ rotcurve ] we reassess the relation between the halo - to - stellar mass ratio and @xmath4 , successfully reproducing the slope expected from the @xmath7cdm cosmological simulations .",
    "the reported relation between @xmath4 and @xmath3 means that the present - day galaxies tend to keep in memory the mass of their host ( sub)halos , where the gas cooled down to form them , even inside the optical radius ( @xmath12 of the halo virial radius ) .",
    "we reinforce the idea that dark matter and baryonic matter are intimately coupled in disk galaxies ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    however , the @xmath41 relation shows a large scatter .",
    "part of this scatter might be due to uncertainties of the hi line widths , which are not the optimal tracer of the halo potential .",
    "partly , it can also arise from the assumption that the gas component is negligible at the optical radius , which might not be true for the faintest systems . in individual galaxies ,",
    "the scatter can be a consequence of a non accurately estimated",

    "besides , our definition of @xmath39 can be oversimplified .",
    "nonetheless , most probably part of the scatter in the @xmath41 relation also has a physical origin . since their birth ,",
    "galaxy undergo several changes that have an external origin ( @xcite ) ( e.g. galaxy mergers , gas inflow , or galaxy harassment ) that are expected to make the halo - to - stellar mass ratio varying to a certain degree in a cosmic time .",

    "( @xcite ) confirmed the scaling relation between the inner slope of the rotation curve and the central surface brightness of the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "this links the inner density of the potential well to the central stellar density .",
    "we found that this scaling relation could be recovered by only using the stellar component of the circular velocity , confirming that baryonic mass seems to dominate the dynamics in the inner regions ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this also manifested in the dependence of the inner velocity gradient ( baryons+dark matter ) on the bulge - to - total mass ratio and the bulge mass .",
    "we find that the amount of dark matter within the optical disk of s@xmath13 g galaxies , estimated from the hi line widths available in the literature , scales with the total stellar mass estimated from mid - infrared images , in a manner expected from the @xmath7cdm models ( e.g. @xcite ) . on average ,",
