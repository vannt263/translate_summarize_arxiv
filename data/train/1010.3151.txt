    "the cleo - c experiment @xcite at the cesr - c ( cornell electron storage ring - charm ) @xmath4 collider has collected large data samples in the charm threshold energy region .",
    "open charm samples have allowed the cleo - c experiment to have an impact on measurements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , improved our knowledge of hadronic @xmath1 and @xmath3 decays , and enabled studies of rare charm processes .",
    "precision measurements of the weak phases that compose the unitarity triangle ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ) allow us to test the internal consistency of the ckm model and search for signatures of new physics . the ckm phase @xmath7 is only constrained by direct measurements to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the most promising methods of determining the ckm phase @xmath7 exploit the interference within @xmath9 decays , where the neutral @xmath1 meson is a @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the most straightforward of these strategies considers two - body final states of the @xmath1 meson , but additional information can be gained from strategies that consider multi - body final states .",
    "the parameters associated with the specific final states needed for these analyses can be extracted from correlations within cleo - c @xmath12 data .",
    "lattice qcd theory offers the prospect of a systematically - improvable method of calculating hadronic properties from first principles . in the past decade ,",
    "theoretical and technological advances have allowed lattice qcd to provide precise predictions that estimate systematic uncertainties reliably .",
    "an exciting application of these results allows the extraction of electroweak parameters in the @xmath13 meson system .",
    "however , it is desirable to test them elsewhere , for example in the charm system , and cleo - c provides excellent data for these tests .",
    "the cleo - c detector was a symmetric general purpose detector that provided excellent electromagnetic calorimetry , charged particle tracking and identification , and near 4@xmath14 solid angular coverage .",
    "the experiment is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the relevant data sets for the following analyses were collected at center of mass energies of approximately @xmath15 gev ( the peak of the @xmath12 resonance ) and @xmath16 gev .",
    "the former data set is used for @xmath17 and @xmath18 analyses , and the latter for @xmath3 physics . except where noted ,",
    "all analyses use the full cleo - c data sets of @xmath19 at @xmath15 gev and @xmath20 at @xmath16 gev .    at 3.77 gev the only allowed open charm final states are @xmath21 and @xmath22 . at 4.17 gev the only allowed states involving a @xmath3 meson are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "since only two @xmath1 mesons of opposite flavor are produced , we may use the double tagging technique pioneered by mark iii @xcite .",
    "this allows cleo - c to obtain very clean samples of charm meson decays , with minimal combinatoric background . in particular , using neutral @xmath1 meson tags allow us to exploit quantum correlations of the initial state ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "also , neutrinos and @xmath26 mesons may be inferred via the full reconstruction of the observed particles in an event .",
    "atwood , dunietz and soni ( ads ) @xcite have suggested considering @xmath1 decays to non-@xmath29 eigenstates as a way of maximizing sensitivity to @xmath7 measured via studies of the rates of @xmath30 decays .",
    "meson final states such as @xmath31 , which may arise from either a cabibbo favored @xmath32 decay or a doubly cabibbo suppressed @xmath33 decay , can lead to large interference effects and hence provide particular sensitivity to @xmath7 .",
    "the interference phase , @xmath34 , also relates the @xmath17 mixing parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the differences in the effective branching fraction for @xmath37 decay opposite @xmath29-even and -odd eigenstates , semileptonic decays , and @xmath38 are sensitive to both @xmath34 and to @xmath17 mixing parameters . with @xmath39 of data , cleo - c has measured @xmath34 to be @xmath40 through a quantum correlated analysis of completely reconstructed @xmath41 decays @xcite .",
    "the ads formalism can be extended by considering multi - body decays of the @xmath1 meson . however , a multi - body @xmath1-decay amplitude is potentially different at any point within the decay phase space , because of the contribution of intermediate resonances .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite how the rate equations for the two - body ads method should be modified for use with multi - body final states .",
    "the result is an effective average phase and a `` coherence factor '' which reflects the dilution of total interference relative to the expectation for a simple two - body decay .",
    "cleo - c has measured these for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 decays , observing significant coherence in the former @xcite .",
    "dalitz plot analyses of the three - body decay @xmath46 together with studies of @xmath47 processes currently provide the best measurements of the ckm weak phase @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath46 dalitz plot analyses are sensitive to the choice of the model used to describe the three - body decay , which currently introduces a model systematic uncertainty on the determination of @xmath7 which is greater than @xmath48 @xcite . for lhcb and future super-@xmath13 factories , this uncertainty will become a major limitation .",
    "a model independent approach to understanding the @xmath1 decay has been proposed by giri and further investigated by bondar @xcite , which takes advantage of the quantum correlated @xmath49 cleo - c data produced at the @xmath12 resonance .",
    "cleo - c has performed this measurement for the @xmath44 decay @xcite and for the @xmath45 mode @xcite which may also be used in this method .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the effect of the @xmath29 correlations on the @xmath50 dalitz plot . up to small effects",
    "@xmath51 has a @xmath29 structure opposite that of @xmath52 , and similarly for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath50 analysis is expected to reduce the current 7 - 9@xmath55 model uncertainties from babar and belle measurements @xcite to around @xmath56 @xcite at lhcb .",
    "the @xmath37 and multi - body coherence factor measurements are projected to improve the precision of lhcb in @xmath57 by 8 - 35% ( depending on unknown @xmath13 decay parameters ) to 2.2 - 3.5@xmath55 after @xmath58 of lhcb data taking @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath59 of pseudoscalar @xmath60 involves a hadronic current ( parametrized by the single `` decay constant '' @xmath61 ) and a well - understood standard model leptonic current .",
    "the branching fraction can be written as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the relevant element of the ckm matrix connecting the valence quarks of @xmath60 ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath18 and @xmath66 , respectively ) .",
    "the decay constant is essentially a measure of the wave function of the meson at zero separation between the quarks .",
    "this makes the decay constant relevant for processes where the relevant length scales are much smaller than the hadron size , including the loop diagrams for @xmath67 and @xmath68 mixing ( our primary source of information on @xmath69 ) .",
    "we can determine @xmath70 by measuring the branching fraction of @xmath60 .",
    "thus either the decay constant or the ckm element can be determined if we know the other quantity .",
    "cleo - c has measured the @xmath18 and @xmath66 decay constants in multiple decay modes .",
    "the results of all cleo - c leptonic branching fraction measurements and the corresponding decay constants are shown in table [ table:1a ] .",
    "the values of input parameters used to obtain these values are listed in the corresponding papers @xcite .",
    "exclusive semileptonic decays are more difficult to parameterize than leptonic decays since there more than two particles in the final state .",
    "the partial width for the decay @xmath71 , where @xmath60 and @xmath72 are pseudoscalars , can be written as : @xmath73 ^ 2p^3_x~~\\ ] ] in the limit where the charged lepton mass is negligible . in equation",
    "[ eqsl ] , @xmath74 is the invariant mass squared of the @xmath75 system , @xmath76 is the relevant ckm matrix element for the weak transition , and @xmath77 is a form factor which represents the hadronic physics interactions . as in the leptonic decay case ,",
    "input for either @xmath76 or @xmath78 allows determination of the other .",
    "we analyze @xmath79 decays @xcite in order to determine the form factors in bins of @xmath74 .",
    "reasonable agreement on the form factor shape and normalization is found with a lattice qcd prediction from the fnal , milc , and hpqcd collaborations @xcite .",
    "a comparison of our results to the theory can be seen in figure [ fig2 ] . using lattice predictions for @xmath80 ,",
    "values for @xmath81 and @xmath82 are also obtained , which are limited by lattice uncertainties .",
