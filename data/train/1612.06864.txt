    "<S> we investigate whether the spin or charge degrees of freedom are responsible for the nodal gap in underdoped cuprates by performing inelastic neutron scattering and x - ray diffraction measurements on la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , which is on the edge of the antiferromagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> we found that fluctuating incommensurate spin - density - wave ( sdw ) with a the bottom part of an hourglass dispersion exists even in this magnetic sample . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest component of these fluctuations diminishes at the same temperature where the nodal gap opens . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray scattering measurements on the same crystal show no signature of charge - density - wave ( cdw ) . therefore , we suggest that the nodal gap in the electronic band of this cuprate opens due to fluctuating sdw with no contribution from cdw .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several indications by now from angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) that in underdoped cuprates a gap opens at the fermi surface in the diagonal ( nodal ) direction  @xcite . in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) this nodal gap ( ng ) extends to @xmath3 . at doping around @xmath4 samples </S>",
    "<S> develop a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) below @xmath5  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> traces of antiferromagnetism ( afm ) in the form of spin - density - waves ( sdw ) @xcite or spin - glass @xcite appear at doping up to @xmath4 and temperatures @xmath6  k. it is therefore natural to speculate that one of these symmetry breaking phenomena is responsible for the opening of a nodal gap . </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we would like to clarify which one is the most likely . </S>",
    "<S> our strategy is to carefully examine a sample which is known to at least have both afm and sdw order , and opens a nodal gap at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is lsco with @xmath7  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> previous neutron diffraction measurements on lsco @xmath7 @xcite showed a magnetic bragg peak at the afm wave vector @xmath8 below @xmath9  k , and two satellites that stand for static sdw order ( on top of the afm one ) . </S>",
    "<S> the satellites appear below @xmath10  k. like in matsuda et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there are two domains in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on one of them , in which the afm peak is observed when scanning near ( 1,0,0 ) , with no contribution from sdw . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the sdw peaks are observed when scanning near ( 0,1,0 ) , with no contribution from the afm peak . </S>",
    "<S> neutron scattering detects the component of spin fluctuations perpendicular to the momentum transfer @xmath11  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the sdw fluctuations are perpendicular to the afm order . </S>",
    "<S> arpes measurements on the same sample found that a nodal gap opens below @xmath12  k  @xcite . even though there is a temperature mismatch between the ng and sdw appearance , </S>",
    "<S> the two phenomena might be related . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , cdw in lsco @xmath7 is expected to be very weak @xcite , and indeed this sample is out of the cdw dome  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , _ a priori _ , cdw is not expected to generate the nodal gap .    here </S>",
    "<S> we add to the available arpes and neutron diffraction data , inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) and x - ray diffraction data on the same piece of lsco @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the fluctuating sdw amplitude of the frequency where it is the strongest , decreases at a temperature equal to @xmath13 within experimental error . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we could not find any indications for cdw in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these findings explain the previously measured @xmath14  k discrepancy between the sdw freezing and the opening of a ng , and tie the latter to fluctuating sdw .    </S>",
    "<S> the neutron experiment was performed at rita - ii , the cold neutrons triple axis spectrometer at the paul scherrer institut . throughout this paper , we work in orthorhombic notation , with cell parameters @xmath15   , @xmath16     and @xmath17     at @xmath18  k. in this notation , the tetragonal 2d @xmath19 is equivalent to @xmath20 in reciprocal lattice units ( r.l.u ) of @xmath21 . </S>",

    "<S> this is due to high order contamination of the incoming beam scattering from a nuclear bragg peak at @xmath27 , despite the use of br filter . </S>",
    "<S> around @xmath28 , the intensity extends to energy transfers as high as 8 mev for both temperatures , in a cone shape , which is in fact a poorly - resolved bottom part of an hourglass . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , for the lsco samples there is no difference between the signal at high and low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath67 of the cdw peak depends on doping , in our sample it is expected to be close to @xmath68 , where a tail of the bragg peak could potentially obscure the cdw peak . </S>",
    "<S> arrows in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> these positions are out of the @xmath68 peak tail , and not obscured . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although we are in experimental conditions appropriate to find a cdw , it is not observed within our sensitivity . in fact , cdw is even absent at higher doping as demonstrated by our experiment with lsco @xmath69 sample . </S>",
    "<S> we observed the same null - result with the rexs experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to mention that hourglass excitations with no stripe - like cdw were observed previously @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our main results are as follows : we find the bottom part of an hourglass dispersion inside the afm phase of lsco . </S>",
    "<S> the hourglass does not start from zero energy , but has a soft gap from the static sdw order . </S>",
    "<S> a cdw order seems to be absent in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> upon cooling the system , a nodal gap in electronic excitations opens just when the strongest spin excitations start to diminish . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore sufficient for the sdw fluctuations to slow down without completely freezing out in order to modify the band structure .     and @xmath69 , and lbco @xmath4 . </S>",
