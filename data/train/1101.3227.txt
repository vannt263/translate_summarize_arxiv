    "the relation between internal fluctuations in a system on the one hand and its susceptibility under an applied external field on the other hand is of great practical and theoretical interest .",
    "the most immediate example concerns the relation between diffusion and mobility and remains important in the development of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the first studies go back to the works of @xcite and of @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they are early examples of the fluctuation  dissipation theorem , itself being a cornerstone of linear response theory for equilibrium systems , see @xcite and @xcite . + when moving to nonequilibrium systems , the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation relation ( fdr ) is typically violated and there is no _ a priori _ reason why the system s mobility can be simply obtained from its diffusivity . all the same , mobility remains crucially important for the discussion of transport properties under nonequilibrium conditions @xcite .",
    "that is why we want to get explicit information about the corrections to the fdr , a subject that has been considered from many different sides .",
    "we mention few .",
    "one approach has been to associate an effective temperature to the nonequilibrium system , for example in ageing regimes , as e.g. in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another approach is to modify the fdr inserting the nonequilibrium stationary density , or going to a `` moving '' frame of reference using the probability current or local velocity @xcite , somewhat in the spirit of the approach of @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "specific models of interacting particles have for example been treated , also in mathematically rigorous ways , by @xcite .",
    "more recent experimental work includes @xcite .",
    "+ here we concentrate on the nonequilibrium regime where the sutherland ",
    "einstein relation gets modified because of nonconservative forces , starting from the inertial regime .",
    "as will become clear , not much effort is needed for finding examples where these corrections are visible and detectable .",
    "recent work by @xcite is similar to ours but in a different setting .",
    "the present paper gives the corrections following recent work by @xcite , which enables us to zoom in on particular dependencies , such as on environment and driving parameters .",
    "+ the main results of the present analysis are the explicit relations ( [ genresult2 ] ) and ( [ symr ] ) between the mobility and the diffusion constant , and their numerical exploration .",
    "in particular , we typically find that for the models treated here the diffusion constant depends on the external ( nonequilibrium ) forcing in a stronger way than the mobility .",
    "the mobility is bounded from above by the diffusion , as we derive in an exact bound ( [ bou ] ) .",
    "when the forcing only depends on the position , then the correction to the sutherland ",
    "einstein relation is second order .",
    "+ the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ modein ] contains the general relation between mobility and diffusion matrix for langevin dynamics in a magnetic field plus other general external forces .",
    "the correction to the sutherland ",
    "einstein relation is in terms of a correlation function between the particle velocity and the applied forces . as simplest and standard illustration section [ clas ] reminds us of the theoretical framework of the sutherland ",
    "einstein relation .",
    "it is the famous proportionality of the mobility ( in linear regime ) with the diffusion constant ( of the original system ) .",
    "we see from these textbook examples that our approach is suitable . then restarts the nonequilibrium analysis .",
    "section [ uni ] treats nonequilibrium fluids with uniform temperature .",
    "the nonequilibrium condition is imposed by stirring the fluid ( rotational or nonconservative forces ) . here",
    "our motivation is primarily to illustrate the existing exact formul and to explore more the role and the influence of the various parameters .",
    "all involved observables can be measured under the nonequilibrium averaging , and vice versa , the formul in principle enable to learn about unknown driving forces and parameters from the correction to the sutherland ",
    "einstein relation .",
    "section [ app2 ] explores the symmetrized mobility ; the diagonal elements allow some general bound .",
    "finally , the appendix contains some more technical points dealing with analysis and numerics .",
    "consider a particle of mass @xmath0 , which diffuses in a heat bath ( e.g. some fluid ) in @xmath1 according to the langevin dynamics @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the position of the particle at time @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is its velocity .",
    "the particle is passive and undergoes the influence of a heat bath in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath6 . in the usual weak coupling regime",
    "the particle suffers friction with coefficient @xmath7 and random collisions , here represented by the vector @xmath8 of standard gaussian white noises .",
    "this means that each of the components has a gaussian distribution , with mean zero @xmath9 and covariance @xmath10 . throughout this text we set boltzmann s constant to one .",
    "furthermore there is an external force @xmath11 working on the particle . throughout this text ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to forces that depend periodically on the position @xmath12 .",
    "we make this restriction to have a form of translation invariance in the system . in other words ,",
    "we consider time - scales over which there is no confining potential .",
    "the force @xmath11 can depend on the velocity as for a magnetic field when the particle is charged .",
    "+ when given an initial ( probability ) density @xmath13 of independent such particles at time zero , it changes in time according to the fokker - planck equation @xmath14\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are two important quantities that characterize the transport behavior of such a system .",
    "the first quantity is the diffusion ( matrix ) function @xmath15 , which is defined as @xmath16 the subscripts denote the components of the corresponding vectors , and the right - hand side is a truncated correlation function : for observables @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 for diffusive systems , i.e. , for the systems described above , this diffusion function is expected to have a large time limit , called the diffusion matrix @xmath20 in words , the ( co)variance of the displacement of the particle is linear with time ( for large times @xmath21 ) with slope given by the diffusion constant . some analysis is found in appendix [ app1 ] .",
    "secondly , there is the mobility ( matrix ) function @xmath22 , defined as follows : we add to the dynamics in ( [ general ] ) a constant ( but small ) force @xmath23 , replacing @xmath24 .",
    "the mobility then measures the change in the expected displacement of the particle : @xmath25 where the superscript @xmath26 wants the average to be taken in the dynamics with the extra force @xmath23 . again , this function is supposed to have a large - time limit , which is called the mobility : @xmath27 i.e. , the mobility is the linear change in the stationary velocity by the addition of a small constant force .    in the special case of detailed balance dynamics ,",
    "these two quantities are related by the sutherland ",
    "einstein relation , @xmath28 which is an instance of the more general fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "+ when the system is not in equilibrium , mobility and diffusion constants are no longer proportional .",
    "additional terms show up : for the dynamics defined in ( [ general ] ) we get @xmath29 where the vector @xmath30 is explicitly given by @xmath31 the relation between the mobility and diffusion functions is thus modified with respect to the large time limits in equilibrium systems by the addition of an extra term .",
    "this term is the ( truncated ) correlation function between the displacement and the functional @xmath30 .",
    "this functional is explicitly expressed in terms of the velocity of the particle of interest and the forces that act on it . in the limit of large times , the relation ( [ genresult1 ] ) simplifies somewhat : in this limit we get @xmath32 where the vector @xmath33 is explicitly given by @xmath34 indeed , the term with the correlation between the displacement and the change of velocity does not contribute in the large - time limit : @xmath35 for an argument see appendix [ app1 ] . in section [ app2 ] we further rewrite ( [ genresult2 ] ) to obtain @xmath36 where each term represents a symmetric matrix . under conservative forces the second and the third term sum to give the first term on the right - hand side . otherwise , in diffusive nonequilibrium the correction term to the sutherland ",
    "einstein relation is nonzero with the symmetrized mobility matrix as the explicit difference between a diffusion  related matrix and the force - force covariance matrix , as claimed in the last line of the abstract .",
    "a further bound on the symmetrized mobility is added in section [ app2 ] .",
    "+ our modified sutherland ",
    "einstein relation has the advantage of being explicit in the dynamical variables .",
    "still the formula is sufficiently complicated and some aspects of it require careful examination . we can rewrite formula ( [ genresult2 ] ) into @xmath37 as we see , the correction to the equilibrium mobility  diffusion relation is measured by a space  time correlation between applied forcing and displacement .",
    "one simplification is to look close - to - equilibrium .",
    "there we see by time - reversal symmetry applied to the reference equilibrium that the correction is only quadratic in the applied forcing when @xmath11 only depends on @xmath12 . in other words ,",
    "the deviations with respect to the sutherland - einstein relation are then second order .",
    "going further from equilibrium also the inverse question becomes interesting , to characterize the nonequiilibrium forcing that produces a given experimentally determined mobility - diffusion relation .",
    "we hope to see in future work that formul like are also useful to learn about the driving conditions from measurements of both mobility and diffusion .",
    "numerically , of course the right - hand side of is easier to determine than the left - hand side .",
    "+ usually , as also in what follows , one considers the diffusion and the mobility of a single particle .",
    "it is however relevant and also possible to include interactions with other particles .",
    "the equations ( [ general ] ) must be changed for the force to include this dependence on the state of the other particles , but the main results remain unaffected .",
    "after all , one can simply redo all calculations in larger dimensions ( @xmath38 for @xmath39 particles ) and consider independent white noises acting on all 3n - components .",
    "furthermore , the force @xmath40 can be time - dependent and formulae ( [ genresult2 ] )  ( [ symr ] ) remain the same but where @xmath40 has further time - dependencies , be it explicit or be it because of the time - dependent state of other particles .",
    "+ the explicit relations above have been derived in @xcite following a path - integral formalism . in the present paper",
    "we provide a number of examples to discuss this relation between mobility and diffusion out of equilibrium . for each of these examples ,",
    "simulations have been done to help visualization , and to inform us about the relative importance of the various parameters and terms in ( [ genresult2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the simulations raise new questions , not all of which we are able to answer",

    "* pure diffusion * + the simplest form of the langevin equation is the case where all the external forces are set to zero @xmath41 the mobility and diffusion can be computed explicitly , by first integrating the langevin equation ( adding a force @xmath23 ) , @xmath42 + \\int_0^tdse^{-\\gamma(t - s)}\\vec{\\xi}_s\\ ] ] and then using the properties of the gaussian white noise . because @xmath43 , we immediately get the mobility by again integrating over time , @xmath44\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath45 the velocity - velocity correlations equal ( for @xmath46 ) @xmath47e^{-\\gamma(t+s ) } +   \\frac{\\delta_{i , j}t}{m}e^{-\\gamma |t - s|}\\ ] ] simply integrating over time then gives the diffusion , @xmath48\\big[1-e^{-\\gamma t}\\big]^2 + \\delta_{ij}t\\big[\\frac{1}{\\gamma m } - \\frac{1-e^{-\\gamma t}}{\\gamma^2 mt}\\big ]   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking the limit of large times , we see that @xmath49    * a periodic potential * + when a force is added that derives from a periodic potential @xmath50 , @xmath51 then , the general expression ( [ genresult1 ] ) gives @xmath52 the second term on the right - hand side tends to zero for large times , as said before , as does the third term : @xmath53 yielding the standard @xmath54 ; see also appendix [ app1 ] .",
    "of course the mobility and diffusion are no longer equal to @xmath55 .",
    "we get a summary in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffpot ] . observe for example that the mobility decreases with the amplitude of the conservative force , which is logical , since the particle needs to escape potential wells to have a non - zero velocity .",
    "+ in fact , in @xcite an explicit expression was derived for the diffusion for overdamped langevin equations with periodic potentials .",
    "the overdamped langevin equation is what one gets when the friction is high and the mass of the particle is small , so that inertial effects can be ignored .",

    "we can then insert the exponential bounds : @xmath153\\nonumber\\\\ & \\leq & \\left [ \\big<|f(s)|\\big>_\\rho + c'\\sqrt{\\left < f^2\\right>_{\\rho}}e^{-\\alpha ' s } \\right]c\\sqrt{\\big",

    "equilibrium is characterized by time - reversal invariance .",
    "this means in particular that the expectation value of a time - antisymmetric quantity is zero in equilibrium . in our case",
    ", this means that @xmath157 the rest of the proof of ( [ corrpotzero ] ) is quite straightforward .",
    "we give a short proof of formula .",
    "consider the stationary probability current @xmath158 for one - dimensional overdamped diffusion on the circle in the presence of a constant force @xmath26 : @xmath159\\rho - \\chi\\,t\\,\\rho'\\ ] ] where @xmath156 is the stationary distribution .",
    "because of stationarity , the current does not depend on the spatial coordinate @xmath122 .",
    "we divide the last equation by @xmath156 and integrate over the circle : @xmath160 up to first order in @xmath26 , the stationary current is thus given by @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the equilibrium distribution .",
    "this gives the mobility @xmath163 because @xmath164",
    "all graphs in this paper are the result of simulations made with the programming language c++ by directly applying the langevin equation .",
    "this means ( taking the simple example of one dimension ) taking variables @xmath122 and @xmath165 which at each timestep of length @xmath166 change by the operations @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a random number drawn with a standard normal distribution ( mean zero and variance 1 ) . in this way a trajectory of consecutive positions and velocities is generated . in the same way trajectories are generated for a dynamics where a small constant force is added .",
    "the relevant quantities ( diffusion , integrated forces , displacement of the particle ) are then computed at each timestep by averaging over many simulated trajectories .",
    "the size of the timestep , of the force , and the number of simulated trajectories varied between the different examples in this text to find each time a good compromise between statistical accuracy and computation time .",
    "the length of the trajectories was taken such that the quantities showed a clear convergence to a constant value .",
    "as an example , for the case of the nonperiodic potential , we took @xmath169 , @xmath170 , the number of timesteps @xmath171 and the number of trajectories @xmath172 .",
    "as the goal of this paper is not providing accurate quantitative information , but rather a qualitative visualization of the relation between mobility and diffusion , we did not compute the statistical and systematical errors .",
    "rather , we check each time that the mobility equals the sum of the terms on the right - hand side of ( [ genresult1 ] ) .",
    "the mobility needs much more computation time ( number of simulated trajectories ) than the other quantities .",
    "the problem there is that one subtracts two quantities that are close to each other , and then divides by a small number .",
    "furthermore , for the mobility one needs to simulate two systems : the perturbed and the unperturbed one .",
    "this also means that our results are numerically useful , as one does not need to compute the mobility separately .",
    "we used this fact in the simulations where the force was varied , as in figures [ fig : withforcebis ] , [ fig : withforcefreq ] , [ fig : forcerotorf ] .",
    "the simulations there took a longer time , as each different value of the force required a different simulation . by leaving out the mobility ,",
    "the number of trajectories could however be reduced ( e.g. for the nonperiodic force the number was @xmath173 ) .",
