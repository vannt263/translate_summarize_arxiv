    "reference [ [ mb7 ] ] is a presentation entitled _ relativistic nuclear many - body theory _ given at the seventh international conference on recent progress in many - body theories held in minneapolis , minnesota , in august , 1991 .",
    "this was a report on a long - term effort to understand the nuclear many - body system in terms of relativistic quantum field theories based on hadronic degrees of freedom @xcite , a topic we refer to as _ quantum hadrodynamics _ ( or qhd ) .",
    "an extensive , more recent review of work in this area is contained in ref .  [ [ ijmpe ] ] , and a text now exists @xcite that provides background material . ] through [ [ jdw ] ] .",
    "] there has been significant recent progress in this area @xcite , and the goal of this contribution is to summarize briefly what has transpired since the presentation in ref .",
    "[ [ mb7 ] ] .",
    "the only consistent framework we have for discussing the relativistic many - body system is relativistic quantum field theory based on a local lagrangian density . in any lagrangian approach , one must first decide on the generalized coordinates , and hadronic degrees of freedom  baryons and mesons  are the most appropriate for ordinary nuclear systems ( qhd ) .",
    "early attempts involved simple renormalizable models , which reproduced some basic features of the nuclear interaction @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such models is that in principle , one can consistently investigate and relate all aspects of nuclear structure to a small number of renormalized coupling constants and masses .",
    "the disadvantage , in addition to the strong coupling constants that make reliable approximation schemes difficult to come by , is that limiting the discussion to renormalizable lagrangians is too restrictive . despite these drawbacks ,",
    "the simple models led to interesting insights . in relativistic mean - field theory ( mft ) ,",
    "nuclear densities , the level structure of the nuclear shell model , and the spin dependence of nucleon  nucleus scattering are reproduced @xcite .",
    "the simplest model ( qhd  i ) consists of baryons and isoscalar scalar and vector mesons .",
    "a basic feature of all these models is that there are strong scalar and vector mean fields present in the nucleus , which cancel in the binding energy but which add to give the large spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "there is now overwhelming evidence that the underlying theory of the strong interaction is _ quantum chromodynamics _ ( qcd ) , a yang ",
    "mills non - abelian gauge theory built on an internal color symmetry of a system of quarks and gluons .",
    "if mass terms for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks are absent in the lagrangian , qcd possesses _ chiral symmetry _ in the nuclear domain ; although spontaneously broken in manifestation , this symmetry should play an essential role in nuclear dynamics .",
    "the challenge @xcite was to understand the theoretical basis of qhd , the successes that it had , and its limitations , in terms of qcd .",
    "indeed , as we say in our summary in ref .",

    "all possible couplings must be included in the low - energy effective lagrangian , which is then to be used at tree level .",

    "i results .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the relation to density functional theory @xcite and kohn ",
    "sham potentials @xcite .",
    "section 3 contains a brief presentation of the effective lagrangian , and section 4 summarizes some recent results .",
    "we begin with a discussion of nonrelativistic density functional theory ( dft ) and generalize later to include relativity . the basic idea behind dft",
    "is to compute the energy @xmath4 of the many - fermion system ( or , at finite temperature , the grand potential @xmath5 ) as a functional of the particle density .",
    "dft is therefore a successor to thomas  fermi theory , which uses a crude energy functional , but eliminates the need to calculate the many - fermion wave function .",
    "the strategy behind dft can be seen most easily by working in analogy to thermodynamics @xcite .  for a uniform system in a box of volume @xmath6 at temperature @xmath7 ,",
    "one first computes the grand potential @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the chemical potential .",
    "it then follows that the number of particles @xmath10 is determined by @xmath11 the convexity of @xmath5 implies that @xmath10 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath9 , so this relation can be inverted for @xmath12 .",
    "finally , one makes a legendre transformation to the helmholtz free energy @xmath13 to discuss systems with a fixed density @xmath14 .    for a finite system ,",
    "we replace the chemical potential with an external , single - particle potential into the definition of @xmath15 .",
    "we suppress all spin dependence at this point . ]",
    "the grand potential is now a _",
    "functional _ :",
    "@xmath17 , t)$ ] , and a functional derivative with respect to @xmath15 gives the particle density : @xmath18 the convexity of @xmath5 allows us ( in principle ) to invert this relation and find @xmath19 as a ( complicated ) functional of @xmath20 .",
    "finally , we make a functional legendre transformation to define the hohenberg  kohn free energy , which is a functional of @xmath20 : @xmath21 = \\omega [ v({\\mathbf r } ) ]      - \\int { \\mathrm d}{\\mathbf r } \\",
    "n({\\mathbf r } ) v({\\mathbf r } ) \\ .\\ ] ] ( @xmath7 is suppressed . ) the variational derivative of this free energy functional with respect to @xmath22 now gives @xmath23 if we now restrict consideration to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , then the _ hohenberg  kohn theorem _ follows @xcite :  if the functional form of @xmath26 $ ] is known exactly , the ground - state expectation value of any observable is a _",
    "unique _ functional of the exact ground - state density .",
    "moreover , it follows immediately from eq .",
    "( [ eq : varf ] ) that the exact ground - state density can be found by minimizing the energy functional .",
    "although we have assumed here that the ground state is non - degenerate , this assumption can be easily relaxed @xcite .",
    "the generalization of dft to relativistic systems is straightforward @xcite .",
    "the energy functional @xmath27 now becomes a functional of _ both _ scalar and vector densities ( or more precisely , vector four - currents ) .",
    "extremization of the functional gives rise to variational equations that determine the ground - state densities .",
    "significant progress in solving these equations was made by kohn and sham @xcite , who introduced a complete set of single - particle wave functions . in our case , these wave functions allow us to recast the variational equations as dirac equations for occupied orbitals .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian contains _ local _ , density - dependent , scalar and vector potentials , even when the exact energy functional is used .",
    "moreover , one can introduce auxiliary ( scalar and vector ) fields corresponding to the local potentials , so that the resulting equations resemble those in a relativistic mft calculation @xcite .",
    "the strength of the approach rests on the following theorem :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the exact ground - state scalar and vector densities , energy , and chemical potential for the fully interacting many - fermion system can be reproduced by a collection of ( quasi)fermions moving in appropriately defined , self - consistent , local , classical fields . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the proof is straightforward @xcite .",
    "start with a collection of noninteracting fermions moving in an externally specified , local , one - body potential .",
    "the exact ground state for this system is known : just calculate the lowest - energy orbitals and fill them up .",
    "therefore , if one can find a suitable local , one - body potential based on an _ exact _ energy functional , the exact ground state of that system can be determined . but",
    "this potential is precisely what one obtains by differentiating the interaction parts of @xmath27 with respect to @xmath20 @xcite",
    ". the resulting one - body potential will generally be density dependent and thus must be determined self - consistently .",
    "several points are noteworthy .",
    "as noted by kohn @xcite , the single - particle basis constructed as described above can be considered `` density optimal '' , in contrast to the hartree ( or hartree  fock ) basis , which is `` total - energy optimal '' .",
    "thus the _ exact _ scalar and vector densities are given by sums over the squares of the dirac wave functions , with unit occupation probability .",
    "moreover , since these densities are guaranteed to make the energy functional stationary [ the external @xmath28 , the exact ground - state energy is also obtained . the proof that the eigenvalue of the least - bound state is exactly the fermi energy is given in ref .",
    "[ [ ef ] ] .",
    "note , however , that aside from this association , the exact kohn  sham wave functions ( and remaining eigenvalues ) have no known , directly observable meaning .",
    "if one knows the exact functional form of the energy on the density , one can describe the observables noted in the theorem exactly ( and easily ) in terms of the kohn  sham basis .",
    "observables of this type are typically the ones calculated in relativistic mft .",
    "moreover , it has been known for many years @xcite that the mean - field contributions dominate the single - particle potentials at ordinary densities .",
    "thus , by _ parametrizing _ the energy functional in a mean - field ( or `` factorized '' ) form , and by fitting the parameters to empirical bulk and single - particle nuclear data , one should obtain an excellent approximation to the exact energy functional in the relevant density regime .",
    "this is the key to the success of relativistic mft calculations , as we will verify below , using the effective lagrangian constructed in the next section .",
    "we can not give a detailed derivation and discussion of the effective lagrangian of qhd in this short article , but we can illustrate the basic principles . to exhibit how spontaneously broken chiral symmetry",
    "is incorporated quite generally into the hadronic theory , consider the linear @xmath29-model with an additional linear coupling of an isoscalar @xmath30 to the baryon current , the so - called `` chiral @xmath31 model '' @xcite . define right- and left - handed nucleon fields by @xmath32 and the @xmath33 matrix @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the isovector pion field . if @xmath36 is the nucleon mass , determined by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , and @xmath37 , then the lagrangian for the chiral @xmath31 model can be written as the @xmath38 limit of the following generalized lagrangian @xcite @xmath39                                                      \\nonumber   \\\\   & &   -g_{\\pi } s_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma}{s_0 } \\right )          \\left[\\,{\\overline\\psi}_r \\uu^{\\dagger } \\psi_l +                { \\overline\\psi}_l \\uu \\psi_r \\right ] + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial_{\\mu } \\sigma   \\partial^{\\mu } \\sigma ) + \\frac{1}{4 } s_0",

    "this `` naive '' dimensionless analysis ( nda ) then implies that , after appropriate combinatorial factors are included , the various terms in the effective lagrangian enter with dimensionless coefficients of order unity .",

    "a combination of these observations allows one to construct a hierarchy of decreasing contributions to the effective lagrangian for the nuclear many - body system characterized by an integer @xmath67 defined by @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath3 is the number of derivatives , @xmath22 is the number of nucleon fields , and @xmath69 is the number of non - goldstone boson fields present in the interaction term .",

    "the effective lagrangian with mean meson fields then determines the energy functional of the previous section , and a representation in terms of dirac  hartree orbitals leads to local , nonlinear hartree equations , which can be solved numerically .",
