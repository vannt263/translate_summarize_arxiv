    "understanding and searching for mechanisms that can generate and sustain cooperation among selfish individuals remains to be an interesting problem .",

    "previous theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies showed that , for evolutionary game dynamics in spatially extended systems , punishment is an effective approach to enforcing the cooperative behavior , where the punishment can be imposed on either cooperators or defectors .",
    "the agents that get punished bear a fine while the punisher pays for the cost of imposing the punishment  @xcite . in existing studies , individuals who hold a specific strategy ( usually defection ) are punished .    in realistic situations",
    ", punishment can be mutual and the strategy would typically depends on the surrounding environment , e.g. , on neighbors strategies .",
    "an example is `` peer pressure . ''",
    "previous psychological experiments demonstrated that , an individual tends to conglomerate ( fit in ) with others in terms of behaviors or opinions  @xcite .",
    "dissent often leads to punishment either psychologically or financially , or both , as human individuals attempt to attain social conformity modulated by peer pressure  @xcite . to understand _ quantitatively _ the effect of peer pressure on cooperation through developing and analyzing an evolutionary game model is the main goal of this paper .",
    "in particular , we propose a mechanism of punishment in which an individual will punish neighbors who hold the opposite strategy , regardless of whether they are cooperators or defectors .",
    "differing from previous models where additional strategies of punishment were introduced , in our model there are only two strategies ( pure cooperators and pure defectors ) .",
    "more importantly , the punishment is mutual in our model , i.e. , individual @xmath0 who punishes individual @xmath1 is also punished by @xmath1 , so the cost of punishment can be absorbed into the punishment fine .",
    "because of this symmetry at the individual or `` microscopic '' level , intuitively one may expect the punishment not to have any effect on cooperation .",
    "surprisingly , we find that symmetric punishment can lead to enhancement of cooperation .",
    "we provide computational and heuristic arguments to establish this finding .",
    "without loss of generality , we use and modify the classic prisoner s dilemma game ( pdg )  @xcite to construct a model to gain quantitative understanding of the effect of peer pressure on cooperation by incorporating our symmetric punishment mechanism . in the original pdg , two players simultaneously decide whether to cooperate or defect .",
    "they both receive payoff @xmath2 upon mutual cooperation and payoff @xmath3 upon mutual defection . if one cooperates but the other defects , the defector gets payoff @xmath4 while the cooperator gains payoff @xmath5 .",
    "the payoff rank for the pdg is @xmath6 . as a result ,",
    "in a single round of pdg , mutual defection is the best strategy for both players , generating the well - known social dilemma .",
    "there are different settings of payoff parameters  @xcite . for computational convenience  @xcite , the parameters are often rescaled as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the temptation to defect .    in their pioneering work ,",
    "nowak and may included spatial structure into the pdg  @xcite , in which individuals play games only with their immediate neighbors . in the spatial pdg",
    ", cooperators can survive by forming clusters in which mutual cooperation outweigh the loss against defectors  @xcite . in the past decade , the pdg has been extensively studied for populations on various types of network configurations  @xcite , including regular lattices  @xcite , small - world networks  @xcite , scale - free networks  @xcite , dynamic networks  @xcite , and interdependent networks  @xcite .",

    "an individual will punish the neighbors that hold different strategies .",

    "the update of strategies is based on the replicator equation  @xcite for well - mixed populations and the fermi rule  @xcite for structured populations .",
    "in the case of well - mixed populations , i.e. , a population with no structure , where each individual plays with every other , the evolutionary dynamics is determined by the replication equation of the fraction of the cooperators @xmath20 in the population  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the rescaled payoff of a cooperator and @xmath23 is the rescaled payoff of a defector .",
