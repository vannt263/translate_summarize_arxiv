    "when two galaxies merge , the central bhs sink toward the center of the merger remnant and form a binary system ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 , henceforth bbr ) . whether or not this binary bh can merge in the timescale shorter than the hubble time is an important question for the understanding of the evolution and growth of bhs and galactic nuclei .",
    "bbr predicted that the hardening of the bh binary through the stellar dynamical interaction with field stars ( fss ) would slow down after the loss cone is depleted .",
    "after the depletion , the growth will be driven by the refilling of the loss cone by two - body relaxation , and a simple theoretical estimate results in the merger timescale orders of magnitude larger than the hubble time .",
    "whether or not this slowing down of evolution actually occur has been studied with @xmath0-body simulations @xcite , until very recently , however , there has been serious discrepancy between theory and simulation results , and also among simulation results .",
    "theory predicts that the timescale must be proportional to the number of particles used to express the parent galaxy , since the relaxation timescale is ( neglecting the weak @xmath1 term ) proportional to the number of particles in the system @xmath0 .",
    "the results of @xmath0-body simulations range from no dependence on @xmath0 @xcite to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed @xmath0-body simulations with much larger number of particles ( up to @xmath3 ) and for longer time compared to previous works , and concluded that the @xmath0-dependence of the evolution timescale of bh binary is consistent with the theoretical prediction .",
    "@xcite obtained similar result , by performing even longer simulations for somewhat smaller @xmath0 ( up to 256k ) .",
    "thus , as far as the stellar dynamical effects are concerned , bh binary , once depleted the loss cone , would not merge within the hubble time , unless there remain lots of gas in the central region of merger remnants .",
    "if bhs in galaxies , in particular giant ellipticals , are mostly binaries , growth of the bh through merging might be difficult . if one galaxy with binary bh and the other with single bh merge , the central bhs form a triple system , which is generally unstable",
    ". the most likely outcome would be the ejection of at least one bh , preventing the growth of the central bh binary .",
    "in fact , triple interaction of bhs was first considered as an mechanism to eject bhs from the center of a galaxy@xcite .",
    "the timescale for the merging through gw radiation is given by    @xmath4    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the mass of bhs ( assuming equal masses ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the binary .",
    "in the case of a bh with @xmath9 , the orbital separation must become less than 0.1 pc in order for the merging timescale to become shorter than the hubble time , if we assume the average thermalized value of @xmath10 .",
    "since the gravitational wave timescale depends on the eccentricity very strongly , if some mechanism drives the binary bh to high eccentricity the merging timescale might become short .",
    "@xcite argued that the maximum eccentricity a binary bh would experience is much higher than the average value , since a binary bh must undergo around 10 strong single - binary scattering events before ejecting out a single bh .",
    "they concluded , using simple analytic arguments , that the binary bh in a triple bh system would merge , for the case of typical bh of @xmath11 in a typical elliptical galaxy within the hubble time .",
    "another possibility is the change of eccentricity through kozai mechanism@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the evolution of triple bh systems by means of direct @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "our initial model consists of an @xmath0-body realization of a spherical galaxy and three bh particles .",
    "we started with hierarchical configuration in which two bh particles initially form a binary .",
    "the third bh particle is placed at some distance to the binary .",
    "we changed the initial orbit of the third particle , to see its effect on the evolution of the binary .",
    "we incorporated the effect of gw radiation on the relative orbits of bh particles .",
    "we found that if the initial orbits of three bhs are coplanar and if the total angular momentum is small , the binary bh hardens through repeated binary - single bh interactions .",
    "the interaction stops either when one bh is ejected out of the galaxy or when the bh binary merges through gw radiation .",
    "which of the two dominates depends on the depth of the potential well of the parent galaxy .",
    "merging is more likely for deeper potential . for typical giant ellipticals ,",
    "potential is deep enough that merging dominates .",
    "when the orbits are not coplanar , hierarchical triples are formed and the inner binary evolves through kozai mechanism , in a fair fraction of cases .",
    "kozai mechanism leads the large - amplitude oscillation of eccentricity .",
    "thus , merging is more likely in three - dimensional configuration than in coplanar systems .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the initial models and method of our numerical simulation . in section 3 ,",
    "we show the result of the cases in which three black holes are initially in coplanar orbits . in section 4 ,",
    "we show the result of more general cases of non - coplanar initial conditions .",
    "we summarize our result of numerical simulation in section 5 .",
    "the initial setup is schematically shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we placed three bh particles in @xmath0-body models of a spherical galaxy .",
    "the quantitative properties of models and initial conditions of our simulation is summarized in table 1 .    for the galaxy model",
    ", we used a king model with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the nondimensional central potential of king models @xcite .",
    "we performed several runs changing the number of particles in a galaxy from 16k to 128k .",
    "we adopted the the standard @xmath0-body units @xcite , in which @xmath14 . here",
    ", @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the total mass and total binding energy of the galaxy and @xmath17 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the relation to the physical units will be discussed in section 2.5 .",
    "we placed three blackholes in the parent galaxy model .",
    "all blackhole particles have the same mass of 0.01 in the @xmath0-body units .",
    "two blackholes are initially placed as a binary with eccentricity @xmath18 in the center of the galaxy model .",
    "the orbital plane of this binary is the @xmath19 plane .",
    "the third blackhole is placed at position ( 1,0,0 ) .",
    "we have changed the initial velocity of the third particles in several different ways . in the simplest case",
    ", it is placed at rest . in one series",
    ", we gave initial velocity along @xmath20 axis , and in another series along @xmath21 and in the third one in @xmath22 plane .",

    "we integrated the equations of motions using the 4th order hermite scheme @xcite with individual variable time step . in order to apply the hermite scheme ,",
    "we need the time derivative of the acceleration . for the gravitational wave term ( eq . [ eqn : gw ] )",
    ", we used the following form as the time derivative : @xmath67,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath68 where @xmath69 is @xmath51th black hole acceleration .    in order to calculate the acceleration due to field particles , we used grape-6@xcite , the special purpose computer for the gravitational @xmath0-body problem .",
    "forces from bh particles , both newtonian and gravitational wave terms , are calculated on the host computer .    in all runs , the energy ( corrected for the loss of energy through gw radiation)is conserved to 0.1% .",
    "we interpret the mass unit in our simulation as @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the mass of bh particles is @xmath71 .",
    "the total mass of @xmath70 corresponds to the mass of the nucleus of a galaxy containing a bh . in other words ,",
    "the galaxy model we use is not really the model of the entire galaxy , but only that of the central region .",
    "the reason we limit our model to the central region is simply to reduce the number of particles @xmath0 , in other words , to reduce the calculation cost .",
    "this modification means that the potential depth of our model galaxy is somewhat less than that of a real galaxy with the same velocity dispersion . to see the effect of this difference",
    ", we have changed the velocity dispersion of the galaxy and investigated the effect . in the standard",
    "runs , we set the velocity dispersion of the initial king model as 300 km / s .",
    "in other words , we set the light velocity @xmath72 in the @xmath0-body unit to 706 .",
    "we tried two different values of velocity dispersion , 600 km / s and 150 km / s , or the value of the light velocity 353 and 1412 , respectively .",
    "note that by changing the value of @xmath72 actually we change the strength of the gw term in equation ( [ eqn : gw ] ) and thus change the evolution of the bh particles .",
    "in this section , we describe the results of runs in which the third bh is initially at rest , to illustrate the typical behavior and the dependence of the results on the artificial parameters of numerical experiments such as the softening and the number of particles .",
    "we discuss the results of more general configurations in section [ sect : general ] .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the evolution of the semi - major axis @xmath7 and the eccentricity @xmath8 of the bh binary in one run of model 64kw7 ( hereafter called run 64kw7a ) . in this and all other figures ,",
    "the semi - major axis and eccentricity are defined as those of the most strongly bound pair of bh particles .",
    "initially ( for time @xmath73 ) , @xmath7 shows smooth decrease .",
    "this is due to the dynamical friction from field stars .",
    "the jumps in @xmath7 and @xmath8 at @xmath74 is the result of first strong encounter between the binary and the third body . in this case , the binary becomes wider and more eccentric .",
    "the three bh particles experienced quite complex series of interactions until @xmath75 .",
    "at this point , the third bh was ejected out , and it took some time before it came back and interacted strongly with the binary at @xmath76 .",
    "after this interaction , the eccentricity of the binary reached @xmath77 , resulting in the quick orbital decay by gw emission .    in this case , the high eccentricity is realized only after the last strong interaction .",
    "however , there are several other periods when the eccentricity was large , like around @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "high values of eccentricity are not very unusual after strong interaction events .    in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , orbits of three blackholes in run 64kw7a projected on the @xmath19 plane are shown .",
    "the top panel shows the trajectory of two bh particles which are initially in a binary , for the period of @xmath82 .",
    "the third bh particle is out of the plotting region and thus not shown .",
    "initially , the orbits decay quickly . as a result the orbital period becomes shorter and the change in one orbit becomes smaller . in the meantime , the center of mass of the binary moves along the @xmath20 axis , because of the gravitational force from the third bh particle which was initially located at ( 0,1,0 ) and falling down to the center of the galaxy .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] shows the last strong encounter .",
    "the binary bh ( of bhs numbered 1 and 3 ) comes in from the right side , and the third bh ( bh2 ) comes in from the left side .",
    "after the complex encounter , a new binary of bhs 1 and 2 , with the very high eccentricity , flies out to upper - right corner and bh3 to the lower - left corner .",
    "the last column of table [ tbl2 ] shows the fraction of runs in which merger occurred .",
    "the divisor is the total number of runs performed for the model and dividend is the number of runs in which merging occured . for runs of model",
    "64kw7 with velocity dispersion @xmath83 , in three out of five runs the bh binary merged before single bh is kicked out of the parent galaxy . in two other cases ,",
    "a single bh was kicked out . for runs of model 64kw7high ( @xmath84 )",
    ", two out of three resulted in merging .",
    "all of runs of model 64kw7low ( @xmath85 ) resulted in ejection .",
    "the total potential depth of typical giant ellipticals is somewhere between galaxy models 64kw7 and 64kw7high .",
    "thus , we can conclude that a triple bh system , if formed in giant ellipticals , is likely to end up in merging of two of the three bhs , leaving out a binary bh system .",
    "the ejection of one bh is not impossible , though . in the remaining part of this section",
    ", we check the effect of artificial parameters such as the softening and the number of particles .      in figure",
    "[ fig : compareeps ] , we show the evolution of semi - major axis of binaries of two runs with different softening parameters between fs - fs .",
    "solid and dashed curves correspond to runs with @xmath55 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "though the details are different , the overall evolution is similar .",
    "we performed five runs with @xmath87 , and one runs ended up in merging .",
    "this result is consistent with that for @xmath55 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : comparen ] , we show the evolution of semi - major axis of binaries in runs with different number of particles for the parent galaxy .",
    "again , the overall behavior is not much different . for @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    ", we again performed ten and five runs , and four runs each ended up in merging .",
    "we can conclude @xmath0 has little effect on the result .",
    "this result is quite different from that for the evolution of two massive bhs ( one bh binary ) in the central region of the galaxy , where the number of particles , _",
    "i.e. _ , the relaxation timescale , determines the evolution timescale of the bh binary . in the case of two bhs , the loss cone",
    "is soon depleted , and the only way for the field particles to interact with the bh binary is to enter the loss cone through two - body relaxation .",
    "thus , it is quite natural that the evolution timescale depends on @xmath0 .",
    "however , in the case of a triple bh system , three bhs alone determines the evolution , and field particles works just as the background potential and the source for the dynamical friction .",
    "thus , there is nothing like loss - cone depletion .",
    "in addition to models with @xmath90 , we tried three runs with @xmath91 .",
    "as can be seen in table [ tbl2 ] , there is not much difference in the final outcome .",
    "this result looks a bit counter - intuitive , since , as we have seen in section [ sect : statistics ] , the merging probability does depend on the depth of the potential relative to the speed of the light .",
    "the reason why the outcome is not much different in cases with @xmath90 and @xmath92 is that initial binary bh hardens much more quickly in models with @xmath91 than in models with @xmath90 . as a result",
    ", ejection of bh occurs after smaller number of triple interactions and the chance to reach high eccentricity is smaller for higher central density .",
    "this difference more than compensates the deeper potential .",

    "in section [ sect : planar ] , we considered the simplest case in which a binary is at the center of the galaxy and the third bh particle falls from around the half - mass radius .",
    "this is clearly a rather special case , and the result may be biased . in this section",
    "we consider several different configurations .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the result of runs in which the third bh has the initial velocity perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary bh ( runs 64ki90vx , see table [ tbl3 ] ) . the case with @xmath95",
    "is qualitatively similar to the result of free - fall runs ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "orbital elements of the binary shows noncontinuous changes after strong encounters with the third bh .",
    "the time interval for the encounter seems to be longer , due to the larger total angular momentum of the triple bh system .",
    "the case with @xmath96 shows quite different behavior .",
    "the eccentricity shows periodic - like change for @xmath97 , but the semi - major axis does not show much change during the same period .",
    "this behavior is driven by the kozai mechanism . the period and magnitude of the oscillation change in time , because the orbital elements of both the inner and outer binaries changes due to the interaction with other field stars . around @xmath98 , the hierarchical system of three bhs became unstable , and strong three - body interactions followed .    in the case of @xmath99 , the inner binary merged in the first cycle of the kozai cycles .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the results of three runs with different initial inclination of the orbital plane of the third bh . as we ve seen in figure [ fig6 ] , in the extreme case of large @xmath100 perpendicular to the binary orbital plane",
    ", the end result is the merging in the first kozai cycle . in the case of @xmath101 ,",
    "kozai cycle drives oscillations of large amplitude , and semi - major axis shrinks each time when the eccentricity reached the peak . in the case of @xmath102 , bhs neither merge nor escape until @xmath103 .",
    "kozai cycles are also observed .",
    "the maximum eccentricity in one cycle is , however , not high enough to drive the merging of inner binary . in the case of the coplanar orbits , kozai cycle of a small magnitude is observed for @xmath104 to 90 . since the initial orbit is coplanar , there can not be any kozai cycle if three bhs remain exactly in the same orbital plane .",
    "however , since the number of particles is finite , fluctuation in the forces from field particles introduces random changes in the inclination of inner and outer binaries , resulting in the configuration for which the kozai cycle can show up .    to summarize the results of 3d triple cases ,",
    "a hierarchical triple bh system is often formed when the third bh falls in .",
    "in such a triple system , a stable oscillation in eccentricity ( and inclination ) driven by kozai mechanism is often observed . in a fair fraction of the cases",
