    "the seminal paper by gupta and kumar @xcite initiated the study of scaling laws in large ad - hoc wireless networks .",
    "their by - now - familiar model considers @xmath0 nodes randomly located in the unit disk , each of which wants to communicate to a random destination node at a rate @xmath9 bits / second .",
    "they ask what is the maximally achievable scaling of the total throughput @xmath10 with the system size @xmath0 .",
    "they showed that classical multihop architectures with conventional single - user decoding and forwarding of packets can not achieve a scaling better than @xmath11 , and that a scheme that uses only nearest - neighbor communication can achieve a throughput that scales as @xmath12 .",
    "this gap was later closed by franceschetti et al @xcite , who showed using percolation theory that the @xmath13 scaling is indeed achievable .",
    "the gupta - kumar model makes certain assumptions on the physical - layer communication technology .",
    "in particular , it assumes that the signals received from nodes other than one particular transmitter are interference to be regarded as noise degrading the communication link . given this assumption , direct communication between source and destination pairs",
    "is not preferable , as the interference generated would preclude most of the other nodes from communicating . instead , the optimal strategy is to confine to nearest neighbor communication and maximize the number of simultaneous transmissions ( spatial reuse ) .",
    "however , this means that each packet has to be retransmitted many times before getting to the final destination , leading to a sub - linear scaling of system throughput .",
    "a natural question is whether the gupta - kumar scaling law is a consequence of the physical - layer technology or whether one can do better using more sophisticated physical - layer processing .",
    "more generally , what is the _ information - theoretic _ scaling law of ad hoc networks ?",
    "this question was first addressed by xie and kumar @xcite .",
    "they showed that whenever the power path loss exponent @xmath14 of the environment is greater than @xmath15 ( i.e. the received power decays faster than @xmath16 with the distance @xmath1 from the transmitter ) , then the nearest - neighbor multihop scheme is in fact order - optimal .",
    "they also showed that the same conclusion holds if the power path loss is exponential in the distance @xmath1 , a channel model proposed recently by franceschetti et al @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite was followed by several others @xcite .",
    "successively , they improved the threshold on the path loss exponent @xmath14 for which multihop is order - optimal ( @xmath17 in @xcite , @xmath18 in @xcite and @xmath8 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the question is open for the important range of @xmath14 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 corresponding to free space attenuation .",
    "there is an important difference between the network model used in @xcite and that used in @xcite and the follow - up works . the paper @xcite deals with _ dense _ networks , where the total area is fixed and the density of nodes increases .",
    "the paper @xcite and the subsequent works , on the other hand , focus on _ extended _ networks , which scale to cover an increasing area with the density of nodes fixed . a way to understand",
    "the difference between the engineering implications of these two network scalings is by drawing a parallelism with the classical notions of _ interference - limitedness _ and _ coverage - limitedness _ , the two operating regimes of cellular networks .",
    "cellular networks in urban areas tend to have dense deployments of base - stations so that signals are received at the mobiles with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) but performance is limited by _ interference _ between transmissions in adjacent cells .",
    "cellular networks in rural areas , on the other hand , tend to have sparse deployments of base - stations so that performance is mainly limited by the ability to transmit enough power to reach all the users with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "analogously , in the dense network scaling , all nodes can communicate with each other with sufficient snr ; performance can only be limited by interference , if at all .",
    "the gupta - kumar scaling of @xmath6 comes precisely from such interference limitation . in the extended network",
    "scaling , the source and destination pairs are at increasing distance from each other , and so both interference limitation and power limitation can come into play",
    ". the network can be either coverage - limited or interference - limited . the information - theoretic limit on performance proved in @xcite",
    "are all based on bounding the maximum amount of power that can be transferred across the network and then showing that multihop achieves that bound .",
    "hence , what was shown by these works is that for @xmath8 , when signals attenuate fast enough , the extended network is fundamentally coverage - limited : even with optimal cooperative relaying , the amount of power transferred across the network can not be larger than that achieved by multihop . for @xmath14 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , when attenuation is lower and power transfer become easier , the question remains open whether the network is coverage - limited or interference - limited .",
    "viewing the earlier results in this light , a natural first step in completing the picture is to return to the simpler dense network as a vehicle to focus exclusively on the issue of interference .",
    "can the interference limitation implied by the gupta - kumar result be overcome by more sophisticated physical - layer processing ? in a recent work @xcite , aeron and saligrama have showed that the answer is indeed yes : they exhibited a scheme which yields a throughput scaling of @xmath22 bits / second .",
    "however , it is not clear if one can do even better .",
    "the first main result in this paper is that , for any value of @xmath23 , one can in fact achieve arbitrarily close to _ linear _ scaling : for any @xmath24 , we present a scheme that achieves an aggregate rate of @xmath25 . this is a surprising result : a linear scaling means that there is essentially _ no _ interference - limitation ; the rate for _ each _ source - destination pair does not degrade significantly even as one puts more and more nodes in the network . it is easy to show that one can not get a better capacity scaling than @xmath26 ,",
    "so our scheme is close to optimal .    to achieve linear scaling",
    ", one must be able to perform _ many _ simultaneous long - range communications . a physical - layer technique which achieves this is mimo ( multi - input multi - output ) :",
    "the use of multiple transmit and receive antennas to multiplex several streams of data and transmit them simultaneously .",
    "mimo was originally developed in the point - to - point setting , where the transmit antennas are co - located at a single transmit node , each transmitting one data stream , and the receive antennas are co - located at a single receive node , jointly processing the vector of received observations at the antennas . a natural approach to apply this concept to the network setting",
    "is to have both source nodes and destination nodes cooperate in _ clusters _ to form distributed transmit and receive antenna arrays respectively . in this way",
    ", mutually interfering signals can be turned into useful ones that can be jointly decoded at the receive cluster and spatial multiplexing gain can be realized .",
    "in fact , if _ all _ the nodes in the network could cooperate for free , then a classical mimo result @xcite says that a sum rate scaling proportional to @xmath0 could be achieved .",
    "however , this may be over - optimistic : communication between nodes is required to set up the cooperation and this may drastically reduce the useful throughput .",
    "the aeron - saligrama scheme is mimo - based and its performance is precisely limited by the cooperation overhead between receive nodes . our main contribution is to introduce a new _ multi - scale , hierarchical _ cooperation architecture without significant overhead .",
    "such cooperation first takes place between nodes within very small local clusters to facilitate mimo communication over a larger spatial scale .",
    "this can then be used as a communication infrastructure for cooperation within larger clusters at the next level of the hierarchy .",
    "continuing on this fashion , cooperation can be achieved at an almost global scale .",
    "the result in the dense network builds the foundation for understanding the extended network in the low - attenuation regime of the path loss exponent @xmath14 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "cooperative mimo communication provides not only a degree of freedom gain but also a power gain , obtained by combining signals received at the different nodes .",
    "this power gain is not very important in the dense setting , since there is already sufficient snr in any direct communication between individual nodes and the capacity is only _ logarithmic _ in the snr . in the extended",
    "setting , however , this power gain becomes very important , since the power transferred between an individual source and destination pair vanishes due to channel attenuation .",
    "the operation is in the low snr regime where the capacity is _ linear _ in the snr .",
    "cooperation between nodes can significantly boost up the power transfer .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the capacity of long range @xmath0 by @xmath0 cooperative mimo transmission scales exactly like the total received power .",
    "this total received power scales like @xmath4 .",
    "we show that a simple modification of our hierarchical cooperation scheme to the extended setting can achieve a network total throughput arbitrarily close to this cooperative mimo scaling .",
    "thus , for @xmath27 , our scheme performs strictly better than multihop .",
    "can we do better ? recall that earlier results in @xcite are all based on upper bounding the amount of power transferred across cutsets of the network .",
    "it turns out that their upper bounds are tight when @xmath28 but not tight for @xmath14 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 . by evaluating exactly the scaling of the power",
    "transferred , we show that it matches the performance of the hierarchical scheme for @xmath14 between @xmath19 and @xmath29 and that of the multihop scheme for @xmath30 .",
    "more precisely , we obtain the following tight characterization for the scaling exponent for all @xmath14 in the extended case : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total capacity of the network . in particular , when @xmath33 , linear capacity scaling can be achieved , even in the extended case .",
    "note that the capacity is limited by the power transferred for _ all _ @xmath23 ; hence the extended network is fundamentally _ coverage - limited _ , even for @xmath14 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "multihop is sufficient in transferring the optimal amount of power ; for @xmath35 , when the attenuation is slower , cooperative mimo is needed to provide the power gain and also enough degrees of freedom to operate in the power - efficient regime . just like in the dense setting ,",
    "interference limitation does not play a significant role , as far as capacity scaling is concerned .",
    "cooperative mimo takes care of that .",
    "our approach to the problem is to first look at the dense case to isolate the issue of interference and then to tackle the extended case .",
    "but the dense scaling is also of interest on its own right .",
    "it is relevant whenever one wants to design networks to serve many nodes , all within communication range of each other ( within a campus , an urban block , etc . ) .",
    "this scaling is also a reasonable model to study problems such as _ spectrum sharing _",
    ", where many users in a geographical area are sharing a wide band of spectrum . consider the scenario where we segregate the total bandwidth into many orthogonal bands , one for each separate network supporting a _ fixed _ number of users .",
    "as we increase the number of users , the number of such segregated networks increases but the _ spectral efficiency _ , in bits",
    "/ s / hz , does not scale with the _ total _ number of users .",
    "in contrast , if we build one large ad hoc network for all the users on the entire bandwidth , then our result says that the spectral efficiency actually increases _ linearly _ with the number of users .",
    "the gain is coming from a _ network _ effect via cooperation between the many nodes in the system .",
    "the rest of the paper is summarized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we present the model and discuss the various assumptions . section [ sec : outline ] contains the main result for dense networks and an outline of the proposed architecture together with a back - of - the - envelope analysis of its performance .",

    "there are @xmath0 nodes uniformly and independently distributed in a square of unit area in the dense scaling ( sections  [ sec : outline ] and [ sec : details ] ) and a square of area @xmath0 in the extended scaling ( section  [ sec : extended ] ) .",
    "every node is both a source and a destination .",
    "the sources and destinations are paired up one - to - one in an arbitrary fashion .",
    "each source has the same traffic rate @xmath9 to send to its destination node and a common average transmit power budget of @xmath36 watts .",

    "the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath23 are assumed to be constants ; @xmath14 is called the path loss exponent .",
    "for example , under free - space line - of - sight propagation , friis formula applies and @xmath51|^2 = \\frac{g_{tx } \\cdot g_{rx}}{\\left ( 4\\pi r_{ik}/\\lambda_c \\right)^2}\\ ] ] so that @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the transmitter and receiver antenna gains respectively and @xmath55 is the carrier wavelength .",
    "note that the channel is random , depending on the location of the users and the phases .",
    "the locations are assumed to be fixed over the duration of the communication .",
    "the phases are assumed to vary in a stationary ergodic manner ( fast fading ) . for further discussion on this point .",
    "] we assume that the channel gains are known at all the nodes .",

    "several comments about the model are in order :    * the path loss model is based on a _ far - field _ assumption : the distance @xmath46 is assumed to be much larger than the carrier wavelength .",
    "when the distance is of the order or shorter than the carrier wavelength , the simple path loss model obviously does not hold anymore as path loss can potentially become path  gain \" .",
    "the reason is that near - field electromagnetics now come into play .",
    "* the phase @xmath47 $ ] depends on the distance between the nodes modulo the carrier wavelength @xcite .",
    "the random phase model is thus also based on a far - field assumption : we are assuming that the nodes separation is at a much larger spatial scale compared to the carrier wavelength , so that the phases can be modelled as completely random and independent of the actual positions .",
    "* it is realistic to assume the variation of the phases since they vary significantly when users move a distance of the order of the carrier wavelength ( fractions of a meter ) .",
    "the positions determine the path losses and they on the other hand vary over a much larger spatial scale . so the positions are assumed to be fixed .",
    "* we essentially assume a line - of - sight type environment and ignore multipath effects .",
    "the randomness in phases is sufficient for the long range mimo transmissions needed in our scheme . with multipaths",
    ", there is a further randomness due to random constructive and destructive interference of these paths .",
    "it can be seen that our results easily extend to the multipath case .",
    "we will discuss further the limitations of this model in section [ sec : discussions ] after we present our results .",
    "we first give an information - theoretic upper bound on the achievable scaling law for the aggregate throughput in the network . before starting to look for good communication strategies , theorem  [ thm : thm2 ]",
    "establishes the best we can hope for .    [ thm : thm2 ] the aggregate throughput in the network with @xmath0 nodes is bounded above by @xmath60 with high probability as system size grows . ] for some constant @xmath61 independent of @xmath0 .    _",

    "@xcite ) , we get : @xmath65 it is easy to see that in a random network with @xmath0 nodes uniformly distributed on a fixed two - dimensional area , the minimum distance between any two nodes in the network is larger than @xmath66 with high probability , for any @xmath67",
    ". consider one specific node in the network which is at distance larger than @xmath66 to all other nodes in the network .",

    "thus by the union bound we have , @xmath70 which decreases to zero as @xmath71 with increasing @xmath0 .    hence using this fact on the minimum distance in the network , we obtain @xmath72 for some constant @xmath61 independent of @xmath0 for all - source destination pairs in the network with high probability . the theorem follows.@xmath73    in the view of what is ultimately possible , established by theorem  [ thm : thm2 ] , we are now ready to state the main result of this paper .",
    "[ thm : thm1 ] let @xmath74 .",
    "for any @xmath24 , there exists a constant @xmath75 independent of @xmath0 such that with high probability , an aggregate throughput @xmath76 is achievable in the network for all possible pairings between sources and destinations .",
    "theorem  [ thm : thm1 ] states that it is actually possible to perform arbitrarily close to the bound given in theorem  [ thm : thm2 ] .",
    "the two theorems together establish the capacity scaling for the network up to logarithmic terms .",
    "note how dramatically different is this new linear capacity scaling law from the well - known throughput scaling of @xmath77 implied by @xcite for the same model .",
    "note also that the upper bound in theorem  [ thm : thm2 ] assumes a genie - aided removal of interference between simultaneous transmissions from different sources . by proving theorem  [ thm : thm1 ]",
    ", we will show that it is possible to mitigate such interference without a genie but with cooperation between the nodes .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : thm1 ] relies on the construction of an explicit scheme that realizes the promised scaling law .",
    "the construction is based on recursively using the following key lemma , which addresses the case when @xmath78 .",
    "[ lem : lem1 ] consider @xmath79 and a network with @xmath0 nodes subject to interference from external sources .",

    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 are positive constants independent of @xmath0 and the source - destination pairing , and @xmath90 .",
    "let us also assume that the per node average power budget required to realize this scheme is upper bounded by @xmath91 as opposed to @xmath36",
    ".    then one can construct another scheme for this network that achieves a _ higher _ aggregate throughput @xmath92 for every source - destination pairing in the network , where @xmath93 is another constant independent of @xmath0 and the pairing .",
    "moreover , the failure rate for the new scheme is upper bounded by @xmath94 for another positive constant @xmath95 while the per node average power needed to realize the scheme is also upper bounded by @xmath91 .",
    "lemma  [ lem : lem1 ] is the key step to build a hierarchical architecture .",
    "since @xmath96 for @xmath97 , the new scheme is always better than the old . we will now give a rough description of how the new scheme can be constructed given the old scheme , as well as a back - of - the - envelope analysis of the scaling law it achieves .",
    "next section is devoted to its precise description and performance analysis .",
    "the constructed scheme is based on clustering and long - range mimo transmissions between clusters .",
    "we divide the network into clusters of @xmath98 nodes .",
    "let us focus for now on a particular source node @xmath63 and its destination node @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath63 will send @xmath98 bits to @xmath64 in 3 steps :    * node @xmath63 will distribute its @xmath98 bits among the @xmath98 nodes in its cluster , one for each node ; * these nodes together can then form a distributed transmit antenna array , sending the @xmath98 bits _ simultaneously _ to the destination cluster where @xmath64 lies ; * each node in the destination cluster obtained one observation from the mimo transmission , and it quantizes and ships the observation back to @xmath64 , which can then do joint mimo processing of all the observations and decode the @xmath98 transmitted bits .    from the network point of view , all source - destination pairs have to eventually accomplish these three steps .",
    "step 2 is long - range communication and only one source - destination pair can operate at the same time .",
    "steps 1 and 3 involve local communication and can be parallelized across source - destination pairs . combining all this leads to three phases in the operation of the network :    * phase 1 : setting up transmit cooperation",
    "* clusters work in parallel . within a cluster ,",
    "each source node has to distribute @xmath98 bits to the other nodes , 1 bit for each node , such that at the end of the phase each node has 1 bit from each of the source nodes in the same cluster .",
    "since there are @xmath98 source nodes in each cluster , this gives a traffic demand of exchanging @xmath99 bits .",
    "( recall our assumption that each node is a source for some communication request and destination for another . )",
    "the key observation is that this is similar to the original problem of communicating between @xmath0 source and destination pairs , but on a network of size @xmath98 .",
    "more specifically , this traffic demand of exchanging @xmath99 bits is handled by setting up @xmath98 sub - phases , and assigning @xmath98 source - destination pairs for each sub - phase . since",
    "our channel model is scale invariant , note that the scheme given in the hypothesis of the lemma can be used in each sub - phase by simply scaling down the power with cluster area . having aggregate throughput @xmath100 ,",
    "each sub - phase is completed in @xmath101 time slots while the whole phase takes @xmath102 time slots .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "[ fig : phase1_sec3 ]    * phase 2 : mimo transmissions * we perform successive long - distance mimo transmissions between source - destination pairs , one at a time . in each one of the mimo transmissions , say one between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the @xmath98 bits of @xmath63 are simultaneously transmitted by the @xmath98 nodes in its cluster to the @xmath98 nodes in the cluster of @xmath64 .",
    "each of the long - distance mimo transmissions are repeated for each source node in the network , hence we need @xmath0 time slots to complete the phase .",
    "see figure 2 .",
    "[ fig : phase2 ]    * phase 3 : cooperate to decode * clusters work in parallel .",
    "since there are @xmath98 destination nodes inside the clusters , each cluster received @xmath98 mimo transmissions in phase 2 , one intended for each of the destination nodes in the cluster .",
    "thus , each node in the cluster has @xmath98 received observations , one from each of the mimo transmissions , and each observation is to be conveyed to a different node in its cluster .",
    "nodes quantize each observation into fixed @xmath103 bits so there are now a total of at most @xmath104 bits to exchange inside each cluster . using exactly the same scheme as in phase 1 , we conclude the phase in @xmath105 time slots .",
    "see again figure 1 .",
    "assuming that each destination node is able to decode the transmitted bits from its source node from the @xmath98 quantized signals it gathers by the end of phase 3 , we can calculate the rate of the scheme as follows : each source node is able to transmit @xmath98 bits to its destination node , hence @xmath106 bits in total are delivered to their destinations in @xmath107 time slots , yielding an aggregate throughput of @xmath108 bits per time slot . maximizing this throughput by choosing @xmath109 yields @xmath110 for the aggregate throughput which is the result in lemma  [ lem : lem1 ] .",
    "clusters can work in parallel in phases 1 and 3 because for @xmath111 , the aggregate interference at a particular cluster caused by other active nodes is bounded , moreover the interference signals received by different nodes in the cluster are zero - mean and uncorrelated satisfying the assumptions of lemma  [ lem : lem1 ] . for @xmath112 ,",

    "moreover , the failure rate for the new scheme is upper bounded by @xmath94 for another positive constant @xmath95 while the per node average power needed to realize the scheme is also upper bounded by @xmath91 .",

    "_ proof of theorem  [ thm : thm1 ] : _ we only focus on the case of @xmath79 .",
    "the case of @xmath21 proceeds similarly .",
    "we start by observing that the simple scheme of transmitting directly between the source - destination pairs one at a time ( tdma ) satisfies the requirements of the lemma .",
    "the aggregate throughput is @xmath120 , so @xmath121 .",
    "the failure probability is @xmath122 . since each source is only transmitting @xmath123th of the time and the distance between the source and its destination",
    "is bounded , the average power consumed per node is of the order of @xmath123 .",
    "as soon as we have a scheme to start with , lemma  [ lem : lem1 ] can be applied recursively , yielding a scheme that achieves higher throughput at each step of the recursion .",
    "more precisely , starting with a tdma scheme with @xmath121 and applying lemma  [ lem : lem1 ] recursively @xmath124 times , one gets a scheme achieving @xmath125 aggregate throughput . given any @xmath126 , we can now choose @xmath124 such that @xmath127 and we get a scheme that achieves @xmath128 aggregate throughput scaling with high probability .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem  [ thm : thm1].@xmath73    gathering everything together , we have built a hierarchical scheme to achieve the desired throughput . at the lowest level of the hierarchy , we use the simple tdma scheme to exchange bits for cooperation among small clusters . combining this with longer range mimo transmissions ,",
    "we get a higher throughput scheme for cooperation among nodes in larger clusters at the next level of the hierarchy .",
    "finally , at the top level of the hierarchy , the cooperation clusters are almost the size of the network and the mimo transmissions are over the global scale to meet the desired traffic demands .",
    "figure 3 shows the resulting hierarchical scheme with a focus on the top two levels .",
    "[ fig : hier ]    it is important to understand the aspects of the channel model which the scheme made use of in achieving the linear capacity scaling :    * the random channel phases enable the long - range mimo transmissions . * the path attenuation decay law @xmath129 ( @xmath23 ) ensures that the _ aggregate _ signals from far away nodes are much weaker than signals from close - by nodes .",
    "this enables spatial reuse .",

    ", we will need a stronger result , namely each of the @xmath142 possible halves of a square should contain order @xmath143 nodes with high probability which again follows from the lemma together with the union bound .",
    "this condition is sufficient for our below analysis on scaling laws to hold .",

    "in this section , we point out the scope and limitations of the model and the results .",
    "we should emphasize that the focus in this paper , as well as in @xcite and the follow - up works , is on scaling laws , i.e. scaling of the aggregate throughput in the limit when the number of users gets large .",
    "the main advantage of studying scaling laws is to highlight qualitative and architectural properties of the system without getting bogged down by too many details .",
    "for example , the linear scaling law in dense networks we derived highlights the fact that interference limitation in the gupta - kumar scaling is not a fundamental one and can be alleviated by more complicated physical layer processing .",
    "it is important to distinguish between such scaling law study and the design and performance analysis of a scheme for a network with a given number of users .",
    "while scaling law results provide some architectural guidelines on how to design schemes that scale well , detailed design and performance analysis would involve tuning of many parameters and improvements of the scheme to optimize the pre - constant in the system throughput .",
    "for example , our scheme quantizes the received analog signal at each node and forward the bits to the final destination , but the quantized bits are correlated across the receive nodes and hence a reduction in the overhead can be achieved by doing some slepian - wolf coding .",
    "such work is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we studied two different scaling laws in this paper , one for dense and one for extended networks .",
    "given a network with a specific number of nodes occupying a specific area , a natural question is : is this network best described by the dense scaling regime or the extended scaling regime ?",
    "what our results say is that a better delineation is in terms of whether we are in the degree - of - freedom limited or power(coverage)-limited regime , because this is what will have architectural implications for the communication scheme ( for example , whether bursty transmissions are required ) . to get a sense of the operating regime a given network is in ,",
    "our results suggest a rule - of - thumb quantity that can be calculated : the total received snr per node , total over all the transmit powers of the nodes in the network .",
    "if this quantity is much larger than @xmath122 db , then the network is in the degree - of - freedom limited regime ; otherwise it is in the power - limited regime .",
    "one potential concern with the dense scaling is that the far - field assumption will eventually break down as the number of nodes gets too large . in practice ,",
    "the typical separation between nodes is so much larger than the carrier wavelength that the number of nodes for which the far - field assumption fails is humongous , i.e. there is a clear separation between the large and the small spatial scales .",
    "consider the following numerical example : suppose the area of interest is @xmath141 square km , well within the communication range of many radio devices . with a carrier frequency of @xmath29 ghz , the carrier wavelength is @xmath353 m . even with a very large system size of @xmath354 nodes , the typical separation between nearest neighbors is @xmath355 m , very much in the far - field . under free - space propagation and assuming unit transmit and receive antenna gains , the attenuation given by friis formula ( [ eq : friis ] ) is about @xmath356 , much smaller than unity . at the same time , the total received snr per node ( assuming transmit power @xmath36 of @xmath141 mw per node , thermal noise @xmath59 at @xmath357 dbm , a bandwidth @xmath39 of @xmath355 mhz and noise figure nf= @xmath355 db ) is @xmath358 db , very much in the degree - of - freedom limited regime ] .",
    "( looking at even only one point - to - point link at distance @xmath141 km , the received snr is @xmath359 db ) .",
    "hence , this example gives evidence that there are networks for which simultaneously the number of nodes is large , the far - field assumption holds and the received snr across the network is high .",
    "however , a careful performance analysis of the pre - constants is required to confirm that linear scaling of our scheme has already kicked in and our scheme indeed outperforms multi - hop in this parameter range .",
    "nevertheless , we do believe that the linear scaling obtained here also applies for a relatively small number of nodes .",
    "the intuition for this is that our strategy relies on the use of mimo communication , whose linear capacity scaling has never been disputed in the range of a small number of antennas .",
    "we have focused on the 2d setting , where the nodes are on the plane , but our results generalize naturally to networks where nodes live in @xmath64-dimensional space . for dense networks , linear scaling is achievable whenever @xmath360 , i.e.  whenever spatial reuse is possible . for extended networks ,",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath361 is given by : @xmath362 for @xmath14 between @xmath64 and @xmath363 , hierarchical mimo achieves the optimal scaling , and for @xmath364 , nearest neighbor multihop is optimal .",
    "let us finally mention that a more general measure of network performance has been introduced in @xcite : the _ transport capacity _ of a network , defined as the maximum number of bits exchanged in the network per second , weighted by their travelled distances . from an upper bound on transport capacity , one can easily deduce an upper bound on the aggregate throughput for the special case where the source - destination pairs are chosen at random and communicating at a common rate , which is the traffic requirement considered in the current paper .",
    "but the interest in an _ upper bound _ on transport capacity lies in the fact that it applies to more general communication scenarios .",
    "reciprocally , it has been shown recently in @xcite that for a network with a random placement of nodes , there is a natural way to deduce an upper bound on transport capacity from an upper bound on throughput , by studying cutset bounds over multiple cuts ( as first suggested in @xcite ) . applying this technique to the present result leads to the following conclusion : the transport capacity @xmath365 of the extended network is upper bounded by    * @xmath366 , for @xmath367 , * @xmath368 , for @xmath34 ,    for any @xmath305 , where @xmath265 is a constant independent of @xmath0 .",
    "note that these scaling laws for the transport capacity are also achievable within a factor of @xmath369 .",
    "in point - to - point communication , performance is limited by either the power or the degrees of freedom ( bandwidth and number of antennas ) available , depending on whether the link is operating at low or high signal - to - noise ratio . in a network with multiple source - destination pairs",
    ", performance can further be limited by the interference between simultaneous transmission of information . in this paper , we have shown that by achieving near global mimo cooperation between nodes without introducing significant cooperation overhead , interference can be successfully removed as a limitation , at least as far as scaling laws are concerned . moreover , such near - global mimo cooperation also allows the maximum transfer of energy between all source - destination pairs , provided that the path loss across the network is not too much .",
    "this implies that in degrees - of - freedom limited scenarios , such as in dense networks or extended networks with path loss exponent @xmath21 , the full degrees of freedom in the network can be shared among all nodes and a linear capacity scaling can be achieved . in power - limited scenarios but with low attenuation , such as extended networks with @xmath14 between @xmath19 and @xmath29 , our scheme achieves the optimal ( power - limited ) capacity scaling law .",
    "the key ideas behind our scheme are :    * using mimo for long - range communication to achieve spatial multiplexing ; * local transmit and receive cooperation to maximize spatial reuse ; * setting up the intra - cluster cooperation such that it is yet another digital communication problem , but in a smaller network , thus enabling a hierarchical cooperation architecture .",
