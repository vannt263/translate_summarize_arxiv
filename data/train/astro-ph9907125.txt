    "the coma halo is the most famous example of a diffuse radio emission in clusters of galaxies .    at the lowest frequencies the radio emission extends up to @xmath1 arcmin from the center ( e.g. hanisch & erickson 1980 at 43 mhz ; henning 1989 at 30.9 mhz ) , while at higher frequencies",
    "detailed radio images have been obtained at 327 mhz ( venturi et al .",
    "1990 ) and at 1.38 ghz ( kim et al . 1990 ) . by applying gaussian fits",
    "it has been found that the 327 mhz fwhm ( 28@xmath220 arcmin ) is significantly larger than that inferred at 1.38 ghz ( 18.7@xmath213.7 arcmin ) , but smaller than the low frequency size .",
    "the 3271400 mhz spectral index map of the coma halo shows that the spectrum steepens rapidly with increasing distance from the center ( giovannini et al.1993 ) .",
    "the coma halo has also been observed with the effelsberg single  dish 100 m telescope ( deiss et al .",
    "1997 , at 1.4 ghz ; schlickeiser et al .",
    "1987 , at 2.7 ghz ) .",
    "the 1.4 ghz observations reveal a flux density at large scales higher than that measured with the synthesis aperture instruments and confirm a spectral index steepening with increasing radius .",
    "the 2.7 ghz measurements appear to be inconsistent with these results suggesting that the schlickeiser et al .",
    "integrated flux may be underestimated ( deiss et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "lieu et al.(1996 ) have detected extreme ultraviolet emission ( euv ) in excess to that expected by extrapolating downward the thermal x  ray spectrum emitted by the intracluster gas ( kt = 8.21 kev ) .",
    "recently , fusco  femiano et al.(1999 ) have discovered an hard x  ray tail exceeding the thermal emission .",
    "synchrotron emission in the radio band , inverse compton ( ic ) emission in the euv and hard x ",
    "rays from cluster of galaxies are expected in the framework of continuous injection of primary relativistic electrons ( sarazin 1999 ; vlk & atoyan 1999 ) . the models invoking a secondary production of the relativistic electrons also predict a large gamma  ray flux from neutral pion decay ; in the case of coma , an ic origin of the hard x - ray tail would lead to a gamma  ray flux considerably larger than the egret upper limit ( blasi & colafrancesco 1999 ) .",
    "in this paper we will assume @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "a model should be able to reproduce the observed steepening in the radio spectral index distribution , the integrated radio spectrum and the brightness distribution observed at different frequencies .",
    "the spectral steepening with radius is probably the most difficult to reproduce .",
    "it can not be related to the diffusion of fast ageing particles from the central part into the cluster volume , because the diffusion velocity is relatively low ( berezinsky et al .",
    "1997 ) and the diffusion time is too large compared to the radiative time of the relativistic electrons ( sarazin 1999 ) .    alternatively one might consider a continuous injection of fresh particles in the cluster volume . to justify the steep spectrum observed in the peripheral regions of the coma cluster",
    "one would have to assume a space modulation of the injection rate such that the injection is progressively stopped moving from the periphery toward the center in a crossing time smaller than the radiative time of the emitting particles .",
    "this appears to be difficult to achieve in the coma cluster , since the physical mechanism responsible for such a modulation should then propagate at a velocity 2050 times larger than the sound speed .",
    "it may be thought that these problems can be solved by assuming that the spectrum of the continuously injected particles is steeper with increasing distance from the cluster center .",
    "however , it can be shown that the superposition of the corresponding synchrotron spectra , constrained by the observed brightness distribution , leads to an integral spectrum flat at high frequencies ( @xmath5 ) and steep at low frequencies ( @xmath6 ) , in contrast with the observations that do not show a substantial flattening of the spectrum at high frequencies .      in order to avoid the above mentioned difficulties",
    ", we investigate the possibility that systematic reacceleration is present in the cluster gas and propose a two phases scenario for the coma halo .    during the first phase the particles are injected and reaccelerated over the cluster volume ( starting at @xmath7 ) for a relatively long time",
    "( @xmath8 13 gyrs ) by a major merger event ; evidence of a recent merging has been pointed out ( see briel et al .",
    "1992 for a discussion on recent mergings ) .",
    "we further assume that following the injection phase the particles are being systematically reaccelerated for a relatively short time ( @xmath9 ) till the present cosmic time @xmath10 by secondary accretion shocks and/or turbulence .    by assuming a power law injection spectrum ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "the evolution of the particle density during the injection phase can be obtained by solving the kinetic equation ( kardashev 1962 ) :    @xmath12 + q\\gamma^{-\\delta}\\ ] ]    with @xmath13 the radiative losses ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 the rate of systematic reacceleration .",
    "we assume that the main cooling mechanism for the relativistic particles in the coma cluster is the ic scattering with the cmb photons , implying an average strength of the magnetic field @xmath16 g across the cluster .",
    "the solution for the first phase , at time @xmath17 , is given by :    @xmath18 } } \\cdot \\nonumber\\\\ \\ { e^{(\\delta-1)\\alpha ( t_1-t_2 ) }   [ 1-{{\\gamma}\\over{\\gamma^0_b}}]^{\\delta-1 } -1 \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath19 , and    @xmath20^{-1}\\ ] ]    for @xmath21 .",
    "if the particles are reaccelerated during the second phase for a time @xmath22 , from eq.(2 ) ( under our assumptions the majority of the particles follow eq.2 ) the spectrum becomes :    @xmath23^{\\delta-1 } -1 \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath24 , being zero at higher energies .",
    "if the reacceleration is sufficiently efficient , i.e.@xmath25 , eq.(4 ) approaches to : without low energy cut  off . in the case of a low energy cut  off and/or coulomb losses",
    "the evolution of the particle energy distribution is much more complicated ( brunetti et al .",
    "1999 ) , but the main results of the model are still valid . ]",
    "@xmath26    we remark that , if the second phase is sufficiently long , the reacceleration during the first phase is not necessary to obtain the final shape .    under the assumption that the electron momenta are isotropically distributed and eq.(5 ) ,",
    "the synchrotron emissivity is given by ( jaffe & perola,1973 ) :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the pitch angle , and @xmath29 is the critical frequency ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "deiss et al.(1997 ) derived relationships between the observed spectral index and the intrinsic spectral index distribution of the synchrotron emission assuming a spherical symmetry of the relevant physical quantities .    by assuming a gaussian spatial profile of the emission coefficient they derive the intrinsic spectral index at a given radius and the observed spectral index at the same radius ( projected on the plane of the sky ) as a function of observable quantities . in the case of the coma halo",
    "they have shown that the fwhms and flux densities of the radio observations ( venturi et al .",
    "1990 ; kim et al .",
    "1990 ) can be reproduced by a central intrinsic spectral index @xmath32 , leading to a central observed spectral index of @xmath33 , in agreement with giovannini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) findings . in fig.1",
    "we plot the observed and intrinsic spectral index predicted for the coma halo from deiss et al .",
    "( 1997 ) relationships based on the measurements at 327 mhz ( venturi et al.1990 ) , 1.38 ghz ( kim et al . 1990 ) , and 1.4 ghz ( deiss et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the points in fig .",
    "1 are taken from two different slices trough the coma halo ( giovannini et al . 1993 ) .    from eq.(6 ) we obtain the shape of the synchrotron spectrum as a function of the frequency measured in terms of the break frequency @xmath29 . by calculating the spectral index between two nominal frequencies of constant ratio 1.4 ghz/327mhz ,",
    "the break frequency @xmath34 is obtained when the calculated matches the intrinsic spectral index of fig.1 .",
    "the break frequency as a function of @xmath35 is represented in fig.2 for several values of the injected electron spectral index @xmath36 .    due to the very flat intrinsic spectral index at the center of the coma halo ( @xmath37 )",
    ", the models with @xmath38 can not match the data within @xmath39 arcmin from the center and the break frequency goes to infinity ( fig.2 ) .",
    "a correction to deiss et al .",
    "( 1997 ) relationships , due to the non perfect spherical symmetry of the coma halo ( we assume it elongated on the plane of the sky ) , produces a steeper intrinsic radio spectral indices in the central part of the cluster allowing also the models with @xmath40 to converge .",
    "however , since we do not know the three  dimensional structure of the coma halo , the modeling of the central @xmath010 arcmin and the determination of the physical properties remain uncertain .    as a zero order approximation",
    "we assume that the large scale magnetic field @xmath41 is approximately constant over the volume of the cluster . in this case",
    ", different break frequencies in the synchrotron spectrum directly correspond to different break energies in the electron energy distribution , i.e. different reacceleration times ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) . in fig.3",
    "we give the reacceleration time as a function of @xmath35 for a number of choices of the intracluster magnetic field . in order to explain the very flat intrinsic radio spectrum in the cluster center the efficiency of the reacceleration should rapidly increase and the reacceleration time should become smaller toward the central region , whereas in the peripheral regions the reacceleration times are larger than @xmath44yrs .    by integrating eq.(6 ) along the line of sight",
    "we obtain the radio brightness at a given frequency as a function of the projected distance from the center .",
    "given the magnetic field strength @xmath41 and the geometry , the brightness is a function of the normalization @xmath45 of the emitting electron population . the model should reproduce the fwhms of the radio brightness observed at different frequencies ( 327 mhz , 1380 mhz , and 1400 mhz ) ; by comparing the predicted and observed fwhms one obtains @xmath45 . we find that a good representation is a @xmath13model  type function : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 depends on the assumed value of @xmath41 .",
    "the model at this point can reproduce both the observed and intrinsic synchrotron spectral indices between 327 and 1400 mhz and the observed fwhms of the brightness distribution at these frequencies .",
    "a fundamental test is to check whether the model can reproduce the shape of the total synchrotron spectrum observed from the coma halo .",
    "we have then integrated eq.(6 ) , with the derived @xmath48 ( fig.2 , solid lines ) and @xmath45 , over the volume .",
    "the result is given in fig.4 for the representative value @xmath49 ( the results with @xmath36 between 1.92.2 being very similar ) ; the model appears to be well consistent with the data .",
    "from a deep bepposax observation , fusco  femiano et al.(1999 ) discovered an hard x  ray tail in the range 2080 kev exceeding the extrapolation of the thermal x - ray emission spectrum ; this excess has also been confirmed by an rxte observation ( rephaeli et al .",
    "1999 ) . due to the poor statistics ,",
    "the spectrum is not well constrained and the origin of this high energy emission can not be firmly established .",
    "it can be generated in non ",
    "thermal processes , possibly ic of the radio emitting electrons with the cmb photons ( fusco  femiano et al . 1999 ; sarazin et al .",
    "1999 ; sarazin & lieu 1998 ) , or it might originate from a supra  thermal power law tail of particles emitting via relativistic bremsstrahlung ( ensslin et al . 1999 ) . furthermore ,",
    "as recently shown in detail ( dogiel , these proceedings ) , it could also be of thermal origin ( from a modification of the pure maxwellian distribution of the hot cluster gas induced by strong acceleration processes ) .",
    "the ic origin is particularly fascinating in view of the fact that a comparison between the radio emission from the halo and the hard x  ray tail discovered by bepposax allows to calculate the average strength ( over the cluster volume ) of the magnetic field @xmath41 ( fusco  femiano et al .",
    "1999 ) .    since in the present model the break energy of the electron population depends on the distance from the cluster center ,",
    "the synchrotron as well as the ic spectra are emitted by relativistic electrons whose energy distribution can not be represented by a unique power law over all the volume . therefore , the magnetic field can not be simply evaluated by standard formulae ( e.g.harris & grindlay 1979 ) . under our assumptions",
    "the ic emissivity per unit energy and solid angle in the thomson approximation is given by :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the energy of the cmb photons and for ultra ",
    "relativistic electrons @xmath52 ( e.g. blumenthal & gould 1970 )",
    ". the total ic emission is readily obtained by integrating eq.(7 ) over the volume .",
    "in fig.5 we plot the expected ic flux from our model for different magnetic fields and compare the results with the observations ; the calculations are performed for @xmath49 ( in the model the value of @xmath41 is stable with @xmath53 ) .",
    "clearly the model can not account at the same time for the observed euvs , x ",
    "rays and gamma  ray upper limits .",
    "the x  ray data are well accounted for by a magnetic field @xmath54 , in agreement with the strength of a large scale magnetic field requested by faraday rotation measurements ( feretti et al .",
    "furthermore , it should be noticed that the effect due to coulomb losses on the electron energy distribution has not been taken into account in the ic calculation of fig.5 .",
    "these losses depress the electron energy distribution at low energies ( @xmath55 ) so that the estimated ic emission in the euv band should be considered as an upper limit ( the predicted euv flux would be @xmath0 3  5 times smaller than the observed value ) .    due to the decrease of the synchrotron break frequency with @xmath35 , in our model",
    "the observed radio fwhms are expected to be smaller than the predicted ic euv fwhm .",
    "this is contrary to the observational evidence ( bowyer & berghoefer 1998 ; ensslin et al .",
    "1999 ) , but consistent with our ic model which underproduces by a large factor the observed euv flux .      if the euv excess is of non  thermal nature , an additional electron population is requested ( bowyer & berghoefer 1998 ; ensslin et al .",
    "it seems natural to assume an additional population of relativistic electrons , with a relatively steep energy distribution ( @xmath56 ) , injected in the core of the coma cluster by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .    since the physical conditions at each radius are the same for the two populations , the break energies of this additional population should be distributed as those of the synchrotron electrons ( fig.2 , solid lines ) .",
    "the normalization of the particle spectrum is obtained by imposing that it gives the observed euv emission via ic scattering with the cmb photons .",
    "the radio spectral indices , radio brightness profiles , total synchrotron spectrum and hard x  ray ic emission predicted by our model are not substantially modified by the introduction of this additional electron population due to the assumed steep spectral index .",
    "we have studied the effect of a systematic reacceleration on the relativistic plasma in the coma halo . systematic reacceleration may compensate for the radiative losses providing a suitable mechanism to solve the problem of the very short radiative life - times of the relativistic electrons in the clusters .",
    "we propose a two phase scenario in which the particles are injected and reaccelerated in the cluster volume for a sufficiently long time ( @xmath57 gyrs ) , after which they are reaccelerated up to the present time . the first phase ( the injection phase )",
    "is probably related to a major merger process in which relic particles ( cosmic rays from galaxies and/or thermal particles ) are ( re)accelerated by shocks and/or induced strong turbulence . during the second phase ( post major merger phase )",
    "the electrons lose energy by emitting radiation and , at the same time , are reaccelerated by the cluster weather ( i.e. galactic winds , accretion shocks , and/or turbulence ) .",
    "the combination of losses and reacceleration produces flat synchrotron spectra in the central region and very steep spectra in the peripheral region well matching the observed radio spectral distribution in the coma halo . by assuming a constant value of @xmath41 , the requested reacceleration times are relatively large on the majority of the radio halo volume and the reacceleration",
    "can be easily provided by systematic fermi mechanisms .",
    "strong reaccelerations are requested only in the central region of the coma halo ( especially in the case of a small @xmath41 which is required by the ic production of the observed hard x  ray tail ) .",
    "the problem of short acceleration times can be eased by assuming a gradual increase of the magnetic field strength toward the center of the cluster . since this would be necessary only in a small fraction of the cluster volume , our assumption of a constant magnetic field strength over the cluster seems very reasonable .",
    "we show that the model can well reproduce the observed brightness profiles at 327 , 1380 , and 1400 mhz , and the observed integrated synchrotron spectrum .",
    "we have also shown that the model can account for the hard x  ray flux observed with bepposax via the ic scattering of the cmb photons with the synchrotron electrons if a magnetic field @xmath54 is assumed throughout the cluster medium . in this case , the predicted hard x  ray spectral index is @xmath58 and the fwhm of the hard x  ray profile is expected to be @xmath59 arcmin , i.e. considerably larger than the synchrotron fwhm at 327 mhz ; obviously , it would be very interesting to test these findings with future observations .",
    "the energy of the relativistic electrons reservoir would be @xmath60erg s@xmath4 , i.e. @xmath61 of the thermal energy of the intracluster gas , far greater than the energy in the magnetic field .",
    "the euv excess from the coma cluster can not be accounted for by ic scattering of the synchrotron electrons with the cmb photons , the predicted emissivity being a factor @xmath62 smaller than observed .",
    "if the euv excess is non  thermal , then the presence of an additional population of relativistic particles with a more peaked radial distribution must be assumed .",
    "we find that the synchrotron and ic hard x  ray contributions from an additional population of relativistic electrons with a steep spectral index ( @xmath63 ) , matching the euv excess via ic scattering with the cmb photons , do not substantially alter the fluxes estimated from the first population .",
    "the additional population has a total energy in electrons similar to the first one and may have been injected by agns activity within the cluster core during most of the cluster life .",
    "a much more detailed discussion about the time evolution of the relativistic plasma and the emitted synchrotron and ic spectra , including the combined effects of coulomb losses , systematic reacceleration and magnetic field dependence on @xmath35 , will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( brunetti et al .",
