    "the recent discovery of a vast population of free - floating brown dwarfs in the vicinity of the sun @xcite has led to the definition of two new spectroscopic classes , l dwarfs and t dwarfs .",
    "these are the first additions to the standard stellar sequence in over 60 years , encompassing objects cooler than the m spectral class .",
    "l dwarfs @xcite are characterized by absorption bands of metal hydrides ( e.g. , feh , crh , and mgh ) , strong alkali lines ( li , na , k , rb , and cs ) , and h@xmath2o and co absorption in the near - infrared .",
    "below effective temperatures @xmath3 , co reduces to @xmath4 @xcite , a molecule which has distinct absorption bands at 1.6 and @xmath5 .",
    "objects exhibiting these @xmath4 features have grossly different spectroscopic and photometric properties as compared to l dwarfs , and are designated t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic sequence m to l to t is the evolutionary cooling sequence for a typical brown dwarf .",
    "l dwarfs are further characterized by the presence of condensates near or just below their photospheres .",
    "these condensates include liquid iron ; solid vo ; and aluminum , calcium , magnesium , and titanium - bearing minerals such as enstatite ( @xmath6 ) , grossite ( @xmath7 ) , and perovskite ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "the opacity of the condensate grains and droplets gives l dwarfs fairly red near - infrared colors , with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "conversely , condensates in mid- and late - type t dwarfs appear to lie deep below the photosphere .",
    "these objects have neutral near - infrared colors , @xmath10 , governed by strong absorption features of @xmath11 , @xmath4 , and collision - induced @xmath12 , particularly at k - band @xcite .",
    "three classes of models have been developed to account for condensates in brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "the dusty model @xcite assumes that condensates remain dispersed in the gas and in chemical equilibrium throughout the atmosphere .",
    "the clear model @xcite removes all condensates from the photosphere as they form , presumably through gravitational settling .",
    "the cloudy model @xcite incorporates condensate cloud formation based on an assumed sedimentation efficiency , @xmath13 .",
    "the dusty and clear models are extreme cases of the cloudy model with very low and very high values of @xmath13 , respectively .    in this paper , we present an exploratory model of partial cloud clearing in cool dwarf atmospheres derived from the cloudy and clear models . in @xmath142",
    "we describe our model and compare its derived photometry to the near - infrared color - magnitude diagram of late - type dwarfs .",
    "this analysis indicates that a rapid clearing of clouds takes place across the l / t transition .",
    "in @xmath143 we present further evidence of cloud clearing in the persistance and strengthening of feh absorption at 9896  in the early- and mid - type t dwarfs .",
    "we discuss our results in @xmath144 .",
    "figure 1 shows the near - infrared color - magnitude diagram for a sample of m , l , and t dwarfs with known parallaxes .",
    "photometry were obtained from the two micron all - sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2mass ) and parallaxes from the usno parallax program @xcite or from hipparcos @xcite in the case of companions to nearby stars .",
    "as described in @xcite , late - type m and l dwarfs are increasingly redder and fainter toward later spectral types , but the transition to the bluer t dwarfs is marked by a distinct brightening at j - band , with both the t2 dwarf sdss j1254 - 0122 @xcite and the t5 dwarf 2mass 0559 - 1404 @xcite being brighter at j - band than the latest - type l dwarfs .",
    "note that neither of these objects is expected to be young and hence less compact ( r @xmath15 1 r@xmath16 ; burrows et al .",
    "1997 ) based on extremely weak or absent h@xmath17 emission ( burgasser et al . 2002a",
    "; kirkpatrick et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "late - type t dwarfs are increasingly bluer in @xmath18 color and fainter at j - band .    also shown in this figure are color - magnitude tracks for the three atmosphere models described above . the dusty model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dashed line ) reproduces the colors of early - type l dwarfs , but continues to redden to colors far greater than those observed for the mid- and late - type l dwarfs .",
    "this is due to the continued influence of dust opacity , which mutes the otherwise strong absorption bands of h@xmath2o , ch@xmath19 , and h@xmath2 .",
    "the clear model ( solid line , left ) reproduces the colors of mid- and late - type t dwarfs , but not those of l dwarfs .",
    "finally , the cloudy model ( solid line , right ) successfully reproduces the near - infrared color limit for the latest - type l dwarfs , @xmath20-@xmath21 @xcite , and subsequently turns to bluer near - infrared colors .",
    "however , the predicted transition occurs over a greater decrease in brightness , @xmath22 mag from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , than is observed .",
    "increasing @xmath13 in this model ( i.e. , moving toward a more cleared photosphere ) allows the color transition to occur at brighter magnitudes , but fails to match the colors and magnitudes of the latest l dwarfs .",
    "therefore , the condensate cloud model , while adequately reproducing the brightness and color evolution of l dwarfs , can not reproduce the observed rapid transition to the t dwarfs .",
    "is it possible to resolve this apparent discrepancy between the cloudy model and the observations ?",
    "all three atmosphere models assume horizontal homogeneity and therefore uniform condensate distribution over the visible disk of the brown dwarf .",
    "however , clouds in the planets of the solar system , for instance jupiter s upper cloud decks of solid nh@xmath25 and nh@xmath19sh , display discrete structures of spots and bands caused by tropospheric weather patterns . breaks between the clouds on jupiter coincide with bright `` hot - spots '' at 5 @xmath26 @xcite , as light emerges from warmer regions well below the upper cloud decks .",
    "since horizontally non - homogeneous clouds are ubiquitous in planetary atmospheres , it is reasonable to expect that similar features could be present in the condensate cloud layers of brown dwarfs as well @xcite .",
    "connecting the cloudy and clear tracks in figure 1 are the predicted fluxes for an alternative model we have developed that allows for partial clearing of condensate clouds .",
    "these were constructed by first linearly interpolating between the fluxes of the clear model and a modified cloudy model in which the cloud opacity has been removed , weighing by the fraction of cloud coverage .",
    "this combination approximates the effect of partial cloud opacity on the underlying atmospheric pressure - temperature profile .",
    "we then linearly interpolated the resulting fluxes with those of the standard cloudy model , again weighing by the fractional cloud coverage , to derive the relative brightness contributions of cloudy and cloud - free regions .",
    "our simple approach assumes that many clouds are distributed randomly across the observed disk .",
    "when compared to the data , we see that the evolution from the red and dusty l dwarfs to the blue and clear t dwarfs can be traced ( heavy line ) down the cloudy track to an effective temperature @xmath27 , across the 1200 k partly cloudy model , and subsequently down the cloud - free track .",
    "sdss j1254 - 0122 is a true transition object , lying close to the 1200 k partly cloudy track at roughly 40% cloud coverage .",
    "2mass j0559 - 1404 , however , appears to have a cloud - free photosphere .",
    "the t@xmath0 at which the color transition appears to take place is only slightly cooler than that estimated for one of the latest - type l dwarfs , gliese 584c ( @xmath28 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2000 ; dahn et al .",
    "the clearing of clouds at nearly constant t@xmath0 explains the apparent brightening of the early - type t dwarfs at 1 @xmath26 , as the emitting layers below the clouds in these objects would be warmer than the layers above the cloud decks in late - type l dwarfs .",
    "note that there is some intrinsic scatter among the empirical data , likely due to the influence of gravity , rotation , and metallicity on cloud coverageo and/or ch@xmath19 absorption features , resulting in later - type spectral morphologies and photometric colors for a given t@xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon would not explain the rapid l / t transition , however , again due to the lack of strong h@xmath17 emission in either sdss j1254 - 0122 or 2mass j0559 - 1404 , as well as the very low photospheric magnetic reynolds numbers in these cool , neutral atmospheres @xcite . ] . nonetheless , the apparently sudden color transition from l to t clearly can not be explained by the progressive sinking of a uniform cloud deck with decreasing @xmath29 , but is possible through the disruption of condensate clouds .",
    "there is additional evidence that light emitted at @xmath30 by early and mid - type t dwarfs is seen through opening holes in condensate cloud decks .",
    "figure 2 plots the optical spectra of a series of late - type l and t dwarfs ( kirkpatrick et al .  1999 , 2000 ; burgasser et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , obtained using the low resolution imaging spectrograph @xcite on keck .",
    "spectral types listed are from @xcite and @xcite , and are consistent with a monotonic t@xmath0 sequence @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the region centered at the @xmath31 feh band .",
    "this feature weakens in the later - type l dwarfs , in concert with the observed disappearance of the @xmath32 feh band @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the segregation of liquid iron into condensate clouds , which depletes the atmosphere of iron - bearing gases above the cloud layer . as the clouds settle below the photosphere with decreasing temperature , the amount of detectable feh drops as well",
    "however , the @xmath31 feh band unexpectedly reappears in sdss j1254 - 0122 and is quite pronounced in 2mass j0559 - 1404 .",
    "the retention of feh absorption from late - type l dwarfs to early- and mid - type t dwarfs is a general trend , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the feh band clearly weakens from l4 to l8 , but persists and even strengthens slightly toward type t5.5 , subsequently weakening in the latest t dwarfs .",
    "the plateau in band strength across the l / t transition can not be explained with a cloud deck that gradually sinks below the photosphere with decreasing t@xmath0 . in this case",
    ", we would only see the atmosphere above the cloud deck in which feh is depleted .",
    "however , if holes are present in the clouds , deeper and warmer regions in which feh is not depleted become observable .",
    "these deep layers can be detected at @xmath30 , where @xmath11 , @xmath4 , and @xmath12 absorption is relatively weak .",
    "since the reappearance of feh coincides with the turnover in @xmath18 color , the hypothesis of cloud clearing simultaneously explains both phenomena .",
    "the disruption of condensate clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres likely begins when the cloud deck forms within the atmospheric convection zone and becomes subject to coherent vertical motions . at higher effective temperatures ,",
    "the clouds lie primarily above the radiative - convective boundary and would likely remain spatially uniform , perhaps like the stratospheric hazes on titan and the giant planets .",
    "evidence for vertical transport has already been seen in cool brown dwarfs , with the detection of co absorption at @xmath33 in the t6.5 dwarf gliese 229b @xcite in excess of its equilibrium abundance @xcite .",
    "photometric studies of late - type l and t dwarfs also indicate far greater absorption in the @xmath34 band than predicted by chemical equilibrium models @xcite , likely caused by enhanced co abundances brought up by vertical flows .",
    "since the principal cloud decks lie within 0.5 pressure scale heights of one another , the convective motion need not be particularly vigorous to disrupt all layers . note that upwelling brings substantial co into the photosphere because of its stable bond and hence relatively slow conversion to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the fragility of the feh bond ( 1.63 ev versus 11.09 ev for co ) precludes any similar non - equilibrium enhancement of this species above the cloud layer .",
    "the picture of a brown dwarf s atmospheric evolution presented here has a number of observable consequences .",
    "first , the t@xmath0 scale between the late - type l and early - type t dwarfs should be very narrow ; this has already been surmised by a number of studies @xcite .",
    "a narrow temperature scale also implies fewer early - type t dwarfs than mid- or late - type t dwarfs , given the shorter time a brown dwarf spends in this phase of its thermal evolution .",
    "the statistics are currently insufficient to adequately test this prediction .",
    "we also expect substantial photometric and/or spectroscopic variability in late - type l and early - type t dwarfs , caused by the formation , evolution , and motion ( rotational or wind - driven ) of cloud holes in their upper atmospheres .",
    "such weather phenomena have been previously cited to explain non - periodic variability in late - type m and early - type l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "similar variability could be significant at @xmath30 in the l / t transition .",
    "filling in the color - magnitude sequence of late - type l and early - type t dwarfs will enable us to further characterize the behavior of condensate clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "regardless , the observed spectral and photometric properties of brown dwarfs indicate that the planetary - like phenomena of cloud formation and disruption are important in the evolution of free - floating brown dwarfs .",
