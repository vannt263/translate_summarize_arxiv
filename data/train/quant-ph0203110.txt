    ".    one can develop an @xmath52 matrix formalism in this representation , and extract the l - z rotation from the branching properties of the solution at @xmath69 : indeed at the level crossing the frequency of the motion inverts its sign .",
    "it should be further pointed out that , as long as @xmath59 is quadratic in the spinor amplitudes , its branching behavior is accordingly modified with respect to the spinor case . in appendix ii we give the main steps of the solution .    before going to numerical results , let us summarize the qualitative features of the motion : + a ) in the `` normal '' regime the representative undergoes uniaxial rotations ( precession with time - dependent frequency having an average value of @xmath70 ) ; b ) in the l - z regime a discrete rotation , involving the population as well as the coherences , occurs ; c ) in the next `` normal '' regime the bias @xmath34 has opposite sign with respect to regime ( a ) , so that the sign of precession is inverted in the l - z region .",
    "let us consider the following 3 situations : @xmath71 .    in the first case we have @xmath72",
    ", so that , after crossing , an initially `` magnetized '' state is preserved , apart from a small correction ; in the second case , where the transition probability equals @xmath73 , it is turned into a `` fully unmagnetized '' state ; in the third case @xmath74 , magnetization reversal occurs .",
    "fig.1 is the three - dimensional plot of the representative @xmath75 .",
    "the interlevel coupling @xmath35 is of the order of the frequency @xmath41 .",
    "the l - z crossings can be found in the regions where the trajectory inverts its path . furthermore , at the crossings the vector @xmath75 undergoes a discrete rotation @xmath76 .",
    "the vertical angle @xmath58 is determined by the transition probability between the two levels , which goes as @xmath77 : here , where we started with @xmath78 , one can see that @xmath79 is reduced accordingly at each crossing .    in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath80 is plotted over 10 cycles of the external field .",
    "the fast oscillations correspond to the `` normal '' regime , where @xmath59 is on average constant ; the `` normal '' regimes are separated by kinks , produced by the crossings .    here",
    "we have @xmath81 , as three kinks are needed to reach the complete inversion of @xmath59 . the population @xmath59 ( as well as the coherences @xmath33 ) undergoes large scale oscillations , following the bias frequency .",
    "a planar @xmath82 plot would exhibit similar oscillations associated with @xmath60 .",
    "one could argue that a zero - average oscillating bias @xmath83 must generate a zero - average @xmath80 . on the contrary ,",
    "`` single spin magnetization '' is possible , with hamiltonian dynamics . indeed , by operating on the `` normal '' evolution through @xmath41 , we obtained trajectories where @xmath80 keeps a fixed sign .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "although the l - z rotations always act additively on @xmath75 , if the interposed `` normal '' evolution inverts the planar components , the sequence of the @xmath58 rotations acts on @xmath80 alternatingly rather than additively .    under these conditions if , e.g. , one starts with @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , at the first crossing @xmath59 is raised at @xmath86 , but at the next crossing , it turns back to @xmath78 .",
    "an example is shown in figs . 3 , 4 , 5 , referring to @xmath87 respectively .",
    "in this non - adiabatic regime in general we found strong irreversibility ; the `` symmetry - breaking '' solution instead is almost perfectly reversible .",
    "this is made clear in fig .",
    "5 , where practically no hysteretic effects are found .",
    "when the transition probability equals @xmath88 , the population , when started at @xmath78 , turns into a perfectly balanced superposition of the two levels @xmath89 and the vertical angle is : @xmath90 .",
    "the `` in - phase '' evolution follows the sequence @xmath91 , the `` out - of - phase '' evolution is given by @xmath92 .",
    "the latter case again generates a completely reversible process .    at much larger values of the transition probability",
    "the magnetization aligns to the bias at each step .",
    "the field evolves slowly with respect to the two - level system : we are in the adiabatic regime , and we obtain very small deviations from reversibility in the plots @xmath93 ( not shown here ) .",
    "the simplest non - hermitean generalization of the previous model includes population damping and decoherence .",
    "this leads to an homogeneous equation for @xmath75 :    @xmath94    in compact form , we have @xmath95 .",
    "notice that the isotropic case @xmath96 , apart from a poincar sphere with decaying radius , is identical to the unitary case .",
    "we thus consider the general case .",
    "the large time asymptotics of the solution of eq.[me2 ] can be determined from the eigenvalues @xmath97 of the operator @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "we limit ourselves to few preliminary results , for the sake of simplicity in the uniaxial case : @xmath99 .",
    "the equation for the right eigenvectors @xmath100 reads : @xmath101 it can be shown @xcite that the large time asymptotics is determined by the following fundamental solutions : @xmath102    since here we have @xmath103 , the eigenvalues can be analytically computed .",
    "it is convenient to shift the variable @xmath104:@xmath105 $ ] .",

    "[ equ ] are real - valued .",
    "we keep terms up to the order @xmath109 in the expansion in powers of @xmath47 , and get : @xmath110\\\\ \\gamma_{c}&= & \\delta   ( \\delta^{2 } - { 1 \\over 2 }   \\delta^{2})\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first eigenvalue gives the correction to the damping @xmath111 , while @xmath112 in their real part , give the correction to @xmath113 .",
    "it is worth noticing that these corrections act on @xmath114 and@xmath115 with opposite signs : in other words , decoherence is slowed down at the expense of damping , and viceversa , according with the sign of @xmath116 .",
    "the imaginary parts of @xmath117 , related with the oscillating behavior and with the branching properties around @xmath118 , are not influenced by decoherence and damping .",
    "one verifies that , apart from a factor of @xmath119 , which is expected in going from the spinor amplitude to the vector amplitude , the result coincides with the semiclassical momentum @xmath120 , given after eq .",
    "[ a2 ] .    in the example of fig .",
    "6 we assume pure decoherence in the adiabatic regime : the population @xmath59 follows the bias . notice that indeed @xmath59 is damped as expected from the correction to @xmath111 computed previously(see eq .",
    "[ eigen2 ] , with @xmath121 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , between crossings , sustain an oscillating @xmath59 with an @xmath124 sensitively different from zero .",
    "the symmetry breaking solution , found in the previous section , survives to decoherence , as shown in fig .",
    "we have the conditions of fig . 3 , but the decoherence parameters of fig .",
    "one can realize a `` magnetized '' single spin , by means of an oscillating bias . here",
    "the magnetization is in the direction of the bias field ; the situation discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite is rather different : there the magnetization is orthogonal to the bias and @xmath59 relaxes toward the ground state .    when @xmath125 , in the adiabatic regime , the dominant effect is that the population decay is enhanced and @xmath80 rapidly evolves towards zero .",
    "the incoherent processes in a two - level system include internal transitions ( i.e. interlevel transitions mediated by the surroundings ) .    here",
    "we analize the effects of incoherent relaxation from the upper to the lower level .    at the l - z crossings the ground state flips between the two levels , and",
    "the inhomogeneous term must change its sign accordingly ; we are then led to the inhomogeneous equation :    @xmath126    if one were to choose a sign for the inhomogeneous term in eq .",
    "[ me3 ] , one would describe a situation in which the system would be forced to decay towards a given level .",
    "this is appropriate only provided that @xmath44 has a fixed sign .",
    "the calculations presented in fig . 8",
    ", 9 refer to the adiabatic , strongly damped regime .",
    "the population @xmath59 starts switching from a `` magnetized '' state to the opposite one , exactly when the external field changes its sign .",
    "the escape from the instability is markedly different from the relaxation towards the stable ground state ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , but this is not the origin of the hysteretic behavior shown in fig . 8 .    in the approach towards a fully `` magnetized '' state , the coupling between @xmath59 and the coherences @xmath33 plays a relevant role ( see the oscillanting branches in the hysteresis cycle ) .",
    "when the bias retraces its path backwards , the system is already in a fully `` magnetized '' state @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "only the onset of the instability , as the bias changes its sign , is able to put the system in motion again .    in conclusion",
    ", we have two regimes ( incoherent @xmath129 and coherent @xmath130 respectively ) both compatible with the same value of the bias .",
    "so far we discussed a situation where the period @xmath131 is much larger than the decay times of the two - level system , so that the external field can be considered as quasi - static . as the decay time gets longer , the system does not relax fast enough towards the `` fully magnetized '' state : an hysteretic behavior survives , as shown in fig . 10 .",
    "we conclude this section with a last example : we added the relaxation towards the ground state to the system discussed in fig . 7 ; the frequency @xmath41 is comparable with @xmath35 .    in fig .",
    "11 , the fastly oscillating portions refer to the `` normal '' evolution , and the kinks to the crossings .",
    "notice that the oscillating parts are attracted towards the `` fully magnetized '' state , which is never reached .",
    "the system shows an hysteretic limit cycle ( see fig .",
    "we examined the time evolution of a two - level system in the presence of an oscillating external field , both in the unitary case and with decoherence and dissipation .",
    "we solved , in this context , the landau - zener problem in the density matrix formalism , and showed that , in the frequency representation , the population @xmath67 satisfies a schrdinger equation for an inverted harmonic oscillator in d=2 .",
    "we indicated a procedure allowing to interpret the various dynamical regimes by means of few intuitive rules .",
    "we found that it is possible to sustain a magnetization parallel to the bias for the single spin .",
    "we became recently aware of related work @xcite , where instead the spin is magnetized in the direction orthogonal to the bias ; furthermore , while our result holds in the homogeneous case , in ref .",
    "@xcite relaxation towards a single level is assumed .",
    "we have also shown that one can explicitly solve the landau - zener problem in the non - unitary case , by means of a suitable extension of wkb methods .",
    "we stress that in our approach the parameters of the equation are completely arbitrary , so that no `` adiabatic elimination '' of fast variables is needed @xcite .",
    "we find that the corrections to @xmath111 and @xmath113 have opposite sign .",
    "the branching properties of the solution are not modified with respect to the unitary case : the scattering matrix is again a function of the single l - z parameter @xmath54 .",
    "when decay from the upper to the lower level is taken into account , we find hysteretic behavior : this effect originates in the coexistence of a fully magnetized state , where the coherences @xmath33 are strictly zero , and a partly magnetized state , with nonzero coherences .",
    "this interpretation holds in the overdamped case ; at slower dampings an hysteretic limit cycle survives , related with non - adiabatic effects .",
    "the conditions for complete positivity of the evolution , when written for matrix @xmath7 , are : @xmath132    together with :    @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136    @xmath137 \\,+\\ ,   ( \\gamma_{3 } \\,+\\ , \\gamma_{2 } \\,-\\ , \\gamma_{1 } ) ( \\gamma^{2 } \\,+\\ ,   \\frac{1}{4}\\ , c_{1}^{2})\\ ] ] in our problem we further must take into account @xmath34 , which defines the scale of times , and @xmath35 .",
    "thus @xmath35 is the single relevant parameter of the model .",
    "in this appendix we summarize the main points of the solution of the l - z problem , as obtained by starting from the master equation ; we omit those details that can be easily implemented from the standard solution .    in the non - dissipative case",
    "the landau - zener problem is written in the form :    @xmath138    the variable @xmath123 can be eliminated from the third equation , and one obtains : @xmath139    let us define the new variable @xmath140 ; it is readily verified , by inspecting the second equation in system [ lzunitary2 ] , that from @xmath141 one can recover the entire solution : @xmath142 .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath143 solves the equation : @xmath144 let us write @xmath2 as : @xmath145    we find that the function @xmath146 , which , apart from a constant factor , is the fourier transform of the population @xmath147 , satisfies the whittaker equation @xcite : @xmath148    notice that eq .",
    "[ whittaker ] has the form of a schrdinger equation for the inverted harmonic oscillator in d=2 , with `` angular momentum '' @xmath149 ; ( clearly in our case @xmath66 varies over the whole axis ) .",
    "the equation can be written in the canonical form of the hypergeometric confluent equation ( hce ) by letting : @xmath150 .    in terms of the new variable @xmath151 , one finally gets , for the function @xmath152 : @xmath153    two linearly independent solutions , respectively regular at infinity and around zero ,",
