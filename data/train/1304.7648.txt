    "the following arpes data provide evidence that under this doping it is possible to alter the band structure and tune the fermi level towards the dirac point .",
    "fig.[fig3](a ) shows the arpes measurements of five different compounds starting with the undoped sample gebi@xmath0te@xmath1 up to gebi@xmath12sbte@xmath1 ( @xmath6 ) . comparing the first two data sets , the undoped sample and the lightly doped sample ( @xmath31 ) , the dirac point as well as the position of the bulk vb shifted slightly towards the fermi level .",

    "the position of the cb minima at normal emission an the vb maxima at @xmath22  @xmath23 were located the same way as shown in fig.[fig1](e ) for x=0 , 0.4 , 0.6 and 0.8 .",
    "the relative energetic positions of these points in the different band structures are plotted with respect to the sb content in fig.[fig3](c ) , using the dirac point as the reference . in fig.[fig3](c ) we see , that the position of the broad vb feature at normal emission with respect to the dirac point is a linear function of the sb content . with an extrapolation of this linear function to @xmath6 the position of the vb at normal emission and accordingly the position of the dirac point located at @xmath32  mev above the fermi level can be distinguished for this compound . comparing this position with the energetic position of the dirac point at @xmath27  mev for gebi@xmath33te@xmath1 , a band structure shift of @xmath34  mev over the whole doping range",
    "is observed .",
    "the energetic position of the vb maxima and the cb minima relative to the dirac point change linearly with the sb content as well ( see fig.[fig3](c ) ) . by the help of fitted linear functions",
    "the energetic positions of the vb maxima and the cb minima for gebi@xmath12sbte@xmath1 can be extrapolated ( see fig.[fig3](c ) ) .",
    "the binding energy of the dirac point as a function of the sb content is fitted with a sigmoid function providing a fermi level crossing at a doping level of @xmath35 ( see fig.[fig3](e ) ) , accompanied by a _",
    "n_- to _ p_-type transition of the surface transport regime .",

    "we observe a sign change and consequently a change of the transport regime at a doping of @xmath4 at 30 k where the arpes measurements were done , as well as at room temperature ( see fig.[fig3](d ) ) .",
    "this discrepancy between the _",
    "n_- to _ p_-type transition measured at the surface and in the bulk can be explained by band bending at the sample surface , commonly known in semiconductor physics as an effect of the surface states or defect induced as observed for bi@xmath11se@xmath12.@xcite . at a doping of @xmath4 , where the bulk _",
    "n_- to _ p_-type transition takes place we expect the band gap center of the bulk at the fermi level . by the help of the position of the band gap center measured in the surface region for a doping of @xmath4 ( see fig.[fig3](e ) , dashed grey line ) the downwards bending of the bands at the surface can be estimated to be 170  mev ( difference between the band gap center in the surface region and in the bulk ) .",
    "the measured band gap marked in figs .",
    "[ fig3](c ) and ( e ) by the white region decreases linearly with sb doping .",
    "the band gap of the undoped sample of @xmath36  mev is narrowing to @xmath37  mev for gebi@xmath12sbte@xmath1 if the positions of the cb minima and vb maxima are extrapolated .",
    "this narrowing of the band gap is explained by the lower atomic number of sb compared to bi leading to a weaker spin  orbit coupling which is responsible for the energy splitting of the bands enclosing the gap .",
    "based on this narrowing we expect to observe the fermi level inside the band gap in arpes measurements for a doping between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the observed band gap of the undoped sample is of the order of the band bending at the surface and for doped samples between @xmath4 and @xmath6 the band gap is even smaller than the band bending , assuming a constant band bending for all doping levels .",
    "accordingly there can be no doping where a insulating bulk occurs simultaneously with a insulating surface region .    to gain further understanding of the mechanism responsible for the band shift under sb doping the compositions of the samples",
    "were investigated by x ",
    "ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) .",
    "xps data in the energy region of the te 4d , sb 4d , ge 3d and bi 5d core levels measured with a photon energy of @xmath40ev are shown in fig.[fig4](a ) . in first order approximation",
    "we assume that the sb and bi atoms are distributed in the same atomic layers . under these conditions",
    "the ratio of sb to bi is given by the peak intensities of the sb 4d and bi 5d core levels weighted by the respective cross sections ( see fig.[fig4](b ) ) .",
    "the measured ratios show a linear behavior , although their value is lower than expected from the stoichiometric composition . in xps measurements",
    "the inelastic scattering length of the emitted electrons depends on the position of the emitting atom in the crystal .",
    "because the exact positions of the sb and bi atoms in the crystal with respect to the surface and to each other is unknown , the modulation of the xps intensities due to inelastic scattering is not known precisely which may explain the difference between the measured and the stoichiometric ratio .",
    "( b ) sb / bi ratio determined from the measurements , the dashed red line is a straight line fitted to the data .",
    "the dashed blue line shows the stoichiometric ratio of the samples.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the dopant sb has the same valency as bi , and thus it acts neither as an acceptor nor as a donor compared to bi in gebi@xmath2sb@xmath3te@xmath1 .",
    "therefore the change in band filling as a function of increasing sb content is not caused by carrier doping but rather by the type of defects caused by the bi / sb replacement .",
    "calculations of the formation energies of the prototype case of ( bi@xmath41sb@xmath3)@xmath11te@xmath12 by @xcite show that in the undoped bi@xmath11te@xmath12 sample te vacancies and te@xmath42 antisite defects ( bi replaced by te ) are dominant and are supporting the @xmath43-type conductance of the compound . with increasing sb content",
    "these defects are energetically less favorable but the building of sb@xmath44 antisite defects is preferred . with less te@xmath42 and more sb@xmath44 antisite defects the system becomes @xmath45-type . due to the similarities of this system with gebi@xmath2sb@xmath3te@xmath1",
    "we expect the same type of defects to be responsible for the observed @xmath43- to @xmath45-type transition.@xcite the additional role of ge related antisite defects could be the aim of further theoretical investigations .",
    "the calculation of @xcite demonstrates also that a small change in the sample growth procedure , providing more energy during the sample formation , can open the possibility that other defects with higher formation energy may form .",
    "this as well as the sensitivity of the system to small stoichiometric changes @xcite is why a highly controlled sample preparation procedure with identical parameters for all the different doping levels is mandatory to reproducibly observe this change in electronic structure .",
    "we also studied samples of poorer quality who show overall features similar to what we report here , but the smooth transition of the position of the dirac point through the fermi energy as a function of sb content is obscured by sample inhomogeneity .",
    "we present ( s)arpes data of the multi  layered material gebi@xmath0te@xmath1 and a study of the change of the band structure under doping with sb to gebi@xmath2sb@xmath3te@xmath1 .",
    "our data allocates spin ",
    "polarized surface states forming a freestanding dirac point in the band gap of gebi@xmath0te@xmath1 . upon sb doping",
    "we find a rigid shift of the band structure and the dirac point crossing the fermi level between a doping of @xmath5 and @xmath6 giving the possibility to change the surface transport regime from _",
    "n_- to _ p_-type by doping .",
    "responsible for the observed band shift is the introduction of different types of defects in the crystal structure under sb doping .",
    "n_- to _ p_-type transition observed in surface sensitive arpes is clearly distinct from the transition in the bulk , visible in seebeck coefficient measurements at @xmath4 . combining these two measurements we are able to distinguish a band bending of 170  mev at the sample surface .",
    "the concluded non  coexistence of a insulating phase in the near surface region and in the bulk demonstrates the importance of the combination of bulk and surface sensitive measurements to get materials with a fermi level in the band gap to access the topological surface states directly in transport measurements .",
