    "2.0 recently , non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma ) technique is widely considered as a promising multiple access ( ma ) candidate for 5 g mobile networks due to its superior spectral efficiency @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the key idea of noma is to explore the power domain for realizing ma , where different users are served at different power levels @xcite and @xcite .",
    "consequently , the impact of different choices of power allocation coefficients has been studied in @xcite , where the authors considered the fairness of the user for noma systems . under the total transmit power constraint and the minimum rate constraint of the weak user , the ergodic capacity maximization problem for multiple - input multiple - output",
    "( mimo ) noma systems has been solved @xcite .",
    "in addition , the implementation of noma with two base stations ( bss ) has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the authors derived the sum rates ( srs ) for noma schemes with superposition coding ( sc ) that does not require instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) at bss . on this basis , the work of noma in the coordinated direct and relay transmission ( cdrt ) has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the authors proposed the cooperative relaying system ( crs ) using noma , and presented the exact and asymptotic expressions for the achievable rate of the proposed system in independent rayleigh fading channels .",
    "nevertheless , the achievable rate is limited by the source - to - destination link which leading to the loss of the system performance .    to solve this problem , we propose a two - stage power allocation crs using noma in this paper . in our proposed scheme ,",
    "once mrc at the destination and twice power allocations at the source and the relay are employed . to further improve the performance of the ergodic sr of our proposed scheme and the existing work @xcite",
    ", the destination will not immediately decode the reception from the source until it receives the superposition coded signal from the relay .",
    "we focus on the analysis of the achievable ergodic sr for our proposed scheme , and the closed - form expression at snr region is then derived .",
    "in addition , to maximize the ergodic sr , a practical two - stage power allocation strategy is designed .",
    "numerical results are presented to corroborate the derived theoretical analysis , and show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the ergodic sr compared to the one in @xcite .",
    "the dual - hop relay system with two - stage power allocation.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    a simple crs consisting of one source , one relay , and one destination is shown in fig .",
    "1 . we assume all nodes operate in half - duplex mode and the direct link between the source and the destination exists .",
    "the channels from the source to the destination , from the source to the relay , and from the relay to the destination are denoted as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively , which are assumed to be independent complex gaussian random variables with variances @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively . in our proposed scheme ,",
    "each transmission involves two time slots . at the first time slot , assuming the adoption of the superposition code , the signal @xmath6 is simultaneously transmitted from the source to the relay and the destination , where @xmath7 , i=1,2 , denote the broadcasted symbols at the source , @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 are the power allocation factors , and @xmath11 stands for the total transmit power .",
    "the received signal at the source and the relay are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 represent the additive white gaussian noises ( awgns ) with zero mean and variance @xmath14 .",
    "to successfully and simultaneously decode @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the relay , we further assume that the path loss and shadowing effects for @xmath0 are worse than those for @xmath1 , which leading the ordinary channel condition as @xmath17 . by treating @xmath16 as noise to decode @xmath15 , and then using the sic to acquire @xmath16",
    ", the relay can efficiently decode @xmath15 and @xmath16 from during one time slot . by this way",
    ", the snrs for @xmath18 and @xmath19 at the relay can be respectively expressed as @xmath20 note that different from @xcite , to improve the system performance , the destination will not decode the received signal from the source but instead conserves it until the second time slot comes .    at the second time slot",
    ", the relay node forwards a new symbol @xmath21 with sc to the destination : @xmath22 where @xmath11 is the total transmit power , @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 are new power allocation coefficients .",
    "therefore , the received signal at the destination can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the awgn at the destination with zero mean and variance @xmath14 . from above",
    ", we see that there are two signals received at the destination , which are @xmath28 and @xmath29 . to jointly decode @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the destination",
    ", we employ @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
