    "instabilities can result in strongly variable and unstable accretion rates .",
    "@xcite discovered the so - called dynamical runaway instability ( ri ) in thick , self - gravitating accretion disks around bhs .",
    "the ri is similar to the dynamical instability in close binary systems that occurs when the more massive binary member overflows its roche lobe . in this case",
    ", the size of the roche lobe decreases faster than the size of the binary companion , which can ultimately lead to the tidal disruption of the companion and the merger of the binary system . in disks around bhs",
    ", a toroidal surface analogous to the roche lobe can be identified .",
    "a meridional cut of this surface exhibits a cusp located at the @xmath0 lagrange point .",
    "if the disk overflows this toroidal roche surface , then the mass - transfer through the cusp will push the cusp outwards , making a larger fraction of the disk matter unstable to accretion .",
    "this drives the cusp out even further , and leads to an exponential growth of the mass - transfer rate . as a result ,",
    "most of the disk gets consumed by the bh within just a few dynamical times .",
    "@xcite found that the development of the ri depends on a wide range of parameters , such as the disk - to - bh mass ratio @xmath1 and the location of the inner edge of the disk .",
    "however , their investigation was based on several approximations and simplifications : they used a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) for the disk material , a pseudo - newtonian potential to model gravity of bh  @xcite , a disk with constant specific angular momentum , and an approximate treatment of the self - gravity of the disk .",
    "subsequent works with more refined approximations found indications of a stabilizing effect due to bh rotation  @xcite , while a positive radial gradient of specific angular momentum was suggested to strongly suppress the instability  @xcite .",
    "moreover , studies using a newtonian pseudopotential for the gravity of the bh  @xcite and relativistic calculations in a fixed spacetime background   found that the self - gravity of the disk aggravates the instability . nevertheless , the distance between the inner edge of the disk and the location of the cusp is probably the most crucial parameter for the development of the ri : for as long as it is too large , the ri is unlikely to occur .",
    "recently , @xcite performed the first fully general relativistic simulations of thick accretion disks around bhs in axisymmetry for a few dynamical times .",
    "for the particular models they studied , they found no signature of a ri during the simulated time .",
    "however , the inner surface of their disk models was located away from the roche surfaces ( p.  montero , private communication ) , so that the instability might not have had sufficiently favourable conditions or sufficient time to develop within the time period of disk evolution that was considered .",
    "therefore , their results do not rule out the existence of the ri in disk models where the inner edge is located closer to the cusp .    in @xcite , some of us have analyzed the stability of slender and moderately slender accretion disks around bhs with @xmath2 in the range of ( 0.11 , 0.24 ) using three - dimensional ( 3d ) numerical simulations in full general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "although we did observe the development of several non - axisymmetric instabilities in our models , we found no traces of the ri .",
    "this result is , perhaps , not surprising since the inner radii of our disk models were located significantly away from the roche surface ( see @xcite for more details ) .    in a similar study , @xcite performed simulations of self - gravitating disks around bhs in full gr with the aim of obtaining the gravitational wave signal from the non - axisymmetric papaloizou - pringle instability .",
    "they considered four disk models with constant and non - constant specific angular momentum and disk - to - bh mass ratios of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "no runaway instability was observed in their simulations , but no information was given regarding the relative location of the inner edge of the disk and the roche surface .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to judge if their models were sufficiently susceptible to develop the ri .    in order to understand whether the ri can occur at all in the most general case ,",
    "one first has to expore whether it can develop in configurations that are _ particularly prone _ to the instability .",
    "such systems contain disks that exactly fill their roche lobes , have significant fractions of the bh masses , constant specific angular momentum profiles and non - rotating bhs .",
    "it is left to future studies to explore under which circumstances such configurations would form in nature .",
    "our aim here is to explore whether the ri can occur _ in principle _ if the fully dynamical general - relativistic effects are taken into account properly .",
    "our 3d general relativistic simulations indeed confirm that the ri occurs in these cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : numericalmethods ] , we describe the numerical methods used in our simulations . in section  [ s :",
    "diskmodels ] , we describe the initial disk model . in section  [ s : results ] , we present our results , and in section  [ s : conclusion ] present our conclusions for future work . unless otherwise noted , throughout the paper we measure distances in the units of the schwarzschild radius @xmath5 of the black hole at @xmath6 , while the rest of the quantities are measured in cgs units .",
    "the numerical time - evolution in our study is performed with the gr hydrodynamics code  @xcite and the spacetime evolution code  @xcite .",
    "these two codes are based on and communicate with each other via the open - source computational infrastructure  @xcite , and use the mesh refinement and multiblock driver  @xcite .",
    "initial models of self - gravitating disks around bhs are constructed using an improved version of the code  @xcite .",
    "we use a multiblock grid with an adapted resolution which is similar to the one used in  @xcite .",
    "the grid resolution is @xmath7 near the bh , @xmath8 at the disk density maximum , and @xmath9 at the outer boundary . for more details of the numerical methods as well as the grid structure used in our simulations ,",

    "contours of the pressure are equally spaced by @xmath17 in decimal logarithmic scale , starting from the maximum pressure ( green dot on the @xmath18-axis ) .",

    "the disk fills the roche lobe almost up to the cusp .",

    "we do not include additional physics such as magnetic fields , nuclear or neutrino processes .",
    "therefore , the results can be rescaled using one free parameter such as the initial bh mass .",
    "in particular , the cgs parameters listed in table  [ t : modelparams ] assume @xmath23 .",

    "[ f : id ] corresponds to the roche surface , while the green ones show the contours of constant pressure .",
    "the disk in model a fills its roche lobe almost entirely , with a remaining gap in the effective potential between the inner edge of the disk and the cusp of only @xmath27 .",

    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ f : diskbhmassam ] shows the time evolution of the cusp radius and the radial coordinate of the location of the maximum disk density @xmath31 . due to initial metric perturbations induced by matching the initial data to a vacuum bh metric near the horizon ( cf .",
    "discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the bh mass and cusp radius settle to a new , @xmath32  smaller value within @xmath33 .",
    "the smaller gravitational pull of the bh leads to a rapid increase of @xmath31 by @xmath34 within the same time interval .",
    "since the cusp is now located at a smaller radius , the disk is less likely to become subject to the ri .",
    "however , the initial metric perturbations induce oscillations in the disk , which are particularly evident in the evolution of @xmath31 at @xmath35 .",
    "these oscillations lead to occasional crossing of the roche lobe by the disk , resulting in a steady and slow accretion of the disk material onto the bh at @xmath36 .",
    "this is visible in the evolution of the disk mass and angular momentum shown in the center panel of fig .  [",
    "f : diskbhmassam ] .",
    "the radius @xmath31 gradually decreases due to this slow accretion up to the time when the inner disk radius becomes as small as the cusp radius .",
    "this occurs at @xmath37 . at that point ,",
    "the cusp radius starts increasing , leading to an acceleration of the accretion . by the end of our simulation ( @xmath38 ) ,",
    "@xmath39 of the initial disk mass has been accreted onto the bh .",
    "such an accelerated accretion due to dynamical migration of the cusp towards the disk during which most of the disk material is swallowed by the bh is exactly the defining property of the runaway instability .",
    "thus , our simulations show that the ri can indeed occur , at least for the most susceptible models , which are considered here .",
    "it is interesting to note that the development of the axisymmetric runaway instability triggers non - axisymmetric deformations of the disk .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ f : diskbhmassam ] shows the normalized amplitude of non - axisymmetric @xmath29 deformations ( see @xcite for the exact definition of the amplitude ) . the @xmath30 deformation grows exponentially starting at @xmath40 until @xmath41 , reaches its peak value of @xmath42 , at which point it saturates .",
    "this deformation develops due to the so - called papaloizou and pringle instability ( ppi )  @xcite , enhanced by an eccentric motion of the bh  ( as described in * ? ? ?",
    "the deformations corresponding to the other values of @xmath43 do not show a strong growth and remain below @xmath44 . since both the ppi and ri develop roughly at the same time in our simulations , they could , in principle , interact nonlinearly , when sufficiently large amplitudes are reached .",
    "in particular , the ppi - induced deformations might be responsible for the apparent saturation of the ri towards the end of our simulations .",
    "such deformations redistribute angular momentum outwards , which , in turn , inhibits the development of the ri  @xcite ( while another factor responsible for the eventual saturation of the ri is , of course , the depletion of the disk mass ) .",
    "nevertheless , the rather moderate amplitude of the @xmath30 mode of @xmath42 is unlikely to drastically affect the evolution of the ri , especially during the early evolution .",
    "neither can it be held responsible for the onset of the ri itself , since the accretion stream overflowing the cusp and triggering the ri is only slightly non - axisymmetric . a more detailed analysis of the non - linear interaction between the ppi and the ri is required to clarify its role .",
    "figure  [ f : colorframes ] shows four snapshots of the disk density in the meridional plane , for model a , corresponding to the times @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the snapshot at @xmath49 shows the disk in a perturbed state after the passage of the initial metric perturbation . as the disk moves away from the bh",
    ", several surface waves can be seen propagating to the outer side of the disk in an axisymmetric manner . as noted above",
    ", such waves have sufficiently high amplitude to overfill the roche lobe and support a small amount of accretion .",
    "the next snapshot at @xmath50 shows a wider accretion stream and an extended structure of the outer parts of the disk , caused by heating by the shocks formed during the radial disk oscillations .",
    "such shock heating efficiently damps out the radial disk oscillation and causes the disk to heat up and expand , similarly to what was observed in  @xcite .",
    "this thermal expansion is confined to the outer regions of the disk .",
    "indeed , if the expansion significantly affected the inner regions , the disk would overflow its roche lobe and additional streams from the upper and lower faces would emerge . since this is not observed on  [ f : colorframes ] , we conclude that the inner side of the disk is not affected .",
    "the last two snapshots show the disk during the rapid accretion phase at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "by @xmath52 , the accretion stream is very wide , but the high - density parts have moved closer to the black hole and occupy a smaller volume , indicating a smaller disk mass .    to secure our findings against the possibility of an error in the treatment of hydrodynamics , we have complemented the fully dynamical gr simulation of model a with one in the cowling approximation ( i.e. , on a fixed metric background ) .",
    "such a model should undergo at most a slow and steady accretion , in a way similar to the early ( @xmath35 ) evolution of the fully dynamical model .",
    "there should be no unstable growth of accretion on a fixed metric background . as we can see from the time evolution of the disk mass and angular momentum shown in the center panel of fig .",
    "[ f : diskbhmassam ] , this is indeed the case .",
    "interestingly , model a does not develop the ppi in our cowling simulation , where amplitudes of non - axisymmetric deformations remain below @xmath53 throughout the evolution . since the ppi in cowling approximation relies on the existence of the non - accreting inner edge of the disk  @xcite , the absence of ppi is probably caused by the accretion at a small rate through the cusp , which can completely freeze the development of ppi modes in cowling approximation  @xcite .",
    "this is different in the case of a dynamical metric , where the ppi can be enhanced by the motion of the bh  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , accretion fails to suppress the ppi in model a with a dynamical metric ( this is also observed in fig .  1 of @xcite for the models with constant specific angular momentum ) .",
    "compared to model a , in model b the disk overflows its roche lobe by a small amount @xmath54 . in this case , the exponential accretion should commence immediately and continue until a significant fraction of the disk is accreted onto the bh within a few dynamical times .",
    "this is what we observe in our simulation , as can be seen from the evolution of the disk mass and angular momentum shown in the center panel of fig .",
    "[ f : diskbhmassam ] .",
    "notice , however , that in this case the development of the instability happens more slowly , because of the lower disk - to - bh mass ratio .",
    "the amplitude of non - axisymmetric deformations is also lower . in particular",
    ", the @xmath30 mode exhibits slow and irregular growth and stays below @xmath55 throughout the simulation ( cf . the center panel of fig .",
    "[ f : diskbhmassam ] ) . in the absence of any significant non - axisymmetic deformation",
    ", the accretion of a substantial fraction of the disk mass onto the bh within a few dynamical times can only be attributed to the development of the ri .    as mentioned in section  [",
    "s : intro ] , @xcite presented axisymmetric simulations of two disk models around bhs with a constant specific angular momentum .",
    "their simulations were also fully general relativistic with dynamical spacetime evolution , similar to our simulations .",
    "the absence of the ri in @xcite must be attributed to differences in the initial disk models ( compared to our configurations ) and specifically to the fact that their initial models did not exactly fill the roche lobe . because of this , the instability is less likely to occur within the limited simulation time .",
    "the same argument may explain the absence of the ri in  @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , this would further underline the importance of the distance between the cusp and the inner disk surface for the development of ri .",
    "in this study , we have , for the first time , demonstrated that the runaway instability in self - gravitating accretion disks does indeed occur in fully dynamical general relativistic evolutions .",
    "we have selected two models that are particularly prone to the development of such an instability .",
    "our models have an appreciable disk - to - bh mass ratio ( @xmath56 for model a and @xmath57 for model b , see table  [ t : modelparams ] ) , a constant profile of specific angular momentum and a non - rotating bh .",
    "moreover , and perhaps most importantly for the development of the runaway instability , our disk model a almost exactly fills its roche lobe , while model b slightly overfills it .",
    "our simulations show that both models develop the runaway instability , exhibiting unstable accretion of the disk matter onto the bh within just a few dynamical times .",
    "more than half of the disk mass is absorbed by the bh by the end of our simulations , which were terminated only because we ran out of available computing time .",
    "our results demonstrate that the runaway instability does indeed occur , at least in the models considered here .",
    "future research will need to investigate how this depends on the parameters of the initial disk models , such as the disk - to - bh mass ratio , the gradient of the specific angular momentum of the disk , and the bh spin , in order to establish the astrophysical significance of the instability .",
