    "slow viscous and incompressible simultaneous flow through an unconfined region and a porous medium occurs in a wide range of industrial processes and natural phenomena .",
    "one of the classical problems is finding effective boundary conditions at a naturally permeable wall , i.e. , at the surface which separates a channel flow and a porous medium .",
    "the effective laminar incompressible and viscous flow through a porous medium can be described using the darcy s law .",
    "the unconfined fluid flow in the channel is governed by the stokes system , or by the navier - stokes system if the inertia effects in the free fluid are important .",
    "to model the coupling of both processes , it is necessary to put together two systems of partial differential equations : the second order system for the velocity and the first order equation for the pressure , @xmath0 in the unconfined fluid region , and the scalar second order equation for the pressure and the first order system for the seepage velocity , @xmath1 in the porous medium .",
    "the orders of the corresponding differential operators are different and it is not clear what conditions it is necessary to impose at the interface between the free fluid and the porous part of the domain .",
    "one coupling condition is based on the continuity of the normal mass flux . however , it is not enough for determination of the effective flow and it is necessary to specify more conditions .",
    "several laws of fluid dynamics in porous media were derived using homogenization .",
    "the most notable example is the darcy s law , being the effective equation for one phase flow through a rigid porous medium .",
    "its formal derivation using the 2-scale expansion goes back to the classical paper by ene and sanchez - palencia @xcite .",
    "this derivation was made mathematically rigorous by tartar in reference @xcite .",
    "for the detailed proof in the case of a periodic porous medium we refer to the review papers by allaire @xcite , and by mikeli @xcite and for a random statistically homogeneous porous medium to the paper of beliaev and kozlov @xcite .    as in the derivation of darcy s law",
    ", we would like to apply the homogenization technique to find the effective interface laws .",
    "however , the assumption of statistical homogeneity of the domain , which is necessary for the homogenization approach , is not valid close to the interface .",
    "consequently , deviations from the darcy s law are expected in the thin layers near the interfaces .",
    "furthermore , presence of such interfaces can significantly change the structure of the model coefficients and lead to different effective constitutive laws for the flow .",
    "it was experimentally found by beavers and joseph in @xcite that the jump of the tangential component of the effective velocity at the interface is proportional to the shear stress originating from the free fluid .",
    "this law was justified at a physics level of rigor by saffman in @xcite , where it was observed that the seepage velocity contribution could be neglected leading to the law in the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a dimensionless parameter depending on the geometrical structure of the porous medium , @xmath4 is the characteristic pore size , and @xmath5 is the scalar permeability .",
    "@xmath6 denotes the unit normal vector at the interface and @xmath7 is the slip velocity of the free fluid in the channel .",
    "saffman s modification of the law by beavers and joseph has been widely accepted .    as an alternative to ( [ aux ] ) ,",
    "the continuity of the effective pressure was suggested by ene and sanchez - palencia in @xcite .",
    "while this interface law is acceptable from modeling point of view , it should be noted that the well - posedness of the averaged problem is not clear .    the law ( [ aux ] )",
    "was rigorously justified by jger and mikeli in @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations of the boundary layers for the experimental conditions of beavers and joseph are presented in @xcite .",
    "they indicate appearance of a _ pressure jump _ at the interface .",
    "these issues were heuristically discussed in @xcite .    in the experiment by beavers and joseph",
    "only the flows tangential to a naturally permeable wall ( a porous bed ) were considered . in general , the situation is much more complicated and many types of interfacial conditions have been proposed , such as continuous tangential velocity with discontinuous tangential shear stress introduced in @xcite by ochoa - tapia and whitaker , or continuous tangential velocity and tangential shear stress in reference @xcite by neale and nader , or discontinuous tangential velocity and tangential shear stress from @xcite by cieszko and kubik . in particular , in @xcite the continuity of the velocity and the continuity of the `` modified '' normal stress were obtained at the interface using volume averaging . in order to perform the",
    "averaging it was necessary to assume the brinkman s flow in the porous part and a transition layer between the two domains .",
    "numerical study of the hydrodynamic boundary condition at the interface between a porous and plain medium was performed by sahraoui and kaviany @xcite .",
    "numerical implementation of the effective interface couplings was presented in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , determination of the practical and relevant first - order interface conditions between the pure fluid and the porous matrix remains an open question that could be treated using the technique developed in reference @xcite .",
    "this paper is a continuation of works @xcite and @xcite and constitutes a step forward in the development of the rigorous approach to model effective interface laws for the transport phenomena between an unconfined fluid and a porous medium .",
    "we depart beyond justification of the law ( [ aux ] ) developed in @xcite and _ undertake a rigorous derivation _ of the interface laws for the viscous flow in a long channel in contact with a porous bed .",
    "the macroscopic model derived links pressure jump with the shear stress of the unconfined fluid at the interface , an effect which was predicted based on numerical simulations in reference @xcite .",
    "derivation of the law of beavers and joseph is based on the procedures proposed in @xcite and discussed in @xcite ; however it is nontrivially adjusted to the new setting involving a general body force .",
    "we consider a general situation when the flow in the unconfined region dominates .",
    "nevertheless , even if the flow is much less important in the porous part , the pressures are of the same order of magnitude . hence finding and justifying",
    "the interface law for the pressure is of fundamental interest .",
    "the review paper @xcite was concluded with the sentence `` proving the error estimate for the pressure approximation in the porous bed @xmath8 remains an open problem '' .",
    "we solve this problem and present a mathematically rigorous derivation of the pressure jump interface law , which is the next order correction of the beavers - joseph law .",
    "we obtain the effective equations heuristically and then rigorously justify them",
    ". combination of homogenization and boundary layer approaches is used to achieve this end .",
    "study of such complex flows leads to artificial compressibility effects in the upscaling process . in this paper",
    "we develop the required estimate of the pressure .",
    "our main results are the following :    1 .   confirmation of saffman s form of the law by beavers and joseph in the more general setting @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the average over the characteristic pore opening at the naturally permeable wall .",
    "physical permeability is given by @xmath11 and the constant in ( [ bj1 ] ) is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "the error is of order @xmath13 , as remarked by saffman in @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that the parameter @xmath14 from expression ( [ aux ] ) is determined taking into account the auxiliary problems , which we formulate later in ( [ bj4.2])-([4.6 ] ) and ( [ 4.15 ] ) , and that it is given by @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   interface between the unconfined flow and the porous bed is an artificial mathematical boundary and it can be chosen in a layer having the pore size thickness .",
    "we show that a perturbation of the interface position of the order @xmath16 implies a perturbation in the solution of @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , it influences the result only at the next order of the asymptotic expansion .",
    "we obtain a uniform bound on the pressure approximation .",
    "furthermore , we prove that there is a jump of the effective pressure on the interface and that it is proportional to the free fluid flow shear at the boundary .",
    "the proportionality constant is calculated from the boundary layer problem ( [ bj4.2])-([4.6 ] ) .",
    "homogenization leads to the discontinuity of the effective pressure field at the interface , which differs from the pressure interface continuity law proposed in reference @xcite .",
    "if the boundary layer pressure is neglected , the pressure in the neighborhood of the interface is poorly approximated .    here",
    ", we remark that some classes of problems , like infiltration into the porous medium , are characterized by the velocity field of the same order in both domains .",
    "such situation requests much larger body force in the porous part than in unconfined .",
    "some situations of this kind were considered in @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the body force is of order @xmath18 in both domains .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ statpb ]",
    "we formulate the problem and main results .",
    "section [ bjsec ] is devoted to the proof of the results .",
    "we conclude the paper with two short appendices recalling the notion of very weak solutions and definition and properties of the navier boundary layer .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be positive real numbers .",
    "we consider a two dimensional periodic porous medium @xmath21 with a periodic arrangement of the pores .",
    "the formal description goes along the following lines : first , we define the geometrical structure inside the unit cell @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 ( the solid part ) be a closed strictly included subset of @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ( the fluid part ) .",
    "now we make a periodic repetition of @xmath23 all over @xmath26 and set @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "obviously , the resulting set @xmath29 is a closed subset of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in an open set in @xmath30 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath23 has a boundary of class @xmath32 , which is locally located on one side of their boundary . obviously , @xmath33 is connected and @xmath34 is not .",

    "furthermore , let @xmath54 .",
    "a very important property of the porous media is the following variant of poincar s inequality :    [ l1 ] ( see e.g. @xcite ) let @xmath55 then , it holds @xmath56      having defined the geometrical structure of the porous medium , we precise the flow problem . here",
    "we consider the slow viscous incompressible flow of a single fluid through a porous medium .",
    "we suppose the no - slip condition at the boundaries of the pores ( i.e. , a rigid porous medium ) .",
    "then , we describe it by the following non - dimensional steady stokes system in @xmath57 ( the fluid part of the porous medium @xmath49 ) : @xmath58 here the non - dimensional @xmath59 stands for the effects of external forces or an injection at the boundary or a given pressure drop , and it corresponds to the physical forcing term multiplied by the ratio between reynolds number and froude s number squared .",
    "@xmath60 denotes the non - dimensional velocity and @xmath61 is the non - dimensional pressure .",
    "the non - constant force @xmath62 corresponds , e.g. , to a non - constant pressure drop or to injection profiles which are not parabolic .",
