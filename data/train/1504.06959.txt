    "the standard model ( sm ) like higgs boson has discovered at the lhc experiment , and its mass is obtained by the atlas and cms combined experiments as @xmath2  @xcite . in the sm ,",
    "this value of the higgs mass leads the vacuum to be unstable , that is , the higgs quartic coupling @xmath3 becomes zero below , but close to , the planck scale ( @xmath4gev )  @xcite .",
    "the vacuum stability problem may suggest appearance of new physics below the planck scale .",
    "if new particles appear beyond the sm , runnings of the gauge couplings become larger compared to the sm case .",
    "then , the vacuum can be stable up to the planck scale , since runnings of @xmath3 also becomes larger .",
    "furthermore , the change of the running gauge couplings can realize the gauge coupling unification ( gcu ) at a high energy scale ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a general discussion ) .",
    "in addition to the vacuum instability , the hierarchy problem of the higgs mass would be appeared in the sm .",
    "in fact , the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass term can be always multiplicatively subtracted at some energy scale from the bardeen s argument  @xcite .",
    "since a renormalization group equation ( rge ) of the higgs mass term is proportional to itself in the sm , once it is zero at a high energy scale , e.g. , the planck scale , it continues to be zero at lower energy scales .",
    "however , if there are heavy particles coupling with the higgs doublet , the higgs mass term gives logarithmic correction as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are mass of the heavy particle and renormalization scale , respectively .",
    "therefore , the hierarchy problem can be solved if no large intermediate scales exist between the electroweak and the planck scales .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider that the planck scale as a fundamental scale , in which the quadratic divergences are assumed to be completely removed out . to solve the hierarchy problem",
    ", we do not consider any intermediate scale except for the tev scale . under this context , we will investigate possibilities for the realization of the gcu at the planck scale , and discuss the vacuum stability .",
    "this paper is based on our previous work  @xcite .",
    "we investigate possibilities for the realization of gcu at some high energy scales . solving the rges",
    ", we can see the behavior of the gauge couplings in an arbitrary high energy scale .",
    "the one - loop level rges of the gauge couplings @xmath8 are given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , 2 , and 3 , and the coefficients of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 gauge couplings are given by ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16)=(41/6 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) in the sm . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider a gut normalization factor of 3/5 as in @xmath19 gut , i.e. @xmath20 . once particle contents in the model are fixed , contributions to @xmath21 are systematically calculated as in table  [ bi ]  @xcite . in this table , fermions included vector - like to avoid the gauge anomalies .",
    ".contributions to @xmath21 from fermions ( left ) and scalars ( right ) .",
    "@xmath11 hypercharge `` @xmath22 '' can take different values for different representations , and an electric charge is given by @xmath23 with isospin @xmath24 .",

    "three vertical lines represent 0.5tev , 3tev , 10tev , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    in fig.[running_f ] we show runnings of the gauge , the top yukawa , and the higgs quartic couplings , which correspond to the first one of table  [ combination_f ] . here",
    ", we assume extra fermions do not strongly couple with the higgs doublet , and then significantly change runnings of the top yukawa and the higgs quartic couplings .",
    "since @xmath29-functions of the gauge couplings change several times , our previous naive analyses are modified , that the gcu can be realized around @xmath28 by extra fermions satisfying @xmath30 .",
    "to realize the gcu , all the gauge couplings are large compared to those in the sm , which lead the smaller @xmath31 .",
    "then , @xmath3 becomes larger and remains in positive value up to the planck scale , since both the smaller @xmath31 and the larger @xmath32 make @xmath33 become larger .",
    "thus , when the gcu is realized at the planck scale , we expect the vacuum can become stable .",
    "we have investigated possibilities of the gcu at the planck scale in the extended sm which includes extra particles around the tev scale . we have found that the gcu at the planck scale can be realized when extra particles include some relevant scalars , while it can not be realized ( up to one - loop level ) when all extra particles are fermions and their masses are the same . on the other hand , when extra fermions have different masses , the gcu around @xmath28 can be realized . in this case , the vacuum can become stable because of the change of the running gauge couplings .",
