    "mounting evidence indicates that massive molecular cloud cores possess properties which are not adequately explained by models employing an isothermal equation of state . for example , surveys of prestellar cores in a variety of star - forming complexes show that intermediate and high mass cores have nonthermal line widths which are significantly greater than their thermal line widths ( @xcite ) .",
    "models of the collapse of isothermal molecular cloud cores exhibit a number of features which are not borne out by observations , such as a time - invariant rate of accretion onto the central object ( @xcite ) and highly supersonic infall ( @xcite ) .    to address some of the shortcomings of isothermal models",
    ", @xcite advanced a model for molecular cloud core collapse which accounts for some degree of turbulent support via a phenomenological equation of state .",
    "this logatropic equation of state reads + @xmath1 where the subscript `` c '' denotes `` central '' values .",
    "the constant @xmath2 is an adjustable parameter whose value for a range of molecular cloud core masses was determined empirically by @xcite to be @xmath3 .",
    "the logatropic equation of state admits two equilibrium solutions .",
    "the features of each solution are developed in @xcite .",
    "the `` singular '' equilibrium solution is analogous to the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) of @xcite , except that its density profile is @xmath4 .",
    "the `` nonsingular '' solution is analogous to the bonnor - ebert sphere , in that it is a pressure - truncated equilibrium solution with a finite central density and density profile in its outer regions which matches that of the singular solution .",
    "the nonsingular logatrope has the potential to be as useful a model for massive star - forming cores as the bonnor - ebert sphere is for low mass star - forming cores ( see , for example , @xcite , who showed that a bonnor - ebert sphere is an excellent fit to the structure of dark cloud b68 ) .",
    "hence , we undertook a numerical study of the collapse of a nonsingular logatropic sphere from an initially near - equilibrium state until most of its mass had been accreted onto the central condensation .",
    "our fully 3d simulations were conducted using the zeus - mp parallelized hydrodynamics code .",
    "we used a 256@xmath5 cartesian grid with a `` sink cell '' at its centre .",
    "mass falling into the sink cell was presumed to have accreted onto the central protostar and was represented thereafter by a point mass at the grid centre .",
    "the initial configuration for each of our simulations was a spherical molecular cloud core in near hydrodynamic equilibrium , surrounded by an external medium of low and constant pressure .",
    "we conducted extensive tests of our numerical method using the collapse of the singular logatrope ( @xcite ) as our test case .",
    "excellent agreement between the analytic and numerical solutions was found .",
    "( see @xcite for a full description of our numerical method ) .",
    "the most interesting of our results from the collapse of the nonsingular logatrope are presented in figures [ f9]-[f11b ] .",
    "figures [ f9 ] and [ f10 ] show the evolution of the density and infall speed profiles of a collapsing nonsingular logatrope prior to the formation of a singular density profile .",
    "the model has been scaled such that the total mass of the core is 1 m@xmath6 .",
    "the total core mass is determined by the choice of central temperature and external pressure  our choices of @xmath7  k and @xmath8  k@xmath9 result in a core of total mass 1  m@xmath6 , but the results can be rescaled and applied to models of higher mass ( for example , by assuming a higher confining pressure ) . indeed , observational evidence has emerged which indicates that the confining pressures on molecular cloud cores are one or two orders of magnitude higher than we assumed ( @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps one of the most notable features of figure [ f9 ] is the behaviour of the density profile at late times . at the moment when the density becomes singular ( labeled @xmath10 ) , the density in the inner parts of the core scales as @xmath11",
    "this is the density profile expected for a collapsing singular logatropic sphere , as well as for a collapsing sis .",
    "this implies that , whereas observations of r@xmath12 density profiles in molecular cloud cores have traditionally been interpreted as evidence for isothermal collapse , this should no longer be the case .",
    "even models which incorporate turbulent support will show such a density profile .    because of their extra nonthermal support , nonsingular logatropic spheres collapse more `` gently '' than do their isothermal counterparts . as can be seen by comparing our figure [ f10 ] with figure 1a of @xcite ,",
    "the logatropic collapse is more gentle than that of the bonnor - ebert sphere .",
    "@xcite find that , at the time of singularity formation , 44% of the mass of a bonnor - ebert sphere is in supersonic infall .",
    "we find that less than 5.5% of a nonsingular logatrope is in supersonic infall at the same point in its evolution .",
    "figure [ f11b ] shows the rate of accretion onto the central object in collapsing nonsingular logatropes of masses 1 , 2.5 , and 5  m@xmath6 .",
    "the reader should bear in mind that these are fiducial masses only  the models can be rescaled to produce much more massive cores and hence higher accretion rates by increasing the confining pressure .",
    "each curve shows the evolution of the accretion rate from the near - equilibrium starting point and until 95% , 91% , and 29% of the total available mass has been accreted ( for the 1 , 2.5 , and 5  m@xmath6 cases respectively ) .",
    "the accretion profiles shown in figure [ f11b ] bear several important similarities to what is known observationally about accretion in young stellar objects .",
    "a simple picture of the evolution of an accreting molecular cloud core suggests an accretion history of the following form : accretion proceeds slowly through the pre - protostellar ( ppc ) phase , increases markedly at the formation of a central source ( to power the substantial outflows seen in class o sources ) , and finally declines and dissipates as the core passes into the class i stage .",
    "@xcite mark the transition between the class o and class i phase at the point where the mass accreted onto the central object is roughly equal to that remaining in the envelope .",
    "our results show a similar transition at the same point .",
    "as indicated for the 1  m@xmath6 curve in figure [ f11b ] , there is an initial period of slow accretion , which we liken to the ppc stage .",
    "as soon as the density profile of the core becomes singular ( @xmath10 ) , which can be thought of as the moment of protostar formation , the accretion rate increases markedly , launching a phase of vigorous accretion sufficient to power an outflow .",
    "we liken this to the class 0 phase .",
    "once half of the available mass has been accreted , the accretion rate declines steadily to near - zero .",
    "we suggest that our simulations of the collapse of logatropic molecular cloud cores bear significant similarities to the observations .",
    "they offer an alternative method for modelling the structure of intermediate and higher mass molecular cloud cores .",
    "cores which exhibit density power - law indices of between 1 and 1.5 ( see , for example , @xcite ) should be pursued as possible candidate nonsingular logatropes .",
    "our results bolster the argument that models of collapsing protostellar cores _ must _ account for some degree of nonthermal support in order to reproduce the observations .",
