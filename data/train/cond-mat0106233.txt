    "in spite of the advance attained in the research of the high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , a great number of questions related to them remain to be answered . in order to obtain a better understanding of these new materials",
    "many experiments were performed , but the different experiments were interpreted by different theories .",
    "one of the most fundamental evidence that these experiments showed was the interplay among critical temperature @xmath0 , hole content @xmath1 , and pressure @xmath6 , since one of the effects of the application of external pressure is a change in the hole content @xmath1 in the @xmath9 planes  @xcite , which results in a large change in @xmath0 .",
    "the large increase of @xmath0 by the application of pressure  @xcite has been the motivation for a vast number of works on the study of the effects of pressure on the critical temperature @xmath0 of the high temperature superconductors  @xcite , not only to achieve higher @xmath0 but also to obtain a hint for chemical substitution which originates new materials and yields a better understanding of their physical properties .",
    "thus , in the detailed study of the dependence of the critical temperature @xmath0 of the htsc on the pressure @xmath6 , it has been suggested that the derivate @xmath10 may be strongly influenced by a pressure - induced alteration in the density of hole - like charge carriers @xmath1 on the @xmath9 planes  @xcite .",
    "this proposal was also supported by experimental observations of hall constant s pressure dependence  @xcite that confirmed the existence of a growth in @xmath1 in the @xmath9 planes when the pressure is applied  @xcite . therefore , there is a pressure induced charge transfer ( pict ) from the block layers into the @xmath9 planes , that is , @xmath11 .",
    "since one expects @xmath12 at the optimum doping , and @xmath13 generally increases with @xmath6 , it is well accepted that the pressure also increases @xmath0 by a different mechanism of  intrinsic \" origin  @xcite , and such intrinsic term is a characteristic of each family of compounds .",
    "therefore , we can separate these two effects by considering  @xcite :    @xmath14    here the first term , @xmath15 , represents the intrinsic contribution , not related to the charge transfer induced by pressure @xmath16 . thus , the change of @xmath0 with the hole content is given by @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we consider the intrinsic contribution as originated from a variation of the magnitude @xmath4 , of the attractive potential that forms the cooper pairs in the superconducting phase with the applied pressure @xmath6 , in such a way that @xmath18 .",
    "similar proposition was previously made by angilella et al .",
    "@xcite and de mello et al  @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as @xmath4 increases with the applied pressure , the zero temperature superconductor gap also increases .",
    "this hypothesis has been indirectly verified in the experimental study of polycristallines samples of @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "in order to study the dynamics of the hole - type carriers in the superconducting phase as well as the normal phase with correlations and the basic attractive interaction , we consider a two dimension extended hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the hopping integral between the nearest - neighbour and next - nearest - neighbour sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the on - site correlated repulsion and @xmath25 describes the attractive interaction between nearest - neighbour sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in the superconducting phase the paired states form a condensate separated from the single - particle states by a",
    " gap \" ( order parameter ) . using a bcs - type mean - field approximation  @xcite the self - consistent gap equation , at finite temperatures ,",
    "is given by    @xmath26    with @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the interaction potential which contains the repulsive and attractive potential , and may be written in a separable form  @xcite    @xmath29    where it was considered a square lattice of lattice parameter @xmath30 and equal coupling constants @xmath4 along both directions in the cu - o planes , in the context of mean field approximation .",
    "a tight - binding approximation may be employed to dispersion relation in eq.[r ] , which yields    @xmath31    this equation has been previously considered  @xcite , but here it was considered identical hopping integrals along both directions in the cu - o planes for the nearest - neighbour ( @xmath32 ) and a different one for the next - nearest - neighbour ( @xmath33 ) ; @xmath34 is the chemical potential .    also , using the same bcs - type mean - field approximation applied to the gap ( eq.[c ] ) , we obtain the hole - content equation  @xcite    @xmath35    where @xmath36 .    following the steps of ref  @xcite , one observes that the substitution of the potential ( eq.[d ] ) in the gap equation ( eq.[c ] ) leads to the appearance of a gap with two different symmetries    @xmath37 , \\label{g}\\ ] ]    where the plus sign is for @xmath2 wave and the minus sign , for @xmath3 wave symmetry .",
    "the anisotropy of the gap is one of the characteristic distinction between the usual low temperatures superconductors and the htsc .",
    "many experiments and theoretical calculations suggest that the htsc exhibit a pairing symmetry different than the usual superconductors  @xcite , and in some cases even a mixture of different symmetries must be considered  @xcite .",
    "thus , the determination of the symmetry of the gap is the first step in the identification of the pairing mechanism of the charge carriers and the subsequent development of a microscopic theory for the htsc .    to obtain the phase diagram ,",
    "the gap equations are solved numerically , in the limit @xmath38 , together and self - consistently with the density of hole carriers @xmath1 ( eq.[f ] ) . in these calculations",
    "it was considered that there were no symmetry mixture near the critical point  @xcite .",
    "the values of the hopping integrals @xmath39 and @xmath33 used in the calculation of the phase diagram of the @xmath7 series are taken from a.r.p.@xmath40e.s .",
    "measurements for the bi2212  @xcite , since it is a htsc with similar structure , having two @xmath9 identical layers per unit cell  @xcite , although this does not guarantee that the real @xmath39 and @xmath33 have this values and that is why we have tried a small variation around the a.r.p.e.s results .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath34 is calculated self - consistently .",
    "the values of @xmath24 and @xmath4 are considered adjustable parameters , in order to reproduce the @xmath41 curve close to the experimental data .",
    "our method to derive the phase diagrams is similar to the approach based on a change in the zero temperature gap  @xcite . on fig .",
    "1 we show the phase diagram with the theoretical curves from the numerical calculation for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 wave symmetries , together with the experimental data for the @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "2 illustrates the behavior of the phase diagram , for the @xmath2 symmetry , when @xmath4 is varied .",
    "both symmetries exhibit a similar dependence on the potential @xmath4 .",
    "=    notice that although there is a strong tendency toward a @xmath3-wave symmetry on many experiments the htsc , our results , with the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath33 fixed , show that the @xmath2 symmetry seems to reproduce well the phase diagram of the @xmath7 series in a better agreement with the experimental points than the @xmath3 wave one .",
    "this is in accordance with the results of schneider et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , the study of the phase diagram yields the best values @xmath39=0.05ev , @xmath33=0.023ev , @xmath24=0.052ev and @xmath4=-0.0875ev for the @xmath2 symmetry , and @xmath39=0.05ev , @xmath33=0.0275ev , @xmath24=0.052ev and @xmath4=-0.057ev for the @xmath3 wave symmetry , which will be used in the next section .",
    "2 we show that @xmath0 is quite sensible with respect to a change in the magnitude @xmath4 of the attractive potential . therefore , as it was previous mentioned",
    ", we suppose that the pressure induces a change in the attractive potential , in such a way that @xmath18 . in the absence of informations of how @xmath4 effective behaves with respect to the pressure @xmath6 , we assume a linear dependence  @xcite , which should be the case since the pressure causes very small structural changes in the lattice constants  @xcite",
    ". therefore    @xmath42    in the same way , for the density of carriers , we have    @xmath43    here , @xmath4 and @xmath1 are the @xmath44 values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the pressure dependence is defined as    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are parameters usually determined from the experimental data .",
    "our previous discussion leads to @xmath50 thus , we can estimate @xmath0 for a compound with a certain value @xmath1 , and under pressure @xmath6 , using an expansion of @xmath51 in terms of @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , we have    @xmath52    where    @xmath53    @xmath54 is the critical temperature for @xmath6=0 . the eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) can be written as    @xmath55    with    @xmath56    one can see by considering the case @xmath57 in the above equation , and comparing with eq.([a ] ) , that    @xmath58    which clearly shows that , in our model , the intrinsic contribution is related to the variation of the magnitude @xmath4 of the attractive potential with the pressure @xmath6 .",
    "now , the analytical expressions for the coefficients @xmath59 will be derived below as a function of the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for the values of @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "the first coefficient ( @xmath57 ) for the above expression is given by    @xmath62    restricting ourselves to small changes in @xmath4 , we may approximate    @xmath63    where the horizontal bar denotes a  mean \" over the values of @xmath0 obtained direct from the phase diagram as a function of @xmath4 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "mean \" is realized for each value of @xmath64 . to estimate @xmath17 we may either use an experimental value , or use directly the curves of fig . 2 or a phenomenological universal parabolic curve  @xcite :    @xmath65,\\label{q1}\\ ] ]    and , therefore , an analytical expression for @xmath66",
    "is obtained .",
    "thus , we derive the following expression for the coefficient @xmath67    @xmath68    and @xmath69 , which is given by    @xmath70    and results in    @xmath71    where ( @xmath72 ) is an empirical mean derived numerically by inspection on fig . 2 at the optimum doping compound @xmath73 .",
    "following along the same procedure , the third coefficient becomes    @xmath74    as one can notice the coefficients @xmath59 , for @xmath75 , are all nulls .",
    "in order to study the effects of the pressure on the critical temperature of any given family of compounds , we need first to calculate the constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which yield the coefficients @xmath59 .",
    "thus , we can see that the constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 are determined by how @xmath4 and @xmath1 changes with the pressure ( eq ( [ j ] ) ) .",
    "hall effects can give directly @xmath76 as in the case of bi2212  @xcite and therefore @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "since these measurements are not available for the @xmath7 , we can obtain @xmath60 and @xmath61 by comparing with the curves of @xmath77 for two values of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact wijngaarden et al .",
    "@xcite also estimate the value of @xmath61 from their experimental data for the @xmath78 + @xmath79 .    since at low pressures",
    "only the linear term comes into play , the higher order coefficients can be ignored .",
    "thus , @xmath67 becomes the slope of a linear approximation from the initial points of the @xmath80 curve , for a given @xmath1 compound .",
    "starting with @xmath1=@xmath73 , in spite of not being strictly necessary , we determine @xmath60 using the estimated @xmath67 in eq.([t ] ) , as long as at @xmath73 the charge transfer term vanishes . to determine @xmath61 we estimate @xmath67 from the @xmath77 curve of an @xmath81 compound , and use again eq.([t ] ) .",
    "once these two constants are determined , the @xmath59 coefficients for any @xmath1 value can be calculated ( eq.([n ] ) ) .    for the @xmath7  @xcite series we used the experimental values for the @xmath82 and @xmath1=0.20 compounds to calculate @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the estimated @xmath67 were 1.5@xmath83 and 0.41@xmath84 for @xmath73 and @xmath1=0.20 , respectively .",
    "the phase diagram parameters ( @xmath85 ) taken from fig . 1 and 2 and used in the calculations were 2900@xmath86 for the @xmath2 wave and 2300@xmath87 for the @xmath3 wave symmetry for the @xmath73 compound and 2700@xmath86 for the @xmath2 wave and 2600@xmath87 for the @xmath3 wave symmetry for the @xmath1=0.20 compound . the parameters of the parabolic curve ( eq.[q1 ] ) used were @xmath88 and @xmath89=105.1k . therefore , the resulting constants were @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the @xmath2 wave and @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the @xmath3 wave symmetry .    on fig . 3 and 4 we present our results in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "one observes that , for the optimum doping , and the compounds near the optimum doping , we have a rather good result . for the optimum compound ( @xmath1=0.15 ) in particular , we had the better result , for both symmetries , with very good agreement with the experimental data  @xcite . for @xmath1=0.075 , 0.20 and 0.25 we can reproduce well the low temperature data and",
    "obtain a qualitative agreement on the high pressure region .",
    "=    =    the value of the constant @xmath61 ( @xmath94 ) , which means the rate of charge transfer by the pressure ( @xmath95 ) , for the @xmath2 symmetry is close to the experimental results for the @xmath96 compounds  @xcite , and is smaller than the experimental hall coefficient value for the bi2212  @xcite . the value estimated experimentally by wijngaarden et al .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath97 + @xmath98 series was @xmath99 .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed to the parameters @xmath85 , which are difficult to be estimated with the very few experimental points , what introduces some uncertainties in the calculated phase diagrams .",
    "this discrepancy is also the reason why our curves is in good agreement with the experimental data up to @xmath100 , but starts to deviate above this value .",
    "another evidence that our main source of error comes from @xmath101 is the fact that the optimum compound , with @xmath1=0.15 , which is the one with @xmath102=0 , is in much better agreement with the experimental results than the others , with different @xmath1 .",
    "in conclusion , to relate the pressure @xmath6 , the density of holes @xmath1 and the attractive potential @xmath4 we used in the calculation a bcs - type mean - field approach on the bidimensional extended hubbard hamiltonian with the potential @xmath4 as an adjustable parameter .",
    "our method has general application , and can therefore be used in any compound under pressure .",
    "we showed that these calculations can describe reasonably well the pressure effects on the critical temperature @xmath0 for the series @xmath7 , for the four measured doping values .",
    "our results for the @xmath2 wave symmetry give a better quantitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "but the @xmath3-wave calculations are also in qualitative agreement with the experimental data , showing that the order parameter symmetry is not decisive to study the pressure effects .",
    "thus , our method provides a very interesting novel explanation to the intrinsic term , which is related with the change in the potential @xmath4 , in agreement with a previous hypothesis that the pressure increases the zero temperature superconducting gap  @xcite and with some experimental results  @xcite .",
