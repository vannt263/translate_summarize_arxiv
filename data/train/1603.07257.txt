    "modern real - world infrastructures can be modeled as a system of several interdependent networks @xcite .",
    "for example , a power grid and the communication network that executes control over its power stations constitute a system of two interdependent networks .",
    "power stations depend on communication networks to function , and communication networks can not function without electricity .",
    "there have been several recent attempts to model these systems @xcite .",
    "one of these is based on a model of mutual percolation ( momp ) in which a node in each network can function only if ( 1 ) it receives a crucial commodity from support nodes in other networks and ( 2 ) it belongs to the giant component ( gc ) formed by other functional nodes in its own network .    if the nodes within each network of the system are randomly connected , and the support links connecting the nodes in different networks are also random , then the momp for an arbitrary network of networks ( non ) can be solved analytically using the framework of generating functions , which allows to map the stochastic model into node percolation .",
    "it turns out that a non is significantly more vulnerable than a single network with the same degree distribution . in regular percolation of a single network ,",
    "the size of the gc gradually approaches zero when the fraction @xmath4 of nodes that survived the initial failure , approaches the critical value @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , in the momp , the fraction of nodes in the mutual gc , @xmath6 undergoes a discontinuous first - order phase transition at @xmath7 , dropping from a positive value , @xmath8 , for @xmath9 to zero , for @xmath10 .    the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite extended momp to euclidian lattices by studying the process of cascading failures in two lattices @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the same size @xmath13 in which the dependency links are limited by a distance constraint @xmath3 . in this case",
    "there is a particular value of @xmath3 denoted by @xmath14 below which there is a second - order transition and above which the system collapses in a first - order transition .",
    "this process is characterized by the formation of spatial holes that burn the entire system when @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the first rule of momp is quite general and can be easily verified from an engineering standpoint , but the second rule is not easy to verify .",
    "although it seems that a functioning node must belong to the giant component in order to receive sufficient power , information , or fuel from its own network , this condition can be relaxed , i.e. , the second rule in the momp can be replaced by a more general rule ( @xmath16 ) in which a node in order to be functional must belong to a connected component of size greater than or equal to @xmath0 , formed by other functional nodes of this network .",
    "this rule is significantly more general and realistic than rule ( 2 ) because the nodes in finite components are still able to receive sufficient commodities to continue functioning .",
    "note that the original rule ( 2 ) is actually a particular case of rule ( @xmath16 ) for @xmath17 . in this paper",
    ", we will show how the replacement of condition ( 2 ) by the more general condition @xmath18 with @xmath19 affects the results in complex networks and euclidean lattices @xcite .",
    "the most important role of the momp of a non is played by the function @xmath20 @xcite such that @xmath21 is the fraction of nodes in the _ giant component _ of network @xmath22 of the non after a random failure of a fraction @xmath23 of its nodes .",

    "thus for @xmath79 we always have a first - order transition , which was previously found @xcite , but only for @xmath17 .",
    "the different kinds of transitions that we find in our model are reminiscent of the ones found in _",
    "k_-core percolation @xcite .",
    "k_-core of a graph is a maximal connected subgraph of the original graph in which all vertices have degree at least @xmath86 , formed by repeatedly deleting all vertices of degree less than @xmath86 . in particular , in 2-core there is a continuous transition , while for @xmath87 the transition is first - order , as in our model for @xmath2 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the key difference between the _",
    "k_-core transition and our model is that in our model the functionality of a node is not based on its degree but rather on the size of the finite components to which it belongs .",
    "the similarity between the phase transitions in our model and the ones in _",
    "k_-core is due to a resemblance between the pruning rules of both processes .",

    "next we will see that the similarities of the phase transitions arise due to the similarities in the leading terms of the taylor expansions of the equations that govern _ k_-core and our model .",
