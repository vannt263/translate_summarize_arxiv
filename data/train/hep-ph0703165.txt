    "the up - down quark mixing element , @xmath0 , of the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix can be determined via three @xmath2-decay routes : superallowed @xmath3 nuclear decays , neutron decay and pion decay . historically , the nuclear decays have yielded the most precise measurements , but the resultant value for @xmath0 was often thought to be severely limited in accuracy by the calculated nuclear - structure - dependent corrections that were required to extract it from the data .",
    "the neutron measurements , though free of nuclear corrections , are experimentally challenging and have therefore been less precise , not to mention occasionally inconsistent with one another .",
    "pion @xmath2 decay , being a @xmath4 decay branch , is even more challenging experimentally and has produced larger uncertainties for @xmath0 than either of the other two approaches .",
    "all three decay modes require that small radiative corrections be applied to the primary experimental data in the process of obtaining a value for @xmath0 , and naturally there are uncertainties associated with these calculated corrections .",
    "in fact , in the case of the superallowed nuclear decays , the experimental uncertainties have become so well controled that it is these theoretical uncertainties that dominate the uncertainty quoted on @xmath0 .",
    "however , it may be a surprise to some readers that the nuclear - structure - dependent correction is _ not _ the main contributor .",
    "instead , the dominant theoretical uncertainty originates from the so - called inner radiative correction , which is a correction that is common to all three decay modes and , unless it is improved , will ultimately limit the precision with which @xmath0 can be determined by any route .",
    "as more and more superallowed @xmath3 nuclear transitions are measured with high precision , the nuclear - structure - dependent corrections continue to prove their validity .",
    "the calculations themselves are based on well - established nuclear structure information derived from nuclear measurements that are totally independent of the superallowed decay experiments .",
    "the magnitude of the calculated correction for each transition , though always less than 1.5% , differs considerably from transition to transition .",
    "the measured superallowed transition strengths , which are an order of magnitude more precise than that , actually reproduce these predicted differences and , as a result , lead to completely consistent values of @xmath0 .",
    "all evidence points to the nuclear - structure - dependent corrections being completely reliable within their quoted uncertainties .",
    "beta decay between nuclear analog states of spin - parity , @xmath5 , and isospin , @xmath6 , is a pure vector transition and is nearly independent of the nuclear structure of the parent and daughter states .",
    "the measured strength of such a transition  expressed as an ",
    "@xmath7 value \"  can then be related directly to the vector coupling constant , @xmath8 with the intervention of only a few small ( @xmath91% ) calculated terms to account for radiative and nuclear - structure - dependent effects .",
    "once @xmath8 has been determined in this way , it is only another short step to obtain a value for @xmath0 , the up - down mixing element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .        in dealing with these decays , which are referred to as superallowed ,",
    "it is convenient to combine some of the small correction terms with the measured @xmath7-value and define a  corrected \" @xmath10-value .",
    "thus , we write @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 gev@xmath13s ; @xmath14 is the isospin - symmetry - breaking correction and @xmath15 is the transition - independent part of the radiative correction ",
    "the  inner \" radiative correction .",
    "the terms @xmath16 and @xmath17 comprise the transition - dependent part of the radiative correction , the former being a function only of the electron s energy and the @xmath18 of the daughter nucleus , while the latter , like @xmath14 , depends in its evaluation on the details of nuclear structure . from this equation , it can be seen that a measurement of any one of these superallowed transitions establishes an individual value for @xmath8 ; moreover , if the conserved vector current ( cvc ) assertion is correct that @xmath8 is not renormalized in the nuclear medium , all such values  and all the @xmath10-values themselves",
    " should be identical within uncertainties , regardless of the specific nuclei involved .",
    "this assertion of cvc can be tested and a value for @xmath8 obtained with a precision considerably better than 0.1% if experiment can meet the challenge , since the four small corrections terms only contribute to the overall uncertainty at the 0.03% level . as it turns out",
    ", experiment has exceeded that goal , leaving theory currently as the dominant contributor to the uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath7-value that characterizes any @xmath2-transition depends on three measured quantities : the total transition energy , @xmath19 ; the half - life , @xmath20 , of the parent state ; and the branching ratio , @xmath21 , for the particular transition of interest . the @xmath19-value is required to determine the statistical rate function , @xmath22 , while the half - life and branching ratio combine to yield the partial half - life , @xmath23 . in 2005",
    "a new survey of world data on superallowed @xmath3 beta decays was published @xcite .",
    "all previously published measurements were included , even those that were based on outdated calibrations if enough information was provided that they could be corrected to modern standards . in all , more than 125 independent measurements of comparable precision , spanning four decades , made the cut .",
    "another 8 publications , with data that can also be incorporated , have appeared @xcite in the two years since the survey was closed and we have now obtained @xmath7 and corrected @xmath10 values for the combined data values , we have used slightly different values for @xmath16 and @xmath17 than those used by us previously @xcite .",
    "this is because the recent improvements in @xmath15 by marciano and sirlin @xcite isolated some transition - dependent components which were more appropriately included in these other terms .",
    "although the average value of @xmath10 is thus changed by @xmath90.3% , a corresponding change in @xmath15 leaves the central value of @xmath0 essentially unchanged . ] .",
    "these updated results for the thirteen most precisely known transitions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    by comparing the left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we can see that the calculated corrections act very well to remove the considerable scatter that is evident in the former but missing in the latter .",
    "since @xmath16 has essentially the same value for all transitions other than those from @xmath24c and @xmath25o , the removal of the scatter must be attributed to the calculated nuclear - structure - dependent corrections , @xmath17 and @xmath14 , that have been applied in the derivation of @xmath10 .",
    "the calculation of these correction terms @xcite was based on nuclear - structure models that were solidly grounded in a wide variety of independent nuclear measurements , none involving superallowed @xmath2 decay .",
    "thus the consistency of the @xmath10 values is a powerful validation of those calculated corrections .",
    "all thirteen @xmath10 values form a statistically consistent set  with a normalized chi - square of 0.9  over a wide range of nuclear masses , from @xmath26=10 to @xmath26=74 , a conclusion that is entirely consistent with cvc expectation .",
    "the average of all thirteen cases is @xmath27 = 3073.9(8)s .",
    "since @xmath10 is inversely proportional to the _ square _ of @xmath8 , this result confirms the constancy of the latter to 1.3 parts in @xmath28 , the tightest limit ever set .",
    "the 2005 survey results were also used to set a limit on any possible contribution from scalar currents .",
    "the presence of a scalar current  induced or fundamental  would manifest itself as a curvature , either upwards or downwards , in the @xmath10-value line at low z. there is no hint of any such curvature in the right panel of fig.[fig1 ] , and a careful analysis of the survey results set a limit @xcite on the scalar relative to the vector current of @xmath29 , again the tightest limit ever set .    with a mutually consistent set of @xmath10 values , no scalar currents , and the test of cvc passed",
    ", one can confidently proceed to determining the value of @xmath8 and , from it , the up - down element of the ckm matrix via the relation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the well known @xcite weak - interaction constant for purely leptonic muon decay . from the @xmath10-value data in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the recently improved calculation of @xmath15 @xcite we obtain the result , @xmath32 } \\label{nuclear}\\ ] ] this number can be compared with our previous value , quoted in the 2005 survey , @xmath0 = 0.97380(40 ) .",
    "the new result is completely consistent with the earlier one , but it has a considerably reduced uncertainty  mostly due to the improvement in the calculated  inner \" radiative correction , @xmath15 .",
    "error budgets for the three different methods to determine @xmath0 , illustrating the relative importance of experimental uncertainties and theoretical ones .",
    "the unbracketed values of @xmath0 correspond to the the results shown in numbered equations in the text ; bracketed values are alternative results obtained under different conditions also described in the text.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the  error budget \" leading to the uncertainty quoted for @xmath0 in eq.[nuclear ] is illustrated in the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] . the largest contribution to",
    "the uncertainty comes from @xmath15 ( @xmath330.00018 ) , while the nuclear - structure - dependent corrections contribute @xmath330.00015 and experimental uncertainties only @xmath330.00007 .",
    "on the one hand , free neutron decay has an advantage over nuclear decays since there are no nuclear - structure- dependent corrections to be calculated . on the other hand",
    ", it has the disadvantage that it is not purely vector - like but has a mix of vector and axial - vector contributions .",
    "thus , in addition to a lifetime measurement , a correlation experiment is also required to separate the vector and axial - vector pieces .",
    "both types of experiment present serious experimental challenges .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is determined from the expression    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the ratio of axial - vector and vector effective coupling constants , @xmath36 is the mean life for neutron decay , @xmath22 is the statistical rate function and @xmath37 is the transition - dependent radiative correction evaluated for the case of a neutron .",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath36 must be determined from experiment .    in 2003 ,",
    "a survey of world data for neutron @xmath2 decay was published @xcite , in which the same citeria were used as for the superallowed nuclear beta - decay measurements :  _ i.e. _  all measurements were retained unless they had been withdrawn by the original authors or could be rejected on objective grounds . since that time , there have been two new mean - life measurements @xcite that fit within the criteria for inclusion .",
    "strikingly , one of these measurements , by serebrov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , disagrees with the previous world average by more than six standard deviations .",
    "however , without any objective grounds for rejecting this discrepant result  or , alternatively , rejecting all preceeding measurements  we have evaluated the world average with all data included .",
    "the result for the neutron mean life is then @xmath36 = 882.0(15 ) s ( with @xmath38/n = 5.4 ! ) ; and for the coupling - constant ratio is @xmath35 = -1.2690(28 ) ( with @xmath38/n = 2.6 ) .    inserting these average experimental results for @xmath36 and @xmath35 into eq .",
    "[ vud2n ] , we determine @xmath0 to be @xmath39 } \\label{neutron}\\ ] ] a value with much larger uncertainty than the nuclear result and just outside of one standard deviation away from it .",
    "it is also worth noting , though , that in considering the neutron mean life , the particle data group has taken a different approach @xcite and has completely rejected the serebrov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite result simply because it does disagree significantly with previous measurements .",
    "if we do the same thing , then we obtain @xmath0 = 0.9747(18 ) , which fully overlaps the nuclear result but still has an uncertainty that is nearly 7 times larger .    the error budget for the result in eq .",
    "[ neutron ] appears in the center panel of figure [ fig2 ] . unlike the nuclear result in the left panel , this uncertainty",
    "is completely dominated by experiment .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to recognize that the contribution from @xmath15 is the same for the neutron as it is for the nuclear decays .",
    "even as the neutron s experimental results are improved , the value of @xmath0 obtained from them will ultimately be limited in precision at very nearly the same level that the nuclear result has currently reached .    like neutron decay",
    ", pion beta decay has an advantage over nuclear decays in that there are no nuclear - structure - dependent corrections to be made .",
    "it also has the same advantage as the nuclear decays in being a purely vector transition , in its case @xmath40 , so no separation of vector and axial - vector components is required .",
    "its major disadvantage , however , is that the beta - decay mode , @xmath41 , is a @xmath42 branch of the total pion decay .",
    "this results in severe experimental limitations . for the pion beta decay ,",
    "the value of @xmath0 is determined from the expression @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mean life and branching ratio for pion beta decay , @xmath22 is the statistical rate function and @xmath37 is the transition - dependent radiative correction evaluated for the case of the pion .",
    "the current world average @xcite for the mean life is @xmath44 = 2.6033(5 ) @xmath46 s. as for the beta - decay branching ratio , the world average is now dominated by the recent pibeta measurement @xcite , which determined it relative to the much stronger @xmath47 branch and improved its experimental precision by more than a factor of 6 .",
    "the latter branch has been determined experimentally but can also be determined  more precisely , in fact  by theoretical calculation @xcite .    with the theoretical value @xmath48 = 1.2352(5 ) @xmath49 ,",
    "the pibeta measurement of the pion beta - decay branching ratio becomes 1.040(6 ) @xmath46 .",
    "equation [ vud2pi ] then yields the result @xmath50 } \\label{pion}\\ ] ] which agrees well with the nuclear result but with 10 times the uncertainty .",
    "if , instead , the experimental measurement had been used for the @xmath51 branching ratio , then @xmath0 = 0.9732(32 ) , which also is consistent with the nuclear result but with an even larger uncertainty .",
    "as of now , superallowed @xmath1 nuclear @xmath2 decay clearly dominates in the determination of @xmath0 . a weighted average of the results quoted in eqs .  [ nuclear ] , [ neutron ] and [ pion ] , yields a result that differs only in the fifth place of decimals from the nuclear result alone ; and , considering the ambiguities present in the other decays , especially in that of the neutron , it seems best for the time being to rely simply upon the unaveraged nuclear result .",
    "this result is not limited by experimental uncertainties but by uncertainties originating in the theoretical corrections applied to the data .",
    "even so , the largest theoretical uncertainty is not due to the nuclear - structure - dependent corrections but rather to the  inner \" radiative correction , @xmath15 , which actually is common to all three @xmath2 decays : nuclear , neutron and pion . clearly it would be beneficial to have confirmation of the nuclear @xmath0 by results of comparable precision from the other two @xmath2-decay modes , but one should not anticipate that either of the latter will actually surpass the nuclear result in the near future .    although experiment is not currently limiting the precision of the nuclear @xmath0 , there is considerable activity at the moment in improving experimental precision and extending measurements to previously unstudied superallowed transitions .",
    "the approach is best illustrated by fig.[fig1 ] and the observation that the calculated corrections are validated by their success in removing the @xmath7-value scatter .",
    "improvements in experimental precision would test the calculations even more severely , as would new examples of @xmath3 transitions specifically selected for having _ larger _ calculated corrections .",
    "the reasoning is that if the @xmath7 values measured for cases with large calculated corrections also turn into corrected @xmath10 values that are consistent with the others , then this must verify the calculations reliability for the existing cases , which have smaller corrections .",
    "in fact , the cases of @xmath52ar , @xmath53ga and @xmath54rb were chosen for this reason and their consistency has already led to considerably increased confidence in the calculated corrections .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that there will be some further improvement in the nuclear value for @xmath0 as a result of this campaign to test the nuclear - structure - dependent corrections .",
    "however , really significant improvements must await a more precise calculation of @xmath15 .",
