    "three beams with the same frequency @xmath169 are used to produce the light field @xmath235 .",
    "the phase differences between these beams determine the position of the nodes of @xmath236 . to ensure that the three beams at frequency @xmath170 yield the corresponding field @xmath237 , their phase differences need to be the same as those between the @xmath169-beams .",
    "unfortunately , because all beams with the same frequency travel along different paths , an interferometric realization of this condition is not easily implemented .",
    "in summary , we have introduced a family of stationary solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation with definite values of the kinetic energy , for which the local collisional energy is compensated by the potential energy . in view of the fact that this property is shared with the well known approximate thomas - fermi solutions , obtained upon neglection of kinetic energy , we have suggested the term `` kinetic thomas - fermi '' ( ktf ) solutions .",
    "such solutions are particularly relevant in the context of optical lattice scenarios , where they represent excited states at the edge of the first brillouin zone .",
    "conditions for the stability of ktf - solutions have been discussed and a general method has been proposed to excite ktf - solutions in experiments by means of time - modulated light - shift potentials .",
    "we have applied our general considerations to a few elementary examples : a 1d optical lattice , a 2d square lattice and a 2d triangular lattice , however , they should apply to more complex lattice geometries including quasi - periodic lattices .",
