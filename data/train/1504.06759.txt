    "models with radiative neutrino mass are of significant experimental interest .",
    "the inherent loop - suppression in such models allows the new physics responsible for neutrino mass to be lighter than otherwise expected . such light new physics can be within experimental reach , either directly , through collider experiments , or indirectly , via e.g.  searches for lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) effects .",
    "the loop suppression becomes more severe as the number of loops increases .",
    "thus , models with three - loop masses are particularly interesting , as they generically require new physics at or around the tev scale",
    ".    he we present a class of models with radiative neutrino mass at the three - loop level  @xcite .",
    "we focus primarily on the knt model  @xcite and report recent analysis showing that the model satisfies lfv constraints , such as @xmath0 , and fits the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "furthermore , the model contains a viable candidate for the dark matter ( dm ) in the universe , in the form of a light right - handed ( rh ) neutrino .",
    "we also show that a strongly first order electroweak phase transition can be achieved with a higgs mass of @xmath1 gev , as measured at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the model contains new charged scalars and we discuss their effect on the one - loop higgs decay to neutral gauge bosons .",
    "afterwards , we show that the knt model belongs to a larger class of related three - loop models and briefly outline their features .",
    "the knt model  @xcite is an extension of the sm with three rh neutrinos , @xmath2 , and two electrically charged scalars , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that are singlet under the @xmath5 gauge group .",
    "in addition , a discrete @xmath6 symmetry is imposed on the model , under which @xmath7 , and all other fields are even .",
    "this symmetry plays two key roles , preventing a tree - level coupling between @xmath8 and the sm higgs , which would otherwise induce tree - level neutrino masses , and ensuring that the lightest fermion @xmath9 is a stable dm candidate .",
    "the lagrangian reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath12 are yukawa couplings which are antisymmetric in the generation indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15  are the majorana rh neutrino masses , @xmath16 is the charge conjugation matrix , and @xmath17 is the tree - level scalar potential , which is given by @xmath18 here @xmath19 denotes the sm higgs doublet .      the neutrino mass matrix elements , arising from the three - loop diagram in fig .",
    "[ diag ] , are given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the charged leptons flavor indices , @xmath22 denotes the three rh neutrinos , and the function @xmath23 is a loop integral which is @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , unlike the conventional seesaw mechanism , the radiatively generated neutrino masses are directly proportional to the charged lepton and rh neutrino masses , as well as being loop - suppressed .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) induces flavor violating processes such as @xmath25 for @xmath26 , generated at one loop via the exchange of the charged scalars @xmath27 .",
    "the branching ratio of such process is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the fine structure constant and @xmath31 .",
    "for the case of @xmath32 , this leads to a new contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath33 . + in our scan of the parameter space of the model we impose the experimental bound @xmath34  @xcite ; and use the allowed values for the neutrino mixing @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the mass squared difference @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "an immediate implication of the @xmath6 symmetry is that that lightest right handed neutrino , @xmath41 , is stable , and hence a candidate for dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the @xmath41 number density get depleted through the process @xmath42 via the @xmath43 and u channels exchange of @xmath4 . in the non - relativistic limit",
    ", the total annihilation cross section is given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 is the relative velocity between the annihilation @xmath41 s .",
    "the relic density after the decoupling of @xmath41 can be obtained by solving the boltzmann equation , and it is approximately given by    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the thermal average of the relative velocity squared of a pair of two @xmath41 particles , @xmath48 is planck mass ; and @xmath49 is the total number of effective massless degrees of freedom at the freeze - out temperature @xmath50**. * *    in fig .",
    "[ msmn ] , we plot the allowed mass range for @xmath51 that gives the observed dark matter relic density  @xcite .",
    "as seen in the figure , the neutrino experimental data , the bound on lfv process , combined with the relic density , seems to prefer @xmath52 for large regions of parameter space .",
    "however , the masses of both the dm and the charged scalar @xmath4 are bounded from above , with @xmath53  and @xmath54 , respectively . *  *    [ om ]     ( red ) and @xmath55 ( green ) versus the lightest rh neutrino mass , where the consistency with the neutrino data , lfv constraints and the dm relic density have been imposed.__,width=283,height=207 ]      although the sm has all the qualitative ingredients for electroweak baryogenesis , the amount of matter - antimatter asymmetry generated is too small .",
    "one of the reasons has to with the fact that the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is not strongly first order , which is necessary to suppress the sphaleron processes in the broken phase .",
    "the strength of the ewpt can be improved if there are new scalar degrees of freedom around the electroweak scale coupled to the sm higgs , which is the case in the knt model .",
    "the investigation of the scalar effective potential reveals that , within the allowed parameter space of the model , the strength of the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) can be first order  @xcite .",
    "we find that if the one - loop corrections to the higgs mass are sizeable , then the condition @xmath56 for having a first order ewpt can be realized while keeping the higgs mass around @xmath57  gev .",
    "the reason for this being that the extra charged singlets affect the dynamics of the sm scalar field vev around the critical temperature  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ ct ] , we show the plot for @xmath58 versus the critical temperature and one observes that a strongly first order ewpt is possible while the critical temperature lies around 100 @xmath59 .",
    ".__,width=283,height=207 ]      since the rh neutrinos couple to the charged leptons , one excepts them to be produced at @xmath60 colliders , such as the ilc and clic , with a collision energy @xmath61 of few hundreds of up to a tev",
    ". if the produced pairs are the form @xmath62 or @xmath63 , then @xmath64 will decay into a charged lepton and @xmath4 , and subsequently @xmath4 decays into @xmath41 and a charged lepton .",
    "in addition , the sm neutrinos will be also produced via the decay of the charged scalar @xmath65 .",
    "here we concentrate on he process @xmath66",

    "we consider @xmath77 we use lanhep and calchep to simulate our model and generate the differential cross section and the relevant kinematic variables for different cm energy : @xmath78250 , 350 , 500 and1 , with unpolarized beams at first ; and then we consider the polarized beams with @xmath79 $ ] and/or @xmath80 $ ] . imposing the appropriate cuts given in table-[t1 ] , we show in fig .",
    "[ svsl ] the dependance of the significance on the accumulated luminosity with and without polarized beams for the considered cm energies .",
    "we clearly see that for a polarized beam , the signal can be observed even with relatively low integrated luminosity . for example , at @xmath81 , the 5 @xmath82 required luminosity is 150 @xmath83 for polarized beam as compared to 700 @xmath83 without polarization .",

    "the knt model is a simple theory that is capable of simultaneously addressing the neutrino mass and dm problems .",
    "it predicts new physics that can be probed at colliders and precision experiments . within the knt model ,",
    "the dm is part of a @xmath91-odd sector that propagates in the inner loop of the neutrino mass diagram ( see figure  [ diag ] ) .",
    "one might wonder whether generalizations of the knt model exist .",
    "it is well known that the seesaw mechanism can be generalized to a type - iii variant with @xmath92 triplet fermions  @xcite , and a further variant with quintuplet fermions  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising , therefore , to learn that the knt model forms part of a larger class of theories that similarly achieve neutrino mass at the three - loop level , with dm propagating in the inner loop .",
    "the generalized models require that the sm be extended to include the charged singlet scalar @xmath93 , a new scalar @xmath94 , and three real fermions @xmath8 .",
    "however , instead of taking @xmath94 and @xmath8 as @xmath95 singlets , the variant models employ larger multiplets .",
    "the resulting models share key similarities with the knt model , with the neutrino mass diagram retaining the exact form in figure  [ diag ] , and the dm remaining as the lightest fermion @xmath8 . however , there are also some interesting differences , relative to the knt model .",
    "firstly , the dm is now part a larger multiplet with non - trivial gauge interactions .",
    "this modifies expectations for the dm mass and allows new dm interactions .",
    "secondly , there are interesting consequences for the @xmath91 symmetry , which depend on the specific details of the model , as we now outline :    * : here @xmath96 and @xmath97 are taken as @xmath95 triplets  @xcite .",
    "similar to the knt model , the triplet model requires a @xmath91 symmetry with action @xmath98 to prevent tree - level neutrino masses and ensure a stable dm candidate .",
    "the dm is the neutral component of the lightest triplet fermion and has extra yukawa interactions mediated by @xmath99 in eq .  .",
    "consequently its mass increases to @xmath100  tev  @xcite .",
    "* : this model employs the multiplets @xmath101 and @xmath102  @xcite . unlike the knt model and the triplet model",
    ", the quintuplet variant does not require a @xmath91 symmetry to prevent tree - level neutrino mass .",
    "it is therefore a viable model of radiative neutrino mass , independent of dm considerations .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath91 symmetry @xmath98 is broken by a single coupling @xmath103 in the model ; for technically - natural values of @xmath104 , one obtains a long - lived dm candidate , while in the limit @xmath105 the @xmath91 symmetry becomes exact and the dm is absolutely stable  @xcite .",
    "the quintuplet model is therefore a model of radiative neutrino mass , with or without dm , depending on the region of parameter space considered . due to the gauge interactions",
    ", the case with dm requires @xmath106  tev . * : this case has @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and is of particular interest  @xcite .",
    "similar to the quintuplet model , the @xmath91 symmetry is not required to prevent tree - level neutrino mass .",
    "however , different from the quintuplet model , the septuplet model _ automatically _ possesses an accidental @xmath91 symmetry with action @xmath109 , and therefore always contains a stable dm candidate .",
    "this gives a common description for neutrino mass and dm without requiring any new symmetries .",
    "the dm is relatively heavy , with @xmath110  tev , due to the sommerfeld enhancement induced by @xmath92 gauge boson exchange  @xcite .",
    "detailed studies show that the variant models have large regions of viable parameter space that fit the neutrino oscillation data , reproduce the observed dm relic density , and satisfy experimental constraints from , e.g , lfv searches  @xcite . in each of the variant models ,",
    "the dm is a heavy majorana fermion and the mass for @xmath94 should obey @xmath111 , placing both multiplets beyond the reach of current colliders .",
    "however , the scalar @xmath65 can retain an @xmath112  gev mass in all cases , offering the best chance for testing the models at colliders .",
    "the models with larger @xmath95 multiplets also generate sizable contributions to lfv processes like @xmath113 .",
    "in fact , these are typically enhanced relative to the knt case , improving the prospects for testing the model in future lfv searches  @xcite . due to the new gauge interactions for the dm",
    ", direct - detection prospects also improve for the models with larger multiplets  @xcite .",
    "there are additional models of neutrino mass with dm that are related to the knt model  @xcite .",
    "for example , one can replace the internal sm leptons in figure  [ diag ] with down - type quarks , @xmath114 , and take @xmath115 and @xmath116 as colored multiplets .",
    "further colored variants are also possible  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may replace the real ( majorana ) fermion @xmath8 with a complex ( dirac ) fermion and consider a modified topology for the loop - diagram , with the dm being an inert scalar ( see figure  [ general ] for an example ) .",
    "a systematic description of these variant models appears in ref .",
    "@xcite .    , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the beyond - sm multiplets @xmath119 and @xmath23 are taken odd under a @xmath91 symmetry and the dark matter belongs to the inert doublet @xmath65.__,width=264,height=113 ]",
    "models with radiative neutrino mass offer a promising way to experimentally discern the new physics responsible for the origin of neutrino mass .",
    "three - loop models are particularly interesting as the new physics is generically expected at or around the tev scale . furthermore , such models can provide viable dm candidates , thereby solving both the neutrino mass and dm problems .",
    "here we reported recent analysis of the knt model , which show the model to be a viable theory for neutrino mass and dm that can be tested at collider experiments .",
    "we also showed that the knt model belongs to a larger class of three - loop models that can generate similarly interesting observable effects .",
