    "the focus of the paper are the standard radii measured for the family @xmath0 of convex bodies @xmath1 , where a convex body is a compact and convex set in euclidean @xmath2-space .",

    "the @xmath6 is the radius of a biggest ball contained in @xmath4 , and the @xmath7 is the radius of the ( unique ) smallest ball containing @xmath4 .",
    "a natural and very intuitive question is the following : if @xmath8 is given and we have fixed values for some of the previous radii ( say @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , which is the range of possible values of @xmath12 depending on @xmath13 and @xmath11 ?",
    "a comprehensive solution of this task in @xmath14 is presented in the following in form of a blaschke - santal diagram ( sometimes also called shape diagram ) .",
    "let us start with some historical and more general review : in @xcite blaschke proposed the study of possible values for the volume @xmath15 , surface area @xmath16 , and integral mean curvature @xmath17 for any @xmath18 .",
    "for doing so , he considered the mapping @xmath19 ^ 2 , \\text { with } h(k):=\\left(\\frac{4\\pi s(k)}{m(k)^2 } ,   \\frac{48\\pi^2 v(k)}{m(k)^3}\\right).\\ ] ] the image @xmath20 is well known as .",
    "blaschke realized that the isoperimetric inequality and the geometric inequalities of minkowski were not sufficient for a complete description of @xmath20 .",
    "a _ complete system of inequalities _ needed additional geometric inequalities relating @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , still a famous open problem in convex geometry , see @xcite .",
    "reviving the idea of blaschke , santal proposed in @xcite the study of such diagrams for all triples of the magnitudes @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath24 ( perimeter ) and @xmath25 ( area ) , for a start , for planar sets .",
    "once a triple is fixed , say @xmath26 , the function @xmath27 ^ 2 , \\text { with } g(k):=\\left(\\frac{r(k)}{r(k)},\\frac{d(k)}{2r(k)}\\right)\\ ] ] is considered , and its image @xmath28 is called a .",
    "full descriptions of those diagrams for the triples @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath26 are already derived in @xcite .",
    "an important first ingredient in the full description of the diagram for @xmath26 in @xcite are the well known ( and easy to prove ) inequalities @xmath34 as well as the inequality of jung @xcite @xmath35 which are true for all @xmath36 .",
    "moreover the validity of the inequalities @xmath37 was shown in @xcite ( there only for @xmath38 , but easy to see to be true in general dimensions , see @xcite ) .",
    "equality in holds true simultaneously , if @xmath4 is of constant width ( if @xmath39 ) .",
    "see @xcite for more details and extensions on .",
    "a final inequality derived in @xcite holds true ( in the given form ) for @xmath40 only : @xmath41 with equality , if @xmath4 is an isosceles triangle .",
    "this inequality , together with jung s inequality and the relevant parts of and forms a complete system of inequalities for @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , santal observed that previously known inequalities did not form complete systems of inequalities in any case of changing one of @xmath26 to the width @xmath12 .    in @xcite and @xcite hernndez cifre and segura gomis could state the missing inequalities : @xmath42 moreover , they showed that those of the new inequalities together with those in to , which do only involve the appropriate radii , form complete systems of inequalities for the triples @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in @xcite",
    "hernndez cifre computed complete systems of inequalities for the triples @xmath46 and @xmath47 and brczky jr . , hernndez cifre , and salinas gave complete diagrams for the triples @xmath48 and @xmath49 in @xcite .",
    "thus all 4 blaschke - santal diagrams of @xmath14 involving only the classical radii @xmath50 , and @xmath11 could be completed , but there are still 7 out of the 20 possible triples involving also @xmath25 and @xmath24 where a full description of the diagram is still missing or at least unproven .",
    "recently , blaschke - santal diagrams have been used in pattern recognition and image analysis ( see @xcite ) , as they help in the prediction of the size and shape of 3-dimensional sets from their 2-dimensional projections . in @xcite for example , the diagrams ( in this context mostly called shape - diagrams ) have been combined with probabilistic methods , such as maximum likelihood estimation in the second of them .",
    "once there are complete systems of inequalities for some of the possible triples of magnitudes amongst @xmath51 , it is a natural step to consider complete systems of inequalities for even more than three of those magnitudes , to obtain stronger inequalities or for an even more accurate classification of convex sets in the mentioned application in image analysis . in @xcite the quadruple",
    "@xmath52 has been considered , without deriving a complete description ( which is not so much surprising , as even for the triple @xmath53 a complete description is still missing ) .",
    "we consider the case @xmath54 , which is the unique diagram involving four of the above magnitudes ,  for all choices of triples of them complete descriptions of the diagrams are known . to the best of our knowledge , besides @xcite and the preliminary work of this paper in @xcite , it is the only paper considering more than three of these magnitudes .",
    "the study shows the necessity of _ new inequalities _ relating all four radii at once .",
    "this is done by describing the diagram s skeleton ,  its boundary structure consisting of 0-,1- , and 2-dimensional differential manifolds ( see below for a proper definition ) .",

    "thus we are under the conditions of lemma [ lem:3 bent isosceles ] in that case .    in the remaining cases , consider the generalized bent pentagon @xmath492 as defined in the description of the facet @xmath545 ( together with all the notation used there ) and observe that the distance @xmath596 may in any case be computed as the width in . the angle @xmath461 may become @xmath938 in case ( ii ) (  figure [ fig : genbp ] ) or the angle @xmath615 may become @xmath939 in cases ( iii ) or ( iv ) , whenever the angle between @xmath549 and @xmath239 $ ] is bigger than @xmath836 . in both cases this change of sign does not affect the final value of the right hand side of the inequality to coincide with @xmath596 .",
    "hence it suffices to show @xmath940 . for this assume",
    "that @xmath260 $ ] is horizontal and below @xmath292 , that @xmath941 , and that @xmath942 .    in case of",
    "( ii ) , part ( a ) of lemma [ lem : lb3properties ] ensures that @xmath260 $ ] does not intersect @xmath909 .",
    "thus the slope of the @xmath588 s is negative , and considering the line @xmath81 containing @xmath260 $ ] , the angle between @xmath549 and @xmath239 $ ] is smaller than the angle between @xmath81 and @xmath239 $ ] (  figure [ fig : genbp ] ) .",
    "hence , denoting the line containing @xmath119 and parallel to @xmath81 by @xmath236 , their distance satisfies @xmath943 .",
    "now , let us assume that ( iii ) is true , but not ( ii ) .",
    "then we know from part ( b ) of lemma [ lem : lb3properties ] , that the distance @xmath596 decreases if @xmath121 decreases . using @xmath944 we obtain @xmath945[\\gamma_r ] )",
    "= 2r \\le w$ ] .",
    "finally , for the treatment of ( iv ) , one should first observe two easy facts : first , since @xmath946 and @xmath933 we have @xmath947 $ ] and second if @xmath948 , and @xmath949 are the according support lines of @xmath291 , then @xmath949 are perpendicular to @xmath239 $ ] and thus @xmath616=w(\\h)=2r(\\h)$ ] (  the description of @xmath291 in subsection [ ss : vertices ] ) . from ( iv ) and inequality we obtain that @xmath950 and since @xmath239 $ ] is the shorter edge of @xmath343 we have @xmath616=\\nicefrac{d}{r}\\,\\sqrt{4r^2-d^2}$ ] which is a decreasing function on @xmath10 . hence @xmath616 $ ] is maximized , when @xmath951 , when @xmath616 = w(\\h)$ ] . thus using inequality",
    "we obtain @xmath952\\leq w(\\h)=2r(\\h)\\leq 2r\\leq w,\\ ] ] which completes the proof .",
    "for finishing the paper , let us give two final remarks :    first , for some practical purposes it could be of some value to be able to replace the sometimes quite unhandy non - linear inequalities by linear ones . thus knowing the full extend of the diagram",
    "know , it would be worthwhile to develope a complete system of linear inequalities supporting the diagram . since the convex hull of the vertices does not contain the full diagram ( the supporting plane of @xmath953 , and @xmath219 separates @xmath383 from major parts of the diagram ) and since all edges and facets are smooth , this system can not be finite .",
    "second , especially considering the application of blaschke - santal diagrams given in @xcite , consider the following problem : suppose two convex sets @xmath4 and @xmath874 are mapped to the same point in the diagram , how `` different '' may @xmath4 and @xmath874 be ? before giving any answer to this question , we should first develope an idea , how to measure this `` difference '' . for this neither the usual hausdorff nor the banach - mazur distance can be taken . for the hausdorff distance any @xmath4 and some of its rotations may be quite far from each other , while the banach - mazur distance would mark ( ) all simplices equal . a good choice for this task could be taking the hausdorff distance within the class of similarities of the two sets .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , this distance is not considered in literature so far .",
