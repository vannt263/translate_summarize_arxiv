    "massive black hole _ binaries _ are considered to be a direct outcome of galaxy mergers .",
    "they form in the advanced stages of the galactic interaction as soon as the mass of the two black holes ( bhs ) exceeds the gas / stellar mass enclosed within their orbit , on scales of @xmath6 pc ( begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ; merritt & milosavljevic 2005 ; mayer et al . 2007 ; colpi & dotti 2009 ) . in gas rich environments and in the advanced stages of bh hardening ,",
    "the binary is likely to be surrounded by a circum - binary accretion disc . in the interaction with the disc the binary transfers orbital angular momentum through gravitational torques after having excavated a gap , i.e. a hollow density region ( e.g. artymovicz & lubow 1994 ) .",
    "migration of the secondary bh toward the primary is then regulated by the rate at which viscous torques in the disc respond to the tidal field of the binary .",
    "if migration continues to be effective the bh binary is expected to enter the gravitational wave ( gw ) driven regime , and the transit to this state is expected to be the longest - lived one ( e.g. ivanov et al .",

    "the observability of bh binaries with separations @xmath7 pc , at the stage of disc / gw driven migration , is the focus of our study .",
    "sub - parsec binary agn , if the bhs are active , can be viewed as key tracers of galactic mergers along the co - evolution of bhs and spheroids ( ferrarese & ford 2005 ) .",
    "direct imaging of binary agn on parsec scales however can be carried on , in the near universe , only in the radio band , when both bhs are active , thanks to the use of radio interferometers such as the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "this technique needs to point precisely at the source whose position in the sky should be known in advance .",
    "so far , this method yielded one candidate , 0402 + 379 , a source with two compact radio cores seen at a projected separation of @xmath8 pc , representing the closest system imaged to date ( rodriguez et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies may provide an alternative method for revealing binary agn , at even closer separations , through the search of velocity shifts in the multiple line systems resulting from the keplerian motion of the two bhs .",
    "peculiar spectra with large velocity shifts of the order of @xmath9 are easily selected among thousands of quasar spectra , and five spectroscopic bh binary candidates have been found so far in the public archives of sdss survey : j092712.65 + 294344.0 ( bogdanovic et al .",

    "we further note that despite it s simplicity this method is biased in favour of binary systems whose orbital configuration maximizes the velocity shifts between different line systems .",
    "moreover it can not be applied to search for bhb candidates at redshift @xmath10 since the rest - frame wavelength of the main narrow emission lines is @xmath11  .    in light of these findings , is it still possible to identify other complementary signatures of a binary system at the stage of viscous - driven migration or gw - inspiral ?    high resolution numerical simulations can play an important role in predicting the electromagnetic signatures associated with binary systems .",
    "nevertheless hydrodynamical simulations with full radiative transfer are still out of reach due to the very high computational cost . as illustrated in bogdanovic et al .",
    "( 2008 ; 2009b ) , the use of photoionization codes in combination with hydrodynamical simulations allows to analyse the observational features of a sub - pc binary system , interacting with a gaseous disc , just for few orbital periods .",
    "relying on a different approach , shen & loeb ( 2009 ) studied the potential signature left in the spectra by two active bhs surrounded by bel clouds that initially are inside the hole s hill spheres .",
    "the spectra display double peaked features which over years show coherent radial velocity drifts due to the keplerian motion .",
    "however , since bels carry individually large widths , only in a restricted range of binary separations bels display line - of - sight orbital velocity differences larger than that of their intrinsic fwhm .",
    "furthermore , line profiles become complex as soon as the two blrs start to move in the combined gravitational potential of the bh binary .    here",
    "we devise a new approach to search for bhb candidates starting from single - epoch , optical spectroscopy datasets , relying on the possibility that the presence of a binary system can affect the flux ratios between broad emission lines .",
    "we explore the case where one bh ( the lighter secondary ) is active after the bh binary has cleared a gap inside the circum - binary disc , and compute line flux ratios emerging from a bel system anchored to the secondary bh .",
    "this configuration differs from that considered in bogdanovic et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and in shen & loeb ( 2009 ) and is motivated by the results of previous numerical studies on the evolution of black hole binary systems within gaseous environment .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we briefly describe the accretion and bh binary evolution model . in section [",
    "sec : method ] we describe how we model the blr and compute the flux ratios of different lines using the photoionization code cloudy . in section [ sec : results ] we present our results .",
    "the possible use of these results as tool in the search of new secure spectroscopic bhb candidates is described in section [ sec : search ] . in section [ sec : discussion ] are our discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "consider a circular bh binary with semimajor axis @xmath12 and mass ratio @xmath13 between the secondary ( @xmath14 ) and primary ( @xmath15 ) bh , and let @xmath16 , in accordance with recent findings that indicate the formation of close bh pairs ( and so of binaries ) only in mergers with sufficiently large mass ratios to avoid premature disruption of the less massive galaxy by tides and ram - pressure stripping ( kazantzidis et al . 2005 ; callegari et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the bh binary is assumed to be embedded in a circum - binary geometrically thin accretion disc coplanar with the orbital plane of the bh binary ( ivanov et al .",
    "1999 ) . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the binary strongly perturbs the disc by exchanging angular momentum with the gas and excavates a gap , i.e. a cavity extending up to @xmath18 , where @xmath12 is the orbital separation ( e.g. artymovicz & lubow 1994 ) .",
    "following gap opening , the primary , left in a state of low accretion , consumes most of its disc over the inner viscous time scale . the secondary , instead , that moves closer to the inner rim of the circum - binary disc , has lower speed relative to the gas , and continues to accrete higher density material growing its own disc ( e.g. hayasaki et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ; cuadra et al . 2009 ) .",
    "here we work under the hypothesis that the lighter secondary is the only active member of the binary , and that a bel system is maintained around the secondary bh , through binary evolution .",
    "bel - clouds orbit inside the roche lobe of @xmath19 and their localized emission represents here the main contribution to the emitted spectrum as it originates in the high density region of the inner disc bound to @xmath20 . due to the orbital decay induced by viscous torques or gw emission , the roche radius @xmath21 $ ] ( eggleton 1983 ) decreases and we expect a progressive erosion of the blr : the blr gas , no longer bound to the secondary bh , experiences , outside @xmath22 , the tidal torque from the binary and is dragged away .",
    "we thus work under the hypothesis that the blr is tidally truncated at @xmath22 as the binary orbit shrinks under the action of external torques .    in the interpretation of the results it is important to define a particular phase , referred to as binary - disc decoupling",
    ", that occurs at the bridge between the viscous and the gw driven domains .",
    "as described in haiman , kocsis & menou ( 2009 ) , there exists a time in which the inner edge of the circum - binary thin disc can no longer follow the migration of the secondary as the inward viscous diffusion timescale in the disc becomes longer than the timescale of gw - driven inspiral ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "at such a separation the circum - binary disc decouples and the secondary might be no longer fueled . in this case , from the decoupling time on , the secondary active bh is expected to consume its disc on a timescale that is @xmath24 ( see eq .",
    "21 of haiman et al .",
    "2009 for an expression of the viscous time in the case of a steady - state thin accretion disc ) .",
    "thus we can assume that the activity of the secondary bh can be sustained throughout the binary orbital decay .",
    "the question we want to address is the following : is there an observable signature in the emitted spectrum associated to this evolutionary scenario ?",
    "we expect that the emission from the peripheral bels becomes inefficient below some critical orbital separation",
    ". this can be especially relevant for low - ionization lines , such as that of mgii and @xmath1 , in comparison to high - ionization ones , since the former are emitted preferentially at greater distances from the source of the ionizing flux .",
    "to this purpose , in the next section we devise a method to compute the expected effects of the blr tidal truncation on the flux ratios .",
    "we consider three of the most prominent blr lines observed in the spectra of agns : civ , mgii and @xmath1 .",
    "we then focus on the flux ratios between those lines that can be simultaneously observed in an optical survey , such as the sdss , up to redshift @xmath25 .",
    "in particular we compute the flux ratios between the lines of mgii and civ ( @xmath2 ) and those of mgii and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the flux ratios are calculated for different sizes of the blr around the secondary according to the scenario outlined above . for a circular binary of mass ratio @xmath26 , secondary mass @xmath20 and separation @xmath12",
    ", the blr is truncated at the roche radius @xmath22 .",
    "the secondary is assumed to emit a luminosity @xmath27 with a constant eddington factor @xmath28 .",
    "the greatest orbital separation @xmath29 is set under the assumption that @xmath30 coincides with the size @xmath31 of a blr of an isolated bh accreting at @xmath28 as expected from the observational relation of @xmath31 with the luminosity at 5100  ( kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ) , considering @xmath32 ( kaspi et al . 2000 ) .    in order to compute the flux ratios at each separation ,",
    "i.e. at each orbital period @xmath33 , we use the photoionization code cloudy ( version 08.00 ; ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) . to map the bels we refer to the `` locally optimally cloud '' model ( loc ; e.g. baldwin et al . 1995 ) . following korista et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and korista & goad ( 2000 ) , we compute a grid of photoionization models assuming each cloud as a slab of constant gas density with solar metallicity and a clear view to the ionizing flux . the shape of the ionizing continuum is taken as one of the templates for a radio - quiet active galaxy stored as part of the cloudy code .",
    "the column density is set to @xmath34 and is kept fixed for all clouds .",
    "we consider the contribution of clouds with @xmath35 and hydrogen ionizing flux @xmath36 ) give a very low contribution to the emission and form graphite grains , while the absence of broad forbidden lines implies that clouds with lower density are not present . ] according to the loc model the main properties of quasar spectra are dominated by selection effects of atomic physics and radiative transfer that determine , for each individual blr cloud , the reprocessing efficiency of the ionizing continuum into line radiation . in this contest",
    ", it is assumed that there exists a spread in gas properties at each radius in the blr .",
    "therefore in order to compute the total bels flux , we have to consider the contribution of each cloud lying in the density - flux plane spanned by the photoionization grid models .",
    "in particular it was shown that one can sum over all these contributions by making the simplifying assumption that clouds are distributed in gas density and distance following a weighting function separable in both variables ( e.g. baldwin et al . 1997 ) .. both geometries imply a high covering factor which is in agreement with the observations ( e.g. gaskell 2009 ) . on the other hand a high covering factor and a disc like geometry imply that the effect of cloud self - shielding may become relevant . in this case",
    "it has been shown that regions emitting bels of different ionization potential are more clearly spatially separated ( gaskell 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "we expect that accounting for blr self - shielding the effect of the the blr erosion on the @xmath2 ratio would be even stronger than what obtained in our calculations . ]    in our study , we consider the case of a uniform distribution of cloud distances and densities , and a second case in which the weighting function is a power law with index -1 in both variables ( power - law model , here on ) .",
    "we set the density range for the two different distributions such that at the largest orbital separation the computed flux ratios are consistent with the typical values observed in the agn spectra , in particular : @xmath37 for the homogeneous model , and @xmath38 for the power - law model .",
    "considering the adopted cloud distributions in density and space , the resulting mean number density as function of distance are : @xmath39 , constant with radius for the uniform blr model , and @xmath40 for the power law case , where @xmath41 is the inner blr radius . in the power law case",
    "the contribution from higher density gas at greater distances is less relevant than in the uniform model .",
    "the need of a higher density limit in the power law model to reproduce the observed values of the @xmath2 ratio can be therefore understood considering that the mgii line is more efficiently reprocessed at higher densities and lower fluxes than that of civ .",
    "figure [ fig : period ] shows the flux ratios @xmath2 and @xmath42 as a function of the keplerian orbital period of the bh binary , for @xmath16 and for a secondary with @xmath43 the upper panel refers to the case of uniformly distributed blr clouds , while the lower to the power - law model .",
    "we find that the ratio @xmath2 is a decreasing function of the orbital separation , and so of @xmath44 , and therefore it can be regarded as a possible diagnostic tool in the spectroscopic search of binary systems ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : search ] ) . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath42 ratio is fairly constant apart from a sharp decline present only in the case of a uniform clouds distribution , that will be discussed below .",
    "therefore @xmath42 is not sensitive to the truncation of the blr while @xmath2 shows lower values for closer separations in both blr models and is already reduced of an order of magnitude before the drop that occurs in the uniform distribution case .",
    "these results are consistent with what expected considering that lines of different ionization potential , such as those of civ and mgii , are preferentially emitted in spatially separated regions . as mentioned before , in the case of a uniform blr , both flux ratios decrease rapidly around a critical orbital period @xmath45 .",
    "this rapid decay is not observed for the case of a power - law blr distribution . as described in section 3",
    ", observations require that the blr cloud density does not exceed @xmath46 for the uniform model .",
    "higher densities needed in the power - law model can still contribute to the mgii line emission at closer orbital separations , preventing the occurrence of the drop in the line flux ratio .",
    "however we expect to observe at most a few binary systems at such small periods ( @xmath47 ) because of the short coalescing timescale for gw emission .",
    "vertical lines refer to the orbital period @xmath48 , for a selected binary , below which the binary decouples from the circum - binary disc .",
    "as described in section [ sec : model ] , at this stage the bh binary is already in the gw - driven inspiral regime and in figure 1 we report the corresponding times for gw - driven coalescence , in the range @xmath49 .",
    "this critical period is computed following haiman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for a steady geometrically thin accretion disc ( see their equations 30 ) .",
    "we notice that for the parameters chosen in our calculation the binary - disc decoupling occurs at @xmath50 where there is more chance to observe binary systems and the values of the @xmath2 ratio can be already reduced up to an order of magnitude , as discussed before .",
    "figure [ fig : velocity ] carries the same information of figure [ fig : period ] but expresses the decrease in the flux ratios as a function of the velocity of the secondary bh relative to the center of mass of the binary .",
    "the velocity is in principle measurable as doppler shift between the bels and the narrow emission lines ( nels ) that are emitted from gas at much larger distances and that provide the rest - frame redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "the velocity reported in figure [ fig : velocity ] refers to the maximum observable velocity offset , corresponding to a binary seen edge - on and at at one of the two orbital nodes , and can exceed @xmath51 in the region of interest .",
    "figure [ fig : fedd ] illustrates the effect of varying the eddington factor for the case of a secondary with @xmath52 , @xmath16 and for a uniform blr .",
    "the flux ratios curves shift to shorter periods for lower eddington factors .",
    "the unperturbed outer radius of the blr of the secondary is proportional to its luminosity through the @xmath53 relation of kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , as in the case of isolated bhs .",
    "this implies that the smaller blr of a secondary accreting at a lower pace starts to be tidally perturbed at smaller binary separations . on the other hand for lower values of @xmath28",
    "the binary - disc decoupling may occur at greater orbital separations , due to the longer viscous time scale . as will be discussed in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "this may affect the relevance of the possible contribution to the observed bels from the circum - binary disc , not included in our work .",
    "the huge quantity of data collected by recent surveys give a unique chance to look for the still elusive observational evidences of close bh binary systems .",
    "this opportunity leads us to consider the possible implications of our results in the spectroscopic search of new bhb candidates among the public archive of the sdss survey .",
    "firstly we notice that the wavelength range covered by the sdss does not allow to simultaneously observe both line ratios considered in our work",
    ". in particular , it is possible to measure the ratio @xmath4 for those sources in the redshift bin between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , while the ratio @xmath2 targets objects at redshifts @xmath25 . among the three lines considered here only @xmath56",
    "is emitted both in the blr and the nlr .",
    "accordingly , measures of @xmath4 with a lower value than observed for isolated agn , around redshift @xmath57 accompanied by the rapid periodic luminosity variability and velocity offset between bels and nels are in favour of the bh binary hypothesis ( we refer to sec . [",
    "sec : discussion ] for a more detailed discussion on these last two spectroscopic signatures ) .",
    "however it has to be taken into account that the expected number of sub - pc binary systems at low redshift is at most of the order of a few ( volonteri , miller & dotti 2009 ) .    on the other hand , at higher redshift , @xmath58 , where the predicted number of such systems increases , the observation of reduced @xmath2 can be indicative of the presence of a bh binary and",
    "can be confirmed again by searching for luminosity variability on scale @xmath5 years .",
    "we further notice that at redshifts @xmath59 it is difficult to find evidences of velocity offsets between bels and nels since the wavelength of the most common nels is longer than @xmath60 3000 (e.g .",
    "osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) .",
    "the signature of binary orbital motion in the agn spectrum at redshift @xmath61 would require spectroscopic studies in the ir band .",
    "therefore our results can be useful to look for bhb candidates in a redshift range that has been not yet explored .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] represents the normalized distribution of the ratio @xmath2 for 5820 quasars at @xmath62 from sdss dr6 catalog .",
    "the median value of the distribution ( @xmath63 ) is marked by the solid vertical line .",
    "about 500 objects located on the left of the dashed vertical line are characterized by a flux ratio value of a factor of @xmath64 lower that what typically observed .",
    "the existence of these peculiar sources offers a key chance to test the findings of our study .",
    "hence we intend to analyse in a following work ( montuori et al .",
    ", in prep ) the spectroscopic optical ( rest - frame ) features of bhb candidates selected among those objects which in fig . [ fig : distribution ] show unusually reduced values of @xmath2 .",
    "nir observations of these selected sources will allow to measure velocity off - sets between bels and nels , in particular between the @xmath1 and @xmath65_{\\lambda 5007}}$ ] lines .",
    "according to our model hypothesis , the spectra of a massive bh binary , at the orbital stage of viscous / gw driven migration , show decreased line flux ratios , compared to what observed for single black holes , due to the erosion of the blr at the roche lobe radius of the active secondary . in light of our findings , agn spectra characterized by @xmath66 could be interpreted as a signature of bh binaries with separations in the range of @xmath67 , and orbital periods @xmath44 between @xmath68 yr , depending on the total binary mass in the range of @xmath69 .",
    "this flux decrease amounts to nearly three orders of magnitude for binary systems at the shortest separations , in the case of bels emitted by a uniform distribution of cloud properties . for clouds with steeper distributions in space and density the flux ratios",
    "can be diminished of a factor @xmath70    we note that the flux ratio is particularly low when the bhb is in the the short - lived evolutionary stage of gw inspiral . in this phase",
    ", the binary often reaches the critical orbital distance below which the circum - binary disc decouples from the inspiralling bhs .",
    "this can be important when considering the potential contributions to the observed bels not included in our calculations .",
    "depending on the uncertain physical conditions of the gas in the surroundings of the binary ( e.g. , disc orientation relative to the binary orbital plane , disc geometry , degree of illumination / ionization ) the gas located at the inner edge of the circum - binary disc may contribute to the bels , making the predicted diminished values of the flux ratios more difficult to observe .",
    "we expect however a weakening of the potential emission from clouds residing in the circum - binary disc , should the emission be present , since the disc edge freezes and the distance between the emitting bh and this gas keeps increasing .",
    "all the results discussed in our work assume binary systems on circular orbits as bh inspiral in rotating discs leads to circularization of the initial orbit ( dotti et al . 2006 ; 2007 ; 2009b ) .",
    "after gap opening however , the interaction of the binary with the circumbinary disc drives the growth of every small residual eccentricity up to a limiting value of @xmath71 ( armitage & natarajan 2005 ; cuadra et al .",
    "such a small eccentricity implies a pericenter of the binary orbit @xmath72 times smaller than the semimajor axis .",
    "if the disc is tidally truncated at the pericenter and has no time to re - expand at apocenter ( e.g. due to periodic accretion from the circumbinary disc ) the line ratios would be the same as those corresponding to a slightly closer binary .",
    "the period of the binary would be at most twice longer than what expected from the line ratios assuming circular orbits . as a consequence",
    ", longer observations would be required to observe the periodicity signatures in the line shifts and in the accretion luminosities discussed hereafter .",
    "low values of the line flux ratios should be accompanied by at least one or two of the following signatures .",
    "the first signature would be the presence of de - projected velocity offsets between the bels and the nels up to @xmath73 .",
    "the second would be a change in luminosity over the orbital period @xmath44 .",
    "bogdanovic et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and haiman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggested that the accretion rate on the active bh can be modulated on the timescale of the binary orbital period .",
    "the line emission features investigated in our study are occurring at orbital periods of the order of months to years .",
    "as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , there is little chance to observe binary systems with periods @xmath74 yr due to their shorter lifetimes .",
    "therefore we expect that periodicity both in velocity - offsets and in continuum luminosity can be used to verify the binary hypothesis through spectral monitoring of binary systems on timescales @xmath75 yr , as it would be feasible for example in the case of a bhb with @xmath76 at @xmath77 yr when @xmath78 yr .",
    "can these features possibly disentangle genuine binary candidates from the case of a recoiling bh ?",
    "the signature of a periodicity in the bels is not expected in the case of a recoiling bh .",
    "the bh ejected from the nucleus of the host galaxy after binary coalescence would carry away a disc with an outer radius of the order of @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the mass and the velocity of the recoiling bh , respectively .",
    "numerical simulations in general relativity show that the maximum predicted value for the kick velocity is @xmath82 ( lousto et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "this would correspond to the minimum outer radius for the disc bound to the ejected bh , @xmath83 , that we can compare with the blr radius , @xmath31 , for an isolated bh , considering three different values for the mass of the bh remnant,@xmath84 .",
    "we find @xmath85 for @xmath86 . in this case",
    "we expect that the line ratios between the low and the high ionization lines do not differ from what observed in the case of a standard agn .",
    "this is a first study that aimed at exploring the potential effect of the erosion of the bel system due to orbital motion around a bh binary with only one bh active ( the secondary ) .",
    "our next step will focus on the emission of transient streams of matter inflowing from the circum - binary disc on to the bhs ( bogdanovic et al . 2009 ; cuadra et al . 2009 ) , the presence of lower density gas in the gap region ( dotti et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the shape of the emission lines as function of the blr geometry and dynamics .    as an example",
    "we notice that the binary candidate 4c+22.25 , described in the recent work of decarli et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , can represent an ideal case to test and improve the predictions of our study .",
    "the binary model consistent with the observations of this source requires the presence of a single active bh , which is supposed to be the secondary , a total mass of @xmath87 and an orbital period of the order of @xmath88 yr . according to our findings ,",
    "these orbital parameters imply that the blr of the active bh is tidally perturbed with respect to the case of an isolated agn . as already reported in the letter of decarli et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , one of the peculiarities of the optical spectrum of 4c+22.25 is that the bels are very broad and faint .",
    "this can be interpreted as a further observational evidence of the truncation of the secondary blr that is present together with the reduced flux ratios .",
    "further observations of the source , possibly at different wavelengths , will help to constrain the binary model and in particular the scenario proposed in our work , for example through the analysis of bel profiles and of flux ratios between bels of different ionization potential .",
