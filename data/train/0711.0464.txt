    "<S> this paper presents some parallel developments in quiver / dimer models , hypergeometric systems and dessins denfants . </S>",
    "<S> it demonstrates that the setting in which gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky have formulated the theory of hypergeometric systems , provides also a natural setting for dimer models . </S>",
    "<S> the fast inverse algorithm of @xcite and the untwisting procedure of @xcite are recasted in this more natural setting and then immediately produce from the quiver data the kasteleyn matrix for dimer models , which is best viewed as the bi - adjacency matrix for the untwisted model . </S>",
    "<S> some perfect matchings in the dimer models are direct reformulations of the triangulations in gkz theory and the rule which maps triangulations to the vertices of the secondary polygon extends to a rule for mapping perfect matchings to lattice points in the secondary polygon . finally it is observed in many examples and then conjectured to hold in general , that the determinant of the kasteleyn matrix with suitable weights becomes after a simple transformation equal to the principal @xmath0-determinant in gkz theory . </S>",
    "<S> illustrative examples are distributed throughout the text . </S>"
