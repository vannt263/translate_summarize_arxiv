    "scalar - field condensations play very crucial roles in various places in cosmology .",
    "probably the most important example is the inflaton field which is necessary for inflation @xcite . in particular , in the slow - roll inflation models @xcite , energy density of the inflaton condensation provides the energy density to realize ( quasi- ) de - sitter universe during inflation .",
    "after inflation , the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of the potential and decays into standard - model particles to reheat the universe realizing hot big - bang cosmology . this class of inflation model not only solves flatness and horizon problems in cosmology but also provides density fluctuation consistent with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been pointed out that the density fluctuation may arise from late - decaying scalar field other than the inflaton , which is called `` curvaton '' @xcite .",
    "other important example is the affleck - dine field for baryogenesis @xcite . in low - energy supersymmetric models , there exist scalar fields , i.e. , scalar partners of quarks , which have baryon number .",
    "if some of those fields acquire non - vanishing amplitudes in the early universe , non - vanishing baryon number may be imprinted into the motion of the scalar - quark condensations due to baryon - number violating operators at an ultra - high energy scale .",
    "such a scenario is one of the most attractive scenario to generate large enough baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "all of these exotic scalar - field condensations ( i.e , inflaton , curvaton , affleck - dine field , and so on ) oscillate around the minimum of the potential at some stage of the evolution of the universe , and eventually decay into standard - model particles for the cosmological history consistent with observations .",
    "thus , it is important to understand how the scalar - field condensation decays from the view point of the quantum field theory .",
    "the main concern of this paper is to discuss how the oscillating scalar - field condensation decays into other states . around the minimum",
    ", the potential of the scalar field @xmath3 is well estimated by a parabolic one @xmath4 neglecting the effect of the cosmic expansion for simplicity , the solution to the classical equation of motion is given by @xmath5 in this case , the energy density of the condensation is given by @xmath6 .",
    "one should understand how the energy density stored in the oscillation of @xmath3 is converted to the that of radiation . in the simplest approach , the decay rate of the scalar - field condensation is estimated from the decay rate of single scalar field ( in the vacuum ) : the energy density of the scalar field in the condensation is approximated to decrease as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the decay rate of @xmath3 in the vacuum .",
    "however , it has been also pointed out that , when the scalar field @xmath3 is oscillating like eq .",
    "( [ cos(mt ) ] ) , wave functions of fields which couple to @xmath3 are modified .",
    "consequently , the `` decay rate '' of the scalar field in the condensation may be significantly different from the one obtained from the field theory in the vacuum .",
    "in particular , in some of the cases , instability band may arise in the wave function of the final - state particles , which results in catastrophic particle production ( so - called parametric resonance ) @xcite . since the decay of scalar - field condensation is very important , it is desirable to have a deep understanding of the decay processes of scalar - field oscillations in the framework of well - established quantum field theory .    in this paper",
    ", we consider decay processes of scalar condensations in the framework of the quantum field theory . in our analysis , we neglect the effects of cosmic expansion as a first step to understand the behavior of the scalar condensation .",
    "we postulate that the scalar condensation corresponds to the so - called coherent state @xmath9 in the quantum field theory ; justification of such a treatment will be also discussed .",
    "then , we will show that the decay rate of the coherent state can be systematically calculated by using the unitarity relation of the scattering matrix ( @xmath10-matrix ) . by using the fact that the decay rate of the coherent state is proportional to the imaginary part of the so - called @xmath11-matrix element @xmath12 $ ]",
    ", we formulate the calculation of the decay rate of the coherent state .",
    "we apply our procedure to the case where the scalar - field condensation is coupled to a real scalar field and calculate the decay rate for such a case .",
    "we will see that our procedure gives the same decay rate as that obtained by the discussion of parametric - resonance .",
    "we discuss when eq .",
    "( [ dot(rho ) ] ) is justified and how the instability band for parametric resonance arises in our framework .",
    "we also calculate the decay rate of scalar condensation which decays into gauge - boson pair via anomaly .",
    "organization of this paper is as follows . in section[sec : basic ] , we first derive basic formulae which are used in the calculation of the decay rate of the coherent state .",
    "in particular , we define the coherent state @xmath9 in the quantum field theory and present important properties of @xmath9 . then , we explain how the decay rate of the state @xmath9 is obtained . in section  [ sec : a - term ] , we consider the case where the condensation couples to a real scalar field @xmath13 via three - point interaction .",
    "decay of the coherent state via the interaction induced by the anomaly is discussed in section  [ sec : anomaly ] . in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results .",
    "in this section , we introduce basic formulae used in our analysis .",
    "we discuss how the condensation of scalar field decays via some interaction .",
    "we assume that the interaction of the scalar field is weak enough",
    ".    total decay rate of any state can be related to the imaginary part of the scattering - matrix element due to the @xmath10-matrix unitarity .",
    "let us denote the @xmath10-matrix as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the unit operator and the so - called @xmath11-matrix , respectively .",
    "( here and hereafter , the `` hat '' is used for operators . )",
    "then , from the unitarity of the @xmath10-matrix , the following relation holds : @xmath17 this relation is important for our analysis .",
    "we expect that there exists a quantum state @xmath9 which describes the state with scalar condensation .",
    "( details about @xmath9 will be explained below . )",
    "the probability of the state @xmath9 decaying into all the possible final states is related to the imaginary part of the @xmath11-matrix element as @xmath18.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , we consider what the state @xmath9 is .",
    "we first quantize the field operator using the free part of the lagrangian , then treat the interaction terms as perturbations .",
    "we denote the free part of the lagrangian of the real scalar field @xmath3 as @xmath19 in our analysis , we use the box normalization of the wave functions with the volume @xmath20 . then , the field operator is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the annihilation and creation operators satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath23 = \\delta_{{\\bf k } , { \\bf k'}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( as well as @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) commute .",
    "we postulate that the quantum state describing the scalar - field condensation is the coherent state , which is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the vacuum state satisfying @xmath30 .",
    "notice that the state @xmath9 is properly normalized : @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , importantly , the state @xmath9 is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath32 : @xmath33 we can also see that @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 one can easily see that , for the coherent state @xmath9 , the expectation value of the field operator follows the trajectory of the solution to the classical wave equation .",
    "thus , we expect that the coherent state @xmath9 corresponds to the quantum state where the scalar field is under oscillation .    in calculating @xmath11-matrix elements , it is necessary to calculate the expectation values of time - ordered products of field operators . by using the wick s theorem ,",
    "such products are calculated as @xmath37 where the symbol @xmath11 here denotes the time - ordering while @xmath38 is for normal - ordering .",
    "in addition , in the second equality , we have used eq .",
    "( [ a|phi > ] ) . even in more complicated cases ,",
    "we obtain @xmath39_{\\varphi ( x_i ) }     \\left (   \\hat{\\varphi } ( x_i ) - \\varphi ( x_i )",

    "then , @xmath42 , and eq .  ( [ wicks2 ] ) is applicable even when the function @xmath43 is singular at @xmath44 .    in the following",
    ", we will not consider the processes in which @xmath3 is produced due to the decay of the coherent state .",
    "( the inclusion of such processes is straightforward . ) in such a case , propagator of @xmath3 does not show up in the calculation and the field operator @xmath45 can be simply replaced by the expectation value @xmath46 , in which the contraction terms are irrelevant .",
    "it is also instructive to calculate the expectation values of energy - density operator as @xmath47 while the expectation value of the number density is also given by @xmath48    for the complex scalar field ( which we denote as @xmath49 ) , similar argument applies .",
    "we define the field operator for the complex scalar field as @xmath50 where @xmath24 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) are annihilation ( creation ) operators .",
    "the coherent state for the complex field is given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 energy density of this state is given by @xmath57 while we can also calculate the expectation values of the number densities of particle @xmath49 and anti - particle @xmath58 as @xmath59 we can see that the number densities of @xmath49 and its anti - particle are proportional to @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "thus , when @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath49 is more ( less ) abundant than @xmath58 in the condensation . it should be also noted that the function @xmath64 given in eq .",
