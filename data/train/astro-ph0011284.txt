    "the non - thermal @xmath0-ray spectrum of gamma - ray burst sources ( grbs ) is thought to arise in shocks which develop beyond the radius at which the relativistic fireball from the initial event has become optically thin to scattering .",
    "however , the observed spectra are hard , with a significant fraction of the energy above the @xmath4 formation energy threshold , and a high compactness parameter can result in new pairs being formed outside the originally optically thin shocks responsible for the primary radiation .",
    "new pairs can be made as some of the initial energetic photons are backscattered and interact with other incoming photons .",
    "such effects have been considered by madau & thompson ( 2000 ) and thompson & madau ( 2000 ) , who investigated the acceleration of new pairs for a particular fireball model .",
    "dermer & bttcher ( 2000 ) considered the effect of pair formation for an external shock model of grb , in which the compactness parameter is relatively low , while madau , blandford & rees ( 2000 ) investigated the effects of compton echos produced by pairs .    here",
    "we present a simplified discussion of the generic effects of pair formation in a specific class of models .",
    "we suppose that the central engine gives rise to an unsteady baryonic wind , which is relativistic , carries a magnetic field , and lasts for a time @xmath5 . a fraction of the wind energy is converted into @xmath0-rays via internal shocks ; the remaining wind energy drives a blast wave which decelerates as it sweeps up the external medium , and gives rise to the afterglow emission .",
    "the @xmath0-rays would propagate ahead of the blast wave , leading to pair production ( and an associated deposition of momentum ) into the external medium .",
    "the pair cascades saturate after the external ( pair - enriched ) medium reaches a critical bulk lorentz factor , which is generally below that of the original relativistic wind . for external baryonic densities similar to those in molecular clouds the pairs can achieve scattering optical depths @xmath6 . even for less extreme external densities the effect of the additional pairs can be substantial , increasing the radiative efficiency of the blast wave and leading to distortions of the original spectrum .",
    "this provides a potential tool for diagnosing the compactness parameter of the bursts and thus the radial distance at which shocks producing an observed luminosity can occur .",
    "it also provides a tool for diagnosing the baryonic density of the external environment of the bursts , and testing the association with star - forming regions .",

    "the specific nature of this spectral modification depends on the value of the luminosity , which influences ( equation [ [ eq : rcpp ] ] ) the bulk lorentz factor of the reprocessing pair cloud before it has been swept up by the ejecta , and also on the extent to which the outflow is beamed .",
    "one of the consequences of such a critical external density leading to @xmath96 would be the presence of an x - ray quasi - thermal pulse , whose total energy may be a few percent of the total burst energy . in the case of even more extreme densities ,",

    "for instance , dense blobs of fe - enriched thermal plasma would emit strong recombination features , as well as annihilation radiation features , if the normal electron density were augmented by extra pairs .    even in isotropic situations ,",
    "the spectrum would be modified by transmission through a pair plasma of optical depth unity .",
    "the effect is maximal for photons of energy @xmath176 in the frame of the pair plasma : for higher energies , the klein - nishina cross - section is smaller ; for lower energies , the scatterings are almost elastic .",
    "if , for instance , @xmath177 , the gamma - ray spectrum around photon energies @xmath178 mev would be depressed by a factor @xmath179 relative to its original value , smoothly rejoining its original value above and below that energy . for a beamed primary output , however , there would be a suppression at lower energies ( where the scattering is in the thompson regime ) because the scattered photons would be spread over a wider angle .",
    "pair - induced processes would therefore yield evidence on the beaming properties of the bursts .",
    "irrespective of the external density , the processes discussed here suggest that bursts and afterglows may have a more complex spectrum and time - structure than standard models suggest .",
    "but the effects are especially interesting when the external density is high : they probe the environment of grbs , and thus can offer clues to the nature of the progenitor stars , and their location within the host galaxy .",
    "for instance , a quasi - thermal x - ray pulse accompanying the gamma - ray emission could be indicative of an external circum - burst density of at least @xmath180 . while quasi - thermal x - ray pulses might also arise due to other reasons , e.g. from an underlying optically thick central engine , if the x - ray luminosity scales as equation ( [ eq : xrprec ] ) and is accompanied by radio or far - ir signals such as in equations ( [ eq : nusyr])([eq : nusyf ] ) , this could be indicative of birth in a dense environment from a massive progenitor .",
    "detailed monte carlo simulations ( ramirez - ruiz , 2001 ) should provide a more detailed assessment of the self - consistent spectrum of a grb in the presence of self - induced pair formation .",
