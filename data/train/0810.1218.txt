    "the crystal field from the host influences the transitions probabilities between the rare earth levels in a manner very dependent of the microscopic details of the quantum charge distributions .",
    "an alternative possibility , of interest here , relies on the possibility to locally enhance the excitation strength using metallic nanoparticles as local optical antennas .",
    "in addition , the decay rates of a given quantum emitter also depends on the environment , from purely electromagnetic , macroscopic considerations @xcite .",
    "metallic nanoparticles can thus be used as antennas both to enhance the incident field and to increase the emission rate .",
    "surface enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers ) serves as a clear demonstration of the potentiality of using such effects to obtain a strong signal . beyond a chemical contribution ,",
    "the strong local fields and radiative rates from plasmon resonances yield increases of many orders of magnitude .",
    "the first experimental demonstration of sers was made with an ensemble of molecules adsorbed on a rough metal surface@xcite . in the 1980s , as sers experiments mainly concerned assemblies of emitters @xcite , no quantitative agreement with the theory could be found .",
    "the main reason is that the emission depends strongly on the orientation of the molecule , its distance to the antenna , and the exact shape of the latter .",
    "recent advances on the manipulation at nanoscale enable the study of single molecule and single nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "sers is now routinely used for sample characterization , and it is exploited in apertureless scanning near field microscopy to obtain images with subwavelength resolution @xcite .",

    "a recent review on the modification of single molecule fluorescence close to a nanostructure can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . nonetheless , the signal increase is in general much weaker than for sers , due to a distinct light emission mechanism : raman is a coherent process , comparable to rayleigh scattering , but fluorescence is typically incoherent , with the population and depopulation of the different energy levels regulating photon emission .    in view of the fundamental differences between these emission mechanisms ,",
    "it is not a priori obvious what will be the effect of metallic nanoparticles on upconversion processes . in 2007 , polman _",
    "@xcite showed that upconversion luminescence from er ions could be used to image surface plasmons .",
    "the influence of small metallic nanoparticles on the upconverted signal from an assembly of er ions has recently been investigated experimentally @xcite , but no theoretical model was given .",
    "the purpose of this article is to address the issue of upconversion from a single emitter located in the near field of an individual nanoparticle .",
    "we consider two upconversion mechanisms which are often predominant in systems consisting of rare earths such as erbium or erbium - ytterbium : excited state absorption ( @xmath0 ) and non - radiative energy transfer ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "one reason for optimism in the search of large signal enhancements is the proportionality between the upconverted signal far from saturation and the square ( or a higher power)@xcite of the light intensity .",
    "this reminds of the well - known fourth power relation between the raman signal and the local electric field enhancement .",
    "thus , one could expect upconversion gains from localized plasmonic resonances as large as for sers .",
    "large enhancements are , however , far from guaranteed , as both @xmath1 and @xmath0 differ from raman in an essential property . like fluorescence",
    ", they are incoherent absorption - emission processes , which can be treated using rate equations , _ not _ a coherent scattering formalism . in other words",
    ", they involve real , not virtual , transitions .",
    "we derive simple analytical equations to study the influence of the environment on upconversion processes .",
    "we also present similar equations for raman scattering and fluorescence in order to compare the different processes .",
    "our main objective is to obtain simple equations that captures the essence of the influence of nanoantennas on these processes .",
    "thus , we use simplified level schemes and ignore some of the very complex physical phenomena that can enter in a real system . we illustrate the physical content of our model using numerical simulations of metallic particles of different size , at wavelengths where they exhibit localized surface plasmon polariton ( @xmath2 ) resonances .",
    "we also briefly consider how differences on the level scheme translate into the enhancement of the upconversion signal ( see appendix b ) .",
    "as fig .  [ energylevels](a ) illustrates , we begin by studying a very general case , how particles imbedded in an homogeneous , loss - less medium affect the light emitted by quantum emitters with discrete energy levels ",

    "not necessarily known , we consider only dipolar electric transitions and relatively simple schemes that illustrate many of the phenomena of interest .",
    "we leave to appendix b a further discussion of possible changes on the level scheme .",
    "we study the low intensity regime so that there are no saturation effects .",
    "we focus on the influence of purely electromagnetic effects that result directly from the presence of the metallic nanoparticles .",
    "we do not consider , for example , possible changes on the crystal field due to the presence of the particle .",
    "as we consider single , fixed quantum emitters , diffusion effects @xcite which are often important for rare earths systems do not play a role .",
    "non - local effects on the dielectric constant can in principle increase the non - radiative decay rate and thus diminish the emitted power .",
    "they are predominant at short distances to the substrate @xcite , but they will be significantly less important at the conditions of maximum upconversion enhancement shown in the following and we have not considered them .",

    ", it will be necessary to match the particles resonances , the excitation frequency and the energy levels . to facilitate comparison over a broad range of excitation frequency @xmath3 , the energy difference between the ground and first excited state is always matched to the incident light , and other energy differences scale directly with this value .",
    "the excitation is assumed broad enough for population equations to be applicable and for frequency shifts @xcite due to the environment to be negligible , but sufficiently narrow to excite only the desired transition .",
    "the magnitude of interest is the ratio between the light power emitted in all directions at the desired frequency @xmath4 with and without the particles @xmath5 .",
    "we introduce in this section the equations describing the effect of the particule on the emitted power @xmath5 , for upconversion , both for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as also for the known cases of fluorescence and raman emission .",

    "raman is a coherent process in which incident and scattered photons differ by a small energy amount that can be transferred , e.g. to a vibrational level of a molecule .",
    "the scattering enhancement is partly due to the enhancement of the local intensity at the scatterer position and partly due to the enhancement of the radiation emission due to the presence of the nanoantenna ( appendix a ) .",
    "the former is characterized by the enhancement @xmath6 of the projection of the field into the dipole .",

    "the equality holds , for example , in the particular case of a confocal set - up .",
    "if the excitation and emission frequency are sufficiently close , we finally find    @xmath13    the often discussed proportionality between the intensity of the emitted light and the fourth power of the field enhancement follows from such frequently encountered conditions .",

    "+      fluorescence is very different from the scattering case as the former involves a real transition , and can thus be described by population equations .",

    "finally , the comparison of the fluorescence signal with and without nanoparticle in the low intensity illumination regime under constant illumination yields the known equation @xcite    @xmath31    which only depends on the near - field enhancement and the ratio between the quantum yields with and without particles .",
    "a key difference with scattering is that for each excitation of the quantum emitter to @xmath27 a maximum of one photon contribute to the fluorescence . only after the quantum emitter has decayed a new excitation and subsequent photon emission",
    "can occur , and the number of the excited molecules is always lower than the total number of quantum emitters .",

    "we have also assumed identical field enhancement for @xmath41 and @xmath43 and an effective decay rate @xmath45 for the complete system that is affected by the particle in the same way as for an individual quantum emitter .",
    "if there is no intrinsic losses , @xmath43 decays directly from @xmath35 to @xmath29 and @xmath46 the presence of the particles can _ not _ increase the emission of upconverted photons .",
    "we observe that the obtained expressions for the two upconverted processes are proportional to the fourth power of the near - field enhancement , similarly to the usual expression for raman signal .",
    "however , the fourth power arises in upconversion because it is a two - photon process , while in raman it emerges from a similar contribution from the near - field enhancement and the emission efficiency of the dipole in eq .",

    "we discuss the possibility of larger signal enhancements for more complex systems ( see appendix b ) .",
    "using more complex resonant geometries can also be useful to obtain strong upconversion signal .",

    "in this section , we derive the form of the enhancement of the scattered field produced by a nanoantenna .",
    "let us consider a system where the excitation and the detection are produced by a source located at point @xmath105 .",
    "we characterize the source by an electric dipole moment @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a unit vector that describes the polarization of the source .",
    "the electric field produced at @xmath108 reads : @xmath109 where @xmath110 denotes the green s tensor of the system at the excitation frequency @xmath3 .",
    "this is simply the most general linear relation between two vectors .",
    "if the emitter is in a vacuum , then the green s tensor is the vacuum green s tensor @xmath111 . if the system includes a confocal microscope or any linear optical system , the green s tensor accounts for it",
    "thus , although we have introduced a dipole source , a variety of illumination conditions is included formally . in the presence of a nanoantenna",
    ", the green s tensor can be cast in the form : @xmath112\\mathbf{p}_1,\\ ] ] where @xmath113 accounts for the contribution of the nanoantenna to the green s tensor . if we compare the field along @xmath114 at @xmath108 with and without the nanoantenna , we find an enhancement @xmath115 given by :    @xmath116    the field induces a dipole moment along @xmath114 given by @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the polarizability .",
    "it is either at the same frequency for rayleigh scattering or at a slightly different frequency for raman scattering @xmath4 .",
    "the field produced by the induced dipole at a point @xmath119 is given by    @xmath120    we now consider two cases .",
    "the case where we have a confocal detection system and the case where we are interested in the emission over a given solid angle .",
    "let us first assume that we use a confocal detection system with both illumination and detection at the same point @xmath121 .",
    "we further assume that before detection light passes through a polarizer parallel to the unit vector @xmath107 .",
    "the signal is then proportional to    @xmath122    we now use the reciprocity theorem that implies that @xmath123 .",
    "it follows that @xmath124 .",
    "if we now compare the signal @xmath125 obtained in presence of the nanoantenna with the signal @xmath126 without nanoantenna , we get : @xmath127 in other words , the enhancement of the emission is equivalent to the enhancement of the illumination . when the scattering process is elastic so that @xmath128 , we obtain an enhancement given by @xmath129 the equation also holds for raman if the difference between emission and excitation frequency is sufficiently small .",
    "the exponent 4 shows that the signal varies like the fourth power of the enhancement produced by the presence of the antenna .",
    "the derivation shows that the fourth power enhancement is due to the role of the antenna that enhances both the illumination and the emission .",
    "note that we have assumed that the detection is made at the same point and for the same polarization than the illumination .",
    "a different configuration might not yield this fourth power of the enhancement .",
    "in particular , we now consider that the detection system integrates over a solid angle @xmath130 .",
    "we denote @xmath131 the emission rate of a dipole in the presence of the nanoantenna and @xmath132 the emission rate without the nanoantenna .",
    "the emission rate refers here to the photons emitted through a surface subtending a solid angle @xmath130 .",
    "the enhancement of the raman process is then given by @xmath133 we have simply written here that the amplitude of the induced dipole is enhanced by a factor @xmath134 and that its emission in a given solid angle is enhanced by a factor @xmath131 . if we are interested in the emission over all directions , we simply use the corresponding radiative rate denoted by @xmath135 , which is the case in the text .",
    "note that in the case that the emission pattern is not far from isotropic and is predominantly polarized as the excitation we have due to reciprocity @xmath136 , a relationship that we have used in the text to obtain simplified equations ; for @xmath137 , the fourth power @xmath138 is also under such conditions a good approximation for emission over all directions .",
    "we present here the known derivation of the fluorescence equation@xcite to get familiar with the procedure followed for the upconversion expressions . as it involves a real transition ,",
    "the derivation used for the raman case is not valid . for weak illumination ,",
    "the power emitted at the fluorescence frequency is due to spontaneous emission and is proportional to @xmath139 , the population of the excited state .",

    "the physics is clear : in the low intensity regime , the absorption increases linearly with the enhancement of the intensity @xmath157 so that the population of the excited state increases also linearly .",

    "when writing that the emitted power is proportional to @xmath158 , we find that the power is proportional to the quantum yield @xmath159 .",
