    "in supersymmetric ( susy ) hybrid inflation models , inflation is associated with the breaking of a gauge symmetry @xmath2 to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the symmetry breaking scale @xmath3 is fixed by the amplitude of the primordial curvature perturbation , and turns out to be of order @xmath4 gev , remarkably close , if not identical , to the supersymmetric grand unification scale @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple and compelling example of @xmath2 is provided by the standard model gauge group supplemented by a gauged @xmath5 symmetry which requires , from anomaly cancellations , the presence of three right handed neutrinos .",
    "other , more elaborate examples of @xmath2 in which susy hybrid inflation @xcite and its extensions , namely shifted hybrid inflation @xcite and smooth hybrid inflation @xcite , have been implemented include so(10 ) @xcite and its various subgroups . in the hybrid and shifted hybrid inflation models , the scalar spectral index @xmath6 , whereas in the smooth case , @xmath7 . furthermore , @xmath8 , while the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath9 turns out to be of order @xmath10 or less @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to estimate the reheat temperature that is required to generate sufficient lepton asymmetry following hybrid , shifted or smooth hybrid inflation . although reheating and leptogenesis in these models has previously been addressed @xcite , the soft susy breaking terms and their impact on inflation were not adequately included .",
    "it turns out that the new terms are significant for estimating the minimum reheat temperature in these models .",
    "we also present revised estimates for the symmetry breaking scale associated with inflation as well as the scalar spectral index .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ chap2 ]",
    "we provide a brief review of susy hybrid inflation and its extensions .",
    "we compute the allowed range of the dimensionless coupling in the superpotential and the dependence of the spectral index on this coupling , in the presence of canonical sugra corrections and soft susy violating terms . in section [ chap3 ]",
    "we investigate reheating and the generation of matter following inflation in these models . for hierarchical right",
    "handed neutrinos , we obtain a lower bound on the reheat temperature from the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "we also briefly comment on the resolution of the mssm @xmath11 problem and its impact on the reheat temperature .",
    "the susy hybrid inflation model @xcite is realized by the renormalizable superpotential @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 denote a conjugate pair of superfields transforming as nontrivial representations of some gauge group @xmath2 , @xmath14 is a gauge singlet superfield , and @xmath15 @xmath16 is a dimensionless coupling . a suitable @xmath17 r - symmetry , under which @xmath18 and @xmath14 transform the same way , ensures the uniqueness of this superpotential at the renormalizable level @xcite . in the absence of supersymmetry",
    "breaking , the potential energy minimum corresponds to non - zero ( and equal in magnitude ) vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath19 for the scalar components in @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while the vev of @xmath14 is zero .",
    "( we use the same notation for superfields and their scalar components . )",
    "thus , @xmath2 is broken to some subgroup @xmath22 which , in many interesting models , coincides with the mssm gauge group .    in order to realize inflation , the scalar fields",

    "thus broken , there are radiative corrections from the @xmath25 supermultiplets that provide logarithmic corrections to the potential , with additional contributions to the inflationary potential arising from @xmath26 supergravity .    with a minimal kahler potential one contribution to the inflationary potential",

    "the more important soft term , ignored as far as we can tell in all earlier calculations , is @xmath31 . for convenience ,",
    "we write this as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "the effective potential is approximately given by the radiative corrections @xcite plus the leading sugra correction @xmath34 and this soft term : @xmath35 + a\\,m_{3/2 } \\kappa m^2|s|\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the dimensionality of the @xmath20 , @xmath21 representations , and @xmath38 is a renormalization mass scale .",
    "we perform our numerical calculations using this potential , taking @xmath39=1 tev , and using the well known equations in the slow roll approximation : the number of e - folds after the comoving scale @xmath40 has crossed the horizon is given by @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the normalized real scalar field , @xmath43 is the value of the field at the comoving scale @xmath40 and @xmath44 is the value of the field at the end of inflation .",
    "the amplitude of the curvature perturbation @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 which we evaluate for the comoving wavenumber @xmath47 mpc@xmath48 .",

    ", there are two separate solutions of @xmath3 for a given @xmath15 .    for @xmath65 , there are again two solutions , but for the solution with a lower value of @xmath3 , the slope changes sign as the inflaton rolls for @xmath60 and the inflaton gets trapped in a false vacuum .",
    "the second solution in principle allows @xmath66 , but this is not very natural since it requires a delicate cancellation between two large terms in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ spert ] ) .",
    "there is also a soft mass term @xmath67 in the potential , corresponding to an additional term @xmath68 in the denominator of eq .",

    "the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath15 as well as the allowed range of @xmath15 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:21 ] .",
    "note that the soft term depends on @xmath70 , so it should be checked whether @xmath70 changes significantly during inflation .",
    "numerically , we find that it does not , except for a range of @xmath15 around @xmath10 . for this range ,",
    "corresponding to the grey segments in the figure , if the initial value of the @xmath14 field is greater than @xmath3 by at least a factor of two or so , the soft term and the slope become negative even if they were initially positive , before inflation can suitably end ( fig .",
    "[ farg ] ) .",

    "the rate of change in @xmath70 is @xmath75 .",
    "therefore one expects that @xmath70 would change significantly if @xmath76 . for the range of @xmath15 where the radiative term dominates , @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath60 , the soft term dominates the slope of the potential , and eq .",
    "( [ spert ] ) then has solutions with higher values of the slope , and the duration of inflation is shorter .",
    "consequently , @xmath70 stays fixed also in the left segments of the curves .",

    "[ fig:22 ] .",
    "the segment with @xmath79 for small @xmath15 corresponds to the solution with a high symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the running of the spectral index is negligible , with @xmath80 .",
    "the experimental data disfavor @xmath78 values in excess of unity on smaller scales ( say @xmath81 mpc@xmath48 ) , which leads us to restrict ourselves to @xmath82 for @xmath83 . may be allowed in models where dissipative effects are significant .",
    "such effects become important for large values of @xmath15 , provided the inflaton also has strong couplings to matter fields @xcite . ]",
    "thus , the vacuum energy density during inflation is considerably smaller than the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "indeed , the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath84 .",
    "the inflationary scenario based on the superpotential @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ super ] ) has the characteristic feature that the end of inflation essentially coincides with the gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , modifications should be made to @xmath18 if the breaking of @xmath2 to @xmath22 leads to the appearance of topological defects such as monopoles , strings or domain walls . as shown in @xcite , one simple resolution of the topological defects problem",
    "is achieved by supplementing @xmath18 with a non - renormalizable term : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is comparable to the susy grand unified theory ( gut ) scale @xmath87 gev and @xmath88 is an effective cutoff scale .",
    "the dimensionless coefficient of the non - renormalizable term is absorbed in @xmath89 .",
    "the presence of the non - renormalizable term enables an inflationary trajectory along which the gauge symmetry is broken .",

    "the resulting scalar potential possesses two ( symmetric ) valleys of local minima which are suitable for inflation and along which the gut symmetry is broken . as in the case of shifted hybrid inflation , potential problems associated with topological defects are avoided .    the vev @xmath3 at the susy minimum is given by @xmath105 .",
