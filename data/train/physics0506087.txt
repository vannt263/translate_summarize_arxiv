    "the bioeffects of non - ionizing ultra - wideband ( uwb ) electromagnetic ( em ) pulses of nanosecond duration , or nanopulses , have not been studied in as much detail as the effects of continuous - wave ( cw ) radiation .",
    "research on the effects of high intensity em nanopulses is only a recent development in biophysics ( hu _ et al _ 2005 , schoenbach _ et al _ 2004 ) . while it has been observed that nanopulses are very damaging to electronics , their effects on biological material are not very clear ( miller _ et al _ 2002 ) .",
    "a typical nanopulse has a width of few nanoseconds , a rise time on the order of 100 picoseconds , an amplitude of up to several hundreds kilovolts , and a very large frequency bandwidth .",
    "uwb pulses , when applied in radar systems , have a potential for better spatial resolution , larger material penetration , and easier target information recovery ( taylor 1995 ) .",
    "they were approved in 2002 by the federal communications commission in the u.s . for  applications such as radar imaging of objects buried under the ground or behind walls and short - range , high - speed data transmissions \" ( fcc 2002 ) .",
    "it is , therefore , very important to understand their interaction with biological materials .",
    "experiments which can provide a basis for nanopulse exposure safety standards consist of exposing biological systems to uwb radiation .",
    "the basic exposure equipment consists of a pulse generator , an exposure chamber , such as a gigahertz transverse electromagnetic mode cell ( gtem ) , and measuring instruments ( miller _ et al _ 2002 ) .",
    "a typical nanopulse is fed into the gtem cell and propagates virtually unperturbed to the position of the sample . while the pulse generator output can be easily measured ,",
    "the electric field in an exposure chamber in the vicinity and inside the sample is difficult or even impossible to measure . to find the field inside the sample it is necessary to consider a computational approach consisting of numerical solution of maxwell s equations .",
    "a computational approach requires a realistic description of the geometry and the physical properties of exposed biological material , must be able to deal with a broadband response , and be numerically robust and appropriate for the computer technology of today .",
    "the numerical method based on the finite difference - time domain ( fdtd ) method satisfies these conditions .",
    "this method is originally introduced by kane yee in the 1960s ( yee 1966 ) , but was extensively developed in the 1990s ( sadiku 1992 , kunz and luebbers 1993 , sullivan 2000 , taflove and hagness 2000 ) .    in the previous paper ( simicevic and haynie 2005 )",
    ", we applied the fdtd method to calculate the em field inside biological samples exposed to nanopulses in a gtem cell .",
    "while the physical properties of the environment were included in the calculation to the fullest extent , we restricted ourselves to two - dimensional geometry in order to reduce the computational time . in this paper",
    "we report the results of a full three - dimensional calculation of the same problem .",
    "we will show that the essential features of the two - dimensional solution , such as the importance of the rise time , remain , and that full three - dimensional computation produces new results and reveals the complexity of the em fields inside the exposed sample . since it is possible that the bioeffects of short em pulses are qualitatively different from those of narrow - band radio frequencies , knowing all the field components inside the sample is essential for the development of a model of the biological cell , cellular environment , and em interaction mechanisms and their effects ( polk and postow 1995 ) .",
    "the results presented in this paper are obtained using a full three - dimensional calculation of the same fdtd computer code described in the previous work .",
    "this code was validated by comparing the numerical and analytical solution of maxwell s equations for a problem which had comparable geometrical and physical complexity to the one being studied in this work ( simicevic and haynie 2005 ) .",
    "the key requirements imposed on the code is that the space discretization of the geometry and description of the physical properties are accurate in the high frequency domain associated with an uwb pulse and appropriate for numerical simulation .",
    "the computation consists of calculating em fields inside the polystyrene cuvette , shown in figure  [ expo ] , filled with biological material and exposed to uwb radiation .",
    "the size of the cuvette is @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 , with @xmath5 thick walls . in order to compare the results from this work and the results from the previous two - dimensional calculation ,",
    "the material inside the cuvette was the same , blood or water .",
    "the cuvette was exposed to a vertically polarized em pulse the shape of which is described as a double exponential function ( samn and mathur 1999 )    @xmath6    @xmath7 is pulse amplitude and coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath9 define the pulse rise time , fall time , and width .",
    "numerical values of the parameters are roughly the ones measured in the gtem cell used for bioelectromagnetic research at louisiana tech university : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "this pulse has a rise time of @xmath13 and a width of @xmath14 . while detailed properties of a double exponential pulse can be found elsewhere ( dvorak and dudley 1995 ) , for better understanding of the results presented in this paper it is useful to know the frequency spectrum of the pulse used , which we plotted in figure  [ four ] .",
    "the shape of the cuvette and the sample inside was discretized by means of yee cells , cubes of edge length @xmath15 .",
    "the yee cells had to be small enough not to distort the shape and large enough for the time step , calculated from the courant stability criterion ( taflove and brodwin 1975 , kunz and luebbers 1993 , taflove and hagness 2000 )    @xmath16    to be practical for overall computation . in equation [ cour",
    "] , in our case , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the speed of light in vacuum . in order for the computation to be appropriate for the full frequency range of the em pulse",
    ", the size of a yee cell must also satisfy the rule    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the speed of light in the material and @xmath21 is the highest frequency considered defined by the pulse rise time @xmath22 in this equation @xmath23 is a maximum frequency in @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a rise time in @xmath26 ( faulkner 1969 ) .    in the previous , as well as in the present work",
    ", the yee cube edge length of @xmath27 satisfies all the above criteria and may be used to model blood exposure to the wave frequency of up to @xmath28 , a much greater value than required by the rise time criterion .",
    "the time step derived from the courant criterion is @xmath29 .",
    "optimal agreement between geometrical and physical descriptions eliminated the need for additional approximations and resulted in about one hour of computational time for every nanosecond of simulated time on a modern personal computer .",
    "proper description of the dielectric properties of the exposed material is crucial when dealing with an uwb electromagnetic pulse .",
    "em properties of a biological material are normally expressed in terms of frequency - dependent dielectric properties and conductivity , usually parametrized using the cole - cole model ( gabriel 1996 , gabriel _ et al _ 1996 ) :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the permittivity in the terahertz frequency range , @xmath33 are the drops in permittivity in a specified frequency range , @xmath34 are the relaxation times , @xmath35 is the ionic conductivity , and @xmath36 are the coefficients of the cole - cole model .",
    "they constitute up to 14 real parameters of a fitting procedure .",
    "while this function can be numerically fourier transformed into the time domain , its application is problematic for fdtd .",
    "in addition to the physical problems arising when the cole - cole parametrization is applied ( simicevic and haynie 2005 ) , this parametrization requires time consuming numerical integration techniques and makes computation unacceptably slow .",
    "if instead of a cole - cole parametrization one uses the debye model in which the dielectric properties of a material are described as a sum of @xmath37 independent first - order processes    @xmath38    then for each independent first - order process the fourier transformation has an analytical solution    @xmath39    @xmath40 is the electric susceptibility of a material ( jackson 1999 ) and @xmath34 is the relaxation time for process @xmath41 .",
    "the static conductivity , @xmath35 , is defined in the time domain as the constant of proportionality between the current density and the applied electric field , @xmath42 , and its implementation in fdtd does not require additional or different fourier transforms ( kunz and luebbers 1993 ) .",
    "the debye parametrization allows use of a recursive convolution scheme ( luebbers _ et al _ 1990 , 1991 , luebbers and hunsberger 1992 ) and makes fdtd computation an order of magnitude faster compared to the use of numerical integration . in a recursive convolution scheme",
    "the permittivity at time step @xmath43 is simply the permittivity at time step @xmath44 multiplied by a constant ( kunz and luebbers 1993 ) .",
    "in addition to making the computation faster , in the previous work ( simicevic and haynie 2005 ) we have shown that the debye model also provides a sufficiently accurate description of physical properties of some biological materials .",
    "here we use the same debye parameters used in the previous two - dimensional calculation .",
    "the parameters applied in the debye model of the form    @xmath45    are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".debye parameters for the materials used in the computation ( simicevic and haynie 2005 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , figure [ ehxyz ] shows a few values of all the electric and magnetic field components in the blood and in the cuvette walls in the x - z plane during the pulse rise time .",
    "the curves are separated in time by 20 @xmath46 .",
    "as expected , the @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are continuous and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are discontinuous at the boundaries of the materials .",
    "the buildup of a resonant steady wave is also shown .    the full three - dimensional computation of the exposure of the blood - filled cuvette to a linearly - polarized em pulse described by equation  [ dubexp ] , not only reproduced the results of the two - dimensional computation , but also gave an insight into properties of induced components of the em field . the three - dimensional calculation supports the notion that pulse penetration is a function of both rise time and pulse width , with both pulse features important in the case of a non - conductive material , right side of figure [ dubexp ] , and the penetration dominated by rise time in the case of a conductive material , left side of figure [ dubexp ] .",
    "it also shows that for a material of considerable conductivity , the incident pulse width is relatively unimportant .",
    "in addition , the three - dimensional calculation reveals that the dielectric box exposed to em pulses behaves as a dielectric resonator .",
    "fdtd approach also allows calculation of the energy deposited in a biological material using ( jackson 1999 )    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the total energy per unit time absorbed in the volume , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are , respectively , the current density and electric field inside the material , and @xmath35 is the conductivity of the material .",
    "fdtd computation provides all the above values through the entire time and it is easy to perform numerical integration of equation [ power ] .",
    "the results from the three - dimensional calculation are the same as from the two - dimensional calculation . for blood ,",
    "the average converted energy per pulse , described by equation  [ dubexp ] , is again @xmath57 .",
    "the resulting temperature increase of @xmath58 per pulse is clearly negligible if the pulse repetition rate is low .",
    "experiments performed by p. t. vernier _ et al _ ( vernier _ et al _ 2004 ) have shown that even the nanopulses of similar duration but orders of magnitude higher field amplitude than the ones used in this work do not not cause significant intra- or extra - cellular joule heating in the case of a low pulse repetition rate .",
    "in this paper we have extended our previous fdtd calculations on nanopulse penetration into biological matter from two to three dimensions .",
    "calculations included the same detailed geometrical description of the material exposed to nanopulses , the same accurate description of the physical properties of the material , the same spatial resolution of @xmath59 side length of the yee cell , and the same cut - off frequency of @xmath60 in vacuum and @xmath61 in the dielectric .",
    "to minimize computation time , the dielectric properties of a tissue in the frequency range @xmath62 were formulated in terms of the debye parametrization which we have shown in a previous paper to be , for the materials studied , as accurate as the cole - cole parametrization .",
    "the results of three - dimensional fdtd calculation can be summarized as follows :    \\a ) the shape of a nanopulse inside a biomaterial is a function of both rise time and width of the incident pulse , with the importance of the rise time increasing as the conductivity of the material increases .",
    "biological cells inside a conductive material are exposed to pulses which are often substantially shorter than the duration of the incident pulse .",
    "the same results followed from the two - dimensional calculation .",
    "\\b ) the dielectric material exposed to the em pulse shows a behavior which can be attributed to the properties of a dielectric resonator .",
    "this result could not have been obtained by the two - dimensional calculation .",
    "\\c ) the amount of energy deposited by the pulse is small and no effect observed from exposure of a biological sample to nanopulses can have a thermal origin .",
    "calculation of the electric field surrounding a biological cell is a necessary step in understanding effects resulting from exposure to nanopulses .",
    "we have developed a complete fdtd code capable of this . in the near future , through the louisiana optical network initiative , we will have access to several supercomputers at louisiana universities connected into one virtual statewide supercomputer .",
    "we will soon be able to calculate very complicated structures , larger size objects , and more complex materials .",
