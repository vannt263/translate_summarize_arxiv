    "complex systems often exhibit a dynamics on two time scales : a fast one as represented by a given stochastic process and a slow one for the parameters of that process . as a very simple example consider the following linear langevin equation @xmath0 with parameters @xmath1 that fluctuate on a long time scale @xcite .",
    "it describes the velocity @xmath2 of a brownian particle that moves through spatial ` cells ' with different local inverse temperature @xmath3 in each cell ( a nonequilibrium situation ) .",
    "assume , for example , that the probability distribution of @xmath4 in the various cells is a @xmath5-distribution of degree @xmath6 , @xmath7 then the conditional probability is @xmath8 , the joint probability is @xmath9 , and the marginal probability is @xmath10 .",
    "integration yields @xmath11 i.e.  we obtain power - law stationary distributions just as in tsallis statistics @xcite with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the average of @xmath4 .",
    "all this has a very broad interpretion and can be generalized in various ways@xmath4 need not to be inverse temperature .",
    "one can generalize the above example to general probability densities @xmath15 and general hamiltonians in statistical mechanics .",
    "one then has a superposition of two different statistics : that of @xmath4 and that of ordinary statistical mechanics .",
    "the short name for this is _ superstatistics _ @xcite .",
    "superstatistics describes complex _ nonequilibrium systems _ with _ spatio - temporal fluctuations of an intensive parameter _",
    "( e.g.  inverse temperature ) on a large scale .",
    "define an effective boltzmann factor @xmath16 by @xmath17 where @xmath15 is the probability distribution of @xmath4 and @xmath18 the energy of the system .",
    "many results can be proved for _",
    "general @xmath15_. here we list some recent theoretical developments of the superstatistics concept :    * can prove superstatistical generalizations of fluctuation theorems @xcite * can develop a variational principle for the large - energy asymptotics of general superstatistics @xcite ( depending on @xmath15 , one can get not only power laws for large @xmath18 but e.g. also stretched exponentials ) * can formally define generalized entropies for general superstatistics @xcite * can study various theoretical extensions and workouts of the superstatistics concept @xcite * can prove a superstatistical version of a central limit theorem leading to tsallis statistics @xcite * can relate it to fractional reaction equations @xcite * can consider superstatistical random matrix theory @xcite * can apply superstatistical techniques to networks @xcite and time series @xcite    ... and some more practical applications :    * can apply superstatistical methods to analyse the statistics of 3d hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite * can apply it to atmospheric turbulence ( wind velocity fluctuations at florence airport @xcite ) and defect turbulence @xcite * can apply superstatistical methods to finance @xcite * can apply it to solar flares @xcite , and even to print queues @xcite * can apply it to cosmic ray statistics @xcite * can apply it to various scattering processes in particle physics @xcite * can apply it to hydroclimatic fluctuations @xcite * can apply it to british train delay statistics @xcite",
    "basically , there are _ 3 physically relevant universality classes _ @xcite :    * \\(a ) @xmath5-superstatistics ( @xmath19 tsallis statistics ) * \\(b ) inverse @xmath5-superstatistics * \\(c ) lognormal superstatistics    why ?",
    "consider , e.g. , case ( a ) .",
    "assume there are many microscopic random variables @xmath20 , @xmath21 , contributing to @xmath4 in an additive way .",
    "for large @xmath22 , their sum @xmath23 will approach a gaussian random variable @xmath24 due to the ( ordinary ) central limit theorem .",
    "there can be @xmath6 gaussian random variables @xmath25 due to various relevant degrees of freedom in the complex system . since @xmath4 is positive we may square the @xmath26 to obtain something positive . the sum @xmath27 is then @xmath5-distributed with degree @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the average of @xmath4 .",
    "integration as described in section 1 yields tsallis statistics as a special case of superstatistics .",
    "\\(b ) the same considerations can be applied if the ` temperature ' @xmath30 rather than @xmath4 itself is the sum of several squared gaussian random variables arising out of many microscopic degrees of freedom @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting @xmath15 is the inverse @xmath5-distribution : @xmath31 it generates superstatistical distributions @xmath32 that decay as @xmath33 for large @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "\\(c ) @xmath4 may be generated by multiplicative random processes .",
    "consider a local cascade random variable @xmath34 , where @xmath22 is the number of cascade steps and the @xmath20 are positive microscopic random variables . by the central limit theorem",
    ", @xmath35 becomes gaussian for large @xmath22 .",
    "hence @xmath24 is log - normally distributed . in general",
    "there may be @xmath6 such product contributions to @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath37 is a sum of gaussian random variables ; hence it is gaussian as well .",
    "thus @xmath4 is log - normally distributed , i.e. , @xmath38 lognormal superstatistics is relevant in turbulence @xcite .",
    "turbulence is a spatio - temporal chaotic state of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "energy is dissipated in a cascade - like process .",
    "bodenschatz et al .",
    "@xcite obtained rather precise measurements of the acceleration @xmath39 of a single tracer particle in a turbulent flow .",
    "one can now construct a superstatistical lagrangian model for _",
    "3-dimensional _ velocity differences @xmath40 of such a tracer particle ( note that @xmath41 for small @xmath42 ) .",
    "this model is given by the superstatistical stochastic differential equation @xcite @xmath43 the new thing as compared to previous work is the term involving the vector product .",
    "it describes fluctuating enstrophy ( rotational energy ) around the test particle . while @xmath44 and @xmath45 are constants , the noise strength @xmath46 and the unit vector @xmath47 evolve stochastically on a large time scale @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "one has @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the taylor scale reynolds number .",
    "the time scale @xmath49 describes the average life time of a region of given vorticity surrounding the test particle .",
    "define @xmath52 , then in this model @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath55 the average energy dissipation .",
    "the probability density of the stochastic process @xmath56 is assumed to be a lognormal distribution as given in eq .",
    "( [ logno ] ) .",
    "for very small @xmath42 an acceleration component of the particle is given by @xmath57 and one gets the following prediction for the stationary distribution : @xmath58 this compares very well with the experimentally measured probability distribution of acceleration , see fig .  1 .    ) , @xmath59 .,width=377 ]",
    "3-dimensional superstatistics induces correlations between the components @xmath60 of the acceleration vector @xmath61 .",
    "consider the ratio @xmath62 . for independent acceleration components this ratio would always be given by @xmath63 .",
    "however , our 3-d superstatistical model yields the prediction @xmath64 this is a very general formula , it is also valid for tsallis statistics , where @xmath15 is the @xmath5-distribution .",
    "note that @xmath63 for @xmath65 , i.e.if there are no fluctuations in @xmath4 then all components are independent random variables .",
    "2 shows @xmath66 as predicted by lognormal superstatistics .     as given by eq .",
    "( [ rrr ] ) for lognormal superstatistics.,width=377 ]    the figure strongly resembles @xmath67 as experimentally measured by bodenschatz et al .",
    "@xcite in a turbulent flow , see fig .",
    "as measured by bodenschatz et al .",
    "@xcite.,width=377 ]    besides correlations between components one can also look at temporal correlations .",
    "the superstatistical model @xcite allows for the calculation of temporal correlation functions as well .",
    "in particular , we may be interested in temporal correlation functions of single components @xmath68 of velocity differences , i.e.  @xmath69 . by averaging over the possible random vectors @xmath47",
    "one arrives at the formula @xmath70 i.e.  there is rapid ( exponential ) decay with a zero - crossing at @xmath71 .",
    "exponential decay and zero - crossings are also observed for the experimental data .",
    "the model @xcite also correctly reproduces the experimentally observed fact that the correlation function of the absolute value @xmath72 decays very slowly as compared to that of the single components .",
    "moreover , it correctly describes the fact that enstrophy lags behind dissipation @xcite .",
    "the moments of velocity differences of a single lagrangian test particle that is embedded in a turbulent flow scale differently from those measured in a fixed laboratory frame .",
    "our superstatistical model @xcite allows for the analytic evaluation of the lagrangian scaling exponents .",
    "the moments of velocity difference components @xmath68 on a time scale @xmath42 are obtained as @xmath73 assuming simple scaling laws of the form @xmath74 , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are so far arbitrary real numbers , on gets _ @xmath78 _",
    "hence the lagrangian scaling exponents are given by @xmath80 .",
    "usually one assumes @xmath81 , hence we get @xmath82 thus @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "this prediction is in good agreement with the recent measurements of bodenschatz et al .",
    "@xcite , see fig .  4 .    ) @xcite .",
    "dashed lines : some other competing models @xcite.,width=377 ]",
    "we end this paper with some more general thoughts . can we proceed from superstatistics as a merely statistical technique to a proper _ thermodynamic description _ ? there are some early attempts in this direction by tsallis and souza @xcite . here",
    "we want to follow a somewhat different approach @xcite : one starts quite generally from two random variables @xmath18 and @xmath45 ( representing energy and invere temperature ) and then considers the following effective entropy for a superstatistical system @xmath85&=&s[e|b]+s[b ] \\\\ & = & \\int d\\beta f(\\beta ) ( \\beta u(\\beta)+\\ln z(\\beta))- \\int d\\beta f ( \\beta ) \\ln f(\\beta),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the local internal energy and @xmath87 the local partition function .",
    "one can do thermodynamics with this extended entropy function .",
    "it reduces to ordinary thermodynamics for @xmath65 . for sharply peaked distributions @xmath15",
    "this is a slightly deformed thermodynamics , which can be evaluated in a perturbative way .",
    "one can also maximize this entropy with respect to appropriate constraints in @xmath4 to get e.g. a lognormal distribution for @xmath15 , or generally some other distribution @xmath15 depending on the constraints .",
    "for more details , see @xcite .",
    "* superstatistics ( a ` statistics of a statistics ' ) provides a physical reason why more general types of boltzmann factors ( e.g.  of power - law type ) are relevant for nonequilibrium systems with fluctuations of an intensive parameter .",
    "* there is evidence for three major physically relevant universality classes : @xmath5-superstatistics @xmath19 tsallis statistics , inverse @xmath5-superstatistics , and lognormal superstatistics .",
    "these arise as universal limit statistics for many different complex systems . *",
    "superstatistical techniques have been successfully applied to a variety of complex systems . * a superstatistical model of lagrangian turbulence",
    "@xcite is in excellent agreement with the experimental data for probability densities , correlations between components , decay of correlations , and lagrangian scaling exponents . *",
    "the long - term aim is to find a good thermodynamic description for general superstatistical systems .",
