    "initially , a gap - like behavior was reported as a gradual suppression of @xmath84 below @xmath78 @xcite , which has been called _ spin - gap_. neutron scattering experiments in underdoped regions also showed that spin excitations at low energies were suppressed in the normal state  @xcite .",
    "then , arpes experiments directly identified the existence of the energy gap in electronic spectra even above @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this gap , observed in arpes below @xmath78 , turned out to have the same angular dependence as the @xmath85-wave sc gap in the brillouin zone @xcite .",

    "henceforth , we denote @xmath78 determined by nmr and arpes as @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",

    "[ fig : pg ] both @xmath88 and @xmath89 remain unchanged between @xmath13=1 and @xmath13=2 , as mentioned in literature @xcite .",

    "[ fig : pd](a ) and [ fig : pg ] ; detail discussions on this matter remains as a future work .",

    "the critical point @xmath3 for the afm order is determined to be @xmath3 @xmath83 0.075 in the three - layered compounds ; the value is larger than in single- and bi - layered compounds , and smaller than in four- and five - layered ones .",
    "this is because the magnetic interlayer coupling becomes stronger as the stacking number @xmath13 of cuo@xmath0 layers increases .",
    "these results indicate that the uniform coexistence of afm and sc is a universal phenomenon in an underdoped region when a magnetic interlayer coupling is strong enough to stabilize an afm ordering .",
    "we have highlighted the fact that the @xmath7 dependence of the spin - gap temperature @xmath78 is independent of @xmath13 when @xmath7 @xmath93 @xmath3 , and that the spin - gap collapses in the afm region , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
