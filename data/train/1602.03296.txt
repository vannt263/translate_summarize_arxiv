    "for many decades , single nucleon transfer reactions have been one of the tools of choice for the study of shell structure in nuclei .",
    "various combinations of light projectiles were used on stable targets to probe occupied single - particle levels and valence states , e.g. the @xmath10 neutron - adding transfer to study the valence neutron shell and the ( @xmath11he ) proton - removing transfer to study occupied proton orbitals . at facilities where radioactive ion beams are available with sufficient intensity",
    ", this approach is also now used for unstable nuclei in inverse kinematics , probing those active orbitals near the fermi surface .",
    "separation energies and orbital angular momenta and the occupation of nucleon orbitals in the nucleus of interest are extracted from the energy and angular distributions of the light ejectile and from the sum of partial cross sections , respectively . using direct reaction theory ,",
    "this is done in a model - dependent way , including the use of appropriate optical potentials in the entrance and exit channels .",
    "the magnitudes and evolution of shell gaps and the softness or stiffness of the nuclear fermi surfaces were studied on many stable ( and recently also on a few unstable ) nuclei using these techniques ( see e.g. refs  @xcite for results on the stable @xmath12ca and @xmath13ca nuclei ) .    even for closed - shell nuclei , short - range correlations  @xcite and coupling to collective degrees of freedom",
    "@xcite complicate the determination of single - particle energies and spectroscopic factors ( or their related shell occupancies and vacancies ) which are not directly observable @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "reaction models exploit _ effective _ potentials that do not capture the full microscopic complexity of the nucleus and shell - model interpretations can depend strongly on truncations of the valence space . as a result ,",
    "values of spectroscopic factors , @xmath6 , deduced experimentally are quenched compared to theoretical calculations .",
    "this quenching is typically a factor of about @xmath14 @xcite in stable and near - stable nuclei .    strictly speaking , the only _ true _ experimental observables are the energies of levels in the final nucleus and their partial feeding cross sections .",
    "however , to interpret the underlying nuclear structure it is important to infer shell evolution and occupancies from these observables . assuming collective coupling ( e.g. to giant resonances ) and short - range correlation effects are similar between neighboring nuclei , consideration of the _ differential _ evolution of single - particle energies , spectroscopic strengths and occupancies is sensible , a view supported by their successful use up to now .    with the development of accelerator facilities producing intense high - energy secondary beams of rare isotopes at energies of around 100 mev / u or more ,",
    "the linear and angular momentum matching of light - ion - induced pick - up or stripping reactions is poor , resulting in small cross sections of the order of 1  mb . with thin targets ,",
    "this technique is then only applicable for the most intense beams .",
    "a higher - luminosity alternative , the intermediate - energy nucleon knockout reaction , is also being exploited successfully to study the spectroscopy of extremely neutron - rich or deficient nuclei .",
    "being sensitive to the same single- nucleon overlaps , empirical proton and neutron spectroscopic factors @xmath15 to bound states @xmath16 in the residual , mass @xmath17 , nucleus can be deduced from partial cross - section measurements  @xcite . for near - stable nuclei with modest proton to neutron separation energy asymmetry , i.e. @xmath18 mev , fast proton knockout , ( @xmath11he ) and electron - induced proton knockout @xmath19 reactions",

    "was observed when systems with extreme @xmath21 values were explored @xcite .",
    "so far , this strong trend has not been reported when using @xmath22 or ( @xmath11he ) reactions in the few systems studied with significant @xmath21 asymmetry @xcite , potentially the result of large uncertainties in the transfer reaction theory @xcite for such highly - mismatched transitions .",
    "an aim of the present work is to compare the states populated , their deduced angular momenta and their @xmath6 values as extracted from the one - proton knockout reaction @xmath1s@xmath7@xmath0p with those from the @xmath1s(@xmath11he)@xmath0p stripping reaction @xcite .",
    "this study covers proton separation energies that differ by 10  mev , from the removal of the most deeply - bound proton from the @xmath23 orbital to removal of a @xmath24 valence proton from @xmath1s .",
    "this work shows that the one - proton knockout and ( @xmath11he ) transfer reactions can be analyzed to extract consistent spectroscopic information .",
    "furthermore , a few percent of the observed cross section leads to suspected negative parity states that can not be interpreted as due to the direct one - proton knockout reaction .",

    "when assuming that the knockout and pickup reactions have a similar dependence on impact parameter , the cross section for a ts process can be derived from the product of the two individual interaction probabilities .",
    "a knockout cross section of about 50 mb was derived from our experiment , while a neutron pickup cross section of about 2.5 mb was measured at similar beam energy for the @xmath4-shell nucleus @xmath108 mg  @xcite .",
    "it follows that the ts mechanism would have a rather low cross section , of the order of 0.10 mb , that is a factor of 20 lower than we observe for the sum over all states with shifted momentum distributions .",
    "it is therefore likely that a more direct process is needed to account for the measured cross section .",
    "charge - exchange reactions occur more favorably with an allowed gt operator ( @xmath109=0 , @xmath110=@xmath1111 , @xmath112=no ) that would lead to the production of 1@xmath78 states in @xmath1p starting from the 0@xmath78 ground state of @xmath1s .",
    "higher momentum transfers are also observed when very strict kinematic condition for the reaction as well as suitable target excitations can not be selected , as in the present experiment . moreover , having a closed neutron @xmath4 shell , the exchange of an @xmath4 proton to an @xmath4 neutron orbital that would lead to 1@xmath78 states in @xmath1s is strongly hindered by pauli blocking .",
    "rather , transfer to the @xmath113 or to the highest @xmath114 orbits must become largely competitive .",
    "the non - feeding of any of the known 1@xmath78 states in @xmath1p but the population of the negative parity states 4@xmath45 ( g.s . ) , 3@xmath45 ( 250  kev ) and of the tentatively assigned 2@xmath45 ( 425 kev ) through low - energy charge - exchange reactions of ref .",
    "@xcite are in line with the above assumptions . in the present experiment ,",
    "several @xmath2 rays are observed in coincidence with @xmath1p ( see fig .",
    "[ 36p ] ) .",
    "however , none of them arise from the deexcitation of the 1@xmath78 states at 1303  kev and 2281  kev that were populated in the @xmath42 decay of @xmath1si to @xmath1p @xcite and whose decay occurs through @xmath2 rays of 878  kev and ( 934 , 977 , 1858  kev ) , respectively , as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "even if the present statistics does not allow extracting @xmath2-@xmath2 coincidences , the observation of transitions at 250  kev and about 170  kev suggest the feeding of the 3@xmath45 and 2@xmath45 states , respectively .",
    "other transitions are observed , but none ( except perhaps the 2020(20 )  kev from @xcite ) were reported in previous works .",
    "interestingly , one transition is seen at 4050  kev , i.e. about 600  kev above the neutron emission threshold of 3.465  mev .",
    "this state seems to decay preferentially through a @xmath2-ray transition rather than neutron decay to the 1/2@xmath78 ground state of @xmath0p .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the last hypothesis is that these momentum - shifted distributions result from the proton knockout from a state excited in inelastic scattering .",
    "such a ts reaction was discussed as one possibility to account for the observation of a @xmath2-decaying neutron - unbound state in @xmath0si at 3.611  mev ( @xmath58=2.470(40 )  mev ) populated in the @xmath1si @xmath115 reaction  @xcite . as shown in fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the momentum distribution associated with the production of this unbound state appears to lie dominantly in the low - momentum tail of the @xmath0si distribution , possibly indicating that its centroid is shifted to lower momentum .",
    "the production of such a state was evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite to be of 0.8(2 ) mb , a value that is comparable to the partial cross sections for the states which are observed with a shifted momentum distribution in our work . a total cross section of 2.4(4 ) mb is indeed obtained by summing over the four states represented in red in fig .",
    "[ 35p - ls ] .",
    "contrary to the case presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the states here possibly produced by the same ts mechanism are below the neutron separation energy .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the neutron emission threshold of @xmath0p ( @xmath58=8.380 mev ) is much higher than the one of @xmath0si ( @xmath58=2.470 mev ) .",
    "the spectroscopy of @xmath0p was investigated with an intermediate - energy one - proton knockout reaction using a secondary beam of @xmath1s interacting with a @xmath116be foil at 88 mev / u mid - target energy .",
    "the @xmath0p nuclei were selected by the s800 spectrograph at nscl and identified in the spectrograph s focal plane in coincidence with prompt @xmath2 rays detected in the gretina segmented ge array around the target .",
    "the level scheme of @xmath0p has been established up to about 7.5 mev from @xmath2-@xmath2 coincidences and relative @xmath2 intensities .",
    "spins and parities for most of the populated states were proposed from a comparison between calculated and measured @xmath2-gated momentum distributions for the population of individual final states in @xmath0p .",
    "spectroscopic factor values , @xmath6 , were derived from partial cross sections for the 1/2@xmath78 ground state and the excited states ( 3/2@xmath78 , 5/2@xmath78 and tentatively 1/2@xmath45 ) in @xmath0p .",
    "an inclusive cross section of 51(1 ) mb was measured for produced from .",
    "the extracted summed @xmath117 values agree with expected shell - model occupancies of the protons in the @xmath39 ( @xmath118=2.2(7 ) ) , @xmath24 ( 0.7(3 ) ) , @xmath40 ( 5.2(9 ) ) orbitals , while only a fraction ( 0.41(17 ) ) of the strength corresponding to the deeply - bound @xmath23 orbit is tentatively observed for two states above 5.6 mev .",
    "the present results were compared to those obtained for @xmath0p using the @xmath1s(@xmath76he)@xmath0p transfer reaction at low energy .",
    "remarkable agreement is found for the proposed level scheme populated , the spin assignments ( except for one state ) and the deduced @xmath6 values . since obtained from high - resolution @xmath2-ray spectroscopy , the excitation energies of the presently identified states in @xmath0p are more accurate than those obtained in the ( @xmath76he ) reaction @xcite .",
    "they agree with the values obtained in a multi - nucleon transfer reaction @xcite , for which several states were observed in common .",
    "the present sensitivity of the knockout reaction , with a projectile beam of 2 @xmath3010@xmath119 pps , matches the one obtained in the @xmath77he ) reaction with a @xmath8 beam on a stable @xmath1s target .",
    "this reinforces the enormous potential of this experimental technique in extracting level schemes , orbital angular momenta , and @xmath6 values .    besides the observation of states that were expected to be produced in the knockout of protons from the @xmath120 shell , other states with likely high spin value ( @xmath121 5/2 ) and negative parity",
    "are observed as well , with a summed partial cross section of about 2.4 mb .",
    "owing to the facts that these states were not observed in the ( @xmath11he ) reaction and that they exhibit parallel - momentum distributions that are down - shifted as compared to the ones from knockout , we propose that they are produced by another mechanism that could be either a charge - exchange or a two - steps mechanism in which a core excitation is followed by a proton knockout .",
    "while so far we can not clearly identify which of these two mechanisms is the most probable , it interestingly leads to the production of states most likely corresponding to neutron - core excitations",
