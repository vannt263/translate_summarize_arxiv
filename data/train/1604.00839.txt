    "the interaction between a fractional instanton and a fractional anti - instanton is attractive ( repulsive ) depending on the value of the relative phase modulus @xmath232 . from this strong dependence of two - body forces",
    ", we found three essential properties of non - bps exact solutions : ( i ) the appropriate relative sign in two terms of the same component , ( ii ) the reflection symmetry around the middle compressed double fractional instanton , and ( iii ) the transition between two seemingly different configurations called flipping partners as moduli parameters vary .",
    "thirdly , we have found a generic pattern of flipping partners that arises in the non - bps exact solutions , and conjecture a diagrammatic procedure to find possible configurations in various other exact solutions .",
    "fourthly , we have analyzed the local and global instabilities of the non - bps exact solution in terms of the ansatz , and found the physical meaning of deformations that give negative modes and flow to other configurations of possible global saddle points .",
    "we have discussed the simple cases of non - bps solutions in grassmann sigma models based on din - zakrzewski projection method .",
    "the detailed study of properties of solutions will be a subject of future works .",
    "the @xmath394 yang - mills theory coupled with @xmath12 higgs fields in the fundamental representation admits a non - abelian vortex solution , around which @xmath0 zero modes are localized @xcite .",
    "bps lump or instantons in the @xmath0 model on the vortex represent yang - mills instantons in the bulk point of view @xcite .",

    "<S> we find that the transition between seemingly distinct configurations of multi - instantons occur as moduli changes in the non - bps solutions , and the simplest non - bps exact solution corresponds to multi - bion configurations with fully - compressed double fractional instantons in the middle . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that the non - bps solutions make small but nonzero contribution to the resurgent trans - series as special cases of the multi - bion configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a generic pattern of transitions between distinct multi - bion configurations ( flipping partners ) , leading to the three essential properties of the non - bps exact solution : ( i ) opposite sign for terms corresponding to the left and right infinities , ( ii ) symmetric location of fractional instantons , and ( iii ) the transition between distinct bion configurations . by studying the balance of forces , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the relative phases between the instanton constituents play decisive roles in stability and instability of the muli - instanton configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss local and global instabilities of the solutions such as negative modes and the flow to the other saddle points , by considering the deformations of the non - bps exact solutions within our multi - instanton ansatz . </S>",
