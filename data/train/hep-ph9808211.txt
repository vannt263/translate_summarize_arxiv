    "this is due to the fact that the scale of the loop integrals for the diagrams in fig.1 is set by the @xmath5-boson mass , @xmath13 , rather than the electron mass .",
    "as a consequence , for center of mass energies @xmath14 between 1 kev and 1 mev , the cross sections for @xmath15 processes such as @xmath16 are larger than the @xmath0 cross sections @xcite .",
    "although of little practical importance in stellar processes where the energy scale is @xmath171 mev , the @xmath0 processes could be important in very high energy reactions such as @xmath7 @xcite , particularly if the @xmath4 behavior persists for @xmath18 .",
