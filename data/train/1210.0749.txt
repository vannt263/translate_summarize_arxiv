    "multiwavelength observations of different astrophysical objects indicate the presence of  jets \" ( marscher 2005 ) driven probably by a compact object like a black hole ( bh ) or , in some cases , a highly magnetized rotating neutron star .",
    "jets are observed at scales ranging from sub - parsec up to hundreds of kiloparsec .",
    "gamma - ray bursts are an example of small scale jets , since they are supposed to be the consequence of shocks occurring in highly collimated relativistic flows ( mszros et al .",
    "1999 ; frail et al . 2001 ; rossi et al . 2002 ) originated either at the death of a massive star or when a neutron star merges with another neutron star or with a black hole .",
    "large scale jets are observed in association with radio - galaxies , quasars , blazars or agns ( active galactic nuclei ) in general and their origin is probably the consequence of the twisting of magnetic fields anchored in the very inner region of an accreting disk around a supermassive black hole ( blandford & levinson 1995 ; meier et al .",
    "2000 ; camenzind 2005 ) .",
    "jets associated with agns have a complex structure with bulk motions characterized by lorentz factors typically in the range 10 - 50 and total power ranging from @xmath3 up to @xmath4 ergs@xmath5 .",
    "the composition of these flows is still uncertain but , in general , supposed to be constituted by electrons and protons or / and electron - positron pairs or even heavy nuclei .",
    "the composition of the jet is certainly related to the physical processes that create and energize the flow , representing an important key for the understanding of the launching mechanism . the large scale acceleration required to explain the high velocities of the bulk motion",
    "can not be purely hydrodynamic and are probably a manifestation of the presence of extended magnetic pressure gradients ( vlahakis & konigl 2004 ) .",
    "fully relativistic simulations of accretion disks around a rotating black hole indicate that unbound flows can emerge self - consistently from the accretion flow ( de villiers et al .",
    "according to these simulations , the flow has two main components : a hot , fast and tenuous outflow along the jet axis and a cold , slow and dense flow along the funnel wall defining the jet geometry ( see also meliani & keppens 2009 ) . for slow rotating bhs ,",
    "the flow energetics is dominated by the kinetic energy and the enthalpy of matter whereas for fast rotating bh the energetics is essentially given by a poynting flux .",
    "jets dominated by kinetic energy penetrate easily in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , forming low density cavities elongated in the radial direction ( guo & mathews 2011 ) .",
    "this is not the case if the energetics of the jet is dominated by highly relativistic particles . in this case ,",
    "due to the low inertia , the jet decelerates rapidly in the icm , producing large cavities due to the lateral expansion produced by the pressure of the relativistic particles ( guo & mathews 2011 ) .",
    "the result of these simulations emphasize the importance of the presence of relativistic particles in the jet , either to characterize the dynamics of the flow or the interaction with the icm .",
    "however , the acceleration mechanism ( or mechanisms ) of these relativistic particles is not yet well understood although magnetohydrodynamic shocks and fermi - like mechanisms are often invoked as possibilities .",
    "here we examine a completely different alternative , i.e. , a purely gravitational acceleration process based on the presence of an ergosphere around a kerr bh . in our scenario , we assume that an accreting rotating bh is present in the center of an active galaxy .",
    "matter penetrating the ergosphere can undergo the penrose process ( penrose 1969 ) and , under certain conditions , the emerging particles follow geodesics asymptotically parallel to the rotation axis , acquiring very high energies . although the efficiency of the penrose process is still a matter of debate , this important question will be not examined in the present paper .",
    "the existence of unbound geodesics leaving the ergosphere along the @xmath6-axis and focusing at infinity was already demonstrated by gariel et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter gmms10 ) . in the present work",
    ", it is shown that test particles , independently of their electric charge , following these highly collimated geodesics , model a narrow energetic beam in precise regions of the ergosphere .",
    "the present investigation is addressed to the study of some particular solutions describing those geodesics as well as to the analysis of the initial conditions required for their existence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the constants of motion , the total particle energy @xmath0 and the carter constant @xmath1 are derived as functions of two real roots of the characteristic equation @xmath7 , where the function @xmath8 governs the timelike geodesics in the kerr s metric ; section 3 is dedicated to the study of the particular case in which a double root of the equation @xmath9 exists .",
    "it is shown that high particle energy values are possible only for two narrow ranges of values of the considered double root ; in section 4 the two remaining roots of the characteristic equation are examined as well as the consequences for the allowed values of @xmath0 and for the asymptotes of the geodetic motion ; in section 5 an analysis of these various solutions is performed , permitting to restrict to one the different possibilities and , finally , in section 6 the main conclusions are given .",
    "firstly , it should be emphasized that our model is highly idealized since interactions with the ambient medium or with magnetic fields , which affect the motion and the energy budget of particles , are not included in the present approach and will be considered in a future paper .",
    "this investigation will be focused on the study of the motion of test particles following unbound geodesics along the @xmath6-axis , under the assumption that the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) rotates steadily .",
    "assuming an axisymmetric geometry , the generalized cylindrical or weyl coordinates ( @xmath10 , @xmath6 , @xmath11 ) , related to boyer - lindquist generalized spherical coordinates ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath11 ) by @xmath14^{1/2}\\sin \\theta , \\;\\;z=(r-1)\\cos \\theta \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath15are the most suitable for describing the system .",
    "as already mentioned , the existence of special unbound geodesics in this frame was recently demonstrated by gmms10 .",
    "these geodesics stem from the ergosphere and when @xmath16 , they are asymptotically parallel to the @xmath6 axis and positioned at distance @xmath17 that depends on @xmath18 and on two constants of motion ; the carter constant @xmath1 and the energy @xmath0 , while the third constant of motion , the @xmath6 component of the angular momentum @xmath19 is necessarily null .",
    "the function @xmath20 ( see , for instance , chandrasekhar 1983 ) introduced in the expression of the kerr timelike geodesics ( test particle mass @xmath21 ) plays a fundamental role in the analysis of the jet collimation when the engine at the centre of the accretion disk is supposed to be a stationary rotating smbh .",
    "this function is a fourth order polynomial , i.e. , @xmath22 where the coefficients , excepting @xmath23 , depend on the constants of motion and on the bh parameters ( chandrasekhar 1983 ) as @xmath24 without loss of generality , we have put @xmath25 and @xmath26 when considering the special 2d - geodesics given by equation ( [ 1a ] ) .",
    "hence , the spin @xmath27 of the smbh being fixed ( @xmath28 ) , we have two independent parameters left , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , or , equivalently from equation ( [ 1a ] ) , the position @xmath29 of the asymptote parallel to the @xmath6-axis and the energy @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider the possible roots of the equation @xmath7 of the characteristics @xmath30 of the autonomous system of geodesics equations ( chandrasekhar 1983 ) , i.e. , @xmath31 the polynomial given by equation ( [ 5 ] ) has four roots , labeled @xmath32 with @xmath33 , which can be _ a priori _ real ( positive or negative ) or complex ( contrary to the physical variable @xmath12 , which is always real and defined in the interval @xmath34 ) .",
    "the two equations @xmath35 and @xmath36 are linear in @xmath1 and @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the solution of this linear system permits to express the constants of motion as functions of the roots @xmath38 and @xmath39 , namely @xmath40+r_{1}^{2}r_{2}^{2}\\right\\ } \\label{6}\\ ] ] and @xmath41 \\right\\ } \\label{7}\\ ] ] with the denominator @xmath42 given by @xmath43+r_{1}r_{2}\\left [ ( r_{1}^{2}+r_{1}r_{2})(r_{2}-2)-2r_{2}^{2}\\right ] .",

    ", it is worth noting the symmetric role of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and that @xmath1 and @xmath45 have the same denominator @xmath42 .",
    "thus , if and only if , it cancels , we have both @xmath49 and @xmath50 , whereas @xmath29 , since it depends only on their ratio ( see equation ( [ 1a ] ) ) , tends towards a finite value . from equations ( [ 1a ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) we obtain for the position of the asymptotes @xmath51\\right\\ } } \\label{8}\\ ] ] it should be emphasized that the roots @xmath52 and @xmath53 , satisfying the condition @xmath54 , for a given value of the spin parameter @xmath27 , permit to define regions in the ergosphere from which unbound geodesics parallel to the z - axis emerge , along which move particles with ",
    "infinite energies and that could eventually explain the very energetic particles observed in cosmic rays .",
    "we will return to this point later .",
    "in order to simplify the mathematical analysis and without loss in the physical insight , we assume in this paper the particular case in which a double real root @xmath56 exists . under this assumption equation ( [ 1 ] ) can be recast as @xmath57 and equations ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) simplify as @xmath58y^{2 } } { a^{4}(1+y)+2a^{2}(y-1)y^{2}+(y-3)y^{4 } } \\label{10}\\ ] ] and @xmath59 when @xmath60 , of course we have also @xmath61 but , as already mentioned , their ratio tends towards a finite value in order that the coordinate @xmath29 remains finite , i.e. , @xmath62 } \\label{12}\\ ] ]    in order to perform some numerical estimates , we will assume , unless otherwise stated , a `` moderate '' rotation for the smbh , fixing @xmath63 ( a value adopted already by gmms10 in their investigation ) .",
    "hence , the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be plotted as shown in figures 1 and 2 .",

    "this is presently underway and will be reported in a future paper .",
    "nevertheless , the following aspects may be anticipated .",
    "as we have seen , in the case of a double root , geodesics followed by particles of sufficient high energy ( @xmath88 ) , remain clustered around values of @xmath77 corresponding to @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , in the general case the condition @xmath90 defines the regions from which high energy geodesics emerge .",
    "the later condition is given by a third order polynomial in @xmath53 , which has a unique real root that can be explicited as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "this can be inserted into equation ( [ 8 ] ) defining the position of the asymptote @xmath77 as a function only of @xmath52 .",
    "that leads again to very restricted ranges of possible values of @xmath77 .    for the sake of completeness and in order to investigate also the possible influence of the spin parameter in our analysis",

    ", @xmath242 can be expressed as a function of the coordinates @xmath243 and @xmath6 .",
    "for the case previously considered ( geodesic shown in figure 3 ) , the variation of the lorentz factor along the geodesic can be expressed as a function of the coordinate @xmath6 alone .",
    "the result is shown in figure 5 .",
    "notice that in the beginning the energy is essentially under the form of potential energy ( @xmath244 ) , while far from the ergosphere , the energy is essentially kinetic .     for the geodesic shown in figure 3 . ]",
    "taking the roots of the characteristic equation for unbound 2d - geodesics with @xmath26 as free parameters , we have shown that the two remaining constants of motion , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , of a test particle following geodesics that asymptotically tend to a parallel line to the @xmath6-axis , can be expressed as a function of the aforementioned parameters . in the particular case of a double root and assuming a spin parameter to be equal to @xmath63 , restricted domains of asymptotes corresponding to high particle energies are found .",
    "this means that the kerr metric can generate powerful collimated jets of high energy particles in some well defined regions inside the ergosphere . indeed , for this special case , only two possible ranges of @xmath245 are possible , namely @xmath246 $ ] and @xmath247 $ ] for @xmath248 and @xmath249 \\infty , \\sqrt{3}\\right ] $ ] respectively ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the present results are a strict consequence of the structure of the kerr metric .",
    "the main approximation is the assumption of the existence of a double real root @xmath85 for the characteristic equation .",
    "although we have considered in some more detail the case of a moderately spinning black hole ( @xmath216 ) , the results are qualitatively the same for the case of a extreme kerr black hole .",
    "we hope that by relaxing the double root hypothesis , maybe it would be possible to obtain thicker beams of energetic particles .",
    "an investigation is currently in progress and preliminary results are encouraging .",
    "two positions of the asymptote corresponding to an `` infinite '' energy in our model are @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "the latter is the only case compatible with the limitations imposed by the characteristics of the system of geodesic equations , according to our discussion in section 5 .",
    "the consequence of these mathematical constraints is that the resulting jet is very narrow .",
    "however , there is some observational evidence for the presence of radial flows in some jets ( giroletti et al .",
    "2004 ) and , as already mentioned , they may have a two - component flow , i.e. , a relativistic powerful inner jet and a slower , less powerful outer flow ( de villiers et al .",
    "2005 ; xie et al .",
    "the present model could be related to the inner flow which carries most of the power , being constituted mainly by relativistic particles .",
    "our results can also easily be extended to particles other than electrons , for example protons or heavy nuclei .",
    "this does not modify the `` geometry '' that we obtained , i.e. , the positions @xmath77 of the jets , but their energy only . for a proton ( @xmath2521 gev )",
    "the maximal energy we can here numerically calculate ( which is theoretically as large as wanted ) is about @xmath253 ev @xmath254 eev , which largely includes the highest energies of the current observed uhecr ( dermer et al .",
    "2009 ; hoover et al .",
    "thus , our model could be relevant to explain not only a collimated flux of relativistic particles but also the production of these very energetic particles that could be related to uhecr .",
    "a detailed analysis of the penrose process and of its efficiency is beyond the aim of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we would expect that the rate of emerging particles would be proportional to the accretion rate and to the ratio between the volume of the region in the ergosphere where unbound geodesics exist and the total volume of the ergosphere .",
    "a simple example of a penrose event could be the ionization of the inner shells of an iron atom inside the ergosphere , with the nucleus being captured by the bh and the electron being ejected with a high energy .",
    "the accreted gas near the ergosphere has temperatures around @xmath255 k ( montesinos & de freitas pacheco 2011 ) , high enough to ionize the k - l shells of iron , providing a theoretical basis for such a possibility .",
    "recent results of the pierre auger observatory ( roulet 2009 ) suggest a correlation between uhecr above 57 eev and nearby ( @xmath256 mpc ) agns .",
    "since in the present model the collimation of the relativistic particles occurs along the spin axis , it would be interesting to investigate if the associated agns are of type i or ii , since in the context of the  unified model \" these classes differ only by the inclination of the jet axis with respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "let us recall briefly that since our model does not require magnetic fields , it can be applied to neutral particles as , for instance , neutrinos .",
    "if they have a mass of @xmath257 ev ( steidl 2009 ) , according to our previous estimate , they could attain energies of the order of @xmath258 eev .",
    "finally , different authors have recently discussed the possibility to produce high energy particles by collisions near a rotating bh ( grib & pavlov 2011 ) , raising the interest of having further investigations on the penrose process ( see also baados at al 2011 ) .",
    "the present investigation can be seen as an additional contribution to this debate ."
