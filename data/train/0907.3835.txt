    "the supersonic . ]",
    "character of the evershed flow inside sunspot penumbrae is well established @xcite . already , @xcite measured velocities ( from stokes @xmath4 bisectors ) larger than 5 km s@xmath0 .",
    "more recent spectropolarimetric measurements have clearly established the existence of ubiquitous supersonic flows everywhere in the penumbra .",
    "1.5@xmath5 m infrared polarization spectra are particularly well suited for this purpose as the strong zeeman sensitivity of these lines , and to some extent the associated lower formation heights , allow to separate the sub- and supersonic components @xcite .",
    "using hinode / sp data ( in the 6301.5 and 6302.5    line pair ) @xcite identified stokes @xmath1 signals originated in the so - called penumbral dark cores @xcite that display three lobe profiles with velocities in the range of 6 - 7 km s@xmath0 . with similar hinode data , speeds of up to 9.5 km",
    "s@xmath0 have been reported recently @xcite .",
    "for these profiles to show up , it is crucial that the spot displays a sizeable line - of - sight ( los ) component of the evershed flow as helped by off disk center observations .",
    "these highly doppler shifted signals observed in both infrared and visible data clearly point to a magnetized nature of the evershed flow , which is compatible with the uncombed penumbral model of @xcite . in this model , nearly horizontal flux tubes with weaker field strengths @xcite carry the evershed flow .",
    "the horizontal tubes are embedded in a more vertical background field that has comparatively speaking smaller velocity flows .",
    "the dark core penumbral filaments have been solidly associated with the observational signature of horizontal penumbral flux tubes @xcite .",
    "the alternative proposal of a field free ambient where the evershed flow is localized @xcite faces the serious problem that no doppler - shifted stokes v signals are generated in this model .",
    "while the scenario in which penumbral flows take place has been clarified in recent years , the origin of the evershed flow and its final fate remain unclear . according to the simulations of @xcite ,",
    "the evolution of buoyant flux tubes inside the penumbra is such that an internal flow develops and attains speeds of up to 14 km s@xmath0 .",
    "these high speed flows could propagate beyond the outer penumbral boundary in some of these simulations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , @xcite found clear evidence that a large fraction of the flow is returning into the photosphere at the penumbral boundary , a well established result confirmed by a large number of modern observations . while this explains the signature of an abrupt end of the flow , it still does not answer the question of what happens to it once it dives down into the photosphere and outside of the main body of the spot .",
    "two recent results are relevant to understand what could be going on .",
    "first of all , the sunspot surroundings ( the ` moat ' ) have been seen to harbour horizontal filamentary magnetic fields as detected in soho / mdi magnetograms averaged over 10 hours @xcite .",
    "the bipolar moving magnetic feature ( mmf ) activity is seen to start well inside the penumbra and propagate in a coherent manner away from the spot ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* who detected a sea - serpent configuration ) . a second observational result of importance to ascertain the further evolution of the evershed flow is the close relation found by the existence of radially oriented penumbral filaments and the moat flow @xcite",
    "this has led these authors to propose a link between the evershed flow and the moat flow .",
    "all in all , the subsequent evolution of the flow beyond the penumbral border is unclear . in particular ,",
    "it is not known whether it maintains the supersonic character that both observations and simulations suggest .",
    "strong ( supersonic ) downflows have been detected by hinode in the moat region and , to a smaller extent , in other solar regions @xcite .",
    "similar large upflows have only been detected in the quiet sun by @xcite , who proposed that they represent evidence of a failed convective collapse process .",
    "all these flows have a clear spectral signature in stokes @xmath1 profiles that display a strong doppler - shifted third satellite lobe . in this letter",
    ", we report evidence of _ horizontal magnetic links _ between supersonic downflows and upflows at and beyond the penumbral boundary .",
    "it is proposed that these signatures reveal sporadic continuations of the ( supersonic ) evershed flow outside the spot .",
    "in order to understand to what degree the moat region is pervaded by horizontal magnetic fields , hinode / sp observations @xcite of a sunspot located very close to disk center were selected .",
    "it is important for this study that the moat region was located near disk center to maximize the sensitivity to horizontal fields in stokes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "disk center observations also allow to sense deeper into the photosphere , something which we consider important to improve the visibility of any horizontal magnetic fields residing in the moat .",
    "the hinode / sp map was obtained on the 28th of february of 2007 at 18:25 ut in the main , positive polarity , sunspot of noaa 10944 , which was located only 1.2 degrees off disk center .",
    "this data set was included in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows slit reconstructed images of the continuum intensity , stokes @xmath1 magnetogram ( scaled to display longitudinal fields over the outer penumbra and the moat ) and a total linear polarization map ( scaled to provide good visibility of transverse fields in the moat region ) .",
    "far - wing stokes @xmath1 magnetograms at about 250 m  at each side of line center were also constructed to help identifying strong up / downflow regions in the moat ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the linear polarization map was used as a reference for the existence of filamentary field aggregations beyond the penumbra . in this map ,",
    "a total of five regions were identified as transverse field concentrations that coincide along their length with flow signatures in the far - wing magnetograms ( although a thorough study was not performed , in particular many more transverse extensions are easily seen in the lp map of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the results of @xcite , who detected only downflows , the use of the transverse fields as a reference has allowed the identification of both upflows and downflows in the moat .",
    "the experience gained from the use of the far - wing magnetograms showed that the upflows observed have a tendency to be slightly weaker than the downflows , but the example presented in this letter has both flows of a similar magnitude .",
    "all of the five regions selected with transverse fields in the moat display a downflow / upflow spectral signature that we identify with a supersonic extension of the evershed flow along mostly horizontal field lines outside the spot . in this letter , we present a case example of this spectral signature and offer a simplified analysis of their quantitative implications . a more in depth study of all the regions in this map , including two - components sir inversions @xcite , is postponed to a future paper .",
    "the location of the case selected for this work as representative of the spectral signature of the continuation of the evershed flow in the moat region is marked by a sector in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as it is evident in the linear polarization frame of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , this region is coexisting with transverse fields in the moat but is not particularly prominent in the longitudinal magnetogram ( that mostly shows the well - known mmf activity ) .",
    "the stokes profiles along the segment in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are shown in figure [ fig2 ] ( note that this is a composite that does not corresponds to any actual slit position ) .",
    "this figure already displays the fingerprint of the evershed flow continuation which is marked by the two arrows near the bottom of the frames .",
    "the stokes @xmath1 profile shows the existence of a satellite third lobe at the red and blue sides of the rest position .",
    "the downflows and upflows are spatially separated by slightly less than 1 arcsec ( the scale in this figure is @xmath6 0.15 arcsec / px ) .",
    "interestingly , the flows are also evident in the stokes @xmath2 and @xmath3 signals .",
    "the first downflow occurs within the penumbra ( and it would correspond to a supersonic version of the cases found by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the upflow occurs just outside the visible penumbra .",
    "continuous @xmath2 and @xmath3 signals show that we are tracing an extension of horizontal field lines from within the penumbra .",
    "it is important to point out that these horizontal fields must reside at the line forming region but probably slightly above the @xmath7 layer as no darkening is seen in the continuum maps .",
    "this changes at coordinate # 23 ( ref . to fig . [ fig2 ] ) , where the penumbra reappears in continuum .",
    "a weaker downflow occurs at this location ( not marked ) and has a polarity opposite to that of the spot .",
    "the region where the penumbra is seen to reappear coincides also with weaker @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 signals indicating that the field lines are probably buried in deeper layers , filling more the continuum forming layer than the line forming region .",
    "similar ( albeit slightly less evident ) penumbral reappearances are seen in two of the other four cases of flow extensions detected in this sunspot .",
    "in order to quantify the flow velocities that are needed to reproduce the spectral satellites seen in fig . [ fig2 ] , a simplified analysis was made ( following the multilobe analysis made by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is based on fitting gaussians to the various lobes observed in stokes @xmath1 and on referring their local maximums to a wavelength ` rest ' position . for this reference , we select the network point at coordinate # 36 as it is well - known that these concentrations do not display large velocities .",
    "two gaussians are first fitted to the network point obtaining the rest wavelengths for both the blue and red lobes .",
    "then , a three gaussian combination is fitted to the profiles at coordinates # 7 ( downflow ) and # 10 ( upflow ) .",
    "the resulting fits are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the maximum of the extreme red and blue lobes , once compared with the center of the corresponding network lobes , provide an estimate of the flow speed that must be present to produce these satellite spectral signatures . in the case of the downflow of point # 7 , the results are 6.7 km s@xmath0 for 6301.5    and of 6.3 km s@xmath0 for 6302.5  . in the upflowing stream of point",
    "# 10 , we obtain -5.9 km s@xmath0 and -6.3 km",
    "s@xmath0 , for the same lines respectively . these velocities correspond to los components of the stream flow . as the flow signature",
    "is also seen in stokes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , it is clear that there is a significant inclination of the corresponding field lines indicating that the flow speeds could be considerably larger than 6 km s@xmath0 .",
    "a four gaussian fit to the two non - network profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] was also attempted , but no convincing results were obtained .",
    "this indicates that the stokes @xmath1 profile corresponding to the satellite profiles are well reproduced with only one lobe , something that indicates the presence of strong gradients in this component .",
    "while we postpone a more detailed discussion of these profiles to a future paper , we note that already the supersonic profiles observed by @xcite were explained with a single - lobe doppler shifted component with very strong los gradients .    as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the two blue and red satellite lobes are positive ( which corresponds with the white signals at each side of the rest stokes @xmath1 profile in fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it is important to understand the implications of these signs in the doppler - shifted component as they readily show that the supersonic flow corresponds to an _",
    "outward _ directed flow from the spot ( as it should be for an extension of the evershed flow outside the spot ) . the rationale is as follows .",
    "the parent sunspot positive polarity produces a stokes @xmath1 profile with a positive blue lobe and a negative red lobe ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "if these field lines have to return back into the photosphere , the polarity is reversed ( positive red lobe ) .",
    "if , in addition , there is a redshift of the signal created by a downflowing stream , the lobe that will be seen further away from the rest wavelength will , then , be positive .",
    "similarly , if the field lines reemerge to the surface , they preserve the spot polarity ( positive blue lobe ) which together with an upflowing stream ( blue shifting the profile ) produces a displaced positive stokes @xmath1 lobe . the same arguments lead to the conclusion that a radial flow streaming into the spot would have had negative doppler shifted lobes in fig . [ fig3 ] ( or black satellites at both sides of the main profile in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "all five regions identified in the surroundings of this sunspot with strong transverse fields have shown positive satellite signals in stokes @xmath1 .",
    "we report on the finding of highly doppler - shifted stokes @xmath1 satellite lobes at each side of the normal rest profiles , revealing the presence of downflowing and upflowing material moving away from the spot .",
    "the spectral signature of the doppler shifted stokes @xmath1 lobes is seen along extensions of the penumbra that display strong transverse fields .",
    "the flow speeds inferred by a simple gaussian fit show los directed speeds of @xmath6 6 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the transverse field character of this signature ( at hinode / sp resolution ) suggests that the real flow along the field lines would be considerably larger and is likely to be supersonic .",
    "five such transverse field extensions with positive satellite stokes @xmath1 lobes in the blue and red side of the rest spectral profile have been detected .",
    "the fact that the sign of the these lobes is positive ( for a positive polarity spot ) indicates that the local flow is directed in the radial direction _ away _ from the spot .",
    "this property , together with the high - speed ( supersonic ) character and the presence of , at least , five such channels all around the spot , strongly suggest that these profiles represent the continuation of the evershed flow outside the spot , into the moat region .",
    "it is also clear that , being the evershed flow ubiquitous within the penumbra , the finding of five cases of its extension outside the spot can hardly explain where the bulk of the penumbral flow ends .",
    "we hypothesize that a mechanism such as convective pumping @xcite is able to submerge below the surface most of the ( horizontal ) field lines that carry the majority of the evershed _",
    "flow_. however , it is clear that this mechanism will not always be perfect and often will fail to submerge a particular set of field lines that might become visible , corresponding to the cases detected in this work .",
    "it is also clear that our findings prove that the evershed flow can continue beyond the penumbral boundary preserving the supersonic character it normally attains within the penumbra .",
    "it is unclear at present whether the preservation of this supersonic character is precisely the reason why these flows are not hidden below the surface , allowing them to be detected in the hinode data",
    ". it could well be that if the flow remains supersonic , the convective pumping mechanism is less efficient at submerging the corresponding field lines .",
    "more systematic studies of how often one finds these satellite spectral signatures surrounding sunspots and their temporal evolution are needed to settle this point .",
    "hinode is a japanese mission developed and launched by isas / jaxa , with naoj as domestic partner and nasa and stfc ( uk ) as international partners .",
    "it is operated by these agencies in cooperation with esa and nsc ( norway ) .",
