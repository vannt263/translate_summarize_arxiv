    "this analysis showed that cmb temperature fluctuations are consistent with the simplest inflationary models with plateau - like inflaton potentials with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these models are single fields and predict a nearly gaussian scale invariant power spectrum .",
    "the planck team also considered the running of the spectral index , @xmath7 , as the next correction to the power law power spectrum and found that , for @xmath8 , the cmb data would favor the power spectrum with a negligible running @xcite dn_s / dk=-0.0084 0.0082  ( 68   %  , )  .",

    "when we use the combined bkp data , @xmath125 becomes comparable with the corresponding parameter in the other models .",
    "it is known that the reheating temperatures allowed by the starobinsky model is @xmath137 @xcite , which gives @xmath138 .",
    "considering the @xmath139 uncertainty , this theoretical prediction is satisfied by the results reported in table 1 for the starobinsky model .    cdm model ( solid black curve ) in comparison with the starobinsky potential ( dashed red curve ) for the parameter values quoted in tables i and ii given using the planck tt + lowp data .",

    "[ fig : stupendous]_,width=480,height=288 ]    for the @xmath21cdm model , we estimate the scalar and tensor power spectra using equations and . with the planck tt + lowp and bkp data sets",
    ", one can constrain the spectral index @xmath133 , the running of the spectral index @xmath37 , and the running of running of the spectral index @xmath28 .",
    "the results are summarized in table ii . clearly , @xmath125 is better in this case than the corresponding values for the chaotic potential presented in table i. this can be explained by the presence of more free parameters . for instance , in comparison with the chaotic potential , the @xmath21cdm model has 3 additional parameters .",
    "interestingly , the starobinsky model shows a better fit with fewer free parameters . using two data sets ,",
    "we have also found negligible values for running , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .",
    "fig . 1 presents the angular power spectra , @xmath142 , for the cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "in this figure , the solid black curve represents the @xmath142 for the @xmath21cdm model with the best fit parameters obtained using the planck tt + lowp data .",
    "the red dashed curve represents the @xmath142 for the starobinsky potential . to obtain this curve ,",
    "we have changed the camb to contain the scalar and tensor power spectrum related to the starobinsky model which was calculated in previous section using the best fit value of @xmath143 .",
    "we have also plotted the cmb planck 2015 data for comparison . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the suppression of @xmath142 predicted by the starobinsky model for @xmath144 is the most important factor in reducing the likelihood compared to the @xmath21cdm model .",
    "in inflationary models , it is important to know how the model predictions can be compared with observational data . a variety of methods have been proposed in the literature for such comparisons . in this work",
    ", we presented a new method for simple models of inflation . in this method , we first expanded the logarithm of scalar and tensor power spectra around the pivot scale to found the series terms for the single field inflation models as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the expansion terms are denoted by the spectral index , the running , the running of running , and so on . in order to find the series terms",
    ", we had to solve the equations of motion for the inflaton field , @xmath13 , at the background to find @xmath13 as a function of the e - folding number , @xmath44 , and to calculate the power spectra as a function of @xmath44 . using this approach",
    ", we were able to find the series terms in the final step .",
    "for the three types of single field inflation models with simple potentials studied here , we were able to evaluate the sums and find the spectral indexes and , thereby , the power spectra as a function of @xmath14 with one or two free parameters depending on the model .",
    "we compared such new power spectra with the standard power spectra of the @xmath21cdm model consisting of @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath3 variables by using the modified version of camb and cosmomc codes as well as the recent planck tt + lowp and bkp data .",
    "the goodness of fit of the specific inflationary models with @xmath44 as the free parameter was found to be comparable with that of the @xmath21cdm model for planck tt + lowp and bkp data sets . in the case of starobinsky model",
    ", the new parametrization yielded a better fit . using this analysis , we were also able to constrain the e - folding number for any inflation model . for an instantaneous reheating stage",
    ", one expects the bound @xmath135 . we compared the best fit values of @xmath44 calculated for different models using this bound .",
    "it was found that the models that predict the worst values of @xmath125 also predict the @xmath44 parameter outside of this bound .",
    "we expect that our method of analyzing the inflationary models can be extended to other models with more complex potentials .",
