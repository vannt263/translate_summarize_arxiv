    "in nucleon induced intermediate energy reactions , a single - step reaction model is the simplest way to understand the complex interaction between nucleon and nucleus .",
    "however , it is insufficient to explain the cross sections at large angles @xcite .",
    "various groups @xcite introduced multistep direct processes to compensate for the lack of cross sections in these regions .",
    "they calculated angular distributions of the two - step @xcite and three - step direct processes @xcite and found that multistep direct processes contribute significantly towards the understanding of nucleon induced intermeditate energy reactions .",
    "the two - step processes have also been applied @xcite to the long - standing @xmath4 problem in spin - isospin excitations . with the random phase approximation ( rpa ) ,",
    "the spin - longitudinal response function @xmath5 is enhanced and the peak of its energy spectrum is shifted downwards , while the spin - transverse response function @xmath6 is quenched and its peak is shifted upwards @xcite .",
    "the theoretical ratio @xmath4 should be greater than 1 .",
    "these quantities are extracted experimentally from the measurement of the polarization transfer coefficients @xcite . with these observables ,",
    "the ratio is found to be less than 1 and is inconsistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "the spin - longitudinal cross section @xmath7 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath5 @xcite , is roughly reproduced by the distorted - wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) with the rpa correlation in the lower energy transfer region as shown in fig .",
    "[ dwia ] , but as the energy transfer increases the theoretical results become smaller than the experimental results @xcite . in the spin - transverse cross section @xmath8 , which corresponds to @xmath6 , theoretical estimates reproduce only about half of the experimental result in the whole energy transfer region @xcite .",
    "nakaoka and ichimura @xcite calculated the two - step contribution to @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the @xmath9 reactions within the framework of the plane - wave approximation to evaluate the relative contributions from the one- and the two - step processes .",
    "theoretical results including two - step contributions were closer to the experimental results than the dwia predictions for @xmath7 , but they still underestimated @xmath8 .    in this formalism",
    "we assumed that the path lengths of the incident particles in the target nucleus for the one - step and the two - step processes are nearly equal , and the effects of absorption in the one - step and the two - step processes are similar .",
    "since we wanted to evaluate the relative contributions from the one - step and the two - step processes , we removed the effect of absorption from both processes .    because of the singularity that appears in the green s function in the two - step processes , numerical integration is difficult .",
    "an on - energy shell approximation to the green s function was used as shown in our previous paper @xcite . however , since this approximation may not be reliable it is not used herein .    in this paper , we utilize the finite @xmath10 in the denominator of the green s function in order to avoid the singularity and calculate the numerical integration beyond the on - energy shell in the transferred momentum space",
