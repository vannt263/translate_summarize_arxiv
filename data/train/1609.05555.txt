    "quantum inseparability mostly known as entanglement @xcite is proven to be an important ingredient for various information processing tasks , where this non classical resource outperforms any classical resource i.e. , teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite so on and so forth .",
    "not only _ entanglement _ but quantum mechanics possesses more non striking phenomena where joint probability distribution arising out from composite systems can not be reproduced by any local realistic theory which was the pioneering work by john bell known as _ bell s theorem _",
    "non - local quantum correlation is found to be fundamental resource for device independent certification of randomness @xcite , cryptography@xcite , dimension witness @xcite , bayesian game theoretic applications @xcite , quantum network@xcite , etc . , where entanglement only is not sufficient to guarantee the advantage , we need more powerful correlation . recently , there are lots of study on another non classical phenomena commonly known as quantum steering @xcite , which was originally invented long back by schrdinger .",
    "quantum steering describes a scenario where one of the subsystem controls the conditional state of spatially separated party by sharing a suitable quantum state and applying appropriate measurements on his or her part .",
    "quantum steering has been explained as semi device independent entanglement witness in contrary to bell non local device independent scenario .",
    "quantum steering can be thought as weaker form of non locality .",
    "these three types of quantum correlation make a hierarchy where all entangled states may not be steerable and nonlocal , all steerable states are necessarily entangled but not necessarily nonlocal and all nonlocal states are both entangled and steerable .",
    "multipartite extension of correlation has gained lots of attention in recent times@xcite . though the idea of entanglement , nonlocality and steering in multipartite scenario is not as simple and straight forward analogous to bi - partite case , complexity increases with number of party . in this context",
    ", it may be fruitful if we comment on global system by investing conditional bipartite marginal system . + extending the previous results @xcite popescu demonstrated the nonlocality of @xmath0 qubit pure entangled state by using only bipartite bell - chsh inequalities@xcite .",
    "he in particular argued that for any @xmath0 qubit pure entangled state , if there exists a global projective measurement on any possible @xmath1 systems out of the @xmath0 systems that leaves the remaining conditional bipartite state as a pure entangled state , resulting in a violation of bipartite bell - chsh inequality , then that guarantees that the pure @xmath0 qubit entangled state is nonlocal .",
    "his argument therefore characterizes nonlocality of a pure @xmath0 partite entangled state .",
    "however , from experimental perspectives , it will be more interesting to analogously characterize nonlocality of @xmath0 partite mixed entangled states . in the present work we intend to contribute in this direction . to be more precise",
    ", our present topic of discussion mainly explores the possibility to reveal nonlocality of any mixed entangled tripartite state by observing nonlocality of any conditional bipartite state obtained from the tripartite state due to suitable projective measurement by any of the three parties . for",
    "that we define a new form of tripartite nonlocality in which the tripartite state is said to be nonlocal if any of the conditional bipartite states captures steering nonlocality .",
    "the rest of the article is ordered as follows : in sec.[mot ] we discuss the motivations that deem the importance of this work .",
    "sec.[prelim ] provides the necessary preliminaries to set the premise to present our results . in sec.[cs ] we define the concept of conditional steering and present our findings .",
    "we conclude in sec.[concl ] .",
    "nonlocal correlations obtained from entangled quantum states are useful for various information processing tasks@xcite .",
    "consequently any nonlocal quantum state can be considered as a useful resource . in this context",
    "one can try to capture ability of a state , which may be declared local based on all existing notions of nonlocality , to reveal any weaker form of nonlocality atleast in some weaker sense .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the author showed that mixed entangled bipartite quantum state having a local description can be used to certify randomness in a measurement device independent randomness certification task .",
    "+ from practical view point , the topic becomes more interesting if one tries to characterize nonlocal behavior of multipartite mixed entangled quantum states .",
    "this basically motivates our present discussion . precisely speaking",
    ", we have defined a new form of tripartite nonlocality in spirit of popescu(discussed later ) .",
    "in contrast to popescu s approach@xcite , we have considered steering nonlocality , a weaker form of nonlocality of the conditional states arising due to some suitable projective measurements by one of the three parties sharing the tripartite state .",
    "this in turn emerges as a useful tool to characterize nonlocality of some mixed tripartite states which are local in standard bell scenario@xcite and also may not be even genuinely steerable .",
    "this in turn enhances the possibility of the corresponding tripartite state to be used as a suitable candidate in any information theoretic task .",
    "interestingly we observed that for any tripartite state to be nonlocal according to our notion of nonlocality , it need not be genuinely entangled .",
    "so any biseparable state can also exhibit this form of nonlocality .",
    "besides , we also explored other related issues thereby encountering some additional observations in this context . + having sketched our motivation , we are now in a position to present our work .",
    "but first we provide with some mathematical tools which are to be used later in our discussion .",
    "in a bipartite scenario the correlation terms are steerable from alice to bob if they are inexplicable by any local hidden variable(lhv ) -local hidden state(lhs ) model @xcite : @xmath2\\ ] ] where @xmath3 denotes the hidden variable , @xmath4 , @xmath5 denote local results , @xmath6 , the corresponding local inputs and @xmath7 is the projection operator corresponding to an observable characterized by bob s setting @xmath8 , associated with the eigenvalue @xmath5 and @xmath9 corresponds to some pure state of bob s system , parameterized by hidden variable @xmath3 .",
    "so if @xmath10 be a bipartite quantum state shared in between alice and bob and if the correlations arising due to their measurements , lack a decomposition in the above form(eq.([pst1 ] ) ) then @xmath10 is said to be steerable from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "steering being an asymmetric phenomenon , @xmath10 s steerability from @xmath11 to @xmath12 does not necessarily imply its steerability from @xmath12 to @xmath11 @xcite .      here",
    "we discuss two existing criteria for detecting bipartite steering @xcite .      in @xcite zukowski et.al .",
    "gave a criteria which suffices to detect steerability of a bipartite quantum state .",
    "the key feature of their criteria is that if @xmath14 and @xmath15(members of an arbitrary hilbert space ) are such that @xmath16 then definitely @xmath17 for their purpose they considered quantum correlation function @xmath18 and non steerable correlation function(local hidden state correlations)@xmath19 .",
    "@xmath18 is defined as : @xmath20\\ ] ] @xmath10 is the bipartite quantum state having local dimension @xmath21 shared between the two parties alice and bob .",
    "now any state density matrix can be decomposed as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the identity operator in the hilbert space of qubit k and @xmath24 are the pauli operators along three perpendicular directions , @xmath25 .",
    "the components @xmath26 are real and given by : @xmath27,\\,i_1,i_2\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}\\ ] ] using eq.([st4 ] ) , @xmath28 becomes @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the cartesian coordinates of the bloch vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 defining corresponding measurement alignments and @xmath34 denoting the elements of the correlation tensor @xmath35 corresponding to the density matrix @xmath36 the non steerable correlation function(@xmath37 ) can be defined as(@xcite ) : @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 denoting the quantum particle on bob s side . in @xcite , zukowski et.al . showed that the quantum state(@xmath10 ) shared between alice and bob is steerable(from alice to bob ) if the corresponding correlation functions satisfy the following bell - type inequality : @xmath42 using this basic geometric approach they designed a sufficient criteria for steering : @xmath43 denote spectral norm and hilbert - schmidt norm of @xmath35 respectively .",
    "any quantum state which satisfies this criteria([st8 ] ) is steerable in nature .",
    "we define a measure of bipartite steering @xmath13 where : @xmath44 hence any negative value of @xmath13 indicates that the bipartite state(@xmath10 ) shared between alice and bob is steerable from alice to bob .",
    "however , if any state fails to satisfy it(eq.([st8 ] ) ) ,",
    "i.e. , for any positive value of @xmath13 , the steerability of the state can not be guaranteed .",
    "given density matrix representation of a bipartite state(@xmath10 ) , the correlation tensor matrix @xmath35 having elements @xmath46(eq.([st4i ] ) ) can have a singular value decomposition : @xmath47 where @xmath48 represent orthogonal matrices whereas @xmath49 denotes a diagonal matrix containing singular values(@xmath50 ) of @xmath35 .",
    "now any element from the collection @xmath51 is either sands for a rotation or can be interpreted as a product of rotation along with the parity matrix @xmath52 . so in totality @xmath35",
    "can always be represented in the form : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a diagonal matrix @xmath55 which may now have negative elements and @xmath56 stand for proper rotations(@xmath57 ) .",
    "clearly , if @xmath35 itself is a diagonal matrix then @xmath58 . let for any @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the modified versions of the terms @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively after applying @xmath64 and @xmath65 on first and second qubits respectively .",
    "as any rotation(@xmath66 ) can be implemented by local unitary operations which correspond to local basis change , so any property of the state(@xmath10 ) remains intact and hence correlation matrix of any state(@xmath10 ) can be diagonalized without altering steerability of @xmath10 .",
    "+ let @xmath10 be shared between alice and bob .",
    "let bob can measure anyone of @xmath67 or @xmath68 , with @xmath69)$ ] and alice can measure on her qubit hermitian observables of the form @xmath70 , @xmath71 by choosing @xmath72 and @xmath73 , zevtic etal.@xcite modified a pre existing epr steering inequality@xcite , thereby framing the nonlinear epr steering inequality : @xmath74 if correlations arising due to local measurements on any bipartite state @xmath10 can be explained by a lhv - lhs model(eq.([pst1]))then @xmath10 necessarily satisfies the above inequality(eq.([st8i ] ) ) .",
    "so violation of this inequality is sufficient to claim that the state(@xmath10 ) is steerable from alice to bob . considering all possible permutations of @xmath75 , the sufficient criteria for detecting steerability of @xmath10",
    "was ultimately framed as@xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 we define : @xmath78 as the second measure of bipartite steering .",
    "so any positive value of @xmath45 guarantees that the bipartite state(@xmath10 ) is steerable from alice to bob .",
    "+ now we are going to discuss the criteria of detecting genuine steering which have explored recently@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the author presented a scenario to detect genuine tripartite steering(svetlichny steering)based on svetlichny inequality .",
    "the detection criterion is given as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote two inequivalent facets of bell - chsh polytope . here",
    "@xmath82 denote the settings of alice , bob and charlie , @xmath83 denotes nonlocal hidden state and @xmath84 implies that two parties alice and bob have access to qubit measurements whereas the third party charlie does not trust his measurement devices and hence are uncharacterized .",
    "the measurement settings of alice and bob should be such that the corresponding bipartite correlation terms can violate chsh inequality .",
    "if a given quantum state be such that the correlations arising due to measurements on it violate this inequality(eq.([pst5 ] ) ) , then the state is genuine steerable from charlie to alice and bob .",
    "similarly steerability of a tripartite state from alice to charlie and bob and that from bob to charlie and alice can be detected respectively by the following criteria : @xmath85 @xmath86 where the terms @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 are analogously defined .",
    "so in totatlity if any state violates any one of these three criteria(eqs.[pst5],[pst5a],[pst5b ] ) , then the state is genuinely steerable from one party to the remaining two parties .",
    "however if it can not violate any of these inequalities(sufficient to detect genuine steerability ) then the state may not be genuinely steerable .",
    "having discussed about two measures(@xmath13 , @xmath45 of bipartite steering ) along with the criteria of genuine steering , we are now going to present some more mathematical tools to relate our work with nonlocality and some information processing tasks such as teleportation .",
    "let @xmath91 be a given tripartite quantum state shared between three parties alice , bob and charlie .",
    "let @xmath92 and @xmath93 denote the inputs and outputs of alice , bob and charlie respectively .",
    "the correlations arising from the measurements of the three parties on their respective subsystems are nonlocal if those can not be decomposed in the form @xmath94p(c|z,\\lambda).\\ ] ] and the corresponding state is said to be nonlocal .",
    "such type of correlations are capable of violating tri - partite bell inequality . in @xcite sliwa",
    "defined a bell - local polytope having @xmath95 facets such that if the correlations arising due to local measurements by each of the three parties on their respective subsystems violate atleast one of those @xmath95 facet inequalities then that guarantees that the corresponding quantum state @xmath91(say)shared in between the three parties is nonlocal .",
    "negativity of entanglement was first introduced by zyczkowski _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite and then vidal _ e.t al . _",
    "@xcite introduced it as a bipartite measure of entanglement .",
    "an important property of this measure is that , it is computable not only for pure state , but also for mixed state .",
    "the definition of negativity originates from the failure of peres criterion .",
    "this criterion states that under partial transpose , a density matrix associated with a separable state is still a density matrix i.e. , the corresponding matrix remains positive semi definite .",
    "thus a state with negative partial transpose must be entangled .",
    "let @xmath96 be a bipartite state of a composite system of dimension @xmath97 .",
    "then negativity of @xmath96 is denoted by @xmath98 and is defined as @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the partial transpose of @xmath96 on the sub system @xmath4 and @xmath101 denotes the trace norm , i.e. , @xmath102 . according to the definition , the quantity @xmath98 is equals to the twice sum of the absolute values of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath100 .",
    "+ negativity of entanglement is strongly related to the ghz distillability of three - qubit system @xcite .",
    "if the partial transpose of a three qubit state with respect to any subsystem is negative , a ghz state can be distilled from the three qubit state by locc .",
    "thus , a three - qubit state is ghz distillable if negativity of any bipartite cut of the system is positive .",
    "+ now we define our premise .",
    "a tripartite state @xmath91 is shared between alice , bob and charlie .",
    "let charlie first performs a projective measurement @xmath103 on his qubit and broadcast the output to rest .",
    "the resulting conditional bipartite state between the rest of the parties , i.e. , alice and bob is denoted by , @xmath104\\ ] ] in a similar way , when alice or bob performs projective measurements on the conditional states between the rest of the parties can be written as @xmath105 or @xmath106 respectively .",
    "now we want to check whether @xmath107 is steerable from bob to alice then that guarantees that bob can steer particle of one of the two trusted parties .",
    "such type of tripartite states from which one can obtain conditional states that are steerable , are defined as _ conditionally steerable _ state(steerable from bob to alice in this case ) and corresponding tripartite correlation terms as _ conditional steering _ correlations .",
    "the nomenclature is justified based on the fact that one of the three parties can steer qubit of one of the two remaining parties in spirit of popescu @xcite where they ask the question for non local scenario .",
    "so any conditionally steerable tripartite state exhibits a weaker form of nonlocality which can be defined as _ conditional steering",
    "nonlocality_. +      let @xmath91 be a given quantum state shared between three parties .",
    "let one of the two parties(say charlie ) having access to qubit measurements performs a single projective measurement on his qubit and communicates the output(say , @xmath108 ) to other two parties .",
    "consequently other two parties now share a conditional state @xmath109 . if the state density matrix of @xmath109 satisfies atleast one of the sufficient criteria of steering(eqs([st7i],[st8iv ] ) ) then that guarantees that @xmath109 is steerable from alice to bob .",
    "this in turn guarantees that the tripartite quantum state(@xmath91 ) possesses conditional steering nonlocality .",
    "however , as discussed above , both of the steering criteria , are sufficient and not necessary , if @xmath109 fails to satisfy both of them then no definite conclusion can be made about the steerability of the conditional state and hence about conditional steerability of the original state @xmath91 .",
    "for instance , let mixed ghz state be shared between the three parties : @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes identity matrix .",
    "let alice and charlie can perform qubit measurements and bob can perform only black - box type measurements .",
    "let alice performs a projective measurement in any arbitrary direction : @xmath112 where @xmath113.$ ] let projection of the qubit in up and down direction along the vector @xmath114 be denoted as @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively . for a particular example , let @xmath117 and let alice obtains output @xmath115 .",
    "let @xmath118 denotes the conditional state .",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath35 of @xmath118 has a diagonal form : @xmath119 .",
    "the elements @xmath62 and @xmath63 are all @xmath120 except @xmath121 and @xmath122 each of which turns out to be @xmath123 for @xmath118 , the steering criteria(@xmath13 , @xmath45 ) have the form : @xmath124 @xmath125 again the conditional state(@xmath118 ) is bell - chsh local@xcite for : @xmath126 the conditional steerable states from the family(eq.([pst8 ] ) ) are those which satisfy either @xmath127(eq.([pst9i ] ) ) or @xmath128(eq.([pst9ii ] ) ) or both .",
    "so these two criteria impose some restrictions over noise parameter @xmath129 which varies with the measurement parameter @xmath130(see fig.1 ) .",
    "the optimal result is obtained for @xmath131(see fig.2 ) .",
    "clearly , eq.([pst9i ] ) implies that for @xmath131 , @xmath127 for any value of @xmath132 so mixed ghz state exhibits conditional steering nonlocality for any value of the noise parameter(@xmath129 ) greater than @xmath133 .",
    "+ ghz symmetric states , a class of of tripartite mixed entangled states , important from quantum theoretical perspective has been topic of many recent research activities@xcite . the class is given by : + @xmath134 @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",

    "so conditionally steerable states from this class of states are obtained over a restricted region in state parameter space @xmath144(see fig.3 ) as detected by the two sufficient criteria of steering(eqs.([st7i],[st8iv ] ) ) .     for which corresponding member of the noisy ghz family(eq.([pst8]))is conditionally steerable .",

    "_ , title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] [ 2 ]     + having introduced and citing some particular examples of conditionally steerable states from some known classes of tripartite mixed entangled states , we are now in a position to compare this weaker form of nonlocality with some existing notions of nonlocality which in turn points out that this notion of nonlocality enhances utility of any tripartite state which may otherwise be treated as useless . from application view point , it is interesting to explore whether by using the notion of conditional steering nonlocality one can increase the resistance to noise of any noisy tripartite state .",

    "<S> interestingly we find that the tripartite state need not be nonlocal to demonstrate conditional steering . </S>"
