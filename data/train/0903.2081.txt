    "the physical meaning of replacing the exact density by its average is to spread the local shear forces exerted by the cantilevers on the beam around their support in order to form a continuous force density .",

    ", the modal shape of the beam is the same for the antenna as it would be for a beam _ without cantilevers attached _ , a result also confirmed by finite element analysis @xcite .",
    "this surprising fact originates in the special form of the force density exerted by the cantilevers on the beam that is proportional to the beam deflection @xmath68 , thereby producing no change in the modal shape even though the frequency spectrum is modified by the first term of eq . for @xmath69 .",

    "[ figgamma11n12vslln ] , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "thus , if the cantilever length is half the beam s , the 1st collective frequency of the structure does not depend on the number of cantilevers attached and is equal to the fundamental frequency of the central beam alone .",
    "although this conclusion is drawn from our continuum approach , it has been verified for the dynamics of the exact 3d structure solved by the finite - element method .",
    "we also note that , all other parameters being fixed , the density of states ( number of states per unit frequency ) increases with @xmath43 and that , for @xmath73 , the lower band edges generically shift upwards .",
    "the opposite occurs however for the first band ( fundamental group ) whose lower edge shifts downwards as @xmath43 increases .",

    "this example shows how the frequency spectrum of a more complex antenna structure can be easily understood and provides a way of engineering frequency spectra with specific features useful in experiments .",
    "it has been observed experimentally @xcite that , if in addition to being driven at the frequency of the fundamental mode the antenna is also driven at the frequency of the collective mode , the frequency peak of the fundamental mode experiences a slight shift .",
    "this frequency shift is the signature of a modal coupling that occurs because of the presence of nonlinearity and dissipation in the system @xcite . to explain the interaction of these two widely spaced modes , we investigate the effect of a two - frequency driving on the response of a weakly nonlinear and dissipative antenna structure .",
    "we supplement the equations of motion of our continuum model , eqs . and , with nonlinear terms that take into account the possible material and geometrical nonlinearities of the structure and with damping terms proportional to the transverse velocity of the elements .",

    "<S> we propose a general one - dimensional _ continuous _ formulation to analyze the vibrational modes of antenna - like nanomechanical resonators consisting of two symmetric arrays of cantilevers affixed to a central nano - beam . </S>",
    "<S> the cantilever arrays can have arbitrary density and length profile along the beam . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the secular equation that allows for the determination of their frequency spectrum and illustrate the results on the particular examples of structures with constant or alternating cantilever length profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our analytical results capture the vibration spectrum of such resonators and elucidate key relationships that could prove advantageous for experimental device performance . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , using a perturbative approach to treat the nonlinear and dissipative dynamics of driven structures , we analyze the anharmonic coupling between two specific widely spaced modes of the coupled - element device , with direct application to experiments . </S>"
