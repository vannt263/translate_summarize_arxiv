    "the proton structure has been widely explored in inclusive measurements , mainly in deeply inelastic lepton - proton scattering ( dis ) . here",
    "the scattering essentially occurs due to the exchange of a virtual boson ( photon ) between lepton and a single parton , and so one can access _ parton distribution functions _ ( pdfs ) . these universal , however , convention - dependent functions @xmath3 are interpreted as probabilities that partons of certain flavour @xmath4 will be found with given longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath5 .",
    "since the pdfs are naturally defined in a translation invariant manner , they do not carry information about the transversal distribution of partons .",
    "some information about transversal degrees of freedom can be obtained from elastic lepton - proton scattering .",
    "namely , the electromagnetic form factors @xmath6 are fourier transforms of the electric and magnetic charge distribution in nucleon , and can be , e.g. , in the infinite momentum frame , interpreted as probability that partons are found at some transversal distance @xmath7 from the center - of - mass .",
    "however , one should not assume that a realistic probability distribution of partons , given by a two - variable function @xmath8 is simply a direct product , i.e. , @xmath9 , of two probability functions .",
    "rather it is anticipated that longitudinal and transversal degrees of freedom have a cross talk , e.g. , as @xmath5 gets bigger partons carry more of the nucleon longitudinal momentum and are expected to be closer to the proton center , and thus the @xmath7 dependence in @xmath10 should become narrower with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the three dimensional distribution of partons in the nucleon can be addressed within more general objects , called _ generalized parton distributions _ ( gpds ) @xcite .",
    "such distributions can be revealed by analyzing hard exclusive leptoproduction of mesons or photon .",
    "the theoretical description of the former processes is perhaps more problematic , but they offer a direct view into individual flavour gpds . to the latter one",
    "the _ deeply virtual compton scattering _ ( dvcs ) process contributes , where one photon has a large virtuality .",
    "dvcs is theoretically considered as the cleanest probe of gpds , however , here only certain flavour combinations of gpds appear .",
    "the non - forward compton scattering process is described by the compton tensor @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the generalized bjorken limit corresponds to @xmath15 with the scaling variables @xmath16 and the momentum transfer squared @xmath17 being fixed .",
    "note that in the forward case , i.e. , @xmath18 , the hadronic dis tensor @xmath19 is related to the _ forward _ compton scattering tensor by the optical theorem @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "gpds encode a unified description of the proton structure and they are experimentally accessible via the hard leptoproduction of photon or mesons . we have shown that the representation of compton form factors as mellin - barnes integrals offers a useful tool in analyzing dvcs : the inclusion of evolution is simple , numerical treatment is stable and fast .",
    "although the motivation for this representation originated from manifest conformal symmetry at lo , we have shown here that this mellin  barnes integral representation can be used within the standard @xmath23 scheme beyond lo . such a representation can be straightforwardly obtained from the momentum fraction representation and , therefore , also other gpd related processes , e.g. , the hard electroproduction of mesons , can be given in terms of mellin ",
    "barnes integrals .",
    "this opens a new road for the ` global ' analysis of experimental data within the perturbative gpd formalism to nlo accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the use of conformal symmetry enables elegant approach to higher - order radiative corrections to the dvcs amplitude .",
    "we have shown that although nlo corrections can be sizable , and are strongly dependent on the gluonic input , the nnlo corrections are small to moderate , supporting perturbative framework of dvcs .",
    "the observed change in the scale dependence is not so conclusive : similarly as in dis we encounter large nnlo effects for @xmath24 , which signal a breakdown of naive perturbation series expansion of the evolution operator . nevertheless , this breakdown is universal and if we precisely define the treatment of this operator , perturbative qcd can be employed as a tool for analyzing data even in the small @xmath25 region .",
    "we expect that within increasing accuracy in the perturbative approximation the gpd formalism improves .",
    "finally , fits to available dvcs and dis data in collider kinematics work well in the collinear factorization approach beyond lo and give access to transversal distribution of partons .",
    "the lesson learned from the failure of lo fits can be extended to ( oversimplified ) gpd models used for phenomenology in fixed target kinematics .",
    "they do not possess a flexible skewness dependence parameterization and so the normalization of the amplitude for fixed @xmath26 is mostly determined .",
    "ironically , this non - flexibility originates from the implementation of pdf and form factor constraints in the most convenient manner .",
    "this can be repaired in the mellin - barnes representation by a model dependent resummation of so(3 ) partial waves or in the momentum fraction representation by a more flexible double distribution ansatz , in which also the correlation of @xmath26- and skewness dependence is improved @xcite .    additionally , we have observed that the off - shell regge - exchange amplitudes@xcite , having the generic @xmath27-dependence of high - energy on - shell amplitudes , are ruled out . repairing this failure yields the well - known dilemma of regge - phenomenology .",
    "namely , when extended to off - shell processes it fails to describe high energy data and must be improved , thereby loosing its predictive power @xcite .",
    "this loss of predictive power appears also in description of deeply exclusive leptoproduction data in the valence quark region within regge inspired _ models _ , often outside of the accepted validity region @xmath28 in classical regge phenomenology , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "certainly , these approaches offer an easy and economical possibility to fit data and to interpret them in terms of mesonic exchanges and numerous couplings ( unknown form factors ) . in our opinion",
    "the gpd formalism offers a new perspective for our qcd understanding , including a handle on the dynamical sources of regge behavior . in this formalism one",
    "extracts information about non - perturbative quantities from experimental observables and interprets it in terms of partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "we consider regge - inspired interpretations of data @xcite as valuable tool for building realistic gpd models .",
    "this gives one handle more on the challenging task to understand hadron physics from qcd dynamics .",
    "non - perturbative gpd aspects , in particular regge behavior , might be studied within ( partial ) resummation of @xmath26-channel ladders ( in the language of light - cone wave functions of higher partonic fock states ) , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , lattice simulations , and model building .",
    "this might lead to clues to improved understanding of hadron physics in terms of the underlying theory .      for illuminating discussions on regge , bfkl , and collinear factorization approaches and their interplay as well as on gpd modelling we like to thank s.  brodsky , m.  diehl , b.  ermolaev , v.  fadin , d.  ivanov , l.l .",
