    "it was shown @xcite that those regions can be automatically detected by using the markov - clustering - algorithm ( mcl ) for network clusterization @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the evolution of random walkers on the network , resulting in a kinetically accurate network splitting .",

    "larger values of the parameter ( e.g. @xmath7 ) result in an increased number of clusters while the most relevant states ( i.e. separated by the highest barriers ) are already detected with @xmath8 between 1.2 and 1.4 @xcite .",

    "choosing @xmath15 , values of @xmath14 close to 1 suppress fluctuations while smaller values enhance them ( most of the treatment below was done for the case of large fluctuations with @xmath16 ) . this model was used to generate order parameter time series of @xmath17 steps .",
    "simulations of the ( gly - ser)@xmath18 flexible linker peptide were performed using the all - atom charmm force - field version 27 @xcite as implemented in the program acemd @xcite .",

    "this model served as a benchmark for the proposed network approach since the underlying kinetics is known by construction .",
    "the amount of fluctuations of the order parameter @xmath10 is controlled by a parameter @xmath14 ( see methods ) . to characterize the two - state behavior directly from the time series",
    "a _ naive _ strategy would take the distribution of @xmath10 , looking for the minimum separating the two states .",
    "the value of @xmath10 at the minimum , 0.5 in this case , defines the separator between the states .",
    "if the fluctuations around the separator are small , @xmath10 is a good order parameter in the sense that the number of crossings of the separator represents a good estimate of the barrier between the two states .",
    "this approach is valid for the case of small fluctuations but breaks down as soon as the overlap between the states increases ( i.e. large fluctuations ) . in the latter case",
    ", most of the contributions to the separator are coming from re - crossings : transitions passing the separator coming back very quickly to the initial state without reaching the end state .",
    "the origin of recrossings is mostly due to a sub - optimal choice of the order parameter rather than to a real physical property .",
    "the time series of @xmath10 for the case of large fluctuations ( @xmath16 ) was characterized with different approaches .",
    "a particular stringent test consists in the calculation of the first - passage - time ( fpt ) distribution to one of the two states .",
    "the correct distribution is shown as a dark blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b ( mean - fpt of 103.85 steps ) .",
    "this distribution is greatly influenced by the definition of the target state . if the latter is correctly defined , the resulting distribution overlap with the one calculated from the original two - state model .",
    "when the target state was chosen as @xmath21 , a fpt distribution calculated along the trajectory resulted in a much faster kinetics ( red line , fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b ) . with a mfpt of 7.56 steps , the kinetics obtained by this analysis was one order of magnitude faster with respect to the input model .",
    "a better description was obtained by analyzing the time series in terms of local - fluctuations and markov - state - models .",
    "the microstates were obtained by the protocol described in the theory section ( fig .",
    "[ fig : strategy ] ) .",
    "clusterization of the resulting transition network resulted in the detection of two states .",
    "being based on the order parameter fluctuations , these states are not strictly separated in terms of @xmath10 as shown by their time series ( light blue , fig .",
    "[ fig : model]a ) .",
    "these two states were used to build a new markov - state - model with transition probabilities estimated from the original transition network ( see methods ) . in this case , the fpt distribution was estimated by generating a new time series of @xmath22 steps from this model . strikingly , the fpt distribution calculated on this new trajectory perfectly overlapped to the one generated by the original two - state model as shown by the light blue line of fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b . using a time window @xmath23 ,",
    "the resulting mfpt is of about 114.58 steps , very close to the correct value of 103.85 .",
    "this is not the case when a two - state model was built by estimating the transition probability from the number of times the separator @xmath20 was crossed . as expected , the fpt distribution calculated on the time series generated by this model leads to very poor results because the inter - state separator is dominated by recrossings ( mfpt=5.2 , yellow line , fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b ) .",
    "it is important to note that the two kinetic models presented here ( corresponding to the light blue and yellow lines ) were built using the same starting information , i.e. the time series of the order parameter @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , the improvement obtained by the local - fluctuations analysis is purely due to the different strategy applied rather than the use of supplementary information .",
    "it is important to note that the predictions may depend on the choice of the time window @xmath5 ( see theory ) .",
    "caflisch and coworkers found a large range of validity for this parameter @xcite .",
    "for the present two - state model , the time window range was evaluated against the mfpt to reach the target state ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b ) . for small time",
    "windows the value of the mfpt was smaller with respect to the correct one ( horizontal line ) .",
    "this is due to the incorrect detection of states where large fluctuations were detected as real transitions . as the value of @xmath5",
    "was increased , the mfpt first converged to values close to the theoretical one ( @xmath24 ) and then increased again .",
    "it was found that when the time window was too large , some transitions were missed , resulting in a overall slower kinetics .",
    "consequently , the behavior of the mfpt as a function of @xmath5 suggests a reasonable way to choose the time window as the location of the first slope change ( @xmath23 , vertical line ) , just before the convergence region .",

    "[ fig : gsgs]b ) is shown in dark blue.,width=302 ]    glyser peptides have been used in experiments for quite some time as flexible linkers @xcite .",
    "short stretches of this peptide are interesting from a theoretical point of view because they are computationally tractable , presenting non - trivial conformational disorder @xcite . in this section",
    "the local - fluctuations analysis is applied to the dynamics of a ( gly - ser)@xmath18 peptide . to this aim , a long molecular dynamics simulation of 1 @xmath19s was performed .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the radius of gyration @xmath27 qualitatively describes the conformational disorder of this peptide , suggesting the presence of multiple states .",
    "a time series stretch and the distribution of the @xmath27 are shown as a dark blue line and a gray area in panel a and b of fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs ] , respectively .",
    "application of the local - fluctuations analysis on the @xmath27 time series revealed the presence of five major states ( @xmath28 ps and @xmath29 ; these two values were chosen following the mfpt based strategy of the previous section ) .",
    "[ fig : gsgs]b shows the @xmath27 distribution of the five states ( colored lines ) .",
    "interestingly , the five distributions are largely overlapping making their detection impossible by simply looking at the total distribution .",
    "in fact , the total distribution suggested no more than three states as indicated by the number of peaks ( gray are in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs]b ) .",
    "interestingly , the presence of the five states was already apparent in the raw @xmath27 time series ( dark blue line , fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs]a ) .",
    "those states became hidden in the total distribution due to the large fluctuations , reiterating the idea that using free - energy projections for the characterization of molecular processes can be ambiguous .    from a structural point of view , all five states are well characterized . a molecular representation of the three most compact states is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs]c . the most compact one , coded in light blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs]b , corresponds to a loop - like structure typically found in @xmath14-strands turns .",
    "this structure is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the first backbone oxygen o@xmath30 and nitrogen n@xmath31 .",
    "this conformation has a population of around 23% and @xmath32  .",
    "the second state has a population of 22% and @xmath33   ( green curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs]b ) .",
    "its topology is very similar to the turn - like structure but it is more disordered due to the formation of a non optimal backbone hydrogen bond .",
    "the third state instead is stabilized by the interaction of the side chain oxygen of ser@xmath18 with the backbone nitrogen n@xmath31 ( population of 20% and @xmath34  , yellow curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs]b ) . in this structure ,",
    "the side chain substitutes the backbone oxygen as a partner in the hydrogen bond , acting as a trap towards further compaction .",
    "finally , the last two states ( orange and red curves in fig .  [ fig : gsgs]b ) are rather unstructured , providing similar realizations of almost completely extended conformations .    to check whether the kinetics of the markov - state - model built on top of the five detected states reflected the same dynamics of the original trajectory , a fpt analysis was performed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs - fpt ] ) . in light blue ,",
    "the fpt distribution to the compact state was calculated on a trajectory originated from the markov - state - model . to compare it with the molecular dynamics simulation , the fpt to conformations with @xmath35 ( the top of the first peak in the @xmath27 distribution )",
    "was calculated along the original molecular dynamics trajectory ( dark blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs - fpt ] ) .",
    "this represents a good estimate of the fpt to the compact state at long times .",
    "strikingly , the two curves nicely overlapped .",
    "an exponential fit of the data , i.e. @xmath36 , showed a relaxation time of 6.5 ns in both cases .",
    "the fpt distribution calculated along the original trajectory using as target state all conformations with @xmath26 ( this is the value of the minimum of the @xmath27 distribution ) provided a much faster kinetics ( red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs - fpt ] ) .",
    "however , processes involving barrier crossings are expected to have the same relaxation kinetics when either the whole state is selected as a target or just the most probable conformation of the state ( i.e. conformations at the peak of the order parameter distribution ) @xcite .",
    "consequently , the disagreement between the fpt distribution to @xmath26 and to a more stringent target ( i.e. @xmath35 ) , provides strong evidence that the correct estimation of the kinetics can not be obtained directly from the @xmath27 distribution due to the presence of recrossings . as expected",
    ", this becomes even worse when the markov - state - model is built directly from the @xmath27 distribution , i.e. by choosing as states the portions of the distribution separated by minima and as transition probabilities the number of times the minima were crossed ( yellow line in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsgs - fpt ] ) .",
    "nowadays , molecular dynamics simulations easily produce tera scale of data . as such ,",
    "an important bottleneck in the understanding of molecular processes is in the analysis rather then the data generation per se .    in this work ,",
    "a strategy for the analysis of conventional order parameters time series that is kinetics compliant was investigated .",
    "our results provided strong evidence that the coupling of order parameter fluctuations with complex network analysis represents a powerful approach to deconvolute crowded order parameter distributions of molecular systems .",
    "this procedure allows the construction of kinetically accurate markov - state - models in a natural and intuitive way , largely overcoming the problems raised by conventional order parameter analysis .",
    "moreover , a wide range of experimentally generated time traces coming from fret or optical tweezers , can be readily tackled by this methodology .    taking into account the fluctuations within a time - window @xmath5 ,",
    "the approach is able to distinguish between snapshots belonging to different states but having the same value of the order parameter . towards an accurate characterization of the kinetics the value of @xmath5 needs to be chosen appropriately .",
    "we proposed to estimate it on the basis of a mean - first - passage - times analysis . very similar in spirit to what caflisch and collaborators proposed in their work @xcite , this procedure is more suitable to our network clusterization approach .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that instead of looking at better ways to analyze conventional order parameters time series , some groups focused their attention on the development of optimal reaction coordinates @xcite .",
    "these abstract coordinates aim to correctly characterize the molecular kinetics . among them , one method based on cut - based free - energy profiles seems very promising @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the coefficients of a linear combination of physical distances are optimized against the cut - based free - energy profile . at the end of the process",
    ", the combination which maximizes the barrier height with respect to a target state provides the optimal reaction coordinate .",
    "a fundamental difference between this method and the local - fluctuations analysis is that the latter requires the time evolution of a single ( non - optimal ) coordinate while the optimization procedure makes use of a very large number of physical distances ( usually around thousands @xcite ) to perform properly .",
