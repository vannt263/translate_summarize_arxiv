    "heterogeneous wireless networks integrate multiple radios with different capabilities , protocol stacks , and spectrum allocations .",
    "the flexibility of these different radios allows for more general dynamic resource allocation , better coverage , and higher capacity . in heterogeneous networks",
    ", users can be connected to transmitters via parallel channels operating over different networks , such as a cellular and a wifi network ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ltewifi ] ) . in this work",
    "we investigate how to optimally communicate over such parallel channels .",
    "we begin with the following setup .",
    "a transmitter is connected to two receivers through two parallel channels : the first channel is a multiple - input single - output  ( miso ) bc and the second channel is a noiseless rate - limited multicast channel . in a typical realization of our model , the miso bc ( tx  1 ) can be the cellular downlink from the base station to the mobile users who are also in close proximity to the access point  ( ap ) of a wifi network ( tx  2 ) or a femtocell base station operating over a different frequency ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ltewifi ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "the base station can therefore transmit to the two users over the cellular downlink while at the same time establish a second multicast channel through the ip network or the femtocell base station .",
    "alternatively , one can think of the transmitter and the two users as connected by two parallel broadcast channels , a miso bc operating over one frequency , and a siso bc operating over another ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ltewifi]-(b ) ) .",
    "a common and perhaps the simplest way to use the two channels is by _ channel aggregation_. that is , the transmitter sends independent information over the two channels and the total throughput becomes the sum of the individual throughputs of the two channels .",
    "this approach typically assumes perfect channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) .",
    "however , it is well known that the capacity of the gaussian multi - antenna bc is very sensitive to the availability of the csit .",
    "specifically , in the high snr regime , the degrees of freedom  ( dof ) of the two - user miso bc are @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 for the cases with instantaneous ( perfect ) csit  @xcite , completely outdated csit ( i.e. , the csit is available only after the channel s coherence period )  @xcite , and no csit  @xcite , respectively . therefore , given that the first channel is a miso bc , it is obvious that channel aggregation will suffer a dof loss when csit is imperfect .        in this work ,",
    "we propose a simple scheme that strictly outperforms the aforementioned channel aggregation scheme .",
    "we show a somewhat surprising result that , with our scheme , completely outdated csit can achieve the same dof performance as with instantaneous csit , provided that the rate of the parallel multicast channel is high enough . for instance , the proposed scheme can attain a total dof of @xmath4 with completely outdated csit when the dof of the parallel multicast channel  @xmath5 is larger than @xmath1 .",
    "this is as if the miso bc could provide a sum dof of @xmath1 , which is only possible when instantaneous csit is available without the parallel multicast channel .",
    "the main idea of our optimal scheme ( termed a two - phase overload - multicast strategy ) is simply to _ transmit overload _ the miso bc , i.e , transmit symbols at a rate larger than the multiplexing gain supported by the miso bc , and then use the multicast channel to _ multicast _ additional information to enable reliable decoding . in particular , the additional information sent from the multicast channel is such that it is beneficial for both users but potentially in different ways , e.g. , it can be used by one user to cancel the created interference and simultaneously used by the other user as an extra observation for decoding .",
    "based on this optimal strategy , we characterize the optimal dof region for a two - user multiple - input multiple - output  ( mimo ) bc with a parallel multicast channel . achieving each corner point in the dof region",
    "involves a careful tuning of the overload and multicast phases of this strategy as well as combining it with zero - forcing and single user transmission .",
    "the region is obtained as a function of the multicast channel capacity and the csit timeliness for the mimo bc .",
    "our result reveals an interesting tradeoff between these two parameters .",
    "namely , with timely  ( e.g. , almost instantaneous ) csit a small multicast channel capacity is enough to guarantee the maximal sum dof achievable with instantaneous csit , while with completely outdated csit a large multicast channel capacity is required to compensate for the sum dof loss due to the csit staleness . in other words , for a given delay of the csit we can determine the amount of multicast channel capacity needed to achieve the same performance as with instantaneous csit ; or equivalently , for a given capacity of the multicast channel we can determine the maximal delay we can tolerate in acquiring the csit without sacrificing performance .",
    "interestingly , this same two - phase overload multicast strategy can be extended to the @xmath0-user mimo bc with a parallel multicast channel ( in the regime when the number of transmit antennas is larger than the total number of receive antennas in the mimo bc ) , and can again achieve the instantaneous csit performance ( optimal sum dof ) with completely outdated csit , provided that the rate of the multicast channel to each user is high enough .",
    "when @xmath0 is large , the sum dof gain of the proposed strategy over simple channel aggregation is proportional to the total number of receive antennas . when the capacity of the multicast channel is small , we develop another joint coding strategy which is sum dof optimal .",
    "the fact that completely stale csit can be useful in achieving higher dof over the @xmath0-user miso bc was first revealed by the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "this work showed the surprising result that completely outdated csit achieves a sum dof performance that surpasses the no - csit performance . with @xmath0-users ,",
    "their scheme is composed of @xmath0 phases where in the @xmath6th phase the transmitter sends so - called @xmath6-order symbols intended for a group of @xmath6 users , for @xmath7 .",
    "our strategy for the regime where the capacity of the multicast channel is small builds on a similar idea .",
    "the mimo bc transmitter transmits @xmath6-order symbols in phase @xmath6 for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , is determined by the available multicasting capacity .",
    "the transmission of higher order symbols is then delegated to the multicast channel . however , this strategy turns out to be suboptimal in the regime where the multicasting capacity is large .",
    "the two - phase overload - multicast strategy that we propose for this case and show to be optimal is strictly different and surprisingly simple .",
    "it is composed of only two phases , overload and multicast , with the amount of overloading determined by the number of users and the number of transmit and receive antennas .",
    "following @xcite , the impact of delayed or completely outdated csit on the achievable dof in wireless networks has been studied extensively in the literature ( see @xcite and also the references therein ) . in all of these works ,",
    "the performance with _ delayed _ csit turns out to be inferior to the instantaneous csit performance with the exception of @xcite .",
    "this work shows that delayed ( but _ not completely outdated _ ) csit , with delay less than a @xmath11 fraction of the channel coherence time , achieves the same sum dof as with instantaneous csit in the miso bc setting with @xmath12 transmit antennas and @xmath13 users . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "whenever there is a dof performance gap between the cases with instantaneous csit and no csit , the performance with _ completely outdated _ csit is always inferior to the instantaneous csit performance in all of the previous settings considered in the literature ( including that of @xcite ) .",
    "we believe our work demonstrates the first setting where _ completely outdated _ csit feedback achieves the same sum dof as with instantaneous csit .",
    "our work also reveals the value of joint encoding over heterogeneous parallel channels .",
    "while parallel channels have been studied extensively in the literature @xcite , they usually refer to the realizations of the same physical channel over different time / frequency slots .",
    "the parallel channels that emerge in heterogeneous networks which we consider here significantly differ from these earlier models in that the two parallel channels are completely different from each other in nature . while it is known that parallel gaussian broadcast channels are separable both with single @xcite and multiple antennas @xcite , i.e. the capacity is achieved by using a separate optimized code for each of the channels and then summing up the resultant per - channel capacity , our result reveals that heterogeneous parallel broadcast channels are not always separable ( even in the dof sense ) .",
