    "recent developments in ultra - cold atom physics allow for studies of a wide range of many - body quantum systems of bosons , fermions and their mixtures , involving strong correlations and/or frustration .",
    "one of the remarkable recent advances is the so - called artificial gauge fields ,  @xcite which allow one to generate spin - orbit couplings and magnetic fields , opening the way for example to quantum hall and spin hall effects .",
    "these effects are also related to studies on topological phases of matters .",
    "in addition , the control of interactions between atoms by the feshbach resonance technique allows for the controlled study of quantum systems under the combined effects of an artificial gauge field and strong correlations .",
    "the key to artificial gauge fields is berry s phases  @xcite tuned by atom - light interactions ,  @xcite in which atoms acquire a geometric phase in their motion because of an adiabatic spatial change of the dressed states . using raman transitions based on these ideas ,",
    "the synthesis of an effective magnetic field  @xcite and spin - orbit coupling  @xcite have been experimentally achieved in bose condensates of @xmath1rb atoms , and the spin - hall effect in bose condensates has been also successfully observed  @xcite .",
    "the realization of artificial gauge fields in optical lattice potentials has also been intensively discussed .",
    "the pioneering theory making use of photo - assisted tunneling techniques has been established by jaksch and zoller  @xcite .",
    "subsequently other schemes for effective uniform magnetic fields  @xcite and for staggered magnetic fields  @xcite have also been proposed . in experiments ,",
    "several types of artificial magnetic fields using photo - assisted tunneling have been subsequently realized in recent years : effective magnetic fluxes inhomogeneously set in stripes  @xcite , uniform magnetic fluxes  @xcite , and spin - orbit couplings without spin flips  @xcite in two - dimensional optical lattice systems .",
    "in addition to the above realizations , other schemes for artificial gauge fields have been invented using zeeman lattice techniques  @xcite and shaking of optical lattice potentials  @xcite .",
    "optical lattices also allow for the control of dimensionality , so that one - dimensional quantum systems can be realized .",
    "a quasi - one - dimensional `` ladder '' geometry plays the role of a minimal model for studying the effect of gauge fields . in these low - dimensional systems ,",
    "the whole range of interaction strengths from weak to strong coupling can be investigated using powerful numerical and analytic techniques , such as bosonization and the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "because of the peculiar critical nature of tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquids which describe their low - energy properties , such quasi - one - dimensional quantum systems subject to artificial gauge fields or high magnetic fields are expected to display interesting phenomena . in studies on ladder systems subjected to magnetic fields ,",
    "fermion systems have been discussed in the context of strongly correlated electron systems  @xcite .",
    "the study of bosonic ladders subject to magnetic fields has also been motivated by the josephson junction ladders and ultra - cold bose atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "in addition to common features of bose - hubbard models such as a one - dimensional superfluid ( sf ) , mott insulator ( mi ) , and phase transition between them , the bosonic ladders exhibit interesting phenomena induced by the magnetic field : chiral superfluid phases ( csf ) and chiral mott insulating phases ( cmi ) displaying meissner currents  @xcite .",
    "attention to the topic of bosonic ladders subject to an artificial magnetic field has been reinforced recently by the first experimental realization of such a system .",
    "@xcite    in this article , we study the low - energy physics of bose - hubbard ladders subject to an artificial uniform magnetic flux , from the viewpoint of field theory .",
    "so far , field theoretical approaches to bosonic ladder systems have usually considered starting with the strong coupling limit , in which the rung hopping is treated perturbatively  @xcite in contrast , we derive an effective field theory from a weak coupling perspective , in which the effect of a rung hopping is fully taken into account , and the interaction is included perturbatively . in this approach , typical strong correlation phenomena such as the mi state and the mi - sf phase transition can nonetheless be investigated , by taking into account backscattering and umklapp scattering processes .",
    "the low - energy effective field theories in the two cases of a large and small magnetic flux are separately derived , for an arbitrary filling .",
    "in addition we also apply the constructed effective field theory and investigate the ground - state phase diagram in two limiting cases , namely that of a large magnetic flux equal to @xmath0 per plaquette , and that of a small magnetic flux , with one particle per site . for the @xmath0 magnetic flux",
    ", we compare our phase diagram to the one previously obtained numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite , and all the phases found there are well described by our approach .",
    "furthermore , more importantly , the presence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram is predicted by the analysis presented here , which has not been emphasized previously . in the limit of a small magnetic flux ,",
    "we show that a sf state with meissner current appears , and transits to the mi state for strong interactions .",
    "in addition we also find that the meissner current can survive also in the mi state while the system is fully gapped .",
    "a similar fully gapped charge - ordered state with meissner currents has also been found for the different filling of one particle per two sites by petrescu and le hur  @xcite .",

    "one is the switch of the locked field in the antisymmetric sector , from @xmath164 to @xmath182 , and the other is the change of the locking value of the symmetric field @xmath177 . in addition , the two - fold degeneracy caused by the fixed @xmath164 in the cmi phase is found to change to a non - degenerate state in the mi phase .",
