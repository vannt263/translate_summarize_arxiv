    "planets outside the solar system have been detected since 1992 @xcite from the doppler shift of spectral features in emission from the star , which determines the orbital period and places a constraint on the mass of the planet @xcite . since 1999 , the presence of exoplanets has also been deduced from their transit across the face of the parent star @xcite .",
    "the fraction of light blocked by the planet allows the radius of the planet to be deduced as a function of the radius of the star @xcite .",
    "subsequently , several hundred exoplanets have been detected at different distances from their stars , and the precision with which mass and radius have been deduced has increased for some exoplanets to better than 10%  in both mass and radius @xcite .    in 2001 , light from an exoplanet was detected directly @xcite , opening the window to studies of exoplanet structure through the composition and temperature of the surface or atmosphere .",
    "however , inferences about the composition and structure rely on the comparison of mass and radius with planets within the solar system . with the exception of earth , which is currently the only planet for which seismic data exist , interpretations of the internal structure of the planets",
    "rely in turn on assumptions about the composition and temperature profiles through the planet",
    ".    theories of planetary formation can be investigated by comparing the structure of exoplanets with those within the solar system .",
    "another motivation is to estimate the occurrence of earth - like planets , in terms of mass and composition , and also those that might be habitable for life .",
    "deductions about planetary structures , i.e. the composition profile , depend on the compressibility of the possible compositions thought to occur .",
    "the compressibility is needed over the range of pressures and temperatures occurring within each planet .",
    "the compressibility is found from the derivative of the pressure - density relation at the appropriate temperature , which can be determined from the equation of state ( eos ) for the particular composition of matter of interest .",
    "the development of eos has been driven most by research in weapons ( explosives and projectile impacts ) ( for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , geophysics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and inertial confinement fusion @xcite .",
    "there is a perception that experimental and theoretical methods for determining eos are not available in regimes necessary to understand the internal structure of planets for pressures between 200gpa and 10tpa , i.e. from the limit of diamond anvil data to the onset of the thomas - fermi - dirac ( tfd ) regime @xcite . some studies ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) have considered sub - tfd eos with care , but it is common practice even when accurate theoretical calculations are available to represent the material with _ ad hoc _ functional forms , potentially leading to problems when extrapolating beyond the bounds of the constraining data and in switching over to tfd at high pressures .",
    "although there is a definite need for more theoretical and experimental studies , appropriate theoretical techniques are just as accurate above 200gpa as below , and are more than adequate to draw inferences about the structure of exoplanets ; moreover , shock and ramp loading experiments can readily explore states up to @xmath35tpa and are suitable to test and calibrate eos . in this paper",
    ", we study the validity of electronic structure methods for predicting eos up to the @xmath4tpa pressures apparently occurring in exoplanets , and the capability of dynamic loading experiments to measure relevant states .",
    "we calculate mass - radius relations for several compositions of matter representing different classes of , and layers in , planets , discussing the validity of the eos used .",
    "finally , we compare the mass - radius relations with representative planets and exoplanets .",
    "the quasistatic structure of self - gravitating bodies depends on the scalar eos , which can be described by an appropriate free energy expressed as a function of its natural variables , such as the helmholtz free energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is mass density and @xmath7 temperature . in principle",
    ", one could consider the composition as a set of explicit parameters in the eos . in practice ,",
    "planetary structures are thought to comprise layers in each of which a single composition , or range of compositions , dominates the eos , such as fe in the core of rocky planets .",
    "therefore , we consider a separate eos for each layer .    as with dynamic loading situations ,",
    "the pressure @xmath8 is the most directly useful aspect of the eos for calculating and interpreting planetary structures .",
    "almost invariably , a thermodynamically incomplete eos is used : @xmath9 or @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the specific internal energy .",
    "planetary structures may be constrained to follow a specified temperature profile , in which @xmath9 is the more convenient form , or an isentrope , for which @xmath10 is convenient since @xmath12 where @xmath13 .    in planets , brown dwarfs , and main sequence stars ,",
    "the eos is dominated by electrostatic forces and pauli exclusion among the electrons and ions , rather than by strong - force interactions between the nuclei . in stars , the radiation pressure",
    "must be included , and the entropy is much higher , exploring a different region of the eos .      in this section ,",
    "we describe key theoretical methods and approximations used when predicting eos , and comment on their applicability to states likely to occur in exoplanets .",
    "the relevant eos of matter can be calculated using electronic structure theory .",
    "for a representative set of atoms defining the composition , thermodynamic potentials can be calculated as a function of @xmath6 ( i.e. system volume ) and @xmath7 . because the mass of the electrons is so much less than that of the nuclei ,",
    "the state of the electrons can generally be considered with respect to the instantaneous positions of the nuclei  the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "forces on the nuclei can also be calculated with respect to their positions and the distribution of electrons .",
    "the energy of the system can be thought of as comprising the ground state energy for stationary ions , thermal motion of the ions , and thermal excitation of the electrons out of their ground state . in principle , all contributions should be calculated self - consistently . however , for eos , it is generally a good approximation to partition the free energy into the cold compression curve , thermal motion of the ions , and thermal excitation of the electrons , @xmath14 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "to describe the material state and the dynamics of most atoms , the quantum nature of the nuclei can be ignored , allowing their treatment as point - like masses exhibiting newtonian dynamics .",
    "the exception is h , for which the quantum behavior of the proton can be represented as a correction to the potential experienced by the electrons .",
    "the motion of the nuclei can be calculated with respect to time .",
    "this technique , known as first - principles molecular dynamics ( fpmd ) or quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite , is particularly appropriate for fluids , unknown or ill - defined crystal structures , and multi - species compositions of matter where it is not clear _ a priori _ where particular species will be located .",
    "in addition to the eos , fpmd has been used to predict transport properties , including the electric and thermal conductivities @xcite and viscosity @xcite , which are important in understanding the formation and thermal profile of planets as well as the generation of their magnetic fields .",
    "fpmd has also been used in studies of the free energy profiles of mixtures to determine possible miscibility gaps which could have a large impact on planetary evolution and structure @xcite .    for crystalline structures ,",
    "the motion of the nuclei can be calculated in terms of oscillations about their equilibrium positions , i.e. phonon modes . in principle , phonon modes should be calculated self - consistently with electron excitations ; in practice , for most conditions encountered in planets , the ion - thermal motion can be calculated from the phonon density of states at @xmath15 , and the electron - thermal contribution can often be ignored .",
    "@xmath16 comprises the ground state energy of the system as a function of compression , @xmath17 , and any configurational entropy that may be associated with different structural polymorphs or the entropy of mixing in an impure system @xcite .",
    "one may calculate @xmath18 by setting up a configuration of nuclei , and finding the ground state of the hamiltonian of the electrons .",
    "the configuration of the nuclei may be altered or relaxed under the net force they experience to find the lowest - energy structure , but they are often held fixed in likely structures . for well - defined crystalline structures , phonon modes can be predicted by calculating the electrostatic forces on the nuclei as each is displaced from equilibrium .",
    "explicit calculation of the phonons is desirable below the debye temperature , where the zero - point motion of the nuclei and the freezing out of modes may have a significant effect on the eos @xcite .",
    "thermal excitation of the electrons can be calculated from the band structure , which is the set of eigenstates of the electronic hamiltonian . for sufficiently high temperatures ,",
    "the eigenstates must be calculated self - consistently with their population , but accurate calculations can be made to @xmath3ev temperatures using the @xmath15 band structure .    the key physics , and thus the source of limitations in the accuracy and validity of the eos , is the electronic structure calculation .",
    "the challenge is in representing the multi - fermion nature of the electrons accurately , but with a method that is computationally tractable for real materials .",
    "path integral methods , such as path - integral monte - carlo ( pimc ) , can be used for direct , rigorous calculations of multi - particle states @xcite . however",
    ", these methods are practicable mostly for low-@xmath19 materials , and have not been applied systematically ( or , generally , at all ) to compositions of matter relevant to ice and rocky planets .",
    "there is , however , no reason to suspect that these techniques are unsuitable under exoplanet conditions _ per se_.",
    "although tfd - based electronic structure theory @xcite is often regarded as an adequate treatment for pressures over @xmath310tpa ( for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it does not capture the effects of electronic shell structure which are expected at high pressures @xcite .",
    "however , shell effects such as pressure ionization are captured by the electronic structure techniques considered here .",
    "most theoretical eos calculations use density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and its variants to treat exchange and correlation between the electrons via functionals of the electron density , calibrated to reproduce the same system energy as techniques that treat the electron wavefunctions more directly .",
    "dft functionals are calibrated against calculations of idealized electron gases , which may be performed up to arbitrarily high densities : they should be no less accurate for the relatively modest absolute compressions occurring in the cores of exoplanets than at @xmath20 .",
    "dft calculations typically reproduce the observed mass density to within a few percent ( for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is an observable discrepancy when compared with dynamic or quasistatic loading measurements .",
    "calculations can be corrected by adjusting the energy to reproduce the mass density at zero pressure , which is most accurately measured .",
    "the resulting eos  which we have termed ` ab fere initio ' to distinguish them from uncorrected ab initio eos  then typically reproduce high pressure measurements to within their uncertainties @xcite .    in many situations ,",
    "electrons closer to the nuclei are not affected by changes in the compression or temperature , and the states of the other electrons may be calculated more efficiently by subsuming the inner electrons into a modified nuclear potential : the pseudopotential method @xcite .",
    "pseudopotential calculations can become inaccurate when the nuclei are compressed sufficiently closely together .",
    "the validity can be checked by comparing against all - electron calculations , and may be accurate to severalfold compressions or pressures of terapascals @xcite .    with these caveats , pseudopotential techniques and the dft",
    "construct in general are not inherently unsuitable for predicting eos in the planetary structure regime .",
    "however , detailed calculations of many - species compounds are computationally expensive , and predictions of polymorphic structures are sensitive to relatively small inaccuracies in the computational methods .",
    "it is highly desirable to compare eos predictions against experimental measurements .    for the most part",
    ", we have used previously - developed eos based on experimental data or validated electronic structure calculations up to the limit of available data , and blending into tfd predictions at high compressions @xcite .",
    "these eos incorporate thermal effects , allowing us to investigate the sensitivity of planetary structures to temperature profile .",
    "for fe and fe - ni , we have compared predictions from such eos with 3d electronic structure calculations extended to higher pressures than have been reported previously .",
    "previous theoretical studies include very careful treatments of the eos of fe up to pressures and temperatures representative of the earth s core ( in particular * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and it is very desirable to perform equivalent studies to higher pressures and temperatures necessary for the study of exoplanets . for our present purposes ,",
    "it is most useful to compare eos for different compositions of matter constructed according to consistent prescriptions .",
    "the use of wide - ranging eos constructed using optimized algorithms , and wide - ranging sets of electronic structure calculations made using a consistent method that reproduces tfd at extreme compressions , allows us to avoid any reliance on extrapolating using _",
    "ad hoc _ functional forms such as vinet and birch - murnaghan for pressure - density relations , which can give unquantified uncertainties outside the range of the fitting data .",
    "the canonical experimental technique for studying the properties at matter at high pressure is shock loading , using a variety of methods to induce a shock wave .",
    "shock measurements of eos are often performed relative to a reference material , but an attraction of shock loading is that experiments can in principle be configured to yield absolute measurements , if the shock is induced by the impact of a projectile with a target of the same material .",
    "indeed , the pressure standards in static compression apparatus such as diamond anvil cells are ultimately calibrated against absolute shock measurements .",
    "although the time scales in dynamic loading experiments are typically nanoseconds to microseconds , typical equilibration times for electrons and atomic vibrations are much shorter , so inferred states used for testing and calibrating eos are in thermodynamic equilibrium and thus equivalent to quasistatic compression measurements made in presses such as diamond anvil cells .",
    "indeed , the difference in time scale between dynamic and quasistatic loading is less than the difference between the latter and planetary ages .",
    "although eos measurements are in thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to a given phase of matter , the time dependence of phase transitions must be considered : phase changes often occur with a significant degree of superpressurization or superheating in dynamic loading experiments and indeed in quasistatic loading , compared with the equilibrium phase boundary .",
    "the effects of time dependence are also evident as hysteresis in the location of the phase change on loading compared with unloading .",
    "in shock loading , the entropy increases with compression , so the temperature rises faster with compression than it does along an isentrope .",
    "the grneisen parameter and heat capacity of a material , which may be estimated theoretically or experimentally , can be used to predict the eos away from the locus of shock states .",
    "measurements along the principal shock hugoniot have been used in this way for many years to estimate the principal isentrope and the cold curve @xcite . while a direct measurement of a relevant state is preferable , shock - derived eos are likely to be adequate for exoplanets over a wide range of pressures . furthermore ,",
    "if a theoretical eos is validated by shock experiments , this provides reasonable confidence that the eos is valid at lower temperatures .",
    "a more serious limitation with shock experiments is that , for a given material and starting state , there is a limit to the compression that can be achieved by the passage of a single shock , and therefore a limit to the range of compressions that can be deduced along isentropes .",
    "however , this compression ( discussed further below for different compositions of matter ) is adequate to explore matter into the massive exoplanet regime .",
    "shock measurements have been made to pressures of up to 10tpa using radiation from underground nuclear explosions @xcite .",
    "the compression limit can be circumvented through the use of multiple shocks , which induce lower temperatures than a single shock to the same pressure . the ultimate limit for an infinite sequence of infinitesimal shocks",
    "is a ramp compression .",
    "ramp compression of condensed matter was first demonstrated using the expanding reaction products from a chemical explosive @xcite , and has subsequently been demonstrated using pulsed magnetic fields at the z accelerator @xcite and high power lasers . with lasers ,",
    "the pulse energy may be used to vaporize a foil which then loads the sample in an analogous way to the chemical reaction products @xcite , the pulse may ablate the sample directly with an intensity history designed to induce a ramp in pressure @xcite , or the sample may be driven from a hohlraum with a power history chosen to control the hohlraum temperature history such that a ramp is induced .",
    "ramp loading using the last variant has been demonstrated to @xmath31tpa on the omega laser @xcite , with near - term experiments on fe planned to reach 2tpa at the national ignition facility ( nif ) .",
    "experimental techniques have thus been available to develop and test eos under conditions relevant to exoplanets , and planned developments should provide the first direct measurements of matter under exoplanet core conditions .",
    "if the rotation rate is not extreme , self - gravitating bodies are close to spherical .",
    "spherical structures are certainly an adequate starting place for studies of exoplanets .",
    "the condition for isostatic equilibrium is that the stress induced by pressure variations is balanced by the gravitational acceleration @xmath21 : @xmath22 for newtonian gravitation , by gauss theorem , @xmath21 can be expressed in terms of the mass enclosed within a given radius @xmath23 : @xmath24 so @xmath25 @xmath23 can be calculated simply from the distribution of mass density , @xmath26 or @xmath27    when the total mass @xmath28 , outer radius @xmath29 , and surface composition are known with reasonable confidence , and the objective is to determine an aspect of the internal structure such as the core radius , the equations can be integrated from the surface inward , starting at the known @xmath30 ( hence @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the internal structure parameter is found as the solution of a shooting problem to ensure that @xmath33 as @xmath34 . to calculate generic mass - radius relations for a uniform composition",
    ", it is most efficient to start at the center , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , choose the core pressure @xmath37 , and integrate outward until @xmath20 . in this way",
    ", the mass - radius condition is obtained in terms of @xmath38 as an independent parameter : @xmath39 .",
    "these solution methods are unwieldy when it is desired to constrain the overall composition as a mixture of components , such as a fixed ratio between fe , rock , and h / he . in this case",
    ", the isostatic structure may be found more conveniently by starting with the desired masses of each component , and solving the system of equations as an elliptic problem .",
    "a numerical solution may be found iteratively by taking an approximate solution ( which may initially be concentric shells of material at their @xmath20 density ) and improving it by calculating the net stress gradient at each radius @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( ignoring the relatively slow change of @xmath42 with deformation , which is valid near equilibrium ) , and hence estimating a change in radius for each shell such that the net pressure is zero .",
    "the radial variation was represented discretely by values at a finite series of radii .",
    "multiple iterations are necessary to allow the effect of a net pressure at some radius to be balanced through equilibration of the whole structure , but standard techniques may be used for solving elliptic equations efficiently , such as successive over - relaxation @xcite .",
    "a series of solutions describing a mass - radius relation can be found efficiently by working upward in mass , and increasing the density at each radius by a constant factor , then calculating the modified equilibrium structure .",
    "we verified that this method of solution gave the same result as integration from the center to the surface , by comparison with structures comprising pure fe .    to close the system of equations , a @xmath43 relation is needed for the material .",
    "the choice of @xmath43 relation implies a choice for the entropy or temperature profile of the body . in the present study we usually chose an isentrope passing through a reasonable surface state , such as stp for rock or metal , or a few atmospheres pressure and cryogenic temperatures for compositions that are gaseous at stp .",
    "isentropes were calculated by numerical integration of the relation @xmath44 using a procedure valid for eos of arbitrary form @xcite . for a few sample compositions ,",
    "structures were calculated for @xmath43 along the cold curve .",
    "the precision of @xmath43 curves necessary to be useful for exoplanet structures is lower than for solar system planets , and the difference in structures between the stp isentrope and cold curve was found to be negligible over the range of pressures considered , as shown below .",
    "mass - radius relations were calculated for a series of compositions of matter relevant to ( exo)planets , using as a baseline eos developed from and for shock wave applications , in particular the sesame library @xcite , for which the constituent assumptions and calibrations are reasonably well documented .",
    "sesame eos are tabulated functions @xmath45 .",
    "most sesame eos are tabulated over a wide enough range of states to be valid ( at least in principle , to some finite precision ) for massive exoplanets and star formation .",
    "they were constructed to incorporate experimental data , mainly shock measurements , where available .",
    "experimental measurements not used in the construction of the eos , including shock states , release from shock , and ramp compression , are frequently compared against the sesame eos , so there is a relatively rich literature on experimental validation .",
    "many of the eos were constructed using the same theoretical and modeling approaches , so conclusions drawn from the use of one eos are more likely to apply to other materials .",
    "when these eos are compared with subsequent shock or ramp measurements at higher pressures , it is quite usual to find significant differences , i.e. inaccuracies in the eos , but they are usually at the level of a few times the experimental uncertainty ( for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would not have much effect on the mass - radius relation .    for all undifferentiated compositions",
    ", the low - mass limit behaves as @xmath46 and deviates as matter within the planet is compressed gravitationally above its zero - pressure density @xmath47 .",
    "the deviations become substantial as the central pressure approaches the bulk modulus . as the mass increases further",
    ", an increasing proportion is compressed to significantly higher density , until eventually any increase in mass is accommodated entirely by density increase , leading to a maximum in radius .      for fe , which is the dominant component of interest at the highest pressures",
    ", we are developing eos better optimized to exoplanet core states , to complement nif experiments @xcite .",
    "thermodynamically complete versions of these eos were not available for this study : only the cold curves .",

    "a pure hydrogen planet of the nominal mass would have a radius of 1.12mj and a central pressure of 214tpa .",
    "the actual proportion of rock that would be consistent with the observed mass and radius is difficult to estimate using the available eos , because they roll over at lower masses ; future studies will include theoretical prediction and experimental investigation of the eos under relevant conditions .",

    "a plausible explanation is that this planet is young and hot , from accretion , tidal heating , or internal processes .",
    "the radius would be larger for a warmer isentrope , but is relatively insensitive to temperature .",
    "another potential source of uncertainty , particularly for warm bodies with a significant proportion of volatiles , is the sensitivity to definition of the outer surface of the body .",

    "the radius was more sensitive to small proportions of rock than has been concluded previously .",
    "these results support the conclusion that corot-7b , with measurements analyzed by @xcite , is ` earth - like ' in that it is likely to have a rocky layer over an fe - ni core , though the present uncertainty in the exoplanet s mass is too large to constrain the mass of fe significantly : there may be very little .",
    "gj  1214b lies between the curves for h@xmath0o and ch@xmath1 , which are compositions where improvements to the eos are particularly desirable . the composition can not be constrained meaningfully from present data , and suggestions that it might be an ` ocean planet ' are speculative .",
    "the present results also support the conclusion that hat - p-2b is a gas giant , though the density is proportionately larger than the gas giants in the solar system , indicating a higher proportion of matter of higher atomic number .",
    "the mass - radius relations imply core pressures of @xmath71tpa for corot-7b , a range range 0.5 - 1.5tpa for gj  1214b , over 210tpa in hat - p-2b , and around 1900tpa in corot-3b .",
