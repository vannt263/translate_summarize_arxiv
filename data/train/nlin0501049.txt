    "understanding the mechanism of turbulence has been a great challenge for over a century .",
    "now , it is still very far from approaching a comprehensive theory and the final resolution of the turbulent problem @xcite .",
    "reynolds ( 1883)[1 ] @xcite did the first famous experiments on pipe flow demonstrating the transition from laminar to turbulent flows . since then , various stability theories emerged during the past 120 years for this phenomenon , but few are satisfactory in the explanation of the various flow instabilities and the related complex flow phenomena .",
    "the pipe poiseuille flow ( hagen - poiseuille ) is linearly stable for all the reynolds number @xmath4 by eigenvalue analysis @xcite @xcite schmid01 @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , experiments showed that the flow would become turbulence if @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) exceeds a value of @xmath6 .",
    "experiments also showed that disturbances in a laminar flow could be carefully avoided or considerably reduced , the onset of turbulence was delayed to reynolds numbers up to @xmath7 @xcite gross00 . for @xmath4 above @xmath6 ,",
    "the characteristic of turbulence transition depends on the disturbance amplitude and frequency , below which transition from laminar to turbulent state does not occur regardless of the initial disturbance amplitude @xcite @xcite .",
    "thus , it is clear that the transition from laminar to turbulence for @xmath8 is dominated by the behaviours of mean flow and disturbance .",
    "only the combined effect of the two factors reaches the critical condition , could the transition occur for @xmath8 .",
    "these are summarized in table 1 .",
    "linear stability analysis of plane parallel flows gives critical reynolds number @xmath4 ( @xmath9 ) of @xmath10 for plane poiseuille flow , while experiments show that transition to turbulence occurs at reynolds number of order @xmath11 @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , even though the laminar flow could also kept to @xmath7 nishioak75 .",
    "one resolution of these paradoxes is that the domain of attraction for the laminar state shrinks for large re ( as @xmath12 say , with @xmath13 so that small but finite perturbations lead to transition @xcite @xcite .",
    "grossmann @xcite commented that this discrepancy demonstrates that nature of the onset - of - turbulence mechanism in this flow must be different from an eigenvalue instability .",
    "orszag and patera @xcite remarked that the mechanism of transition is not properly represented by parallel - flow linear stability analysis .",
    "they proposed a linear three - dimensional mechanism to predict the transitional reynolds number .",
    "some nonlinear stability theories have been proposed , for example , in @xcite . however",
    ", these theories do not seem to offer a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "energy method was also used in the study of flow instabilities lincc1955 @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite schmid01 . in energy method",
    ", one observes the rate of increasing of disturbance energy to study the instability of the _ flow system_. the critical condition is determined by the maximum reynolds number at which the disturbance energy in the system monotonically decreases . in the flow system , it is considered that turbulence shear stress interacts with the velocity gradient  and the disturbance gets energy from mean flow in such a way .",
    "thus , the disturbance is amplified and the instability occurs with the energy increasing of disturbance .",
    "therefore , it is recognized that it is the basic state vorticity leading to instability .",
    "the energy method could not get agreement with the experiments either @xcite @xcite schmid01 . in recent years , various transition scenarios",
    "have been proposed @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite zikanov @xcite @xcite @xcite for the subcritical transition .",
    "although we can get a better understanding of the transition process from these scenarios , the mechanism is still not fully understood and the agreement with the experimental data is still not satisfied .    generally , the transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow is not generated suddenly in the entire flow field but it first starts from somewhere in the flow field and then spreads out gradually from this position . as is well known in solid mechanics , the damage of a metal component generally starts from some area such as manufacturing fault , crack , stress concentration , or fatigue position , etc . in fluid mechanics ,",
    "we consider that the breaking down of a steady laminar flow should also start from a most dangerous position first .",
    "the consequent questions are : ( a ) _ where is this most dangerous position for poiseuille flow ? _ ( b ) _ what is the mechanism and the dominant factor for this phenomenon ? _ ( c ) _ what parameter should be used to characterize this position ? _ these questions are our concern . finding the solution of these problems is important to the understanding of the phenomenon and the estimation of flow transition . because the turbulence transition is generally resulted in by flow instability @xcite , we think that the critical condition of transition should be determined by the position where the _ flow instability _ first takes place . if the mechanism of flow instability is sought out and the most dangerous position is found , the critical condition of transition could be determined .",
    ".characteristic of transition of hagen - poiseuille flow ( pipe poiseuille flow ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "nishioka et al ( 1975 ) s famous experiments @xcite for plane poiseuille flow showed details of the outline and process of the flow breakdown .",
    "the measured instantaneous velocity distributions suggest that the break down of the flow is a local phenomenon , at least in its initial stage . as in fig.8 , the base flow is laminar and the instantaneous distribution of the velocity breaks at the position @xmath14 ( @xmath15 to @xmath16 ) to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 to @xmath19 ) by showing an oscillation of velocity in @xmath20 .",
    "they show an inflectional velocity in this range of @xmath21 .",
    "this result means that the flow breakdown first occurs in the range of @xmath22 .",
    "this coincides to the prediction of our theory , i.e. , the position of @xmath2 is the most dangerous point which occurs at @xmath23 .",
    "these results are enough to confirm the theory of energy gradient  valid at least for poiseuille flows ( pressure driving flow ) .    for pipe flow",
    ", in a recent study @xcite , wedin and kerswell showed that there is the presence of the shoulder  in the velocity profile at about @xmath24 from their solution of travelling waves .",
    "they suggested that this corresponds to where the fast streaks of traveling waves reach from the wall .",
    "it  can be construed that this kind of velocity profile as obtained by simulation is similar to that of nishioka et al s experiments for channel flows .",
    "the location of the shoulder  is about same as that for @xmath2 . according to the present theory , this shoulder",
    "may then be intricately related to the distribution of energy gradient .",
    "the solution of traveling waves has been confirmed by experiments more recently @xcite .",
    "the energy gradient theory can also be used to explain the reason why it is not appropriate to scale the outer flow or overlap profiles of channel flow and those of pipe flow at the same reynolds number turbulent flowswosnik00 .",
    "this is easily understood by the fact that pipe poiseuille flow has a same velocity and energy gradient distributions in the radial direction as the plane poiseuille flow has in the @xmath25 direction , but the former has a smaller hydraulic diameter than the latter and has more viscous friction .",
    "therefore , the scaling should be carried out at the same @xmath26 value , but not at the same reynolds number ( fig.8 ) .  at a same reynolds number , for example ,",
    "say , @xmath11 , the plane poiseuille flow reaches the critical @xmath4 number for transition , while pipe poiseuille flow is far from the critical @xmath4 number , as shown in fig.9a .",
    "the flow state at these two flows are definitely different at this re number .",
    "this principle also applies to turbulence flow range .",
    "if we compare the two type of flows at same @xmath2 value , they should have the same flow behaviour ( fig.9b ) .    in a separating paper @xcite ( owing to the space limit here )",
    ", we apply the energy gradient theory to the shear driving flows , and show that this theory is also correct for plane couette flow .",
    "we obtain @xmath27 at the critical transition condition determined by experiments below which no turbulence occurs ( see table 3 ) .",
    "this value is near the value for poiseuille flows , @xmath28 .",
    "the minute difference in the number is not important because there is some difference in the determination of the critical condition .",
    "for example , the judgement of transition is from the chart of drag coefficient in patel and head @xcite , while visualization method is used in @xcite .",
    "these results demonstrate that the critical value of @xmath2 at subcritical transition for wall bounded parallel flows including both pressure driven and shear driven flows is about @xmath29 .",
    "more recently , the energy gradient theory is applied to the taylor - couette flow between concentric rotating cylinders @xcite .",
    "the detailed derivation for the calculation of the energy gradient parameter is provided in the study .",
    "the theoretical results for the critical condition of primary instability obtain very good agreement with taylor s experiments ( 1923 ) taylor1923 and others , see fig.10 .",
    "taylor ( 1923 ) used mathematical theory and linear stability analysis and showed that linear theory obtained agreement with the experiments .",
    "however , as is well know and discussed before , linear theory is failed for wall bounded parallel flows .",
    "as shown in this paper , the present theory is valid for all of these said flows .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that the energy gradient theory is a universal theory for the flow instability and turbulent transition which is valid for both pressure and shear driven flows in both parallel flow and rotating flow configurations .",
    "the rayleigh - benard convective instability and the stratified flow instability could also be considered as being produced by the energy gradient transverse to the flow ( thermal or gravitational energy ) .",
    "the energy gradient theory can be not only used to predict the generation of turbulence , but also it may be applied to the area of catastrophic event predictions , such as weather forecast , earthquakes , landslides , mountain coast , snow avalanche , motion of mantle , and movement of sand piles in desert , etc .",
    "the breakdown of these mechanical systems can be universally described in detail using this theory . in a material system ,",
    "when the maximum of energy gradient in some direction is greater than a critical value for given material properties , the system will be unstable .",
    "if there is a disturbance input to this system , the energy gradient may amplify the disturbance and lead to the system breakdown .",
    "this problem will be further addressed in future study .",
    "the mechanism for the flow instability and turbulent transition in parallel shear flows is studied in this paper .",
    "the energy gradient theory is proposed for the flow instability .",
    "the theory is applied to plane channel flow and hagen - poiseuille flow .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are as follows :    1 .",
    "a mechanism of flow instability and turbulence transition is presented for parallel shear flows .",
    "the theory of energy gradient is proposed to explain the mechanism of flow instability and turbulence transition .",
    "it is stated that the energy gradient in transverse direction tries to amplifythe small disturbance , while viscous friction in streamwise direction could resist or absorb this small disturbance .",
    "initiation of instability depends upon the two roles for given initial disturbance .",
    "viscosity mainly plays a stable role to the initiation of flow instability by affecting the base flow .",
    "a universal criterion for the flow instability initiation has been formulated for wall shear flows .",
    "a new dimensionless parameter characterizing the flow instability , @xmath0 , which is defined as the ratio of the energy gradients in transverse direction and that in streamwise direction , is proposed for wall bounded shear flows . the most dangerous position in the flow field",
    "can be represented by the maximum of @xmath0 .",
    "the initiation of flow breakdown should take place at this position first .",
    "this idea is confirmed by nishioka et al.s experiments .",
    "the concept of energy angle is proposed for flow instability .",
    "this concept helps to understand the mechanism of viscous instabilities . using the concept of energy gradient and energy angle , it is theoretically demonstrated for the first time that _",
    "viscous flow with a velocity inflection is unstable_. 4 .",
    "it is demonstrated that there is a critical value of the parameter @xmath30 at which the flow transits to turbulence for both plane poiseuille flow and pipe poiseuille flow , below which no turbulence exists .",
    "this value is about @xmath31 .",
