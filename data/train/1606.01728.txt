    "avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) are widely used in a variety of fields , such as single molecule detection @xcite , autocorrelated fluorescent decays and quantum information @xcite , to detect extremely weak light signals or even single photons .",
    "the latter is usually named a single - photon avalanche detector ( spad ) , which is an essential device and may greatly influence the performance of the system in many applications , especially in quantum information fields @xcite .",
    "spads usually work in two different modes : free - running mode and gated mode . for free - running mode ,",
    "the spad is biased above its breakdown voltage to allow an avalanche to occur . for gated mode",
    ", the spad is commonly biased below its breakdown voltage , and the avalanche process can only happen in gating time windows when additional gate voltage signals are superimposed .",
    "there are many parameters that can be used to quantify the performance of spads , such as the clocking rate , dark count rate , detection efficiency and timing jitter . in the past decade , the performance of spads has been greatly improved and they can work at a gigahertz clocking frequency with up to one hundred megahertz counting rates@xcite .",
    "the afterpulsing effect of spads severely limits the count rate and hinders applications that require precise measurements .",
    "afterpulsing , which is correlated with the ignition avalanche , comes from the detrapping of carriers that were trapped at a deep energy level in the junction depletion region @xcite .",
    "the trapped carriers are then released from the traps over time by thermal fluctuation . usually",
    ", the release lifetime @xmath0 is dependent on the type of trap and can vary from 10 @xmath1 to several microseconds @xcite , which is usually much longer than that needed for quenching an avalanche .",
    "a releasing carrier may initiate another pseudo detection signal , which is usually called an afterpulse , if the spad is biased above the breakdown voltage .",
    "the pseudo signal leads to negative effects on spad s applications .",
    "for example , afterpulsing will increase the quantum bit error rate in the quantum key distribution @xcite and will destroy the randomness of a quantum random number generator @xcite . to reduce afterpulsing ,",
    "another hold - off time depending on @xmath0 is necessary .",
    "the afterpulsing effect is negligible if the hold - off time is much longer than the carrier lifetime @xmath0 , but this is not practical for high - count - rate spads .",
    "many approaches have been proposed to reduce afterpulsing @xcite , but it remains a critical limitation for high - count - rate spads . precisely modeling",
    "the behavior of afterpulsing is the necessary foundation to address this problem .    in this paper",
    ", we studied the afterpulsing influence of multi - ignition avalanches on the photon detection process of ingaas / inp spads under different gate frequencies and photon intensities and found that afterpulsing possesses a memory effect and thus correlates to the avalanching history .",
    "we call this property as non - markovian property @xcite .",
    "we developed analytical expressions for the afterpulsing influence on photon detection , enabling it to be quantified .",
    "we also conducted experiments to verify the theoretical relationships and the experimental results fit well with the theoretical model .",
    "the model is instructive to manufacturing processes and the afterpulsing evaluation of high - count - rate spads",
    ". it also offers a new perspective to address the practical security of quantum communication with imperfect devices @xcite .",
    "the spad ( fig . [ fig : spad](a ) ) absorbs an incident photon in the depletion region ( i region ) and creates an electron - hole pair @xcite .",
    "the electron then drifts into the avalanche region ( p region ) and triggers an avalanche .",
    "the avalanche amplifies the photocurrent so that the initial absorption event can be detected .",
    "some carriers ( electrons or holes ) are trapped during the avalanche process due to material defects .",
    "the release of a carrier in the p region may initiate an afterpulse when the spad is biased above the breakdown voltage .",
    "the trap lifetime @xmath0 of carriers in a spad can be described by the arrhenius equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the activation energy of the trap , @xmath4 is the temperature , @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath6 is determined by the relevant effective state density , cross - section of the trap and temperature @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the carrier release probability is then exponential with respect to the time @xmath7 . as the types of traps in apd are dependent on practical manufacturing processes , there are thereby a variety of traps with different lifetimes @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the afterpulsing probability ( ap ) during a detection window @xmath9 contains different exponential components @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the amplitudes of different exponential components , and",
    "@xmath12 means the ap of the @xmath13-th detection window after the ignition avalanche .",
    "recently , different fitting methods have been studied that employ a broad distribution of different exponential components instead of summating a few dominant discrete ones @xcite .",
    "so far , most studies on the afterpulsing effect just have focused on its time - dependent probability distribution ignited by a single light pulse and do not discriminate the situation of a single ignition avalanche from that with multiple avalanches @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the real situation when the spad works continuously for photon detection . in this case",
    ", several avalanches may happen successively within the lifetimes of the trapped carriers .",
    "previous works have demonstrated that the number of traps filled with carriers during an avalanche event is much smaller than the total number @xcite .",
    "thus , avalanches happening successively will increase the number of filled traps .",
    "[ fig : spad](b ) gives a simplified view of the filling process .",
    "different photon pulses will be absorbed by different atoms in the i region and the initial electron then drifts into p region . here , the initial electron randomly collides atoms and each collision may create another unbound electron .",
    "the collision makes the paths of the initial and newly unbound electrons unpredictable .",
    "these unbound electrons continue the collision process until the edge of the p region .",
    "some defects may be filled by electrons during transfers and collisions . as the filling is rare and the collisions are unpredictable , filling processes of different avalanches affect each other little , as does the release processes .      as discussed above",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the filling and release processes of different traps are independent .",
    "thus , avalanches occurring closely will increase the number of trapped carriers and hence will enhance the ap .",
    "that is , the ap distribution will be correlated to the avalanching history , while prior studies have not delved down into this physical procedure . in the following paragraphs of this section , we will analyze the ap distribution of an spad that avalanches continuously within the lifetime of the dominant carriers .",
    "considering that the trap level distribution is a technological parameter , which is determined once the product is fabricated and the details have been studied well , we do not consider the specific time - dependent distribution of the ap in the next analysis .",
    "the primary data of ap distribution can be obtained by experimental measurements .",
    "the probability of an avalanche triggering by a laser pulse and dark count can be derived from the poisson distribution , and the avalanche probabilities of different gates ( detection windows ) have an independent identical distribution ( iid ) @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 be the photon - ignition avalanche probability per gate , @xmath12 be the single - ignition ap of gate-@xmath13 and @xmath15 be the total avalanche probability of gate-@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the detection efficiency of the spad and @xmath18 is the average photon number per laser pulse .",
    "`` single - ignition '' means that for a sequence of detection gates , only the first gate ( gate-0 ) is triggered by the laser pulse .",
    "thus , there is no afterpulsing for gate-0 and @xmath19 .",
    "the ap is determined by the avalanching history .",
    "the full - expression of @xmath15 , which depends on the avalanching history , is very complex .",
    "for example , if gate-@xmath20 avalanches , its afterpulsing effect will affect all the following gates .",
    "if gate-@xmath13 avalanches , its afterpulsing effect will affect the gates after it .",
    "the full ap expressions of gate-@xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and gate-@xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are as follows : @xmath25+(1-p)p = p[1+(1-p)p_a(1 ) ] , \\label{equ : p1}\\ ] ]    @xmath26\\{p+(1-p)[p_a(1)+p_a(2)]\\}\\\\ & + p\\{1-[p+(1-p)p_a(1)]\\}[p+(1-p)p_a(2)]\\\\ & + ( 1-p)p_1 .",
    "\\end{aligned }   \\label{equ : p2}\\ ] ]    here we give a formal expression of @xmath15 , and then give the approximate equation of @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath15 can be classified into two sets : gate-0 avalanches in the first set @xmath27 and does not avalanche in the second set @xmath28 .",
    "the second set can be expressed as @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath15 can then be expressed as @xmath30    if the single - ignition ap @xmath12 is small , and only the first order terms are reserved , namely , @xmath31 , then we obtain the approximate equation of equation [ equ5 ] , @xmath32 .",
    "\\label{equ6}\\ ] ] see appendix for a detailed proof of equation [ equ6 ] .",
    "in fact , the formal expression is enough for the proof .",
    "if the ap is only determined by the latest ignition avalanche @xcite , the afterpulsing is markovian ( has no memory of prior avalanching history ) .",
    "that is , if gate-@xmath33 avalanches , @xmath34 .",
    "if gate-@xmath33 does not avalanche , gate-@xmath35 is considered , and so on .",
    "then the approximate equation of @xmath15 becomes @xmath36 .",

    "comparing equation [ equ6 ] with equation [ equ4 ] , we find that the non - markovian property makes the afterpulsing effect more significant .",
    "in this section , we describe experiments to verify the non - markovian property of afterpulsing .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : setup ] ( a ) .",
    "the laser diode ( ld ) is operated in pulsed mode .",
    "laser pulses from the ld are attenuated by an adjustable attenuator and are then sent into the spad . the spad ( princeton lightwave pga-300 , the operating temperature is @xmath37 @xmath38 . )",
    "is operated in gated mode without dead time and the gate width is 2.5 @xmath1 .",
    "its detection efficiency @xmath17 is approximately @xmath39 .",
    "the spad outputs a detection signal if an avalanche occurs .",
    "the detection signals are input into a time - to - digital converter ( tdc , agilent u1051a acqiris tc890 ) in real time",
    ". the tdc records the arrival time of every detection signal with a resolution of 50 @xmath40 .",
    "the ld , spad and time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) are triggered and synchronized by a synchronizing and modulating circuit .",
    "[ equ6 ] indicates that the non - markov effect of afterpulsing will be more significant if the single - ignition ap @xmath12 or light intensity increases . to verify eq .",
    "[ equ6 ] , we should measure first the single - ignition ap distribution @xmath12 and second the total avalanche probability @xmath15 of gate-@xmath16 with multi - ignition pulses .",
    "[ fig : setup](b ) shows the modulating signal of the ld .",
    "the number of trigger pulses @xmath41 ( and thus the number of light pulses per interval ) , trigger frequency @xmath42 and interval time @xmath43 are adjustable .",
    "@xmath44 corresponds to the single - ignition case . to measure the ap distribution , the time with no trigger of every interval should be much longer than the carriers lifetime @xmath0 , that is , @xmath45 .",
    "the spad is triggered continuously by an external pulsed signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](c ) ) with frequency @xmath42 .",
    "parameter @xmath46 can be modulated by adjusting the attenuator , and parameter @xmath12 can be modulated by changing the trigger frequency @xmath42 while keeping the light intensity per pulse constant .",
    "the experiment consists of three scenarios . in * scenario ( a ) * ,",
    "single - ignition ( @xmath44 ) ap distributions under different trigger frequencies ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 mhz ) are measured .",
    "the average photon number @xmath18 per pulse is set as 0.07 .",
    "the ap @xmath12 is the avalanche probability of gate-@xmath13 after subtracting the dark count probability .    in * scenario",
    "( b ) * , the avalanche probabilities of gate-@xmath16 @xmath15 with different average photon numbers per pulse @xmath18 ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) are measured , while the ap distribution @xmath12 varies little .",
    "this scenario is used to see how @xmath15 changes with @xmath46 ( @xmath14 ) . as a contrast",
    ", the slope of @xmath15 will decay faster via @xmath46 if the afterpulsing is markovian .    in * scenario ( c )",
    "* , the ap distribution @xmath12 is modulated , while @xmath18 is kept constant . as",
    "discussed in section [ afterpulsing ] , the original ap distribution is given by the device technology and operation conditions and does not change . however , according to equation [ equ2 ] , the value of ap with time , @xmath12 , can be changed by re - sampling the detection period @xmath9 .",
    "hence , in this scenario , the trigger frequency @xmath42 is modulated ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 mhz ) so that the value of @xmath12 becomes different , while @xmath18 is set as constant ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this scenario is used to see how @xmath15 changes with @xmath12 .",
    "this scenario is also used to measure the multi - ignition ap distribution @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the avalanche probability of gate-@xmath52 . for all scenarios ,",
    "the dark count rates per gate are under the order of @xmath53 .",
    "single and multi - ignition ap distributions with different triggering frequency @xmath42 are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : afpprobdist ] .",
    "the experimental data demonstrate that ap increases as @xmath42 increases , where @xmath51 for all cases . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : afpprobdist](a ) , the total single - ignition ap @xmath54 when @xmath55 mhz , while @xmath56 when @xmath57 mhz .",
    "it also demonstrates that multi - ignition aps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : afpprobdist](b ) ) are much larger than the single - ignition ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : afpprobdist](a ) ) . for example , when @xmath58 mhz , the multi - ignition ap of gate-@xmath52 is @xmath59 , while the corresponding single - ignition ap is @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , the total single - ignition ap @xmath61 .",
    "this means that the ap accumulates as @xmath41 increases .",
    "namely , ap depends on the avalanching history and is non - markovian .",
    "the ap becomes larger as @xmath42 increases .",
    "as the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the detection signal output from the spad is approximately 40 @xmath1 , the saturated processing rate of the discrimination circuit is less than 20 mhz by taking the processing time into account .",
    "thus , @xmath62 is measured to be smaller than the actual value when @xmath57 mhz . however , the processing rate limitation is not that significant for the experiments because the average photon number @xmath51 , which is small , when @xmath57 mhz .    scenario ( b ) ( see fig .",

    "[ equ6 ] ( the red lines ) well .",
    "it proves that the approximate equation is sufficient to describe the non - markovian property of afterpulsing . as predicted by eq .",
    "[ equ4 ] , the slope of @xmath15 ( the black lines ) of the markovian model decays faster than that of the experimental data .",
    "the difference between the non - markovian model and markovian model is negligible when the photon - ignition avalanche probability @xmath46 ( @xmath63 ) is small enough .",
    "the difference becomes more significant when @xmath46 increases , e. g. , fig .",

    "scenario ( c ) provides differences of @xmath15 between the non - markovian and markovian models with different @xmath12 ( see fig .",

    "there is hardly any difference between these two model when @xmath55 mhz ( @xmath65 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : different gate](a ) .",
    "however , the difference becomes @xmath66 for large @xmath16 when @xmath57 mhz ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the experimental results above are all well consistent with the non - markovian analysis . according to eq .",
    "[ equ6 ] , the afterpulsing influence on photon detection depends on the product of the photon - ignition avalanche probability and the total ap . in both fig .",

    "[ fig : different gate](a ) , @xmath68 is very small ( approximately @xmath69 ) , and the markov model also fits well with the experimental data , although the assumption is incorrect .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fig : different pa](b),(c),(d ) and [ fig : different gate](b),(c),(d ) , the markovian model can no longer fit with the data , as @xmath68 becomes larger ( about @xmath70 in [ fig : different pa](d ) and [ fig : different gate](d ) ) .",
    "the non - markovian effect of afterpulsing will be more significant for higher @xmath71 .",
    "this is really the case for high - count - rate spads .",
    "it should be noted that , due to the limit of the designed processing circuit , the detection efficiency of the spad varies with the trigger frequency @xmath42 . to make a comparison of the ap influence with different frequencies , the gate voltage loaded on the spad is fine adjusted so that detection efficiency varies less ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "otherwise , afterpulsing would be a catastrophe and the spad under @xmath57 mhz could no longer work properly if the voltage remains the same as that under @xmath55 mhz . by utilizing high - speed ( e.g. , 100 mhz ) processing circuit with improved design ,",
    "the detection efficiency will vary less under the same conditions .",
    "early works have demonstrated that the number of traps filled with carriers during an avalanche event is much smaller than the total number in both visible and near - infrared apd @xcite .",
    "thus , the afterpulsing effects of these types of spads can be described by the non - markovian model shown in figure [ fig : spad ] . recently",
    ", afterpulsing effect is still a serious limit toward high - count - rate spads @xcite .",
    "the spads with gigahertz clocking frequency and one hundred megahertz counting rate are mainly reached by circuit improvement , by which the gate voltage , total avalanche current and the ap have been suppressed significantly @xcite .",
    "however , the material quality has not been improved much in the last decade @xcite and the defects of the materials are still in large quantity @xcite . hence , despite that only a particular commercial ingaas / inp spad has been verified in this paper , the non - markovian model is general for spads unless a significant breakthrough of the fabrication technology is being made .",
    "our work reveals that the circuit quenching method , which can not change the intrinsic non - markovian property of afterpulsing , will remain one of the bottlenecks for higher - count - rate spads .",
    "the once and for all solution is to reduce the defects in the materials or to erase the trapped carriers before the arrival of the next photon .",
    "in conclusion , we have proved that the afterpulsing effect of the spad has a memory of the avalanching history and is hence non - markovian . the approximate expression ( eq .",

    "the non - markovian effect will be more significant for higher @xmath71 .",
    "this is the case for high - count - rate spads , where the detection period is much smaller than the lifetime of the carriers @xcite .",
    "as the embodiment of rarely filling of traps , the non - markovian property of afterpulsing should be general to different types of spads provided that the filling is rare during an avalanching process .",
    "our work makes the principle of the afterpulsing effect clearer and is instructive to manufacturing processes and the afterpulsing evaluation of high - count - rate spads .",
    "it also offers a new perspective to consider the practical security of quantum communication due to the imperfection of devices .",

    "<S> the single - photon avalanche photodiode(spad ) has been widely used in research on quantum optics . the afterpulsing effect , which is an intrinsic character of spad , affects the system performance in most experiments and needs to be carefully handled . for a long time , afterpulsing has been presumed to be determined by the pre - ignition avalanche . </S>",
    "<S> we studied the afterpulsing effect of a commercial ingaas / inp spad ( the avalanche photodiode model is : princeton lightwave pga-300 ) and demonstrated that its afterpulsing is non - markovian , with a memory effect in the avalanching history . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical analysis and experimental results clearly indicate that the embodiment of this memory effect is the afterpulsing probability , which increases as the number of ignition - avalanche pulses increase . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion makes the principle of the afterpulsing effect clearer and is instructive to the manufacturing processes and afterpulsing evaluation of high - count - rate spads . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be regarded as a fundamental premise to handle the afterpulsing signals in many applications , such as quantum communication and quantum random number generation . </S>"
