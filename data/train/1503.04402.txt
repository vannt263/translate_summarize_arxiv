    "an experimental search for gravitational waves ( gw ) is one of the most intriguing problems in modern physics .",
    "the discovery of gws will give us confidence that we are moving in the right direction in understanding classical gravity .",
    "if we can not detect gws , then either our apparatus is not sensitive enough or something is not taken into account when considering the propagation of gws .",
    "one of the effects accompanying the propagation of gws could be its interaction with a nonperturbative spinor vacuum .",
    "the reason for such an interaction to occur is that the energy - momentum tensor of a spinor field contains the spin connection , which in turn contains first derivatives of tetrad components with respect to the coordinates . as a result ,",
    "the einstein equations give the wave equation for a gw which contains second derivatives of the tetrad components on the left - hand side and their first derivatives on the right - hand side .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have considered the propagation of a weak gw interacting with the nonperturbative spinor vacuum . here we extend those results to the case of a strong gw . in doing so , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , to model the nonperturbative vacuum of a spinor field , we will use a phenomenological approach . within the framework of this approach",
    ", we make some physically reasonable assumptions about expectation values of the spinor field and its dispersion .",
    "this will permit us to reduce the infinite system of differential equations for all green s functions of the nonperturbative quantum spinor field to the finite set of equations ( for more details , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    following this approach , here",
    "we will discuss the solution of the einstein equations for a strong gw propagating on the background of the nonperturbative vacuum of spinor fields , which is a generalization of the weak , plane gravitational wave of ref .",
    "according to the textbook @xcite , the metric for a strong gw propagating in one direction is sought in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 are lightlike coordinates , and the indices @xmath2 run over the values @xmath3 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the new variables @xmath4 the only nonvanishing component of the einstein tensor @xmath5 is @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the tetrad index and @xmath8 is the spacetime index ) , so that one can obtain the following einstein equation for the strong gw propagating in a flat vacuum spacetime : @xmath9 here the dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is the two - dimensional tensor reciprocal to @xmath12 .",
    "the function @xmath13 is an unknown function , and @xmath12 are arbitrary functions , obeying the constraint .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the presence of the term @xmath14 has the result that after a finite time interval @xmath15 becomes zero .",
    "this in turn leads to vanishing of the metric determinant @xmath16 , i.e. , a singularity in the metric . but",
    "this singularity is not physically significant since it is related only to the unsatisfactory nature of the reference frame , `` spoiled '' by the passing gravitational wave , and can be eliminated by a suitable coordinate transformation .",
    "our goal here is to consider the propagation of gws in a nonperturbative spinor vacuum .",
    "we expect that such a physical system has to be considered in nonperturbative language when both a metric and a spinor field are regarded as quantum quantities and are quantized in a nonperturbative manner",
    ". then , to describe the interaction between a quantum metric and a quantum spinor field , we have to write down the einstein - dirac operator equations .",
    "our nonperturbative approach for quantizing nonlinear fields is described in ref .",
    "@xcite . within this method",
    ", we have , strictly speaking , to solve the following operator equations : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the operator of the einstein tensor ; @xmath19 is the operator of the energy - momentum tensor ; @xmath20 is the operator of the spinor field ; @xmath21 is the tetrad index ; @xmath22 is the coordinate index ; @xmath23 is the covariant derivative for the spinor with the appropriate spin connection ; @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the gravitational constant",
    ". hereafter we use units where @xmath26 .    as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the solution for such a set of operator equations can be found by writing down and subsequent solving an infinite system of equations for all green s functions for quantum fields . in practice ,",
    "such a procedure can be carried out only approximately .",
    "this means that we have to use some physical arguments to cut off the above - mentioned _ infinite _ set of equations , and then solve the resulting _ finite _ set of equations .",
    "our approach is based on the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the metric remains always classical .",
    "2 .   the spinor field is quantum .",
    "the spinor field is decomposed as a product of @xmath27 and @xmath28numbers .",
    "4 .   in order to calculate the energy - momentum tensor of the spinor field ,",
    "we assume some anstze for a 2-point green s function of @xmath29 .    in such an approximation the einstein - dirac operator equations and can be written in the following manner  @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the quantum averaging with respect to the quantum state @xmath32 .",
    "also , to check the consistency of the anstze for a 2-point green s function , instead of solving the dirac equation  , we will use the bianchi identities , as we did in ref .",
    "in order to write down the energy - momentum tensor for a vacuum of a spinor field interacting with a gw , we must have a model of a nonperturbative vacuum of the spinor field .",
    "let us emphasize once more that we can not use a perturbative model of a spinor field since in the presence of a gravitational field the set of equations and is a strongly nonlinear system",
    ".    taking this into account and following ref .",
    "@xcite , our strategy in the formulation of the model of the nonperturbative spinor vacuum is as follows : ( i ) we write some classical anstze for a spinor ; ( ii ) we derive the corresponding energy - momentum tensor ; and ( iii ) we then write hats over the corresponding spinor components .    as the first step ,",
    "we take the anstze for the classical spinor in the form @xmath33 for the tetrad below , there is only one nonvanishing component @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , we have to choose the components of the spinor @xmath34 so that we obtain the corresponding component @xmath35 .",
    "this happens if @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath38 where the prime denotes @xmath39 .    with the anstze and the energy - momentum tensor in hand",
    ", we suggest the following approximate model of the nonperturbative vacuum of the spinor field .    *",
    "the nonperturbative vacuum is described by the following operator of the spinor field : @xmath40 the constant operators @xmath41 appearing here are independent of @xmath10 . *",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum tensor of the spinor field is @xmath42 * to check this model , we calculate the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor and show that it vanishes .",
    "for the metric , we seek a solution of the einstein equations for a strong gw propagating through the nonperturbative spinor vacuum .",
    "the tetrad for this metric is @xmath43 with the corresponding two - dimensional metric @xmath44 here @xmath45 and @xmath46 are arbitrary functions  @xcite .",

    "one sees immediately that eq .",
    "is a schrdinger - like equation with the effective potential @xmath54    in what follows we will seek periodic solutions to eq .  .",
    "it is clear that for periodic functions @xmath55 we obtain an equation similar to that describing the movement of a single electron in a crystal .",
