    "@xmath3 the situation is radically different .    in this paper",
    "we study the multiple point spaces of stable perturbations of two map - germs of corank 2 from @xmath1-space to @xmath2-space . in one case @xmath4 and in the other @xmath5 .",

    "increasing the dimension introduces new difficulties .",
    "confronting these will require a range of new techniques .",
    "our work here is a preliminary exploration . following the invitation of the editors to provide an accessible account ,",
    "we have expanded the preliminary material on multiple - point spaces , disentanglements , and the image computing spectral sequence icss , our principle technical tool , and included , in section [ examples ] , some examples of calculation using the icss .",
    "the first of the two corank 2 map - germs we look at is the germ of lowest codimension in sharland s list ( @xcite ) of weighted homogeneous corank 2 map - germs @xmath7 : [ deff]f_0:(@xmath8 ^ 3,0)(@xmath8 ^ 4,0),f_0(x , y , z)=(x , y^2+xz+x^2y , yz , z^2+y^3).this has @xmath9-codimension 18 .",

    "a richer picture is obtained by considering the `` semi - simplicial resolution '' [ ssr ] here , for each integer @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the closure , in @xmath17 , of the set of @xmath18-tuples of pairwise distinct points ( `` strict '' k - tuple points ) sharing the same image , and the @xmath18 distinct arrows @xmath19 , @xmath20 , are the restriction of the projections @xmath21 obtained by forgetting the @xmath22th factor in the product @xmath17 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "an @xmath24-finite mono - germ @xmath25 will have no strict @xmath18-tuple points , since the dimension of @xmath26 at a strict @xmath18-tuple point is @xmath27 ( see subsection [ mpi ] below ) .",
    "in this case @xmath26 is defined by a slightly different procedure : we pick a stable unfolding @xmath28 of @xmath11 , define @xmath29 as above , and then take @xmath26 as the fibre over @xmath30 of @xmath29 .",
    "we note that it is an easy consequence of the mather - gaffney criterion for @xmath24-finiteness that if we apply this second procedure when @xmath31 , we get the same space @xmath26 as defined above .",
    "the disentanglement , in this wider sense , contains complete information about the way that points of @xmath12 are identified by @xmath32 . the image @xmath33 has the homotopy type of a wedge of @xmath1-spheres ( @xcite ) whose number , the  image milnor number \" of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , is the key geometric invariant of an @xmath24- finite germ @xmath0 . since the homology of @xmath33 arises through the identifications induced by @xmath32 ,",

    "note that in both cases ,    if @xmath118 for @xmath119 then @xmath120 . if @xmath121 for some @xmath122 , then we can take @xmath123 so the homology class we get in @xmath124 is zero .",
    "so we are really interested in @xmath125      lurking behind the two calculations we have just gone through is the _ image - computing spectral sequence _ , icss .",
    "this was introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "it calculates the homology of the image @xmath33 in terms of the alternating homology @xmath126 of the multiple point spaces @xmath16 .",
    "the version introduced in @xcite worked with the subspace of @xmath127 on which @xmath77 acts by its sign representation : @xmath128\\in h_i(d^k(f);{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{q}}}}):\\sigma_*([c])=\\text{sign}(\\sigma)[c]\\ \\text{for all } \\sigma\\in s_k\\}.\\ ] ] if we take the complex of alternating chains described in the last paragraph and replace integer coefficients by rational coefficients , then the two versions coincide : @xmath129    the icss has @xmath130 and converges to @xmath131 .",
    "the differential on the @xmath132 page , @xmath133 is the simplicial differential @xmath134 . in @xcite ,",
    "a great deal hinges on the fact that for a stable perturbation @xmath32 of an @xmath24-finite germ @xmath11 of corank 1 , the @xmath16 are milnor fibres of the isolated complete intersection singularities @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) , and therefore their vanishing homology is confined to middle dimension . since ( over @xmath135 ) @xmath136 , the vanishing alternating homology of @xmath16 is also confined to middle dimension . from this",
    "it follows , in the case of a stable perturbation of a mono - germ , that the icss collapses at @xmath132 : for all @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "the fact that the spectral sequence converges to @xmath131 therefore means that , as @xmath135-vector space , [ icsscor]h_n(x_t)h_n-1^(d^2(f_t))h_n-2^(d^3(f_t))h_0^(d^n+1(f_t ) ) .",
    "the argument for collapse is as follows : for each space @xmath139 there is at most one non - zero alternating homology group , @xmath140 , and therefore either the source or the target of every differential at @xmath132 is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath141 .",
    "the higher differentials @xmath142 all vanish for exactly the same reason : for each one , either its source or its target is zero .",
    "notice that this is exactly what is needed to justify the assumptions we made in our two calculations in the previous paragraph .",
    "whenever @xmath16 has non - trivial alternating homology in dimension @xmath22 , then @xmath143 does not .",
    "the situation for stable perturbations of multi - germs is slightly more complicated , as can be seen with the example of reidemeister moves ii and iii in section [ reidemeister ] below . here",
    "@xmath16 may have more than one connected component , and hence have vanishing alternating homology in dimension @xmath13 as well as in middle dimension .",
    "as the calculations with reidemeister moves ii and iii show , the differentials @xmath144 may not all be zero .    from it follows that for a stable perturbation of a mono - germ [ mooi]_i(f)=_k=2^n+1h_n - k+1^(d^k(f_t)).in ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.6 ) , kevin houston showed that if @xmath32 is a stable perturbation of an @xmath24-finite mono - germ @xmath11 , then the _ alternating _ homology of @xmath16 is once again confined to middle dimension , even though the ordinary homology of @xmath26 may not be .",
    "of the germ @xmath145 described below , both @xmath146 and @xmath147 have non - trivial homology below middle dimension . ] from houston s theorem its follows that and hold for stable perturbations of mono - germs of any corank .",
    "in both of our examples of corank 2 mono - germs , the multiplicity of @xmath11 , @xmath148 is equal to 3 , so @xmath32 has no quadruple or higher multiple points , and reduces to [ hgm]_i(f_0)=h_n-1^(d^2(f_t))+h_n-2^(d^3(f_t ) ) .",
    "if @xmath54 is a germ with @xmath149 , then implies that the vanishing homology of the image comes from just one of the multiple point spaces .",
    "it is an interesting project to determine , for each such @xmath11 , which one this is .",
    "it is possible to show that _ the answer depends only on the isomorphism class of the local algebra of @xmath11_. it is far from clear to me how to determine the answer from the local algebra .      from here on , and in the rest of the paper , we will consider only homology with rational coefficients , and by @xmath150 we will mean always @xmath151 .",
    "each multiple - point space @xmath16 is acted upon by the symmetric group @xmath77 , permuting the factors of @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting representation of @xmath77 on @xmath152 splits as a direct sum of isotypal components , whose ranks are the principle numerical invariants of the disentanglement .",
    "we have @xmath153 where the two summands are the subspaces of @xmath154 on which @xmath155 acts trivially , and by its sign representation , respectively , and @xmath156 where now the summands correspond to the trivial , sign and irreducible degree 2 representation of @xmath157 .",

    "lemma [ conl ] , with @xmath171 , applies to both of the germs we consider .",
    "smoothness of @xmath172 can be seen in each case by considering a presentation of @xmath163 .",
    "suppose @xmath34 has corank @xmath3 .",
    "we have no closed formula for generators of the ideal defining @xmath51 for @xmath173 , but for @xmath109 there is a formula , introduced in @xcite , for germs of any corank .",
    "the ideal @xmath174 obtained by pulling back the ideal defining the diagonal in @xmath175 vanishes on @xmath109 , but also on the diagonal in @xmath176 . to remove @xmath177 and leave only the points in the closure of the set of strict double points , we proceed as follows .",
    "the ideal @xmath174 , generated by @xmath178 , for @xmath179 , is contained in @xmath180 , which is generated by @xmath181 .",
    "thus for @xmath182 there are functions @xmath183 such that @xmath184 the @xmath185 matrix @xmath186 restricts to the jacobian matrix of @xmath34 on @xmath177 .",

    "then @xmath188 , as defined by @xmath189 , is cohen - macaulay of dimension @xmath190 , and normal .",
    "the proof of cohen - macaulayness has been part of the folklore for some time , but has recently been written up carefully by nuo - ballesteros and peafort in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 , @xmath188 is therefore a normal surface singularity , and so by the greuel - steenbrink theorem , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) , @xmath191 .",
