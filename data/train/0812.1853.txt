    "in our previous paper  @xcite , hereafter referred to as i , we have formulated a kinetic theory of self - interacting meson fields with an aim to describe the freezeout stage of the space - time evolution of matter in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . by using a single component real scalar field model we have obtained a set of coupled equations of motion for the meson condensate and the quasi - particle excitations .",
    "the meson condensate obeys the classical field equation with a modification due to the coupling to mesonic quasi - particle excitations , which is expressed in terms of the wigner functions defined by quantum statistical expectation values of the bilinear forms of the quantized field operators .",
    "the wigner functions contain the off - diagonal components which can be eliminated by bogoliubov transformation in uniform systems , but survive in general non - uniform systems .",
    "we also solved the kinetic theory in and near equilibrium and studied a gap equation and the dispersion relation of the collective excitations .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to apply this formalism to the @xmath0 symmetric linear sigma model which possesses a continuous symmetry . for @xmath1 ,",
    "this model may be considered as an effective field theory of qcd with light quark flavors : the chiral condensate is described in terms of the sigma meson condensate , which is defined by the expectation value of the first component of the @xmath2-component scalar quantum fields .",
    "the new aspect which arises due to the presence of continuous symmetry is the manifestation of the nambu - goldstone modes@xcite which are identified as pions .",
    "the chiral phase transition has been studied using various effective chiral models of qcd , such as the linear sigma model@xcite with flavor extension@xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio model for effective quark fields@xcite , and the non - linear realization of weinberg as a low energy effecive theory of qcd@xcite .",
    "here we adopt the @xmath0 sigma model which has been originally used in the context of electro - weak phase transition@xcite .",
    "the model has been used by many authors to describe the chiral phase transition at finite temperature in the mean field ( hartree ) approximations @xcite .",
    "we shall extend such descriptions to non - equiibrium situations with the formalism developed in i.    in this paper we first derive a coupled kinetic equations for the chiral condensate and the mesonic quasi - particle excitation and show these equations reduce in equilibrium to the gap equations to determine the masses of the quasi - particle excitations in the hartree approximation .",
    "the solution of these gap equations exhibits a first order phase transition .",
    "this is a well - known generic problem of the mean field approximation which may be remedied by the inclusion of higher order fluctuations@xcite .",
    "it has been known also , however , that such singular behavior of the chiral phase transition is smoothed out also by the introduction of the explicit symmetry breaking so that it generates the observed pion mass in the vacuum . in this work , we also study the effects of the explicit symmetry breaking in the present formalism .",
    "another difficulty associated with the mean field approximation is that the pion quasi - particle excitation becomes massive apparently violating the goldstone theorem @xcite .",
    "this is another generic problem of the hartree approximation .",
    "it has been known that the missing nambu - goldstone modes arise as acoustic collective modes of the excitations @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate this by computing the dispersion relations of the collective excitations of the system near equilibrium from the linearized kinetic equation with respect small deviations of the condensate amplitude and the quasi - particle distributions from their equilibrium values these modes appears in the continuum of the quasi - particle excitations and thus may suffer a collisionless damping ( landau damping ) .",
    "we examine how these nambu - goldstoned modes are affected by the inclusion of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it will be shown that the nambu - goldstone mode becomes a massive excitation in the quasi - particle continuum which turn into un - damped pionic excitation in the high temperature symmetry recovered phase through a kink non - analytically .    in the next section",
    "we extend the formalism developed in i to derive the coupled kinetic equations for @xmath2 component self - interacting fields with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we will show that @xmath2 component meson condensate is described by @xmath2 non - linear klein - gordon equations which contain non - linear interaction terms given in terms of the @xmath2 classical mean fields and @xmath3 component matrix of @xmath2 fluctuating fields .",
    "the quasi - particle degrees of freedom is expressed in terms of a @xmath4 matrix of generalized wigner functions which consists of the ordinary one - body density matrices in diagonal components and `` anomalous '' one - body density matrices in off - diagonal components , each component being @xmath3 matrix of @xmath2 component fields .",
    "for the long wavelength excitations , the equations of motion of the diagonal components of the generalized wigner functions are shown to reduce to the landau - vlasov - type kinetic equations for the quasi - particle distribution function with a source / sink term expressed in terms of the off - diagonal components of the generalized wigner functions .",
    "kinetic equations similar to ours have been derived for dilute cold atomic gases in @xcite .    in section 4 , uniform static solutions of these coupled kinetic equations",
    "are shown to reproduce the well - known hartree equilibrium solutions at finite temperature which exhibit the first order chiral phase transition .",
    "all off - diagonal components of the generalized wigner function vanish in equilibrium and the @xmath2 diagonal components give thermal distributions of the @xmath2 kinds of quasi - particles , one being sigma - like and other @xmath5 pion - like modes .    in section 5 , we apply our coupled kinetic equations to compute the dispersion relations of the collective excitations near equilibrium . by linearizing the kinetic equations with respect to a small deviations from the static , uniform equilibrium solution we derive a set of self - consistency conditions to determine the dispersion relation of the collective mode .",
    "it will be shown that the fluctuation of the diagonal components of @xmath3 matrix are all coupled and give dispersion relation of sigma - like collective mode while pion - like collective modes are contained in the off - diagonal fluctuations of the wigner functions .",
    "the missing nambu - goldstone modes are retrieved in these pion - like collective modes as acoustic modes by making use of the self - consistency conditions to determine the condensate in equilibrium .",
    "we examine how these collective modes are modified when the chiral symmetry is not exact at the end of this section .",
    "a short summary of this work is given in the last section together with some open problems .",
    "the explicit expression of our kinetic equations in @xmath0 model are given in the appendix .",
    "in the previous paper@xcite , we discussed coupled kinetic equations for one - component real scalar field , which has no continuous symmetry . in order to apply for more realistic physical situation",
    ", we need to extend the model to @xmath0 symmetric linear sigma model which possess continuous symmetry .",

    "recently , a modified self - consistent hartree approximation in finite temperature scalar field theory has been proposed in the context of chiral phase trantsion@xcite and bose - einstin condensation@xcite .",
    "although quasi - particle continuum may be modified by these more sophisticated version of the hartree approximation we expect some features may remain unchanged by such improvements .",
    "the collision terms is needed to describe relaxation phenomena accompanied by entropy production@xcite .",

    "it is interesting to see how our `` collisionless '' pion mode is converted to the son - stephanov pion mode@xcite which is an isospin counterpart of the hydrodynamic spin wave@xcite .",
    "our present formalism emphasizes the role of the mesonic mean field in the final state interaction .",
    "we like to apply our formalism to the kinetic freeze - out dynamics in consideration for the effect of the expansion of the system and solve the space - time evolution of the condensate assuming boost invariance of the system .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the vlasov term might generate strong flow effect due to the gradient of pionic mean field .",
    "this question may be studied by the method developed in this work .",
    "one of the important features of our formalism is that it can describe the chiral phase transition both in equilibrium and far out of equilibrium , including freeze - out process into free streaming particles , in a unified fashion .",
    "this is desirable for extracting observable consequence of the chiral phase transition to confront with experiments of high energy heavy ion collisions which are very complex non - equilibrium phenomenon .",
