    "concept of a phase sensitive parametric amplifier ( psa ) was formulated several decades ago @xcite . the parametric interaction in a psa involves three fields with a well - defined mutual phase relationship .",
    "the gain experienced by one of those fields is maximized when it is in - phase with the other two fields ; this field is de - amplified when its phase is changed by @xmath4 radians .",
    "the difference between maximum and minimum gain is defined as the phase - sensitive extinction ratio ( pser ) .",
    "the noise accompanying the amplification process is squeezed in one quadrature and the noise figure can , in principle , reach a value of unity ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "every psa requires a preparatory stage of some kind @xcite where the mutual phases of the fields are properly arranged .",
    "the fundamental concept of a psa gained significant attention in recent years as systems using phase encoded signals started to dominate fiber optic communications .",
    "indeed , psas were used in several experiments where low noise amplification and phase noise regeneration were demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the use of a psa in quantum optics where phase correlated spontaneous photons are used for quantum information processing has also been suggested @xcite .",
    "most psa demonstrations made use of optical fibers .",
    "nonlinear interactions in fibers are well understood ; they can carry high optical powers needed for the parametric interactions and they are naturally integrated in fiber communication systems .",
    "the disadvantage of optical fibers is their low nonlinearity which requires long interaction lengths and hence special operating conditions have to be applied to prevent stimulated brillouin and raman scattering .",
    "an attractive alternative to fiber based psas are compact waveguide devices with large nonlinearities stemming from the materials used and the small cross sections .",
    "a signal - degenerate psa was demonstrated in a @xmath6 long chalcogenide ridge waveguide @xcite with @xmath7 pulses and a total pump peak powers of @xmath8 , yielding a pser of @xmath3 .",
    "a similar device was used in the pump - degenerate configuration @xcite and achieved a higher pser of @xmath9 with a @xmath10 peak pulse pump power . a @xmath11 long silicon waveguide with a reverse - biased pin junction @xcite reached pser values between @xmath3 and @xmath12 with total peak pump powers of @xmath13 .",
    "the pin junction served to sweep out free carriers generated by two - photon absorption ( tpa ) thereby reducing losses and increasing the nonlinear efficiency .",
    "a recent report of a @xmath14 long sige ridge waveguide @xcite demonstrated a pser of @xmath15 for total pump powers of only @xmath16 .",
    "since every parametric process is governed by phase matching , dispersion control is a key feature .",
    "photonic crystal waveguides ( pcws ) , in particular dispersion engineered pcws @xcite are therefore ideal media for any parametric amplifier .",
    "a psa based on a pump degenerate configuration in a short , @xmath17 , silicon dispersion engineered pcw was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "tpa limited operation even for such a short length so that a peak pulse pump power of @xmath18 was needed to reach a pser of @xmath3 .",
    "refractive index changes due to tpa induced free carriers were also clearly observed .    in this paper",
    ", we report a psa comprising a @xmath0 long @xmath1 dispersion engineered pcw .",
    "the advantage of @xmath1 is its large bandgap which prevents tpa at @xmath19 and hence requires lower pump powers than similar silicon waveguides .",
    "indeed , such a waveguide availed the first phase insensitive parametric amplifier which provided an @xmath20 gain in a @xmath21 waveguide with a peak pump power of less than @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the present psa uses a signal degenerate configuration and exhibits a pser of @xmath3 with total peak pump powers of less than @xmath2 .",
    "the experimental results were confirmed by a simulation using the split step fourier transform ( ssft ) numerical scheme .",
    "the device we tested consists of a @xmath23 thick @xmath1 membrane with air holes patterned in a hexagonal grid .",
    "dispersion engineering @xcite is obtained by shifting asymmetrically the two innermost rows next to the core , and also changing the radius of the holes closest to the core .",
    "tapered mode converters are formed at the input and output facets to increase the coupling efficiency and to prevent reflections .",

    "the amplitude and phase of each pulse is controllable so that a signal - degenerate spectrum can be formed .",
    "each pulse is approximately @xmath28 wide with the signals at the longest and shortest wavelengths serving as pumps .",

    "the edfa operated at a gain level of @xmath34 which yielded a peak power for each pump of @xmath35 , namely the total peak pump power was @xmath36 .",
    "the sps changed the signal phase from @xmath37 to @xmath38 rad in increments of @xmath39 rad .",

    "some degree of phase sensitive fwm takes place in the edfa affecting the signal pulse shape and spectrum at the pcw input .",

    "time domain measurements of the signal pulses at the input and output of the pcw are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulses](a)-[fig : pulses](b ) .",
    "the @xmath42 walk - off between the signal and pumps is small compared to the @xmath28 width of each pulse and has little effect on signal distortion .",
    "the change in output signal pulse shape is due to the parametric gain dependence on the pump pulsed profile : ( de-)amplification of the pulse center more than the tails causes ( broadening ) compression of the signal profile . using cw or quasi - cw pumps can diminish signal distortions and improve bandwidth limitation .",

    "the integration is performed over an oscilloscope span of less than @xmath45 ( to account for the low duty - cycle of the pulse train ) .",
    "the pcw input and output coupling losses were determined to be @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",

    "we note that for large peak pump powers , the minimum signal gain may be lower than shown in the figure since the lowest measurable signal level was limited by the receiver noise .    measured phase - dependent net gain ( dots ) with interpolated curves , for different total peak pump powers .",

    "the nonlinear parameter at @xmath32 was evaluated as @xmath49 using the model detailed in @xcite . the small , @xmath33 , detuning between pumps and signal changes @xmath50 insignificantly so that the standard ssft method suffices and a more accurate but cumbersome technique @xcite is not needed .",
    "different initial signal phase values yield a calculated cyclical gain from which the maximum gain and pser were computed .",
    "an optimization procedure for the input power of the waves and the exact loss level ( which has many random spectral features ) yielded the best fit to experiments when the input and output coupling losses were @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",

    "[ fig : measured - gain ] .    the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : measured - gain ] show an asymmetry and differ from the theoretical logarithmic cosine dependence of the gain on the signal phase @xcite .",
    "indeed the latter is deduced for a theoretical scenario assuming undepleted pumps and a weak signal , a condition not fully satisfied here . moreover , prior to entering the pcw the three emitted waves propagate in an edfa and through additional dispersive components so the input phases of the two pumps may not be the same . finally , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](b ) , the additional idler waves also contribute to the asymmetry and reduce the the overall interaction between the two pumps and the signal @xcite .",
    "the simulations show a slight asymmetry , yet some of the parasitic effects are not considered and reconstruction of the experimental results is imperfect .",
    "the measurements were repeated for a signal wavelengths of @xmath51 with both pump detunings set once more to @xmath33 .",
    "the waves propagate in this case in the normal dispersion regime , where both the inherent losses and the nonlinearity are larger ( @xmath52 ) .",

    "a signal - degenerate configuration with two equally detuned pumps produces pser of @xmath3 with total pump peak powers of only @xmath2 .",
    "the moderate required pump power is strictly due to the wide bandgap of @xmath1 which prevents tpa .",
    "higher pser may be obtained with higher pump powers , however , membrane structures tend to damage at high power and therefore the peak pump powers in the present experiments were limited",
    ". moreover , even though the absolute maximum net gain is moderate , this experiment proves that mode squeezing takes place which can be used for phase regeneration of noisy signals in phase encoded coherent communication .",
