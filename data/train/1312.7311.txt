    "nowadays , modifying the law of gravity is a possible way to explain the acceleration mechanism of the universe @xcite .",
    "various theories are developed to explain some characteristics and properties of the dark energy , known as the responsible of the expanded acceleration of the universe , but it is not clear which king of modified theory of gravity will finally prevail and attention has to be attached to each one .",
    "this paper is devoted to the some cosmological studies in the so - called @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "this theory takes its origin from the fact the cosmological constant may be taken as a trace dependent function , the so - called  @xmath3 gravity \" in order to guarantee the interaction between the de and the ordinary content of the universe , and this is favoured by the recent cosmological data @xcite .",
    "this later has been extended viewing the algebraic function that characterizes the lagrangian density as functions of both the ricci @xmath1 scalar and the trace @xmath2 of the energy momentum tensor , namely , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the dependence on @xmath2 may be a consequence of the universe being partially filled by an exotic imperfect fluid , or consequence of quantum effects coming from conformal anomaly .",
    "several works have been developed in the framework of this kind of modified theory of gravity and considerable results have been found @xcite-@xcite . however ,",
    "anywhere , these theories took into account the important aspect of guaranteeing the conservation of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "this feature has been first undertaken by alvarenga and collaborators @xcite where they consistently ensured the conservation of the energy momentum tensor , from which they constructed a @xmath0 model . in that paper",
    ", they investigate the dynamics of scalar perturbation within the obtained model and focused they attention to the sub - hubble modes , and showed that through the quasi - static approximation the results are very different from the ones derived in the frame of the concordance @xmath4 model , constraining of the validity of this kind of model .    the result obtained in that paper is quite reasonable due to the choice of the ordinary matter content and the determination of the integration constant .",
    "these factors strongly influenced the result in that paper and as our goal in this paper , we propose to keep the ordinary matter , not only as the non - relativistic one as performed in @xcite , but as a mixture of non - relativistic matter ( dust ) and relativistic matter ( radiation ) , despite the current low proportion of this latter . rather than studying the dynamics of scalar perturbations , we will focus our attention to the cosmological dynamic in the low - redshift and high - redshift regimes .",
    "moreover the stability of de sitter and power - low solutions within the model under consideration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] we construct the model consistent with the vanishing divergence of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "the stability of the critical points of the dynamics system are checked in the sec .",
    "[ section3 ] and the one of the perturbation functions within the model under consideration is developed in the sec .",
    "[ section4 ] . the sec .",
    "[ section5 ] is devoted to the study of the cosmological dynamics with the considered model .",
    "the conclusion is presented in the sec .",
    "[ section6 ] .",
    "we start this work writing the action in the following form @xmath5\\,\\,,\\label{eti1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the curvature scalar and the trace of the energy momentum tensor , respectively , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the gravitation constant . the energy momentum tensor is defined from the matter lagrangian density @xmath8 by @xmath9 by varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath10 , one gets the general equations of motion @xmath11 where @xmath12 is determined by @xmath13 in order to reach the expression of the covariant derivative of the energy - momentum tensor and extract the one of the algebraic function , one perform the covariant derivative of ( [ eti4 ] ) , as @xmath14 = \\nabla^{\\mu}\\big[k^{2}t_{\\mu\\nu}- f_{t}(t_{\\mu\\nu}+\\theta_{\\mu\\nu})\\big ] , \\label{eti5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be rewritten as @xmath15 by evaluating the forth term of the above expression , one gets @xmath16 from the above equation , one gets the following expression @xmath17 .\\label{eti8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by assuming that the matter content of the universe is a perfect fluid , one can write the energy momentum tensor as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the energy density and the pressure of the ordinary matter , respectively , @xmath21 is the four - velocity such that @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the lagrangian density may be chosen as @xmath23 , and the tensor @xmath24 . then , after some elementary transformations , eq .",
    "( [ eti8 ] ) takes the following expression @xmath25 \\partial_{\\mu}\\rho\\right\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the barotropic equation of state @xmath26 . by setting @xmath27 ,",
    "one gets @xmath28\\right\\}.\\label{eti11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to ensure a null divergence of the energy momentum tensor , one has to vanish the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eti11 ] ) , leading to the differential equation @xmath29 whose general solution reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are integration constants . in what follows ,",
    "we assume @xmath33 and search for @xmath31 through initial conditions .",
    "we then assume that at the present time @xmath34 the @xmath0 model recovers the @xmath4 one , i.e. , @xmath35 . in this paper",
    ", we propose to work will the model @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , one gets the algebraic function @xmath37 as @xmath38 meaning that the constant @xmath31 depends on the cosmological constant @xmath39 , the parameter of ordinary equation of state @xmath40 and the current trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath41 as @xmath42",
    "we consider the universe is filled by two interacting fluids , the dark energy and the ordinary matter whose energy density are respectively @xmath43 and @xmath19 .",
    "this means that the energy corresponding to each fluid is not conserved and the semi - continuity equations of continuity are written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the term of interaction between the two fluids .",
    "let us define the following cosmological density parameters @xmath46 by using the @xmath47-folding parameter @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the scale factor , the equations of continuity @xmath50 and @xmath51 are presented as a system : @xmath52- \\frac{e_1}{3h^3 } , \\label{3}\\\\ \\frac{dv}{dn}= 3v[(v-1)(1+w_{d})+v(1+w)]+ \\frac{e_1}{3h^3 } \\label{4}\\ , , \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assumed @xmath53 .",
    "the critical point are found by setting @xmath54 considering that the interaction term @xmath55 with @xmath56 a constant , one gets @xmath57 - 3qu = 0 ,   \\label{a6}\\\\   3v[(v-1)(1+w_{d})+u(1+w)]+ 3qu = 0 .",
    "\\label{a7 }   \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after a resolution we find the following critical points @xmath58 the critical point @xmath59 seems reasonable and it is about it we will perform the study of stability .",
    "then , we consider a perturbation in the vicinity of this point and write the variable @xmath60 and @xmath61 as @xmath62 therefore , the system becomes @xmath63\\delta{u}+3u_{c}(1+w_{d})\\delta{v},\\label{5}\\\\ \\frac{d\\delta{v}}{dn}=3[v_{c}(1+w+q)\\delta{u}+3[(2v_{c}-1)(1+w_{d})+(1+w)u_{c}]\\delta{v},\\label{6 } \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] regarding the critical point @xmath59 the eigenvalues are found as @xmath64 it is easy to see that for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are positives .",
    "hence , the point @xmath59 is unstable . for @xmath69 @xmath70 , @xmath71 or @xmath72 , @xmath59 is saddle point . for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ,",
    "@xmath59 is stable ( an attractor ) .",
    "we present the evolution of the variable @xmath60 and @xmath61 versus the @xmath77folding parameter @xmath78 as well as the space phase for some suitable values of the input parameters consistent with the observational data , and presented at fig .",
    "we see from this figure that the interaction case , as the energy density of the ordinary matter decreases and becomes very small , the one of the dark energy goes increases and goes toward @xmath79 as the time evolves .",
    "this is quite reasonable because from observational data , the current universe is well dominated by the dark energy . on the other hand , regarding the graph of @xmath61 versus @xmath60 , it is clear that the critical point about which the stability is studies is a saddle point .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < \" , ]      in this subsection we search for the viability of the model for very small values of the scale corresponding to high - redshift , @xmath80 , ( the era of nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "in such a situation , one can minutely fix the initial value of @xmath78 at that for which @xmath81 , that is @xmath82 .",
    "let us illustrate this by first writing the first generalized friedman equation as @xmath83,\\label{eti52}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 it is easy to see that for times close to the current one , that is , @xmath85 , the algebraic function @xmath37 goes toward @xmath86 such that @xmath87 and the right hand side of ( [ eti52 ] ) gives @xmath88 .",
    "now , at high - redshift , i.e. , for small scale factor , so , negative @xmath78 , one can explore the evolutions of the same parameters as performed in the above case ( the low - redshift ) . at the same time , we need to be more realist taking into account the physical aspect of the universe .",
    "it is important to note that for high - redshift , the universe lives in plank era when the universe is practically filled by radiation . considering that all this happens in the first planck time , where the nucleo - synthesis is starting",
    ", we can set the initial conditions to @xmath89 for the matter and @xmath90 .",
    "as it is well known , as the universe expands , it evolves becoming cool and the @xmath91 known as the elementary particle gives rive to all matter we see today through the recombination process .",
    "if @xmath92 is widely accepted to describe to universe , mainly at it present stage , we try to go toward early times and analyse the deviation of the model under consideration in this paper , with the @xmath4 one . to do so",
    ", we plot the right hand side of ( [ eti52 ] ) and compare it numerically with the @xmath4 for high - redshift .",
    "the result is presented at the fig .",
    "this result shows that the model under consideration is this paper reproduces the @xmath39 behaviour for small scale factor .",
    "indeed , this result was expected because for high - redshift , the radiation is predominant and the effective parameter of equation of state @xmath94 is about @xmath95 . in such a situation ,",
    "the trace @xmath2 of the energy momentum tensor vanishes and the @xmath4 model should be recovered .",
    "therefore , the model also works very for the early moment of the universe .",
    "however , as the universe evolves , the @xmath0 model starts differing slightly from the @xmath4 one .     from @xmath4 model .",
    "the graph are plotted for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , width=340,height=340 ]",
    "we undertook in this work cosmological analysis about a model in the framework of the so - called @xmath0 theory . in order to obtain a viable @xmath0 model ,",
    "we first impose the covariant conservation of the energy momentum , from which , we get a model of the king @xmath36 , being a sort of trace depending function correction to the general relativity .",
    "the obtained model includes parameters depending on the cosmological constant @xmath39 and the parameter @xmath40 of the ordinary equation of state .",
    "these parameters play a main role in the whole study developed in this manuscript . by the way , we study the dynamics of the cosmological system , analysing the stability about the critical points .",
    "our result shows that for both de sitter and power - law solutions , the perturbations functions converge traducing the stability of the model .",
    "moreover , the stability of the model is checked within the de sitter and power - law solutions by performing linear perturbation about the physical critical point .",
    "we see that for the both considered solutions , the model presents stability through the convergence of the geometric and matter perturbation functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    regarding the cosmological dynamics , we search",
    "how much the model may describe the early and present stages of the universe by studying how much it is consistent in both the low - redshift and high - redshift regimes .",
    "the results present consistency with the cosmological observational data .",
