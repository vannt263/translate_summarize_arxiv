    "single atomic ions trapped in an rf paul trap@xcite and atomic ensemble trapped in an optical lattice@xcite are the most two primary approaches of optical clock experiments .",
    "it has been demonstrated that optical clock frequency measurement had a fractional uncertainty of 10@xmath3 in systems based on @xmath0al@xmath1 , @xmath4yb@xmath1 , @xmath5sr and @xmath4yb atoms respectively.the @xmath0al@xmath1 clock based on the @xmath6s@xmath7-@xmath8p@xmath7 transition is stable enough as a reference for an optical clock @xcite .",
    "the natural linewidth of @xmath8p@xmath7 state is 8mhz and the measured transition frequency is 1121 015 393 207 851(6 ) hz @xcite , which means @xmath0al@xmath1 has a higher stability at the same feedback velocity compared to other ions , such as @xmath2ca@xmath1,@xmath4yb@xmath1 and so on . both the @xmath6s@xmath7 and @xmath8p@xmath7 energy levels exhibit only a weak dependence on the magnetic fields for the zeeman effect with angular momentum j=0@xcite . as well as it is insensitive to electric field gradients .",
    "moreover , blackbody radiation shift of this transition is 8(3)e-18 at room temperature@xcite .",
    "however , since it is not easy to acquire the direct cooling laser ( 167 nm ) , @xmath0al@xmath1 is performed sympathetic cooling with a simultaneously trapped ion and readout spectrum with quantum logic spectrum ( qls)@xcite .",
    "@xmath2ca@xmath1 is one of the popular ion species in optical standard and quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "the lasers applied to @xmath2ca@xmath1 can be acquired from external cavity diode laser , which is simpler and stability .",
    "we choose @xmath2ca@xmath1 as our frozen species .",
    "sympathetic cooling system includes target and frozen species which are interacting with each other .",
    "the temperatures of these two species are very low because frozen species can be laser cooled to low temperature and target species interact or collide with frozen species to transfer energy with them .",
    "effectiveness of sympathetic cooling is with strong dependence on the initial energy@xcite .",
    "sympathetic cooling is one significant technique in quantum information processing ( qip)@xcite , cold molecules@xcite , optical frequency standard@xcite and chemical reactions at very low temperatures[19 ] .    here , using a new design of atom oven could generate low velocity , the @xmath2ca@xmath1 -@xmath0al@xmath1 ion pair was synthesized rapidly and effectively .",
    "the mean time of sympathetic cooling by @xmath2ca@xmath1 was about 330s , as the low initial energy made it easy to be trapped and cooled .",
    "the secular motion frequency ratio of @xmath2ca@xmath1 -@xmath0al@xmath1 ion pair and @xmath2ca@xmath1 has been measured in our trap , which fitted well with theoretical calculation .",
    "the experiment setup is shown in fig.[setup2 ] .",
    "a linear paul trap was made of stainless steel with a dimension of 2r@xmath7=1.6 mm and 2z@xmath7=5 mm to confine ions .",
    "a radiofrequency ( rf ) voltage at the frequency 17.128 mhz was applied to bladelike electrodes a and the other pair bladelike electrodes b were rf grounded .",
    "the endcap electrodes were with dc voltage ( fig.[setup2](b ) ) .",
    "@xmath2ca oven and @xmath0al oven were placed under the electric shield stage with an angle of 25@xmath9 angle to prevent calcium or aluminum atom from adhering to the electrodes which may cause the electric field of ion trap change .",
    "the ion trap was enclosed in a uhv chamber ( 3e-8pa ) evacuated by a 75l / s ion pump ( fig.[setup2](a ) ) .",
    "the external - cavity diode laser of 423 nm and led of 395 nm were used to photo - ionization of @xmath2ca , moreover the 394 nm laser served as @xmath0al photo - ionization laser .",
    "the @xmath2ca@xmath1 was doppler cooled by 397 nm and 866 nm lasers .",
    "the @xmath2ca@xmath1 fluorescence was detected by pmt and emccd .",
    "fig.[setups2](c ) shows the energy level of @xmath0al .",
    "we designed 20 mm length stainless steel tube oven with diameter 1.5 mm , and thickness 0.1 mm to generate @xmath2ca and @xmath0al atoms . in experiment",
    "only @xmath2ca atom signal was detected .",
    "the relation between temperature and the current applied to oven have been measured with thermos couple in vacuum chamber ( 0.1pa ) .",
    "the temperature of stainless steel tube oven is only 600@xmath10c at 11a current .",
    "since the saturated vapor pressure of @xmath0al is very low , the @xmath0al must be heated high than 700@xmath10c the atom signal could be detected .",
    "for above reason a ceramics tube oven was designed to supersede the traditional stainless oven .",
    "the oven included two ceramic tubes and tungsten wire .",
    "one ceramics tube was spiral winded with tungsten wire . and both embedded in another ceramics tube(fig .",
    "[ setups](b ) ) .",
    "the temperature of new oven was also measured and the result was displayed in fig .",
    "[ ovens ] .",
    "temperature of ceramics oven is obvious high compared to stainless steel oven at the same current and the time of heating to 700@xmath10c is about 2 minutes .",
    "@xmath2ca@xmath1(@xmath0al@xmath1 ) was generated by photo ionization neutral calcium ( aluminum ) atom beam , which could reduce the impaction of stray electric field .",
    "the specific number of ions were obtained by controlling the time of heating calcium ( aluminum ) oven at about 300@xmath10c(700@xmath10c ) .",
    "after several minutes later the ions was loaded in the ion trap one by one .",
    "it was necessary to block the photo - ionization laser after loading ions because the oven was still with high temperature after shutting down the current .",
    "after @xmath2ca@xmath1 was trapped in the ion trap , the current was applied to the aluminum oven and illuminated 394 nm laser with 500@xmath11w power to insert @xmath0al@xmath1 to the @xmath2ca@xmath1 chain .",
    "the rf power and endcap voltage must be reduced because the temperature of ions was high at the same time when @xmath0al@xmath1 generated .",
    "several minutes later the position of @xmath2ca@xmath1 in the ccd shifted which indicated that dark ion was trapped .",
    "the number of dark ions could be diagnosed by ions distance because the distances of neighboring ions is related to the number of ions , it has no relation with ion species as long as they are singly charged .",
    "and the ions hopped back and forth between different axial positions when low dc voltages applied to the endcaps .",
    "the different positions of @xmath2ca@xmath1 were imaged with ccd , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ionchains ] . by adding several of such images together",
    ", it could be showing the ions at all different positions .",
    "and then the dark ions number is confirmed .",
    "sympathetic cooling process as a sequence of successive coulomb collisions between the particles transfers momentum from the target ion to the frozen ion held at low temperature by laser cooling .",
    "the time ( @xmath12 ) needed from cooling ion cloud to crystal state is[15 ] : @xmath13 where e@xmath7 and @xmath14 are the initial energy of target ion and the oscillating frequency .",
    "the m@xmath15 and m@xmath15 correspond to the mass of frozen and target ion .",
    "the @xmath12 is with strong dependence on the initial energy .",
    "the statistics of @xmath12 from 36 numbers of evens is shown in fig .",
    "[ ionchains ] . recording the time from heating oven to @xmath0al@xmath1 crystal and then subtracting the time of loading hot @xmath0al@xmath1 , the cooling time was obtained .",
    "mostly , the cooling time was about 330s corresponding to the initial energy was 0.63ev according to fig .",
    "[ statics ] which was lower than that of @xmath0al@xmath1 generated by laser ablation ( 600s)@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the target ion with high initial energy may kick out the frozen ion . in our experiments , it is 80% probability to loading single @xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "the dark ions might be some ions other than @xmath0al@xmath1 because @xmath2ca@xmath1 and @xmath0al@xmath1 can react with background gas to molecular ions , such as cah@xmath1 , alh@xmath1@xcite and so on .",
    "in addition , there are no differences in the ccd image .",
    "thus the mass of dark ions should be measured to know the ions species . to diagnose of the dark ions",
    ", we measured the frequency of vibrational modes of two mixed ion species .",
    "the mode frequency of the ions along axial direction depends on the mass as well as the arrangement of the ions , and can be calculated numerically@xcite , the secular motion frequency for two ions is @xmath16 where @xmath14 and @xmath11 is the secular motion frequency of single ion and the mass ratio , respectively . for @xmath2ca@xmath1-@xmath0al@xmath1 ion pair",
    "the common frequencies are calculated as 1.083 relative to that of two @xmath2ca@xmath1 center - of - mass mode .",
    "the secular motion frequency can be measured by rf resonance@xcite and @xmath2ca@xmath1 ions secular motion sideband spectra[23 ] .",
    "the secular motion excitation mass spectrum along z axial can be measured by applying the characteristic perturbation rf voltages to one of the endcaps . when the frequency is resonant with the secular motion frequency , the ion starts to oscillate along the excited normal mode direction .",
    "then , its amplitude of motion could be determined by the electric field .",
    "and the laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) counts decreases or increases due to the changing doppler width of the cooling transition .",
    "the mass spectrum could be measured precisely using secular motion sideband spectra .",
    "the secular motion sideband spectrum is different when have or not dark ion .",
    "[ frequences ] displays the measurement results by above two methods .",
    "[ frequences](a ) shows pmt counts against with the rf frequency .",
    "the blue line gives the motion resonant spectrums of one @xmath2ca@xmath1 and the red one is the case of @xmath2ca@xmath1-@xmath0al@xmath1 pair .",
    "the @xmath17 are 535 khz and 577 khz respectively . and fig .",
    "[ frequences](b ) is the carrier and secular sideband spectrum .",
    "the secular sideband spectrum of @xmath2ca@xmath1-@xmath0al@xmath1 ion pair was shifted about 40 khz comparing with single @xmath2ca@xmath1 .",
    "we could get the ratio of secular motion frequency 1.078 @xmath180.012 and 1.086@xmath180.02 which fits well with theoretical calculation .",
    "that meant the ion pair obtained was @xmath2ca@xmath1-@xmath0al@xmath1 ion pair .",
    "in this report , @xmath2ca@xmath1-@xmath0al@xmath1 ion pair was synthesized rapidly and effectively by using a novel oven heating .",
    "the average time of sympathetic cooling was about 330s .",
    "in addition , the new designed oven can also be used to be heat other materials evaporated under high temperature .",
    "the drawback of new design oven is that it is possible to load more than one @xmath0al@xmath1 due to unable block the aluminum atom beam immediately .",
    "the dark ion mass was distinguished by the ion mass spectrum which was measured and analyzed by using rf resonance and secular motion sideband spectra .",
    "the rapid and effective synthesis of @xmath2ca@xmath1-@xmath0al@xmath1 ion pair is significance and necessary on progress of @xmath0al@xmath1 quantum logic optical clock in the near future .",
