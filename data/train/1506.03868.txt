    "polarized radio emission was detected in the jet of hh 80 - 81 @xcite .",
    "therefore , an interesting question to answer is how jets with velocities of several hundreds km s@xmath1 moving into a dense medium are able to produce shocks where particles can be accelerated up to relativistic energies and produce synchrotron radio emission .",

    "the extended feature observed at @xmath122 cm , associated with an internal shock , is an artifact produced by the reflective boundary condition imposed along the symmetry axis .",
    "in contrast , the other models ( @xmath123 ) display knotty radio structures produced by the internal shocks .",
    "these knots decrease in brightness with distance from the jet source . model m4 ( @xmath124 ) also shows radio emission in the region behind the main bow shock .",
    "the radio emission of this region in model m5 , which has @xmath125 ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) , results in a lower emission compared with model m4 .    in figure  [ fig:4 ]",
    "the degree of polarization of the synchrotron radiation ( @xmath126 ) shows an important result .",
    "models m1-m3 exhibit a high degree of polarization of the synchrotron emission while model m4 displays strong variations toward the symmetry axis .",
    "this behavior is also observed in model m5 , although to a lesser degree .",
    "these results can be understood considering that , in an helical magnetic field , emission from regions with linearly polarized synchrotron radiation whose polarization directions are orthogonal to each other cancel out when the emission is integrated along a los nearly perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of jet .",
    "a decrease of the degree of polarization has been observed in the jet associated with hh 80 - 81 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] displays maps of the distribution of the position angle of the magnetic field @xmath127 , as in observational studies , these @xmath127 s maps were performed from the synthetic maps of the stokes parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 , by using of equations ( [ factorq ] ) , ( [ factoru ] ) , and ( [ chipol ] ) .",
    "these maps show that for models m4 and m5 , which display variations in the degree of polarization , the orientation of the magnetic field in the plane of the sky has a component parallel to the symmetry axis ( given an additional support of the helical nature of the magnetic field ) , while in models m1-m3 the magnetic field is mostly perpendicular to it .",
    "a comparison between synchrotron and thermal x - ray emission for models m3 and m4 is shown in figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "for both models , the x - ray emission maps also display a knotty structure although less defined than its radio counterpart .",
    "most of the thermal x - ray emission comes from the environment material swept up by the main bow shock , as shown by in hydrodynamic simulations . as it was mentioned above for the map of the linearly polarized intensity , the total synchrotron emission maps display bright knots close to the central source .",
    "these bright knots emit a radio flux , at 5 ghz , of the order of @xmath128 , which is ( aside of setting the exact value for the fractions @xmath129 and @xmath62 ) in reasonable agreement with the flux reported by @xcite for the knots in hh 80 - 81 ( 1 mjy / beam or @xmath130 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows that the synchrotron emission for the case of a dense and slow jet ( model m6 ) is 30 times lower than the emission for a lighter and faster jet ( model m4 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is important to do a comparison of the magnitude obtained for both the non - thermal and thermal emission mechanisms in radio wavelengths .",
    "the thermal radio - continuum emission is optically thin for the parameters chosen in our simulations is @xmath131 , considering the equation ( 3 ) of @xcite . ] .",
    "therefore , one can compute the ratio of non - thermal to thermal emissivities ( using equation ( 5 ) of @xcite and equation ( [ jsnu ] ) of this paper ) in the bright radio knots of models m4 and m6 ( located at @xmath132  cm and @xmath133 , respectively ) . for model m6",
    "this ratio is @xmath134 at a frequency @xmath135 , while for model m4 the ratio is 1.4 .",
    "thus , a dense and slow jet does produce synchrotron emission , however at a level that is negligible compared to the thermal radio - continuum .",
    "@xcite have shown the existence of polarized radio emission associated with the hh 80 - 81 protostellar jet .",
    "however , this issue has not been studied by hd or mhd simulations .",
    "we present the results obtained from 2.5d mhd simulations of low- and high - density yso jets .",
    "we have considered cases with a constant , and a time - dependent jet ejection velocity .",
    "furthermore , cases in which the magnetic field is toroidal or helical were analyzed .    assuming a population of relativistic electrons which are accelerated within stellar shock jets , we have used standard prescriptions to estimate their synchrotron emission .",
    "our results indicate that while the thermal x - ray emission is dominated by the shocked environment material at the head of the jet , the non - thermal radio emission turns out to be dominated by the jet material inside the internal shocks .",
    "our models show that a jet with a toroidal magnetic field emits synchrotron radiation with a high degree of polarization .",
    "in contrast , models with a helical magnetic field exhibit a decrease on the degree of polarization , in good agreement with observational results @xcite .",
