    "the special features of turbulence in the presence of rotation have attracted the interest of many authors  @xcite . relying on some experiments ,",
    "the methods of study used have ranged from analytic approaches to numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the central theme in rotating fluids is the effect of the coriolis force , which induces anisotropy ( there is a preferred direction , that of the rotation axis ) .",
    "this anisotropy is extreme in the limit of fast rotation , which actually forces the flow to become two - dimensional ( proudman - taylor theorem )  @xcite . in this work",
    "we apply perturbation theory to the randomly forced navier - stokes equation with coriolis force as a model for the turbulent regime of a rotating fluid .",
    "the perturbative study of the ordinary randomly forced navier - stokes equation , in combination with the renormalization group ( as an improvement of perturbation theory ) , has a long tradition  @xcite .",
    "the addition of the coriolis force , induced by the rotation of the fluid , introduces one additional parameter , the angular velocity @xmath0 or , in dimensionless form , either the rossby or ekman numbers ( in addition to the reynolds number )  @xcite .",
    "let us focus on the ekman number , @xmath1 , that depends on the viscosity @xmath2 and a scale @xmath3 , roughly associated with the size of the fluid system .",
    "the ekman number gives the relative importance of the viscosity and coriolis forces .",
    "we will _ assume _ henceforth that for small @xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) the turbulence is isotropic and the only relevant parameter is the viscosity .",
    "in this limit , the results of the study of the ordinary randomly forced navier - stokes equation hold ( the random force is always assumed isotropic ) .    for larger @xmath0 we will encounter new features .",
    "in fact , the only restriction on perturbative correction terms is that they respect the basic _ symmetry _ of the equations , in our case , the axial symmetry about the rotation axis .",
    "we will see that perturbation theory generates new terms fulfilling these symmetry constraints .",
    "therefore , one must find the complete set of allowed terms that can arise in perturbation theory",
    ". we will determine all the terms that can be represented by the components of an axisymmetric `` viscosity tensor '' and , in particular , the ones that arise at first order in perturbation theory .",
    "the part of this `` viscosity tensor '' that is pair - antisymmetric in the indices plays a significant role ; however , it does not lead to dissipation , and therefore , is not truly viscous .    as in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence , we assume that the physical region of study is sufficiently far from the surfaces , where the boundary conditions are imposed , for them not to have any _ direct _ effect , except the presence of the scale @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to ordinary turbulence , this condition only implies that we can have homogeneous turbulence but , due to rotation , it can not be isotropic .",
    "it is pertinent to mention here that the possibility of anisotropic forced turbulence , and precisely with axial symmetry , has already been considered  @xcite . in this reference , however , the authors assume that the breakdown of isotropy occurs through a random force whose two - point correlation function depends on the anisotropy vector @xmath5 .",
    "they derive a renormalized force proportional to second and fourth powers of @xmath5 . in our case",
    ", we will see that the first perturbative correction is linear in @xmath6 , like the coriolis force itself .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : basic+perturbation ] we introduce the randomly forced hydrodynamical equations with rotation .",
    "we assume that the fluid is incompressible and show how to formulate them as a problem of homogeneous but anisotropic incompressible turbulence .",
    "fourier analysis of the turbulent velocity field is used to organize the perturbation expansion  @xcite in subsection  [ sec : fourier ] .",
    "we introduce in subsection  [ sec : response ] the linear response function . unlike the isotropic case",
    ", the coriolis term leads to a _ non - symmetric _ linear response function matrix . in subsection",
    "[ sec : perturbative ] we define the non - linear response function and present its perturbative expansion ( slow rotation ) .",
    "we also compute the first order perturbative correction to the response function , which allows the identification of the ( rotation independent ) effective shear viscosity ( proportional to the cube of the reynolds number ) , and a new anisotropic force . in section  [ sec : effective - tensor ] we write down the most general axially symmetric `` viscosity tensor '' , as the existence of a preferred direction , singled out by the fluid rotation , requires the introduction and use of axisymmetric tensors .",
    "this rank four `` viscosity tensor '' expresses the proportionality between the fluid stress tensor and the rate of strain tensor . in isotropic and homogeneous incompressible turbulence ,",
    "the viscosity tensor depends only on one parameter , the fluid shear viscosity . in the case of rotating turbulence , and for slow rotation , we find that the axisymmetric `` viscosity tensor '' depends on two parameters : the molecular shear viscosity ( coming from the isotropic terms of the `` viscosity tensor '' ) and a new one , that arises from the anisotropic terms in the `` viscosity tensor '' . we also show that this new parameter can be identified as the coefficient of the anisotropic force calculated perturbatively ( in the previous section  [ sec : perturbative ] ) .",
    "having thus established the equivalence between the perturbatively corrected randomly forced navier - stokes equation with coriolis force on the one hand , and a ( newtonian ) rotating incompressible fluid with an effective axisymmetric `` viscosity tensor '' on the other , we proceed , in section  [ sec : effective ] , to discuss some physical consequences of the new terms in the perturbed fluid equations . in subsection",
    "[ sec : axial - force ] we consider the quasi - local force induced by the anisotropic components of the `` viscosity tensor '' and show that it is proportional to the cube of the reynolds number , and that it does not lead to dissipation . in subsection",
    "[ sec : waves ] we study the dynamical effects of this force on the propagation of inertial waves .",
    "we end by discussing our results and proposing further work on the problem of rotating turbulence . in appendix",
    "[ sec : app - diag ] we introduce the diagrammatic representation of the exact navier - stokes equation and the diagram encoding the first order correction to the response function and in appendix  [ sec : app - perturbation ] we present the technical details needed to carry out the perturbative calculation in the slow rotation limit .",
    "we start from the hydrodynamical equations for a fluid with density field @xmath7 , velocity field @xmath8 , pressure @xmath9 , and molecular shear ( tangential ) and bulk kinematic viscosities @xmath2 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the fluid is rotating with constant angular velocity @xmath11 along the @xmath12 axis and that it is subject to an isotropic random forcing _ per unit mass _ @xmath13 .",
    "the mass and momentum conservation equations are    @xmath14 { \\vec \\nabla}({\\vec \\nabla \\cdot { \\bf u } } ) -2{\\bf \\omega \\wedge u } - { \\bf \\omega \\wedge ( \\omega \\wedge x ) } + { \\bf   f } \\ ; , \\label{moment1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the number of space dimensions",
