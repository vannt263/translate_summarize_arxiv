    "electromagnetic problems are often mathematically defined in terms of differential equations and boundary conditions which appear on surfaces limiting the region of interest . here",
    "we may separate two different ways to connect mathematical boundary conditions and a physical structure . in the analytical way one starts from a given physical problem involving a structure of electromagnetic media and",
    "tries to replace existing medium interfaces by boundary conditions for the purpose of simplifying the mathematical problem . in such cases the boundary conditions are approximative . in the synthetic way a desired structure",
    "is mathematically designed in terms of boundary conditions , which raises the question how to realize them in terms of physical media .",
    "this latter way is of concern here .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that any given impedance boundary , defined by boundary conditions of the type # u_z#e = z_s#h on a planar surface @xmath0 with unit normal @xmath1 , can be realized by an interface of a wave - guiding medium defined by medium dyadics of the form = = _",

    "it was shown that the dyadics @xmath4 and @xmath5 transverse to the medium axis can be designed to realize the surface impedance dyadic @xmath6 .",
    "as another example , the db and db boundary conditions on a plane @xcite , respectively defined in terms of normal field components as # u_z#d=0 ,  # u_z#b=0 , and _ z(#u_z#d)=0 ,  _ z(#u_z#b)=0 , have been shown to be realizable in terms of physical structures .",
    "in fact , already in 1959 , it was found that the db boundary can be realized by the interface of a uniaxially anisotropic medium and satisfying @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the db medium has recently found application in the design of cloaking structures @xcite .",
    "for the planar db boundary , originally introduced in @xcite , a realization was found only recently . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a layer of wave - guiding medium , called the quarter - wave transformer , upon a planar db boundary produces db boundary conditions at its interface .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the properties of the wave - guiding medium of spherical symmetry in order to extend the previous results from planar boundaries to spherical boundaries .",
    "the db and db conditions for the spherical boundary take the respective form @xcite # u_r#d = d_r=0,#u_r#b = b_r=0 , and ( # u_r#u_r#d)= _",
    "r(r^2d_r)=0 , d(#u_r#u_r#b)= _ r(r^2b_r)=0 .",
    "bit was shown in @xcite that objects with either db or db boundary conditions with a certain symmetry in their geometry have no backscattering , i.e. , they are invisible for the monostatic radar .",
    "let us consider the spherically symmetric anisotropic medium defined by = = _ r#u_r#u_r + _ t(-#u_r#u_r ) , = = _",
    "r#u_r#u_r + _ t(-#u_r#u_r ) , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constant parameters .",
    "the maxwell equations can be represented in spherical coordinates as @xcite # u_r & r#u _ & r#u _ + _ r & _ & _ + e_r & re _ & re_= -j=#h , # u_r & r#u _ & r#u _ + _ r & _ & _ + h_r & rh _ & rh_= j=#e . expressing the fields in their radial and transverse components as",

    "after elimination of fields , the equations become ( _ r^2 + k_t^2 ) re_=0 , 1(_r^2 + k_t^2 ) re_=0 , 2(_r^2 + k_t^2 ) rh_=0 , 3(_r^2 + k_t^2 ) rh_=0 , 4it is noteworthy that there is no restriction to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 dependence for the fields .",
    "thus , the four field components satisfying  can be expressed in the form f(#r ) = f_+(,)e^-jk_tr + f_-(,)e^jk_tr .",
    "let us omit the dependence on @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the notation .",
    "after solving the transverse field components , the radial fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be obtained from the maxwell equations as b_r= ( _ ( e _ ) - _ e _ ) , brd_r=-(_(h _ ) - _ h _ ) . dr",

    "the radial fields can be obtained by substituting these in and . in view of the db-boundary conditions and ,",
    "let us define modified radial field quantities as @xmath18 = ( _ ( ( re _ ) ) - _ ( re_)),@xmath19 = -(_((rh _ ) ) - _ ( rh _ ) ) .",

    "let us now consider the region between two spherical surfaces , @xmath23 .",

    "the spherical quarter - wave transformer is quite similar to the previously studied planar quarter - wave transformer @xcite .",
    "in particular , the db-boundary conditions can be realized on the spherical surface by applying the transformer layer upon a db boundary whose realization is previously known .    because the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath10 may be freely chosen , the distance between the two spherical surfaces can be made as small as we wish by choosing large values for @xmath35 .",

    "we have used different values of radial permittivity and permeability in order to get an idea on how large radial components of permittivity and permeability are required in approximating the db boundary . note",
    "that , due to the self - dual character of the structure , the scattering pattern is rotationally symmetric , i.e.  e and h planes have the same patterns .    clearly , radial parameter values @xmath72 , @xmath73 yield a poor approximation to the quarter - wave transformer , whence the sphere markedly deviates from one with the db boundary .",
    "however , for larger values of radial permittivity and permeability , the scattering cross sections of the two coated spheres approach to that of the ideal db sphere . the ideal db scattering is computed from an exact mie scattering solution @xcite . from the numerical results it appears that , for larger values for the transverse parameters @xmath35 , lower values of the radial parameters @xmath36 can be accepted for the realization .",
    "furthermore , one may note that , for all parameter values used in the computation , the layered sphere has very small scattering in the backward direction ( @xmath74 ) .",

    "an anisotropic medium with infinitely large axial permittivity and permeability has been called waveguiding medium and its properties in transforming impedance - boundary conditions between two planar interfaces has been studied in @xcite . in @xcite",

    "the theory is verified numerically through volume - integral equation approach by considering scattering from a layered spherical object and comparing with that from an ideal db sphere .",
    "it is seen that the realization approaches the ideal case when the radial parameters of the quarter - wavelength layer grow large .",
