    "at present , the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not well studied in experiments  @xcite . however ,",
    "recently , a number of works devoted to the investigation of these processes in the framework of the different phenomenological models were published  @xcite . on the other hand , in  @xcite it was shown that different modes of the @xmath5 decay can be satisfactorily described in the njl model  @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "the njl model is used for the description of the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the probabilities of the transitions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are calculated .",
    "these transitions are defined by the mass difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks and can be calculated in the framework of the njl model without attraction of any arbitrary parameters .",
    "our results will be compared with the estimates obtained in  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the amplitudes with intermediate vector mesons dominate in the @xmath10 decay .",
    "for calculation of this decay we should first calculate two non - diagonal transitions @xmath11 and @xmath12 within the njl model .",
    "these transitions go through quark loops containing @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "one can see the comparison in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    ".comparison of @xmath34 [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tbl1 ]    the transition @xmath35 takes the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is momentum of the @xmath38 meson .",
    "the @xmath38 meson decay width is defined by two diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] .",
    "rho1    ( 250,100 )    rho2    ( 250,100 )    the first diagram describes the amplitude which contains the @xmath11 transitions in the final state @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined in  @xcite .",
    "the second diagram describes the amplitude containing the intermediate @xmath41 meson @xmath42 where the vertex @xmath43 was defined in  @xcite @xmath44 and @xmath45 mev is the mass of the @xmath46 meson  @xcite .",
    "thus , for branching fractions we get @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "we note that in these calculations we take into account only the ground state of @xmath49 because the decay with the intermediate @xmath50 is suppresed by a large mass of the radial - excited meson .",
    "our estimates coincide with one taken in  @xcite .",
    "these estimates do not contradict known experimental limits  @xcite .",
    "the description of the decay @xmath51 was obtained in  @xcite with satisfactory agreement with current experimental data .",
    "tau1    ( 250,100 )    we use the amplitude from  @xcite with the @xmath8 transitions  ( [ pietatrans ] ) in the final states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) dependence for a rough estimate . ]",
    "@xmath52 where the breit - wigner relation @xmath53 and @xmath54 parameter were defined in  @xcite . for the processes with the intermediate vector meson we get contributions to branching fractions @xmath55    the @xmath56 transition takes the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the electroweak constant .",

    "the @xmath5 decays we should use the extended njl model  @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath67 of the @xmath68 decays can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the transition @xmath69 takes the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the mixing angles , and @xmath73 .",
    "thus , we get the @xmath74 parameter @xmath75 where phase factor @xmath76 are taken similarly  @xcite . the values",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 do not contradict with ones given in  @xcite .",
    "the contributions to the branching fractions from the amplitude  ( [ scalamp ] ) are @xmath79    the expression for the total width is @xmath80 note that there is no interference between the vector and scalar intermediate state contributions .",
    "thus , for branchings we get @xmath81 let us note that our estimations for scalar contributions are much less than ones in previous works .",
    "our calculations are in qualitative agreement with the previous theoretical estimates obtained in  @xcite .",
    "however , the njl model allows us to describe the transitions @xmath8 and @xmath82 using the same methods . as the result",
    ", we can compare the contribution of amplitudes with intermediate scalar and vector mesons from uniform positions .",
    "these calculations show that in the decays @xmath0 and @xmath10 the scalar meson plays a insignificant role .",
    "however , in the decay @xmath83 the processes with intermediate @xmath49 and @xmath84 make contributions comparable with the contributions of intermediate vector mesons .",
    "it is worth noticing that the width of the decay @xmath85 calculated in the njl model is close to the values obtained in  @xcite @xmath86 this confirms the relevance of our expression for the vertex @xmath87 used in  ( [ scalamp ] ) . for the vertex",
    "@xmath88 the expression was used  ( [ a0njl ] ) .",
    "we get the amplitude  ( [ scalamp ] ) by the matching these expressions through propagator of scalar @xmath49 meson .",
    "this contradicts the vdm - like ansatz for the intermediate resonance used in  @xcite @xmath89 on the other hand , if we use this ansatz for a vector to scalar transition taken in  @xcite and calculate @xmath0 with this ansatz then we get by an order of magnitude @xmath90 this estimate for the branching fraction is close to the current experimental limit  @xcite and can be tested in the near future at the high - luminosity @xmath91 colliders in novosibirsk and beijing , for example .",
    "therefore , the problem of relevancy of vector  scalar transition representation can be clarified .",
