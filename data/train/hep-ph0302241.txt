    "the @xmath1 meson first observed by the cdf collaboration at fnal @xcite is expected to be copiously produced in the future experiments at hadron colliders @xcite with facilities oriented to the study of fine effects in the heavy quark interactions such as the parameters of cp - violation and charged weak current mixing .",
    "so , one could investigate the spectroscopy , production mechanism and decay features of @xmath1 @xcite with the incoming sample of several billion events .",
    "in such circumstances , in addition to the current success in the experimental study of decays with the cp - violation in the gold - plated mode of neutral @xmath3-meson by the babar and belle collaborations @xcite allowing one to extract the ckm - matrix angle @xmath4 in the unitarity triangle , a possible challenge is whether one could get an opportunity to extract some information about the ckm unitarity triangle from the @xmath1 physics in a model independent way or not .",
    "the theoretical principal answer is one can do it . indeed",
    ", there is an intriguing opportunity to extract the angle @xmath0 in the model - independent way using the strategy of reference triangles @xcite in the decays of doubly heavy hadrons .",
    "this ideology for the study of cp - violation in @xmath1 decays was originally offered by m.masetti @xcite , independently investigated by r.fleischer and d.wyler @xcite and extended to the case of doubly heavy baryons in @xcite .",
    "let us point out necessary conditions to extract the cp - violation effects in the model - independent way .",
    "1 .   interference .",
    "the measured quantities have to involve the amplitudes including both the cp - odd and cp - even phases",
    "exclusive channels .",
    "the hadronic final state has to be fixed in order to isolate a definite flavor contents and , hence , the definite matrix elements of ckm matrix , which can exclude the interference of two cp - odd phases with indefinite cp - even phases due to strong interactions at both levels of the quark structure and the interactions in the final state .",
    "3 .   oscillations .",
    "the definite involvement of the cp - even phase is ensured by the oscillations taking place in the systems of neutral @xmath3 or @xmath5 mesons , wherein the cp - breaking effects can be systematically implemented .",
    "4 .   tagging .",
    "once the oscillations are involved , the tagging of both the flavor and cp eigenstates is necessary for the complete procedure .",
    "the gold - plated modes in the decays of neutral @xmath3 mesons involve the oscillations of mesons themselves and , hence , they require the time - dependent measurements .",
    "in contrast , the decays of doubly heavy hadrons such as the @xmath1 meson and @xmath6 baryons with the neutral @xmath7 or @xmath8 meson in the final state do not require the time - dependent measurements .",
    "the triangle ideology is based on the direct determination of absolute values for the set of four decays , at least : the decays of hadron in the tagged @xmath7 meson , the tagged @xmath8 meson , the tagged cp - even state can be used , too .",
    "however , their registration requires the detection of cp - even state of @xmath9 , which can be complicated because of a detector construction , say , by a long base of @xmath9 decay beyond a tracking system .",

    "the above triangle - ideology can be implemented for the analogous decays to the excited states of charmed mesons in the final state .",
    "the residual theoretical challenge is to evaluate the characteristic widths or branching fractions .",
    "we address this problem and analyze the color structure of amplitudes .",

    "[ fig:1a ] is given by the factor of @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the characteristic value of wavefunction , the gluon virtuality is determined by the expression @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the masses of the mesons in the initial and final states , respectively , and the virtuality of quark line connected to the virtual gluon is of the order of @xmath56 therefore , @xmath57 therefore , the above @xmath19-corrections can be neglected to the leading order in the @xmath58-expansion .",
    "finally , in this section we have analyzed the color and weak - interaction structures of decay amplitudes and isolate those of the largest magnitude , while the numerical estimates are presented in the next section .",
    "in this section we use the machinery of qcd sum rules @xcite in order to calculate the widths and branching ratios for the gold - plated modes under study .",
    "the calculations of exclusive non - leptonic modes usually involves the approximation of factorization @xcite , which , as expected , can be quite accurate for the @xmath1 , since the quark - gluon sea is suppressed in the heavy quarkonium .",
    "thus , the important parameters are the factors @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the non - leptonic weak lagrangian , which depend on the normalization point suitable for the @xmath1 decays . in this way , we , first , calculate the form factors in the semileptonic transitions @xcite and , second , evaluate the non - leptonic matrix elements in the factorization approach .",
    "we accept the following convention on the normalization of wave functions for the hadron states under study , i.e. for the pseudoscalar ( @xmath61 ) and vector ( @xmath62 ) states : @xmath63 & & \\langle 0|{\\cal j}_\\mu|v\\rangle =   \\epsilon_\\mu\\ , f_v\\,m_v,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 denote the leptonic constants , so that they are positive , @xmath65 @xmath66 is a four - momentum of the hadron , @xmath67 is a polarization vector of @xmath62 , @xmath68 is its mass , and the current is composed of the valence quark fields constituting the hadron @xmath69 in this respect we can easily apply the ordinary feynman rules for the calculations of diagrams , so that the quark - meson vertices in the decay channel are chosen with the following spin structures : @xmath70 then , we get general expressions for the hadronic matrix elements of weak currents in the exclusive decays of @xmath71 and @xmath72 with the definitions of form factors given by the formulae @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 . the form factors @xmath76 are dimensionless , while @xmath77 and @xmath78 has a dimension of inverse energy , @xmath79 is of the energy dimension . in the case of nonrelativistic description for both initial and final meson states",
    "we expect that @xmath80 f^a_0 > 0 , & f^a_+ < 0 , & f^a_- > 0 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] it is important to note that for the pseudoscalar state the hermitian conjugation in ( [ pseudo ] ) does not lead to the change of sign in the right hand side of equation because of the prescription accepted , since the conjugation of imaginary unit takes place with the change of sign for the momentum of meson ( the transition from the out - state to in - one ) .",
    "the same speculations show that the spin structure of matrix element in the quark - loop order does not involve a functional dependence of form factors on the transfer momentum squared except of @xmath79 , so that we expect that the simplest modelling in the form of the pole dependence can be essentially broken for @xmath79 , while the other form factors are fitted by the pole model in a reasonable way .",
    "following the standard procedure for the evaluation of form factors in the framework of qcd sum rules @xcite , in the @xmath1 decays we consider the three - point functions    @xmath81    where @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote the interpolating currents for the final states mesons .",
    "the standard procedure for the evaluation of correlators and form factors is described in @xcite .",
    "the most important notes are the following @xcite :    * for the heavy quarkonium @xmath84 , where the relative velocity of quark movement is small , an essential role is taken by the coulomb - like @xmath85-corrections . *",
    "we have found that the normalizations of leptonic constants for the heavy quarkonia are fixed by the appropriate choice of effective constant for the coulomb exchange @xmath86 , while the stability is very sensitive to the prescribed value of heavy quark mass .",
    "thus , these parameters of sum rules are extracted from the two - point qcd sum rules with a quite good accuracy .",
    "* in the framework of two - point sum rules for the heavy - light channel the fixed value of threshold energy @xmath87 determines the binding energy of heavy quark in the meson , @xmath88 gev , which yields the same value of mass for the beauty quark , @xmath89 gev , as it was determined from the analysis of two - point sum rules in the @xmath90 channel .",
    "however , taking into account the second order corrections in @xmath91 , we find that the mass of charmed quark is shifted to the value of @xmath92 gev in the heavy - light channel in comparison with the @xmath93 states .",
    "thus , in the transition of @xmath1 to the charmed meson we put the mass of spectator charmed quark equal to @xmath92 gev .",
    "* in the framework of the effective theory of heavy quarks with the expansion in the inverse masses of the heavy quarks @xcite , the spin symmetry relations between the form factors in the soft limit of zero recoil momentum can be derived @xcite .",
    "* we take the following ordinary ratios of leptonic constants for the vector and pseudoscalar states and for the heavy - strange mesons : @xmath94 which agree with both the lattice computations @xcite and the estimates in the framework of potential models taking into account relativistic corrections @xcite . *",
    "the leptonic constant of @xmath1 is taken from a scaling relation for the heavy quarkonia @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the above estimates we put the following values of parameters :    * the leptonic constants : @xmath95 * the ckm elements : @xmath96    so that the numbers can be appropriately scaled at other values of input parameters .    in the btev @xcite and lhcb @xcite experiments",
    "one expects the @xmath1 production at the level of several billion events .",
    "therefore , we predict @xmath97 decays of @xmath1 in the gold - plated modes under interest .",
    "the experimental challenge is the efficiency of detection .",
    "one usually get a 10%-efficiency for the observation of distinct secondary vertices outstanding from the primary vertex of beam interaction .",
    "next , we have to take into account the branching ratios of @xmath98 and @xmath7 mesons .",
    "this efficiency crucially depends on whether we can detect the neutral kaons and pions or not .",
    "so , for the @xmath98 meson the corresponding branching ratios grow from 4% ( no neutral @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) to 25% .",
    "the same interval for the neutral @xmath7 is from 11 to 31% .",
    "the detection of neutral kaon is necessary for the measurement of decay modes into the cp - odd state @xmath101 of the neutral @xmath7 meson , however , we can omit this cross - check channel from the analysis dealing with the cp - even state of @xmath102 .",
    "the corresponding intervals of branching ratios reachable by the experiment are from 0.5 to 1.3% for the cp - even state and from 1.5 to 3.8% for the cp - odd state of @xmath7 .",
    "the pessimistic estimate for the product of branching ratios is about @xmath103 , which results in @xmath104 reconstructed events .",
    "thus , an acceptance of experimental facility and an opportunity to detect neutral pions and kaons as well as reliable estimates of total cross section for the @xmath1 production in hadronic collisions are of importance in order to make expectations more accurate .",
    "in this work we have shown how the reference - triangle ideology can be used for the model - independent extraction of ckm - matrix angle @xmath0 from the set of branching ratios of doubly heavy meson @xmath1 exclusively decaying to the neutral @xmath5 mesons .",
    "tagging the flavor and cp - eigenstates of such the @xmath5 mesons allows one to avoid the uncertainties caused by the qcd dynamics of quarks .",
    "we have estimated the characteristic branching ratios in the framework of qcd sum rules , which yields the values of the order of @xmath105 \\approx 5\\cdot 10^{-6}.\\ ] ] accepting the above value , and putting the efficiency of tagging procedure equal to 0.5% for the neutral charmed meson and 4% for the charmed strange meson in the final state as well as the vertex reconstruction efficiency equal to 10% , we can expect the observation of about 10 reconstructed events per year at the lhc collider in such the experiment like lhcb or in btev experiment at fnal .",
