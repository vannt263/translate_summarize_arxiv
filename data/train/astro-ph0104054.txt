    "the black - hole binary grs 1915 + 105  is highly variable in x - rays ( belloni et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "still , even its hardest spectra are relatively soft , consisting of a blackbody - like component and a high - energy tail ( vilhu et al .",
    "they are softer than those of other black - hole binaries in the hard state , which @xmath1 spectra peak at @xmath2 kev ( e.g. , cyg x-1 , gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ) , and are similar to their soft state ( e.g. , cyg x-1 , gierliski et al .  1999 , hereafter g99 ; lmc x-1 , lmc x-3 , wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the blackbody component arises , most likely , in an optically - thick accretion disk . on the other hand",
    ", there is no consensus at present regarding the origin of the tail .",
    "all three main models proposed so far involve comptonization of the blackbody photons by high - energy electrons .",
    "they differ , however , in the distribution ( and location ) of the electrons , which are assumed to be either thermal ( maxwellian ) , non - thermal ( close to a power law ) , or in a free fall onto the black hole .    a discussion of these models is given in zdziarski ( 2000 ) , who shows that the thermal and free - fall models of the soft state of black hole binaries can be ruled out , mostly by the marked absence of a high - energy cutoff around 100 kev in the _ cgro _ data ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ; g99 ; tomsick et al .  1999 ; mcconnell et al .",
    "the present best soft - state model appears to involve electron acceleration out of a maxwellian distribution ( i.e. , a non - thermal process ) , which leads to a hybrid electron distribution consisting of both thermal and non - thermal parts ( zdziarski , lightman & macioek - niedwiecki 1993 ; poutanen & coppi 1998 ; g99 ; coppi 1999 ) .    in this _ letter _ , we present all osse observations of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "we then choose two osse spectra corresponding to the lowest and highest x - ray flux and fit them together with spectra from simultaneous _",
    "rxte _ pointed observations .",
    "the spectra , showing extended power laws without any cutoff up to at least 600 kev , provide strong evidence for the presence of non - thermal comptonization .",
    "more extensive presentation of the combined x - ray / osse data will be given elsewhere .",
    "table 1 gives the log of the 9 osse observations , together with results of power - law fits and basic data about the corresponding x - ray and radio states .",
    "the osse instrument accumulated spectra in a sequence of 2-min .",
    "measurements of the source field alternated with 2-min . , offset - pointed measurements of background .",
    "the background spectrum for each source field was derived bin - by - bin with a quadratic interpolation in time of the nearest background fields ( see johnson et al .",
    "figure [ fig : osse ] shows the osse spectra ( including standard energy - dependent systematic errors ) , which were fitted up to energies at which the source signal was still detected .",
    "the uncertainty for a fitted parameter corresponds hereafter to 90% confidence ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we see that the source went through wide ranges of radio and x - ray fluxes and types of x - ray variability during those observations . in spite of that variety , 8 out of 9 osse spectra",
    "are best - fitted by a power law with a photon index of @xmath4 and the flux varying within a factor of 2 .",
    "the only exception is the osse spectrum corresponding to the highest x - ray flux measured by the asm ( 1999 april 2127 ) , which is much harder , @xmath5 , and has a much lower flux .",
    "we then consider the osse spectra corresponding to the extreme x - ray fluxes measured by the _",
    "rxte_/asm , i.e. , from 1997 may 1420 ( vp 619 ) and 1999 april2127 ( vp 813 ) .",
    "we fit them together with spectra from the pointed _ rxte _ observations of 1997 may 15 and 1999 april 23 ( the observation ids are 20187 - 02 - 02 - 00 , 40403 - 01 - 07 - 00 ; 1% systematic error is added to the pca data with the responses of 2001 february ) .",
    "these pca data correspond to the variability classes ( belloni et al .",
    "2000 ) of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in which the variability is moderate and the source spends most of the time in two basic low ( @xmath8 ) and high ( @xmath9 ) x - ray flux state , respectively .",
    "we fit the data with the xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) model eqpair ( coppi 1999 ; g99 ) , which calculates self - consistently microscopic processes in a hot plasma with electron acceleration at a power law rate with an index , @xmath10 , in a background thermal plasma with a thomson optical depth of ionization electrons , @xmath11 .",
    "the electron temperature , @xmath12 , is calculated from the balance of compton and coulomb energy exchange , as well as @xmath13  pair production ( yielding the total optical depth of @xmath14 ) is taken into account .",
    "the last two processes depend on the plasma compactness , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a power supplied to the hot plasma , @xmath17 is its characteristic size , and @xmath18 is the thomson cross section .",
    "we then define a hard compactness , @xmath19 , corresponding to the power supplied to the electrons , and a soft compactness , @xmath20 , corresponding to the power in soft seed photons irradiating the plasma ( which are assumed to be emitted by a blackbody disk with the maximum temperature , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the compactnesses corresponding to the electron acceleration and to a direct heating ( i.e. , in addition to coulomb energy exchange with non - thermal @xmath13  and compton heating ) of the thermal @xmath13  are denoted as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , and @xmath24 .",
    "details of the model are given in g99 .",
    "= 8.7 cm    we also take into account compton reflection with a solid angle of @xmath25 ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) and an fe k@xmath26 emission from an accretion disk assumed to extend down to @xmath27 ( which results in a relativistic smearing ) .",
    "the equivalent width , @xmath28 , with respect to the _ scattered _ spectrum only is tied to @xmath25 via @xmath29 ev ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the elemental abundances of anders & ebihara ( 1982 ) , an absorbing column of @xmath30 @xmath31 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; vilhu et al .",
    "2001 ) , and an inclination of @xmath32 are assumed .    as discussed in g99 , @xmath33 depends weakly on @xmath20 in a wide range of this parameter .",
    "an increase of @xmath20 leads to increasing @xmath13  pair production , which then leads to an annihilation feature around 511 kev .",
    "the presence of such a feature is compatible with the osse data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : osse ] ) , but only very weakly constrained .",
    "g99 found that @xmath34 provides a good fit to cyg x-1 data . here , we find that a good fit is provided with @xmath35 , compatible with the high luminosity of grs 1915 + 105",
    ". for example , for 1/2 of the eddington luminosity , @xmath36 , and spherical geometry , the size of the plasma corresponds then to @xmath37 .",
    "this model provides very good description of our two broad - band spectra ( as well as of other _",
    "rxte_-osse spectra , s. v. vadawale et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . for vp 619 , we assume a free relative normalization of the hexte and osse spectra with respect to those from the pca . on the other hand",
    ", the hexte spectrum for vp 813 has relatively few counts at its highest energies , and thus we use the actual osse normalization in that fit .",
    "table 2 gives the fit results , and figure [ f : data ] shows the spectra .",
    "= 8.2 cm    our model predicts the power law emission extending with no cutoff well above 1 mev and a weak annihilation feature ( with the plasma allowed to be pair - dominated , i.e. , with @xmath38 , for vp 619 ) .",
    "those predictions can be tested by future soft @xmath7-ray detectors more sensitive than the osse .",
    "we note that the comptel has already detected a power law tail up to @xmath39510 mev in the soft state of cyg x-1 ( mcconnell et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "figure [ f : model]a shows the spectral components of the fit to the vp-619 spectrum .",
    "compton reflection with @xmath40 is detected at a very high significance ( @xmath41 gives @xmath42 , corresponding to the chance appearance of reflection of @xmath43 from the @xmath44-test ) , and it is responsible for the convex curvature in the @xmath3910100 kev spectrum .",
    "figure [ f : model]a also shows that the scattered component has a spectral break at @xmath2 kev but continues as a power law ( with addition of the broad annihilation feature ) above it due to the domination of non - thermal scattering at those energies .",
    "comptonization by the thermal electrons dominates at energies close to the blackbody component and thus pca data of grs 1915 + 105  can be reasonably modeled up to 60 kev by thermal comptonization of a disk blackbody ( vilhu et al .",
    "when the osse data are included , the probability that non - thermal electrons are not present ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) is only @xmath46 . the best - fit thermal compton model shown by the long dashes in figure [ f : model]a strongly underestimates the flux above 100 kev .",
    "the statistical significance of the presence of non - thermal electrons can be further increased by fitting the _ rxte _ spectrum together with the average spectrum from osse , which has virtually identical shape to that of vp 619 , but much better statistics .",
    "then , allowing for @xmath47 reduces @xmath48 from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , which corresponds to the chance probability of @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we strongly rule out the pure - thermal comptonization model .    during the vp 813 ,",
    "compton reflection is statistically not required , as indeed expected at the large @xmath52 of the scattering medium covering the disk ( which would completely smear out any disk reflection and fluorescence features ) .",
    "thus , we set @xmath41 is the fit .",
    "the presence of non - thermal electrons is now required at an extremely high significance ( @xmath53 ) due to the presence of the very distinct hard high - energy tail above the thermally  cut - off spectrum , see figures [ f : data ] , [ f : model]b .",
    "= 8.4 cm    on the other hand , shrader & titarchuk ( 1998 ) have fitted a model of bulk - motion comptonization of blackbody photons to _ rxte _ and batse data from a hard state of grs 1915 + 105  similar to that of vp 619 .",
    "we fit their model ( bmc in xspec ) at a free @xmath54 to our broad - band spectra , and find it is completely unacceptable statistically , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 for vp 619 and 813 , respectively .    however , the _ specific _ feature of bulk - motion comptonization is a high - energy cutoff at @xmath57 kev due to the effects of compton recoil and gravitational redshift close to the black - hole horizon ( e.g.  laurent & titarchuk 1999 ) .",
    "such a cutoff is _ not _ included in the bmc model ( and its inclusion would further worsen the fits above ) .",
    "thus , we use monte carlo results of laurent & titarchuk ( 1999 ) , which include the cutoff , to test whether the osse data ( regardless of the data at lower energies ) are compatible with its presence .",
    "we find that their theoretical spectrum for the accretion rate of @xmath58 matches well the slope of the average osse spectrum at low energies ( the histogram in fig .",
    "[ f : bmc ] ) .",
    "the monte - carlo spectrum can then be very well reproduced by a power law times a step function convolved with a gaussian ( model plabs(step ) in xspec , with the cutoff energy of 150 kev and the gaussian width of 35 kev , the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ f : bmc ] ) .",
    "we see that the osse average spectrum lies well above that model at @xmath57 kev .",
    "quantitatively , the bulk - motion compton model yields @xmath59 . in comparison ,",
    "the power - law and eqpair models yield @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "thus , the bulk - compton model is completely ruled out .",
    "further problems with that model are discussed in zdziarski ( 2000 ) .",
    "= 7.0 cm    also , the commonly used phenomenological models of disk blackbody and either a power law or an e - folded power law give very bad fits to our data .",
    "the latter yields @xmath62 , @xmath63 for vp 619 , 813 , respectively .",
    "in fact , even the thermal part of the vp-813 spectrum is very poorly described by a disk blackbody , with @xmath64 for a fit to the 3.520 kev pca data , whereas the same data are well modeled by thermal comptonization , @xmath65 ( with neither model including a high - energy tail ) .",
    "thus , we find physical models of the spectra of grs 1915 + 105  in terms of thermal and non - thermal comptonization and ( in some cases ) compton reflection to be vastly superior to any other model proposed so far .",
    "we have found that broad - band spectra of grs 1915 + 105  in its two main spectral states ( @xmath9 , @xmath8 ) are very well fitted by comptonization of disk blackbody photons in a ( hybrid ) plasma with both electron heating and acceleration .",
    "the presence of strong reflection indicates the plasma is located in coronal regions ( possibly magnetic flares ) above the disk .",
    "this physical model is the same as that fitted to the soft state of cyg x-1 by g99 .",
    "differences in the variability properties of cyg x-1 and grs 1915 + 105  are likely to be due to the disk being stable in the former case and unstable in the latter , most likely due to its much higher @xmath66 .",
    "the corona is unstable in both cases .",
    "the comptonizing medium in the high-@xmath67 state ( @xmath9 ) is thomson - thick , and it can represent the surface layer of an overheated disk accreting at a super - eddington rate ( beloborodov 1998 ) .",
    "an issue to be addressed by future research is the origin of the hardening of the tail in this state as compared to other ones ( fig .  [",
    "fig : osse ] ) .",
    "our model predicts broad annihilation features , although their strength depends on the unknown size of the plasma .",
    "grs 1915 + 105  was in the power - law @xmath7-ray state in the classification of grove et al .",
    "( 1998 ) during the 9 osse observations .",
    "this state usually corresponds to the high / soft x - ray state .",
    "indeed , x - ray spectra observed so far from grs 1915 + 105(vilhu et al .",
    "2001 ) are substantially softer than those with @xmath68 and a sharp thermal cutoff at @xmath69 kev , characteristic to the hard state of other black - hole binaries .",
