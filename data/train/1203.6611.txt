    "the study of periodic structures from the perspective of rigidity theory has received considerable attention in recent years , due in part to questions raised about the material properties of zeolites .",
    "zeolites are a type of micro - porous mineral whose molecular structure is periodic in nature . since the properties of zeolites are related to their structural properties , it has been a topic of interest to determine theoretically when such a material is rigid or flexible @xcite .    toward this end , there has been a surge of interest in the study of _ periodic frameworks_. a periodic framework is composed of rigid bars linked together periodically to form an infinite repetitive bar - joint framework , that is , rigid bars connected by flexible joints .",
    "this can be described by an infinite graph @xmath1 , together with a group , say @xmath2 , which describes the periodicity of the graph @xmath1 .",
    "together with a periodic placement @xmath3 of the vertices of @xmath1 in @xmath4 , we have a periodic framework @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the periodicity of the framework determines the _ periodic lattice _ , which we may consider as either fixed or variable .",
    "the periodic lattice is generated by the @xmath6 translations under which @xmath5 is invariant .    in the thesis of the author ,",
    "a combinatorial characterization for the _ generic rigidity _ of two - dimensional periodic frameworks with a fixed periodic lattice was presented .",
    "that is , we found combinatorial conditions on a _ periodic orbit graph _ which are sufficient to guarantee the rigidity of _ almost all _ realizations of the graph as periodic frameworks .",
    "subsequent work by malestein and theran @xcite characterized two dimensional periodic frameworks with a variable periodic lattice . unfortunately , like the study of the rigidity of finite graphs , we lack combinatorial tools to predict the generic rigidity of periodic frameworks for @xmath7 .",
    "it is natural , then , that we turn our attention to _ periodic body - bar frameworks _ , which are formed of rigid bodies linked periodically together by bars ( two bodies can be linked by multiple bars , hence body - bar frameworks are captured by multigraphs , in contrast to bar - joint frameworks which are always described by simple graphs ) . in their finite incarnations , body - bar frameworks admit neat combinatorial characterizations for all @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the question then becomes , do periodic body - bar frameworks also have a nice combinatorial characterization ?    in @xcite ,",
    "a complete characterization of periodic body - bar frameworks with a fixed lattice was conjectured by the author . in this paper",
    ", we prove the result for @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 following from the previous bar - joint characterizations @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we show :    @xmath10 is a periodic orbit graph corresponding to a generically minimally rigid body - bar periodic framework in @xmath0 if and only if    1 .",
    "@xmath11 2 .   for all non - empty subsets @xmath12 of edges",
    "@xmath13    the sparsity condition described by condition _ 2 _ depends on the dimension of the _ gain space _",
    "@xmath14 of a set of edges @xmath15 , which , roughly speaking , can be thought of as part of the connectivity information about the periodic framework .",
    "alternatively , @xmath14 describes the way in which the set of edges @xmath15  wrap \" around a torus ( as a model of periodic space ) , and can thus be seen as information about the homotopy type of the edge set @xmath15 .",
    "we mention some very recent related work due to borcea , streinu and tanigawa @xcite . in that paper , the authors find necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions for rigidity on _ unlabelled _ quotient graphs of infinite periodic body - bar frameworks . the work in the present paper",
    "is concerned with _",
    "labelled _ quotient graphs of infinite periodic frameworks . given a particular infinite periodic body - bar framework , this defines a unique ( up to size of unit cell and translation ) labeled quotient graph , which we will call a _ periodic orbit framework_. the analysis of labelled quotient graphs is a harder problem than the analysis of unlabelled ones .",
    "the approach of @xcite will only tell us that a good labelling (  lifting \" ) of the quotient graph exists , but can not predict whether a particular labelling will be good .",
    "that said , the paper @xcite considers @xmath6-dimensional frameworks , and does so with a variable periodic lattice .",
    "that is , strictly speaking , a harder problem to characterize than the fixed lattice considered here . to further differentiate the present work from the recent paper @xcite , the methods used here are inductive methods , while the approach of borcea , streinu and tanigawa is non - inductive .",
    "we conclude this brief introduction by mentioning some reasons why it may be valuable to consider periodic frameworks with a fixed periodic lattice .",
    "it may , at first glance , seem like an unnatural restriction or simplification of the problem of periodic frameworks ( with a variable lattice ) .",
    "however , for frameworks with a variable periodic lattice which are flexible , the vertices which are  far away \" from the  centre \" ( arbitrarily chosen ) are moving arbitrarily quickly .",
    "some materials scientists have suggested that the time scales of lattice movement are several orders of magnitude slower than molecular deformation within the lattice @xcite .",
    "finally , we may also view the fixed lattice as a stepping stone or preview of a full characterization of frameworks with a variable lattice . in particular",
    ", it is possible to view characterizations of frameworks with a variable lattice as consisting of two parts : a component which  rigidifies \" the variability of the lattice , and a second component which is rigid within the resulting fixed lattice .",
    "we provide an extensive background section ( section [ sec : background ] ) which outlines several types of frameworks , and their rigidity .",
    "in particular , we discuss finite bar - joint frameworks , bar - joint periodic orbit frameworks and their corresponding derived periodic ( bar - joint ) frameworks , finite body - bar frameworks , body - bar periodic orbit frameworks and their corresponding derived periodic ( body - bar ) frameworks .",
    "we also describe induced bar - joint frameworks from body - bar frameworks .",
    "section [ sec : barjointinductions ] provides information about rigidity - preserving inductive constructions for three - dimensional bar - joint periodic orbit frameworks . in section [ sec : mainresult ] we state and motivate our main result , and establish the necessity of the characterization .",
    "section [ sec : sufficient ] is the main work of the paper , and details the proof of the sufficiency of the characterization .",
    "we conclude with some conjectures and ideas for further work .",

    "we focus our attention on infinitesimal rigidity , which is sufficient to guarantee the continuous rigidity of a framework in @xmath4 , although the converse is false .",
    "the focus on infinitesimal rigidity is thus a typical way to attack the problem of continuous rigidity , which is computationally challenging .",

    "note that there will always be a @xmath33-dimensional space of trivial solutions of @xmath34 , corresponding to infinitesimal rigid motions of @xmath4 ( translations , rotations ) .",

    "the notion of minimal rigidity also corresponds to the idea of a framework which is _ independent _ , meaning that the rows of the rigidity matrix are linearly independent .",
    "we elaborate on this idea in the subsequent section .",
    "we remark finally that the rigidity of frameworks is a generic property : for almost all configurations @xmath38 of a graph @xmath17 , the framework @xmath26 will be either infinitesimally rigid or infinitesimally flexible .",
    "in particular , we say that a _ generic _",
    "position @xmath38 of the graph @xmath17 is one such that all minors of @xmath34 that have determinants which are not identically zero have non - zero determinant .",
    "this yields an open dense set of generic positions for a given graph @xmath17 .",
    "we say that a graph @xmath17 is _ generically rigid _ if it is infinitesimally rigid at all generic positions @xmath38 .",

    "the vertices of @xmath42 are simply the vertices of the graph @xmath17",
    ". the edges of @xmath42 are recorded @xmath43 , where @xmath44 . since the edges are labeled invertibly by elements of @xmath40",
    ", it follows that the edge @xmath45 can equivalently be written : @xmath46    from the periodic orbit graph @xmath42 , we may define the _ derived periodic graph _",

    "we mean the quotient space @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a @xmath55 matrix we call the _ lattice matrix_. the lattice matrix can be viewed as a set of translations under which a periodic framework is invariant .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated that infinitesimal rigidity is invariant under affine transformations @xcite , and as a result it is sufficient to consider frameworks on the unit lattice ( @xmath56 ) as representatives of all periodic orbit frameworks .",
    "we henceforth use @xmath57 as the fixed torus .",

    ", we know that @xmath225 can be constructed from @xmath372 , and hence @xmath10 can be too .",
    "theorem [ thm : dnecessary ] establishes the necessity of the two conditions for generic rigidity .",
    "suppose @xmath10 satisfies conditions 1 and 2 of our main theorem . by theorem [ thm:16mod ] ,",
    "it can be built up from a single vertex with three looks by a sequence of gain - modified edge pinches . by theorem [ thm : bbpinches ] , these gain - modified edge pinches preserve generic rigidity on @xmath138 , which completes the proof . .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it was previously conjectured that the results of the present paper hold for @xmath6-dimensional body - bar orbit frameworks @xcite .",
    "that is , we claim          it is evident that the approach of the present paper does not immediately extend to this more general conjecture , since we have taken cases in the proofs of propositions [ prop : union ] and [ prop : unionneg ] , which are central to the proof of the main result .",
    "it is possible that some other method may prove useful in establishing the relevant results .",
    "another possibility is that we abandon the approach of fekete and szeg , and prove the result using an entirely different technique . in any case , we believe that the established result is a promising indication that the conjecture is true .",
    "it is possible to check that the expression ( [ eq : gainsparseconj ] ) gives rise to a submodular function on the set of oriented edges labeled by elements of @xmath40 .",
    "it then follows that the body - bar periodic orbit graphs @xmath10 satisfying ( [ eq : gainsparseconj ] ) form the independent sets of a matroid .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "other areas for further research may be the extension of these results to body - hinge frameworks , which provide yet another tool for studying molecular frameworks .",
    "the recent proof of the molecular conjecture @xcite provides further motivation for this avenue of research .",
    "finally , the development of algorithms , based on the pebble game algorithm @xcite for checking whether a given body - bar orbit graph satisfies the sparsity condition of theorem [ thm : main ] would be of interest .",
    "the paper of walter whiteley in this volume @xcite addresses the question of  fragments \" of periodic frameworks .",
    "that is , he considers finite pieces of periodic structures . as part of this set of questions he describes two types of fragments : _ tubes _ and _ slabs_. tubes are three - dimensional structures which are periodic in one direction .",
    "slabs are three - dimensional structures which are periodic in two dimensions .    from the result presented in this paper , it is possible to obtain extensions to tubes and slabs which are not fragments .",
    "tubes can be seen to correspond to periodic frameworks @xmath10 with @xmath378 , and slabs correspond to those frameworks with @xmath379 .",
    "adapting the present results to these contexts is the subject of a forthcoming joint paper .",
