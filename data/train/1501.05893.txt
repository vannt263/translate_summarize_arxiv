    "when managing a portfolio , a trader needs to raise cash in order to finance a number of operations .",
    "those include maintaining the hedge of the position , posting collateral resources , and paying interest on collateral received",
    ". moreover , the trader needs to account for the possibility that the position may be liquidated prematurely due to his own or counterparty s default , hence entailing additional costs due to the closeout procedure .",
    "cash resources are provided to the trader by his treasury desk , and must be remunerated .",
    "if he is borrowing , then he will be charged an interest rate depending on current market conditions as well as on his own credit quality .",
    "such a rate is usually higher than the lending rate at which the trader would lend excess cash proceeds from his investment strategy to the treasury .",
    "the difference between borrowing and lending rate is also referred to as _",
    "funding spread_.    even though pricing by replication can still be put to work under this rate asymmetry , the classical black - scholes formula no longer yields the price of the claim . in the absence of default risk ,",
    "few studies have been devoted to pricing and hedging claims in markets with differential rates .",
    "@xcite considers option pricing in a market with a higher borrowing than lending rate , and derives an interval of acceptable prices for both the buyer and the seller .",
    "@xcite consider the problem of hedging contingent claims under portfolio constraints allowing for a higher borrowing than lending rate .",
    "@xcite study the super - hedging price of a contingent claim under rate asymmetry via nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations ( bsdes ) .",
    "the above studies do not consider the impact of counterparty credit risk on valuation and hedging of the derivative security .",
    "the new set of rules mandated by the basel committee ( @xcite ) to govern bilateral trading in otc markets requires to take into account default and funding costs when marking to market derivatives positions .",
    "this has originated a growing stream of literature , some of which is surveyed next . @xcite and @xcite introduce a bsde approach for the valuation of counterparty credit risk taking funding constraints into account .",
    "he decomposes the value of the transaction into three separate components , the collateral , the hedging assets used to hedge market risk of the portfolio as well as counterparty credit risk , and the funding assets needed to finance the hedging strategy .",
    "an accompanying numerical study was conducted in @xcite .",
    "along similar lines , @xcite first derive a risk - neutral pricing formula for a contract taking into account counterparty credit risk , funding , and collateral servicing costs , and then provide the corresponding bsde representation .",
    "@xcite derives a closed form solution for the price of a derivative contract in presence of funding costs and collateralization , but ignores the possibility of counterparty s default .",
    "moreover , he assumes that borrowing and lending rates are equal , an assumption that is later relaxed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite generalize @xcite s model to include default risk of the trader and of his counterparty .",
    "they derive pde representations for the price of the derivative via a replication approach , assuming the absence of arbitrage and sufficient smoothness of the derivative price .",
    "@xcite develop a general semimartingale market framework and derive the bsde representation of the wealth process associated with a self - financing trading strategy that replicates a default - free claim .",
    "as in @xcite they do not take counterparty credit risk into account .",
    "@xcite consider the viewpoint of the hedger , but do not derive arbitrage bounds for unilateral prices .",
    "these are instead analyzed in @xcite , who also examine the existence of fair bilateral prices . a good overview of the current literature is given in @xcite .",
    "in the present article we introduce a valuation framework which allows us to quantify the total valuation adjustment , abbreviated as xva , of a european type claim .",
    "we consider an underlying portfolio consisting of a default - free stock and two risky bonds underwritten by the trader s firm and his counterparty .",
    "stock purchases and sales are financed through the security lending market .",
    "we allow for asymmetry between treasury borrowing and lending rates , repo lending and borrowing rates , as well as between interest rates paid by the collateral taker and received by the collateral provider .",
    "we derive the nonlinear bsdes associated with the portfolios replicating long and short positions in the traded claim , taking into account counterparty credit risk and closeout payoffs exchanged at default .",
    "this extends , in our specific setting , the general semi - martingale framework introduced by @xcite by including counterparty default risk .",
    "due to rate asymmetries , the bsde which represents the valuation process of the portfolio replicating a long position in the claim can not be directly obtained ( via a sign change ) from the one replicating a short position .",
    "more specifically , there is a no - arbitrage interval which can be defined in terms of the buyer s and the seller s xva .    when borrowing and lending rates are the same , buyer s and seller s xva coincide , and we can develop a fully explicit expression which precisely identifies the contributions from funding costs , credit valuation adjustment ( cva ) , and debit valuation adjustment ( dva ) .",
    "moreover , we can express the total valuation adjustment as a percentage of the publicly available price of the claim .",
    "this gives an interpretation of the xva in terms of the cost of a trade , and has risk management implications because it pushes banks to attempt to reduce their borrowing costs in addition to choosing trades that minimize funding costs .",
    "we consider two different specializations of our framework .",
    "the first recovers the framework put forward by @xcite . here , we also give the exact expression for the number of shares associated with the replicating strategy of the investor .",
    "the latter is shown to consist of two components .",
    "the first is a funding adjusted delta hedging strategy , and the second is a correction based on the gap between funding and collateral rates .",
    "the second specialization is an extension of @xcite s model , which also incorporates the possibility of counterparty credit risk and hence includes trader and counterparty bonds into the portfolio of replicating securities . by means of cumbersome computations , we provide an explicit decomposition of xva into three main components : funding adjusted price of the transaction exclusive of collateral and default costs , funding adjusted closeout payments , and funding costs of the collateralization procedure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we develop the model in section [ sec : model ] and introduce replicated claim and collateral process in section [ sec : claim ] .",
    "we analyze arbitrage - free pricing of xva in section [ sec : bsdeform ] , and show that credit valuation adjustments can be recovered as special cases of our general formula . section [ sec : expexp ] develops an explicit expression for the xva under equal borrowing and lending rates .",

    "we consider two types of repo transactions : security driven and cash driven , see also @xcite .",
    "the security driven transaction is used to overcome the prohibition on `` naked '' short sales of stocks , that is the prohibition to the trader of selling a stock which he does not hold and hence can not deliver .",
    "the repo market helps to overcome this by allowing the trader to lend cash to the participants in the repo market who would post the stock as a collateral to the trader .",
