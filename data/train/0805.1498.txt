    "the evidence for a correlation between the arrival directions of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) with active galactic nuclei , as reported by the @xcite , supports many long standing expectations  @xcite .",
    "the active galactic nuclei with the most detailed available theory to actually accelerate protons to beyond @xmath1 ev are radio galaxies  @xcite . in all radio galaxies",
    "the feeding of outer radio emitting regions is done via a relativistic jet emanating from near a black hole .",
    "shock waves in such jets can accelerate particles just as shocks in the solar wind do .",
    "shocks in the jet emanating from near the black hole start around a few thousand gravitational radii , as it was shown with detailed spectral fits of the entire electromagnetic spectrum , including the spatial structure at the wavelengths where it is known .",
    "the shocks end as strong shocks at kpc or further out  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that when particles get accelerated at the first shock , proton - photon interactions limit their maximal energy @xcite .",
    "the correlation with the distribution of active galactic nuclei claimed by the auger collaboration has been disputed by the hires collaboration @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear at this point , whether both data sets use the same lower energy cutoff with the same sharpness .",
    "this is important , as the mhd simulations of cosmic magnetic fields @xcite show that scattering of ultra high energy particles rapidly increases with lower energy even near 60 eev .",
    "thus , with even a slight mismatch between the two data sets the statistics could be very skewed . using a complete sample of radio galaxy sources and their predicted properties as uhecr sources",
    ", these statistics will be explored elsewhere @xcite .",
    "radio galaxies with extended radio jets were classified into two categories by  @xcite : a population of high luminosity shows radio lobes at the outer edge of the jet , at kpc scales from the core , _ fanaroff riley ii objects , short fr - ii_. the lower luminosity population , on the other hand , has radio knots distributed along the jet , the first knot being as close as @xmath2  schwarzschild radii from the central core , _ fanaroff riley i objects , short fr - i_. both radio lobes and knots show non - thermal radio spectra , arising from electron acceleration at a shock front as first theoretically described by  @xcite . in analogy to processes in the creation of galactic cosmic rays , protons are believed to be accelerated at those shock fronts in the same way as electrons",
    ". in particular , oblique shocks can be very efficient in particle acceleration , and use electric fields in shock - drift acceleration due to the lorentz transformation of the magnetic fields in the proper frame , see  @xcite .      in this paper , we consider fr - i galaxies as the sources of the uhecrs potentially observed by auger .",
    "it is discussed by others  @xcite that the nearby fr - i galaxy ngc5128 , centaurus a ( cen  a in the following ) , is a good candidate to be responsible for a large fraction of the correlated events above @xmath3  eev .",
    "m  87 is another closeby candidate , see  @xcite , which can not contribute to a possible auger correlation , since it is barely in auger s field of view .",
    "the large number of more distant fr - i galaxies provide good candidates for the total cosmic ray flux above the ankle . here",
    ", we discuss the morphology of fr - i type galaxies and how these can accelerate particles to the highest energies .",
    "figure  [ agn_scheme_fri : fig ] presents a schematic view of the model of fr - i galaxies that we use in this paper . on the x - axis , the rotational - symmetric part of the agn is shown , while the y - axis represents the axis of rotational symmetry along the agn jet .",
    "both axes have logarithmic units .",
    "when the agn jet is pointed towards earth , the fr - i type galaxy is viewed as a bl lac type object @xcite , showing flat radio spectra , with an unresolved jet structure .",
    "when the agn jet is viewed at an angle , the jet structure with radio knots distributed along the jet can be observed .",
    "in contrast to the more radio - luminous fr - ii galaxies , fr - i type objects typically lack the observation of optical disks . while some of the fr - i type galaxies , such as m  87 , clearly lack luminous accretion disks and tori , many objects in this class may have accretion disks hidden behind the torus , provided that the torus is closed around the jet as indicated in fig .",
    "[ agn_scheme_fri : fig ] , see  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the jet - disk symbiosis model holds also for fr - i galaxies and the disk power scales with the radio luminosity .",
    "the dependence of the magnetic field in these jets along the jet axis @xmath4 is near @xmath5 at large distances .",
    "however , in the inner region , the radial dependence is not certain . here , we investigate the radial dependence of the magnetic field in order to determine the cosmic rays maximum energy along the jet and in particular , at the innermost part of the jet",
    ".    observations  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) suggest that the magnetic field runs as @xmath6 at first , since the radio polarization observation show that the magnetic field is parallel to the jet . by analogy to the solutions of @xmath7 in a magnetic wind  @xcite , the magnetic field locally shows a parallel component of @xmath8 .",
    "further out , the magnetic field observations suggest that , just as in a wind , the magnetic field becomes perpendicular to the flow direction , and so @xmath5 .",
    "it is obvious that in a smooth wind , any component decreasing with @xmath9 will ultimately win over a component running as @xmath6 . as the equation of state is almost certainly relativistic  (",
    "* e.g. ) , the total pressure @xmath10 depends on the density as @xmath11 , while in a conical simple jet the density @xmath12 , giving in near equipartition ( the magnetic field pressure running with the total pressure ) then @xmath13 .    however , repeated shock waves will reheat the material ( see e.g.  @xcite , as well as mach s original work in the 19th century , @xcite ) , and so we will assume that the mach - number of the flow repeatedly comes back to the same value , while the jet flow velocity will stay approximately constant . therefore going from crest to crest @xmath14 and",
    "so as a consequence @xmath15 this is consistent with the concept that the jet stays approximately conical .",
    "this argument is independent of the orientation of the magnetic field , and so the radio polarization observations are not in contradiction , but need then an interpretation as arising from highly oblique shocks , which emphasize magnetic field components parallel to the shock surface .",
    "highly oblique shocks are only possible for high mach - numbers , which again is consistent .",
    "as one check let us consider a system of repeated conical shocks , and ignore for simplicity the inner mach disks as shown schematically in fig .  [ agn_mach ]",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "then we can see , that given a specific mach - number at the initial flow formation there will be highly oblique shock waves , which will repeatedly reflect on the conical boundaries , and so produce a self - similar pattern as long as the mach - number keeps returning to near its initial value",
    ". a self - similar repeated structure with an ever increasing inner scale will result .",
    "this is precisely what is seen in jet structure at vastly discrepant spatial resolutions , like in the radio galaxy ngc6251 ( @xcite , and earlier papers ) .",
    "further examples for such a shock structure are recent observations of bl lacertae  @xcite and the bl lac type object s5  1803 + 784  @xcite .    for those oblique , stationary shocks ,",
    "it is likely that a mixture of sub- and superluminal shocks is present ) is possible ( subluminal ) or not ( superluminal ) . ] .",
    "the proton spectra look very different when comparing the two cases .",
    "while superluminal spectra have maximum energies of around @xmath16  gev , subluminal shocks can reach energies up to the highest energies , i.e.  @xmath17  ev , as shown by  @xcite .",
    "another consequence is that the magnetic field can be sufficiently high even far out to confine particles at the energies of uhecrs . as the magnetic field",
    "is anchored to the inner accretion rate , or its residual electric currents from an earlier accretion event , any magnetic field that decreases much faster than @xmath9 on the way out , will have difficulty to confine particles during their acceleration to the highest energies observed  @xcite . only a magnetic field which runs overall as @xmath5 allows the magnetic field to be relatively high far out along the jet structure .",
    "we conclude that the magnetic field then runs as @xmath18 approximately .",
    "normally when considering where uhecrs can be accelerated , the spatial limit , or hillas - limit , is invoked  @xcite .",
    "using radio observations this suggests that radio hot spots of powerful fanaroff - riley ii radio galaxies are very good bets : they are usually modelled as shocks  @xcite , which can be shown to accelerate particles to near @xmath19 ev  @xcite .    when using the information on the magnetic fields inferred from radio jets , their radio knots , and their hot spots , one typically finds @xmath20 gauss on kpc scales  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the maximum magnetic field close to the black hole , so on scales such as a few schwarzschild radii , is given by @xmath21  @xcite . therefore on radial scales over a factor of @xmath22 the magnetic field decreases by just this factor , quite indicative of a @xmath23 behavior .",
    "this was also used quite successfully by  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that such a radial dependence of the overall magnetic field is well justified .    when estimating what the magnetic field might be in a jet , we have used the current accretion rate to indicate an estimate , connecting it to the accretion disk  @xcite .",
    "this then gives usually a rather weak field in all cases when the overall activity is low , such as believed in bl lac objects .",
    "and a weak field fails the hillas test for uhecrs .    however , an alternative proposed by  @xcite is that the magnetic field is still quite high , from a prior accretion episode , and then the jet can be driven by a spin - down of the black hole . in this context",
    "the magnetic fields are higher , and even low power sources such as fr - i radio galaxies are possible sources of uhecrs  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lovelace limit  @xcite shows that the poynting flux , a lower limit to the energy flux in a jet , is connected to the maximal energy of a particle confined in the jet by @xmath24 .",
    "therefore a jet such as cen a , estimated to carry probably around @xmath25 @xcite can not possibly accelerate particles - especially protons - to @xmath19 ev , at most it would seem , that @xmath26 ev is possible .",
    "this limit can be exceeded by three arguments this limit can be exceeded through three arguments : ( a ) the particles might be heavier than hydrogen . in this case , however , photo - disintegration will reduce the neutrino flux , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "hence , we only consider protons in our calculations and this argument does not apply here .",
    "( b ) secondly and more importantly , @xcite show that the lorentz factor of the shock in the local upstream frame enters squared .",
    "( c ) further , the jets might be intermittent , as strongly demonstrated by the radio galaxy hercules a @xcite .",
    "therefore there is no a priori difficulty for fr - i radio galaxies to accelerate protons to near @xmath1 ev . with a magnetic field decreasing as @xmath9",
    ", the hillas spatial limit will give the same maximal proton energy at all radii .",
    "we discuss the interaction of ultra high energy cosmic rays with three different targets along the agn jet .",
    "we calculate the optical depth of interactions with the photon fields of the disk and the knots synchrotron field . as a third possible target",
    ", we consider the interaction of uhecrs where the jet meets the torus ( see fig .",

    "= 0.2 cm + to check on a realistic value for @xmath32 we estimate the interaction probability as follows : + in an active galactic nucleus the accretion disk will produce a radiation field near to the nucleus .",

    "these shockwaves accelerate particles , and these particles , say protons , interact with the radiation field .",
    "the photon density is then given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the typical photon energy , for which we adopt 20 ev , which is @xmath40 .",
    "using @xmath41 as a reference radius , this expression can be rewritten as @xmath42 the optical depth across the jet , with the length across the jet as @xmath43 , is the given by @xmath44 decreasing linearly outwards .",
    "since fr - i galaxies are not as efficient radiators as fr - ii galaxies ( see section  [ unified ] ) , the eddington rate in the best case is @xmath45 .",
    "those fr - i sources with the torus close around the jet , the optical depth is therefore @xmath46 . for other fr - i",
    "type objects , like m  87 , where the accretion rate has decreased , the disk can be come very faint .",
    "this means changing from a radiative disk , ( * ? ? ?",

    "* e.g. ) , and the optical depth will essentially be equal to zero .",
    "proton interactions with the synchrotron photon field in the jet _",
    "+ if protons interact with synchrotron photons in the same knot , the optical depth is given as @xmath47 .",
    "the particle density of synchrotron photons , @xmath48 , is given in the rest frame of the plasma and needs to be transformed into the observer s frame , @xmath49 .",
    "even if the shock is standing , the plasma is streaming with relativistic velocities along the jet , and so is the synchrotron photon field .",
    "the photon density observed at earth is thus modified from the field that the interacting protons see in the plasma s rest frame , see ( * ? ? ? * e.g. ) : @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the boost factor of the streaming plasma relative to earth .",
    "the photon density in the plasma s frame can be determined by assuming that the luminosity of a knot along the jet is a fraction @xmath52 of the total synchrotron luminosity , @xmath53  erg / s : @xmath54 the frequency of synchrotron photons is @xmath55  ghz .",
    "hence , the optical depth is @xmath56 thus , for a relativistically streaming plasma of @xmath57 , optical depths around unity are expected . at the foot of the jet , where it is still very collimated , it can therefore be expected that a large fraction of the protons interacts before escaping , producing neutrinos . farther outside in the jet ,",
    "the size of the knots increases with the distance along the jet and the optical depth will decrease .",
    "so , even in the case of synchrotron radiation , the main location of neutrino production is expected at the foot of the jet , while protons will be able to escape the source at larger distances from the core .",
    "3 .   _ proton interactions with the proton field _ + for fr - i galaxies with closed tori , the outer edges of the jet will pass through the torus , at a distance of @xmath58  pc from the central black hole .",
    "the column depth of the torus is @xmath59 .",
    "the proton - proton optical depth is therefore @xmath60 with @xmath61  mb .",
    "this interaction efficiency of 0.2% is small compared to the proton - photon optical depths discussed above .",
    "in addition , only the small fraction of all protons in the outer parts of the jet will interact ( see fig .",
    "[ agn_scheme_fri : fig ] ) .",
    "we conclude that proton - proton interactions can be neglected here .",
    "to sum up , proton - photon interactions are the dominant source of high - energy neutrino production .",
    "optical depths are around unity at the foot of the jet and decrease with the distance from the core .",
    "therefore , we expect neutrino production in the first large shock at around @xmath62 .      as a consequence of the high optical photon - proton optical depth close to the foot of fr - i jets , there has to be abundant neutrino production near that first shock , and that shock is in the already high speed relativistic flow . on the other hand , as we now suspect that there is lateral substructure in these relativistic flows  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , things could be subtle as regards the specific beaming  ( * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the spatial conditions suffice for the production of @xmath63  gev protons at the base of the jet , but losses due to proton interactions with the disk s photon field will take several powers of ten from that as we discuss in the following subsection .",
    "the ultra high energy particles we do observe probably receive their last energy increase at the last strong shock ( see @xcite ) , since the optical depth decreases with the distance from the agn core .",
    "neutrino observations may have the spatial resolution to check on this .",
    "the schematic view of this agn model , showing the agn jet with its shocks , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ agn_jet ] .",
    "since neutrino production happens close to the foot of the agn jet in a strongly accelerated reference system , the emission of neutrinos is beamed .",
    "the neutrino background due to active galactic nuclei has been estimated many times , usually in conjunction to the process of accelerating ultra high energy particles , see e.g.  reviews by  @xcite .",
    "in particular , flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , interpreted as fr - ii sources with their jet pointing towards earth , have been predicted to emit neutrinos by  @xcite .",
    "further , one extensive work is by  @xcite , who consider the acceleration of protons very close to the disk , up to distances of @xmath64 cm , and using a reconnection model for the acceleration , a process well studied in activity regions on the sun . in our model , on the other hand , we discuss distances of about @xmath65 gravitational radii , so for typical black hole masses of @xmath66 , so distances somewhat larger , about @xmath67 cm , and adopt the point of view that shock wave acceleration is the dominant process .",
    "on the other hand , just as  @xcite , we use the disk radiation as the photon field for interaction .",
    "their figure 3a demonstrates the limit of such an approach : a typical disk temperature is of order @xmath68 k  @xcite , or sometimes even higher , as also used in  @xcite .",
    "they confirm that the optical depth is of order unity .",
    "however , there is one critical difference : in shock acceleration the energetic protons are isotropic in the comoving frame , here moving with a lorentz factor of order @xmath69 , or perhaps even higher  @xcite .",
    "so we do not have in our concept a proton moving rectilinearly straight out , but protons in a phase space distribution moving along with the relativistic jet flow @xcite .",
    "hence , particle emission is beamed along the jet axis .",
    "neutrinos are therefore only observable from earth if the jet points ( almost ) directly towards the observer",
    ". since protons are likely to be produced in the last strong shock , agn seen from the side also contribute to the flux of cosmic rays .      as a consequence of the beamed neutrino emission , neutrinos correlated to the proton emission of radio galaxies",
    "can only be observed from flat spectrum radio sources ( frs ) , i.e.  fr - i galaxies with their jet pointing towards earth .",
    "most recently , the detection of a double - structure flare in optical and x - ray wavelengths from the flat spectrum radio source bl lacertae was interpreted as the emission from particle acceleration in moving shock fronts very close to the central black hole .",
    "then , when the plasma reaches the turbulent zone which marks the transition from moving to stationary shocks , a second synchrotron flare is seen from particle acceleration in the stationary shock , see  @xcite for details . during the first x - ray flare , @xmath70  gev emission from bl lacertae",
    "was detected by the magic telescope  @xcite .",
    "@xcite explain this high - energy component by inverse compton scattering of the accelerated electrons with the synchrotron photons",
    ". an alternative explanation would be the production of very high - energy photons via photohadronic interactions . here , charged and neutral pions are produced , the charged pions decaying to produce neutrinos and the neutral pions resulting in tev photons .",
    "thus , if the tev signal is of hadronic nature , i.e.  if it arises from @xmath71decays , neutrinos are produced simultaneously , as also discussed by @xcite .",
    "steep spectrum radio sources are agn seen from the side , often showing a detailed jet structure , with radio knots along the jets ( fr - i galaxies ) or radio lobes at the outer end of the jet .",
    "we predict that those sources are weak neutrino sources , considering the model presented above : the beamed emission from the jet is not directed towards earth and very strongly focused neutrino emission can not be observed from earth .    as for one of the brightest radio galaxies in the sky ,",
    "cen a , it will be possible to localize the origin of neutrinos within the source : the extension of cen a is ten degrees on the sky , while the resolution of neutrino detection with icecube will be around @xmath72 .",
    "so , the flux of high energy neutrinos produced in each subsequent shock region will diminish with the distance from the black hole and the maximal energy will go up .",
    "however , as the jet of cen a is not pointing near to the line of sight , we will see neutrinos only from secondary particles decay , after a primary charged particle has scattered in magnetic fields , near the boundary or outside the relativistic jet . in this paper",
    ", we will calculate the intensity of the neutrino signal connected to the possible correlation of uhecrs and the distribution of agn as observed by auger  @xcite .",
    "recent auger results  @xcite indicate that at least @xmath73 events above @xmath74  eev are correlated with the distribution of nearby agn in the vron - cetty & vron catalog , @xcite , abbreviated vcv catalog in the following .",
    "the integrated exposure above @xmath75  eev is given as exposure  @xmath76  km@xmath77  yr  sr and can be assumed to be the same above @xmath74  eev .",
    "thus , the integral flux of uhecrs is @xmath78 and in this case @xmath79 if the flux is correlated to a single or few point source(s ) rather than to many sources , the field of view ( fov ) of auger @xmath80 has to be taken into account in combination with the declination of the sources @xmath81 , as discussed in the approaches of  @xcite .",
    "as opposed to those models , we calculate the diffuse contribution as a conservative estimate , based on a detailed model concerning the physics of the agn jet .",
    "based on the correlation claimed by auger , we assume in the following calculation that these @xmath73 events come from agn in the supergalactic plane ( sgp ) .",
    "if the source population for the origin of the calculation is verified to be radio galaxies , it is likely that even more than @xmath73 events come from agn , since the vcv catalog is not complete .",
    "the differential flux from the sgp can be assumed to follow a power - law , @xmath82 here , the cosmic ray energy @xmath83 is given in the laboratory frame at earth . in all following calculations , energies @xmath84 are in the laboratory frame at earth , energies @xmath85 are given in the laboratory frame at the source and @xmath86 represent the energy in the shock rest frame , with @xmath51 as the bulk lorenz factor of the shock and @xmath87 as the cosmological redshift of the source .",

    "however , stochastic shock acceleration itself results in a spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath96 or even flatter , see e.g.  papers by  @xcite or @xcite .",

    "x - ray photons are assumed to interact with the protons in the sources , which results in a broken power - law behavior when calculating the neutrino flux .",
    "the reason is that the optical depth for proton - photon interaction changes with energy , and this change happens at a neutrino energy of around @xmath154  gev for x - ray photons . in the case of optical or radio photons ,",
    "the break is at very low energies , so that it is not relevant for our calculations .",

    "the authors do not distinguish between the high- and low - luminosity sources , so both fr - ii type objects ( `` fsrqs '' ) and fr - i ( `` bl lacs '' ) are included .",
    "since the low - luminosity part of the sources makes up most of the population , we neglect the contribution of fsrqs here and interpret this function of flat spectrum radio sources ( frs ) as an approximation of the fr - i component of blazars . + as discussed before , neutrino emission is beamed and originates from frs only . for protons ,",
    "all fr - i galaxies contribute : @xmath163 the radio luminosity function of fr - i galaxies is given in  @xcite . as the auger correlation at most reveals a general correlation between the distribution of agn and cosmic rays ,",
    "the exact number of sources is not known .",
    "note that the extension of sources goes with the distance squared rather than with the total volume due to the disk - like structure of the sgp , see  @xcite .",
    "this is compensated by using the volume integration for both the neutrino and the cosmic ray sources : the relevant ratio @xmath164 gives the correct result .",
    "+ figure  [ nzmax ] shows how the ratio @xmath164 depends on the maximum redshift of contributing sources to the observed correlation .",
    "the more sources contribute , the larger @xmath165 and the smaller the ratio . the most conservative assumption is to assume that all sources in the supergalactic plane contribute to the correlation , @xmath166 , see also @xcite .",

    "[ sgp_neutrinos : fig ] , assuming that the auger correlation is caused by all sources up to @xmath166 .",
    "the neutrino flux is higher at lower energies for the steeper spectrum @xmath172 .",
    "the reason is that the normalization is done at auger s threshold energy .",
    "if the spectrum is steep @xmath173 , the energy content at lower energies is higher .",
    "if the spectrum is very flat ( e.g.  @xmath174 ) , the contribution at energies lower than @xmath175 is also lower ( see fig .  [",
    "energy_density : fig ] ) .",
    "if the spectrum flattens towards smaller energies , this reduces the normalization as well .",
    "the numerical value of the neutrino normalization constant for an @xmath176spectrum is @xmath177 the expected neutrino flux is about a factor of @xmath178 higher if the closest agn produce the correlation of cosmic rays and agn .",
    "the total , extragalactic neutrino flux can be calculated by integrating up the neutrino flux redshift dependence up to @xmath179 , where the first active galaxies are believed to contribute , see  @xcite . the result is shown in fig .  [",

    ", we use the conservative assumption that sources up to @xmath166 contribute to the correlation between cosmic rays and the distribution of agn . for an @xmath170shaped spectrum ( black , horizontal , solid line ) ,",
    "the flux is about a factor of @xmath180 higher than the prediction made in  @xcite , where the jet - disk symbiosis model was used to estimate the neutrino flux from fsrqs . since we normalize the agn spectrum at the highest energies , a steeper neutrino spectrum ( e.g.  @xmath181 , red , solid line ) leads to a higher flux at low energies .",
    "although the figure seems to indicate that an @xmath171 flux is already excluded by amanda data , it should be noted that the limit is derived for an @xmath170 shaped spectrum . to be able to exclude the @xmath171 spectrum",
    ", the limit needs to be calculated for the same spectral behavior , see  @xcite .",
    "neutrino flux calculations typically bear three significant sources of uncertainties , the first one being in the total normalization of the spectrum , the second one lying in the uncertainty of the spectral behavior .",
    "the third one is the maximum neutrino energy of the source class .",
    "both quantities always rely on the internal properties of the source class , which are typically poorly determined .",
    "this is true in general and does not only apply to these calculations . here , we explain how these calculations are effected by the uncertainties .    1 .   _ the normalization _ + the uncertainty in the normalization of neutrino spectra has three main components : the _ measured spectrum _ used to normalize the neutrino flux , the _ optical depth _ in the sources and the _ opening angle _ of neutrino and proton emission .",
    "+ the correlation of the highest energy cosmic rays with the vcv catalog is based on @xmath73 events .",
    "these statistics need to be enhanced in order to achieve a more precise prediction of the actual cosmic ray flux from the source class .",
    "in addition , the composition of the spectrum is important for the neutrino flux , since protons produce more neutrinos than heavy nuclei do .",
    "+ secondly , the optical depth of the sources depends on the size of the acceleration region , on the luminosity , on the boost factor and on the photon density in the acceleration region .",
    "those properties are known for a few single objects , but they can vary with the source and also with time in a given source . +",
    "the ratio of opening angles of proton and neutrino emission is conservatively taken to be @xmath155 . however , the real ratio clearly depends on the properties of the single agn , on the location of the first and last shocks .",
    "2 .   _ the spectral index _",
    "+ depending on the orientation of the shock towards the magnetic field and the boost factor , the spectral behavior can vary . for parallel shocks , a spectral behavior of @xmath181 is expected as discussed by  @xcite . if using large angle scattering instead of pitch angle scattering for parallel shocks , particle spectra of up to @xmath182 can be obtained @xcite . for oblique , subluminal shocks , the spectra behave as @xmath183 , depending on the boost factor , as discussed by  @xcite .",
    "3 .   _ maximum energy _ + as discussed before , the maximum energy of the protons , and hence of the neutrinos , depends on intrinsic quantities like the magnetic field , boost factor and the disk luminosity .",
    "so , to conclude , the importance of large volume neutrino detectors is enhanced by the fact that protons or high - energy photons can not give unambiguous evidence for the spectral index , nor for the strength of the neutrino flux . in order to identify the nature of the shocks in not only agn , but any galactic or extragalactic accelerator , neutrinos are essential . in this paper , we predict the _ _",
    "r__egion of neutrino production in agn jets .",
    "we predict that flat spectrum radio sources should be dominant .",
    "this can easily be tested by future experiments like icecube and km3net .",
    "in this paper , we present a model for cosmic ray and neutrino emission from active galactic nuclei . a first evidence for the correlation of the observed uhecrs above @xmath3  eev and the distribution of nearby agn gives rise to the prediction that uhecrs may come from fr - i galaxies .",
    "although fr - ii galaxies would be a good candidate due to their high intrinsic luminosity , they are not abundant enough and too far away to lead to such a correlation .",
    "fr - i galaxies , on the other hand , have a much higher source density and there exist several nearby sources which could be responsible for a directional correlation .",
    "the most prominent fr - i galaxies are cen  a and m  87 , as well as the flat spectrum radio sources bl lac and perseus  a. flat spectrum radio sources with low luminosities , called bl lac objects , are typically interpreted as fr - i galaxies with their jet pointing directly towards earth .    observations of the jet structure of m  87  @xcite and bl lac @xcite near the central black hole indicate that , while there can be moving shocks between @xmath180  and  @xmath184 schwarzschild - radii , the first strong , stationary shock occurs at @xmath2 schwarzschild - radii ( @xmath185 ) , as already discussed by  @xcite .",
    "this is further confirmed by @xcite in the case of the bl lac type object s5  1803 + 784 . at @xmath186 , the optical depth for proton interactions with photons from the disk",
    "is around 2% .",
    "with synchrotron photons from the jet as a target , the optical depth is @xmath187 at the same distance from the central black hole . in both cases ,",
    "the optical depth decreases with the distance from the black hole , @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , we predict that neutrinos are produced in the narrow jet , close to the central black hole . their emission is beamed due to the proton s highly relativistic motion along the jet .",
    "therefore , neutrinos can only be observed for sources pointing directly towards earth .",
    "protons , on the other hand , dominantly arise in the last strong shock of the jet , at several kpc distance from the central black hole , where the optical depth is close to zero .    using the correlation between uhecrs and the distribution of agn as a measure for the cosmic ray flux from the supergalactic plane and connecting this to the neutrino emission produced near the foot the agn jet results in a predicted neutrino signal about an order of magnitude below the current amanda limit  @xcite .",
    "icecube will be able to test this model within the first years of operation .",
    "the general terms of this model are independent of auger data , and could have been normalized to the established uhecr flux  @xcite , assuming that radio galaxies are the sources  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "auger does confirm a correlation with the distribution of active galactic nuclei  @xcite , while hires  @xcite does not , using the same energy threshold , and the same procedure .",
    "it is clear that more data are required , and the energy threshold might ultimately be seriously different ; the results show that a confirmation from a larger data set will be necessary .",
