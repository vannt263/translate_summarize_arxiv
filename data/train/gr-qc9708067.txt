    "a key goal of numerical relativity is to determine the gravitational radiation produced by the inspiral and coalescence of two black holes in a decaying binary orbit .",
    "the importance of solving this problem is heightened by the possibility that gravitational wave detectors such as ligo , virgo , and geo may observe gravitational waveforms from binary black hole coalescence within the next decade .",
    "not only could a comparison of measured waveforms with numerical simulations provide a crucial strong - field test of general relativity , but in addition , accurate templates produced by these simulations could significantly increase the sensitivity of waveform measurements @xcite and reduce the uncertainties in astrophysical parameters derived from gravitational wave data .",
    "although constructing a numerical simulation of binary black hole coalescence is a difficult and unsolved problem , several recent advances have brought us closer to a solution .",
    "one key advance is the development of so - called apparent horizon boundary condition ( ahbc ) methods , which treat black holes by evolving only the regions of spacetime that lie outside apparent horizons .",
    "these methods take advantage of the fact that information can not emerge from within the apparent horizon of a black hole ( which , assuming cosmic censorship , is contained within the event horizon ) . without ahbc schemes , the spacetime singularity that inevitably forms inside a black hole eventually causes numerical simulations to terminate , typically on a time scale of order @xmath0 to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the system . for this reason",
    ", ahbc methods may be crucial for solving the binary black hole problem , where one hopes to evolve two holes long enough to see them orbit , coalesce , and eventually settle into a final state containing a single ( kerr ) black hole .",
    "another promising development is the construction of manifestly hyperbolic formulations of einstein s equations . not only do these formulations offer insights into the mathematical structure of general relativity , but they may also be better - suited for numerical solution than the usual adm@xcite equations , which are not manifestly hyperbolic .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : first , there exists an extensive literature concerning stable and efficient numerical methods for solving hyperbolic systems of equations@xcite . some of these methods have been successfully applied to hyperbolic formulations of general relativity by bona and masso@xcite .",
    "the second reason is that a non - hyperbolic set of equations can present a fundamental difficulty for black hole simulations that employ an ahbc approach .    to understand this difficulty ,",
    "consider a non - hyperbolic set of equations , or even a hyperbolic set that has characteristics lying outside the local light cone .",
    "suppose such a system is to be solved on a domain that includes a black hole .",
    "although the physics guarantees that nothing can emerge from the hole , the equations do not know this , and nonphysical ( gauge ) modes can propagate outward through the apparent horizon . solving such a system of equations on a restricted domain that excludes",
    "the interior of the hole is mathematically well - posed only if appropriate boundary conditions are imposed on the horizon .",
    "while it should be possible to impose explicit horizon boundary conditions to fix the coordinate system@xcite , it is unclear which boundary conditions are appropriate for dynamical variables , particularly in the general three - dimensional case in which one may have a nonspherical horizon and a significant amount of gravitational radiation .",
    "now consider a hyperbolic set of equations with characteristics that never lie outside the local light cone . in this case , future - pointing characteristics inside the apparent horizon ( which must be an outgoing non - timelike surface ) can never intersect the horizon itself , so that quantities at or outside the horizon can not depend on the interior region .",
    "consequently , one can solve this set of equations on a restricted domain that excludes the interior of the hole , and one can do so without imposing boundary conditions on the horizon .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the hyperbolic formulation of einstein s equations originally proposed by choquet - bruhat and york @xcite , hereafter referred to as the cby system .",
    "this formulation has several advantageous features .",
    "first , the characteristics of this set of equations are extremely simple : they lie either along the light cone or along the normal to the current time slice .",
    "this guarantees that no information , not even gauge information , can propagate acausally .",
    "second , the equations admit an arbitrary shift vector , and the characteristics are independent of the choice of shift . finally , the fundamental variables in this formulation are spatially covariant three - dimensional tensors .",
    "these tensors directly measure spacetime curvature , and from them one can form all components of the spacetime weyl tensor .    while we believe that the cby formalism holds considerable promise for numerical simulations , particularly when combined with ahbc methods , there is no experience with solving this particular set of equations on a computer . therefore , before expending the significant effort required to implement the cby equations in a full three - dimensional code , it is important to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible .",
    "accordingly , we have developed a numerical code that solves the spherically symmetric einstein equations using the cby formalism .",
    "we evolve a schwarzschild spacetime using a causal differencing scheme , and we use an ahbc method to avoid the central singularity .",
    "this is the first time the cby equations have been used to evolve a numerical spacetime containing a black hole .",
    "our code runs in parallel , and is rigorously second order convergent . as described in detail elsewhere@xcite",
    ", it can run for times in excess of @xmath3 provided certain constraints are regularly enforced .",
    "our code is based on the dagh@xcite software package originally developed for the binary black hole grand challenge alliance .",
    "it is written in c++ , and uses fortran-90 numerical kernels .",
    "the dagh system contains support for adaptive mesh refinement , but we have not yet taken advantage of this feature .",
    "our code provides an important demonstration that the cby formulation works well in numerical simulations .",
    "it allows us to study the details of implementing the cby equations in a simple setting , and it provides a testing ground for apparent horizon excising schemes and causal differencing algorithms .",
    "it also serves as an important check on a code that solves the cby equations in three spatial dimensions , a code that is currently under development and will be described elsewhere .",
    "we employ results and methods specific to spherical symmetry as little as possible , so that our techniques are readily generalizable to the three - dimensional case with cartesian coordinates .",
    "for example , we do not use logarithmic radial coordinates@xcite despite the great advantages they provide for spherically symmetric codes .",
    "likewise , although there are many shift conditions that work well with ahbc methods in spherical symmetry@xcite , we consider only those that can be applied in the general three - dimensional case .",
    "recent progress has also been made in spherical symmetry by choosing a global coordinate system that has desirable properties near the horizon@xcite .",
    "the spatial gauge used by @xcite depends on the concept of an areal radius , and is thus applicable only in spherical symmetry .",
    "we forego such a coordinate choice in favor of a more general approach .    in section  [ sec : eqns ]",
    ", we summarize the cby formulation of einstein s equations , and we specialize this formulation to the case of spherical symmetry . in section  [ sec : evolution ] , we present a key ingredient of our code : a causal differencing scheme that is second - order convergent and has a stability criterion that is independent of the shift vector .",
    "we describe this scheme in detail for the general case of three spatial dimensions , and then apply it to the spherically symmetric case . in section  [ sec : shift ]",
    "we describe the ahbc method employed at the inner boundary of our grid , and the shift conditions that we use in order to implement this method .",
    "these shift conditions not only allow us to control the motion of the apparent horizon through the grid , but they also prevent coordinate singularities that may result from differential stretching or compression of the grid in the remainder of the spacetime . in section  [ sec : outerbdry ] we discuss the boundary condition that we impose at the outer boundary of our grid .",
    "this boundary is ideally at spatial infinity , but in practice it is placed at a large but finite radius . in section  [ sec : tests ] we present the results of rigorous convergence tests using our code . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we close with a short discussion of our results .",

    "we instead use the shift for a different purpose : to allow us to truncate our computational domain just inside the apparent horizon , so that we evolve only the exterior region .",
    "we thus avoid the spacetime singularity inside the black hole .",
    "if we were to attempt such a truncation with @xmath128 , numerical grid points originally located just outside the apparent horizon would soon fall in , and any grid points located inside the apparent horizon would eventually encounter the singularity .",
    "this is because for zero shift , numerical grid points follow the world lines of normal observers , and these world lines are necessarily timelike .",
    "we force the inner boundary of our grid , @xmath108 , to hover within a grid spacing of the apparent horizon . to accomplish this for a static black hole , we choose @xmath38 near the horizon to point along the outward normal to the horizon , and we choose its magnitude so that the local coordinate speed of light in that direction is zero .",

    "because we use a cell - centered grid , the inner boundary @xmath108 is located half a grid spacing inside the innermost valid grid point .    numerical errors typically cause the horizon to drift through the grid , even if one tries to lock it in place by forcing @xmath131 .",
    "while this drift seems to cause minimal difficulty with either the stability or accuracy of the code , for coarse - resolution runs it produces a small but distracting gauge pulse each time the horizon crosses a grid zone .",
    "horizon drift can be eliminated by introducing a feedback mechanism@xcite that adjusts the magnitude of the shift to compensate .",

    "when locating the apparent horizon after the macormack predictor step , we must be sure to use the value of @xmath141 and not @xmath78 in evaluating the function @xmath139 at each grid point .    in principle , one can also use a shift condition at the apparent horizon to move a black hole through the numerical grid .",
    "this could be accomplished by adjusting the shift so that grid points on one side of the hole fall into the horizon , and grid points on the other side emerge from it .",
    "a similar idea could in principle be applied to rotating black holes or systems with more than one black hole .      treating",
    "the inner boundary correctly is a primary motivation for using a hyperbolic formulation of the einstein equations .",
    "the spherically symmetric cby equations have only three characteristics at each spacetime point .",
    "these lie along the ingoing and outgoing null rays , and along the normal vector @xmath39 .",
    "a boundary condition is required only at a point that can not obtain information from one or more of the characteristics passing through it .",
    "for example , the outer boundary can not obtain information from the ingoing null characteristics that it intersects , because these characteristics originate from outside the computational domain , where we have no data . to update quantities at the outer boundary",
    ", this information must be provided by a boundary condition .",
    "similarly , the inner boundary ordinarily requires a boundary condition because it can not obtain information from the outgoing null characteristics that it intersects .",
    "however , if the inner boundary follows an outgoing spacelike or null trajectory , then each point on the inner boundary can obtain information from all three characteristics passing through it , so a boundary condition is not required .",
    "this is the essence of an ahbc scheme for treating the inner boundary : by forcing the inner boundary to move along with the apparent horizon , we force it along an outgoing non - timelike path .",
    "therefore , there is no need to impose an explicit inner boundary condition .",
    "regardless of the mathematical formulation of einstein s equations being used , general relativity tells us that when the inner boundary follows an outgoing spacelike or null path , information with physical content can not penetrate this boundary from the inside , since this information can not propagate outside the light cone .",
    "a key advantage of a hyperbolic formulation with only simple ( non - spacelike ) characteristics is that in such a formulation , this statement applies to gauge information as well .    the way we solve eqs .",
    "( [ cbyespher ] ) without imposing an explicit condition at the inner boundary is by simply ignoring the innermost grid point during the interpolation step of our causal differencing scheme . in the case",
    "where the inner boundary @xmath108 moves with respect to the @xmath72 coordinate a distance less than @xmath123 during each time step , the interpolation becomes an extrapolation at the innermost point .",
    "this is always the case in our simulation because of the courant limit : because the inner boundary , which moves along with the apparent horizon , has a velocity with respect to the @xmath72 coordinate system of approximately @xmath130 , the inner boundary can never move farther than @xmath123 during a time step without violating the courant condition @xmath142 .",
    "one could avoid this extrapolation by using an implicit differencing scheme@xcite to get around the courant condition , but such a scheme requires much more computer time than explicit schemes , especially in the multidimensional case .",
    "once a shift criterion at the apparent horizon has been chosen , one must then determine the shift in the remainder of the spacetime . at spatial infinity ,",
    "one presumably would like the shift to approach zero , so that the spacetime metric components approach minkowski values . or perhaps , in the case of spacetimes with nonzero angular momentum , one would like the asymptotic shift to describe a co - rotating frame . however , given the shift at infinity and at the apparent horizon , it is not clear how to choose the shift elsewhere .",
    "one possibility is to use a parameterized analytic function whose parameters are set so that the shift behaves appropriately near the apparent horizon and far from the black hole .",
    "for example , when evolving a single black hole in spherical symmetry we have tried the gaussian form @xmath143 where @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 are chosen so that @xmath118 is equal to @xmath130 at the apparent horizon , @xmath147 is equal to @xmath148 at the apparent horizon , and @xmath118 is smaller than some threshold at the outer boundary of the grid .",
    "although this choice results in a second order convergent evolution , we find that the grid points tend to compress or stretch where the shift gradients are large , and eventually coordinate singularities develop that cause the simulation to terminate . similarly , one can choose @xmath149 so that the shift is equal to @xmath130 far inside some arbitrary radius @xmath150 , and zero far outside @xmath150 .",
    "in this case , the grid points become compressed near @xmath150 as one evolves in time , and again the simulation terminates .",
    "it therefore appears that in addition to a prescription for specifying the shift at the apparent horizon and at infinity , one must impose some additional restriction on the shift that ensures that it will not induce any coordinate pathologies elsewhere .",
    "such a restriction can be provided by two different elliptic shift conditions that were introduced for the very purpose of minimizing coordinate strain caused by a shift vector .",
    "the first is the minimal distortion condition @xcite , which can be written in the form @xmath151.\\ ] ] the minimal distortion shift minimizes the average change of shape of a spatial volume element as it is dragged from one time slice to the next .",
    "a related choice is the minimal strain condition @xcite , which can be written in the form @xmath152 the minimal strain shift minimizes the average change in the three metric @xmath7 as one evolves from one time slice to the next .",
    "it differs from the minimal distortion shift in that it takes into account the change in size of spatial volume elements as well as their change in shape .",
    "the downside of these shift conditions is that they require one to solve elliptic equations .",
    "this can be costly in terms of computer time , especially in three dimensions",
    ". it may be possible to use a parameterized analytic function to mimic one of these conditions , or it may suffice to use an approximate solution .",

    "while the cby formulation of einstein s equations at first glance looks more complicated than the usual adm formulation , in most respects it is actually much simpler , particularly from a numerical point of view .",
    "each equation in the cby system is either a wave equation with an advective term , or a simple advective equation . in the @xmath64 coordinate system that is used for causal differencing ,",
    "the equations are even simpler : they are either wave equations or first - order ordinary differential equations in time . admittedly , the right - hand sides of these equations are complicated and nonlinear , but because these right - hand sides contain no derivatives , they do not make numerical solution of the equations any more difficult .",
    "the large number of evolution equations in the cby formalism is also not a serious drawback because the equations are all of the same form , so they can all be solved by the same method .    unlike a previous work@xcite in which we forced the horizon to sit at a particular grid point , here we allow the horizon to lie at some arbitrary location on the grid",
    "this is a closer approximation to what we expect in the three - dimensional case , where one would most likely use cartesian coordinates to describe a spherical hole .",
    "likewise , in the same work we imposed explicit boundary conditions on the apparent horizon in order to solve elliptic constraint equations outside the hole .",
    "here we do not impose explicit boundary conditions ( except for the shift via eq .",
    "( [ shiftbcinner ] ) ) because in the three - dimensional case it is not only difficult to impose such conditions on a nonspherical boundary , but also the number of boundary conditions needed for solving all of the constraints in three dimensions exceeds the number of boundary conditions available at the horizon .",
    "a key milestone in three - dimensional black hole simulations is the ability to stably move a hole through the numerical grid .",
    "this is arguably a necessary precursor to simulating binary orbits .",
    "techniques for moving holes through the grid could be tested in spherical symmetry using our code , and we plan such tests in the future . to preserve spherical symmetry , the motion in this case would be the expansion or contraction ( in coordinate space ) of the hole rather than the translation of the hole s center , but since the location of the center is irrelevant for ahbc methods , many of the same methods should apply to both cases .",
    "the code as described here tends to lose accuracy at times greater than 10 or 20 @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "because this behavior is relatively independent of numerical details such as grid resolution , we believe that it may be due to either gauge modes or unphysical rapidly - growing solutions of the evolution equations that do not satisfy the constraints .",
    "one way of solving this problem is to enforce several of the constraint equations after each time step . with this modification",
    ", we can integrate past @xmath231 .",
