    "<S> the carrier frequency of the radiation frequency of the source @xmath11 is changed by a constant velocity doppler shift . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the transmitted radiation , showing a frequency - comb mssbauer spectrum , is described by equation@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the frequency dependent absorption coefficient of the single line absorber , @xmath26 is the absorber thickness , and @xmath27 is the power spectrum of the radiation field seen by the vibrated nuclei . here </S>",
    "<S> , the power spectrum is averaged over the random time of photon emission @xmath28 ( see supplementary information for details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> frequency - domain mssbauer spectrum is measured by counting the number of photons , detected within long time windows of the same duration for all resonant detunings , which are varied by changing the value of a constant velocity of the mssbauer drive moving the source . </S>",
    "<S> time windows are not synchronized with the mechanical vibration and their duration @xmath29 is much longer than the oscillation period @xmath30 .    if @xmath8 , the spectral components of the frequency comb , seen by the absorber nuclei , overlap resulting in the spectrum broadening of the radiation field ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> since the radiation intensity is @xmath51 , which is the product of the complex conjugated amplitudes @xmath52 containing the exponential phase factor @xmath53 $ ] , the time dependent phase @xmath54 of the field amplitude does not lead to the additional time dependence of the intensity . </S>",
    "<S> this fact , resulting from the simple relation @xmath55 , can be explained by a particular interference of the spectral components of this specific frequency comb . </S>",
    "<S> for example , only zero frequency spectral component is present in the intensity , @xmath56 , since all zero spectral components , resulting from the products @xmath57 with @xmath58 , are summed up with the equal weights as@xmath59 while the first harmonic @xmath60 is zero because this sum gives@xmath61 the same is true for all higher frequency components . </S>",
    "<S> this fragile balance between spectral components is easily broken after passing through the single line absorber . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for lfc the absorber of thickness @xmath26 satisfying the relation @xmath62 is already capable to produce noticeable time oscillations of the intensity . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast to hfc ( @xmath63 ) , lfc ( @xmath64 ) becomes sensitive to exact resonance if effective halfwidth of the comb @xmath65 is nearly equal to the width of the absorption line @xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> this dependence is compared with that for hfc , generated by the vibration with high frequency @xmath80 mhz and optimal value of the modulation index @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that lfc is at least two times more sensitive to resonance than hfc since the slope of the dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath76 is two times steeper .    </S>",

    "<S> the spectral width of each fourier component is close to 10 khz . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we may conclude that within a moderate time of experiment the proposed method is able to measure the resonant detuning for @xmath2fe with the accuracy of 10 kilohertz , which is 100 times smaller than the absorption linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> this is essentially better accuracy than in the method of the resonant detuning measurements , used in the gravitational red - shift measurements @xcite , which employs four known values of the calibrated , controllable resonant detunings : two very large , comparable with the absorption halfwidth , and two very small , comparable but appreciably exceeding the measured detuning . in time </S>",
    "<S> domain measurements , by extending considerably the length of the time window where the oscillations are collected , one can reach even higher accuracy of several hz .    concluding , we demonstrate a method how with lfc one can measure precisely the resonant frequency of the absorber with the accuracy equal to a tiny fraction of the homogeneous absorption width . </S>",
    "<S> this method is also applicable in optical domain . </S>",
    "<S> modulation of the resonant frequency of atoms or impurity ions by stark / zeeman effects or modulation of the frequency of the laser beam by acousto - optical modulator are equivalent to creation of a frequency comb in a particular reference frame . </S>",
    "<S> the interference of the scattered radiation field with the incident field is capable to produce the output intensity oscillations . by a proper choice of the modulation frequency and </S>",
    "<S> modulation index one can make this oscillations to be very sensitive to exact resonance or to measure the frequency difference between the incident radiation and resonance frequency of atoms with the accuracy not limited by the value of the homogeneous linewidth . </S>"
