    "with the advent of new precision data @xcite , which extend previous lattice qcd gauge theory evaluations @xcite for the pure gluon plasma to a larger temperature range , a tempting task is to seek for an appropriate gravity dual model .",
    "while such an approach does not neccessarily provide new insights in the pure su(3 ) yang - mills equation of state above the deconfinement temperature @xmath7 , it however allows to calculate , without additional ingredients , further observables , e.g.  transport coefficients .",
    "( this is in contrast to quasiparticle approaches which require additional input to access transport coeffcients @xcite . ) in considering an ansatz of gravity+scalar as framework of effective dual models to pure non - abelian gauge thermo - field theories within a bottom - up approach one has to adjust either the potential of the dilaton field , or a metric function , or the dilaton profile .",
    "the improved holographic qcd ( ihqcd ) model , developed in @xcite ( for a review cf .",
    "@xcite ) is a particularly successful realisation of such a setting .",
    "the potential of ihqcd @xcite was constructed to match the thooft limit yang - mills @xmath8 function to two - loop order ( which determines the functional form and two parameters ) in the near - conformal ( small thooft coupling ) region , while the zero - temperature ( large thooft coupling ) behavior is fixed by demanding confinement and a linear glueball spectrum .",
    "a potential smoothly interpolating between the two asymptotic regions was shown in @xcite to well reproduce the @xmath9 yang - mills plasma equation of state @xcite , where remaining free parameters were fixed by comparing to the latent heat and scaled pressure from the lattice .",
    "within ihqcd , zero - temperature confining geometries exhibit a first - order thermodynamic phase transition @xcite .",
    "a different type of dilaton potentials was considered in @xcite , where near the boundary the potential accounts for a massive scalar field and the spacetime asymptotes to pure @xmath10 .",
    "the potential parameters were matched to the velocity of sound as suggested by the hadron resonance gas model and the dimension of @xmath11 at a finite scale @xcite and reproduce the velocity of sound of 2 + 1 flavor qcd , whereas in @xcite the matching to the su(3 ) yang - mills equation of state @xcite has been accomplished . in ihqcd ,",
    "the marginal operator dual to @xmath12 is @xmath13 @xcite , while in @xcite and here the dual operator @xmath14 is interpreted as a relevant deformation of the boundary theory lagrangian . in @xcite , instead of",
    "the dilaton potential , an ansatz for a metric function of the five - dimensional gravity action is selected and consequences for the boundary theory are explored .",
    "the previous benchmark lattice data @xcite ( up to @xmath15 ) and further su(@xmath16 ) data for @xmath17 @xcite ( up to @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 @xcite ( up to @xmath20 ) are for @xmath9 now supplemented and extended up to @xmath21 @xcite . here",
    "we are going to adjust precisely the dilaton potential to the new lattice data @xcite in the temperature range up to @xmath22 , thus catching the strong - coupling regime , as envisaged as relevant also in @xcite .",
    "we discard completely a recourse to the @xmath8 function .",
    "such an approach can be considered as a convenient parameterization of the equation of state .",
    "once the potential is adjusted , it qualifies for further studies , e.g.  of transport coefficients .",
    "our goal is accordingly the quantification of the bulk viscosity in the lhc relevant region , in particular near to @xmath23 , and a comparison with results of the quasiparticle model @xcite .",
    "the gravity dual to @xmath9 yang - mills theory is not known .",
    "instead , since in the large-@xmath16 and large thooft coupling limits a more generic string theory reduces to classical gravity , one presently resorts to a gravitation theory in a five - dimensional space , constructed in such a manner to accomodate certain selected features of the holographically emerging boundary field theory . as in the models",
    "@xcite , one often considers the ads / qcd correspondence as deformation of the original ads / cft correspondence @xcite by additional ( relevant or marginal ) operators which allow a qualitative study of qcd or yang - mills properties in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "conclusions for the latter theories should be drawn with caution : for instance , in the perturbative regime of the ( large-@xmath16 ) boundary theory , the gravity theory is expected to become strongly coupled and , consequently , finite string scale corrections may arise ; if one also leaves the thooft limit , stringy loop corrections may matter . having these disclaimers in mind",
    ", we nevertheless study quantitatively the bulk viscosity in a bottom - up setting matched solely to @xmath9 yang - mills thermodynamics within @xmath24 .",
    "the potential asymptotics of gubser - nellore @xcite and ihqcd @xcite models are different both in the near - boundary region i.e.  at high temperatures and also deep in the bulk i.e.  at low temperatures . when adjusting the potential in an intermediate region suitable for @xmath24 one would like to know whether it is important to incorporate a certain kind of asymptotics , or whether they have little influence .",
    "put another way , to what extent does a fit to lattice data on @xmath24 determine the potential ? here , we do not attempt to solve the general problem of computing the potential from a given equation of state , but instead show that various potentials which contain a certain unique relevant section lead to nearly identical equations of state in the corresponding temperature region .",
    "transport properties of the matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc are important to characterize precisely such novel states of a strongly interacting medium besides the equation of state .",
    "the impact of the bulk viscosity on the particle spectra and differential elliptic flows has been recently discussed in @xcite and found to be sizeable in @xcite , in particular for higher - order collective flow harmonics .",
    "the bulk viscosity enters also a new soft - photon emission mechanism @xcite via the conformal anomaly , thus offering a solution to the photon-@xmath25 puzzle ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details and references ) .",
    "compilations of presently available lattice qcd results of viscosities can be found in @xcite .",
    "the action @xmath26 ( the hawking - gibbons term is omitted ) leads , with the ansatz for the infinitesimal line element squared in riemann space @xmath27 , to the field equations quoted in @xcite under ( 25a - 25c ) ; the equation of motion ( 25d ) follows from the derivative of ( 25c ) with insertion of ( 25a - 25c ) . here",

    "here , we present a new potential @xmath194 , designed to reproduce also the lattice data in the confined phase : @xmath195 since we are not interested in the high - temperature regime @xmath196 , we choose a simple interpolation from @xmath197 to @xmath198 . the latter value is taken as a fit parameter and fixes @xmath199 and @xmath200 by the requirement that @xmath201 should be differentiable at @xmath165 .",
