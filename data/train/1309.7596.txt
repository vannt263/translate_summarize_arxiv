    "recently , the besiii collaboration claimed that four charged charmonium - like resonances @xcite were observed in the invariance mass spectra of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which were respectively referred as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . among them , the @xmath10 has been confirmed by the belle collaboration @xcite and the cleo - c experiment @xcite .",
    "so far it is still early to tell whether @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as well @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are the same state or not .",
    "moreover , in very recently , the @xmath13 , which was first observed by belle collaboration @xcite , is confirmed in lhcb experiment with about 13.9 @xmath14 of significance @xcite .",
    "the charmonium - like resonances are of particular interest as they facilitate not only investigating the dynamics of interaction between light quarks and heavy quarks , but also the testing of the standard model itself . until now",
    ", their inner structures have not been well determined by theory . in the literature possible interpretations",
    "include molecular states @xcite , tetraquark states @xcite , and enhancement structures @xcite , etc .    in refs.@xcite ,",
    "@xmath13 was treated as a pure tetraquark state , since there is no open charm meson thresholds close to it .",
    "it is tempting to think this state to be a radial excitation of the @xmath10 , which was analyzed in the framework of qcd sum rules @xcite . of the hidden strange charmonium - like states ,",
    "the cdf collaboration observed a narrow structure @xmath15 near the @xmath16 threshold in the exclusive @xmath17 decay mode produced in the @xmath18 collision at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "a scalar molecular state constructed by @xmath1 with @xmath20 was proposed to interpret the @xmath15 @xcite soon after its observation , and the extracted mass coincided with the experimental data .    utilizing the qcd sum rules ,",
    "people have successfully estimated the mass of @xmath10 and @xmath12 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 currents respectively @xcite .",
    "these successes intrigue enormous interests of theorists .",
    "it is of great interest to note that these states indicate that a new class of hadrons has been observed , but without the strange flavor until now .",
    "namely , two resonances are expected to exist near the thresholds of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the quantum numbers @xmath2 . in this work ,",
    "we calculate their mass spectra with qcd sum rules , discuss the implications of our results and suggest their possible decay channels in the summary .",
    "we hope this work may be helpful to experiment in exploring the hidden strange charmonium - like states .",
    "primary formulae are presented after the introduction . in sec.iii ,",
    "the numerical results and related figures are shown .",
    "the last section is a short summary .",
    "this work considers @xmath23 and @xmath1 molecular states with @xmath2 via qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the calculations of the qcd sum rules are based on the correlator constructed by two hadronic currents . for an axial vector state ,",
    "the two - point correlation function is given by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a current with the quantum numbers @xmath2 : @xmath26 , \\label{eq2 } \\\\",

    "here @xmath27 , @xmath28 are color indices , and these currents keep closer relations respectively with @xmath10 and @xmath12 @xcite .    as @xmath29 is not a conserved current",
    ", the two - point correlation function has two independent lorentz structures @xcite : @xmath30 where the invariant functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively related to the spin-0 and spin-1 mesons . in order to study the @xmath33 molecular state ,",
    "@xmath32 was utilized .",
    "the fundamental assumption of the qcd sum rules is the principle of quark - hadron duality .",
    "accordingly , on the one hand , the correlation function @xmath32 is obtained at the hadron level where the mass and coupling constant of the hadron are introduced .",
    "it may be calculated at the quark - gluon level , in which the operator product expansion ( ope ) is employed .    on the hadron side , after separating out the ground state contributions from the pole terms , the correlation function @xmath32 is obtained as a dispersion integral over a physical regime , @xmath34 in which @xmath35 is the mass of @xmath0 or @xmath1 molecular state with @xmath2 , and @xmath36 is the spectral density which contains contributions from the higher excited states and the continuum states , @xmath37 is the threshold of the higher excited states and continuum states , and the coupling constant @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the lowset lying @xmath33 @xmath0 or @xmath1 molecular state .    on the quark - gluon side ,",
    "the correlation function @xmath32 can be expressed as a dispersion relation : @xmath41 in which @xmath42 / \\pi$ ] and @xmath43 here @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote those contributions of the correlation function which have no imaginary parts but have nontrivial values under the borel transform .",
    "it should be mentioned that in principle the four - gluon operator , the @xmath47 , also belongs to the dimension - eight condensate , however , in practice we find it is only 1% of the mixed condensate @xmath48 in magnitude , and hence the four gluon condensate is neglected in the evaluation of this work .    after making a borel transform of the quark - gluon side : @xmath49    to consider the effects induced by the mass of the strange quark , terms which are linear in the strange quark mass @xmath50 are utilized in the following calculations .",
    "for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecular states , we put the concrete forms of spectral densities in eq.([spectral - density ] ) into the appendix .    performing the borel",
    "transform on the hadron side ( eq.([hadron ] ) ) and matching it to eq.([spectral - density ] ) , the resultant sum rule for the mass of the hidden strange molecular state h with @xmath33 is : @xmath51 where h represents the @xmath0 or @xmath1 molecular state and @xmath52",
    "in the numerical calculation , the values of the condensates and the quark masses are used as @xcite : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . here",
    ", the strange quark mass is the current quark mass in a mass - independent substraction scheme such as @xmath62 at the scale @xmath63 , whereas the charm and bottom quark masses are the running masses in the @xmath62 scheme . to provide greater clarity of choosing these parameters , the primary sources for determining these parameters can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to determinate the borel parameter @xmath64 and the threshold parameter @xmath37 , we used the following limit constraints , which is the standard procedure for qcd sum rules analysis .",
    "the sum rule parameter @xmath65 is utilized in our analysis . in the qcd sum rules , for choosing the threshold @xmath37 and the parameter @xmath66",
    ", there are two criteria @xcite .",
    "first , the convergence of the ope is retained .",
    "therefore , in order to determine their convergence , one needs to compare the relative contributions of each term to the total contributions of the ope side .",
    "the second criterion to constrain the @xmath66 is that the pole contribution ( pc ) , defined as the pole contribution divided by the total contribution ( pole plus continuum ) , is larger than the continuum contribution . in order to safely eliminate the contributions of the higher excited and continuum states ,",
    "the pc is generally greater than @xmath67 @xcite .    to find a proper value for @xmath68",
    ", we carry out a similar analysis as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the continuum threshold is connected to the mass of the studied state by the relation @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is about 0.6 gev , various @xmath68 satisfying this constraint are taken into account . among these values",
    ", one needs then to find out the proper one which has an optimal window for borel parameter @xmath64 .",
    "that is , within this window , the physical quantity , here the molecular mass @xmath71 , is independent of the borel parameter @xmath64 as much as possible . through the above procedure one",
    "obtains the central value of @xmath68 .",
    "however , in practice , in the qcd sum rules calculation , it is normally acceptable to vary the @xmath68 by @xmath72  @xcite , which gives the lower and upper bounds and hence the uncertainties of @xmath68 .",
    "the ope convergences are illustrated in fig.[convergence ] respectively for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "complying with the first criterion , the upper limit constraints of @xmath66 are @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .     for the @xmath0 molecular state with @xmath77 ,",
