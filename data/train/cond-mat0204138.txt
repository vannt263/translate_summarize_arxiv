    "the flow of granular material in a rotating cylinder is of particular interest since on the one hand it reveals many interesting to physicists phenomena , on the other hand in chemical engineering widely used tumbling ball mills base on the motion of iron spheres moving in rotating cylinders .",
    "hence it has been intensively experimentally subjected by both engineers  @xcite and physicists  @xcite .",
    "the present paper contains results of two dimensional molecular dynamics of grains moving in an uniformly rotating cylinder .",
    "recently rajchenbach  @xcite has shown experimentally that the inclination of sand flowing in a rotating cylinder depends nonlinearly on the angular velocity of the cylinder .",
    "if the angular velocity is smaller than a certain threshold the sand moves stick  slip like , i.e. there is no continuous flow but there are avalanches of different size , the angle of inclination fluctuates . using high speed recording of polydisperse iron spheres in a tumbling",
    "ball mill rolf  @xcite observed that the flow forms convection cells .",
    "they found that the size and the number of the cells depend on the rotation velocity .",
    "we will show that our simulations agree with the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "traditional molecular dynamics simulations of granular material use polydisperse spherical grains , examples can be found in  @xcite and many references therein . applying a recently introduced model for a nonspherical grain",
    "@xcite which deforms elastically under pressure and dissipates energy during collisions our results agree better with the experiment than the simulations using spheres for the case of low angular velocity .",
    "nonspherical grains in molecular dynamics simulations of granular material have been introduced already by gallas and sokoowski  @xcite in an investigation of the angle of repose of a sand heap . in their model a grain consists of two spheres which are connected by a stiff bar , their results agree with ours .",
    "in the simulations we assume that the grains are ideal spheres . to describe the interaction between colliding particles we use a simple ansatz given by cundall and strack  @xcite and haff and werner @xcite .",
    "two grains @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the positions @xmath2 and @xmath3 will interact only if they touch each other , i.e. if the distance between the center points is smaller than the sum of their radii @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 for this case the force between particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 moving with the velocities @xmath7 and @xmath8 and rotating with angular velocities @xmath9 and @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 with the normal force @xmath12 and the shear force @xmath13 for the relative velocity @xmath14 of the particle surfaces one can write @xmath15 the effective mass of the particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given by @xmath16 and the resulting momenta @xmath17 and @xmath17 for the particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 is the young modulus , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the phenomenological normal and shear friction coefficients , @xmath23 stands for the coulomb friction parameter .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the particles deform each other slightly during collisions . to simulate three dimensional behavior we use the hertzian contact force @xcite which rises with the power 1.5 of the penetration depth @xmath24 .",
    "( [ eq_coulomb ] ) takes into account that the particles slide on each other for the case that the inequality @xmath25 holds , otherwise they roll .",
    "this behavior is due to the coulomb law .    for the integration of newtons equations of motion due to the forces @xmath26 given above we used a sixth order gear predictor  corrector algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this high accuracy is necessary since there is a short range interaction between the particles , a small inaccuracy in the calculation of the particle positions may cause large faults in the resulting forces . using algorithms of lower accuracy",
    "the system would become numerical unstable .",
    "the calculation of the rotation of the particles is not such sensitive since the angular velocity is very small in general , hence we applied a forth order algorithm only .    in the simulations we use for the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the radii of the particles are gauss distributed with the mean value @xmath31 .",
    "the chosen parameters are typical for a soft granular material .",
    "the model described above was applied to a simulation of granular material consisting of 2400 single grains moving in a clockwise rotating cylinder of diameter @xmath32 , the cylinder rotates with angular velocity @xmath33 .",

    "the color codes for the velocity of the particles , slow particles are drawn blue , fast are drawn red .",
    "as visible the velocity of the particles near the surface of the flow is nonuniform .",
    "the surface of the granular material is close to an even plane which is inclined by an angle @xmath34 .",
    "although the dynamics of the flow seems to be very regular the traces of the grains during the simulation are due to convection cells  ( fig.[strom_0.002 ] ) . since there are more than one cell they can not remain stable over a long time because all of them have the same sense of rotation and therefore they disturb each other",
    "this effect was observed experimentally too in the investigation of tumbling ball mills  @xcite .",
    "[ snap_sph0.1 ] and [ strom_0.1 ] show a snapshot and the plot of the traces of a simulation with angular velocity @xmath35 .",
    "the surface of the granular material is not an even plane anymore , but it becomes s  shaped .",
    "the same shape characteristic was observed in experiments by rajchenbach  @xcite . in the simulations for high angular velocity",
    "one finds only one large convection cell ( fig .",
    "[ strom_0.1 ] ) instead of several for lower angular velocity , this behavior is due to the experiment  @xcite .    after submitting this article we received a preprint by baumann , jobs and wolf  @xcite who applied the interesting simulation method by visscher and bolsterli  @xcite ( improved version  @xcite ) to the problem of the rotating cylinder .",
    "they found convection cells as well .    because the surface of the simulated granular flow is not a perfect plane even for very slow rotation we have to determine the inclination indirectly .",
    "it is given by @xmath36 where ( @xmath37  ,  @xmath38 ) are the coordinates of the center of mass point and ( @xmath39  ,  @xmath40 ) is the rotation center of the cylinder ( fig .  [ w_m ] ) .",

    "the profile is not close to an even plane but s  shaped .",
    "although the cylinder rotates with a constant angular velocity the flow of the surface particles varies irregularly with time and space , this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fluss_sph ] .",
    "each horizontal strip of this figure shows the velocity distribution along the surface of the flow . as before red color means high velocity , blue means low velocity .",

    "experimental observations , however , show that the flow at the surface of granular material in a rotating cylinder is stick  slip like , i.e. there are avalanches of different size going down the surface .",
    "our simulations with spherical grains can not reproduce this behavior .",
    "hence we apply another model where the grains are not simple spheres but of more complex shape .",
    "each nonspherical particle @xmath46 consists of four spheres of radius @xmath47 located at the corners of a square of size @xmath48 and one additional sphere in the center of the square ( fig .",

    "( [ eq_coulomb ] ) which introduces static friction into the interaction forces is not applied in the simulations using nonspherical grains .",

    "[ snap_geo0.002 ] shows a snapshot of the simulation .",
    "obviously the inclination is approximately twice the inclination observed for spherical grains .",
    "the particles at the surface move with much higher velocities than the others .",
    "this is due to an avalanche going down the surface in the moment when the snapshot was done .    the equivalent picture to fig .",
    "[ fluss_sph ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fluss_geo ] .",
    "the flow is irregular in time and space too but one finds time intervals where the surface particles move with high velocities and other intervals where the particle velocities , i.e the flow at the surface , are almost zero .",
