    "hh  110 is a herbig - haro ( hh ) jet emerging from the southern edge of the l1617 dark cloud in the orion b complex .",
    "both observational and theoretical works have been carried out since its discovery by @xcite , because unlike most of the well - known stellar jets , hh  110 has a peculiar morphology , among other properties .",
    "the morphology of hh  110 in the h@xmath2 and [ sii ]  lines is very complex , starting in a collimated chain of knots .",
    "the emission away from the collimated region has a more chaotic structure and widens within a cone of unusually large opening angle ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "hh  110 appreciable wiggles along the @xmath0 4  arcmin jet length .",
    "the knots are all embedded in fainter emitting gas , which outlines the whole flow , more reminiscent of a turbulent outflow .",
    "most of the knots detected in ground - based images are spatially resolved into several components in the higher spatial resolution hst images ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the transverse cross - section of hh  110 shows a significant asymmetry , the eastern border is sharp and poorly resolved , whereas the strong knotty emission mostly appears towards the western side .",
    "hh  110 is the only known hh that shows a faint filament of emission lying parallel at @xmath0 10 arcsec to the east of the northern a - c knots , which probably represents a weak secondary or even a fossil flow channel @xcite .",
    "attempts to find the driving source of hh  110 have failed at optical , near infrared and radio continuum wavelengths .    a scenario that accounts for the singular morphology of hh  110",
    "was first outlined by @xcite .",
    "these authors proposed that hh  110 originates from the deflection ( deflection angle @xmath4 ) of the adjacent hh  270 jet through a grazing collision with a dense molecular clump of gas .",
    "the feasibility of this scenario has been further reinforced from the results of numerical simulations , which model the emission arising from the collision of a jet with a dense molecular clump ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , analysis of further data are also in agreement with this scenario .",
    "first , a high - density clump of gas around the region where the hh  270 jet changes its direction to emerge as hh  110 has been detected through high - density tracer molecules ( in hco@xmath5 , by @xcite , and in nh@xmath6 , by @xcite ) .",
    "second , results from proper motion determination are also consistent with the jet / cloud collision scenario ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a recent work of @xcite that included laboratory experiments has given further support to the jet / cloud collision scenario .",
    "hh  110 is a good candidate to search for the observational footprints of gas entrainment and turbulence by analysing the kinematics and the excitation conditions along and across the jet flow .",
    "some works were performed in the recent past from long - slit spectroscopy and fabry - perot data .",
    "the kinematics and physical conditions , both along the outflow axis and at four positions across the jet beam , were explored from long - slit spectroscopy by @xcite , who found very complex structures .",
    "@xcite explored the spatial distribution and the characteristic knot sizes , as well as the spatial behaviour of the velocity and line width , by performing a wavelet analysis of fabry - perot data , but only covering the h@xmath2 line .",
    "their results indicated that most of the h@xmath2 kinematics can be explained by assuming an axially peaked mean flow velocity , on which are superposed low - amplitude turbulent velocities .",
    "in addition , their results are suggestive of the presence on an outer envelope that appears to be a turbulent boundary layer . finally , @xcite compared images from laboratory jet experiments with numerical simulations and with long - slit , high - resolution optical spectra obtained along hh  110 .",
    "they found a good agreement between the shock structures observed in hh  110 and those derived from experiments of a supersonic jet deflected by a dense obstacle .    in order to further advance on our understanding of hh  110 ,",
    "this object was included as a target within a program of integral field spectroscopy of herbig ",
    "haro objects using the potsdam multi - aperture spectrophotometer ( pmas ) in the wide - field ifu mode pmas fibre pack ( ppak ) .",
    "the data obtained from this ifs hh observing program give a full spatial coverage of the hh  110 emission in several lines ( h@xmath2 , [ nii ]  and [ sii ] ) , thus allowing us to perform a more complete analysis of the kinematics and physical conditions through the whole flow than all the previous works .",

    "the wavelength calibration was performed by using the sky emission lines found in the observed wavelength range .",
    "the accuracy achieved for the wavelength calibration was better than @xmath18   ( @xmath19 km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "furthermore , the large scale diffuse emission from this orion region was subtracted from our data by using the signal acquired through the 36 additional sky fibres .",
    "observations of a standard star were used to perform a relative flux calibration .",
    "the four ifu pointings were merged into a mosaic using our own routines , developed for this task ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "some morphological differences have been found in previous narrow - band images of hh  110 between the h@xmath2+[nii ]  and [ sii ]  emissions . in an attempt to explore these differences , we obtained ifs - derived narrow - band images for each of the emission lines included in the observed spectral range ( h@xmath2 , [ nii]@xmath20 6584   and [ sii ]  @xmath20 6716,6731  ) .",
    "for each position , the flux of the line was obtained by integrating the signal over the wavelength range of the line ( @xmath20 6558.36565.9   for h@xmath2 ; @xmath20 6579.66585.8   for [ nii ] ; @xmath20 6712.86718.1   for [ sii]@xmath206716 and @xmath20 6727.26733.1   for [ sii ]  @xmath206731 ) , and subtracting a continuum , obtained from the adjacent wavelength range free of line emission .",
    "the narrow - band maps of hh  110 obtained from the ifs data ( fig .  [ flux ] ) are in good agreement with those obtained for this jet through ground - based , narrow - band images by different authors ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , since the ifs data allow us to properly isolate the h@xmath2 line emission from the [ nii ]  lines , we obtained the first known image of hh  110 in the [ nii ]  emission . in this sense , the ifs maps are better suited for comparing the jet morphology in the h@xmath2 and [ sii]emissions , since the h@xmath2 emission is not affected by the contamination from [ nii ]  lines .",
    "most of the hh  110 knots were detected in all the emission lines , although the brightness varies among different lines , being a signature of the excitation conditions , as we will discuss later .",
    "there are a few emission features whose brightness in the [ nii ]  and [ sii ]  lines should be very weak relative to the h@xmath2 brightness and were barely detected or not detected at all in the [ nii]and [ sii ]  lines , namely : ( i ) the knot k , appearing quite isolated towards the western outflow edge , but outside the lower - brightness emission surrounding the knots , and ( ii ) the extended features towards the east of knots a to c , labeled x and y. these faint h@xmath2 features were first detected in the ground - based , narrow - band image of @xcite .",

    "emission in the h@xmath2 line , having neither significant contributions from the extended nearby continuum ( that was removed ) nor from [ nii ]  lines ( if any , it should be below the 3@xmath21 rms level ) .",
    "the knots are found surrounded by a lower - brightness nebular emission for all the emission lines .",
    "this more diffuse emission also shows a shock - excited spectrum , and likely arises from the gas in the boundary layer that is being incorporated into the outflow . the large scale",
    ", low - velocity diffuse emission component detected in the orion region was removed from our data and is not contributing to this low - brightness , interknot emission structure we are referring to . figure  [ flux ] shows that the cross section along all of the jet appears wider in h@xmath2 than in the other lines , which all have similar spatial widths .",
    "since with the present spatial resolution the sizes of the knots are similar at all lines , the wider h@xmath2 cross - section of the jet should arise from the contribution of the low - brightness , nebular emission . in our maps , this weaker emission appears spatially more extended in h@xmath2 than in the rest of the observed lines .",
    "this fact could be due , in part , to the weakness of the [ nii ]  and [ sii ]  emissions , which makes the emission undetectable in our maps ( up to the 3@xmath21 rms level ) farther away from the knots .",
    "first results on the physical conditions of hh  110 were obtained through long - slit spectroscopy acquired along the jet outflow ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and at a several positions across the jet beam ( @xcite ) .",
    "the widths of the slits used in these observations were 2 and 1.5 arcsec , respectively . in both works , the [ sii]/h@xmath2 ratios derived for the knots intersected by the slit along the jet axis outflow range from @xmath00.2 to @xmath00.7 .",
    "these ratios correspond to an intermediate / high degree of excitation ( @xcite ) .",
    "a trend was found of an increasing [ sii]/h@xmath2 ratio ( hence a decrease of the excitation ) moving from knot c to knot m , where the lowest excitation was detected .",
    "a decrease of this ratio ( hence an increase of the excitation ) was found beyond knot m. in general , the values derived in both works are well consistent , except for knots a and n , where the [ sii]/h@xmath2 ratio reported by @xcite is significantly higher ( by a factor of two ) than the ratio reported by @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising since the excitation conditions should change significantly within arcsecs across the jet beam , as first revealed by the spectroscopy of the jet cross section performed by @xcite .",
    "thus , the sampled regions of knots a and n might not coincide in both observations .",
    "furthermore , no clear trends for the excitation structure of the jet cross sections were found from the spectra acquired by @xcite .",
    "these authors found a complex structure at the four positions across the jet beam , where the spectra were obtained .",
    "to look for a more complete picture of the entire spatial structure of the excitation and density of the jet , we obtained the [ sii](6716 + 6731)/h@xmath2 and [ nii](6548 + 6584)/h@xmath2 line - ratio maps from the ifu data ( fig.[cfi ] ) .",
    "the line - ratio maps were created by dividing spaxel - by - spaxel the corresponding flux - integrated line maps ( all the spaxels with values below 5@xmath21 were blanked before to obtain the line - ratio map ) . at the weakest knots , the estimated uncertainties are 10% and 15% in the [ sii](6716 + 6731)/h@xmath2 and [ nii](6548 + 6584)/h@xmath2 line - ratio values respectively .",
    "the [ sii]/h@xmath2 and [ nii]/h@xmath2 maps clearly reveal the complex excitation structure of the emission that was only barely outlined from long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "several facts should be remarked : ( i ) for the knots that were sampled through long - slit spectroscopy , the line - ratio values derived from the ifs data around the peak positions are in good agreement with those derived from the long - slit spectra . for knots a and n , the ratios obtained from the ifs data are in better agreement with those derived by @xcite than with those derived by @xcite ; ( ii ) ifs line - ratio maps revealed some regions in which the degree of gas excitation is low .",
    "in particular , the highest [ sii]/h@xmath2 ratios ( @xmath22 1.5 ) are found around knot h and slightly lower ratios , which are also compatible with a low degree of excitation , are found around knots r and s. this wider range of excitation degree could not be detected by previous long - slit observations , which did not sample these low excitation regions ; ( iii ) no clear systematic trend in the spatial distribution of the excitation was found neither along the jet outflow nor across the jet beam .",
    "however , the integrated [ sii]/h@xmath2 and [ nii]/h@xmath2 maps indicate that the excitation is higher for the northern jet knots a to d ( where the outflow has a higher collimation ) than beyond knot e , from the region where the outflow widens and the knots begin to lose their alignment relative to the axis direction traced by knots a - c . for this jet region ( i.e.  from knots e to q ) the line ratio maps show some signatures of an increment in the excitation moving outwards , from the knot peak to the eastern knot border and to the interknot .",
    "the line ratio maps are thus suggestive of a decrease in the excitation from east to west across the jet beam .",
    "this is true for all knots , except around knot i ( at the western jet border ) , where the excitation is higher and similar to that derived in the northern ( a to d ) knots .",
    "the spatial distribution of the electron density ( @xmath23 ) is traced by the [ sii ]  6716/6731 map .",
    "figure [ cfi ] shows the map created from the ifu data ( with the assumptions mentioned before for the excitation maps ) . at the weakest knots , the estimated uncertainty is 15% . the values found range from @xmath0 0.9 to @xmath0 1.4 , which correspond to @xmath23 ranging from 1000 to 50 @xmath24 respectively ( these values were derived using the temden task of the iraf / stsdas package , and assuming @xmath25  k ) .",
    "the electron density can not be properly evaluated around the knot r region , because the derived line ratios are higher than the values for which the [ sii ]  6716/6731 is density sensitive in the low - density limit . in general , the trend found is a decrease in the @xmath23 , moving along the jet from north to south .",
    "this result is consistent with the density behaviour of the knots derived from the long - slit spectra by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the spatial distribution of the density obtained through ifs ( fig.[cfi ] ) is more complex than that outlined from long - slit spectroscopy , and could not be properly described based on this kind of observations .",
    "the density map indicates that , in general , the electron densities are higher around the knot peak positions and decrease towards the edges of the knots and towards the interknot gas . across the jet beam , a trend is observed in the knots peaking towards the west side of the axis defined by knots a  c ( e.g.  knots e , i , n , p ) that are denser than knots peaking towards the east side of this axis ( e.g.  knots d , j , o , q ) .",
    "the density map also shows some local departures of this general trend that are significant .",
    "in particular , it should be noted that the highest @xmath23 is reached around knot e ( i.e.  @xmath0  40  arcsec south from knot a ) .",
    "in fact , the ifu data revealed an enhancement in the electron density , reaching @xmath23 values of @xmath1  1000  @xmath24 and with a maximum of @xmath1  1300 @xmath24 located @xmath1 3 arcsec southwest of the knot e peak intensity .",
    "this denser clump , extending over @xmath1 30 arcsec@xmath8 , appears well delimited at its eastern edge , as shown by a sharp fall of @xmath23 , which reaches values of @xmath1 200300  @xmath24 by only moving @xmath1 2 arcsec east from the e peak intensity .",
    "in addition , although @xmath23 gently decreases from knots a ( @xmath0  600  @xmath24 ) to h ( @xmath0  400  @xmath24 ) , the knot i , southwest of all of these knots , has a @xmath23 similar to knot b ( @xmath0  500  @xmath24 ) , while knot d , southeast of knot c , has similar low values ( @xmath0  150  @xmath24 ) to those found at the southern , more rarefied knots , beyond knot n.        the emission lines at most of the positions mapped in hh  110 show asymmetric profiles that can not be properly fitted by a single gaussian .",
    "hence , we calculated the flux - weighted mean radial velocity ( or first - order intensity momentum ) instead of the line centroids of a gaussian fit , and the flux - weighted rms width of the line ( or second - order intensity momentum ) , proportional to the fwhm of the line , and described the integrated velocity field of the jet  km  s@xmath9  for the parent cloud has been taken from @xcite . ] from these intensity momenta .",
    "hh  110 shows a velocity field behaviour very similar in all the mapped lines ( fig .",
    "[ vel ] ) .",
    "the radial velocities are blueshifted ( @xmath26 ranging from @xmath0  10 to 80  km  s@xmath9  in h@xmath2 ) , with an increase towards more blueshifted values moving from north to south .",
    "velocities that were derived from h@xmath2 are blueshifted by @xmath0  20  km  s@xmath9relative to those derived from the [ nii ]   and [ sii ]  ( the velocities derived from these two lines are similar ) .",
    "the velocity offset found between h@xmath2 and [ sii ]  is not an artifact caused by an inaccurate wavelength calibration of the ifs data , since it has been also found in long - slit , higher resolution data ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a more detailed inspection of the velocity maps reveals a more complex structure of the velocity field : ( i ) the less blueshifted velocities ( @xmath26 @xmath0  10 to 15  km  s@xmath9  in h@xmath2 ) are found around the northern emissions x , y and in knot d , all of them located towards the eastern side of the jet axis direction traced by the knots a  c ; ( ii ) conversely , more blueshifted velocities ( @xmath26  @xmath0  50 to 60  km  s@xmath9  in h@xmath2 ) appear around the regions of knot o and q , which also are located at the eastern jet side .",
    "even more blueshifted velocities ( up to @xmath26  @xmath0  80  km  s@xmath9  in h@xmath2 ) are found around knots i and k , located at the western jet border , quite outside of the main jet body .    the maps of the fwhm for the h@xmath2 and [ sii ]  @xmath20  6716   lines obtained from the second - order intensity momentum are shown in fig .  [ fwc ] .",
    "maps were corrected from the instrumental profile by subtracting it in quadrature spaxel - by - spaxel .",
    "spaxels with values below a 5@xmath21 rms level were blanked .",
    "the spatial distribution of the fwhm shows a complex pattern in both lines . in general , widths are broader for h@xmath2 than for the [ sii ]  lines .",
    "the fwhm of the h@xmath2 ranges from 30 to 90  km  s@xmath9 , being in good agreement with those found by @xcite from fabry - perot data and with those derived by @xcite from long - slit , high - resolution spectra . the northern knots ( a to c )",
    "present the largest values ( 8090  km  s@xmath9 ) of the fwhm , decreasing towards the south of the outflow ( up to 3040  km  s@xmath9around knots m and q ) .",
    "in fact , the fwhm around the arc - shaped , southern s emission region should be even narrower , but the widths could not be properly evaluated due to the instrumental line profile .",
    "like for other jet properties , this general trend is not well fulfilled by the whole outflow : a region having significant narrow lines , their widths being close to detection limit , is also found around knot d , while higher fwhm values ( 90  km  s@xmath9 , similar to the widths derived around knot a ) are found around knot i. concerning the fwhm of the [ sii]lines , their values range from 20 to 70  km  s@xmath9and are in agreement with the results of @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the fwhm values for the [ sii ]  lines are similar to the fwhm h@xmath2 map .",
    "some key differences in fwhm between h@xmath2 and [ sii ]   should be mentioned : ( i ) the widths of the [ sii ]  lines drop significantly around knot c , where its value diminished by a factor of two relative to that found around knot a , while knots c and a have comparable fwhms in h@xmath2 ; ( ii ) knots m and q have very similar fwhm values in [ sii ]  and h@xmath2 , while the general trend for the rest of the knots is the h@xmath2 line being wider ( by 1520  km  s@xmath9typically ) than the [ sii ]  line .      in an attempt to compare long - slit and ifs data ,",

    "the knots show significant differences in their physical conditions , as inferred from their relative line intensities . moreover , the lines present asymmetric profiles that in some knots are suggestive of being double - peaked ( see , e.g.  knots h , i ) although the profiles can not be resolved because of the spectral resolution of the data .",

    "this trend is consistent with the velocity behaviour found in previous works ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "in particular , the isolated knot k ( found outside the jet body ) has a blueshifted radial velocity more negative than the rest of the knots , and its deviation from the general trend is statistically significant",

    "knot k deviates from the fit by @xmath30 .",
    "this deviation is statistically significant for a sample of 19 knots .",
    "then , a new linear fit was calculated after removing knot k from the sample ( i.e.  18 knots ) .",
    "we obtained values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the knots that deviate more than @xmath33 from this new fit are knot o ( @xmath34 deviation ) , i ( @xmath35 deviation ) , and k shows now a @xmath36 deviation .",
    "unfortunately there is no proper motion determination for knot k that would allow us to calculate the projection angle of its motion .",
    "hence , the current data do not allow us to discern whether the kinematic behaviour of knot k , with a radial velocity appreciably blueshifted as compared with the rest of the knots , can be only attributed to the jet geometry ( i.e.  to projection effects ) .",
    "recently , @xcite imaged the hh 110 region in the h@xmath37 2.12 @xmath38 m line .",
    "they report a weak jet emerging from the source irs1 ( to the west of hh 110 ) and extending from north to south .",
    "this weak jet seems to be pointing at knot k. in conclusion , there are some indications ( a location isolated from the jet flow , and a kinematics significantly different from the rest of the knots ) that knot k could be related to irs1 , but its relationship with the hh 110 outflow can not be fully discarded based on the results presented in this work .    the full spatial velocity ( @xmath39 ) and an upper limit for the angle @xmath40 between the knot motion and the plane of sky ( @xmath40=0@xmath41 when the flow moves in the plane of the sky ) were calculated from the knot proper motions , derived from multiepoch [ sii ]  narrow - band images ( @xcite ) and the radial velocities , derived in this work from the [ sii ]  lines at the position of the knot intensity peak ( the typical errors for @xmath40 and @xmath39   are @xmath0  6@xmath41 and @xmath0  12  km  s@xmath9  respectively ) .",

    "the region around knot b could correspond to the region where the outflow is excavating a channel through the dense molecular clump ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and might trace the location where the jet collides with the cloud . hence",
    ", significant deviations from the kinematics trend that account for the jet / cloud interaction should be expected at this location .",
    "this may explain the appreciably low spatial velocity found for knot b. concerning the other two knots with deviations less significant , knot o also has a highly blueshifted radial velocity , ( although within a 1@xmath21 deviation from the radial velocity fit , see fig .  [ velpeak ] ) .",
    "the low @xmath39  at knot e mostly corresponds to the tangential velocity component ( see also fig .",
    "[ velpeak ] ) as was mentioned before , the highest values of the electron density in the outflow , measured from the integrated [ sii ]  line ratio , are found around knot e location .",

    "[ angulo ] ]      as already mentioned in  3.2.1 , the line profiles show some degree of asymmetry relative to a single - gaussian shape that varies from knot to knot .",
    "this can be seen for the h@xmath2 and [ sii ]   lines of the spectra extracted at the position of the peak intensity of each knot ( fig .",
    "[ espknotp ] ) .",
    "the analysis of spectral line asymmetries through line bisectors provides a strong tool to understand the shape and origin of line profiles , and is widely used in stellar astrophysics ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to make more clear the asymmetries of the hh  110 line profiles , we calculated the line bisectors for the h@xmath2 line at the position of the knot peak intensity .",
    "the results are shown for each profile in fig .",
    "[ bise_ha ] .",

    "there is low - velocity emission excess , with the line bisector tilted towards redshifted wavelengths ( referred as knots having  red asymmetry  : knots e , i and q ) .",
    "finally , a few knots show a nearly symmetric profile ( knots b and n ) . such line - profile behaviour might be explained in part by the combined effect of the knot velocity and flow inclination at the knot position .",
    "some clues can be obtained from the work of @xcite , who modeled the effect of varying the velocity and the inclination angle of the flow in the plane of the sky on the h@xmath2 line profiles emerging from bow shocks .",
    "they found that the asymmetry of the line profile increases with the velocity of the shock , and with the inclination angle .",
    "resolved , double - peaked profiles are only found for velocities higher than @xmath47  km  s@xmath9and for angles greater than @xmath48 . furthermore , moderate variations on the inclination angle result in significant effect in the shape of the line profile . for a given angle ,",
    "the shape of the asymmetry changes from  red  to  blue  depending on the velocity : e.g.  for low inclination angles ( @xmath49 ) , a  red asymmetry  is obtained for low velocities ( @xmath50 km  s@xmath9 ) and a  blue asymmetry  for higher velocities ( @xmath51 km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "interestingly , most of the hh  110 knots showing a  blue asymmetry  in the line profile correspond to knots having high velocity ( @xmath39  @xmath44  160  km  s@xmath9 ,  e.g. : a , c , j , o ) or inclination angle @xmath52 ( e.g. : r , s ) .",

    "note in addition that some pairs of knots with close values of @xmath39  and @xmath40 show very similar profiles , as is the case of knots c and j , and of knots h and l.    hence , there is a general agreement of the h@xmath2 line profiles observed in hh 110 with the obtained from the shock models of @xcite .",
    "however , other properties of the emission could also being contributing to the line shapes .",
    "for example , different morphologies of the bow emission , keeping all the other parameters constant , can give different line profiles , as shown by @xcite .",
    "they found that the bluntness at the apex and the radius of the tail are two important factors in determining the line profiles for the case of h@xmath37 lines arising from a bow - shock .",
    "in fact , @xcite found from laboratory jet experiments how the working surface of a deflected bow shock present complex emission structures as those observed in hh  110 .",
    "these structures give rise to different asymmetric line profiles , depending on the hh  110 knot and hence , on the shock velocity and projection angle .",

    "the estimated uncertainties are better than 25% in the [ nii]6584/h@xmath2 and 1015% in the [ sii](6716 + 6731)/h@xmath2 and [ sii ]  6716/6731 maps .",
    "figures [ csh ] and [ cnh ] display the [ sii](6716 + 6731)/h@xmath2 and [ nii]6584/h@xmath2 line - ratio channel maps , tracing the gas excitation as a function of the radial velocity .    the line - ratio maps for each velocity channel follow the spatial behaviour of the excitation that was already found in the integrated line - ratio maps ( fig .",

    "furthermore , the trend found for this region ( a decreasing excitation moving across the jet beam , from the eastern jet side to the west ) is now more clearly seen on each of the channel map .",

    "the [ sii ]  6716/6730 line - ratio channel maps ( fig .",
    "[ css ] ) trace the electron density of the emitting gas as a function of the radial velocity . in general",
    ", the spatial distribution of the density follows the same trends that were found from the integrated [ sii ]  6716/6730 line - ratio ( fig .",
    "[ cfi ] ) . in this sense",
    ", density decreases from north to south along the jet , but with some exception , e.g.  around knot e , where density is the largest .",
    "variations on the electron density also depend on the gas kinematics . for a given knot",

    "to conclude , the ifs data confirm the peculiar nature of hh  110 as compared with most of the stellar jets already observed .",
    "the most relevant results presented in this paper might be summarized as follows :    * these ifs data have allowed us to generate the first [ nii]narrow - band image of hh  110 currently obtained , which shows a similar jet cross section to the [ sii ]  emission .",
    "in addition , these data allow us to confirm that the faint filamentary emission labeled x and y , detected to the east of knots a  c , which probably corresponds to a  fossil ",
    "outflow channel , mainly should arise from  true",
    " h@xmath2 line emission .",
    "the contributions from nearby continuum or from the [ nii ]  lines , if any , should be very weak , as no emission was detected in [ nii ] , and the continuum contribution was previously removed . * the line - ratio maps derived from the integrated line intensities revealed complex spatial structures for the gas excitation and electron density .",
    "although the line ratios that trace gas excitation are indicative of an intermediate / high - excitation degree for most of the emission mapped , several regions of low - excitation emission are detected through the flow ( e.g.[sii]/h@xmath2  @xmath44  1.5 around knot h ) . in general , the [ sii ]",
    "line ratios correspond to low electron density values ( @xmath23  @xmath45  1000  @xmath24 ) and show smooth spatial variations",
    ". however , strong local enhancements of @xmath23 relative to its surroundings were detected at several locations ( e.g.  around knot e , where the @xmath23 value is about three times that of the surroundings ) . * radial velocities appear blueshifted , relative to the @xmath54  of the cloud , the modulus increasing with the distance to knot a , although with some appreciable local departures from this trend ( in particular , knot k ) .",
    "this systematic increase in radial velocity should not be interpreted as a sign of jet acceleration , since no similar trend was derived for proper motions .",
    "in fact , the trend found for tangential velocities goes in the opposite way ( decreasing velocity as a function of distance from knot a , with some appreciable local departures , e.g.  in knot b ) .",
    "thus , this apparent acceleration should be better attributed to a geometric effect : the interaction between the jet and the inhomogeneous ambient surroundings will lead to the deflection of the jet and therefore , to changes in the projection of the full spatial velocity along the line of sight ( radial velocity ) and along the plane of the sky ( tangential velocity ) . * in general",
    ", the line profiles are broader for h@xmath2 than for [ sii ] , and the fwhm in both lines decreases from the northern to the southern knots , although this trend is not fully systematic along the outflow . * we recalculated the full velocity and the motion direction relative to the plain of sky of the hh  110 knots using the [ sii ]  radial velocities , derived from the spectra extracted at the position of the knots peak intensity , together with knot proper motions , obtained from ground - based , multi - epoch [ sii ]  narrow - band images .",
    "we confirmed the general trend of a decrease in the velocity and an increment in the projection angle with distance from knot a , as found in previous works that used a more limited knot sample .",
    "significant departures from the trend are found in some knots .",
    "these knots could be tracing the loci where a stronger interaction between the jet and the inhomogeneous medium is taking place .",
    "* the channel maps showed that the emission spreads over different velocity ranges , depending on the line considered . in spite of that",
    ", the maps also showed that the morphology of the emission in each of the velocity channels is similar for all the lines , the strongest emission corresponds to the velocity interval @xmath120@xmath59@xmath54@xmath59 + 5  km  s@xmath9 , where significant emission from all the knots was detected .",
    "in addition , the previously unknown kinematics of the excitation and electron density along the full spatial extent of the outflow were obtained from the channel maps .",
    "the degree of excitation and the electron density appear to be anticorrelated with the velocity modulus , in the way that the emission from the gas moving faster ( either , at red or blueshifted velocities ) has higher excitation and lower density as compared to the emission from the gas moving at slower velocities , which appear denser and less excited .",
    "* from the ifs spectra extracted at appropriate spaxels , we were able to compare the physical conditions obtained from these data with those derived from previous long - slit and fabry - perot observations .",
    "the general trends followed by the properties of the emission and even the derived values of the observables are in good agreement at all the commonly sampled positions . however , the complex structure of the hh  110 kinematics and physical conditions , already outlined in previous works , has been now better characterized from this more complete ifs sampling .",
    "these data revealed significant variations of the kinematics and physical conditions over short distances that were not properly sampled by the long - slit data . *",
    "the emission lines have asymmetric profiles .",
    "the analysis of the h@xmath2 line profiles performed through the line bisectors method shows that the departure of the profile from a single - gaussian shape varies from knot to knot .",
    "we found that the shape of the profiles seems to be related to the full velocity and the viewing angle of the knot .",
    "the scenario first outlined by @xcite ( i.e.  deflection of the hh  270 jet by a dense molecular cloud ) and later modeled by @xcite gives a reasonable explanation on the origin of the hh  110 jet and offers a good qualitative fitting for a set of properties observed in the jet behaviour ( e.g.   the strong lack of symmetry , relative to the outflow axis , of the proper motions ) , but fail in reproducing in more detail the kinematics and some other properties through the outflow .",
    "in particular , as was already discussed by @xcite , the jet / cloud collision models of @xcite did not predict the deceleration of the full spatial velocity along the outflow that is derived from imaging , long - slit and ifs data .    a variability in the ejection outflow velocity ( i.e.  pulsed jet models ) and/or an anomalously strong interaction between the outflow and the inhomogeneous environment",
    "were then suggested as plausible alternatives giving rise to such kinematic behaviour .",
    "interestingly , new modeling that incorporates these mechanisms has been recently published . @xcite and @xcite performed more complex , two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets that propagate through a small - scale inhomogeneous environment ( e.g.  clumps with a size smaller than the jet beam ) .",
    "their simulations predict that the collisions between slow clumps overtaken by faster ones should produce shock structures slightly smaller than the jet beam and displaced from the jet axis , like what is observed at some locations along hh  110 .",
    "these simulations also predict a complex evolution of these shock structures .",
    "in particular , properties such as excitation and velocity profiles across the jet beam , are far more complex than expected from an unperturbed clump , or from the internal working surfaces arising from current models of a pulsed jet .",
    "further insights on the behaviour of deflected supersonic jets were recently obtained by @xcite from laboratory experiments .",
    "the experiments show how the morphology of the contact discontinuity between the jet and the obstacle develops a complex structure of cavities that gives rise to the entrainment of clumps of material from the obstacle into the flow .",
    "the experiments also succeeded in reproducing the morphology of some filaments such as those observed in high - spatial resolution ( hst ) images of hh  110 , although the observed dynamics in these filamentary structures were not properly reproduced by the experiments . according to the results of these laboratory experiments , as compared to their high - resolution , long - slit data , the authors proposed that the best model for hh  110 still is that of a pulsed ( from a varying driving source ) jet interacting with a dense molecular clump .",
    "the results derived from our ifs observations that can be compared with those found from these authors ( e.g.  the velocity behaviour through the flow and the line profiles at selected positions ) appear well consistent , thus giving further support to models that involve deflection of a pulsed jet propagating through an inhomogeneous ambient medium .",
    "the ifs data here presented give a full spatial coverage in the h@xmath2 , [ nii ]  and [ sii]emission lines of the singular outflow hh  110 . they have allowed us to explore for the first time the whole spatial distribution of the physical conditions and its relationship with the kinematics of the jet emission .",
    "we would like to point out that there are very few ifs observations of stellar jets with a wide spatial coverage of the outflow in several emission lines ( as e.g.  hh  34 by @xcite ) .",
    "such observations are highly necessary to understand the behaviour of the physical conditions as a function of the kinematics , as well as to explore whether this behaviour varies ( as in hh  34 ) or not ( as in hh  1 ) with the distance from the exciting source ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the paucity of available data prevents to establish a general picture on these topics .",
    "because of the rather chaotic behaviour of hh  110 outlined in previous works , as derived from more limited narrow - band imaging and long - slit spectroscopic data , the ifs observations discussed here are particularly useful for characterizing the properties of the whole outflow .",
    "hence , a more realistic picture has arisen , suitable for designing new state - of - the - art simulations to match the hh  110 scenario .",
    "note that ifs data give much more detailed information on the spatial distribution of excitation as a function of velocity than provided by current model simulations or laboratory jet experiments .",
    "these data could provide valuable clues to constrain the space parameters in future theoretical works , which are necessary to understand the origin , structure and dynamics of hh  110 .",

    "<S> the ifs data give richer information than that provided by current model simulations or laboratory jet experiments . </S>",
    "<S> hence , they could provide valuable clues to constrain the space parameters in future theoretical works .    </S>",
