    "radio sources constitute an unequally powerful tool to investigate the origin and evolution of our universe .",
    "in fact , radio emission is not obscured or attenuated by dust or gas , so deep radio surveys offer a unique opportunity to detect and study sources up to the highest redshifts .",
    "it is following this rationale that very ambitious programs like the planned square kilometer array ( ska , carilli et al . , 2004 )",
    "facility , a gigantic radio telescope with a total collective area of 1 square kilometer , or its precursors askap ( australian ska pathfinder , johnston s. et al .",
    "2007 ) and meerkat ( jonas j.l . 2009 ) will soon see their first light .",
    "when applied to radio sources , the expected advantages in sensitivity , field - of - view , frequency range and spectral resolution will yield terrific progress in many research fields , from cosmology to astrophysics .",
    "extra - galactic radio sources are however a mixed bag of astrophysical objects : amongst the most powerful ones we find radio - loud qsos and frii ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) galaxies while , moving to weaker sources , the dominant populations become fri , low - excitation galaxies and star - forming galaxies , whose contribution to the total radio counts become predominant at the sub - mjy level . discerning amongst these objects and",
    "their relative weight is an impossible task to carry out only on the basis of radio - continuum data .",
    "this is why increasingly more effort was recently put on photometric and spectroscopic follow - up studies of radio sources detected in deep - field surveys ( amongst the many : schinnerer et a. 2004 ; 2007 ; 2010 for the cosmos field ; morrison et al .",

    "2012 for the atlas field ) .",
    "investigations of the optical properties of radio sources can then disentangle the different populations and also allow to determine a number of quantities which influence the source behavior like e.g. the black - hole mass in optical spectra dominated by broad emission lines ( e.g. metcalf & magliocchetti 2006 ) .",
    "following the launch of the _ spitzer _ satellite , in the recent years radio sources have also been investigated at mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths",
    "( e.g. appleton et al . 2004 ; boyle et al . 2007 ; magliocchetti , andreani & zwaan 2008",

    "2009 ; de breuck et al . 2010",
    "; norris et al . 2011 amongst the many ) .",
    "these studies proved to be extremely useful for two main reasons : they allowed investigations of the properties and evolution of the sub - population of star - forming galaxies up to @xmath6 , while on the other hand they provided interesting hints on the central engine responsible for radio ( and mir ) agn emission .",
    "it is only in these very last few years that the radio community has started to realize the importance of multi - wavelength studies which also include far - infrared ( fir ) information .",
    "this growing interest is primarily due to the advent and launch of the _ herschel _ satellite , which for the first time has observed galaxies at fir wavelengths up to very large cosmological ( @xmath7 ) distances .",
    "earlier fir missions such as iras , iso and _",
    "spitzer_@70@xmath8 m only probed the * relatively local ( @xmath9 ) * universe , and since agn - powered radio galaxies in the local universe are almost ubiquitously hosted by massive red galaxies with little or no ongoing star - formation activity ( e.g. magliocchetti et al . 2002 ; 2004 ) , and since fir emission in galaxies is almost entirely due to processes connected with ongoing star formation , it follows that any pre-_herschel _ interest in a joint radio - fir analysis was limited to re - assess the precision of the tight radio - fir correlation found by early iras - based studies of local star - forming galaxies ( condon et al . 1982 ) .",
    "however , when moving to higher redshifts , galaxies undergo dramatic changes .",
    "for instance , it is now well assessed that both the cosmic star - forming activity and agn output steadily increase with look - back time at least up to redshifts @xmath10 ( e.g. gruppioni et al .",
    "2013 : merloni , rudnick & di matteo 2004 ) , and many galaxies are observed to host both an active agn and ongoing star - formation ( e.g. alexander et al .",
    "it is then legitimate to wonder whether radio galaxies also follow such a trend and if in the early universe they are also associated with ongoing stellar production .",

    "the relatively poor angular resolution of the _ herschel _ mirror at the two considered wavelengths ( respectively @xmath34 at 100@xmath8 m and @xmath35 at 160@xmath8 m ) introduces some issues regarding the choice of the optimal maximum radius to be adopted in the matching procedure .",
    "in fact , matching radii as large as the above angular resolutions would imply a very large fraction of mismatches ( i.e. spurious associations ) . on the other hand , a too small radius would cause a sensible loss of true associations .    in order to investigate the above issue , we have then considered the distribution of radio - to - infrared matches as a function of angular separation , both for 100@xmath8m- and for 160@xmath8m - selected sources .",

    "the above choice ensures a negligible contribution from spurious associations in our matched catalogues : 2.5% at 100@xmath8 m and 2.9% at 160@xmath8 m .",
    "most of the considered radio sources have detections at both 100@xmath8 m and 160@xmath8 m , so the above numbers are somewhat redundant .",
    "the final , total number of f@xmath38jy vla - cosmos sources with an infrared counterpart either at 100@xmath8 m or at 160@xmath8 m is 1219 , corresponding to 51% of the original sample . of these sources ,",

    "the above numbers are summarized in table  1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while the fraction of radio sources with a redshift determination presents a distribution which is independent of radio flux , the number of infrared counterparts to radio - selected sources dramatically decreases for increasing radio flux cuts .",
    "in fact , by considering radio sources respectively brighter than 0.1 mjy , 0.25 mjy , 0.5 mjy , and 1 mjy , we find that the percentages of true associations are 50% , 39% , 28% and 24% .",

    "in fact , figure [ fig : idsvss ] ( lower panel ) clearly shows that while the process of providing a redshift to a radio source is independent of its radio flux ( at least down to 60  @xmath8jy ) , the same can not be said for the chances of a radio source to also be a fir emitter . in this latter case",
    ", one has that the probability sharply drops from about 50% to @xmath4025% and lower for radio fluxes brighter than @xmath400.5 mjy .",
    "interestingly enough , we also find that the fraction of radio sources with associated fir emission is almost constant below the above flux threshold , while it tends to monotonically decrease with radio flux at brighter fluxes .",
    "this is probably not surprising .",

    "but when in absence of spectroscopic information , how can we distinguish between radio emission of agn origin and that instead due to star forming processes ? in the local universe , things are quite straightforward .",

    "however , at high redshifts , discerning between these two populations becomes more uncertain .",
    "the pioneering work of appleton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) uses the radio - to - mid - infrared ratio @xmath45 to single out radio emission from star - forming sources and separate it from that due to the the presence of an agn up to redshifts @xmath46 . a similarly tight correlation between far - ir and radio fluxes",
    "is also found in the most recent works based on _ herschel _ and _ spitzer _ data ( e.g. sargent et al .",

    "higher than @xmath46 though , all the works based on radio and infrared detections notice a larger spread and/or an evolution of the radio - to - ir ratios from the values which are locally measured note however the opposite finding of the mao et al .",
    "2011 work , although only based on 10 sources with @xmath47 ) .",
    "the explanation for this effect is rather simple : @xmath46 in fact marks the transition from a relatively quiet universe , to one dominated by agn and cosmic star - formation activities ( e.g. merloni , rudnik , di matteo 2004 ) . in such a universe",
    ", many star - forming galaxies are found to host an agn ( e.g. alexander et al .",
    "2008 ; del moro et al .",
    "2013 ) , so a clear distinction between these two classes of sources based on their radio - to - infrared colours is extremely difficult . at the same time , galaxies at @xmath6 are generally younger than those found in the local universe , so that also an optical search for radio galaxies as red - and - dead sources might prove to be ineffective . for the above reasons , we decided to use radio emission as the sole indicator of agn rather than star forming activity in the vla - cosmos sample .",
    "our approach is based on the results of mcalpine , jarvis & bonfield ( 2013 ) who used the optical and near infrared spectral energy distributions of a sample of 942 radio sources ( out of 1054 objects selected at 1.4 ghz , with a completeness level of 91% ) from the video - xmm3 field to distinguish between star forming and agn - powered galaxies and derive their redshifts .",
    "these authors provide luminosity functions for the two classes of sources up to redshifts @xmath48 and find different evolutionary behaviours , with star - forming objects evolving in a much stronger way ( @xmath49 than radio - selected agn ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we note that these results are in agreement with those of smolcic et al .",
    "( 2009 a , b ) obtained on the same cosmos - vla dataset we are using in this work .",
    "+ investigations of their results show that the radio power p@xmath51 beyond which agn - powered galaxies become the dominant radio population scales with redshift roughly as @xmath52 at least up to @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54[w hz sr@xmath12 ] is the value which is found in the local universe and which roughly coincides with the break in the radio luminosity function of star - forming galaxies ( cfr magliocchetti et al .",
    "2002 ; mauch & sadler 2007 ) . beyond this value ,",
    "their luminosity function steeply declines , and the contribution of star - forming galaxies to the total radio population is drastically reduced to a negligible percentage .",
    "the same trend is true at higher redshifts , and since the radio luminosity function of star - forming galaxies drops off in a much steeper way than that of agn at all @xmath56 , we expect the chances of contamination in the two samples to be quite low .",
    "radio powers for our sample of 1537 radio - selected sources endowed with a redshift estimate have been calculated according to the relation : @xmath57 where the result is in [ w hz sr@xmath12 ] units , d is the angular diameter distance and @xmath58 is the spectral index of the radio emission ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "since we do not have estimates for this latter quantity , we adopted the average value @xmath60 found for similar surveys ( e.g. randall et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) both for star - forming galaxies and for agn emission .",
    "such an assumption should not be too far from the truth as 1 ) radio sources in the cosmos - vla sample are faint , therefore the chances of finding a large number of bright , flat spectrum agn are rather thin and 2 ) recent results report values @xmath61 also for star - forming galaxies at @xmath62 ( ibar et al .",
    "2010 ) , similar to what found locally for the same population ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "we then distinguished between agn - powered galaxies and star - forming galaxies by means of equation ( [ eq : p ] ) for @xmath63 and by fixing @xmath64 [ w hz sr@xmath12 ] at higher redshifts ( cfr mcalpine , jarvis & bonfield 2013 ) .",
    "this procedure identifies 1026 sources ( corresponding to @xmath65% of the parent sample endowed with a redshift determination ) as star - forming galaxies and 482 as agn . note that , due to the adopted selection criteria and thanks to the great depth of the cosmos - vla survey , the agn sample is _ complete _ with respect to radio selection at all redshifts @xmath1 ( @xmath66 mjy corresponds to @xmath67 [ w hz sr@xmath12 ] at all @xmath68 ) , i.e. the considered sample of cosmos - vla sources endowed with a redshift determination includes _ all _ radio - emitting agn , except for a small handful of sources ( less than 10 , cfr figure 5 ) at the highest , @xmath69 , redshifts .",

    "again as expected , almost all star - forming galaxies ( indicated by the dashed line ) are associated to a fir counterpart , the percentage decrement towards low radio fluxes only being due to the fact that the radio survey probes deeper fluxes than the fir sampling .",

    "in fact , we find that the chances for an agn of fixed radio luminosity to be a fir emitter sensibly increase when moving from the lowest to the highest redshifts probed by our analysis .",

    "+ from the above analysis , we can then conclude that _ the probability for a radio - selected agn to be active in the fir is both a function of radio power and redshift , whereby powerful sources are more likely to emit at fir wavelengths at higher redshifts_.    the cosmos photometric catalogue also provides stellar mass estimates for the majority of the sources endowed with a redshift determination .",

    "the low - mass , @xmath88 , tail of the distribution is practically absent and the distribution itself is quite narrowly centered around @xmath89 .",
    "this is in agreement with results from the clustering of radio - active agn which show them to be hosted by very massive , @xmath90 dark matter halos ( e.g. magliocchetti et al .",
    "2004 : fine et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the distribution of masses of cosmos - vla agn with a pep counterpart ( presented in figure [ fig : idsvsmasstype ] by the dashed histogram ) is also quite interesting .",
    "first of all , the sub - population of fir emitters tends to be hosted by smaller galaxies .",
    "their distribution in fact peaks at @xmath91 , vs the @xmath89 value found for the whole population of radio - selected agn .",
    "furthermore , we find that about 50% of agn has a fir counterpart only in the very narrow @xmath92 \\rm m_\\odot$ ] range , while this percentage is drastically reduced to values below @xmath81% both at lower and higher masses . in other words , it seems that _ there is a preferential mass scale for which radio agn can also be active at fir wavelengths_.    as in the previous case , more information on the above finding can be gathered by splitting the agn sample into redshift bins and re - estimating the mass distribution as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig : idsvsmassztype ] , which clearly shows that fir emitters are preferentially found in smaller , @xmath93 , galaxies only for @xmath94 .",
    "there appears not to be any specific trend at higher redshifts , whereby the chances for a radio - selected agn to also be a fir emitter are independent of the mass of its host galaxy .",
    "in the previous section we have obtained two important results .",
    "the first one is that the probability for a radio - selected agn to also be a fir emitter is a strong function of both radio luminosity and redshift .",
    "such a probability in fact monotonically decreases for brighter sources , but the radio luminosity at which this effect starts appearing increases as we move to higher @xmath56 s .",
    "we have also found that , at all redshifts @xmath95 , there is a typical ( narrow ) galaxy mass range m@xmath96 \\rm m_\\odot$ ] which maximizes the chances for an agn to also emit at fir wavelengths .",
    "however , the above results do not shed any light on what is ( are ) the physical process(es ) responsible for fir emission in radio - active agn .    in order to answer this question ,",
    "we have then considered the photometrical properties of such sources .",
    "more precisely , we have analysed the distribution of infrared and radio fluxes and compared them with those exhibited by the sub - population of star - forming galaxies , selected from the cosmos - vla sample by applying the prescription given in  3 .",
    "figures [ fig : q100 ] and [ fig : q160 ] present the distribution of flux ratios @xmath97 and @xmath98 plotted as a function of look - back time for radio - selected sources of different radio luminosities .",
    "the left - hand panels show the case for agn , while the right - hand panels refer to star - forming galaxies ( a more exhaustive work on the evolution of the fir - to - radio relation based on pep data is presented in magnelli et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the dashed lines reproduce the q@xmath99 and q@xmath100 ratios obtained from the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of m82 , while the dotted ones are those expected for an arp220-like galaxy .",
    "as it is clearly visible , the distributions obtained for the two different populations are remarkably different : star - forming galaxies smoothly sit on the template curves that are appropriate for this population while , at all radio luminosities , the large majority of agns presents boosted radio activity which does not appear to be correlated with their fir emission .",
    "more information can be gathered from figures [ fig : q100 ] and [ fig : q160 ] which show some trend for the q@xmath99 and q@xmath100 values of agn of fixed radio luminosity to increase and approach those indicated by the template star - forming seds as we move up in redshifts .",
    "this is better seen in figure [ fig : qav ] which represents the residuals @xmath101q between the average values of q@xmath99 ( left - hand panel ) and q@xmath100 ( right - hand panel ) obtained for radio - selected agn and the corresponding arp220 sed as a function of redshift for different radio luminosities . at all radio luminosities and in both the q@xmath99 and q@xmath100 cases , the residuals decrease and tend to the zero value ( highlighted by the horizontal dotted lines ) as one moves back in time .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for @xmath102 [ w hz sr@xmath12 ] sources , mainly because this is the only case which covers the whole redshift range probed by our analysis and shows the best statistics , but it can still be appreciated , although to a lower significance level , at the other radio luminosities .",
    "note that , since the above analysis has been performed at fixed radio luminosities , this result implies that _ the observed trend is solely due to an enhancement of fir activity_. + as a comparison , we have also plotted the @xmath103 and @xmath104 residuals obtained for the sub - class of star - forming galaxies ( filled dots with associated errorbars ) at all radio luminosities .",
    "as expected , in this case the data does not show any dependency on either radio power or redshift and the photometric properties of these sources are perfectly compatible with an arp220 sed .",
    "another point from figure [ fig : qav ] which is important to stress is that the dependence observed at low redshifts between the quantities @xmath101q and radio luminosity ( brighter luminosities correspond to larger absolute values of @xmath101q ) tends to be reduced as one moves to earlier epochs . by complementing these findings with the results obtained in the previous section ,",
    "we can then conclude that _ the fractional increment of fir emitters amongst radio - selected agn with look - back time is due to enhanced fir activity of such sources at earlier epochs . _ furthermore , the gradual reduction with @xmath56 of the @xmath101q - to - radio luminosity correlation observed in the local universe hints to a cosmological evolution , with agn activity increasingly less effective at inhibiting fir emission at the earlier epochs .    the origin of fir emission in radio - selected agn can then be better understood by examining the distribution of their f@xmath105 colours and comparing them with those exhibited by the population of star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is done in figure [ fig : q100_160 ] , which presents such colours as a function of redshift , for different intervals of radio luminosity . once again",
    ", the dotted and dashed lines represent the fir colours of an m82-like galaxy and of an arp220-like galaxy .",
    "radio - selected agn present a distribution which is indistinguishable from that of star - forming galaxies .",
    "both populations tightly follow the trend indicated by the two template ( star - forming ) seds .",
    "even more interestingly , this happens at all radio luminosities , even for the most powerful , @xmath106 [ w hz sr@xmath12 ] sources , which do not show any deviation from the general trend .",
    "it is then straightforward to conclude that _ fir emission in radio - selected agn is due to processes connected with ongoing star - formation within the host galaxy . at fir levels , such processes are indistinguishable from those powering pure star - forming galaxies . _ and since star - forming processes also generate radio emission , another important conclusion of our analysis is that _ the observed radio signal produced by radio - selected agn which are also active at fir wavelengths is the superposition of two contributions , one due to agn accretion and one caused by stellar formation within the host galaxy .",
    "_          the above results surely hold for the @xmath4035% of the cosmos - vla sample of radio - selected agn which also have a fir counterpart from pep . what about the rest of the agn population ?",
    "are our conclusions still valid or do selection processes play an important biasing role ? in order to answer this question , first of all we recall that , for radio fluxes f@xmath107 mjy , the agn selection we performed based on equation ( [ eq : p ] ) ensures the sample is basically complete in radio selection at all available redshifts . and",
    "since the fraction of radio - selected agn which have a fir counterpart is roughly independent of both redshift and radio flux ( cfr figures 4 and 5 ) , we expect that probing fir fluxes that are fainter than those observed by the pep survey would merely have the effect of increasing the fraction of fir - detected radio agn , while leaving all the conclusions of this paper unchanged .",
    "+ one might also wonder whether the findings of this work could be affected by contamination of the agn sample with star - forming galaxies . to answer this concern",
    ", we first notice that , since the sample was selected only on the basis of radio emission and since the radio luminosity function of star - forming galaxies is much steeper than that of agn at all z , chances of contamination based on selection for radio luminosities above a chosen threshold are very limited .",
    "it is true that , since the two populations have been originally divided by mc alpine et al .",
    "( 2012 ) on the basis of their optical and near infrared seds , there might be cases in which an agn appearing in the optical / nir bands might not be active at radio wavelengths , so that the radio signal observed for that object has to be attributed to star - forming processes in the host galaxy rather than to accretion onto a black hole . these sources would result to follow the various q@xmath108 behaviours which are appropriate for star - forming galaxies , and in general show relatively low radio powers ( crf  3 )",
    ". however we do not expect many of these cases . and , most importantly , none of the conclusions of this work would change",
    "if we remove these sources , since the findings we derive for our agn sample are based on smooth trends throughout the whole range of radio powers .",
    "lastly , we also considered 24@xmath8 m fluxes and the distribution of mir - to - radio , f@xmath109/f@xmath110 , and mir - to - fir , f@xmath109/f@xmath111 , colours as a function of redshift .",
    "this is done in figure [ fig : q24 ] . as it was for the distribution of fir colours",
    ", we find that there is not much of a difference in the behavior of agn and star - forming galaxies .",
    "the agn distribution is more spread out and these objects still show some enhancement in their radio activity with respect to star - forming galaxies , especially at the highest radio luminosities , but the difference is much less noticeable than in the previous q@xmath108 distributions presented in figures [ fig : q100 ] and [ fig : q160 ] .",
    "we can then conclude that , even at mir levels , radio - selected agn and star - forming galaxies are roughly indistinguishable from each other .",
    "interestingly enough , both populations show a marked preference to follow the tracks highlighted by the arp220 sed .",
    "this implies that , independent of the origin of radio activity , their hosts are the sites of extremely intense ongoing star - formation processes , like it is the case for arp220-like galaxies .",
    "with the aim of investigating the far - infrared properties of radio - active agn , we have cross - matched the cosmos - vla catalogue of radio sources with fluxes f@xmath38jy with two datasets of galaxies observed at 100@xmath8 m and 160@xmath8 m by the _",
    "herschel_-pep survey .    in order to minimize biases due to selections at multiple wavelengths ,",
    "agn were extracted from the cosmos - vla sample only on the basis of their radio luminosity .",
    "this was done by following the recent results of mcalpine et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for the evolution of the radio luminosity function of star - forming galaxies and agn up to @xmath3 .    to achieve our goal ,",
    "we have then considered the 1537 radio sources ( 65% of the parent sample , independent of radio flux ) from the cosmos - vla survey which also had a reliable redshift estimate .",
    "thanks to the depth of the radio survey , our selection criteria ensure that the radio - active agn population is _ complete _ with respect to radio selection up to redshifts @xmath112 .    out of the 1537 objects from the cosmos - vla survey with a redshift estimate , 832",
    "were found to have a fir counterpart , either at 100@xmath8 m ( f@xmath113 mjy ) or at 160@xmath8 m ( f@xmath114 mjy ) .",
    "175 of these sources were classified as agn according to our selection criteria .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath72% of the parent , radio - selected , agn sample .",
    "the redshift distribution of radio - selected agn with a fir counterpart closely follows that of the parent agn population and shows two marked peaks at @xmath2 and @xmath3 . on the contrary , irrespective of their fir emission , the redshift distribution of radio - selected star - forming galaxies is found to monotonically decrease with look - back time .",
    "we find that the probability for a radio - selected agn to be detected at fir wavelengths is a strong function of radio luminosity , whereby more luminous sources have the lowest chances of also being fir emitters .",
    "however , as there is also a strong dependency on redshift , such chances are minimal for powerful radio sources in the local universe .",
    "for instance , a typical radio agn with p@xmath115 [ w hz sr@xmath12 ] has @xmath116% probability of being detected at fir wavelengths for @xmath117 , while this percentage rises to @xmath83% in the redshift range @xmath84 $ ] , and up to @xmath85% at the highest redshifts probed by our analysis .",
    "we have shown that this is due to a combination of two effects : the first one is the enhancement of fir activity with look - back time observed in radio - selected agn of all luminosities .",
    "this effect is further boosted by the fact that at earlier epochs radio activity is found to be less efficient at inhibiting the processes which are responsible for fir emission .    by analysing the mass distribution of radio - selected agn with or without a fir counterpart",
    ", we also found that fir emitters are associated to galaxies of statistically lower stellar masses .",
    "also , there seems to exist a quite narrow range of masses , m@xmath118 $ ] m@xmath119 , which maximizes the chances for fir emission to about 50% or more of the parent sample . beyond such range",
    ", the probability sharply drops to @xmath12020% .",
    "however , this is only valid for @xmath4 . at higher redshifts",
    ", we do not observe any preferential mass scale .    by comparing the observed fir , mir and radio colours with a range of available templates",
    ", we can conclude that fir activity in radio - selected agn is due to processes connected to star - forming activity within the host galaxy .",
    "such processes produce fir emission which is indistinguishable from that produced in `` pure '' star - forming galaxies . an important point",
    "to stress is that since star - forming processes also generate radio emission , the observed radio signal produced by radio - selected agn which are also active at fir wavelengths is generated by the superposition of two contributions , one due to agn accretion and one caused by stellar formation within the host galaxy .",
    "note that the above results refer to the @xmath72% of radio - selected agn with a fir counterpart in the pep survey .",
    "however , since the agn sample is basically complete in radio selection at all redshifts , and since the fraction of agn which have a fir counterpart is found to be roughly independent of both redshift and radio flux , we expect that probing fir fluxes that are fainter than those observed by the pep survey would merely have the effect of increasing the fraction of fir - detected sources , while leaving the general conclusions of this paper unchanged .",
    "we have also shown that our results are safe against possible contamination of the agn sample with star - forming galaxies .",
    "putting together the various pieces of information we have gathered so far then returns a very interesting picture on the cosmological evolution of the population of radio - active agn : at redshifts which coincide with the peak of cosmic star - formation , @xmath121 $ ] , many of these sources ( about 50% from our sample , but as previously discussed we expect more from deeper fir surveys ) are associated to strong fir emission due to intense star - forming activity within the host galaxy .",
    "these concomitant processes of star - formation and agn accretion take place in all galaxies with stellar masses m@xmath122 m@xmath119 without a preferential mass scale , and star - formation is only inhibited in the very few extremely powerful , p@xmath79 [ w hz sr@xmath12 ] , agn .",
    "this happens not only because cosmic star - formation is maximum at these epochs even in radio - selected agn , but also because the process is so intense that even important feedback of agn origin can not swipe off gas from the galaxy sites where star formation takes place .",
    "as we approach the more local universe , things change .",
    "fir activity in agn hosts decreases and even a small amount of agn feedback ( like that produced by a p@xmath80 [ w hz sr@xmath12 ] source ) , becomes increasingly more effective at switching off stellar production in the host galaxy .",
    "radio - active agn are progressively found associated to more and more `` red and dead '' galaxies of large masses .",
    "concomitant star - formation and agn activity only remain in a very small fraction ( @xmath12020% in our sample for @xmath9 ) of objects which are hosted by relatively small galaxies and whereby agn emission and its related feedback are increasingly weaker . interestingly enough , our results mirror those obtained for agn selected in the x - ray band ( page et al .",
    "this implies that the cosmic history of agn feedback is a general feature which does not depend on the waveband adopted to select black - hole powered sources .",
    "the above results put a warning to all those criteria which use mir and/or fir information to distinguish between agn - powered sources and star - forming galaxies .",
    "in fact , while these methods hold in the local , @xmath9 , universe , the concomitant presence of agn accretion and star formation in the majority of the sources selected at the radio wavelengths at higher redshifts implies that a clear distinction between these two populations based on their infrared properties might prove to be much harder than previously thought .",
