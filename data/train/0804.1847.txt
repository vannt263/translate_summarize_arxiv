    "the non - equilibrium dynamics of disordered systems gives rise to a lot of striking properties that have been much studied both theoretically and experimentally ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the first property that has attracted a lot of attention is aging which can be seen as some criticality in the time direction , in the following sense : if the dynamics has taken place during the time interval @xmath2 $ ] , the only relevant time scale for the dynamics at larger times @xmath3 is the time @xmath4 itself .",
    "a well known example is the case of phase ordering of finite - dimensional systems when the dynamics tends towards equilibrium presenting some long - ranged order .",
    "it is then useful to introduce some coherence length @xmath5 that separates the smaller lengths @xmath6 which are quasi - equilibrated from the bigger lengths @xmath7 which are completely out of equilibrium .",
    "then equilibrium is reached only when the coherence length reaches the macroscopic linear size @xmath8 of the system . in pure systems ,",
    "these phenomena of phase ordering are well understood @xcite and the coherence length grows algebraically @xmath9 with some dynamical exponent @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that for pure systems , domain growth is possible even at zero - temperature because domain walls can still move and annihilate . in the presence of quenched disorder however , the dynamics requires thermal activation ( in particular , at zero temperature , the dynamics stops on the first encountered local minimum ) . within the droplet scaling theory proposed both for spin - glasses @xcite and for directed polymers in random media @xcite , the barriers grow as a power law of the length @xmath11 @xmath12 with some barrier exponent @xmath13 .",

    "[ typltime ] which is asymptotically size and time independent as it should",
    ". however , since fits of numerical data in most disordered systems will probably remain controversial for a long time , we feel that more detailed theoretical arguments should be provided in favour of either algebraic or logarithmic behavior . in this paper",
    ", we explain why the strong disorder renormalization ( rg ) approach in configuration space introduced recently @xcite is an explicit construction in favor of the droplet logarithmic scaling of eq .",
    "[ typltime ] .    besides aging properties of disordered systems at a given temperature",
    ", physicists have been also interested into more complicated temperature cycling experiments that display rejuvenation and memory ( see @xcite and references therein for more details ) . the important point for the present discussion",
    "is that these phenomena require some hierarchical organization of valleys within valleys , where the rejuvenation due to short length scales does not destroy the memory of large length scales which are effectively frozen .",
    "since this hierarchy is sometimes believed to be present only in mean - field models , we would like to stress here that the droplet logarithmic scaling of eq .",
    "[ typltime ] effectively leads to a clear separation of time scales and to an effective hierarchy of valleys at large scales , as already argued in @xcite .",
    "the strong disorder rg procedure that we discuss in the present paper is in full agreement with these ideas , since we expect that for a very broad class of disordered systems in their glassy phase , the rg procedure flows towards some `` infinite disorder fixed point '' that precisely describes a strong hierarchy of valleys within valleys .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ rgconfig ] ,",
    "we recall the principles of strong disorder renormalization in configuration space introduced in @xcite and discuss its properties . in section [ numefull ] , we follow numerically the rg flow corresponding to the directed polymer in a two dimensional random medium and find evidence of convergence towards an `` infinite disorder '' fixed point . in section [ simplirg ] , we introduce simplified rg rules near `` infinite disorder '' fixed point . in section [ numesimpli ] , we present the numerical results based on simplified rg rules that allow to study bigger sizes and to estimate the barrier exponent @xmath1 of the fixed point . in section [ secpsi ]",
    ", we discuss the physical meaning of the barrier exponent @xmath1 for the structure of renormalized valleys in the configuration space .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "strong disorder renormalization ( see @xcite for a review ) is a very specific type of rg that has been first developed in the field of quantum spins : the rg rules of ma and dasgupta @xcite have been put on a firm ground by d.s .",
    "fisher who introduced the crucial idea of `` infinite disorder '' fixed point where the method becomes asymptotically exact , and who computed explicitly exact critical exponents and scaling functions for one - dimensional disordered quantum spin chains @xcite .",
    "this method has thus generated a lot of activity for various disordered quantum models @xcite , and has been then successfully applied to various classical disordered dynamical models , such as random walks in random media @xcite , reaction - diffusion in a random medium @xcite , coarsening dynamics of classical spin chains @xcite , trap models @xcite , random vibrational networks @xcite , absorbing state phase transitions @xcite , zero range processes @xcite and exclusion processes @xcite . in all these cases , the strong disorder rg rules have been formulated _ in real space _",
    ", with specific rules depending on the problem . for more complex systems where the formulation of strong disorder rg rules has not been possible in real space , we have recently proposed in @xcite a strong disorder rg procedure _ in configuration space _ that can be defined for any master equation . in the remaining of this section",
    ", we describe this procedure and discuss its properties in more details .      in statistical physics , it is convenient to define the dynamics via a master equation describing the evolution of the probability @xmath21 to be in a configuration @xmath22 at time t @xmath23 the notation @xmath24 represents the transition rate per unit time from configuration @xmath25 to @xmath22 , and the notation @xmath26 represents the total exit rate out of configuration @xmath22 .",
    "the two important properties of this master equation are the following :    \\(i ) the exit time @xmath27 from configuration @xmath22 is a random variable distributed with the law @xmath28 with the normalization @xmath29 .",
    "\\(ii ) the new configuration @xmath25 where the system jumps at time @xmath27 when it leaves the configuration @xmath22 is chosen with the probability @xmath30 normalized to @xmath31 .",
    "these two properties are the basis of faster - than - the - clock algorithms , called bortz - kalos - lebowitz algorithm @xcite in physics ( and gillespie algorithm @xcite in chemistry ) , where each iteration leads to a movement .",
    "however , even if these algorithms avoid trapping in a given microscopic configuration , they do not avoid trapping in a valley of configurations . as a consequence ,",
    "these algorithms which are usually very powerful for pure systems at low temperature become inefficient in the presence of frozen disorder because they face the futility problem @xcite : the number of distinct configurations visited during the simulation remains very small with respect to the accepted moves .",
    "the reason is that the system visits over and over again the same configurations within a given valley before it is able to escape towards another valley .",
    "this is why we propose in the following some renormalization procedure that allows to work directly with the valleys of configurations on larger and larger time scales .      for dynamical models ,",
    "the aim of any renormalization procedure is to integrate over fast processes to obtain effective properties of slow processes .",
    "the general idea of strong renormalization for dynamical models consists in eliminating iteratively the fastest process .",
    "the rg procedure introduced in @xcite can be summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) find the configuration @xmath32 with the biggest exit rate @xmath33 ( i.e. the smallest exit time , see eq .",
    "[ pexit ] ) @xmath34 \\label{defwmax}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    \\(2 ) find the neighbors @xmath35 of configuration @xmath32 , i.e. the configurations that were related via positive rates @xmath36 and @xmath37 to the decimated configuration @xmath32 ( here we will assume for the simplicity of the discussion , and because it is usually the case in statistical physics models , that if a transition has a strictly positive rate , the reverse transition has also a strictly positive rate ; but of course the renormalization rules can be simply extended to other cases ) .",
    "for each neighbor configuration @xmath38 with @xmath39 , update the transition rate to go to the configuration @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 according to @xmath43 where the first term represents the old transition rate ( possibly zero ) , and the second term represents the transition via the decimated configuration @xmath32 : the factor @xmath44 takes into account the transition rate to @xmath32 and the term @xmath45 represents the probability to make a transition towards @xmath40 when in @xmath32 ( see eq .",
    "[ pconfigjump ] ) .",
    "the @xmath46 rates @xmath47 and @xmath48 then disappear with the decimated configuration @xmath32 .",
    "note that the rule of eq .",
    "[ wijnew ] has been recently proposed in @xcite to eliminate fast states from various dynamical problems with two very separated time scales .",
    "the physical interpretation of this rule is as follows : the time spent in the decimated configuration @xmath32 is neglected with respects to the other time scales remaining in the system .",
    "the validity of this approximation within the present renormalization procedure will be discussed in detail below .",
    "\\(3 ) update the exit rates out of the neighbors @xmath38 , with @xmath49 either with the definition @xmath50 or with the rule that can be deduced from eq .",
    "[ wijnew ] @xmath51 ( since this rule contains a subtraction , it can be used numerically only with great care ! ) .",
    "the physical meaning of this rule is the following . the exit rate out of the configuration @xmath38 decays because the previous transition towards @xmath32 can lead to an immediate return towards @xmath38 with probability @xmath52 .",
    "after the decimation of the configuration @xmath32 , this process is not considered as an exit process anymore , but as a residence process in the configuration @xmath38 .",
    "this point is very important to understand the meaning of the renormalization procedure : the remaining configurations at a given renormalization scale are formally microscopic configurations of the initial master equation ( eq . [ master ] ) , but each of these remaining microscopic configuration actually represents some valley in configuration space that takes into account all the previously decimated configurations .",
    "\\(4 ) return to point ( 1 ) .",
    "note that in practice , the renormalized rates @xmath53 can rapidly become very small as a consequence of the multiplicative structure of the renormalization rule of eq [ wijnew ] .",
    "this means that the appropriate variables are the logarithms of the transition rates , that we will call barriers in the remaining of this paper .",
    "the barrier @xmath54 from @xmath22 to @xmath55 is defined by @xmath56 and similarly the exit barrier out of configuration @xmath22 is defined by @xmath57 note that a very important advantage of this formulation in terms of the renormalized transition rates of the master equation is that the renormalized barriers take into account the true barriers of the dynamics , whatever their origin which can be either energetic or entropic .      as mentioned above , the approximation made in the renormalization rule of eq .",
    "[ wijnew ] consists in neglecting the time spent in the decimated configuration @xmath32 with respect to the other time scales remaining in the system . in the present framework , this means that the maximal exit rate chosen in eq [ defwmax ] should be well separated from the exit rates of the neighboring configurations @xmath38 .",
    "the crucial idea of infinite disorder fixed point @xcite is that even if this approximation is not perfect during the first steps of the renormalization , this approximation will become better and better at large time scale if the probability distribution of the remaining exit rates becomes broader and broader upon iteration .",
    "more precisely , if the renormalization scale @xmath58 is defined as the exit barrier of the last eliminated configuration @xmath59 @xmath60 one expects that the probability distribution of the remaining exit barrier @xmath61 will converge towards some scaling form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fixed point probability distribution , and where @xmath64 is the appropriate scaling factor for the width .",
    "the notion of infinite disorder fixed point means that the width @xmath64 grows indefinitely with the renormalization scale @xmath58 @xmath65 whenever this infinite disorder fixed point condition is satisfied , the strong disorder renormalization procedure becomes asymptotically exact at large scales . in previously known cases of infinite disorder fixed points where calculations can be done explicitly @xcite , the scale @xmath64 has been found to grow linearly @xmath66 this behavior means that the cut - off @xmath58 is the only characteristic scale and thus describes some critical point @xcite . for the present procedure concerning the dynamics in disordered models ,",
    "this property means some criticality in the time direction , i.e. the absence of any characteristic time scale between the microscopic scale and the macroscopic equilibrium time of the full disordered sample .",
    "as explained at the beginning of the introduction , this criticality in the time direction will naturally leads to aging behaviors for two - time properties .",
    "an example where asymptotically exact two - time aging properties have been explicitly computed via strong disorder rg is the sinai model @xcite .",
    "when the width @xmath64 instead converges towards a finite value @xmath67 , one speaks of a ` finite - disorder fixed point ' .",
    "however , if this constant @xmath68 is large , one speaks of a strong disorder fixed point , and the validity of the rg approach is of order @xmath69 : we refer to @xcite where systematic expansions in @xmath69 with respect to the leading strong disorder rg have been explicitly computed .",
    "this notion of strong disorder fixed point is very useful to study the vicinity of infinite disorder fixed point in the space of parameters @xcite .",
    "for instance in the sinai model , the infinite disorder fixed point is realized in the absence of drift where the diffusion is logarithmically slow , whereas the strong disorder fixed point corresponds to the presence of a small drift where the diffusion is algebraic but with an anomalous exponent @xcite .",
    "for the present strong disorder renormalization of a master equation , the convergence towards an infinite disorder fixed point will depend on the initial condition of the transition rates , i.e. on the model ( and on the temperature if there are phase transitions ) . however , the form of the rg rules of eq [ wijnew ] is sufficiently similar to the usual ma - dasgupta rules @xcite to think that the convergence towards some infinite disorder fixed point should be realized in a very broad class of disordered systems in their glassy phase . in practice",
    ", it should be checked numerically for each model of interest .",
    "in dimension @xmath70 , strong disorder rg rules maintain the one - dimensional structure where each site has two neighbors , one on the left and one on the right , and this is why one can obtain explicit exact solutions @xcite .",
    "in dimension @xmath71 , strong disorder rg rules change the local coordination numbers and usually lead to a proliferation of neighbors as already found in real - space strong disorder rg studies of quantum models @xcite . with the present notations ,",
    "the reason is clear from the rg rule of eq .",
    "[ wijnew ] : if the decimated configuration @xmath32 has @xmath72 neighbors @xmath35 , one eliminates @xmath73 rates ( the rates @xmath47 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 ) but one can create up to @xmath76 transition rates ( the rates @xmath77 with @xmath75 and @xmath78 ) . the increase in the total number @xmath79 of transitions rates when one decimates a configuration @xmath32 with @xmath72 neighbors is thus only bounded by @xmath80 in particular , each of the @xmath72 neighbors @xmath38 looses one neighbor ( @xmath81 ) , but can gain up to @xmath82 new neighbors , so that the increase of its coordination number @xmath10 is only bounded by @xmath83 for an initial master equation describing local single moves , the first applications of the strong disorder rg procedure will establish new links between configurations that were not initially related via single moves . as a consequence , the number @xmath79 of rates and the coordination @xmath10 of the surviving configurations will increase during the first stages of the renormalization to describe moves made of two , three , .. elementary moves .    in real - space strong disorder rg studies of quantum models with couplings",

    "<S> to describe the non - equilibrium dynamics of random systems , we have recently introduced ( c. monthus and t. garel , arxiv:0802.2502 ) a strong disorder renormalization ( rg ) procedure in configuration space that can be defined for any master equation . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze in details the properties of the large time dynamics whenever the rg flow is towards some `` infinite disorder '' fixed point , where the width of the renormalized barriers distribution grows indefinitely upon iteration . in particular , we show how the strong disorder rg rules can be then simplified while keeping their asymptotic exactness , because the preferred exit channel out of a given renormalized valley typically dominates asymptotically over the other exit channels . </S>",
    "<S> we explain why the present approach is an explicit construction in favor of the droplet scaling picture where the dynamics is governed by the logarithmic growth of the coherence length @xmath0 , and where the statistics of barriers corresponds to a very strong hierarchy of valleys within valleys . as an example of application , </S>",
    "<S> we have followed numerically the rg flow for the case of a directed polymer in a two - dimensional random medium . </S>",
    "<S> the full rg rules are used to check that the rg flow is towards some infinite disorder fixed point , whereas the simplified rg rules allow to study bigger sizes and to estimate the barrier exponent @xmath1 of the fixed point .    </S>",
