    "this note is an attempt to provide novel answers to the question what should actually be played in games in which the players have incomplete preferences for the payoffs , i.e. there are non - comparable alternatives .",
    "our findings indicate that previously defined extensions of nash equilibria to the case of vector - valued payoffs or utility functions are not the only natural path to follow as done in @xcite : ` there is a natural way of extending the standard notion of nash equilibrium ' to incomplete preferences .",
    "in particular , we will discuss that there might be other ` incentives to deviate from her own action given every one else s action ' ( @xcite ) than just ( strictly ) improving the multi - dimensional payoff / utility with respect to the underlying vector order or ( non - complete ) preference .",
    "incomplete preferences and their representation came more into focus of the economic literature in the past two decades . aumann @xcite ( in search for a utility representation theory without the completeness axiom as the ` most questionable ' ) and bewley @xcite ( in search for a model that would make precise the difference between risk and uncertainty ) raised the issue .",
    "compare ok et al @xcite for a synthesis of these approaches .",
    "representation results for incomplete preferences via families of utility functions were given by ok @xcite , dubra et al @xcite , evren , ok @xcite , bosi , herden @xcite along with the perspective that vector optimization might be useful for solving the resulting multi - utility maximization problems : ` moreover , as it reduces finding the maximal elements in a given subset of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath2 to a multi - objective optimization problem ( cf .",
    "evren and ok , 2011 ) , in applications , this approach is likely to be more useful than the richter - peleg approach . '",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , up to now there is no ( expected ) multi - utility maximization theory with results comparable to the scalar case .",
    "rather , even in recent applications , a real - valued multi - attribute utility function is assumed to model the preference of a decision maker even in the highly complex framework of financial markets with frictions ( cf .",
    "campi , owen @xcite ) .",
    "a major motivation for investigating incomplete preferences stems from social choice theory .",
    "the reader may compare eliaz and ok @xcite ( and the references therein ) where the difference between indifference and indecisiveness is discussed as well as the weak axiom of revealed preferences ( warp ) which almost forces a complete preference .",
    "it is shown that a weakened version of warp is perfectly compatible with incomplete preferences , and the methodology given in this paper admits to distinguish between cases in which the decision maker is indifferent and cases in which ( s)he is indecisive .    the theory proposed here gives a different perspective to the very same phenomena .",
    "it is shown that players may deviate from an equilibrium by  free will , \" i.e. they may want to move to another equilibrium which produces a payoff which is not comparable to the first for reasons which are not part of the mathematical model",
    ". seen in this way , the interpretation is very close to a literal understanding of the word  incomplete \" as , for example , discussed in carlier , dana @xcite .",
    "our novel contribution can be summarized as follows :  set relations \" ( extensions of the vector order for the payoffs to the power set of possible payoffs ) are used for giving the players a guidance through the jungle of the many ( non - comparable ) equilibrium values with respect to the vector order , and , for the first time , well - motivated worst case estimates are provided which correspond to the von neumann minimax and maximin strategies in the one - dimensional payoff case .",
    "we use one of the easiest problems involving incomplete preferences as a show case for the set relation approach to game theory , namely a two - player , zero - sum matrix game where the utility function for each player just is , admitting mixed strategies , her / his expected vector - valued gain .",
    "already shapley @xcite ( see also aumann @xcite ) gave a motivation for studying games with multi - dimensional payoffs : ` the payoff of a game sometimes most naturally takes the form of a vector having numerical components that represent commodities ( such as men , ships , money , etc . )",
    "whose relative values can not be ascertained .",
    "the utility spaces of the players can therefore be given only a partial ordering ( representable as the intersection of a finite number of total orderings ) , and the usual notions of solution must be generalized . ' however , the theory even for  simple \" zero - sum matrix games with multi - dimensional payoffs is far from being complete in a way which parallels the elegant von neumann approach in the scalar case .",
    "the earliest proposal by blackwell @xcite generalized the notion of the value of a game to an  approachable set \" apparently motivated by the fact that , in contrast to the classic von neumann situation , insisting on a single payoff ( vector ) as value of the game does not make much sense for games with vector payoffs .",
    "shapley @xcite introduced an equilibrium notion which relies on the order generated by the positive cone in the images space .",
    "his concept indeed admitted to ` utilize the theory of vector optimization ( multi - objective programming ) ' ( cf .",
    "ok @xcite ) , and it was put into the context of vector optimization as vector equilibrium points or vector saddle points , see nieuwenhuis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.1 ) , corley ( * ? ? ? * ( 5 ) ) , luc and vargas @xcite , tanaka @xcite as well as many others .",
    "compare the survey tanaka @xcite and the references therein as well as zhao @xcite where general multi - objective games are considered and more references can be found .",
    "however , it turned out that , despite this effort , vector optimization did not yet provide a satisfying equilibrium theory , not even for two - player , zero - sum matrix games with vector - valued payoffs / utilities .    what are the reasons for the lack of an appealing and applicable , multi - dimensional equilibrium theory under incomplete preferences ?",
    "one difficulty is the sheer number of  shapley equilibrium values .",
    "\" shapley s main result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem ) reduces a zero - sum matrix game with vector payoffs to infinitely many scalar non - zero - sum games . in most cases",
    ", this produces just too many candidates for a solution and ` the impossible task of solving all possible scalarizations ' as remarked by corley ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) . in a more general context , bade @xcite observed the same : ` since nash equilibrium sets of games with incomplete preferences can be large , it is of interest to consider refinements of equilibria @xmath3 ' we refer to de marco , morgan @xcite for a discussion of several approaches and references .",
    "the idea is to impose additional requirements to the equilibrium @xcite ` which adds to the original problem new endogenous parameters that are typical for the vector - valued form . '",
    "however , the questions then asked are almost exclusively the one for the existence of such refined equilibria and the one for stability with respect to some class of perturbations . in the context of vector optimization",
    ", similar scalarization results can be found , for example , in zeleny @xcite ( basically , already shapley s result ) , cook @xcite ( minimizing the weighted underachievement of goals ) and wierzbicki @xcite ( via nonlinear scalarization functions ) .",
    "zhao s notion of nash equilibria ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 12 ) is based on properly efficient points which can also be found via linear scalarizations .",
    "another , even more important difficulty is that shapley equilibria are missing two main features of equilibrium strategies for scalar games .",
    "they are not interchangeable , and they do not provide worst case estimates .",
    "the missing interchangeability was observed by corley ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 3.2 ) ( see example [ excorley3.2 ] below ) , and contradicts aumann s belief that ` the interchangeability property holds ' ( cf .",
    "aumann @xcite ) for shapley equilibrium strategies .",
    "therefore , a  best possible answer \" to an equilibrium strategy is not necessarily a ",
    "best possible answer \" to another which leaves the question completely open what kind of strategy protects a player best against the opponent s choices .",
    "below , the meaning of  best \" will be scrutinized , and it will be given a new meaning via a set relation approach .",
    "the missing worst case insurance motivated ( sightly deviating from each other ) concepts of vector minimax and maximin strategies as discussed , for example , by nieuwenhuis @xcite , corley @xcite and tanaka @xcite .",
    "the relationship to the previously introduced vector equilibrium / saddle points remained obscure as observed by corley ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) : ` second , it is not clear how minimax and maximin points are related to equilibrium points , except that a joint minimax and maximin point is obviously an equilibrium point . '",
    "moreover , the interpretation as a worst case insurance failed as remarked by nieuwenhuis @xcite : ` whereas the notions of minimax point and maximin point do not seem to have an easy game - theoretic interpretation , the notion of saddle point has . '",
    "an attempt to resolve this issue by  brutal force \" was given by ghose and prasad @xcite , called pareto optimal security strategies ( poss ) .",
    "it relies on the idea of providing insurance against the component - wise worst cases , see ghose @xcite , fernandez , puerto @xcite , fernandez et al @xcite for more details , and leads to very conservative strategies which make little sense in many cases ( see section [ sec : rel ] below ) .",
    "the third major difficulty is more mathematical in nature .",
    "it boils down to the fact that the infimum and the supremum with respect to vector orders ( or even more general preferences ) are of no use in most cases .",
    "either they do not exist since the ( vector ) order is not a lattice order , or even if they do , they produce  ideal points \" which in many cases are not attainable payoffs .",
    "the two difficulties described above of generalizing the von neumann minimax theory to non - complete orders can be attributed to this feature .",
    "our approach via set relations opens a way out of this dilemma and is strictly motivated by the interpretation of the payoff as multi - dimensional loss for one and gain for the other player .",
    "we introduce a new solution concept for two - player , zero - sum matrix game where main tools are taken from the recently developed theory of set optimization @xcite , but different  set orders \" as , for instance , in @xcite are used .",
    "examples illustrate relationships to previous solution concepts and provide evidence that optimal strategies as introduced below indeed should be played if the players wish to achieve ",
    "best \" protection against losses , and it is easily seen that they enjoy the interchangeability property . by combining the new concept with shapley s equilibrium notions , new equilibrium concepts are obtained for which existence theorems are given .",
    "finally , an algorithm for computing such strategies is presented and discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the new solution concept is introduced , and existence theorems for corresponding equilibrium notions are provided . in section [ sec : rel ] the new concept is compared with others from the literature .",
    "section [ sec : alg ] is devoted to an algorithm for computing optimal strategies , and in section [ sec : num ] some numerical results are reported .",
    "the appendix contains a few crucial concepts from set optimization and also introduces some notation which is used in the paper .",
    "we recommend to browse it first in particular to readers who are not familiar with set relations .",
    "let @xmath4 be an integer and @xmath5 be an element of the @xmath6-dimensional vector space of column vectors with real components .",
    "we write @xmath7 where the upper @xmath8 indicates the transpose of the row vector .",
    "let @xmath9 be an @xmath10 matrix whose entries @xmath11 are @xmath6-dimensional column vectors of real numbers .",
    "we interpret @xmath12 as a loss matrix for the row - choosing player i. independently , player i and the column - choosing player ii select a row @xmath13 and a column @xmath14 , respectively , which results in player i delivering @xmath15 to player ii with the usual convention that negative delivery is something that i receives from ii . a possible interpretation of the payoff vectors @xmath15 is , of course , that the @xmath6 components of @xmath15 denote units of @xmath6 different assets , so i hands ii a portfolio instead of an amount of one particular currency .    as usual in the theory of finite matrix games",
    ", we consider mixed strategies .",
    "player i chooses row @xmath16 with probability @xmath17 and player ii column @xmath18 with probability @xmath19 . the two sets @xmath20 model the admissible ( mixed ) strategies of the two players . if player i chooses strategy @xmath21 and player ii @xmath22 , then the expected ( vector ) loss of player i is @xmath23 the set @xmath24 is in fact a ( possibly non - convex ) subset of the convex hull of the entries of the matrix @xmath12 .",
    "different from the scalar case , it is not a priori clear what kind of order should be used for comparing the ( expected ) payoffs",
    ". it would be reasonable to assume that each player has a preference for the payoffs and that these preferences are different from each other  as in bade @xcite , but in contrast to references like nieuwenhuis @xcite , tanaka @xcite where a general partial order in @xmath0 is used which is the same for both players .",
    "the point of view in this note is that it is only known to the players that player i prefersless loss \" and player ii prefersmore gain . \"",
    "therefore , it is assumed that both players decisions are consistent with the partial order @xmath25 generated by the closed convex cone @xmath26 , i.e. for @xmath27 the symbol @xmath28 means @xmath29 , and that no other information about the preferences of the players is available .",
    "shapley s assumption \" @xcite : ` it is also assumed that the first player wants to increase the components of the vector , and the second player wants to decrease them . finally , it is assumed that neither player has an a priori opinion concerning the relative importance to himself of the different components . '",
    "let player i choose a strategy @xmath30 .",
    "if for another strategy @xmath31 it holds @xmath32 then clearly @xmath33 is better than @xmath34 for player i. in this case , we write @xmath35 . in case of @xmath36 the strategies @xmath37 are considered to be equivalent and we write @xmath38 .",
    "it is natural to determine minimal elements with respect to the order @xmath39 and the equivalence relation @xmath40 .",
    "we say @xmath21 is _ @xmath39-minimal _ if @xmath41 likewise , we introduce @xmath42 , @xmath43 and _ @xmath42-maximality _ for player ii .",
    "it turns out , however , that the orders @xmath39 and @xmath42 are not  rich enough \" there are just too many @xmath39-minimal and @xmath42-maximal elements since many can not be compared with each other .

    "indeed , choosing @xmath46 we have @xmath47 i.e. , the larger @xmath48 $ ] the smaller with respect to @xmath49 is @xmath50 . on the other hand , taking @xmath51 we get @xmath52 i.e. the larger @xmath48 $ ] the larger with respect to @xmath49 is @xmath53 .",
    "this proves that any two strategies @xmath45 are not comparable and hence all @xmath21 are @xmath39-minimal .",
    "on the other hand , consider the strategy @xmath54 for player i. then @xmath55 for any two different elements @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 .",
    "thus , elements in @xmath56 are never comparable with respect to @xmath42 , which shows that all elements @xmath22 are @xmath42-maximal .",
    "even though , based on the order relations @xmath39 and @xmath42 , any strategy @xmath30 is optimal for player i and any @xmath58 is optimal for player ii , a look at the payoff matrix may convince the reader that it might be better for player i to favor the second row and better for ii to have a bias towards the second column .",
    "the above example provokes the question which order relation should be used instead .",
    "a minimal requirement certainly is that the order for player i maintains the @xmath39-order , but strategies should be comparable more often . if player i picks strategy @xmath21 , then her / his expected payoff belongs to the bounded convex polyhedron @xmath59 for given two strategies @xmath45 , the main idea is to compare the sets @xmath60 and @xmath61 by an appropriate set relation .",
    "for some introductory remarks on set relations , the reader is referred to the appendix .",

    "if player ii knows the strategy @xmath70 of player i , then ( s)he certainly will pick such a maximal (= non - dominated ) strategy .",

    "thus , the relation @xmath83 produces never more , but often fewer minimal elements : in example [ ex:04 ] , all strategies @xmath21 are minimal with respect to the order @xmath39 , but not all are for @xmath83 ( likewise for player ii ) as is explained in example [ ex:04a ] below .",
    "the above discussion almost forces the following set optimization approach to zero - sum matrix games with vector payoff .",

    "a strategy @xmath33 clearly is preferable over @xmath34 for player i if @xmath89 , i.e. one can reach the losses in @xmath90 from those in @xmath88 by gifting  which usually does not happen .",

    "this has to be done only once .",
