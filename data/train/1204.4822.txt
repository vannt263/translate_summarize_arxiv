    "entropy production is a measure of the irreversibility of a thermodynamic process : the difficulty , even impossibility of reversing the observed , often macroscopic behaviour of a system that exchanges heat or matter with a complex environment .",
    "the apparent breakage of time reversal symmetry associated with thermodynamic irreversibility has attracted discussion for more than a century .",
    "it was given a particular focus by loschmidt s views on boltzmann s work in gas dynamics @xcite but the issue was apparent far earlier in the contrast between fourier s law of heat flow and newton s laws in mechanics .",
    "but in spite of such concerns , the concept of entropy generation in the thermodynamics of large systems has been developed and applied widely , to the extent that equations for macroscopic entropy generation and transport associated with nonequilibrium hydrodynamic and thermal flows are available , for example see @xcite .    however , a microscopic understanding of the nature of entropy and its production has proved elusive , particularly with regard to understanding the one - way character of the second law . but",
    "some considerable steps forward have been made by modelling the microscopic evolution of a system and its environment using a framework of stochastic dynamics @xcite and stochastic thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "such an approach explicitly breaks time reversal symmetry through the use of a simplified model of the interactions between system and environment , a consequence of coarse - graining , such that a second law can emerge naturally . nevertheless , it is imperative to define entropy in this framework in such a way that makes contact with results known to hold macroscopically .",
    "entropy is often interpreted as a measure of uncertainty at the microscopic level , and the viewpoint offered by stochastic thermodynamics is that its overall production is a reflection , according to some views verging on the tautological @xcite , of the uncertain or stochastic dynamics that drive the evolution , though other interpretations based on deterministic dynamics exist as well @xcite .",
    "the stochastic approach suggests that a change in thermodynamic entropy , satisfying the second law , is an expectation value , or more simply the mean , of the change in a microscopic , path - dependent entropy that evolves stochastically in line with the dynamical model of the evolution of the system @xcite .",
    "this view allows us to consider entropy as an instantaneous microscopic property of a system and its environment , based on assignments of probabilities to each of the available microstates , but with the potential to increase or decrease during the process in question .",
    "this confers meaning to the entropy change that follows from a single realisation of a process , and avoids associating entropy production only with some sort of average over many realisations .",
    "it is only after such an averaging procedure that the total entropy is expected to increase .",
    "thus realisations that reduce entropy are quite possible : the second law within this framework quite clearly holds only in a statistical sense .    in detail , the entropy change associated with a specific evolution of a system , referred to as a trajectory or path , is defined in stochastic thermodynamics in terms of the probability that the path might be realised under the prevailing ` forward ' dynamics , driven by a forward protocol of time dependence , and the probability of realisation of a path that represents the reversal of the first , under the same dynamical rules but driven by a reversed protocol @xcite .",
    "this definition strongly associates the concept of entropy change with that of dynamical irreversibility .",
    "when the system state is described in a full phase space of spatial and velocity variables , or indeed any set that includes variables that change sign under time reversal , the reversed path clearly corresponds to a set of points in phase space that retraces the sequence of spatial positions , but with velocity coordinates that are inverted .",
    "it should be noted that the sequence where the velocities are not reversed is sometimes inaccessible under the given dynamics .",
    "the probability of the starting configuration for the reversed path is specified to be that which is generated from the forward process .",
    "such a specification produces a path - dependent entropy change that satisfies a number of requirements ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "these issues have recently been explored in the context of a master equation describing the evolution of system probabilities over a discrete full phase space @xcite , and for the stochastic dynamics of continuous coordinates that transform differently under time reversal @xcite .",
    "it has been established that the total path - dependent entropy change for such cases may be divided into three components , only two of which , together with the sum of the three , are expected to be non - negative on average . in this paper we analyse a number of examples involving a discrete full phase space , in order to provide a greater appreciation of this division of entropy production , and to reflect on the meaning of entropy production when the dynamics of a system and its environment are considered at various levels of detail under coarse - graining . we begin with a summary of the division of path - dependent entropy production into its components , before discussing particle drift and diffusion , flow brought about by injection and removal , and the transport of heat brought about through interaction of the particle with a temperature gradient .",
    "we end with some conclusions and remarks on how entropy production , defined within a framework of stochastic thermodynamics , in essence quantifies the failure of loschmidt s expectation of time reversal symmetry and dynamical reversibility for a given set of circumstances .",
    "consider a particle that can occupy one of @xmath0 discrete spatial positions @xmath1 in one dimension , and assume one of @xmath2 discrete values of velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the particle can make stochastic transitions between phase space points @xmath4 .",
    "we define the forward dynamics in terms of a transition rate @xmath5 characterising a move from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , such that the probabilities of occupation of the phase space points @xmath8 evolve according to the markovian master equation @xmath9 where the notation @xmath10 represents the total rate of transitions from point @xmath6 : @xmath11 these dynamical rules can be employed to generate stochastic paths of a particle across the discrete phase space .",
    "master equation treatments of dynamics in a discrete phase space of velocities as well as positions have a long history @xcite .",
    "stochastic entropy production is associated with the probabilities of dynamically generating a path and its reverse , and in a phase space with coordinates that change sign under time reversal , such as a velocity , the reversal of a path naturally requires an inversion of those coordinates .",

    "a heat current with associated entropy production can not be established in a phase space of one spatial dimension with reflective boundaries and so dynamics on a phase space of spatial points can not capture the irreversibility of heat conduction .",
    "this is the clearest of our demonstrations that a failure to take account of dynamics in full phase space can lead to the neglect of an important mechanism of entropy production and alter the apparent irreversibility of the process in question .",
    "we have investigated several simple examples where entropy production can be associated with specific , stochastically generated paths taken by a particle on a discrete full phase space .",

    "@xmath54 is also associated with the breakage of detailed balance but only exists for dynamics that include coordinates that change sign ( are ` odd ' ) under time reversal @xcite .",
    "a further condition for its existence is that the probability distribution for the stationary state under the prevailing conditions has to be asymmetric in an odd coordinate .",
    "the mean of @xmath54 is zero in a stationary state and so , like @xmath36 , it is associated with relaxation .",
    "thus @xmath54 has its origin in the dissipative mechanisms that are separately responsible for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the three components can be related to the changes in system and medium entropy @xcite as well as , in some circumstances , adiabatic and nonadiabatic entropy production @xcite .",
    "specifically , we have considered stochastic particle dynamics on discrete full phase spaces with transition rules that capture aspects of drift and diffusion , barrier crossing , injection , removal and interaction with a thermal gradient .",
    "the examples are necessarily simplified , but they illustrate the properties of the various components of entropy production summarised in the last paragraph , and furthermore demonstrate that the distributions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 satisfy integral fluctuation relations . they also show that the inclusion of additional detail in the specification of a system , or its opposite , coarse - graining , can have an impact on the assessment of entropy production .",
    "this is compatible with the notion that entropy is a representation of the uncertainty in microscopic state , and that its production is linked to the dynamics employed when modelling the evolution . by taking into account greater levels of detail in a dynamical system ,",
    "we potentially alter our perception of the uncertainty in the microscopic state , and the pattern of entropy production could be modified as a result . at the deepest level , of course , when we neglect no detail of either system or environment , there will be no stochasticity in the model ( we would then employ the ` real ' dynamics ) and no consequent development of uncertainty , and from a point of view of stochastic thermodynamics there would be no production of entropy .",
    "entropy change in this perspective is subjective , and depends on choices made in the modelling .",
    "we emphasise that these conclusions are based on an interpretation of entropy change and the second law acquired in the context of stochastic thermodynamics .",
    "the underlying dynamics have been taken to be stochastic and to break time reversal symmetry .",
    "entropy change is then associated with dynamical irreversibility expressed in terms of path probabilities .",
    "an interpretation based on deterministic and time - reversible dynamics is also available , whereby entropy generation is associated with the contraction of a continuous phase space and it is possible to derive fluctuation relations and a second law @xcite .    in closing , and from a perspective of stochastic thermodynamics , we reflect briefly on the nature of entropy and its production .",
    "time reversal invariance and determinism imply that events in the future as well as the past will be apparent to a being capable of perceiving the current state of the universe in all its detail , a point made by laplace .",
    "loschmidt used the same reasoning to identify the flaw in boltzmann s initial attempts to build a mechanical model of entropy production in an isolated ideal gas : the model could not provide the arrow of time .",
    "but loschmidt is far from being the villain of this piece of the history of science @xcite .",
    "consideration of time reversal enriches the meaning of entropy production in models that explicitly break this symmetry , in many cases through a representation of the interactions between a system and its environment that reflects a state of perception inferior to that of laplace s being .",
    "symmetry of equations of motion under time reversal is either present or it is not , but the practical consequence of its absence emerges on a broader spectrum , and in stochastic thermodynamics , entropy production is its measure . some trajectories generated by a stochastic model are hard to reverse ( meaning the reverse trajectory is relatively unlikely ) ; some are easier .",
    "the second law in stochastic thermodynamics is a statement about the statistical dominance of the hard cases .",
