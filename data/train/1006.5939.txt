    ", we will analyze the higgs couplings to massless vector bosons in rs models where all sm fields are in the bulk , and the modification to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings arises from integrating out kaluza - klein ( kk ) partners of the sm fields .",
    "previous works on this topic for rs models have been done in @xcite .",
    "these effects were also studied in models of warped extra dimensions in which the higgs arises as pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) @xcite and within the effective theory formalism @xcite .",
    "the studies of the higgs production in flat extra dimensions in the models with gauge higgs unification were carried out in @xcite .",
    "we will stick to the models with flavor anarchy @xcite in which the hierarchies in masses and mixings in the the fermion sector are explained by small overlap integrals between fermion wave functions and the higgs wave function along the extra dimension .",
    "previous studies of this framework have mainly focused on bounds on the kk scale coming from new flavor violating sources . in spite of the rs - gim mechanism , it was still found that @xmath2 processes mediated by the kk gluon push the mass of the kk excitations to be above @xmath3 tev @xcite , making them very hard to produce and observe at the lhc @xcite .",
    "these bounds coming from flavor violation in low energy observables can be relaxed by introducing additional flavor symmetries @xcite , or by promoting the higgs to be a 5d bulk field ( instead of being brane localized ) @xcite .",
    "a similar tension was found in the lepton sector in @xcite , making scale of @xmath4 tev still compatible with experiments .",
    "lower kk scales can be achieved by changing the fermion representations @xcite or by introducing flavor symmetries @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to point out that flavor violating effects can also be mediated by the radion @xcite , a graviscalar degree of freedom which might be generically the lightest new physics state and therefore may lead to important phenomenological bounds .",
    "more recently , it has also been pointed out that models with fermions in the bulk give rise to flavor violation in the couplings of higgs to sm fermions @xcite , leading to interesting constraints from @xmath2 processes and to flavor violating collider signatures such as @xmath5 ( see also the most recent analysis of @xcite for further details ) .",
    "other interesting collider effects like rare top decays @xmath6 were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we consider the effect of just two vector - like heavy fermions , one singlet under @xmath7 and one doublet .",
    "this simple case helps us understand in simple terms the effects caused by the full tower of kk fermions in a realistic 5d setup . in section iii we present a calculation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings for the simple model where all the fermions are in a doublet representation of @xmath7 or @xmath8 . in this section and in appendix [ appendixsumrules ]",
    "we also present a simple way to evaluate the complete kk fermion tower contribution to @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings .",
    "having explained and derived the new contributions to the higgs couplings caused by the heavy kk fermions , we proceed in section iv to study quantitatively the main phenomenological effects and outline our conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "we begin by computing the new contribution to the @xmath0 coupling using effective theory with just the zero and first kk modes , where we only consider one family of light quarks ( say , up and down quarks ) augmented by the presence of two heavy vector - like fermions , one in doublet representation of @xmath7 and the other in singlet representation .",
    "this effective theory description has the advantage of being economical and gives lucid physical intuition of the source of new physics contribution .",
    "therefore , we adopt this approach in this section just to illustrate the essential points of our calculation .",
    "moreover , the calculation is more general is the sense that it applies to any beyond standard model ( bsm ) model in which there exist extra vector - like fermions which mix with sm fermions ( see @xcite for a similar discussion ) .",
    "the full calculation of the @xmath0 coupling in the 5d warped extra dimension model will be carried out in the next section .",
    "to start , we review here the higgs boson production through gluon fusion in sm .",
    "the coupling between gluon and higgs mainly comes from top quark loop ( see fig . [ loop ] ) .",
    "the partonic cross section for @xmath9 is @xcite @xmath10     coupling induced by fermion loop.[loop ] ]    where the sum is for all sm fermions , @xmath11 is invariant mass squared of the two incoming gluons , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are yukawa couplings and masses of the quarks , and the form factor for fermion in the loop is @xmath15\\tau^{-2},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 ^ 2,\\quad(\\tau \\le 1 ) ; \\qquad -\\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{1-\\tau^{-1}}}{1-\\sqrt{1-\\tau^{-1}}}\\right ) - i \\pi\\right]^2 , \\quad(\\tau > 1).\\ ] ]    we note that for @xmath17 i.e. @xmath18 , the form factor tends to be unity , while for @xmath19 i.e. @xmath20 , the form factor tends to zero . for reference",
    ", we consider a higgs boson with mass @xmath21 gev , then for c - quark , we have @xmath22 ; and for a kk fermion with mass @xmath23 gev , we have @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , it is a good approximation to treat the form factors for kk fermions as unity , while for light quarks , we can safely ignore their contributions .    in the effective theory with just one kk mode , we have zero mode fermions ( @xmath25 ) and first kk fermions ( @xmath26 ) , where @xmath27 denote the up - type quark from @xmath7 doublet , and @xmath28 denote the up - type quark from @xmath7 singlet",
    ". then we have the following mass matrix : @xmath29 where @xmath30 etc .",
    "are the yukawa couplings between the corresponding chiral fermions , and @xmath31 is the higgs vev ( note that it is not the same as @xmath32 ) .",
    "the yukawa couplings matrix is given by @xmath33    to calculate these fermion contributions to the @xmath0 coupling , we assume that the masses of the kk fermions @xmath34 , and therefore their form factors are approximately unity . before proceeding let us classify different effects contributing to the shift of @xmath0 coupling from that of the sm :    relation between mass and yukawa coupling of the lightest state ( sm fermion ) is modified from the sm value @xmath35 ;    we have loop of kk fermion running in the triangle diagrams ( see fig . [ loop ] ) .",
    "so we should calculate @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the fermion mass and yukawa matrices given in eq .",

    "for simplicity in this paper we everywhere will assume that we have only @xmath40 operator . ] .",
    "the first term on the lhs of the above equation gives the contribution from the sm fermion ( lightest mass eigenstate ) , and the second term comes from the contributions of heavy kk fermions .",
    "note that @xmath41 , therefore , we can use the following trick to calculate the trace @xcite : @xmath42 we also have @xmath43 now we expand to first order in @xmath44 : @xmath45.\\ ] ] note that the masses and yukawa couplings of the sm fermions are also modified ( see @xcite for details ) , @xmath46 where the last expression was derived using the following assumption ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this assumption is true the quarks of the first two generations , and the extra contribution which is important for the quarks of the third generation will be presented in the next section . now",
    "( [ traceformula ] ) reduces to @xmath48 we can see that for the light generation quarks , @xmath49 , we get @xmath50 , which is just the contribution coming from the kk modes . note that this contribution is proportional to @xmath51 , which is the product of yukawa couplings of the kk fermions of opposite chiralities , this structure of the contribution will become essential in calculating the effects in realistic warped model in the next section .",
    "it is interesting to see that even though the light sm quarks give negligible contribution to @xmath0 coupling , their kk partners can give sizable new contributions .",
    "in addition , there would be an multiplicity enhancement of these kk contributions due to the number of flavors .",
    "the analysis above showed that additional vector - like fermions which mix with sm fermions can alter the @xmath0 coupling significantly . in warped extra dimension models with 5d fermions propagating in the bulk",
    ", these extra vector - like fermions naturally come up as the kk towers of fermions .",
    "therefore , we expect generically sizable new physics contributions to @xmath0 coupling in this class of models .",
    "we carry out the detailed calculations in warped extra dimension in the next section .",
    "in this section , we first calculate the kk fermion contributions to @xmath0 coupling in warped extra dimensions ( rs ) .",
    "we then apply similar techniques to calculate both kk fermion and kk gauge boson contributions to @xmath1 coupling .",
    "we show that simple analytical formulas can be obtained for these new physics contributions .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider the effect of the full kk fermion tower on @xmath0 coupling .",
    "we consider models with bulk gauge group @xmath52 , which is motivated to ease the bound from electroweak precision test @xcite .",
    "we consider here just a single family of quarks for the sake of simplicity . a generalization to 3 generation quarks can be easily applied later . for the quark fields , we consider the simple spinorial representation with the following field contents : @xmath53 the first multiplet is a doublet of @xmath7 and the last two are doublets of @xmath8 .",
    "the boundary conditions are denoted for the corresponding chirality .",
    "they have the following yukawa couplings @xmath54 note that @xmath55 , @xmath56 are dimensionless and order one , and @xmath57 is the curvature scale . after kk decomposition in the basis where higgs vev is zero , we have zero modes @xmath58 and the kk modes @xmath59 . for up - type quarks",
    ", we have the following infinite dimensional mass matrix @xmath60 where @xmath61 are kk indices .",
    "the yukawa couplings matrices are defined e.g. by y_q_iu_b^u = y^udz()^5 h(z ) q_l^u,(i)(z ) u_r^(b)(z ) , i.e. it is an integral of product of higgs and fermion wavefunctions , where @xmath62 is a profile of the higgs field normalized in the following way 1=_r^rdz ()^3 h(z)^2 .",
    "the kk mass matrices are diagonal , e.g. @xmath63 .",
    "one naively might think that the couplings @xmath64 vanish in the limit of brane higgs due to the odd boundary conditions of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , so it is safe to ignore them in this matrix .",
    "but these are precisely the @xmath67 odd operators described in detail in @xcite ( detailed analysis without these operators was presented in @xcite ) .",
    "these operators as was shown in @xcite lead to flavor violation in the higgs sector , and they are also essential in evaluating the @xmath0 coupling . to avoid subtleties with wave function being discontinuous at ir brane",
    "we will assume that the higgs is 5d bulk field and only at the end we will take a brane higgs limit .",

    "again , for the light generation quarks there are corrections to the sm fermion masses and yukawa couplings @xcite @xmath70 therefore @xmath71 so the total contribution to @xmath0 coupling by light generation quarks and their kk partners is ( see eq .",
    "[ traceformula ] ) @xmath72 note that this result is very similar to the one we obtained in the last section ( eq . [ eq .",

    "the last term is negligible , and we are left with first two terms .",

    "this can be done for general bulk higgs .",

    "one can also use a rectangular regularization of brane higgs wavefunction which will lead to the same result . ] and eq .",
    "( [ convolutionintegral ] ) now reduces to @xmath78 therefore , for light generations , the contribution to @xmath0 coupling is @xmath79 , which comes just from kk fermions and is independent of fermion bulk mass parameters .    for the third generation quarks",
    "there will be an extra contribution to the formula in ( eq . [ ytopovermtop ] ) which we parameterize following @xcite as @xmath80 ( see appendix [ appendixc ] for details ) .",
    "this gives us additional contribution relative to ( eq . [ hggcoup ] ) @xmath81 also in this case contributions of the sm bottom and top qaurks are no longer negligible , so we have to include them a_1/2(_b)+ a_1/2(_t ) .",
    "note that now yukawa couplings of the top and bottom quarks are shifted ( see discussion in appendix [ appendixc ] ) .",
    "it is simple to generalize the above result to three generations .",
    "the kk towers of the quarks give a contribution proportional to @xmath82 , and we have to combine them with the effect coming from top and bottom quarks .",
    "to summarize , compared with sm , the higgs production cross - section from gluon fusion in rs is @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 , with @xmath86,@xmath87 the shifted top and bottom yukawa couplings in rs ( reference @xcite presented numerical results for the analysis of the brane higgs model including @xmath67 odd operators , however , it is hard to compare it with our result due to different particle content of the models ) .",
    "we consider here the ratio @xmath88 in order to reduce the uncertainty coming from higher order qcd corrections .",
    "it is also important to notice that in the case when the couplings of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not equal the ratio @xmath89 might be quite significant , see discussion and analysis in @xcite .",
    "in the rest of the paper we will assume that @xmath7 and custodial @xmath8 have the same gauge couplings ( see appendix [ appendixb ] for discussion of vev shift in this case ) .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that the same diagrams that contribute to the gluon fusion will also contribute to the modification of the di - higgs production .",
    "this might become an interesting option to disentangle new physics contribution ( see discussion in the effective field theory approach in @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath1 coupling comes from similar diagrams as the one for the @xmath0 coupling , the only difference now is that we have to take into account contributions of the towers of charged kk gauge bosons and kk leptons .",
    "we will again use the simplest custodial model where leptons are in the doublet representation of @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "we can calculate their contribution in the same way as we did for the quarks .",
    "contribution of the kk tower of the @xmath90 was presented in @xcite , so here we just quote their results and the reader can find more details about the derivation in the appendix [ appendixb ] .",

    "we find the set of 5d yukawa couplings and fermion zero mode wavefunctions which give the correct sm quark masses and ckm mixing .",
    "we then calculate @xmath100 and @xmath101 using eq .",

    "[ plotbulk ] that the new physics contribution to @xmath100 tends to be positive and gets larger for lower kk scale .",

    "the sm value is marked by the star . ]    before proceeding further let us stop and see whether we can understand these results intuitively .",
    "first let us focus on the enhancement of the higgs production due to gluon fusion . as we argued in the sections [ 3a ]",
    "these effects come mainly from the modification of the top yukawa coupling and from the loop with kk fermions . as was shown in @xcite top yukawa coupling",
    "is reduced compared to the sm value , so naively one should expect the reduction of the higgs production . but",
    "let us now look on the contribution of the kk modes .",
    "one can see from ( eq . [ eq .",
    "hgg ratio ] ) that this contribution is proportional to @xmath115 which is always positive , so the sign of this contribution is fixed .",
    "also the typical size of this term will be roughly equal to @xmath116 where n is number of sm families and @xmath117 is an average size of the yukawa couplings , so adding both up and down quark kk towers will lead to an overall enhancement factor of 18 .",
    "might become ill defined , and also contribution of the higher order loops with kk fermions and higgs might become important , so the one loop result becomes not reliable if the new physics contribution is much larger than that of the sm . at the same time we would like to note that our result even for the large 5d yukawa couplings will give a typical size of the expected correction to the sm coupling .",
    "] therefore kk fermions give a large positive contribution to @xmath100 .",
    "reduction of the @xmath118 can be understood from the fact that in the sm the dominant contribution comes from the loop with @xmath119 , and the fermion contribution has an opposite sign , thus enhancement of the fermion contributions effectively decreases the overall coupling .",
    "this implication is two - fold .",
    "first , it means that even with a kk scale out of the reach of the lhc ( @xmath120 tev ) , we can still probe the framework of warped extra dimension by precision measurements of various higgs production and decay processes .",
    "second , by comparing our result with that of @xcite , we can see that @xmath100 can be used to distinguish between rs with bulk higgs and holographic pngb higgs model ( or gauge - higgs unification ) . in the latter model , a reduction is usually expected , which can be contrasted with our results for bulk higgs .",
    "note that the difference in these two models comes from the extra symmetry in pngb higgs , which constrains the higgs interactions ( see discussion in @xcite )",
    ".     dependence of @xmath121 on the higgs mass for different values of @xmath122 in bulk higgs scenario with vector - like yukawa couplings ( @xmath106 ) .",

    "[ higgs mass dependence ] the ratio @xmath121 vs. @xmath125 for various kk scales .",
    "we can see that the new physics contribution decreases as @xmath125 increase from @xmath126 to @xmath127 gev .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that in sm , the form factor for the top quark attains its largest value when @xmath128 .",
    "since in rs with bulk higgs , the top quark yukawa coupling is reduced compared to that of sm , there is a larger negative new physics contribution to @xmath0 coupling when @xmath128 , leading to a smaller total new physics contribution .    in fig .",
    "[ plotydependence ] , we plot the dependence of the ratio @xmath121 on the average size of the 5d yukawa couplings .",
    "we can see quite clearly that the size of new physics contribution increases as the 5d yukawa couplings increases .",
    "this is expected from the fact that kk fermion contributions are proportional to @xmath129 . in the framework of flavor anarchy ,",
    "the 5d yukawa couplings are order one .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ plotydependence ] that for order one yukawa couplings , we have sizable new physics contributions to @xmath130 .",

    "is forced by the 5d lorentz symmetry .",
    "but the higgs can be brane localized or even a bulk higgs might have brane localized couplings and these couplings do not have to respect 5d bulk lorentz symmetry .",

    "in conclusion , we summarize the results presented in the paper .",
    "we calculated the corrections to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings in rs at one loop order .",
    "we have found that the new physics states can modify significantly these couplings .",
    "we have shown that the dominant contribution to these coupling comes from the towers of kk fermions running inside triangle diagrams .",
    "we have shown that the kk towers of the light fermions do contribute significantly to these couplings , contrary to the models with higgs being a pngb boson where this contribution is sub - leading .",
    "we have shown that in the models with the higgs in the bulk and yukawa couplings being vectorlike ( @xmath136 ) , @xmath0 coupling becomes enhanced and @xmath1 coupling suppressed compared to that of sm , even though the top yukawa coupling is suppressed compared to the sm value .",
    "this naively counterintuitive result is explained by the fact that the contribution of the kk towers of all sm fermions is so strong that it overcomes the effect from suppression of the top yukawa coupling .",
    "modification of the higgs production cross - section remains significant even for a kk scale far from lhc accessibility .",
    "specifically , we can get order one corrections even with lightest kk modes above 5 tev .",
    "for the generic models with higgs on the brane or bulk higgs with brane yukawa couplings the sign of the effect remains unpredictable .",
    "we might have enhancement as well as suppression , but the parametric size of the effect remains the same .",
    "the total effect comes from collective contributions of the kk partners of all generations .",
    "therefore , the size of these new physics contributions is large , even if the kk fermions are heavy .",

    "let us concentrate on the kk decomposition of the @xmath7 doublet @xmath137 with boundary conditions @xmath138 .",
    "the equations of motion of the kk wavefunctions are @xmath139 we take the first equation and rewrite it as : -m_n q_l^(n ) - z^c_q+2_z(q_r^(n )  z^-c_q-2 ) = 0 .",
    "we now multiply by @xmath140 and integrate between @xmath141 and @xmath142 : [ eqm1 ] -m_n _ r^z_1dz",

    "this effect will lead to the overall modification of the sm @xmath0 and @xmath1 coupling by the factor @xmath145 for ( @xmath146 ) .      to calculate modification of the @xmath1 coupling we also have to calculate contribution coming from the @xmath94 boson . from the lagrangian ( see @xcite ) = (()^2-()^4)w^+_w^- , one can immediately deduce coupling between higgs and @xmath94 .",

    "we derive the contribution of the @xmath90 kk modes to the @xmath1 coupling ( we will closely follow discussion presented in @xcite ) . first let us denote by @xmath147 the mass squared matrix of the charged gauge bosons , then the coupling to the higgs boson will be given by the matrix @xmath148 rotating back to the basis where mass matrix @xmath147 is diagonal we will get c_diag = uu^ , where @xmath149 is a unitary matrix that diagonalizes @xmath150 . we can parameterize the contribution of the gauge boson kk modes to the @xmath1 coupling in the following way : _",

    "let us see how the determinant of the gauge boson mass matrix depends on @xmath158 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the higgs is localized on the ir brane .",
    "we denote by @xmath159 values of the profiles on the ir brane for kk modes of @xmath7 and @xmath8 gauge bosons respectively .",
    "then the mass matrix will look like : m^2=(g_5d^2 f_(0)^2&f_(0)f_(1 ) g_5d^2 &",

    "one can see from the structure of the matrix that the determinant is equal to m^2=g_5d^2 f_(0)^2 _ i , j m_i^2 m_j^2 .",
    "we have checked that for generic bulk higgs @xmath160 , one can calculate it using mixed position momentum propagators .",
    "so the results presented in this section are approximately independent of the higgs localization .",
    "now we can proceed to the evaluation of the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq . kkw gamma ] ) and substituting result for the determinant we get _ n 0 a_1(_n ) & = & ( a_1(_w)+7)- .",

    "we define the following quantity to parameterize the misalignment = - , where @xmath161 are mass matrix and yukawa couplings of the sm fermions",
    ". then it can be split into two parts = _ 1+_2 , where @xmath162 is the main contribution for the light generations and @xmath163 becomes important only for the third generation of quarks .",

    "@xmath165 is a diagonal matrix with elements given by the profiles of the corresponding quarks respectively f(c ) .",
