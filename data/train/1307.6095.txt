    "quantum computing promises fundamentally faster computation than classical computers could ever provide @xcite , but the experimental challenges in building a quantum computer are formidable . the basic theoretical setting for quantum computation",
    ", the quantum circuit model @xcite , has been studied in detail for many years . to implement a quantum circuit",
    "directly requires accurately controlled unitary dynamics in the form of one and multi - qubit gates on a computational register of qubits .",
    "however , both the individual qubit addressability required for single - qubit unitaries and the multi - qubit entangling interactions can be experimentally challenging , each requiring different conditions to optimise their performance .",
    "other schemes have therefore been developed .",
    "one such scheme is measurement - based computation , or the one - way quantum computer , introduced by raussendorf _",
    "_ @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the computation is achieved entirely by single - qubit measurements applied to a highly entangled initial state and classical feedforward dependant on the outcome of each measurement @xcite .",
    "this separates the process into two steps ; first the creation of entanglement which can be done by global operations , and then accurate single - qubit measurements .",
    "another way to increase the physical viability of a scheme is to make use of ` always on ' interactions , such as the heisenberg hamiltonian for a spin chain : this allows the computation to be controlled entirely by precisely - timed global operations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , direct control of the computational qubits can be avoided altogether by using ancilla systems to mediate the interactions .",
    "one such scheme , based on the gate model of quantum computation , is the quantum bus model , or qubus .",
    "the qubus employs a continuous variable ancilla to mediate interactions between qubits in a computational register .",
    "this is done either with homodyne detection of the bus mode @xcite to complete the gates , or via entirely unitary dynamics @xcite . in the latter case case ,",
    "either some access to the qubits for local operations , or more than one form of bus - register interaction , is required .",
    "although only one interaction hamiltonian is necessary , in general the interaction time must be varied to produce different gates .",
    "quantum computations are fragile to the effects of noise , therefore error correction schemes are required , to build in fault - tolerance .",
    "error correction works by duplicating the information in one logical qubit across several physical qubits by forming an entangled state , which can then be used collectively to detect and correct uncorrelated errors arising from noise or inaccurate control operations @xcite .",
    "examples of such schemes include those based on a lattice of qubits with only nearest neighbour interactions @xcite , which can be used to develop fault tolerant fully scalable architectures for quantum computers @xcite .",
    "these error correcting schemes can be layered on top of any universal physical qubit substrate , so long as the architecture avoids the propagation of correlated errors , which are problematic to reliably detect or correct @xcite .",
    "this motivates the study of simple physical quantum architectures which can be fully characterised against the requirements of fault - tolerance and error correction .",
    "a hybrid between the circuit model and measurement - based computation , known as ancilla - driven quantum computation ( adqc ) , was recently developed by anders _",
    "_ @xcite . like the qubus",
    ", no interactions are needed between register qubits .",
    "the computation can be performed using a single fixed interaction between the ancilla and a register qubit , with full control of the ancillary qubit .",
    "the unitary evolution of the register is then driven by back - action onto the register , from measurements of the ancilla .",
    "the evolution is deterministic up to corrections that can be accounted for in the feed - forward , as in the one - way quantum computer @xcite . in both this model and the one - way computer , for a fixed inaccuracy of measurement ,",
    "the gate fidelity decreases with increased overall entanglement @xcite . in the work presented here ,",
    "we take a route to universal quantum computation similar in certain respects to both ancilla - driven and qubus computation .",
    "we begin , as with the ancilla - driven model , with the physically motived constraint of a register of computational qubits to which no access is allowed except through a single interaction , @xmath0 , between an ancilla qubit and a single register qubit at a time .",
    "this is relevant to many experimental setups , particular where there are low - decoherence qubits between which it is hard to implement interactions .",
    "if it is possible to engineer an interaction with an ancillary system over which there is greater control , but which could have a shorter decoherence time , schemes such as the one presented here may be employed .",
    "physical systems with such properties include nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centres in diamonds , where a nuclear spin is strongly coupled to the electron spin of the nv centre @xcite , and the coupling of spin qubits via flying photonic qubits @xcite .",
    "it should however be noted that , in both the model presented here and in adqc , the computational qubit data is stored briefly in the ancillary qubits and so is vulnerable to the decoherence rate of the ancillary system for short periods of time .",
    "the total time the data spends in the ancillary system will scale linearly with the number of gates applied .",
    "looking for a simple , fully unitary model , we enforce further constraints on our scheme .",
    "we will develop a model whereby the ancilla qubit is fully controllable , but where no measurements ( except for final readout ) are required . by fully controllable",
    "we mean that we may perform single - qubit unitaries on the ancilla .",
    "although in practice multiple ancillas would be employed to implement gates in parallel , we will add the restriction that no ancilla - ancilla interactions are required since these could propagate correlated errors .",
    "furthermore we wish to minimise the required physical interactions that need to be engineered , and in any physical realisation of such a scheme it is highly likely that different complementary systems will be employed as ancillary and register qubits .",
    "hence any additional interaction between the ancilla will require a further physically distinct interaction to be engineered . for universal quantum computation , we need to be able to implement , via the ancilla , both single - register - qubit gates and multi - register - qubit entangling gates .",
    "it is desirable to minimise the number of interactions required for each gate .",
    "we will see that any single - qubit gate on a register qubit can be implemented using only two interactions with the ancilla , with unitary control of the ancilla applied in between .",
    "this is in contrast to adqc , where one interaction is sufficient .",
    "although for universal computation only a finite set of single - qubit gates is required , and in practice this is all that will be used , we will determine the interactions that allow _ any _ single - qubit gate to be performed .",
    "this is so that the interactions can be considered universal for our model of computation regardless of which unitaries can be implemented on the ancilla ( as long as some finite universal set can be implemented ) .",
    "it is not possible to implement entangling gates between register qubits via an ancilla sequentially with only unitary dynamics @xcite , that is , by interacting an ancilla with one qubit and then the other without interacting with the first qubit again .",
    "this is in contrast to adqc , where the use of measurement enables this .",
    "we will show , however , that we can perform two - qubit gates with only three ancilla interactions , two with one qubit and one with the other .",
    "we will begin by giving a simple example of an interaction with which we can perform universal quantum computation within the strong constraints of this model , and from there we will characterise _ all _ possible forms this interaction could take .",
    "we will then discuss possible hamiltonians with which this could be implemented and in doing so give a suitable finite universal gate set .",
    "we will refer to our model throughout as ancilla - controlled quantum computation ( acqc ) .",
    "in what follows , all two - qubit unitaries will be denoted by upper case roman letters and single - qubit unitaries by lower case roman letters , with exceptions for well - known operators , such as the pauli operators ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and the hadamard gate ( @xmath5 ) , where the appropriate standard notation is used .",
    "define the computational basis , @xmath6 , by the @xmath7 and @xmath8 eigenstates of the pauli @xmath4 operator respectively . using the standard definitions ,",
    "let @xmath9 @xmath10 which can also be written as matrices in the computational basis : @xmath11@xmath12 if we take the ancilla - register interaction of swap , it is trivial to perform the single - qubit unitaries , simply by swapping the state of the register qubit and ancilla , performing the unitary on the ancilla and then swapping the states back .",
    "however this interaction is not entangling , so it can not create entanglement between register qubits . to use the swap interaction we would need a second ancilla - register interaction , or an ancilla - ancilla interaction , both of which are forbidden in this model .",
    "instead we can use the same method for the single - qubit gates using a different interaction . let the fixed interaction be of the form @xmath13",
    "where @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath16 which in matrix notation is given by @xmath17 we will now show that acqc is possible with this interaction , provided the ancilla is initialised in the @xmath18 state .",
    "we first of all show how to perform arbitrary single - qubit unitaries on a register qubit ( subscript @xmath19 ) , by interacting the register qubit twice with the ancilla ( subscript @xmath20 ) . by linearity , we do not need to consider the whole register .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the action that this operation has on a general single register qubit state , @xmath21 , and an ancilla qubit initially in the state @xmath18 .     a simple example of a single - qubit gate in acqc where the interaction is @xmath22 . ]    as our ancilla is initialised in the state @xmath18 , the initial state is @xmath23 , where @xmath21 is an arbitrary state of one qubit .",
    "we will omit the subscripts to denote which qubit(s ) a state represents , or an operator acts on , when no ambiguity will arise .",
    "we first interact the register qubit and the ancilla : it is simple to confirm that @xmath24 .",
    "we then perform the desired single - qubit unitary , @xmath25 , _ on the ancilla _ , giving the state @xmath26 .",
    "we then repeat the qubit - ancilla interaction giving the final state @xmath27=\\ket{0 } \\otimes u\\ket{\\phi}$ ] .",
    "we have performed the unitary @xmath28 on the register qubit by only manipulating the ancilla and using a fixed interaction twice .",
    "this procedure is shown in figure  [ singlequbitfig ] .",
    "a simple example of a two - qubit entangling gate in acqc where the ancilla - register interaction is @xmath22 and the effective register qubit interaction created is also of this form . ]",
    "it can be seen that if the state of either input qubit is @xmath18 then @xmath29 has the same action as swap . using this , it is simple to see how we can perform two - qubit gates .",
    "our initial state is now @xmath30 where @xmath21 is the ( arbitrary ) state of the two register qubits , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we first interact the ancilla with the first register qubit , which swaps the state of that qubit with the ancilla .",
    "we then interact the ancilla with the second qubit and finally interact the ancilla with the first qubit again , swapping the @xmath18 state back to the ancilla .",
    "this can be seen to be the operation @xmath33 where identity operators are omitted for simplicity .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ twoqubitfig ] .",
    "the overall effect of this sequence of operations is the entangling gate @xmath13 between the two register qubits , where a two - qubit gate is called entangling if it can create entanglement between two qubits initially in a separable state @xcite . as a single entangling gate combined with arbitrary single - qubit unitaries",
    "is sufficient for universal quantum computation @xcite , the above scheme is a universal quantum computer , where the only interaction with the register qubits is via the fixed interaction @xmath22 . to perform the final measurement readout of a register qubit ,",
    "that qubit interacts with the ancilla which is then measured .",
    "we now characterise all possible forms that @xmath29 can take for which this form of computation is possible .",
    "two operators , @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36 u(4 ) , are called _ locally equivalent _ if @xmath37 for some @xmath38 .",
    "_ proposition 1a : _ the _ fixed _ ancilla - register interactions , @xmath39 , that are sufficient for acqc must necessarily be locally equivalent to @xmath40 for some @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is entangling .",
    "the full proof of this is included in appendix a , however it can be outlined as follows . clearly to implement two - register - qubit entangling gates the ancilla - register interaction must be entangling .",
    "we now consider what constraints the need to implement single - qubit unitaries enforces on the form of the interaction . to implement an arbitrary unitary , @xmath28 , on the register in acqc",
    ", we require that for each @xmath28 there exists some @xmath43 such that @xmath44 for all @xmath21 and some initial ancilla state @xmath45 which should not depend on @xmath21 .",
    "this is because in this model we require that any single - qubit unitary can be performed by an interaction with the ancilla , an operation on the ancilla and then a second interaction with the ancilla .",
    "if the state @xmath46 is non - separable for at least some register input , then it can be shown that the final state for that input is non - separable for some @xmath28 , and so hence it is not possible to implement the single qubit unitaries with this choice of interaction and initial ancilla state .",
    "this is done by representing @xmath46 as an entangled state in its schmidt basis and then showing that the _ concurrence _",
    "@xcite ( a measure of entanglement that is zero for product states ) of the final state can not be zero for every @xmath28 .",
    "hence , as non - zero concurrence implies entanglement , we see that if @xmath46 is not separable for some @xmath21 then we can not perform the single qubit unitaries and so hence @xmath46 must be separable for all register input states @xmath21 .",
    "this means that under the ancilla input state @xmath45 , the operator @xmath29 is equivalent to a non - entangling operator .",
    "non - entangling operators are locally equivalent to either the identity or swap @xcite . for @xmath28 to take all possible values in @xmath47 then so must @xmath43 , as the @xmath29 operator is fixed and so the only effect it can have on @xmath43 is constant rotations in @xmath47 . if @xmath29 is equivalent to a separable operator on the input of the ancilla state @xmath45 then we may write @xmath48 for some @xmath49 . under this condition the left hand side of ( [ proof ] ) can be written as @xmath50 .",
    "this state can not be separable for all @xmath43 and @xmath21 as @xmath29 is entangling and so it can not create separable states from all separable inputs which implies that , for this form of @xmath29 , ( [ proof ] ) can not hold for all @xmath43 and @xmath21",
    ". therefore @xmath29 is locally equivalent to swap on the ancilla input of @xmath45 .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that @xmath29 must be locally equivalent to @xmath51 , which concludes the proof .",
    "while it is necessary for the interaction to be locally equivalent to @xmath51 to implement acqc , not every gate that is locally equivalent to @xmath51 is sufficient .",
    "we can instead state the following stronger proposition : _ proposition 1b : _ let @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath45 is the state the ancilla is initialised to before each gate , and define @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "an interaction , @xmath29 , is sufficient for acqc if and only if @xmath29 is of the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the operator that implements @xmath58 on the target ( register ) qubit if the control ( ancilla ) qubit is in the state @xmath54 , for some local unitaries @xmath59 such that @xmath60 is an eigenstate of @xmath58 .",
    "these operators are a subset of those that are locally equivalent to @xmath51 . given an interaction which can be written in the form of ( [ p1b ] ) , there is not necessarily an initial ancilla state that satisfies the above conditions .",
    "the non - local part of the interaction , @xmath61 fixes @xmath62 .",
    "the choice of initial ancilla state is then fixed by @xmath63 but this will not always satisfy the condition that @xmath60 is an eigenstate of @xmath58 . hence it is not only the non - local part of the interaction which determines whether or not it is suitable for acqc but also the local unitaries .",
    "the proof of proposition 1b is shown in appendix a , and follows in a straightforward manner from the proof of proposition 1a .",
    "we will now characterise the possible hamiltonians capable of this form of computation .",
    "let @xmath64 , and define @xmath65 by @xmath66 where in the computational basis @xmath67 the _ local invariants _ of @xmath68 , first introduced by makhlin @xcite , are defined as @xmath69}{16 \\det v } , \\ ] ] @xmath70- \\text{tr}[m^2(v)]}{4 \\det v } \\label{1g},\\ ] ] and are equal for @xmath68 and @xmath71 if and only if @xmath68 and @xmath71 are locally equivalent @xcite . using ( @xmath72 ) it",

    "now as @xmath74=-1 $ ] we have that @xmath75=\\det[\\text{swap}]\\det[v]=-\\det[v].\\ ] ] from ( [ 1 g ] ) it can then be seen that @xmath76 we can parameterise a general @xmath47 matrix , @xmath58 , by @xmath77 using this parameterisation it can be shown that @xmath78 we note that taking @xmath79 in @xmath42 gives a local equivalent of @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , and as from ( [ r ] ) the range of the local invariants for @xmath80 and @xmath42 is the same , that each controlled unitary is locally equivalent to a controlled rotation .",
    "the local invariants of @xmath82 ( and cnot ) are @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite . from ( [ gsv ] ) and ( [ r ] ) it can then be seen that the operators capable of acqc have local invariants @xmath85 a general operator in u(4 ) may be parameterised using the _ canonical decomposition _ as @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where each @xmath90 has period @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "we therefore see that the non - local properties of an operator can be represented by 3 parameters , which are related to its local invariants by @xmath92 @xmath93 as shown in @xcite . setting the equations of ( [ invars ] ) equal to ( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ g2 ] ) results in a pair of simultaneous equations for @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the solutions are the possible values in the canonical decomposition for which the non - local properties of the interaction are those that allow for acqc .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the possible solutions are given by @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 , with remaining coefficient a solution to @xmath100 .",
    "we can then see that the hamiltonian @xmath101 applied for a time @xmath102 , with any choice of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , implements a local equivalent of the unitary @xmath51 where @xmath105 .",
    "the only further constraint is that @xmath106 and @xmath107 must be chosen such that the unitary is not locally equivalent to swap , or equivalently that the unitary is entangling .",
    "the local invariants of swap are @xcite @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    ". hence , from ( [ invars ] ) , @xmath106 and @xmath107 may not be solutions to @xmath110 .",
    "clearly the @xmath90 can be exchanged as @xmath111 and @xmath112 are symmetric in swapping @xmath90 . from these conditions it is simple to show that we can not choose all @xmath90 the same as this results in implementing a local equivalent to swap .",
    "it is also important to note that the local unitaries implemented by the hamiltonian need to satisfy the conditions for acqc given in proposition 1b .",
    "the above conditions only guarantees that the non - local part of the interaction is as required .",
    "we will now find some specific examples of appropriate hamiltonians .",
    "perfect entangler _ is a @xmath113 operator that can produce maximally entangled states from product states .",
    "a controlled gate is a perfect entangler only if it is locally equivalent to @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we wish the interaction , @xmath29 , to be a perfect entangler then we require that @xmath29 is locally equivalent to @xmath22 . from the local invariants of @xmath82 we have that @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "it is straightforward to show from ( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ g2 ] ) that taking @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 in the canonical decomposition , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are integers , gives local equivalents to @xmath22 . in particular",
    ", letting @xmath119 gives the solution @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "therefore the two - qubit xy exchange hamiltonian @xmath123 applied for a time @xmath124 is locally equivalent to @xmath22 .",
    "however , we have seen that local equivalence is not enough to infer that the interaction is capable of implementing acqc . using the spectral theorem",
    "it can be shown that applying this hamiltonian for a time @xmath125 gives the unitary @xmath126 when @xmath124 we have @xmath127 we therefore have that our interaction term is @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "for this interaction to be capable of implementing acqc we require that their exists a choice of initial ancilla state that satisfies the conditions of proposition 1b .",
    "if we write our interaction in the form @xmath130 then the two conditions of proposition 1b are that the initial ancilla state , @xmath45 , must be such that @xmath131 is an eigenstate of @xmath58 and @xmath132 , where @xmath62 is the state such that @xmath55 . as the interaction @xmath133 , expressed in this form , has @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 it is straightforward to see that @xmath139 satisfies these conditions .",
    "it is then simple to show that @xmath140 therefore , in order to implement the unitary @xmath28 on the register , we implement the unitary @xmath141 on the ancilla .",
    "it is then possible to show that the effective two - register - qubit entangling operation is @xmath22 , as @xmath142 up to an irrelevant global phase .",
    "any two - qubit entangling gate , along with arbitrary single - qubit unitaries , is a universal set .",
    "it is however desirable , for error correcting and practicality , to find a finite set that is also universal ( up to arbitrary accuracy ) . as much of the work in developing quantum computation",
    "is based around the @xmath82 or cnot primitives , it is useful to see how we can simulate cnot with our interaction . as the local invariants of @xmath22 are not the same as those of cnot , it is clear that the minimum number of applications of @xmath22 required to implement a cnot is two . using a variation on the results of bremner et .",
    "al . in @xcite",
    "it is possible to derive that @xmath143 up to an irrelevant global phase , where @xmath144 is the hadamard gate . if we can perform each of these single - qubit operations ( or simulate them ) , multiplied on either side by @xmath145 , then we can simulate cnot .",
    "however cnot and all these single - qubit gates are members of the clifford group and so by the gottesman@xmath146knill theorem we need a further single - qubit operation for universal quantum computation based on cnot simulation @xcite .",
    "such an additional gate is the @xmath147 ( or @xmath148)-gate where @xmath149 .",
    "if however we wished to implement the computation entirely by simulating cnot gates , then we could choose an alternative unitary with which it is more convenient to simulate cnot . such a unitary does not need to be a perfect entangler and so does not need to be locally equivalent to @xmath22 .",
    "one such choice arises from taking the hamiltonian @xmath150 this hamiltonian , applied for a time @xmath125 , implements the unitary @xmath151 which at @xmath124 gives @xmath152 it is easy to see that this unitary fulfills the criteria required for acqc , with the choice of initial ancilla state @xmath139 , as it is locally equivalent to @xmath153 , where the local rotations are diagonal .",
    "now we have that @xmath154 which is locally equivalent to c(z ) , and hence cnot , via the local rotation on each qubit of @xmath155 .",
    "the local invariants are given by @xmath156 the _ entangling power _ of a @xmath113 operator , @xmath29 , is defined as the average entanglement produced by @xmath29 when acting on product states @xcite . entangling power can be related to the local invariants of an operator by @xmath157 hence , two operators that have the same @xmath158 have the same entangling power @xcite .",
    "as @xmath159 , we have that @xmath160 .",
    "we therefore see that @xmath161 .",
    "we can implement the single - qubit unitaries as before , however there is a more convenient way to implement the cnot gate , by instead implementing @xmath162 by using the same procedure as earlier for single - qubit gates , we can see that implementing the gate @xmath25 on the ancilla results in the gate @xmath163 being applied to the register qubit .",
    "therefore as @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 we can simulate @xmath82 with only @xmath147 gates and @xmath153 interactions with only a minor @xmath147 gate overhead .",
    "as cnot is locally equivalent to @xmath82 via hadamard rotations and \\{cnot , h , t } is a universal , and fault tolerant , gate set @xcite , a simple universal gate set for this model of computation is the @xmath153 ancilla - register interaction in conjunction with @xmath5 and @xmath147 gates on the ancilla .",
    "we have presented a form of universal quantum computation , acqc , in which the only access required to the computational qubits is via a fixed interaction with a fully controllable ancilla qubit .",
    "in contrast to ancilla - driven quantum computation , the ancillary qubits evolve through unitary dynamics only .",
    "this removes the need for accurate ancilla measurements , except for the final readout , which can potentially increase the speed and fidelity of computation . in order to keep all of the dynamics unitary in acqc",
    ", it was necessary to increase the number of interactions between the ancilla and register qubits in comparison to adqc , from one to two in the case of single - qubit gates , and two to three in the case of two - qubit gates .",
    "it is clear that the relevant source of errors for this model will then be inaccurate unitary control of both the ancillary system and the ancilla - register interaction .",
    "standard error correction protocols can be applied to this scheme if the ancilla is reset ( or a fresh ancilla used ) after the completion of each single or multi - register - qubit gate .",
    "the resetting of the ancilla will remove any residual entanglement between the ancilla and the register , due to imperfect gate implementation , and hence prevent correlated errors from propagating through the computation .",
    "we have shown that any interaction capable of this form of computation is locally equivalent to the swap gate combined with an entangling controlled unitary .",
    "it has been shown that the only interactions that allow ( stepwise ) deterministic ancilla - driven quantum computation , where only pauli corrections are required , as in the one - way quantum computer , are locally equivalent to @xmath82 or @xmath22 , although not all locally equivalent interactions are sufficient @xcite .",
    "this restricts the applicability of deterministic adqc .",
    "it can , however , be generalised to further interactions if probabilistic schemes are employed @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the class of interactions that allow for acqc and those that allow for the ( stepwise ) deterministic ancilla driven model overlap but are not the same . in acqc",
    "we are free to use gates of any non - zero entangling power .",
    "this is because , unlike in adqc , the entangling properties of the interaction are not used to implement the single - qubit gates .",
    "we have given appropriate hamiltonians for implementing this model and some simple universal gate sets .",

    "we do this by first stating a relation that holds only for those @xmath29 that are capable of acqc , and then justify why interactions for acqc must satisfy this relation .",
    "take @xmath52 and let @xmath53 , where @xmath45 is the state to which the ancilla is initialised before each gate .",
    "define @xmath54 such that @xmath55 and let @xmath0 be an entangling operator .",
    "there exists a @xmath168 for each @xmath25 such that @xmath169 @xmath170 @xmath171 only if @xmath172 and @xmath173 is an eigenstate of @xmath58 . it is necessary for ( [ singlequbit ] ) to hold , for all @xmath25 , in order for the single - qubit unitaries to be implementable in the acqc model and hence we require that @xmath29 is of a form that satisfies this condition . the condition that @xmath29 must be entangling is required for the implementation of the two - qubit gates",
    "this is a restating of proposition 1b .",
    "we will now prove the above statement and so hence propositions 1a and 1b .",
    "_ proof : _ it is necessary for ( [ singlequbit ] ) to hold for all possible register input states @xmath21 .",
    "we consider two distinct cases .",
    "either @xmath46 is separable for all register inputs @xmath21 , or it is not separable for at least some @xmath174 .",
    "let us first consider the case where it is not separable for at least some particular register input @xmath175 . using the schmidt decomposition theorem",
    ", we have that @xmath176 for some orthonormal basis @xmath177 and @xmath178 , and real , positive coefficients @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "as the state is not separable , we have that @xmath181 . now for ( [ singlequbit ] ) to be satisfied for all @xmath25 we require that @xmath182 is separable for all @xmath168 .",
    "this is because for @xmath28 to take all possible values in @xmath47 then so must @xmath43 , as the @xmath29 operators are fixed and so the only effect they can have on @xmath43 is constant rotations in @xmath47 .",
    "we parameterise @xmath29 using the canonical decomposition , giving the condition that @xmath183 is separable for all @xmath43 , where @xmath87 . as",
    "a schmidt basis is separable , then if we represent this in a schmidt basis , @xmath184 may still be written in the same form as when represented in the computational basis , as the basis changing rotations can be absorbed into the arbitrary @xmath185 matrices . using the spectral theorem , in the computational basis @xmath186 with @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , @xmath192 .",
    "we therefore have that in the schmidt basis of @xmath193 we can write the left hand side of ( [ singlequbit ] ) as @xmath194 for the left hand side to be equal to the right hand side of ( [ singlequbit ] ) we require that the left hand side is separable .",
    "clearly the terms acting after @xmath184 can have no effect on the separability of the state , and so we require that , relabelling @xmath195 by @xmath196 , and for labelling simplicity letting @xmath197 that @xmath198 is separable for all @xmath199 .",
    "we now calculate the concurrence of this state , where the concurrence of a pure state is given by @xmath200 with @xmath201 . in order for this state to be separable for all @xmath196",
    "this must be zero for all @xmath196 . by parameterising @xmath196 , this results in 10 simultaneous equations .",
    "here we write only 3 of them as that is all that is required for a contradiction .",
    "they are @xmath202 @xmath203 = 0 \\label{sim2}\\ ] ] @xmath204 where the @xmath205 are the components of @xmath185 .",
    "now if @xmath206 , then due to unitarity we have @xmath207 and @xmath208 and @xmath209 are non - zero . from equation ( [ sim1 ] ) , we therefore have that @xmath210 . but",
    "now ( [ sim3 ] ) gives that @xmath211 .",
    "this implies that @xmath212 which contradicts the unitarity of @xmath184 .",
    "the same argument applies if @xmath213 .",
    "we therefore have that all the components of @xmath185 are non - zero .",
    "we now take a parametrisation of @xmath185 as @xmath214 as all the components are non - zero ( [ sim2 ] ) gives that @xmath215 , but ( [ sim3 ] ) gives that @xmath216 .",
    "therefore @xmath217 , but from our parameterisation of @xmath185 we have @xmath218 , so we have a contradiction .",
    "we assumed that @xmath219 was non - separable for at least some @xmath21 and have shown that for that register input the left hand side of ( [ singlequbit ] ) is not separable for at least some @xmath168 and so hence ( [ singlequbit ] ) can not hold .",
    "therefore , we have shown that the state @xmath220 must be separable for all register inputs @xmath21 to satisfy ( [ singlequbit ] ) for all @xmath43 .",
    "if it is separable for all @xmath21 , we may write @xmath221 for some @xmath222 and @xmath223 . we need this to hold for all register inputs @xmath21 .",
    "as this is a non - entangling mapping for all register inputs , we have that under the ancilla input of @xmath45 , the entangling operator @xmath29 creates no entanglement for any register input .",
    "the only u(4 ) operators that create no entanglement for all input states are locally equivalent to the identity or to swap . therefore under the ancilla input state @xmath45 , @xmath29 has the effective operation of one of these two operators .",
    "that implies that either @xmath224 and @xmath225 , or @xmath226 and @xmath227 for some @xmath228 u(2 ) .",
    "now we require that @xmath229 is separable for all @xmath43 .",
    "however if we take the first possible choice for @xmath222 , and @xmath223 we have that @xmath230 is separable for all @xmath43 and @xmath21 .",
    "this is not possible as this implies that @xmath29 creates separable states for all separable input states , which contradicts our demand that @xmath29 is entangling .",
    "we therefore have the latter of our two options , that is that @xmath231 for all @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore must be able to write @xmath29 in the form @xmath232 where @xmath233 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 for all @xmath236 , where @xmath237 and @xmath238 . in the @xmath62 , @xmath239 basis @xmath240 for all @xmath179 , @xmath180 such that @xmath241 .",
    "this partially defines @xmath242 .",
    "if we represent @xmath242 in the @xmath62 , @xmath54 basis ( for both qubits ) , which we denote @xmath243_{\\psi}$ ] to distinguish between an operator and its representation in a particular basis , this fully defines the first two columns as @xmath244 _",
    "{ \\psi } =   \\begin{pmatrix } 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & p_{11 } & p_{12 } \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & p_{21 } & p_{22 } \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] for some unitary @xmath245 u(2 ) .",
    "we have that @xmath244 _ { \\psi } =   \\begin{pmatrix } 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix }   \\begin{pmatrix } 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & p_{11 } & p_{12 }   \\\\ 0 & 0 & p_{21 } & p_{22 } \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] as swap has the same matrix representation in any seperable basis where the same basis is used for each qubit , we therefore have @xmath246 .",
    "so we now have that @xmath247 where @xmath248 and @xmath57 is entangling .",
    "we have therefore proven proposition 1a , as @xmath61 is locally equivalent to @xmath51 .",
    "we now wish to enforce the full required condition of ( [ singlequbit ] ) , and hence prove proposition 1b . we put the current form of @xmath29 into this equation which , after applying the first @xmath29 operator to the state , gives @xmath249 now if the left hand side of this is to be a product state we must have that @xmath250 is separable for all @xmath251 where @xmath252 , @xmath253 .",
    "therefore we require @xmath254 to be separable for all @xmath179 and @xmath180 such that @xmath241 .",
    "this is only true if @xmath255 is an eigenstate of @xmath58 .",
    "let the eigenvalue be @xmath256 .",
    "we then have that the final state is @xmath257 where @xmath258 .",
    "so to apply @xmath28 to the register we apply @xmath259 to the ancilla .",
    "we have shown that @xmath29 must be of the form @xmath260 and furthermore that @xmath261 and @xmath262 is an eigenstate of @xmath58 .",
    "this is the form of @xmath29 claimed in proposition 1b .",
    "we have seen that all interactions that allow for acqc must be of this form .",
    "it is then simple to see that all such interactions are sufficient for acqc .",
    "the above proof shows how to implement the single - qubit gates . to implement the two - qubit gates we start with the same initial ancilla state as for the single - qubit gates , interact first with one qubit , then with the other qubit and then again with the first",
    "this implements an effective @xmath29 interaction , up to some local rotations , between the two register qubits .",
    "hence such interactions are necessary and sufficient for acqc .",
    "this concludes the proof of proposition 1b ."
