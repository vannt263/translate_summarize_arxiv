    "a periodic train of excitation is generated which propagates outward from the center , or core , of the spiral .",
    "much of the historical study of excitable media has focused on the wave character of the problem , as illustrated by efforts to determine the selection of the spiral shape and rotation frequency  @xcite .",
    "however , it is now understood that these spiral waves also have particle - like properties .",
    "this was first brought to the forefront by biktasheva and biktashev  @xcite and has been developed in more recent years @xcite .",
    "one of the more striking illustrations of a particle - like property is _ resonant drift _",

    "details are given later in the text.,width=312 ]    the trajectories of drifting spirals are unaffected by the domain boundaries ( or other spirals should they be present ) except on close approach , where often the result is a reflection of the drifting core @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro](c ) . reflections are not specular  the reflected angle @xmath0  is not in general equal to the incident angle @xmath2 .",
    "when placed in a square box , the drift trajectory typically will ricochet off each boundary in such a way to eventually be attracted to a unique square path where @xmath3 , as shown in figure  [ fig : intro](d ) .",
    "( this is the more common case , but others are considered herein . )    the primary goal of this paper is firstly to determine accurately , through numerical simulations , the relationship between reflected and incident angles for some representative cases of spiral waves in excitable media , and secondly to explore the qualitative features of reflections in excitable media , particularly multiple reflections in square domains . while the numerical and theoretical study of reflecting trajectories was undertaken by biktashev and holden many years ago  @xcite , much more extensive results are now possible and desirable , especially since phenomena strikingly similar to that seen in figs .",

    "our study is based on the standard barkley model describing a generic excitable medium  @xcite . in the simplest form",
    "the model is given by the reaction - diffusion equations @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the excitation field ( plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] ) and @xmath6 is the recovery field ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are parameters . the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 collectively control the threshold for and duration of excitation while the parameter @xmath9 controls the excitability of the medium by setting the fast timescale of excitation relative to the timescale of recovery .",
    "we consider two parameter regimes  known commonly as the small - core and large - core regimes .",
    "the small - core case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] .",
    "as the name implies , the core region of the spiral , where the medium remains unexcited over one rotation period , is small .",
    "this is the more generic case for the barkley model and similar models and occupies a relatively large region of parameter space in which waves rotate periodically .",
    "small - core spirals are found in the lower right part of the standard two - parameter phase diagram for the barkley model ( see figure 4 of ref .  ) .",
    "large - core spirals rotate around relatively large regions [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : large_core_intro](a ) discussed below ] .",
    "such spirals occur in a narrow region of parameter space @xcite near the boundary for propagation failure .",
    "the core size diverges to infinity near propagation failure .",
    "parametric forcing is introduced through periodic variation in the excitability .",
    "specifically we vary @xmath9 according to @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the forcing amplitude and frequency .",
    "the phase @xmath13 is used to control the direction of resonant drift . the forcing frequency",
    "producing resonant drift will be close to the natural , unforced , spiral frequency .",
    "however , due to nonlinearity , there is a change in the spiral rotation frequency under forcing and so @xmath12 must be adjusted with @xmath11 to produce resonant drift along a straight line .",
    "we have studied reflections in two situations .",
    "the first is reflection from a no - flux boundary .",
    "this type of boundary condition corresponds to the wall of a container containing the medium .",
    "we set the reflection boundary to be at @xmath14 and impose a homogeneous neumann boundary condition there : @xmath15 since there is no diffusion of the slow variable , no boundary condition is required on @xmath16 .",
    "the medium does not exist for @xmath17 .",
    "the second situation we have studied is reflections from a step change in excitability across a line _ within _ the medium .",
    "we locate step change on the line @xmath14 .",
    "we vary the threshold for excitation across this line by having the parameter @xmath8 vary according to @xmath18 unlike for the no - flux boundary , in this case waves may cross the line @xmath14 and so there is no boundary to wave propagation",
    ". nevertheless , drifting spirals may reflect from this step change in the medium and we refer to this a _",
    "step boundary_.    the numerical methods for solving the reaction - diffusion equations are standard and are covered elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "some relevant computational details particular to this study of spiral reflections are as follows .",
    "a converged spiral for the unforced system is used as the initial condition .",
    "simulations are started with parametric forcing and the spiral drifts in a particular direction dictated by the phase @xmath13 in eq .  .",
    "the position of the spiral tip is sampled once per forcing period and from this the direction of drift , i.e.  the incident angle @xmath2 , is determined by a least - squares fit over an appropriate range of drift ( after the initial spiral has equilibrated to a state of constant drift , both in speed and direction , but before the spiral core encounters a boundary ) . likewise , from a fit to the sampled tip path after the interaction with the boundary , we determine the reflected angle @xmath0 . by",
    "varying @xmath13 we are able to scan over incident angles .",
    "the simulations are carried out in a large rectangular domain with no - flux boundary conditions on all sides . for reflections from a neumann boundary  , we simply direct waves to the computational domain boundary corresponding to @xmath14 .",
    "we also study reflections more globally from all sides of a square domain with neumann boundary conditions , such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro](d ) . in the study of reflections from the step boundary",
    ", the computational domain extends past the step change in parameter .",
    "we have run cases with the left computational boundary both at @xmath19 and @xmath20 and these are sufficiently far from @xmath14 that trajectory reflection is not affected by the computational domain boundary .",
    "the dimensions of the rectangular computational domain are varied depending on the angle of incidence .",
    "for @xmath21 we require a long domain in the @xmath22-direction , whereas for @xmath23 a much smaller domain may be used . in all cases",
    "we use a grid spacing of @xmath24 .",
    "the time step is varied to evenly divide the forcing period , but @xmath25 is typical . except where stated otherwise , the model parameters for the small - core case are : @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . for the large - core case they are @xmath28 , and @xmath27 . for the step boundary @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "different values of the forcing amplitude and period , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are considered .",
    "given the desire to measure incident and reflected angles precisely , we have required drift be along straight lines to high precision and in turn this has required high accuracy in the imposed forcing amplitude and period . in the appendix we report the exact values for the forcing parameters used in the quantitative incidence - reflection studies .",
    "before presenting results from our study of reflections , it is important to be precise about the meaning of incident and reflected angles . as is standard ,",
    "angles are measured with respect to the boundary normal .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig : large_core ] , most evident at large forcing amplitudes .",
    "these wiggles are also due to the fact that the phase of spirals on close approach varies with incident angle .",
    "figure  [ fig : large_core_paths](e ) illustrates how the reflected angle depends on phase by showing two trajectories shifted by half a core diameter .",

    "many years ago biktashev and holden  @xcite carried out a study very similar in spirit to that presented here .",
    "moreover , they understood that a primary cause for the reflection from boundaries was the small changes in spiral rotation frequency occurring as spiral cores came into interaction with boundaries .",
    "based on this they proposed an appealing simple model to describe spiral reflections .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that both the instantaneous drift speed normal to the boundary and spiral rotation frequency are affected by interactions with a boundary , with the interactions decreasing exponentially with distance from the boundary .",
    "while the actual interactions between spiral and boundaries are now known to be more complex ( see below ) , it is worth investigating what these simple assumptions give .",
    "the beauty of the simple model is that it can be solved to obtain a relationship between reflected and incident angles , depending on only a single combination of phenomenological parameters .",

    "curves from the biktashev - holden theory are included in figs .",

    "these occur when the reflected angle is smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "( it is possible that @xmath100 might occur for small - core spirals in some regimes , although we have not observed them . )",
    "when @xmath100 it is not necessarily the case that trajectories will strike consecutive sides of a square box .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : large_core_other](a ) where the spiral in reflects between opposite sides of the domain .",
    "the reflections satisfy @xmath101 .",
    "the more interesting case is when @xmath56 is only slightly less than @xmath76 as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : large_core_other](b ) .",
    "the square trajectory is unstable . while @xmath85 and the angles converge quickly to @xmath102 , the equation @xmath103 exhibits growing period - two oscillations for @xmath104 slightly larger than 1 .",
    "period - two oscillations in @xmath87 with @xmath102 correspond to approximately rectangular trajectories that approach a diagonal .",
    "this ultimately leads the spiral into a corner of the domain where it may reflect in complicated manner .",
    "the analysis just presented should not be viewed as a model for spiral trajectories .",
    "rather it just shows what global dynamics can be deduced simply from a measured relationship between incident and reflected angles .",
    "essentially this same analysis appears as part of a study of cavity solitions @xcite which also undergo non - specular reflections from walls and hence exhibit square orbits similar to figure  [ fig : intro](d ) .",
    "our simple analysis should be contrasted with the situation for drops bouncing on the surface of an oscillating liquid , so called _",
    "walkers_. here physical models of the liquid surface and drop bounces account for many varied features of the system  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding theory for spiral waves would be that based on response functions in which many details of drift trajectories can be predicted @xcite , although as of yet not reflections from boundaries .",
    "memory effects are important for walkers because bouncing drops interact with surface waves generated many oscillations in the past , and models necessarily take this into account  @xcite .",
    "however , path memory is absent from spiral waves in excitable media and this constitutes a significant difference between the two systems .",
    "we have reported some quantitative and some qualitative features of resonant - drift trajectories in excitable media .",
    "the main message is that reflections are far from specular  the reflected angle generally depends only weakly on the incident angle and typically is nearly constant over a substantial range of incident angles ( particularly negative incident angles ) .",
    "biktashev - holden theory  @xcite accounts for some of the observed features , but a more detailed theory based on response functions  @xcite is needed .",
    "we have seen that the behavior of large - core spirals is more varied than that for small - core ones . rather than simply reflecting from a boundary",
    ", large - core spirals may sometimes become bound to , or glance from , or be annihilated at a boundary , even at moderate forcing amplitudes .",
    "finally we have considered what can occur as spirals undergo multiple reflections within a square domain , and in particular have shown that while small - core spirals are observed to meet the conditions of stable square trajectories , large - core spirals may fail to meet these conditions and exhibit more interesting dynamics .",
    "we motivated this study with a broader discussion of macroscopic systems with wave - particle duality .",
    "a large number of analogues to quantum mechanical systems have been reported for walkers on the surface of a vibrated liquid layer @xcite . as far as we are aware , this is less the case for the propagating wave segments studied by showalter _",
    "et al._@xcite or the drifting spirals in excitable media considered here .",
    "( we examined briefly small - core drift trajectories through a single slit , but did not observe diffraction - like behavior . ) nevertheless , for the reflection problem , spiral trajectories , propagating wave segments , cavity solitons , and walkers all share the feature of non - specular reflections  @xcite and as a result these systems can show similar dynamics when undergoing multiple reflections within a bounded region  @xcite .",
    "it will be of interest to make further quantitative comparisons between these different systems in the future and to explore theoretical basis of this behavior .",
    "in the appendix we report the exact values for the forcing parameters used in the detailed quantitative incidence - reflection studies , since obtaining high - precision values for resonant drift can be time consuming .",
    "the values stated in the body of the paper are reported only to two significant figures .",
