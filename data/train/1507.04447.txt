    "such merger events are ubiquitous throughout the universe and as such , probing the details of the merger process is key to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution ( @xmath0 * ? ? ?",
    "for example , star - formation ( sf ) initiated by interactions could well be a key factor in transforming blue star - forming discs into red , passively evolving quiescent spheroids .",
    "however , the details of how sf responds to galaxy interactions are somewhat vague and are likely to be strongly linked to pair mass ratio and pair separation .",
    "traditionally , observational studies of close pairs have highlighted strong evidence that sf is enhanced through interactions and that the strongest enhancement occurs in the closest pairs ( those at projected separations of @xmath330kpc , @xmath0 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , detailed multi - wavelength analyses of blue compact dwarf galaxies have shown that , in the majority of the cases , interactions with or between low - luminosity dwarf galaxies or hi clouds are the triggering mechanism of their strong star - formation activity @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have studied a large sample of star - forming galaxies in pairs taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and find clear evidence for enhanced , emission - line derived sf out to significant pair separations ( @xmath4kpc ) .",
    "they also find that the enhancement in sf is inversely proportional to pair separation , with the closest pairs displaying the largest enhancement .",
    "this result is echoed by @xcite who perform a similar analysis for isolated pair galaxies in the prism multi - object survey ( primus ) but determine star - formation rates ( sfrs ) using attenuation corrected ultraviolet(uv)-optical colours .",
    "they find pairs at separations of @xmath5kpc show bluer far - ultraviolet minus r - band ( fuv-@xmath6 ) colours than a control sample of non - pair galaxies ( indicative of larger sfrs ) .",
    "moreover , this sfr enhancement is more pronounced at closest pair separations ( @xmath7kpc ) .",
    "@xcite perform a similar analysis on sdss pairs and , in addition to sf enhancement , find that sf is most strongly enhanced in major merger systems , hinting that pair mass ratio is significant in the modification of sf history through galaxy interactions . in a distinct but complementary approach ,",
    "@xcite find that 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) selected star - busts are more likely to have a neighbour of comparable brightness within 20kpc , and 30% of star - bust galaxies show morphological signatures of interactions and mergers - suggesting that the sf in these systems is induced by a galaxy - galaxy interaction .",
    "however , by contrast @xcite also find strong enhancement of sf in interactions but suggest that there is little correlation between this enhancement and the relative luminosity of the interacting galaxies ( and therefore , pair mass ratio ) .",
    "they do also find that the enhancement of sf is stronger for lower mass systems . by splitting individual interacting galaxies into high ( @xmath8>=10.6 $ ] ) and low ( @xmath8>=9.72 $ ] ) stellar mass samples",
    ", they find that at a given pair separation , sf is enhanced more strongly in low mass than high mass pair galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations offer further insight into the complexities of these interaction sf processes .",
    "@xcite model several hundred galaxy close pair interactions ( @xmath9kpc ) for various morphological classes , and find that while sf is primarily enhanced in galaxy interactions , mergers do not always trigger starbursts , and galaxy interactions are not always sufficient to convert high gas masses into new stars .",
    "they also highlight that the amount by which sf is enhanced is anticorrelated with pair separation on small scales ( @xmath10 galaxies which have a very close passage produce the lowest bursts of sf ) , as well as the amplitude of tidal forces ( @xmath10 pairs that undergo less intense tidal forces can preserve higher gas masses for future sf during the merger ) .",
    "these simulations suggest that sf enhancement is not ubiquitous in interactions and that sf is likely to vary as a function of pair separation and pair mass ratio - higher mass ratios will induce more significant tidal effects in the lower mass galaxy in the pair removing the bulk of its gas and as such , starving sf .",
    "recently we have seen tentative observational evidence in support of these simulation predictions for close pairs .",
    "@xcite studied l@xmath11 galaxies in closely interacting pairs taken from the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) galaxy group catalogue ( g@xmath12c ) , and investigate variations in sf as a function of pair mass ratio .",
    "they find that primary ( higher mass ) pair galaxies have their sf enhanced , but only when the pair mass ratio is close to 1 . while the secondary ( lower mass ) galaxy has its sf suppressed relative to equivalent stellar mass non - pair galaxies .",
    "in addition , @xcite find that close pairs galaxies are consistently redder than a similarly selected comparison sample , and suggest that these systems have been `` harassed '' in multiple previous passes prior to the current close interaction .",
    "these results give the first tentative observational evidence that sf in interacting systems is more complicated than the traditional evidence would suggest , and highlights that pair mass ratio may play a vital role in the changes to sf induced by an interaction .",
    "however , questions still remain regarding the details of sf in interacting systems , such as how does sf proceed in interactions as a function of pair separation when considering pair samples split by merger ratio , primary or secondary status and individual galaxy mass ?",
    "a potentially more significant question is over what timescales do variations in the sfr in interacting systems become apparent ?",
    "if we measure sfrs using observational tracers which probe different sf timescales , will we see differences in observed sfrs ?",
    "sf enhancement / suppression in interactions is likely to occur on short timescales , and hence , may only be apparent in sfr measures which probe short periods of the galaxy s sf history .    in this paper , we further investigate sf in closely interacting pairs taken from the g@xmath12c catalogue .",
    "we split our sample on merger ratio , primary or secondary status and galaxy mass , and investigate sf characteristics as a function of pair separation .",
    "we determine sfrs for each galaxy using multiple nebular emission line and continuum fluxes , which probe the galaxy s sf history over different timescales , and compare these methods in order to identify short timescale variations in sf , once again as a function of pair separation . in this manner",

    "we utilise the first 5 years of data obtained and frozen for internal team use , referred to as gama ii .",

    "briefly , pairs are selected on physical projected separation , @xmath26 ( for the cosmology given in section [ sec : intro ] ) and radial velocity separation , @xmath27 . in this paper",
    "we use systems which meet the pair criteria of @xcite :    @xmath28    this sample consists of a total of 37,679 galaxies in pairs .",
    "we further restrict our sample to pairs at @xmath29 in order to minimise the impact of redshift evolution in our galaxies and biases towards the identification of high mass pairs at the high redshift end , giving a total of 33,832 pair galaxies .",
    "we then match all pair galaxies to the gama ii panchromatic photometry catalogue ( driver et al in prep ) and use rest - frame photometry derived from a refactored implementation of the interrest algorithm @xcite , coupled with the empirical set of galaxy template spectra of @xcite .",
    "we exclude any galaxy classed as an agn using the classifiers described above , leaving 32,468 pair galaxies .",
    "we use the stellar masses derived from the @xmath30 photometry for all gama ii galaxies @xcite to assign classes to each individual galaxy .",
    "firstly , we determine whether each galaxy is the primary or secondary system in the interacting pair ( by mass ) .",
    "secondly , we calculate the pair mass ratio and identify each system as being either part of a major merger ( mass ratio @xmath33:1 ) or minor merger ( mass ratio @xmath243:1 ) .",
    "note that we also split our minor merger sample further into 3:1@xmath3mass ratio@xmath36:1 and mass ratio@xmath246:1 subsamples , but see little difference between each of these populations .",
    "as such , we do not discuss them in this work .    a potential caveat to the selection above , is that we may be biased towards pair systems where both galaxies are star - forming , specifically at the low mass and/or high redshift end - where we are not mass complete .",
    "for example , by purely applying a redshift selection we are more sensitive to higher stellar mass and , potentially star - forming , galaxies . as such",
    ", low mass systems will only be identified as being in an interaction if both pair galaxies are high mass and/or highly star - forming . likewise ,",
    "if we were to only apply a mass selection over the full sample , we do not take into account the broad redshift range of our selection and any evolution of the star - forming properties of galaxies across this extensive look - back time .",
    "as such , our pair sample will be biased to wards specific galaxy populations and we will dilute any observed trends by not taking into account the global change in star - formation properties of galaxies with redshift . in order to remove this affect , we compare all of our pair galaxy samples to a mass and redshift matched control sample .",
    "the control sample contains the same mass bias and redshift evolution as the pairs sample , and as such removes any dependancy on this effect ( gama is essentially 100% complete in the @xmath6-band , thus sources will also not drop out of our pairs selection preferentially to our control sample due to the effect of the interaction on sf - where the @xmath6-band will not be strongly affected ) .",
    "as such , we can directly compare the effects of an interaction to non - interacting galaxies at the same stellar mass and redshift .",
    "our control sample is defined further in sec . [",
    "sec : independent ] . in this paper",
    "we only display our results in comparison to this control sample , and as such are not biased by our mass incompleteness .",
    "we note that in defining our control sample based on stellar mass and redshift , we are not taking into account the different galaxy clustering statistics of passive and active systems .",
    "passive galaxies are more strongly clustered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and as such , more likely to be in pairs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the fraction of quiescent galaxies in major mergers at @xmath31 ) .",
    "this could potentially bias our control sample towards a higher fraction of actively star - forming systems .",
    "however , we do not wish to perform any sample selection based on star - formation diagnostics , as the increased fraction of passive systems in pair galaxies may in fact be caused by the galaxy interactions - the very the effect we wish to measure here .",
    "as we will see , the majority of sub - samples in our analysis show enhanced star - formation in close pairs , a result that would only be reduced by the potential biases discussed above .",
    "in addition , we see distinct differences between the primary and secondary galaxies of minor mergers in our sample .",
    "any bias produced by different clustering statistics would affect both populations in the same manner .",
    "hence , such a bias is unlikely to be driving this result .    in all of the subsequent analysis in this paper",
    ", we consider each pair galaxy member individually , but split our samples into primary and secondary galaxies , and major and minor mergers based on the classification within their pair system .",
    "we also further split our samples by the stellar mass of each individual galaxy as noted above . for reference ,",
    "table [ tab : numbers ] shows the number of galaxies in each mass bin as a function of primary or secondary status and major or minor merger classification .",
    ".number of pair sources ( each pair galaxy is treated individually ) in each mass bin as a function of primary or secondary system status and major or minor merger classification . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : numbers2 ]    the left columns of figures [ fig:100micron ] - [ fig : ha ] display sfr@xmath32 for our full sample of pair galaxies as a function of pair separation split on stellar mass and into primary and secondary galaxy within the pair ( green and orange lines respectively ) .",
    "the coloured polygons show the standard error on the mean for the pairs and non - pairs summed in quadrature at each radial distance . in the middle and right columns of these figures we split our samples further into major and minor mergers respectively .",
    "a potential pitfall of this analysis is that poor resolution of continuum observations used in this work mean that in many cases close systems share the same resolution element . while attempts have been made to deblend fluxes into individual sources , this may lead to systematic errors in our result .",
    "for instance , the secondary galaxy in a pair may have its emission systematically boosted / suppressed via deblending with the primary galaxy and vice versa . in the following figures we display the physical size of the psf fwhm of the primary instrument used in calculating the star - formation rate ,",
    "scaled to the median redshift of our pairs sample , as a dashed blue vertical line . as such",
    ", sources within this line may have uncertainties on their sfrs which arise from source confusion .",
    "however , we note that if real , such uncertainties in this region should be mirrored between primary and secondary populations , @xmath10 if secondary galaxies systematically have their fluxes underestimated at close pair separations , then primary galaxies should systematically have their fluxes enhanced , as total flux must be distributed between the two sources via deblending .",
    "this effect is also likely to be minimal in the magphys results which use the full sed to estimate sfrs .",
    "we also note that this effect will not be apparent in the h@xmath1 measurements , where the fibre aperture size is much smaller then the physical separation between galaxies . in sec .",
    "[ sec : compare ] we compare the slopes of these distributions .",
    "however , we note here that we consider slopes for both the full range of pair separations , and only at separations larger then the blue line ( and so not affected by source confusion ) and the results are consistent , albeit at lower significance .    below we highlight key observables from figures [ fig:100micron ] - [ fig : ha ] ,",
    "these will be discussed further in the following sections :                            @xmath33 * sfr@xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:100micron ] ) * - firstly considering our full sample ( left column ) , we find no strong enhancement or suppression of sfr@xmath34 as a function of pair separation - with both primary and secondary pair galaxies showing no real excess / deficit in comparison to the control sample at all pair separations .",
    "this is consistent with the results seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : aaron_class ] , that there is no significant difference in fir measure ssfr when considering close- , intermediate- and far - pairs .",
    "splitting this sample into major and minor mergers , we find that the major merger systems ( middle column ) are almost identical to the full pairs sample and also show no excess / deficit in sf .",
    "however , in minor merger systems we see some differences between primary and secondary galaxies .",
    "primary galaxies show marginal enhancement of sf as a function of decreasing pair separation ( especially in the 10.0@xmath3log@xmath35[m*]@xmath310.5 range - middle panel of the right column ) , while secondary galaxies show a deficit in sf in comparison to the control sample . this suppression also appears stronger with increasing stellar mass ( from top to bottom of the right column ) .",
    "we also note that , while this suppression is most apparent at very close pair separations , the trend of increasing deficit in sf as a function of pair separation begins outside of the pacs 100@xmath36 m psf ( blue vertical dashed line ) and as such is not likely to be driven by deblending confusion .",
    "@xmath33 * sfr@xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : w4 ] ) * - for all samples using our mir sfr indicator we see marginal enhancement of sf as a function of decreasing pair separation ( all samples have a weak slope which increases to small pair separations ) .",
    "we see little difference between primary and secondary galaxies in all samples .",
    "@xmath33 * sfr@xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uv_tir ] ) * - for our uv+tir sfr indicator we find no strong enhancement / suppression of sf with decreasing pair separation .",
    "we do see some enhancement in sf for major mergers in our lowest mass bin ( top panel of the middle column ) , and a minor difference between the primary and secondary galaxies in minor mergers at 10.0@xmath3log@xmath35[m*]@xmath310.5 ( middle panel of right column ) .",
    "@xmath33 * sfr@xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nuv ] ) * - for the first of our short duration sfr indicators ( @xmath40myr ) we start to see strong trends in our samples as a function of pair separation . for all pair galaxies combined ( left column ) we find increasing sf with deceasing pair separation for both primary and secondary galaxies .",
    "splitting into major and minor mergers , for major mergers we find that primary and secondary galaxies look identical , both have increasing star - formation with decreasing pair separation .",
    "however , for minor mergers we see subtle differences between primary and secondary galaxies .",
    "the primary galaxies show a similar relation to those in major mergers , while the secondary galaxies have no enhancement / suppression of sf with pair separation , except for the closest pairs . as with our fir indicator",
    ", there is also a subtle suggestion that the normalisation of the secondary galaxies in minor mergers scales as a function of galaxy mass , with higher mass galaxies appearing more suppressed than lower mass galaxies ( the orange line is lower in the bottom panel than the top panel of the right column ) .",
    "we do not display both fuv and nuv figures as both distributions are almost identical , but with slight normalisation scaling .",
    "@xmath33 * sfr@xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : magphys ] ) * - our sfr@xmath41 measure displays similar results to the sfr@xmath39 , but also with a slight normalisation change ( this is not surprising as they are all derived from the magphys fits ) .",
    "however , for minor mergers and our highest mass bin ( bottom right panel ) we now see clear suppression of secondary galaxies at close pair separations .",
    "@xmath33 * sfr@xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ha ] ) * - here we see the strongest variation in sfrs as a function of pair separation and the most dramatic differences between primary and secondary galaxies in minor mergers .",
    "when considering all pairs ( left column ) we find an increase in sfr for both primary and secondary galaxies ( with the enhancement much more dramatic in primary galaxies ) .",
    "this is once again consistent with the results seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : aaron_class ] , where h@xmath1 derived sfrs show a strong enhancement of sf when considering close- , intermediate- and far - pairs",
    ". however , when we consider just pair galaxies in minor mergers ( right column ) , we see a dramatic change in the sfr with regards to primary / secondary status .",
    "primary galaxies still have their sf strongly enhanced , while secondary galaxies show strong suppression of sf , even at large pair separations ( out to @xmath21r@xmath4390kpc / h).this highlights that sf is suppressed in the secondary galaxies of minor mergers .",
    "as sfr@xmath42 measures sfrs on the shortest timescales , it is likely that the enhancement and suppression seen in primary and secondary galaxies respectively is a direct consequence of the galaxy interactions .",
    "we remind the reader that our h@xmath1 flux measurements are not subject to measurement errors from confusion between close pairs , and as such are not systematically biased by errors in flux distribution .",
    "another possible explanation for the trends seen in h@xmath1 , are that the distribution of star - forming regions within a galaxy changes during the interaction .",
    "the recent simulations of @xcite show that star - formation can be significantly enhanced in the central regions of a galaxy during an interaction , but is largely suppressed in its outer parts . as our h@xmath1 observations only probe the central regions ( due to the aperture - based spectroscopy ) we may only be witnessing centrally concentrated suppression / enhancement of star - formation which is not a true representation of the global affects of the interaction .",
    "however , the trends seen in our h@xmath1 sfrs are consistent with those in our other short - duration sfr indicators , albeit at a higher significance .",
    "further investigation into the spatial distribution of h@xmath1 sf in a subsample of our interacting galaxy sample is underway , and will be the subject of an a upcoming paper .",
    "@xmath33 * global observation * - an interesting additional global observation ( as alluded to previously ) , is that pair galaxies appear to become more suppressed in sf as a function of increasing stellar mass .",
    "this can be seen in all figures in that the lines systematically drop to lower excess ssfr from the top to bottom panels , and suggests that sf in pairs galaxies is not only affected by pair mass ratio and primary / secondary status , but also individual galaxy mass .      in summary , we find that the primary galaxies in both major and minor mergers show consistent trends of enhanced sf over our control sample as a function of decreasing pair separation , and that this enhancement is more pronounced in the short duration sfr indicators of sfr@xmath42 , sfr@xmath44 and sfr@xmath41 .",
    "in contrast , the sf in secondary galaxies shows different characteristics depending on pair mass ratio . in major mergers sf",
    "is enhanced at close pair separations , and follows the primary galaxies , while in minor mergers , we see the converse , that secondary galaxies appear to be suppressed at close pair separations .",
    "this effect is also more pronounced for short timescale sfr indictors .",
    "we find that at large pair separations ( r@xmath4360kpc / h ) pair galaxies look similar in their sfr characteristics and as such , we are likely to be probing these systems prior to significant effects of the interaction . however , we see significant modifications to sfrs at close pair separations , suggesting the effect is due to the interaction .",
    "we also find that the normalisation of the distributions in figures [ fig:100micron ] - [ fig : ha ] marginally drops as a function of stellar mass , which potentially indicates that individual galaxy mass also has an impact on how interactions modify sf .",
    "what is clear from this analysis is that both primary and secondary status within the pair and pair mass ratio play an important role in the modification of sfrs in interactions and we most clearly see the effect of these parameters when measuring sfrs on short timescales .",
    "in this section we take our analysis further and combine the effects of both pair separation and sfr indicator timescale .",
    "we also use this analysis to highlight the key differences between primary and secondary galaxies , and major and minor mergers discussed above .      prior to a more sophisticated analysis , and as alluded to earlier , fig .",

    "galaxies at large pair separations have slightly larger log@xmath35[sfr@xmath46 ] than log@xmath35[sfr@xmath45 ] while at small pair separations , the inverse is true .",
    "this alludes to the fact the sf , as measured by h@xmath1 line emission , is very marginally enhanced over that measured from the fir continuum for close pairs - potentially highlighting that the enhancement of sf occurs on timescales of @xmath40myr .",

    "we once again use the hyperfit package to fit the slope of each pair separation binned distribution and give 1@xmath49 errors . while the distributions in figures [ fig:100micron ] - [ fig : ha ] may not be well fit by a straight line",

    "it is also interesting to note that once again there appears to be a weak trend with stellar mass , however , this is only apparent in secondary galaxies , with secondary galaxies being less enhanced at increasing stellar mass ( the orange points drop from the top to bottom panels ) .",

    "@xmath33 for long timescale sfr indicators , we see little enhancement or suppression of sf in interacting galaxies .",
    "this holds true for both major and minor mergers , and for both primary and secondary galaxies - suggesting that we are probing the sf in the galaxy prior to its sfr being modified by the interaction ( fig .",

    "we relate both our long duration sfr indicators at all separations and our short duration measures at large pair separations to be representative of the pre- , or early - interaction stage .",
    "conversely , our short duration measures at close pair separations is representative of the late - interaction stage .",
    "this simplistic model assumes that galaxies are all on their first approach and that they have not had previous passes , which would effect their star - formation .",
    "such systems could reach relatively large pair separations , but would have already had their star - formation enhanced / suppressed by the interaction . in our analysis we have no method of determining if galaxies have already had one or more passes prior to the observation epoch , as such we can not account for this affect . however , we note that @xcite find that , for the pair sample used in this work , galaxies at @xmath51kpc show much greater signs of visual disturbance than those at @xmath52kpc and both these populations show higher visual disturbance than pairs at @xmath53kpc .",
    "this indicates that galaxies are more strongly affected by interactions at closer separations , and while a fraction of galaxies at large separations my have already had a number of passes , the major trend is that closer separations mean stronger pair interactions and a later stage in the merger process . therefore , we deem it is reasonable to assume that to first order pair separation can be directly related to merger timescale .    using these assumptions we can piece together a hypothetical toy model for sf in the primary and secondary galaxies in both major and minor merger systems .",
    "[ fig : cartoon_model ] displays this hypothetical model with interaction time / pair separation plotted against current sfr .",
    "we also display the timescales over which both long and short duration sfrs are measured , for two different scenarios : t1 , when the galaxies are at large pair separations ( an early stage in their interaction ) and t2 , when the galaxies are at small pair separations ( a late stage in their interaction ) .    in our major merger model",
    "sf remains relatively constant throughout the merger in both the primary galaxy and secondary galaxy , but is enhanced at the very late stages ( we see the strongest enhancement in the shortest timescale indicator - h@xmath1 ) .",
    "these enhancements in sf are likely to be be due to gas turbulence , tidal torques or shocks cause by the gravitational attraction of the other system . in this scenario ,",
    "the secondary galaxy has sufficient mass ( in comparison to the primary ) to retain its gas and continue star - forming at a relatively constant rate @xmath10 it is not tidally stripped .",
    "this is consistent with our observations summarised above .",
    "the primary and secondary galaxies show some enhancement of sf with pair separation , and this increases for the shortest timescale indicator .",
    "if sfrs were measured at t1 and t2 we would observe a marginally increasing measure of both long and short duration sfrs ( the primary and secondary galaxy show similar sf properties which increase in sf for short duration measures ) .",
    "the largest tidal interaction will occur at the smallest pair separation and be most evident in the shortest duration sfr indicator , as such we see the largest enhancement of sf in h@xmath1 derived sfrs .    for our minor merger model",
    ", the primary galaxy follows the same sf evolution as both systems in the major merger .",
    "it is sufficiently high mass in comparison to the secondary to retain its gas and continue star - forming , and has its sfr enhanced over time as interactions with the secondary systems cause gas turbulence and shocks . however",
    ", the secondary system follows a different sf evolution path during the interaction . initially its sf is not significantly altered and hence we do not see distinct differences in long duration sfr measures or a large pair separations , which probe this epoch",
    "however , at some stage during the interaction sf begins to be suppressed .",
    "this is likely through tidal stripping or gas heating .",
    "this is evident as the suppressed sfrs at close pair separations and in short duration sfr indicators .",
    "if we were to measure the sfr of the secondary system at t1 and t2 , we would find that at t1 ( large separation ) , the galaxy would look somewhat like the primary galaxy , and we would see no suppression of sf .",
    "however , at t2 we would find short duration sfrs suppressed relative to t1 , this effect would not yet be observable in the long duration sfr measures . at this point",
    "the secondary galaxy sfrs would be distinctly different from the primary galaxy when observed using short duration indicators - this model is also consistent with the observations summarised above .",
    "if representative of the true galaxy - galaxy interactions , these toy models could potentially explain the contradictory results from previous studies which find both sf enhancement and suppression in close pair systems .",
    "our models predict that sf is enhanced in the majority of cases - where mass ratios are close to 1:1 , as well as in the primary galaxy in a minor merger .",
    "however , sf is suppressed in the secondary galaxy in minor mergers , but only at close pair separations . as such ,",
    "whether sf is enhanced or suppressed in galaxy - galaxy interactions is largely dependent on the pair mass ratio and pair separation . clearly by observing galaxies at different interaction stages and at different pair mass ratios ,",
    "we will will obtain conflicting results as to the suppression / enhancement of sf in interacting systems .",
    "we have investigated star - formation activity as a function of pair separation for interacting galaxies for different merger scenarios , using sfrs derived from multiple sfr indicators covering a range of timescales .",
    "the key results from our analysis are as follows : + @xmath33 sf in interactions proceeds differently for galaxies in minor mergers than in major mergers .",
    "+   + @xmath33 sf in minor mergers proceeds differently in galaxies depending on whether they are the primary ( high mass ) or secondary ( low mass ) galaxy .",

    "+   + @xmath33 secondary galaxies show little change in sf in major mergers , except for some enhancement on the shortest timescales , but are suppressed in minor mergers .",
    "+   + @xmath33 sf suppression in secondary galaxies occurs on timescales of @xmath54myr as it is not evident in long duration sfr measures - as such , it also occurs at a late stage in the interaction .",
    "+ using these results we propose a scenario for the evolution of sf in major and minor merger systems . in the major mergers",
    "both primary and secondary galaxies have their sf marginally enhanced through tidal turbulence and shocks for the early stages . at the later stages of the merger",
    "sf is likely to be enhanced .",
    "sf is not suppressed as both galaxies have sufficient mass ( in relation to the other ) to retain their gas . in the minor mergers",
    "the primary galaxy follows the same sf enhancement as the major merger systems , while the secondary galaxy has its sf suppressed as its gas is either tidally stripped , heated or simply stretched to a lower mean density which is not sufficient for sf .",
    "this toy model is consistent with the recent findings of @xcite and @xcite , as well as the galaxy merger simulation of @xcite - predicting that the effects of galaxy interactions on star - formation are dependant on both pair mass ratio and primary / secondary status within the pair .",
