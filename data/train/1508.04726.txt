    "it is widely accepted that in order to meet the ever - growing demand for data rates in fibre - optic telecommunication systems , the spectral efficiency of the optical fibre transmission system needs to be increased @xcite .",
    "the key physical effects distinguishing a fibre optical system from a free space transmission are : dispersion , nonlinearity and optical noise @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the `` fifth generation '' of optical transceivers and networks operating with coherent detection , advanced multilevel modulation formats , and digital signal processing techniques , has led to the possibility of channel rates exceeding 100 gbit / s @xcite .",
    "the key to this breakthrough is the mitigation of linear transmission impairments , such as chromatic and polarization mode dispersion .",
    "the performance of current coherent systems is limited by noise and nonlinearity .",
    "in contrast to linear channels , however , spectral efficiencies for the optical fibre channel usually exhibit a peak and decay at high input powers ; this is often referred to as the `` nonlinear shannon limit '' @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is caused by the kerr nonlinearity and is believed to ultimately lead to a `` capacity crunch '' @xcite , i.e. , to the inability of the optical network infrastructure to cope with the increasing capacity demand .    the capacity analysis of the nonlinear channel relies on well - established methods of information theory @xcite .",
    "however , most of the analytical results obtained to date concern linear channel models , and hence , are not directly applicable to nonlinear optical channels . despite numerous efforts to define the influence of kerr nonlinearity on the channel capacity @xcite , the capacity of",
    "the nonlinear optical channel still remains as an open research problem .",
    "most of the capacity bounds presented in the literature typically display a peaky behaviour , where the maximum is reached at a finite threshold power . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the first nondecaying ( lower ) bound on the capacity of the nonlinear optical fibre channel ( with zero average dispersion ) was presented in @xcite .",
    "other nondecaying bounds include , e.g. , those given recently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a multitude of different nonlinearity mitigation techniques have been proposed over recent years to suppress nonlinearity - induced distortions .",
    "this includes receiver - based digital signal processing @xcite , digital back - propagation @xcite , optical phase conjugation @xcite , twin - waves phase conjugation @xcite , etc .",
    "however , there are still many limitations and further challenges in applying these methods .",
    "a promising alternative for nonlinearity compensation is the nonlinear fourier transform ( nlft ) developed in the 70 s @xcite .",
    "the applications of the nlft in optical communication originates from the pioneering work of hasegawa and nyu @xcite , an approach that has been extended in a number of recent works @xcite .",
    "notably , an experimental demonstration of a nlft - based transmission was recently presented by blow in @xcite .",
    "the use of nlft for nonlinearity compensation in optical fibre links is possible because the master model governing signal propagation in a single mode optical fibre ( in the absence of noise and loss ) is the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xcite that belongs to the class of _ integrable _",
    "( i.e. , completely solvable ) evolutionary equations @xcite .",
    "the solution method can be considered as the generalisation of the linear fourier transform ( ft ) operation onto the nonlinear ( integrable ) system , hence the name nlft .",
    "similarly to the ft , the nlft decomposes a waveform in the nlse space - time domain into the nonlinear normal modes inside the nonlinear spectral domain @xcite .",
    "the key underlying feature of the nlft transmission is that these nonlinear modes ( nonlinear signal spectrum ) propagate without cross - talk , effectively in a linear manner .",
    "thus , the nonlinear spectrum can be used for encoding and efficient transmission of information over the nonlinear fibre .    the original work by hasegawa and nyu @xcite introduced the concept of `` eigenvalue communications '' , where the information was encoded using discrete eigenvalues associated with the solitonic degrees of freedom emerging from the nlft signal decomposition @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the absence of both loss and noise",
    ", the evolution of nonlinear modes is inherently free from any nonlinear impairments , including a nonlinear cross - talk .",
    "the loss in optical links is usually compensated by using lumped or distributed amplification ; in our case we assume the ideal distributed raman amplification scheme resulting in the lossless nlse @xcite .",
    "however , the signal will still be distorted by amplifier - induced spontaneous emission ( ase ) as well as signal - noise beating .    in this paper ,",
    "we study the channel capacity ( in bits per soliton symbol ) is left for future investigation . ] for a transmission system based on optical solitons ( sufficiently separated in time domain ) launched into a noisy nlse channel .",
    "the information is assumed to be encoded in the soliton s amplitude only , which can be extracted from the imaginary part of the discrete eigenvalue emerging from the nlft signal decomposition .",
    "we consider a discrete - time continuous - input continuous - output channel model , based on the asymptotically exact non - gaussian marginal statistics of the soliton amplitude in the presence of weak ase noise presented in @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that the capacity estimations for such fundamentally nonlinear channels are quite few and far between .",
    "notable exceptions are the works by yousefi and kschischang @xcite and meron et al . @xcite . while in @xcite",
    "the channel statistics were assumed a priori to be gaussian ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "( 27 ) ) , in @xcite a tight lower bound on the channel capacity as a function of the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) was not provided .",
    "the discrete - time channel model governing transmission systems based on optical solitons is a noncentral chi - squared distribution with four degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "based on this model we obtain an asymptotically growing lower bound for the channel capacity vs. snr . this bound is similar to the one in @xcite , where a noisy nonlinear optical fibre channel with zero fibre dispersion was considered .",
    "the results in this paper show that the reachable capacity limits for existing optical fibre channels could have been previously underestimated .",
    "we consider propagation of a slowly varying envelope signal formed by a sequence of solitons transmitted every @xmath0  [ s ] over a nonlinear optical fibre .",
    "our model combines the effects of chromatic dispersion ( we consider the case of anomalous dispersion ) , instantaneous kerr nonlinearity , and ase noise due to optical raman amplification .",
    "the fibre loss is assumed to be continuously compensated along the fibre by means of ideal raman amplification and hence is set to zero @xcite .",
    "the noise - perturbed nlse in dimensionless units is given by @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the time normalised by @xmath0 , @xmath3 is the distance along the fibre normalised by @xmath4 ( not to be confused with the dispersion length ) , and @xmath5 is the group velocity dispersion coefficient .",
