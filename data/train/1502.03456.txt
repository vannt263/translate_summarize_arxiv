    "the priors on these parameters are therefore irrelevant in quoting marginalised constraints on other parameters and we take them extremely wide to explore all possibilities . we impose an upper bound on the @xmath72 prior of @xmath73 , so that the match must occur outside the half - density radius , consistent with the simulation results of @xcite . as already mentioned , the fact that these parameters are unconstrained has physical meaning : our mcmc finds no peak corresponding to an nfw profile , and thus the data prefer soliton cores to nfw cusps .",
    "the central densities are well constrained and so the results are independent of the prior .",
    "we find a one - sided constraint on the axion mass , and so the percentiles quoted depend on the prior for the lower bound .",

    "( [ eqn : empirical_sigma ] ) .",
    "the constraint is caused by requiring a fixed enclosed mass at large radius .",

    "in this paper we have investigated stable solitonic density profiles , which are expected to be the smallest structures formed in models of axion / scalar field dm .",

    "we further explained the soliton size by recourse to the uncertainty principle .",
    "the standard thermodynamic arguments for dust , and the formal equivalence between the schrdinger picture and dust on large scales , further supported by evidence from simulation , lead us to consider solitons as the central cores in nfw halos . we presented a new phenomenological model for such a density profile .",

    "the existence of an upper bound on the dm particle mass in the axion model has a number of interesting consequences .",
    "structure formation in this model is substantially different from cdm due to the cut - off in the power spectrum on small scales caused by the axion sound speed and resulting jeans scale .",

    "cores may be formed by baryonic processes , putting axion dm in the same situation as any other dm model , e.g. wimps .",
    "cores could also be formed by adding strong self - interactions for cdm or for axions .",
    "one could also modify gravity , for example if the modulus partner of the axion played the role of a chameleon field .",
