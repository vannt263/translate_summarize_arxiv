    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , a systematic implementation of chiral symmetry and of its pattern of spontaneous and explicit breaking , provides a model independent scheme where multitude of low - energy non - perturbative strong - interaction phenomena can be understood .",
    "it has been successfully applied to study different processes , both in the meson - meson and in the meson - baryon sectors , involving light ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) or strange ( @xmath17 ) quarks  @xcite .",
    "however , by construction , chpt is only valid at low - energies and it can not describe the nature of hadron resonances . in recent years , it has been shown that by unitarizing the chpt amplitudes one can greatly extend the region of application of chpt .",
    "this approach , commonly referred as unitary chiral perturbation theory ( uchpt ) , has received much attention and provided many interesting results  @xcite .",
    "in particular , many meson - meson and meson - baryon resonances and bound states appear naturally within uchpt .",
    "these states are then interpreted as having `` dynamical nature . '' in other words , they are not genuine @xmath18 or @xmath19 states , but are mainly built out of their meson - meson or meson - baryon components . one way to distinguish these two pictures is to study the dependence on @xmath20 of the resonance masses and widths  @xcite .",
    "some examples are the low - lying scalar mesons , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which naturally appear as resonant states of two mesons of the pion octet  @xcite , or the low - lying @xmath25 baryonic resonances , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are found after unitarizing the chpt amplitudes for the scattering of @xmath30 pseudoscalar octet mesons off baryons belonging to nucleon octet  @xcite , or the low - lying @xmath31 baryonic resonances ( e.g. the @xmath32 ) found in the interaction of mesons of the pion octet with baryons of the @xmath33 decuplet @xcite , and finally the low - lying axial vector mesons , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 that can be described as resonant states of a @xmath30 octet and a @xmath39 vector nonet mesons  @xcite .",
    "these ideas have also been extended to study three - body meson resonances  @xcite and to systems including a heavy quark , which has allowed to describe also meson  @xcite and baryon  @xcite charmed resonances . in these latter cases , of course one can not invoke chiral dynamics to construct the tree level amplitudes that later on will be unitarized .",
    "thus for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite , the universal vector - meson coupling hypothesis is exploited to break the su(4 ) symmetry in a convenient and well - defined manner .",
    "this is done by a @xmath40channel exchange of vector mesons between pseudoscalar mesons and baryons , in such a way that chiral symmetry is preserved in the light meson sector , while the interaction is still of the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) type  @xcite .",
    "a serious limitation of this approach is that it is not consistent with heavy - quark - spin symmetry , which is a proper qcd symmetry that appears when the quark masses become much larger than the typical confinement scale , @xmath41 .",
    "the recent works of refs .",
    "@xcite develop a scheme consistent with both chiral and heavy - quark - spin symmetry by starting from a larger su(8 ) spin - flavor symmetry group , and conveniently breaking the spin ( in the light @xmath42 sector ) and flavor symmetries . in both schemes",
    ", coupled - channel unitarity plays a major role .",
    "coupled - channel unitarity has been also the essential ingredient in other recent works , where the vector meson - vector meson  @xcite and vector meson - octet and decuplet baryon interactions  @xcite in the light sector have been studied . in these cases ,",
    "the formalism of the hidden gauge interaction for vector mesons of @xcite is adopted , and it has led to very successful results from a phenomenological point of view @xcite .    the approach taken in refs .",
    "@xcite , where su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry is invoked , allows to assign the vector mesons of the @xmath39 nonet and the pseudoscalar mesons of the @xmath30 octet in the same ( * 35 * ) su(6 ) multiplet , while the baryons of the nucleon octet and @xmath33 decuplet are placed in the totally symmetric * 56 * su(6 ) representation . the scheme is completely constrained by requiring that its restriction to the @xmath30-@xmath43 octet sector will reduce to the su(3 ) @xmath0wave wt lagrangian , leading order ( lo ) of the chiral expansion in this case .",
    "finally , the su(6 ) symmetry is broken by using physical masses and decay constants .",
    "the corresponding bs amplitudes successfully reproduce the previous su(3)-flavor wt results for the lowest - lying @xmath0and @xmath44wave odd parity baryon resonances obtained from scattering of the mesons of the pion octet off baryons of the nucleon octet and delta decuplet  @xcite .",
    "the extension of the scheme to the charm sector  @xcite naturally accommodates heavy - quark - spin symmetry , as mentioned above , since it encodes spin symmetry in the charm sector , while this is not the case for those models based on vector meson exchanges .    in this work ,",
    "we present the extension of the meson - baryon scheme derived in ref .",
    "@xcite to the meson - meson sector .",
    "the basis of our approach is rooted in the ideas of caldi and pagels @xcite .",
    "these authors identify vector mesons of the nonet as `` dormant '' nambu - goldstone bosons of an extended chiral symmetry su(6)@xmath45su(6)@xmath46 .",
    "this symmetry is intrinsically an approximate one and the vector mesons acquire mass through relativistic corrections .",
    "such scheme naturally solves a number of puzzles involving the nature and classification of vectors mesons and makes predictions in remarkable agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "the low energy theorems derived from partial conservation of the tensor current have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the skyrmion of the su(6)@xmath47su(6)@xmath46 has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the validity of the dormant nambu - goldstone boson description has been verified in the lattice @xcite .",
    "even if , for illustration purposes , su(3 ) flavor symmetry is assumed to be exact and the pseudoscalar mesons are assumed to be massless ( these simplifying assumptions are not essential and can be lifted ) the breaking of su(6 ) down to su(3 ) ( due to the vector mesons masses being nonvanishing ) implies a breaking of su(6)@xmath45su(6)@xmath46 down to su(3)@xmath45su(3)@xmath46 .",
    "one of the contributions of the present work is the construction of suitable lagrangian mass terms achieving such pattern of symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore the approximate spin - flavor symmetry scheme provides a unified framework to deal with lowest lying mesons , implementing the required symmetry breaking patterns and in particular fulfilling low energy theorems derived from chiral symmetry .",
    "in addition , when the present scheme is extended to include heavier quark flavors , the qcd heavy - quark spin symmetry can also be naturally accommodated in the spin - flavor approach through a suitable flavor breaking pattern .",
    "although the predictions so obtained are not so reliable as those derived for pseudoscalar mesons assuming only the standard chiral symmetry breaking pattern of qcd , the fact is that vector mesons do exist and they are known to play a relevant role in hadronic physics .",
    "inescapably , they will interact among themselves and with other pseudoscalar mesons and will certainly influence the properties of the known mesons resonances .",
    "however not so many approaches to deal with vector mesons are available , and the existing ones , e.g. , the hidden gauge approach @xcite are also subject to a certain amount of modeling not directly rooted in qcd .",
    "the theoretically founded models to deal with vector mesons being scarce , we regard the spin - flavor symmetric scenario ( suitably broken ) as a reasonable alternative approach and we believe it makes sense to work out the predictions of such a model .",
    "moreover , we remarkably find that most of the low - lying even parity pdg meson resonances can be classified according to multiplets of the spin - flavor symmetry group su(6 ) .",
    "we will study the @xmath0wave interaction of two members of the * 35 * ( @xmath2octet + @xmath1nonet ) su(6 ) multiplet by means of an enlarged wt meson lagrangian to accommodate vector mesons , which guarantees that chiral symmetry is recovered when interactions between pseudoscalar nambu - goldstone bosons are being examined .",
    "we will pay a special attention to the novel pseudoscalar - vector ( @xmath48 ) and vector - vector ( @xmath49 ) channels , where we will compare our predictions with previous recent results  @xcite obtained within the formalism of the hidden gauge interaction for vector mesons . in the @xmath50 sector ,",
    "chiral symmetry constrains the interactions , and our model and that developed in ref .",
    "@xcite totally agree at lo in the chiral expansion , despite their different apparent structure and origin . as a result of this work ,",
    "we show that most of the low - lying even parity meson resonances , specially in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 sectors , can be classified according to multiplets of the spin - flavor symmetry group su(6 ) .",
    "this can be seen in table  [ tab : j012 ] , which summarizes the set of dynamically generated resonances obtained in this work .",
    "the remaining firmly established positive parity pdg meson states below 2 gev , that can not be accommodated within su(6 ) multiplets , are clear candidates to be glueballs or hybrids .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and some @xmath8 resonances . on the other hand ,",
    "we predict the existence of five exotic resonances ( @xmath9 and/or @xmath10 ) with masses in the region 1.41.6 gev , which would complete the @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 su(3)@xmath14su(2 ) multiplets .",
    "[ tab : j012 ]    ccc @xmath4 & & @xmath51 +    .tentative su(6 ) classification of the poles found in this work , together with their possible pdg counterparts @xcite .",
    "@xmath52 stand for the spin - parity , hypercharge , isospin and @xmath53parity , respectively [ for non - strange states , charge conjugation is given by @xmath54 .",
    "those resonances marked with @xmath55 need to be confirmed , while a ( * ) symbol indicates that the resonance does not appear in the pdg .",
    "finally , a question mark symbol expresses our reservations on the assignment .",
    "mixings between states with the same @xmath56 quantum numbers , but belonging to different su(6 ) and/or su(3 ) multiplets have not been considered . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,<,^ \" , ]     [ tab : final ]",
    "to get the eigenvalues associated to each of the su(6 ) projectors in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hsu6 ] ) and ( [ eq : hsu6s ] ) , we just let act @xmath57 on one of the states of the vector space associated to each representation .",
    "for instance , the vector space associated to the singlet representation is generated by the state @xmath58 this gives @xmath59 and similarly for @xmath60 .",
    "for the remaining symmetric representations , a convenient choice of states is @xmath61 , * 189 * and * 405 * representations , respectively .",
    "the @xmath62wave part @xmath63 can be represented as the matrix element of an operator in a fermion space @xmath64 where now the @xmath65 operators satisfy an anticommutation relation @xmath66 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : wick ] ) still holds .",
    "one can follow the same techniques as those outlined above for the @xmath67 operators , using e.g. the states @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 antisymmetric representations .",
