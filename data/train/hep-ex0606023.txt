    "the pibeta detector system is based on a large acceptance 240-module pure csi electromagnetic shower calorimeter .",
    "the detector includes with an active degrader ad , a segmented active target at , a 20-bar cylindrical plastic scintillator veto pv for particle identification , a pair of tracking cylindrical multi - wire proportional chambers mwpc1/2 and an active cosmic veto shield  @xcite .    a schematic drawing of the detector is shown in fig .  [ fig : det ] .",
    "the incident 114mev / c @xmath6 beam with a minimal @xmath7/@xmath8 contamination was tagged with a thin forward beam counter bc , slowed down in the degrader and ultimately stopped in a tight @xmath9 mm spot in the active target .",
    "the 1999 - 2001 runs , optimized for the pion beta decay measurement , used beam fluxes of up to 1mhz .",
    "beam intensities of 50 - 200@xmath6/s were used in the 2004 for optimal acquisition of radiative decay events .",
    "the recorded data , comprising @xmath10 @xmath6 stops , were obtained by a dedicated two - arm high - threshold trigger as well as 11 physics and calibration triggers , some of which were prescaled .",

    "the standard model ( sm ) description of the @xmath13 decay is theoretically unambiguous within a 0.1% uncertainty  @xcite , but a small @xmath14 branching ratio poses significant experimental chalenges .",
    "the 3.9% uncertainty of the previous most precise measurement , made using the @xmath15 spectrometer at lampf  @xcite , was not accurate enough to test the full extent of radiative corrections which stand at @xmath16%  @xcite .",
    "the fast analog hardware triggers were designed to accept nearly all non - prompt @xmath13 and and a sample of prescaled @xmath17 events with individual shower energy exceeding the michel endpoint ( high threshold @xmath18  52 mev ) .",
    "the data analysis provided clean distributions of 64,047 @xmath13 decay events which agreed very well with energy , angular and timing spectra predicted by the geant3 monte carlo detector simulations .",

    "we have chosen to normalize the @xmath13 yield to the yield of @xmath17 events whose branching ratio is known with 0.33% uncertainty experimentally  @xcite and @xmath20% accuracy theoretically  @xcite . using the pdg  @xcite recommended value of @xmath21",

    "a non - zero value of @xmath28 would imply the non-(@xmath29 ) structure of the electroweak interaction .",

    "our two - dimensional michel parameter fit ( @xmath30 ) of the @xmath31 radiative muon events collected in 2004 ( fig .",

    "the measurement is motivated by the fact that at present accuracy of that branching ratio lags behind the theoretical precision by an order of magnitude .",

    "the yields of @xmath17 and @xmath36 decays that were used for normalization are also internally consistent when compared to the total measured number of decaying @xmath6 s and @xmath8 s  @xcite .",
    "our results confirm the cvc hypothesis in the @xmath6 system at 0.55% level , rule out the tensor contribution in the radiative @xmath6 decay with the form factor @xmath37 ( 90% cl ) , and set the new 90% cl limit on the parameter @xmath32 in the radiative @xmath8 decay .",
