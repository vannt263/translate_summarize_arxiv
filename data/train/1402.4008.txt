    "the quest for realistic magnetic quantum models that support topological and spin liquid ground states is at the frontier of current research in condensed matter and in quantum information science .",
    "these exotic states of matter do not display local order ( i.e. do not break any local symmetry ) , but possess long - range entanglement encoding a global structure that can not be detected by any local measurement .",
    "this absence of local order makes them robust against local perturbations , and thus , promising candidates for technological applications @xcite .",
    "the triangular lattice is the archetype for classical geometric frustration .",
    "this phenomenon is believed to play a crucial role in the stabilization of certain spin liquid quantum phases , such as the resonating valence bond states proposed by anderson @xcite .",
    "such states are not only interesting because of exhibiting this exotic global order , but also they are expected to be related , when doped , to non - conventional superconductivity .    here we analyze the spin-@xmath0 bilinear - biquadratic model in the triangular lattice with uniaxial field .",
    "our study is at least two - fold motivated .",
    "on the one hand , the competition between dipolar and quadrupolar ordering involves a much richer physics than spin-@xmath1 systems , and leads to an effective spin-@xmath1 frustrated model for large values of the anisotropy field .",
    "on the other hand , recent experimental results on some complex crystals where this model might be present show an anomalous behavior which could be related to a spin liquid state @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum systems other than real crystals could simulate this model @xcite .",
    "for instance , ultracold atoms trapped in a triangular optical lattice @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath2 model in a triangular lattice , which has been thoroughly investigated , conclusive results for the @xmath3 in this geometry are scarce , since powerful numerical techniques ( e.g. dmrg , qmc ) can not be easily applied here .",
    "first attempts to describe the full phase diagram of the model have been based on a mean - field ( gutzwiller ) approach , which explicitly assumes a three - sublattice ordering @xcite .",
    "while this approach properly sketches locally ordered phases , it can not describe more complex states as those dominated by inter - site quantum correlations like spin liquids or supersolid phases . in the absence of the anisotropy field , exact diagonalization ( ed ) ( of up to 27 sites )",
    "shows that three - sublattice order is always present , ruling out the existence of a spin liquid @xcite .",
    "however , for a finite value of the anisotropy field , controversial results regarding the presence of spin liquid phases have appeared using variational mc @xcite and mean - field analysis in the triplon fermionic spin representation .    motivated by these controversial results we investigate this model using a cluster mean - field ( cmf ) approach . within this approach ,",
    "the spins in the lattice are grouped into small clusters which are exactly diagonalized , while each cluster is mean - field coupled to the other ones ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) ) @xcite .",
    "this ansatz clearly constitutes a step forward as compared to the gutzwiller mean - field approach since it exactly treats quantum correlations between all sites belonging to the same cluster .",
    "undoubtedly , it also goes beyond the results obtained from the ed of an isolated plaquette of the same size .    before proceeding further with the details of our study ,",
    "we briefly outline here our major findings : ( i ) the cmf provides corrections to the boundaries of the quantum phases obtained with the gutzwiller approach , ( ii ) in stark contrast to the gutzwiller approach , the cmf yields two distinct supersolid ( ss ) phases that for a large easy - axis uniaxial field map onto the supersolid phases present in the spin-@xmath1 xxz model and ( iii ) between the two ss phases we find a region where our results strongly depend on the cluster geometry and size , as well as on the chosen initial cluster configuration .",
    "moreover , as we will discuss in detail later , the presence of these instabilities is crucially linked to the underneath order imposed with the cmf approach .",
    "such instabilities , on the other hand , could be compatible with the presence of a spin liquid , very much in the spirit of the instabilities shown by generalized spin wave theory in anisotropic triangular lattices in spin-@xmath1 systems @xcite .",
    "our cmf approach bounds quite precisely this region as compared to previous results @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model under study together with the cmf method , emphasizing its strength as compared to other approaches . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the results of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model , first reviewing the isotropic model ( iii.a ) and finally in presence of the single - ion anisotropy ( iii.b ) . in sec .",
    "iv we present our conclusions and open questions .",
    "the most general ( n.n . interaction ) rotationally invariant hamiltonian for spin-@xmath0 particles reads : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the usual spin @xmath3 operators and @xmath6 runs over all possible pairs of first neighboring sites of the triangular lattice .",
    "the presence of a uniaxial field breaks the @xmath7 symmetry @xmath8 in the thermodynamic limit the system can display both , dipolar and/or quadrupolar magnetic order , associated to the expectation values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . note that @xmath11 and thus , the quadrupolar vector appears as a meaningful order parameter .",
    "the quadrupolar order is directly related to the anisotropy of spin fluctuations , which can be characterized by the director @xmath12 , that defines the plane onto which the spin maximally fluctuates @xcite .",
    "+ _ the cmf method : _ in the cmf method the lattice is divided into clusters of sites which are exactly diagonalized and coupled via a mean - field approach .",
    "the effective hamiltonian acting on a cluster @xmath13 is then given by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ( exact ) hamiltonian of cluster @xmath13 and @xmath16 is the effective field acting on cluster @xmath13 due to cluster @xmath17 : @xmath18\\ ] ] here the expectation values are evaluated over the self - consistent ground state @xmath19 .",
    "we proceed as follows : starting with a random initial state for each cluster we iteratively solve ( [ cmf ] ) until convergence is achieved .",
    "we use clusters of different geometries and sizes ( @xmath20 3 - 10 sites ) .    ) as a function of reciprocal lattice vector @xmath21 for @xmath22 ( fm phase ) , @xmath23 ( fq phase ) and @xmath24 ( afm phase ) , calculated by ed for a 9 sites cluster .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 points in the first brillouin zone are indicated .",
    ", width=321 ]    there is not a unique way of implementing cmf .",
    "note that with this method , three - sublattice order ( expected to naturally arise in an isotropic triangular lattice if the state is locally ordered ) is not imposed on the final state .",
    "however , by considering different clusters in our ansatz , we give enough freedom to recover such ordering if present .",
    "for example , for a 6-sites cluster , a single configuration for all the plaquettes is sufficient , while for the 7-sites cluster we must use 3 different initial plaquettes to ensure that three - sublattice order can be recovered ( see fig . [ figure1](a ) ) . in this respect ,",
    "our approach differs from the one used in @xcite , where a sublattice background order is first imposed . after choosing the sublattice order , the external field to which the cluster is coupled is calculated by averaging over all sites that belong to the same sublattice .",
    "in addition , one has to average over all the non - equivalent ways of embedding a given cluster geometry in the sublattice structure ( e.g. over the three cluster configurations sketched in fig . [ figure1](a ) ) .",
    "the results obtained with this second approach will be denoted by cmfav .",
    "a major effect of coupling the plaquettes with the others ( which might act as an environment ) is that certain symmetries ( e.g. rotational invariance ) are spontaneously broken , similarly to what happens in the thermodynamic limit . as a consequence ,",
    "the cmf allows for a direct evaluation of the local order parameters @xmath9 or @xmath27 , in sharp contrast to the ed of a single cluster . for the latter ,",
    "one evaluates instead the dipolar and quadrupolar structure factors which take into account spin - spin and quadrupolar - quadrupolar correlations respectively , as done in @xcite for the @xmath28 case .",
    "these are usually defined as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 runs over all sites of the cluster and @xmath31 is the central site .",
    "these functions reveal the order of a phase by showing a maximum at certain value of the momentum @xmath32 . for example",
    ", for ferro- ( antiferro- ) magnetic order this maximum corresponds to the @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) point of the brillouin zone , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) .    with the cmf method ,",
    "a possible way to quantify quantum correlations in our system is through the renormalized linear entropy of a single spin with respect to the rest of the cluster , defined as : @xmath33\\right ) = 1-\\frac{3}{4 } \\left({\\ensuremath{\\langle { \\boldsymbol{s}}_i \\rangle}}^2+{\\ensuremath{\\langle { \\boldsymbol{q}}_i \\rangle}}^2\\right)\\ ] ] being @xmath34 the reduced density matrix of a single spin at site @xmath35 after tracing out the rest of the cluster .",
    "the average of this quantity over all cluster sites and configurations will be denoted by @xmath36 . as it will be shown later",
    ", this parameter properly signals the phase transitions .    on the other hand ,",
    "the gutzwiller ansatz for the triangular lattice is constructed by three independent fields ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) at each of the sublattices @xmath40 . within this approach , and because any quantum correlation between sites is neglected , the local parameters always fulfill @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , and therefore , phases are always locally ordered in one way or another .",
    "this ansatz fails to describe phases without three - sublattice order and/or dominated by quantum correlations .",
    "to test the performance of our cmf approach we start by revisiting the @xmath7 symmetric hamiltonian ( [ hbb ] ) , whose ground state structure has been studied by means of the gutzwiller ansatz @xcite as well as by ed @xcite",
    ". within the cmf approach three - sublattice order is also found at any value of the parameter @xmath43 . in particular ,",
    "four phases with local magnetic order emerge : _ ferro - magnetic order _",
    "( fm ) for @xmath44 , _ ferro - quadrupolar order _ ( fq ) for @xmath45 , _ antiferro - magnetic order _ ( afm ) for @xmath46 , and _ antiferro - quadrupolar order _ ( afq ) for @xmath47 .",

    "a convenient way to characterize these three - sublattice locally ordered phases is by the following order parameter : @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the phase , @xmath35 runs over all lattice sites of the cluster and @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 ) denote the three sublattices .",

    "these order parameters are shown in fig . [",
    "figure2](a ) for several cluster sizes .",
    "the gutzwiller ansatz already yields the correct phases and for all but the fq - afm transition the phase boundaries coincide with those obtained by ed . for the latter ( for clusters of 9 sites and larger )",
    "this yields @xmath64 ( see fig . [ figure2](b ) and also @xcite ) , whereas with the gutzwiller ansatz the transition occurs at @xmath65 .",
    "the inclusion of correlations in the cmf approach yields a critical point that shifts to smaller values in modulus as the cluster size increases . with our available cluster sizes ,",
    "we perform a linear fit as in @xcite on the value @xmath66 as a function of the parameter @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the number of quantum - mechanical bonds in the cluster and coordinate number respectively ( @xmath70 for gutzwiller and @xmath71 in the thermodynamic limit ) .",

    "the presence of a uniaxial anisotropy field along an arbitrary axis , e.g. @xmath74-axis , drastically changes the nature of the ground state .",
    "when the anisotropy does not dominate over the exchange coupling the system is far from being well understood .",

[ figure3 ] .",

    "it is easy to see that magnetization along the @xmath74-direction in the @xmath2 model directly maps into dipolar order along the same axis for @xmath3 , whereas the transverse magnetization maps into quadrupolar order for the latter .",

    "the gutzwiller ansatz fails , because the hamiltonian is reduced to the classical xxz model , which exhibits phases with qualitatively different local order and even non - trivial macroscopic degeneracies that are broken in the quantum model .",
    "indeed , already at a finite value of the easy - axis anisotropy field the local @xmath78 component is completely suppressed , and thus , the model reduces to the spin-@xmath1 xxz model , exactly as in the @xmath121 limit .",
    "furthermore , within the mean - field ansatz this model is equivalent to the classical one .",
    "in contrast , the cmf yields two phases that possess magnetic and quadrupolar order coexisting and which continuously connect with the mapped supersolid phases ( ss1 and ss2 ) expected for the effective spin-@xmath1 xxz model in the large easy - axis anisotropy limit ( @xmath122 ) . notice that in the triangular lattice the two ss - phases can not be mapped onto each other ( @xmath123 ) .",

    "<S> we study the spin-@xmath0 model in a triangular lattice in presence of a uniaxial anisotropy field using a cluster mean - field approach ( cmf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between antiferromagnetic exchange , lattice geometry and anisotropy forces gutzwiller mean - field approaches to fail in a certain region of the phase diagram . there , the cmf yields two supersolid ( ss ) phases compatible with those present in the spin-@xmath1 xxz model onto which the spin-@xmath0 system maps . between these two ss phases , the three - sublattice order is broken and the results of the cmf depend heavily on the geometry and size of the cluster . </S>",
