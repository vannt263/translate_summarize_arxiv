    "they share some structural properties of scale - invariant mera states ( including the possibility of constructing efficient optimizing algorithms  @xcite ) but admit a simpler description and provide a prototypical realization of a real - space renormalization process . even though on general grounds it can be argued that these states are suitable candidates to approximate critical systems ( e.g. they violate area law  @xcite with logarithmic corrections  @xcite ) an explicit derivation of their critical properties is still missing .",
    "we will prove that hbtss can describe critical systems by computing the correlation functions and show that they decay in a power - law fashion .",
    "once ascertained that hbtss do describe critical ground state it would be important to know if there are cases in which they are actually the exact ground state of a given model hamiltonian . despite the large body of work devoted so far on the subject there is no definite answer for critical systems ( up to now only approximated , numerical evidences have been gathered on this issue ) . given their ubiquitous presence of in condensed matter and statistical mechanics , this question is of particular relevance both conceptually and for possible numerical implementations . in this work",

    "then we show how the analysis can be extended to the case of finite dimensional hbtss .",
    "consider a hamiltonian which involves at most @xmath97-neighboring couplings of the form @xmath98 the factor @xmath99 is introduced to keep a finite spectrum in the thermodynamical limit , and where @xmath100 is an interaction term that couples @xmath49 consecutive sites starting from the @xmath30-th ( i.e. the sites @xmath101 ) .",

    "let us for a moment assume that the rank of @xmath61 is less than its maximum @xmath103 .",
    "this means that such density matrix has a nontrivial kernel , which can be decomposed in a basis of vectors @xmath104",
    ". therefore we take @xmath105 with @xmath106 being arbitrary positive constants .",
    "this is positive by construction , and so is the associated @xmath107 .",
    "then , since the image of @xmath108 belongs to the kernel of @xmath61 , it is clear that @xmath109 , and so @xmath110 as well . in the end , we built a positive , translation invariant , hamiltonian , with @xmath97-neighboring coupling terms , whose expectation value over our hbts is zero ; this means that the state is a ground state for @xmath107 .",
    "the only caveat to make it work is to demonstrate that , for some @xmath49 we have @xmath111 ( otherwise @xmath108 would be the trivial null operator ) .",
    "the fundamental ingredient to verify this is to notice that the channel @xmath53 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fff ] ) preserves rank while increasing dimensions ( i.e. it is an isometric mapping ) .",
    "let thus investigate the case @xmath63 .",
    "we know that the state @xmath112 is obtained by exploiting the first of the mapping of eq .  .",
    "specifically we have @xmath113 with @xmath114 being the single site identity mapping and with @xmath115 and @xmath116 some @xmath117 positive matrices .",
    "the maps @xmath118 and @xmath119 preserve the rank , and the rank of the sum is less or equal than the sum of ranks , thus leading us to the inequality @xmath120 over a maximum of @xmath121 .",
    "therefore if the local dimension @xmath5 is 3 ( spin 1 ) or greater then we already achieved our goal of finding a @xmath61 matrix with non - maximal rank .    for @xmath122 ( spin 1/2 ) instead we have to move to @xmath123 . in this case the state to consider is @xmath124 since its rank obeys the inequality @xmath125 we have found a state that already for @xmath126 possess a nontrivial kernel ( indeed in this case @xmath127 which is strictly minor than the total dimension @xmath128 ) .    in summary",
    "this shows that any given infinite hbts admits always a local translationally invariant non - trivial parent hamiltonian @xmath129 , which can be constructed explicitly as in eq .",
    "( [ ddd ] ) . for @xmath130 such @xmath129 can be chosen to have interactions which involve up to second neighboring couplings . for @xmath122 instead",
    "we can always choose @xmath129 with up to third neighboring couplings .",
    "our analysis deals with the worst case scenario , if it occurs that @xmath131 is non full rank by accident , one can construct a shorter - ranged ( i.e. nearest neoughbours ) parent hamiltonian using  ( [ ddd ] ) .",
    "the above approach formally applies to the case of infinitely many sites , and in general there is no guarantee that the selected @xmath129 will be a parent hamiltonian of the hbts @xmath11 when @xmath10 is finite .",
    "nonetheless the proof can be extend to cover also this case in most situations .",
    "this will allow us to prove that for @xmath132 even , @xmath129 is unfrustrated and that its ground space must have dimension @xmath133 larger than @xmath134 .    to show this we focus on the case @xmath130 and assume that our hbts has @xmath135 of full rank ( generalization to @xmath122 shall be dealt later ) ; this guarantees that eq .",
    "( [ ddd ] ) provides a parent hamiltonian @xmath129 for the thermodynamical state with a three - body interaction @xmath136 .",
    "consider then a generic state @xmath137 of @xmath138 sites and `` grow '' a bt level from it , using the same @xmath0 isometry we used to build @xmath129 .",
    "this way we obtain a @xmath132-sited state latexmath:[\\ ] ]    where the first identity simply states that @xmath129 is the parent hamiltonian of the hbts at thermodynamical limit . since @xmath135 has maximal support by hypothesis and @xmath153 is positive semidefinite by construction , eq .",
    "( [ proofv ] ) implies @xmath154 .",
    "equation   then leads to @xmath155 which , together with the positivity of @xmath129 , tells us that each one of the vectors @xmath144 of the subspace @xmath140 is a ground state of the parent hamiltonian @xmath129 .",
    "let us now deal briefly with the case @xmath122 .",
    "if @xmath156 is nonfull rank then we can build a three - body interacting parent hamiltonian just like the @xmath157 case , and the generalization to the finite setting is identical .",
    "otherwise , via @xmath158 we can build a positive parent hamiltonian @xmath129 of the thermodynamical state with four - body interactions @xmath159 .",
    "evaluating its expectation value on the @xmath132-sited state  ( [ statophi ] ) it is then easy to verify that it nullify ( the proof is similar to the previous case , and it exploits the fact that @xmath156 has full rank ) .",
    "the above discussion proves that for all even @xmath132 , the hamiltonian @xmath129 ( resp .",
    "@xmath160 ) has a ground eigen - space which is at least @xmath134 dimensional  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a wide ground state degeneracy is in accordance with symmetry predictions : since a finite hbt state @xmath137 breaks the translational symmetry at every lenghtscale , the whole space generated by @xmath161 must be embedded within the ground space .",
    "the present argument also implies that @xmath129 represents an unfrustrated system .",
    "indeed if @xmath162 then each local component of @xmath129 needs to nullify on @xmath144 , i.e. @xmath163 @xmath164 . as an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : spettro ] we report the eigenvalues degeneracies for a parent hamiltonian @xmath129 generated from an isometry @xmath0 defined by the following mapping @xmath165 ( here @xmath122 while @xmath129 was generated by taking the free - parameters @xmath106 of eq .",

    "we also checked numerically the case of @xmath132 odd ( for which the previous theoretical analysis does not hold ) : in this case the ground state energy is not null showing that @xmath129 is frustrated and that its degeneracy is way smaller than @xmath134 , and controllable by choosing the @xmath106 parameters appropriately .",
    "this procedure to construct a parent hamiltonian for a binary tree can also be applied to other tensor structures . in the appendix",
    "we discuss the case of a mera .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the potential of binary trees to simulate efficiently quantum critical systems .",
    "previous works  @xcite presented evidences that such states could yield violation of the area law with logarithmic corrections . in this paper we focused on homogenous configurations which allow for an explicit analytic treatment of the thermodynamical limit .",
    "their hierarchical , scale invariant structure suggest that they should be capable of exhibit critical behaviors , at least once a proper averaging over translations has been performed to compensate for their explicit lack of translational invariance  @xcite .",
    "for instance by looking at their tensorial decomposition it is clear that hbts do not violate the area law for all possible partitions of the sites ( e.g. since the left side of the graph is connected with the right side by only a single link , the resulting block entropy will be independent from the number of sites ) .",
    "it is reasonable to belief that such `` anomalies '' however will wash away when averaging over all possible translations ( a legitimate operation when simulating translationally invariant systems ) . in the case of the block entropy",
    "this can be heuristically verified by noticing that indeed the average number of tensor links that needs to be cut in order to disconnect the causal cone of a block of consecutive sites from the rest , scales almost logarithmically with the block size . to test the validity of these arguments , in our paper we focused on the behavior of two - point correlation functions in the thermodynamical limit of infinitely many sites .",
    "once averaged over all possible translations , we proven that these quantities can be explicitly computed and showed that they decay as power law in agreement with the criticality character of hbts .    in the second part of the paper",
    "we have then shown that hbts are the exact ground states of short - range interacting hamiltonians .",
    "in particular we gave a procedure to built such parent hamiltonian .",
    "in the case we analyzed the ground state has a degeneracy which scales with the square root of the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "similar results can be obtained ( see the appendix ) also for mera states .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with g. e. santoro and financial support from ip - eurosqip , firb - rbid08b3fm , sfb / trr 21 , and the national research foundation and ministry of education singapore .",
    "in this appendix we discuss how to generalize the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : par ] to the case of scale - invariant ( i.e. homogeneous ) mera states  @xcite . indeed also for a mera it is possible to establish upper bounds for the rank of the states @xmath61 ( the translationally averaged @xmath49 neighbouring sites density matrix in the thermodynamical limit ) by exploiting growth superoperators properties , for varous block sizes @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , by finding the suitable ( smallest ) @xmath49 for which such rank is not maximal , the construction of a parent hamiltonian interaction term according to equation is straightforward .",
    "+ precisely , such minimal parent interaction lenght @xmath49 depends on the topology of the original mera  @xcite and its local dimension @xmath5 . for a binary mera structure , we find that @xmath169 whose value is not maximal for @xmath157 ; for completeness @xmath170 takes care of the case @xmath126 ; thus is always possible to build a parent hamiltonian with a 5 or 6 bodies interaction .",
