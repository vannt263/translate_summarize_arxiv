    "most discussions of thermal equilibrium of such systems using field theory employ a grand canonical ensemble , where the number of particles can fluctuate .",
    "we turn to this later in the paper , but mainly consider the canonical ensemble , where the number of particles is fixed .",
    "the relevant subspace @xmath9 of @xmath10 particles is identified by the identity operator acting over that subspace , @xmath11 where @xmath12 indicates the vacuum state with no particles ; this expression is valid for either fermions or bosons .",
    "the density operator for a canonical ensemble involving @xmath10 particles can then be constructed by replacing the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) in the usual boltzmann factor @xmath13 by its projection onto @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath14 . since the full hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) does not change the number of particles , it commutes with @xmath15 , and we can write the density operator for a canonical ensemble of @xmath10 particles at temperature @xmath16 in a particular form that will prove convenient , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the partition function for @xmath10 particles , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant ; the expression @xmath21 $ ] follows from the nomalization condition @xmath22=1.$ ]    a starting point for our work below will be the density operator for a single particle , @xmath23 .",
    "the usual convex decomposition is obtained from the equations above by expanding the field operator in terms of the energy eigenstates , @xmath24 where @xmath25_{\\pm}=\\delta_{nn'}$ ] and @xmath26 using ( [ eq : normal - modes ] ) in ( [ eq : identity ] ) for @xmath27 and putting that result in ( [ eq : rhoth_def ] ) , we find the usual result , @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . instead of actually constructing the wave functions @xmath32 and",
    "their energies @xmath33 for a particular potential @xmath1 , often one assumes that the potential @xmath1 vanishes within a very large cubical box of volume @xmath34 and is essentially infinite outside it , confining the particle to the box ; further , instead of using the standing wave solutions of the resulting hamiltonian , in place of @xmath32 one simply takes plane waves , @xmath35 , satisfying periodic boundary conditions by requiring @xmath36 for each cartesian component of @xmath37 , where the @xmath38 are integers @xcite .",
    "then @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and in the limit @xmath41 the standard result is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the thermal debroglie wavelength .",
    "this is a good approximation for @xmath44 ; we present a new argument for this below , and show how corrections to this limit could be included if desired . but note that whether the @xmath32 satisfying ( [ eq : eigenvalues ] ) are adopted , or plane waves used in their stead , the wave functions associated with the states appearing in the convex decomposition ( [ eq : rho_conv ] ) are delocalized throughout the entire box confining the particles  as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch](b ) .",
    "in contrast , we now introduce a strategy for rewriting @xmath45 that for @xmath46 will lead to a convex decomposition of @xmath23 in terms of wave packets , rather than completely delocalized wave functions as in ( [ eq : rho_conv ] ) , and for arbitrary @xmath10 will lead to a convex decomposition of @xmath45 in terms of sets of wave packets .",
    "the strategy is based on finding an operator @xmath47 such that @xmath48 once this is identified , we can `` pull through '' the factors @xmath49 appearing in the expression ( [ eq : rhoth_def ] ) for the density operator of the canonical ensemble until they act on the vacuum , which then simply yields the vacuum state itself .",
    "the result is @xmath50 a convex decomposition involving states that we shall see are @xmath10-particle wave packets identified by @xmath51 .    to determine @xmath47 we introduce @xmath52 ; then @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "this is a typical diffusion equation , and with the initial condition at @xmath56 , @xmath53 , there are two special cases of interest : ( a ) if @xmath1 is neglected we find the solution @xmath57 with @xmath58 where again @xmath59 is the thermal debroglie wavelength associated with @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ; ( b ) if @xmath1 is large and positive we have @xmath62 as @xmath63 . recalling from ( [ eq : th - general ] ) that @xmath64 , we see from ( b ) that if any of the @xmath65 lie far outside the nominal confining box , where @xmath1 is large and positive , the contribution from @xmath66 can be neglected . and since from ( [ eq : g ] ) we see that @xmath67 is non - negligible for @xmath68 less than or on the order of @xmath59 , we can surmise from ( [ eq : sol_diff ] ) that the effect of @xmath69 can be described by ( [ eq : sol_diff ] ) as long as @xmath65 is within a few @xmath59 of any edge of the nominal box and inside it .",
    "combining these two results , if the volume @xmath70 of the nominal box satisfies @xmath71 , we make a negligible error restricting the integrals in ( [ eq : th - general ] ) to the volume of the nominal confining box , then we have the equivalent expressions @xmath72 and for all such points @xmath73 within that volume , we use the result ( [ eq : sol_diff ] ) for @xmath74 @xmath75 corrections to ( [ eq : rho_v ] , [ eq : o_sol ] ) will be important as the confining volume shrinks to a size on the order of the thermal debroglie wavelength , and indeed the approach we are developing here would be an interesting way to explore such `` finite size '' effects .",
    "one would simply replace ( [ eq : rho_v ] ) by the more correct ( [ eq : th - general ] ) , and instead of using ( [ eq : g ] ) for the green function use the exact solution of ( [ eq : diff ] ) .",
    "but we defer such explorations to later communications , and here restrict ourselves to the use of ( [ eq : rho_v ] , [ eq : o_sol ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the function @xmath76 @xmath77 which satisfies @xmath78 then within our approximations ( [ eq : rho_v ] , [ eq : o_sol ] ) we can write ( [ eq : o_def ] ) as @xmath79 for any @xmath73 within the volume @xmath70 . letting ( [ eq : rule ] ) act on any state @xmath80 , multiplying by the adjoint and integrating over all @xmath73 within the volume @xmath70 , we have    @xmath81    which is the central result of this section .",
    "we now return to the example of a single particle , and use ( [ eq : pullthrough ] ) to write the expression for @xmath23 that follows from ( [ eq : rho_v ] ) as @xmath82 where we have defined the single particle state @xmath83 since the single particle states @xmath84 are normalized , @xmath85 , the condition @xmath86=1 $ ] implies that @xmath87 comparison with ( [ eq : rho1_local1 ] ) leads immediately to the result @xmath88 , as would be expected within our approximations .",
    "each single - particle state @xmath84 has a coordinate representation @xmath89 , which is a minimum uncertainty wave packet centered at @xmath73 and extending about a distance @xmath59 from @xmath73 in all directions .",
    "in particular , for each of these states @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . note that the expectation value of the momentum in each wave packet @xmath92 vanishes , but @xmath93 that is , in ( [ eq : rho1_local ] ) we have the density operator written as a mixture of localized wave packets , distributed in their mean positions over the box containing the particle , but the expectation value of the momentum of each wave packet vanishes , and the thermal energy is completely contained in the width of the wave packet .",
    "a convex decomposition more in line with the classical picture of thermal equilibrium would involve localized wave packets with expectation values of momentum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch]c ) , but averaged over all possible momenta with an appropriate probability distribution such that the average momentum of course vanishes .    following a strategy introduced earlier @xcite",
    ", we can move to such a convex decomposition by noting that when ( [ eq : wpn1_static ] ) is substituted into ( [ eq : rho1_local ] ) , terms such as @xmath94 appear , which are then to be integrated over @xmath73 .",
    "that integral extends over the volume @xmath70 of the box , but for the @xmath95 and @xmath96 of importance , it can be extended over infinity without serious error , within our usual assumption of @xmath97 .",
    "so for the @xmath95 and @xmath96 of importance we can write @xmath98 in the second strict equality we have introduced a normalized momentum distribution function , @xmath99 with @xmath100 , and a set of normalized wave functions , @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",

    "@xmath107 respectively , through the relation of a thermal debroglie wavelength to temperature , this condition requires @xmath108 .",
    "we comment on the physical significance of @xmath103 and @xmath104 below , but we note that for @xmath95 and @xmath96 of importance the last approximate result of ( [ eq : trick ] ) follows if @xmath103 is not too small , and that last result can then be applied for all @xmath95 and @xmath96 within our usual assumption that @xmath71 . finally , inserting ( [ eq : wpn1_static ] ) in ( [ eq : rho1_local ] ) and using ( [ eq : trick ] ) , we find an alternate convex decomposition of @xmath23 , @xmath109 in terms of single particle states @xmath110 these are again minimum uncertainty states , but each has an expectation value @xmath111 of momentum , and @xmath112 , and @xmath113",
    ". that is , these wave packets are broader than those introduced in ( [ eq : rho1_local ] ) .",
    "so instead of ( [ eq : dp_tot ] ) , for these wave packets we have @xmath114 that is , part of the thermal energy resides in the motion of the wave packets , and part of it resides in their width .    for the purpose of illustration ,",
    "consider argon atoms at room temperature ( @xmath115 ) @xcite . in the convex decomposition ( [ eq : rho1_local ] ) involving the most localized wave packets ,",
    "the wave packet fwhm is @xmath116 . even in a convex decomposition ( [ eq : rho1_gen ] )",
    "that would involve wave packets with only @xmath117 of the kinetic energy residing in the width of the wave packets ( @xmath118 and the remaining @xmath119 in the mean velocities of the wave packets , the wave packet fwhm would be only @xmath120 , which would be on the order of the diameter of the outermost orbital of the argon electrons ( @xmath121 thus the construction of a convex decomposition of the form ( [ eq : rho1_gen ] ) involving classical - like motion of wave packets is certainly possible in the classical regime , as one would expect physically .",
    "the generalization to a canonical ensemble of @xmath10 particles follows immediately , applying ( [ eq : rule ] ) to ( [ eq : rho_v ] ) @xmath10 times , `` pulling through '' @xmath122 until it acts on the vacuum state .",
    "we find @xmath123 involving @xmath10-particle states with localized wave packets , @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 label the expectation values of the positions and momenta of the wave packets , respectively .",
    "while the thermal state density matrix has unit trace , @xmath127=1 $ ] , the individual states ( [ eq : wpn_dynamic ] ) are not normalized , and their norm encompass all features distinguishing fermionic from bosonic statistics .",
    "this becomes obvious when we use the unit trace condition to identify the partition function , @xmath128 the factor @xmath129 is the standard gibbs factor @xcite that corrects the naive classical expression @xmath130 for the indistinguishability of the particles , and their product is the usual result in the maxwell - boltzmann limit .",
    "the remaining integral encapsulates the differences in the sum over states between bosonic and fermionic systems .",
    "we now present some illustrations of our results . we begin with the partition function for a system of @xmath131 particles .",
    "of course , we recover the usual expression for the partition function @xmath132 which shows the quantum correction to the classical partition function ( _ cf .",
    "_ second term on the r.h.s . ) .",
    "this recovers the results from huang @xcite : the symmetric properties of the 2-particle wave function can be effectively accounted for with an attractive ( repulsive ) ` statistical potential ' for bosons ( fermions ) .",
    "note that this term vanishes in the maxwell - boltzmann limit ( @xmath133 ) , such that we recover the classical result .",
    "also , the states are not normalized and their norm depends on the nature of the particles : @xmath134 in fig .",
    "( [ fig : coordn2 ] ) , we illustrate the coordinate representation of the 2-particle wave packet ,    @xmath135    that is symmetric under exchange of coordinates for bosons , and anti - symmetric for fermions . if the density is low enough that for most @xmath136 and @xmath137 the wave packets appearing in the coordinate representation of the kets ( and bras ) in the convex decomposition ( [ eq : rhoth_nwp ] ) of @xmath138 do not overlap , then to a good approximation the coordinate representations of the outer products of the kets and bras arising in ( [ eq : rhoth_nwp ] ) can be reorganized into terms involving simple products of two wave packets , as would be expected in the maxwell - boltzmann limit of distinguishable particles .",
    "this scenario generalizes to @xmath139 .",
    "we now turn to correlations functions , which often enter in calculations involving thermal states .",
    "the @xmath140 order correlation function for an @xmath10-particle thermal state is defined as    @xmath141,\\ ] ]    where @xmath142 is the heisenberg representation of the creation operator .",
    "since our convex decomposition ( [ eq : rho1_gen ] ) involves localized wave packets , the correlation functions can be written as integrals over correlation functions associated with states consisting of sets of wave packets .",
    "consider first a single - particle system . from ( [ eq : rho1_gen ] ) , we find that the first - order correlation function can be written as @xmath143 where the correlation function associated with the state @xmath144 is given by @xmath145 we then find that the correlation function ( [ eq : gth_1wp ] ) can be written as @xmath146 where we have introduced the function @xmath147 with @xmath148",
    "[ fig : g1n1]a illustrates the first - order correlation function ( [ eq : g1n1 ] ) for static wave packets ( zero average momentum ) , while fig .",
    "[ fig : g1n1]b shows the result for dynamic wave packets",
    ".        since the individual expectation values ( [ eq : gth_1wp ] ) involve a single wave packet , the wave packet contributions ( [ eq : g1n1 ] ) are products of functions of @xmath149 and @xmath150 , but the integral ( [ eq : gth_1wp ] ) over all these contributions gives a correlation function @xmath151 that depends only on @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : g1n1]c ) .",
    "we now turn to a system with @xmath131 particles . if we consider the first order correlation function we will find contributions from each state in ( [ eq : rhoth_nwp ] ) , with each contribution arising from a first order correlation function of a state with two wave packets . here",
    "the nature of the particles will appear explicitly .",
    "for example , if we consider a state involving two wave packets with no average momentum , @xmath154 , we find    @xmath155    where note that the contribution involves a single - particle term from each wave packet , plus quantum corrections that appear for overlapping wave - functions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : g1n2 ] ) . in the maxwell - boltzmann limit",
    "the contribution from these correction terms will become negligible , as indeed they will be for an @xmath10 particle system , and the first order correlation function then reduces to the contributions from the individual wave packets , @xmath156    ) for the 2-particle states for ( a ) fermionic and ( b ) bosonic particles .",
    "we clearly see the consequence of pauli exclusion principle and the anti - bunching character of fermions , leading to a zero correlation function for overlapping wave packets ( @xmath157 ) . in opposition",
    ", the bosons ( b ) present an enhanced correlation function due to their bunching character . for non - overlapping wave functions ( @xmath158 ) , both fermionic and bosonic systems exhibit the same properties and we recover the maxwell - boltzmann limit , i.e. a profile similar to fig .",

    "all vectors are taken along the same direction .",
    "[ fig : g1n2],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in a previous communication @xcite we demonstrated the impossibility of describing the state of thermal light using a normalized mixture of _ single _ pulses .",
    "the first order correlation function , however , could be obtained from that of the normalized mixture by multiplying it by a product of the confining volume and the density of photons .",
    "that result has an analog here , for the first order correlation function of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( [ eq : gn_mb ] ) can be obtained by multiplying the first order correlation function of a single particle ( [ eq : g1thn1 ] ) by the product of the confining volume @xmath70 and the density of particles @xmath159 . in our work on photons",
    "@xcite we also found that higher order correlation functions could not be described by a mixture of _ single _ pulses , even if improperly normalized .",
    "that holds for nonrelativistic particles as well , and is even more clearly true . to reproduce second - order correlation functions in an @xmath10 particle system",
    ", one would need a ( improperly normalized ) mixture of at least two - particle states .",
    "even if it were improperly normalized , no mixture of single particle states would lead to a nonvanishing @xmath160 .",
    "we point out that the convex decompositions of thermal equilibrium we have presented here can be used to generate even more decompositions .",
    "since the density operator commutes with the hamiltonian , we clearly have @xmath161 .",
    "taking @xmath162 to be the free particle hamiltonian , forming @xmath163 from ( [ eq : rhoth_nwp ] ) it is clear that the many - particle wave functions associated with the kets @xmath164 will involve superpositions of products of wave packets that have spread from their initial minimum uncertainty states to states with broader widths , for either @xmath165 positive or negative ; for @xmath166 not too large the use of the free particle hamiltonian will not introduce significant error in our limit @xmath71 of interest .",
    "thus the decompositions we have detailed up until this point , which have all involved minimum uncertainty wave packets , are only a small subset of those possible .",
    "we also note that the approach developed here extends immediately to the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the density operator for that ensemble is given by @xmath167},\\ ] ] where @xmath168 is the chemical potential and @xmath169 the number operator .",
    "in the usual way this can be written as @xmath170}\\rho_{\\rm th}^{(n)},\\ ] ] where we take @xmath45 to be given in the form ( 2 ) .",
    "then convex decompositions for all the @xmath45 can be constructed as we have discussed , and a convex decomposition for @xmath171 involving sets of wave packets with different numbers in different subsets can be constructed .    in conclusion , we have constructed new convex decompositions of the density operator for nonrelativistic , non - interacting particles in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the many - particle wave functions associated with the kets in the decompositions involve sets of wave packets , in general with a range of average positions and momenta .",
