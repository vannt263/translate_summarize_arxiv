    "ferromagnetism in diluted iii - v semiconductors has recently attracted considerable attention for technologically appealing possibility of integration of spin degrees of freedom into semiconductor devices . in the most intensively studied compound of this group",

    "the transition metal impurities in these materials substitute for the atoms of the iii group and act as both localized spins ( @xmath4 for mn due to half - filled @xmath5-shell ) and as acceptors doping the system with one hole .",
    "however , the system is highly compensated presumably owing to double donor antisites ( v group elements substituted for iii group elements ) and metastable interstitial transition metal impurities .",
    "a major not fully resolved issue is the mechanism governing ferromagnetism in these compounds . despite high disorder in these non - equilibrium",
    "epitaxially grown films , rkky interaction seems to be the most plausible cause of mn spin - spin interaction @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , we want to indicate that magnetic interactions in semiconductors are not well understood yet even in a much simpler case of electrons localized on non - magnetic impurities .",
    "whereas two hydrogen atoms at large distances are known to interact antiferromagnetically , the sign of the interaction between donors / acceptors is not obvious because of the band degeneracies as well as strong spin - orbital interaction present .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "exchange interaction between donors was considered only in ref .",
    "@xcite in the heitler - london approximation which is known to be incorrect at large separations@xcite . besides , in ref .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is to obtain _ asymptotically exact _",
    "formulas for the exchange interaction between two shallow centers at large separations .",
    "although our results are pertinent to low impurity concentrations , this information would be necessary for interpolating results of numerical calculations to shorter inter - impurity separations  higher impurity concentrations .",
    "the heitler - london scheme , which considers exchange with the alien atom as perturbation , is inapplicable @xcite to electron exchange at large separations * @xmath6 * , because the tunneling takes place through a region where interactions with both atomic residues and between the electrons themselves are comparable . as a matter of fact , the heitler - london expression for the exchange between two hydrogen atoms incorrectly changes sign at large inter - atom separations .",
    "the correct approach to the asymptotic exchange , that accurately accounted for the interaction between the electrons and ionic residues during the exchange process , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the exchange was expressed as an integral of the probability current over the 5-dimensional median hyperplane separating two regions of electron localization in their 6-dimensional coordinate space .    before proceeding to the corresponding problem in semiconductors we list a number of extensions of the method @xcite to other problems in atomic physics . in @xcite",
    "a generalization was made for two atoms with non - equal binding energies of electrons in @xmath7-states .",
    "it turned out , however , that in order for the method to be applicable , the two energies should be close , which severely restricted the applicable range of @xmath6 ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite exchange integrals between degenerate @xmath7- and @xmath8- states have been calculated starting from wigner - witmer classification of the molecular states ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite was applied to get interpolated formulas down to small @xmath6 and to study two - dimensional electrons localized on out - of - plane impurities .",
    "but to the best of our knowledge , multiple degeneracy of donor or acceptor levels in real semiconductors has never been addressed .    in this paper",
    "we extend the median - plane method to asymptotic exchange between shallow impurities in semiconductors with localized carriers in degenerate and non - spherically symmetric bands .",
    "we also study how spin - orbital interaction and external magnetic field influence the exchange .    as is well known , the basis of description of shallow impurity centers in semiconductors is the effective mass method @xcite .",
    "shallow ceneters have small ionization energy compared to the forbidden gap , and , consequently , the localization scale much larger than the lattice constant .",
    "hence for shallow centers the potential binding carriers to the oppositely charged impurity ion may be deemed of approximately coulomb form : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the permittivity . following standard kohn - luttinger formalism @xcite , the wave function",
    "may then be expanded in many - electron bloch functions @xmath12 at the extremum of the free band@xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the band degeneracy at the extremum , and the envelope function @xmath16 satisfies a schrdinger equation@xmath17 with the effective mass tensor @xmath18 determined by the crystal symmetry .",
    "we have generalized the approach @xcite to the form of a secular equation , and in section [ sec : two - hydrogen - like - atoms ] of the paper we demonstrate the method on the example of two _ atoms _ with degenerate states .",

    "@xmath30 is the asymptotic coefficient .",
    "the two - electron wave function @xmath31 in the absence of spin - orbital interaction can be factorized into the product of spin @xmath32 and coordinate @xmath33 parts , where the former may be either a singlet @xmath34 or a triplet @xmath35 , and the latter is an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian@xmath36 here @xmath37 is the total spin and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , etc .    in ( [ ham0 ] )",

    "second , overlap of the wave functions of electrons ( [ decay ] ) on the two atoms enables them to exchange position by tunneling .",
    "this lifts the original degeneracy in energies of the isolated - atom states .",
    "in contrast to van der waals interactions , the resulting exchange splitting , which exponentially decreases with distance , can not be calculated perturbatively .",
    "one can use symmetry reasoning to construct the correct two - electron wave functions from the localized wave functions @xmath44 and interchanged @xmath45",
    ". then the energy splitting is found by substituting those combinations into hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) .    in the simplest case when atomic states are",
    "each only doubly degenerate in spin projection @xmath7 , the correct two - electron functions are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the localized wave functions @xcite .",
    "as total fermionic wave function must be antisymmetric in particle permutation @xmath46 , the singlet state corresponds to a symmetric coordinate wave function and the triplet state  to an antisymmetric one .",
    "hence the energy splitting between triplet and singlet states is given by@xmath47 where @xmath48 is found by substituting symmetric and antisymmetric combinations into hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) ( see below ) .",

    "the case of linear spin - orbital interaction has also been studied differently in ref . @xcite .",
    "as we will see later , calculation of the exchange interaction between two shallow acceptor centers has much in common with the problem of two hydrogen atoms each in a state with non - zero momentum discussed in section [ sec : two - hydrogen - like - atoms ] and in the appendix .",
    "however , the analogy is not complete , the calculations become laborious and we have not performed them fully . in what follows we only determine the _ sign _ of the exchange interaction .",
    "more precisely , it is shown that the magnetic moment in the ground state of a pair of acceptors equals zero .",
    "we begin this section by first reviewing the properties of a single acceptor center .    without taking spin - orbital interaction into account the valent band of typical semiconductors ( ge , si , iii - v ) would be six - fold degenerate at the point @xmath255 .",
    "spin - orbital interaction splits the valent band into a two- and four - fold degenerate bands separated by a gap .",
    "if the spin - orbital splitting is large with respect to the binding energy of an acceptor , the two - fold degenerate band can be neglected .",
    "for @xmath256 the four - fold degeneracy of the upper - lying band is lifted and two two - fold bands of light and heavy holes are formed .",
