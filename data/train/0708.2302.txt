    "individual qubits with the help of which we attempt to build our would - be quantum computers are fragile because we must have full control over the states of each of them separately and of all of them collectively within any time window . in many proposals",
    "qubits are held in traps ",
    "electrical , magnetic , or optical .",
    "controlling their states in traps over time and getting information from them during calculations can decohere and unstabilize them .",
    "the less energy transferred by probes , usually flying qubits , to a qubit sitting in a trap , the better .",
    "it would be the best to have no energy transfer at all .",
    "quantum mechanics provides a way to do this .",
    "whenever we _",
    "fail _ to detect a quantum system in one of the paths it would take to interfere with itself , we `` erase '' the interference fringes we would have got , if we had not carried out any detection or measurement at all @xcite .",
    "dicke called such a measurement an _ interaction - free measurement _",
    "@xcite and elitzur and vaidman realized that such measurements might be useful whenever we do not want to transfer energy to a measured object @xcite .",
    "the measurements are also called _ energy - exchange - free _",
    "@xcite , _ absorption - free _",
    "@xcite , and _ counterfactual _ @xcite measurements , as well as _ quantum interrogations _ @xcite .",
    "two implementations of interaction - free measurements in quantum computation have recently been proposed .",
    "one , proposed by richard jozsa @xcite , considers atoms as quantum computers ( or parts of them ) and flying qubits ( photons ) as their switches .",
    "thus one of the two possible states of an atom resulting from a `` computation '' can be read `` for free , '' with no transfer of energy to the atom , i.e. , without the `` computer '' actually running .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that the other state can not be obtained for free @xcite .",
    "the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate used in this approach has photon states as its control qubits and output register states as its target qubits .",
    "the other proposal considers interaction - free measurements that are used to implement essential parts of quantum computations , notably cnot gates and entanglement @xcite .",
    "cnot gates are essential for quantum computing because they enable us to set up any quantum gate and therefore to implement any available algorithm .",
    "entanglement appears in almost all blueprints of quantum computer candidates .    in constructing an interaction - free cnot gate",
    ", hiroo azuma @xcite uses a positron as a straight moving control qubit that blocks ( @xmath0 times , where @xmath1 ) the paths of a zig - zagging electron  a target qubit .",
    "the cnot gate is constructed not directly but using bell - basis measurements by the method of gottesman - chuang @xcite . in the mthot - wicker method ,",
    "the qubits of the cnot gate are two - level atoms , and photons only pass information between atoms @xcite .",
    "gilchrist , white , and munro @xcite do use atoms as control qubits and photons as target qubits in a quantum zeno setup , but to obtain a gate which could be called a _ destructive _ cnot gate , since one of the target qubits must be destroyed and therefore one of the four outputs of the standard cnot gate is not available .    in this paper",
    "we propose a _ nondestructive _ cnot gate in which a two - level atom in a trap is the control qubit and a photon interrogating it  without transferring a single quantum of energy to it  is the target qubit .",
    "`` nondestructive '' means that all four modes of the gate are available .",
    "@xcite the proposal is an elaboration of the cnot - gate setup put forward in ref .",
    "a particular feature of the gate is that the target qubit can also _ physically control _ its control qubit by preventing the latter from entering into a superposition of its two available states .",
    "we carry out this _ interaction - free _ interrogation with the help of a photon resonator , and we prepare the atom by _ stimulated raman adiabatic passage _ , stirap .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in sections",

    "we make use of a resonator which consists of two perfect mirrors and two highly asymmetrical mirrors that determine photon round trips as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pellin ] . other setups that minimize reflection losses are also possible @xcite .",
    "a laser beam enters the resonator through highly asymmetrical beam splitter abs . when there is no object in the resonator , an incoming laser beam is almost completely transmitted into detector _",

    "thus the reflectivity @xmath4 can reach 0.9999 or higher .",
    "the uniqueness of the reflectivity at the beam splitters and perfect mirrors is assured by choosing the orientation of the polarization of the incoming laser beam perpendicular to the plane of incidence .",
    "the source of the incoming beam should be a continuous wave ( cw ) laser ( e.g. , nd : yag ) , because of its coherence length ( up to 300@xmath5 km ) and because of its very narrow linewidth ( down to 10@xmath5khz in the visible range ) .",

    "we see that , in the long run , for any @xmath14 and @xmath15 we get no reflection at all  i.e .",
    ", no response from @xmath16if nothing obstructs the round trip , and almost a perfect reflection when the object blocks the round trip and @xmath4 is close to one . in terms of single photons ( obtained by attenuating the intensity of the laser until the chance of having more than one photon at a time becomes negligible ) the probability of detector @xmath16 reacting when there is no object in the system is zero .",
    "a response from @xmath16 indicates an interaction - free detection of an object in the system .",
    "the probability of the response is @xmath4 , the probability of making the object absorb the photon @xmath17 , and the probability of a photon exiting into @xmath18 detector @xmath19 .",
    "detailed wave packet calculations based on classical optical interference ( analogous to the calculations for laser resonators ) are carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite and they yield the following efficiencies of the suppression of the reflection ( @xmath20 ) into @xmath16 and of the throughput ( @xmath21 ) into @xmath18 when there is no object in the resonator : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a measure of overall losses and @xmath24d\\omega\\over\\displaystyle1- 2\\rho r \\cos[(\\omega- \\omega_{res})t]+\\rho^2r^2}\\over\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\infty \\exp[-{\\cal t}^2(\\omega-\\omega_{res})^2]d\\omega } \\,,\\label{eq : phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the coherence time and @xmath9 the round - trip time .    in effect , the resonator has to be `` charged '' to yield a superposition , i.e. , we have to allow the beam a sufficient number of round - trips to build up a destructive or constructive interference even when it contains just one photon .",
    "this corresponds to the sum which we used to obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : total ] ) and it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : round - trip ] .     as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 ( top ) , 150 , 50 , 20 , and 10 ( bottom ) .",
    "the differences in the shapes stem from the amount of losses.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    now the difference between the classical and the quantum picture of interference lies in the statistical behaviour of the flying quantum system  the photon .",
    "the classical approach does not permit an interaction - free detection , because there is always an exchange of energy , e.g.  @xmath30 .",
    "in the quantum approach , there can be no exchange of energy smaller than a quantum of energy @xmath31 corresponding to a single photon , and therefore only in the long run and on average the quantum energy transferred to an object does equal the classical energy .    therefore we can not narrow down the time window so as to make the coherence time less than the time required for interference to build up ( at least 100 round trips ) . if we did so , a photon could not enter the resonator whether or not the object was in the photon path . as a consequence , downconverted photons ( the signal to enter the resonator and the idler to control the event ) are not suitable sources of photons , because their coherence time is too short ( in the range of picoseconds ) .",
    "the use of a cw laser or a low emission led and their inability to control the number of photons within the time window do not , however , pose a problem to our interaction - free cnot gate , because we have two distinct outgoing ports , and because the time required for a sufficient number of round - trips is a few nanoseconds , which is short enough for use in quantum computation , where the decoherence typically ranges between nanoseconds and seconds .",
    "the purpose of interaction - free detection of a macroscopic object is to wipe out photon interference fringes so as to put the object in a photon path . in the case of atoms",
    "we do not physically block the photon path but make them opaque or transparent by bringing them into states in which they can or can not absorb a photon of a chosen frequency .",
    "this also means that if an atom can be in a superposition of such two states , its interaction - free interrogation by a photon will prevent it from entering the superposition . in this section",
    "we present a setup which can be used to make an atom ( in)visible to a photon in a resonator and to build up a cnot gate .",

    "@xmath32rb has @xmath52 , and its @xmath43 ground states are split by hyperfine interaction into doublets with @xmath53 .",
    "now we apply an external magnetic field * b * to the atom to split the levels into magnetic zeeman sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath54 . the levels are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : rubidium ] ( cf .  ref .",

    "the @xmath57 one is called the _ pump _ beam ( with rabi frequency @xmath60 ) ; ( b ) two pump beams ( @xmath60 , @xmath59 ) and a cavity with atom  cavity coupling ( @xmath61 ) instead of the stokes laser beams produce superposition @xmath62.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    to excite and deexcite electrons between @xmath63 and @xmath64 we must use circularly polarized photons with angular momentum @xmath65 and two additional degrees of freedom ( eigenvalues of @xmath66 ) denoted @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "linearly polarized photons can not be used because the selection rules require @xmath68 for them .",

    "[ sec : stirap ] we saw that a left - hand circularly polarized photon can excite an atom from its ground state @xmath74 ( @xmath100 ) to its excited state @xmath55 ( @xmath101 ) , and that the right - hand circularly polarized photon can excite the atom from @xmath75 ( @xmath102 ) to @xmath55 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "so an @xmath12-photon will `` see '' the atom in @xmath74 but will not `` see '' it when it is in @xmath75 . with an @xmath4-photon , the opposite is true .",

    "[ fig : pellin ] ) . to show that the atom in @xmath74 ( @xmath74 ) is realistically opaque for @xmath12 ( @xmath4 ) circularly polarized photons , we must resort to quantum theory and we shall come back to this point in the second half of this section .",
    "this feature of our resonator approach that there are no photon loops in it when the atom is opaque is yet another advantage over a zeno - like setup .",
    "we have to carry out quantum calculations only of a single absorption of a photon by the atom which reduces to a single strong atom - photon interaction while in a zeno setup each photon loop inside a cavity with an opaque atom includes a strong photon - atom interaction .",

    "@xcite    we feed our resonator with @xmath105 and @xmath106 linearly polarized photons to achieve the same conditions for round trips of both kinds of photons within the resonator . to the right of the atom we place a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) to turn a @xmath107-photon into an @xmath4-photon and a @xmath106-photon into an @xmath12-photon . to the left of the atom we place a half - wave plate ( hwp ) to change the direction of the circular polarization and then another qwp to transform the polarization back into the original linear polarization .",

    "what remains to be evaluated to estimate the level of coupling of the atom to the photon field is the quantization volume @xmath135 and the terms containing @xmath8 in the probability ( [ eq : abs - prob ] ) .",
    "the square root of the first two terms @xmath145 is called the _ dipole coupling constant _ @xcite , or the _ rate of coupling _ of an atom to a single cavity mode @xcite ( usually with the assumption that @xmath146 ) . in cqed and stirap cavities ,",
    "@xmath147 is compared with spontaneous emission from the atom ( transverse damping rate @xmath148 ) and with leaking out of the cavity ( damping rate @xmath149 ) .",
    "the calculations for these cavities differ from the one carried above , but the overall results are comparable . for the former cavities",
    "a _ strong coupling _ is achieved when @xmath147 is much larger than both @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "@xcite one can achieve this by making a cavity as small as possible thereby decreasing @xmath135 and making @xmath147 larger , by choosing atoms with a narrower atomic linewidth @xmath148 , and by decreasing the linewidth of the cavity mode @xmath149 . with our resonator cavity , however , we do not have to care about spontaneous emission and/or leaking from the cavity because the interaction - free absorption ( almost ) never really excites the atom and the photon ( almost ) never really reaches the atom .",
    "so , our resonator cavity does not have to be small . in sec.[sec : resonator ] we have seen that @xmath150 , where @xmath12 is the round - trip length of the cavity and @xmath13 is an integer . by picking a larger @xmath13 we get a larger cavity in which the birefringent optics would fit .",
    "after integrating the terms containing @xmath8 in ( [ eq : abs - prob ] ) over @xmath8 we get the rate of absorption : @xmath151 ( the probability turns out to be a function of @xmath152 ) . this rate is higher than the one we get in cqed experiments @xcite where the atoms move through a cavity with a velocity of over 100@xmath5 m/s and nevertheless couple strongly to the cavity field within less than 100@xmath153s . in our resonator",
    "we can achieve much longer and also shorter times ( @xmath154 ; the shortest time is limited by the resonance build - up time when a transparent object is in the resonator and the longest one by the coherence time of cw lasers ) .",
    "so , we can conclude that under realistic conditions the atom will be strongly coupled to our resonator cavity field .",
    "the shortest required times for the coupling have to be determined for a chosen atomic system .",
    "we should add that the stokes and pump beams for stirap switching @xmath155 can be used together with the resonator cavity inclined at a small angle to its beam because that beams are much stronger than the resonator beam and a small misalignment with the magnetic field @xmath140 will not significantly influence the transitions .   @xcite we can not carry out stirap transitions and",
    "run interaction - free cnot simultaneously because of the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) by the transitions .",
    "@xcite if we wanted to carry out interaction - free interrogations of stirap transitions , we should employ transitions that are not used by the transitions , e.g. , @xmath156 and @xmath157 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : superp ] .",
    "our design can also be used to control the stirap superposition of the states discussed in sec.[sec : stirap ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : stirap - state - e ] ) , in two ways .",
    "the first one is by determining a time span within which an atomic superposition can be built up and the second one is by suppressing the formation of atomic superposition using the interaction - free erasure of interference fringes obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the stirap process presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : stirap ] the electron is moved from the state @xmath86 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rubidium]@xmath5(b ) into the superposition of the states @xmath74 and @xmath75 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : stirap - state - e ] ) .",
    "interaction - free detection can be used to determine , within a few microseconds , when the electron leaves state @xmath86 , as follows .",
    "we use our interaction - free resonator with the interrogating paths perpendicular to the axis of the cavity and wave plates removed in order to probe the atom with a linearly polarized photon @xmath158 , denoted @xmath159 in fig .",
    "[ fig : superp ] ( a circularly polarized photon corresponding to the transition @xmath160 would also work ) .",
    "we tune the resonator and photons to the frequency @xmath161 that corresponds to a possible transition @xmath162 .",
    "when our resonator is applied to an atom in which a stirap transition @xmath163 is induced , its repeated interrogation will pinpoint the time of this transition .",
    "this is because the photon `` sees '' the electron if transition @xmath162 is possible and does not `` see '' it when it leaves @xmath86 . in the former case it exits at one port of the resonator and in the latter at the other .",
    "the photon can not of course really excite the atom , because it can not transfer any energy to it .    .",
    "if an electron is in one of the @xmath164 states , then a photon will exit through one port of the gate , and if not , through the other.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    assuming that a realistic round trip of our resonator can be reduced to a few cm and calculating @xcite that 200 to 300 round trips ( under 100@xmath5ns ) are sufficient to establish interference within the resonator , we calculates that a laser has to be _ on _ for several @xmath165s in order to detect whether or not an electron is in state @xmath86 , i.e. , whether the atom is opaque or transparent .",
    "we must therefore reduce the intensity of a cw laser so as to obtain on average one photon within this time window .",
    "the other way of controlling our stirap is to prevent building of superposition @xmath85 and forcing the electron into either state @xmath74 or state @xmath75 . for this purpose ,",
    "we use two interaction - free resonators with interrogating paths oriented perpendicularly to the axis of the cavity and tuned to frequencies @xmath166 and @xmath167 with circularly polarized photons , as shown in fig .  [ fig : superp ] .",
    "linearly polarized photons corresponding to transitions to @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively , would also work .",
    "note that the scheme with photons tuned to transitions @xmath170 and @xmath171 would not work , because , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : stirap ] , the atom is transparent to such photons in both cases  when there is no electron in states @xmath74 and @xmath75 and when stiraps are in progress . in the latter case we speak of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have obtained a probabilistic interaction - free cnot gate in which two atom zeeman states represent the control qubit and two photon polarization states represent the target qubit .",
    "the gate , which is a photon ring resonator , is robust because it does not transfer any energy to atoms in over 95%   of tests . unlike the previous atom - photon cnot gate",
    "@xcite , this gate has all four modes available , because it has two exit ports for photons , each of which can let photons in both polarization states out , depending on the state the atom is in .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : i - f - cnot ] we carried out quantum calculations and made realistic estimations for a possible experiment .",
    "if we confine ions ( e.g. , @xmath34ca@xmath35 ) to under 10@xmath5 nm by using a paul trap and mount the resonator around it , we arrive at the rate of absorption which is higher than in other experimentally tested cavities .",
    "this amounts to a strong coupling between the atoms in our ring cavity and its field modes .",
    "the interaction - free resonator can also be used to control a stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) from an individual state to a state of superposition .",
    "we can control the time when an atom changes its state .",
    "such detection takes under 1@xmath153s .",
    "another control we can exert over qubits is to suppress atom - state superposition .",
    "the quantum system is altered without any energy transfer to the system in observation of the quantum indistiguishability principle , which states that no information can be acquired about the population of particular states which take part in a superposition .",
    "thus the interaction - free resonator can be used in quantum computation to manipulate qubits and to obtain information on them during computation without decohering their states .",
    "it is suitable for systems that can be scaled up because it is non - destructive , i.e. , it does not destroy the output states , and because it provides information on the success of the cnot - gate operation that can be used for subsequent manipulation of the same photon qubits .",
    "more specifically , we can amplify the null detections of detector d in fig .",
