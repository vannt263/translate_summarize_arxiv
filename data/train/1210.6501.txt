    "one of the most active areas of research in condensed matter physics at present is the study of the high critical temperature ( @xmath6 ) superconductors based on iron .",
    "this field started with the seminal discovery of superconductivity at 26  k in f - doped lafeaso ( kamihara _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "several other superconductors with a similar structure were synthesized since 2008 ( for a review see johnston , 2010 ; stewart , 2011 ) .",
    "they all have feas or fese layers that are widely believed to be the key component of these iron - based superconductors , similarly as the cuo@xmath3 layers are the crucial ingredients of the famous high @xmath6 cuprates ( dagotto , 1994 ; scalapino , 1995 ) .",
    "the many analogies between the iron - based superconductors and the cuprates lie not only on the quasi two - dimensional characteristics of the active layers , but also in the proximity to magnetically ordered states that in many theoretical approaches are believed to induce superconductivity via unconventional pairing mechanisms that do not rely on phonons . however , at least for the case of the iron - superconductors based on as , the parent magnetic compounds are metallic , as opposed to the mott insulators found in the cuprates , establishing an important difference between cuprates and pnictides .",
    "the feas@xmath7 tetrahedra is the basic building block of the feas layers .",
    "materials such as lafeaso belong to the `` 1111 '' family , with a record critical temperature of 55  k for smfeaso ( ren _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "subsequent efforts unveiled superconductivity also in the doped versions of `` 122 '' compounds such as bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 , `` 111 '' compounds such as lifeas , and others ( johnston , 2010 ; paglione and greene , 2010 ; stewart , 2011 ; wang and lee , 2011 ; hirschfeld , korshunov , and mazin , 2011 ) .",
    "it is important to remark that there are structurally related materials , known as the `` 11 '' family , that display equally interesting properties .",
    "a typical example is fese that also superconducts , although at a lower @xmath6 of 8  k ( hsu _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "fese has a simpler structure than the pnictides since there are no atoms in between the fese layers .",
    "locally , the iron cations are tetrahedrally coordinated to se , as it occurs in feas@xmath7 .",
    "the critical temperature can dramatically increase by te substitution or even more by pressure up to 37  k ( fang , m. h. , _ et al . _ , 2008 ; yeh _ et al . _ , 2008",
    "; margadonna _ et al .",
    "_ , 2009 ) . the normal state of fe(se , te ) is electronically more correlated than for iron pnictides ( tamai _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ) .",
    "the study of iron superconductors based on se ( the iron selenides ) is less advanced than the similar studies in the case of as ( the iron pnictides ) , and it is precisely the goal of this review to focus on the most recent developments in the area that is often referred to as the `` alkaline iron selenides , '' with an alkali metal element intercalated in between the fese layers .",
    "note that this set of compounds should be better called `` alkali metal iron selenides '' to avoid a confusion with the `` alkaline earth metals '' ( be , mg , ca , sr , ba , and ra ) .",
    "for this reason , in this review the more precise notation alkali metal iron selenides will be used .",
    "also the more general term chalcogenides will not be used here since our focus below is exclusively on compounds with fese layers , not with fete layers . at present",
    ", the field of alkali metal iron selenides is receiving considerable attention not only because the @xmath6s are now comparable to those of the iron pnictides but also because some of these selenides are magnetic insulators , potentially bringing closer the fields of the iron - superconductors and the copper - superconductors .",
    "one of the motivations for the use of alkali elements to separate the fese layers is that the @xmath6 of the iron - based superconductors appears to be regulated by the `` anion height , '' i.e. the height of the anion from the iron - square lattice planes ( mizuguchi _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ) .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed that the closer the fe@xmath8@xmath7 is to the ideal tetrahedron , the higher @xmath6 becomes ( qiu _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "then , via chemical substitutions or intercalations @xmath6 could be further enhanced since that process will alter , and possibly optimize , the local structure .    in this manuscript ,",
    "this very active field of `` alkali metal iron selenides '' will be reviewed . before explaining the organization of this article , it is important to remark that this is _ not _ a review of the full field of iron - based superconductors , which would be a formidable task .",
    "instead the focus is on the recent developments for compounds with chemical formulas @xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 ( @xmath4 = alkali element ) that not only show superconductivity at temperatures comparable to those of the pnictides , but they also present insulating and magnetic properties at several compositions , establishing a closer link to the cuprates .",
    "in fact , many studies reviewed below suggest that a proper description of @xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 requires at the minimum an intermediate value of the hubbard repulsion @xmath0 in units of the carriers bandwidth .",
    "this degree of electronic correlation is needed , for instance , to explain the large magnetic moment per iron observed in these novel compounds .",
    "last but not least , the notorious absence of fermi surface ( fs ) hole pockets in these materials , as also reviewed below , prevents the applicability of the ideas widely discussed for the iron pnictides that rely on the fs nesting between electron and hole pockets . since there are no hole pockets , an alternative starting point is needed to explain the physics of the iron selenides .",
    "it is fair to express that pnictides and selenides may be in different classes of magnetic and superconducting materials , even if the pairing arises in both cases from magnetic fluctuations .",
    "for instance , the former could be based on itinerant spin density wave states , while the latter could arise from local moments .",
    "however , mere simplicity also suggests that pnictides and selenides may share a unique mechanism to generate their magnetic and superconducting states .",
    "if this is the case , then learning about the physics of the @xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 compounds may drastically alter the conceptual framework used for the entire field of research centered at the iron - based superconductors .",
    "the organization of the review is as follows : in section ii , the early history of the alkali metal iron selenides is provided , with information about the crystal structure , basic properties , and the ordered states of the iron vacancies . in section iii ,",
    "investigations using angle - resolved photoemission are reviewed , with emphasis on the two most important results : absence of hole pockets at the fs and isotropic superconducting gaps .",
    "section iv contains the neutron scattering results , showing the exotic magnetic states in the presence of iron vacancies , particularly the block antiferromagnetic state .",
    "section v addresses the existence of phase separation into superconducting and magnetic regions , and also the much debated issue of which states should be considered the parent states for superconductivity .",
    "results obtained using a variety of other experimental techniques are in section vi .",
    "theoretical calculations , using both first principles and model hamiltonian approaches , are in section vii .",
    "the experimentally observed phases are discussed from the theory perspective , as well as a variety of competing states .",
    "section viii describes recent efforts focussed on two - leg ladder selenides , which display several common aspects with the layered iron selenides .",
    "finally , in section ix several closely related topics are discussed , including the discovery of superconductivity in a single layer of fese .",
    "due to length constrains some topics that would make this review self - contained , such as the crystallography of the materials of focus here , can not be included .",
    "however , recent reviews ( johnston , 2010 ; stewart , 2011 ) can be consulted by the readers to compensate for this missing information . a recent brief review about the alkali metal iron selenides ( mou , zhao , and zhou , 2011 ) can also be consulted for a broader perspective on this topic .",

    "in this publication the `` hot '' topic of alkali metal iron selenides has been reviewed .",
    "the main reasons for the current excitement in this area of research includes the realization that these materials do not have hole pockets at the @xmath24 point , altering conceptually the dominant perception that originated in the pnictides with regards to the importance of fermi surface nesting between electron and hole pockets to understand the magnetic and sc states .",
    "this conclusion is compatible with the recent accumulation of evidence that fermi surface nesting and a weak coupling perspective are actually not sufficient for the the pnictides ( dai , hu , and dagotto , 2012 ) .",
    "moreover , via arpes techniques applied to some alkali metal iron selenides , the small electron ( not hole ) pocket at @xmath24 was investigated and in the sc state this pocket does not present nodes , removing the @xmath43-wave state as a possibility ( although this issue is still under discussion as explained before ) .",
    "thus , the menu of options for the symmetry of the sc order parameter in these selenides appears reduced to a conventional same - sign @xmath42-wave state ( realized via a coupling of the electrons to the lattice ) , or a more exotic form of the @xmath42@xmath107 state ( mazin , 2011 ) , different from the @xmath42@xmath107 state proposed for the pnictides ( johnston , 2010 ) .",
    "also note that the same - sign @xmath42-wave may not explain the neutron spin resonances in the alkali metal iron selenides ( scalapino , 2012 ) .",
    "thus , only further work can clarify entirely this subtle matter .",
    "another reason for the excitement in this area of research is the possibility of having an insulating parent compound of the sc state , perhaps a mott insulator .",
    "candidate states with an ordered distribution of iron vacancies have been identified at particular compositions of iron .",
    "some of these states display an exotic magnetic state that contains 2@xmath162 blocks of aligned iron moments , with an afm coupling between blocks .",
    "other states have also been proposed as parent compounds , and a final answer has not been given to this matter .",
    "in this same context of exploring mott insulators in the iron superconductors arena , note that iron has been replaced by other transition metal elements , such as mn , leading to interesting results including afm insulators and metallic states upon doping , although not yet to superconductivity . for the case of bamn@xmath3as@xmath3 , the reader can consult johnston _ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) and pandey _ et al . _",
    "( 2012 ) , and literature cited therein .",
    "this line of exploration is promising and it should be further pursued .    finally , the presence of phase separation has also attracted considerable attention .",
    "are the magnetic and sc states competing or cooperating ? this is also a recurrent open question for the sc copper oxides as well .",
    "note that such competition or cooperation is only relevant if the states can influence one another by either sharing the same volume element , i.e. microscopically coexisting , or by forming an inhomogeneous state at such short length scales that one state can still affect the other and viceversa .",
    "in fact , in several feas - based materials there is evidence that the two competing states do share the same volume element ( johnston , 2010 ) , while in the selenides the situation is still evolving with regards to the length - scales involved in the phase separation process .    in summary",
    ", the young subfield of alkali metal iron selenides is challenging the prevailing ideas for the pnictides .",
    "it could occur that selenides and pnictides may harbor different pairing mechanisms , or they may have different strengths in their hubbard @xmath0 couplings .",
    "after all , the pnictides have afm metallic states as parent compounds of superconductivity , while the selenides may have afm insulators as parent compounds based on the discussion presented in this review .",
    "however , by mere simplicity it is also reasonable to assume that a unique qualitative mechanism could be at work simultaneously in both families of compounds .",
    "perhaps short - range afm fluctuations may be similarly operative as the pairing mechanism in the context of both metallic and insulating parent states .",
    "all these important issues are still under much discussion , and by focusing on the new alkali metal iron selenides the several intriguing conceptual questions raised by the discovery of the iron - based superconductors may soon converge to an answer .",
