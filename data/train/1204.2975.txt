    " one can conceive of information theory in the broad sence as covering the theory of gaining , transferring , and storing information , where the first is usually called statistics.\"@xcite .    shannon information theory and mathematical statistics interaction",
    "revealed to be effective .",
    "this interplay is mutually fruitful , in some works results of probability theory and statistics were obtained with application of information - theoretical methods and there are studies where statistical results provide ground for new findings in information theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "this paper can serve an illustration of application of information - theoretical methods in statistics : on one hand this is analogy in problem formulation and on the other hand this is employment of technical tools of proof , specifically of the method of types @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is often necessary in statistical research to make decisions regarding the nature and parameters of stochastic model , in particular , the probability distribution of the object .",
    "decisions can be made on the base of results of observations of the object .",
    "the vector of results is called a sample .",
    "the correspondence between samples and hypotheses can be designed based on some selected criterion .",
    "the procedure of statistical hypotheses detection is called test .",
    "the classical problem of statistical hypothesis testing refers to two hypotheses .",
    "based on data samples a statistician makes decision on which of the two proposed hypotheses must be accepted .",
    "many mathematical investigations , some of which have also applied significance , were implemented in this direction @xcite .",
    "the need of testing of more than two hypotheses in many scientific and applied fields has essentially increased recently . as an instance microarray analysis",
    "could be mentioned @xcite .",
    "the decisions can be erroneous due to randomness of the sample .",
    "the test is considered as good if the probabilities of the errors in given conditions are as small as possible .",
    "frequently the problem was solved for the case of a tests sequence , where the probabilities of error decrease exponentially as @xmath0 , when the number of observations @xmath1 tends to the infinity .",
    "we call the exponent of error probability @xmath2 the _ reliability_. in case of two hypotheses both reliabilities corresponding to two possible error probabilities could not be increased simultaneously , it is an accepted way to fix the value of one of the reliabilities and try to make the tests sequence get the greatest value of the remaining reliability .",
    "such a test is called _ logarithmically asymptotically optimal _",
    "such optimal tests were considered first by hoeffding @xcite , examined later by csiszr and longo @xcite , tusnady @xcite , @xcite ( he called such test series _ exponentially rate optimal _ ( ero ) ) , longo and sgarro @xcite .",
    "the term lao for testing of two hypotheses was proposed by birge @xcite . amongst papers on testing , associated with information theory ,",
    "we can also note works of natarajan @xcite , gutman @xcite , anantharam @xcite , han @xcite and of many others . some objectives in this direction were first suggested in original introductory article by dobrushin , pinsker and shiryaev @xcite .",
    "the achievable region of error probability exponents was examined by tuncel @xcite .",
    "the problem has common features with the issue studied in the information theory on interrelation between the rate @xmath3 of the code and the exponent @xmath2 of the error probability . in information theory",
    "the relation @xmath4 is called according to shannon the _ reliability function _ , while @xmath5 is named the @xmath2-_capacity _ , or the _ reliability - rate function _ , as it was introduced by haroutunian @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    simple but actual concept of not only separate but also simultaneous investigation of some number of objects of the same type , evidently , was first formulated by ahlswede and haroutunian @xcite for reliable testing of distributions of multiple items .",
    "but simultaneous examination of properties of many similar objects may be attractive and effective in plenty of other statistical situations .",
