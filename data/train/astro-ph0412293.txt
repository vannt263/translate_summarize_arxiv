    "diffuse elliptical galaxies ( de , also called dwarf elliptical or dwarf spheroidal galaxies ) are dwarf ( @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xmath2 ) , structureless ( at least at first sight ; hence their name ) and diffuse : light profiles are nearly exponential , des never show de vaucouleurs profiles , the srsic exponent is normally between 0.6 and 3 .",
    "they are also ubiquitous in clusters : for instance , more than 70%  of known virgo cluster members are des .",
    "the de galaxies are not well studied because they are difficult to observe : their surface brightness , metallicity ( absorption - line contrast ) and intrinsic rotation / chaotic velocities are low and therefore require long observing time and high spectral resolution .",
    "they were believed to be simple objects , until recent high quality observations revealed fine structures , in particular the presence of a spectacular and intriguing stellar spiral in ic  3328 ( jerjen et al .",
    "2000 ) and ic  783 ( barazza et al . 2002 ) or other structures , like embedded discs or bars in a lot of des ( barazza et al . 2002 ) .",
    "a number of recent papers presented also long slit spectroscopic data ( simien & prugniel 2002 , pedraz et al . , geha et al 2002 , 2003 , de rijcke et al .",
    "2001 , van zee et al .",
    "2004 ) revealing their diversity .",
    "the majority of de appear rotationally supported , with some very noticeable exceptions of clearly anisotropic systems ( simien & prugniel 2002 ) .",
    "some examples of kinematically decoupled cores were found by de rijcke et al .",
    "the stellar population also present a cosmic dispersion which suggests a diversity of the origin of evolutionary history of de ( michielsen et al .",
    "some ionized ism has been detected in some cases ( michielsen et al .",
    "the first scenario is a hierarchical collapse with a feedback of star formation ( dekel & silk 1986 , mori et al .",
    "1997 ) . some difficulties of this theory existed .",
    "they were caused by the disagreement between fundamental properties of the des obtained from observations and computed using common models of that process .",
    "in particular , observed velocity dispersions for fainter galaxies were lower than had been expected ( faber - jackson relation ) . the problem has been solved recently by taking into account effects of the dynamical response to starburst - induced gas removal ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 ) .",
    "the other scenarios give the first role to the effects of environment .",
    "three main mechanisms are discussed : ( 1 ) the ram - pressure gas stripping of late spirals and dwarf irregulars in clusters ( mori & burkert 2000 ) and groups ( marcolini et al . 2003 ) ; ( 2 ) the tidal harassment due to distant and repeated encounters with other cluster members ( moore et al . 1998 ) ; ( 3 ) the collisions between large gas - rich spirals which may eject massive gas tails from which a dwarf galaxy may born ( tidal dwarfs ) and evolve into a de after fading of the young stellar population ( duc et al .",
    "this last possibility can surely not be the main scenario because de s are one order of magnitude more numerous than large galaxies which in average have experienced one major collision in their lifetime .",
    "it is likely that both the wind - controlled early evolution and the environment effects combine to produce the actual state of de .",
    "the moderate or low metallicity of most de indicates that the stars were formed in small galaxies subject to the winds that prevent enrichment , but on the other hands environment effects can not be avoided .",
    "ram pressure stripping is the accepted explanation for the hi depletion of spiral galaxies in clusters , and any gas - rich galaxy in a cluster has to experience it .",
    "it may well explain the relation between the morphology of dwarfs and the density of the environment ( binggeli et al .",
    "1990 , van den bergh 1994 ) : low - density environments are mostly populated by dirr s , while de s reside mostly in clusters where ram pressure stripping is expected to be the most efficient .",
    "recently , conselice et al . ( 2003 ) found hi in 7 des in the virgo cluster , which they interpreted as transition objects on their way in the morphological transformation from dirr to de . in a series of papers ,",
    "conselice et al . ( 2001 , 2002 ) argue that des have been accreted quite recently and have formed from late type galaxies after they have crossed the center of the cluster .    to bring additional constraints we started a survey of de galaxies with integral field spectroscopy .",
    "we are searching for kinematical structures , eventually related to morphological fine structures , and for subsequent structures in the spatial distribution of the stellar population properties .",
    "evidently , both types of the structures are to be connected by a common origin .",
    "we are presenting here the first study of ic  3653 , a de in the virgo cluster , by the means of integral - field spectroscopy , with the mpfs ( multi - pupil fiber spectrograph ) of the 6-m telescope ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the galaxy was observed under good atmospheric conditions ( seeing @xmath4 ) in the spectral range between 4150  and 5650 , the total integration time was 2.5 hours .",
    "the voronoi adaptive binning technique ( cappellari & copin , 2003 ) was used to keep rather high signal - to - noise ratio over the field of view of the mpfs ( 16@xmath516 array of @xmath6 elements ) .    to analyse the data , and in particular to attempt to constraint the history of the stellar population we are using new technique based on the recent evolutionary synthesis tool pegase.hr ( le borgne et al .",
    "pegase.hr is used to generate a grid of simple stellar populations ( ssp ) covering the range of metallicities expected for de galaxies .",
    "these ssps are sampled at different ages , building finally a grid in age and metallicity .",
    "our inversion method consists of fitting simultaneously the line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvd ) and the distributions of ssps in age and metallicity in every point of the field of view .",
    "the flux - calibrated ssps were generated with the elodie library at a resolution r=10000 , and the first step of the analysis required to adjust the spectral resolution to the one of the mpfs observations which varies both with wavelength and with the position in the field of view of the spectrograph .",
    "since the resolution of the spectrograph is not higher than the kinematical broadening , this resolution matching must be extremely precise .",
    "the principle of combining several templates in the kinematical analysis is widely used since about 10 years in order to reduce the so - called template miss - match .",
    "this approach , called optimal template fitting , generally includes an additive low - order polynomial which absorbs the effects of metallicity miss - match and of diffuse light .",
    "therefore , the best fitting combination can not be interpreted in terms of stellar population .",
    "for the present work , we have for the first time a library of templates with a suited range of metallicities and with a high quality , hence we did not include any additive term and attempted to interpret the resulting weight of the ssps as an history of the stellar population .",
    "as stated , the correction of diffuse light is particularly critical for this analysis , and it is not straightforward for 2d spectrographs .",
    "our procedure was tested by simulations which proved its accuracy .",
    "our mpfs data for ic  3653 being analysed by this method have revealed some interesting properties of this virgo dwarf elliptical .",
    "we find significant kinematical peculiarities in the galaxy .",
    "the gradient of the line - of - sight velocity in the central region is very steep .",
    "velocity dispersion shows a sharp peak slightly off - centered .",
    "it may indicate the presence of a kinematically decoupled core as it is observed in several giant elliptical galaxies ( franx & illingworth , 1998 ) and suggested in some other des ( morelli et al .",
    "the disk - like kinematical feature has no morphological counterpart on acs images from the hst archive ( proposal 9401 by ct ) .",
    "the kinematical data are shown in fig .  1 and fig .",
    "2    integrated properties of the stellar population show no significant gradients ; the measurements of the lick indices in the spectrum of the centre of the galaxy is shown in fig .",
    "the mean stellar age derived from these measurements is @xmath7 gyr , the metallicity is solar ( @xmath8 = 0.0 \\pm 0.04 $ ] ) .",
    "the comparison of ic  3653 with the prototypical de ngc  205 and compact elliptical galaxy m  32 is shown in tab .  1 ( population data are from trager et .",
    "al . , 1998 ) .",
    "ic  3653 is a relatively bright object compared to the des drawn from geha et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "though its population ressemble more to m  32 than to ngc  205 , its diffuse structure relates it more closely to the sequence of des than to the es to which m  32 belongs .",
    "ic  3653 is located at the top of the de sequence and its high metallicity locates it on the natural mass - metallicity relation .",
    "our stellar population fit also indicates the solar metallicity without any scatter and an age distribution tightly picked at 7 gyr with marginal indication of an intermediate age sub - population at an age of 1 gyr with a mass fraction of about 3% .",
    "the difficulty of the inversion is to prove its uniqueness , in particular because of degeneracies of the problem ( between age and metallicity , or velocity dispersion and metallicity ) .",
    "we have not investigated this issue in detail yet , so the final conclusions will be presented in a forthcoming paper ; but the announced solar metallicity appears to be robust .",
    "the kinematics in the core region is not spatially resolved with the present observations and further observations are required .",
    "evidences for kinematical structures in de establish a link with small spiral or dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "many of the de yet studied in detail are not genuine spheroids , they are not like big and diffuse globular clusters . de may generally have formed from low - mass units , which developed a disk .",
    "the winds have controlled the enrichment and the dynamical feedback has thickened or destroyed the disk .",
    "the ram pressure stripping , when the future de crossed the denses regions of the cluster finished to remove the cold gas left , in particular in the plane of the disk , by the anisotropic winds .",
    "the long - lived features in the stellar population can still be observed now , 5 or 10 gyr after their formation .",
    "we would like to thank the jenam-2004 organizing committee for providing financial support for one of the authors , cnrs for providing funding bi - lateral collaboration , and sao ras time allocation committee for allocating time on the 6-m telescope ."
