    "<S> this work takes part in the efforts to understand the categorification of rings and other related algebraic structures . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of categorification of algebraic structures has been around for several decades and has gradually become better appreciated and understood . </S>",
    "<S> the expanding scope and applications of the notion of categorification has been greatly influenced by the works of baez - dolan @xcite , crane - frenkel @xcite , crane - yetter @xcite , khovanov @xcite , among others . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is that it is worthwhile to look at the categorical foundations of set theoretical structures . </S>",
    "<S> often sets arise as the equivalences classes of objects in a category . </S>",
    "<S> going from a category to the set of equivalences classes of its objects is the process of decategorification . </S>",
    "<S> categorification goes in the reverse direction , uncovering categories whose set of equivalences classes of objects reproduces a given set . </S>",
    "<S> categorifications always exist but are no unique . </S>",
    "<S> thus two general problems arise : the classification of categorifications and the extraction of information regarding a given set theoretical construction from its categorical counterpart . + </S>",
    "<S> our approach to the categorification of rings , reviewed in section [ caterings ] , was first discussed in @xcite with a view towards the categorification of the ring of functions on non - commutative spaces and the categorification of the algebra of annihilation and creation operators . </S>",
    "<S> further developments aimed at the elaboration of a general setting for the study of the combinatorial properties of rational numbers were reported in @xcite , where the combinatorics of bernoulli numbers and hypergeometric functions , respectively , are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> our aim in this work is to study the categorification of rota - baxter rings @xcite , an algebraic structure under current active research because of its capacity to unify notions coming from probability theory , combinatorics , symmetric functions , and the renormalization of feynman integrals among others . </S>",
    "<S> applications of rota - baxter categories in the context of renormalization of feynman integrals will be study in the forthcoming works @xcite . + this paper is organized as follows . in section [ caterings ] </S>",
    "<S> we introduce rota - baxter categories and provide a couple of basic examples . in section [ erbc ] we provided the simplest and most ubiquitous example of rota - baxter category . </S>",
    "<S> this sort of rota - baxter category are constructed from any distributive category and may be thought as categorifications of the rota - baxter ring of formal laurent series . in section [ cmc ] </S>",
    "<S> we construct rota - baxter categories associated with an arbitrary comonoidal category and a given rota - baxter category . </S>",
    "<S> this construction should be thought as the categorification of the ring of formal power series with coefficients in a rota - baxter ring . in sections </S>",
    "<S> [ ibf ] and [ bf ] we construct rota - baxter categories from idempotent and arbitrary bimonoidal functors , respectively . in sections </S>",
    "<S> [ ci ] and [ hoy ] we define categorical integration and show in three different contexts , categorical riemannian integration , discrete analogues of integration and categorical jackson integrals from @xmath0-calculus , that functorial integration provides examples of ( twisted ) rota - baxter categories of various weights . in section [ cft ] and [ qft ] </S>",
    "<S> we construct rota - baxter categories naturally arising from classical and quantum field theory , respectively . </S>"
