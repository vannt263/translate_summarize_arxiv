    "the domain wall ( dw ) boundary condition of a statistical model on a finite two - dimensional lattice was first introduced in @xcite for the six - vertex model .",
    "the partition function of the model ( or dw partition function ) was then expressed in terms of a determinant @xcite .",
    "such a determinant representation of the partition function has played an important role in constructing norms of bethe states , correction functions @xcite and thermodynamical properties of the six - vertex model @xcite , and also in analyzing the toda theories @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proven to be very useful in solving some pure mathematical problems , such as the problem of alternating sign matrices @xcite .",
    "recently , the determinant representations of the dw partition function have been obtained for various models @xcite .",
    "for a two - dimensional statistical model with a reflection end @xcite , in addition to the local interaction vertex , a reflecting matrix or k - matrix @xcite which describes the boundary interactions needs to be introduced at the reflection end of the lattice ( see figure 4 below ) .",
    "the dw partition function of the six - vertex model with a diagonal reflection end was exactly calculated and expressed in terms some determinant @xcite .",
    "such determinant representation of the model was re - derived @xcite by using the drinfeld twist or factorizing f - matrix @xcite method @xcite .",
    "however , it is highly non - trivial to generalize this result to models with non - diagonal boundary terms @xcite . very recently , determinant representations of dw partition functions have been obtained for the trigonometric sos model with reflection end @xcite and the six - vertex model with a non - diagonal reflection end @xcite .    among solvable models ,",
    "elliptic ones stand out as a particularly important class due to the fact that most trigonometric and rational models can be obtained from them by certain limits . in this paper , we focus on the most fundamental elliptic model  the eight - vertex model @xcite whose trigonometric limit gives the six - vertex model . here",
    "we obtain the determinant representation of the dw partition function of the eight - vertex model with a non - diagonal reflection end specified by the generic non - diagonal k - matrix @xcite .",
    "our result shows that contrary to the eight - vertex model without reflection end whose dw partition function can only be expressed as a sum of determinants @xcite , the dw partition function of the eight - vertex model with a non - diagonal reflection end can be represented as a single determinant",
    ". such a single determinant expression will be essential for the study of the bethe vectors of the open xyz chain with non - diagonal boundary terms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , after introducing our notation and some basic ingredients , we construct the four boundary states which specify the dw boundary condition of the eight - vertex model with a non - diagonal reflection end . in section 3 , using the vertex - face correspondence relation we express the dw boundary partition function in terms of the matrix element of the product of the ( face type ) pseudo - particle creation operators . in section 4 , with help of the f - matrix of the eight - vertex sos model",
    "we give the completely symmetric and polarization free representations of the pseudo - particle creation operators in the f - basis . in section 5 ,",
    "we obtain the determinant representation of the dw partition function . in section 6 ,",
