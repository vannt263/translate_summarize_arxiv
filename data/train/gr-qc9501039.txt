    "<S> we examine homogeneous but anisotropic cosmologies in scalar - tensor gravity theories , including brans - dicke gravity . we present a method for deriving solutions for any isotropic perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state ( @xmath0 ) in a spatially flat ( bianchi type  i ) cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> these models approach an isotropic , general relativistic solution as the expansion becomes dominated by the barotropic fluid . </S>",
    "<S> all models that approach general relativity isotropize except for the case of a maximally stiff fluid . for stiff fluid or radiation or in vacuum we are able to give solutions for arbitrary scalar - tensor theories in a number of anisotropic bianchi and kantowski - sachs metrics . </S>",
    "<S> we show how this approach can also be used to derive solutions from the low - energy string effective action . </S>",
