    "for a long time scattering a particle on one - dimensional ( 1d ) static potential barriers have been considered in quantum mechanics as a representative of well - understood phenomena . however , solving the so - called tunneling time problem ( ttp ) ( see reviews @xcite and references therein ) showed that this is not the case .    at present",
    "there is a variety of approaches to introduce characteristic times for a 1d scattering .",
    "they are the group ( wigner ) tunneling times ( more known as the `` phase '' tunneling times ) @xcite , different variants of the dwell time @xcite , the larmor time @xcite , and the concept of the time of arrival which is based on introducing either a suitable time operator ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or the positive operator valued measure ( see review @xcite ) .",
    "a particular class of approaches to study the temporal aspects of a 1d scattering includes the bohmian @xcite , feynman and wigner ones ( see @xcite as well as @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one has also point out the papers @xcite to study the characteristic times of `` the forerunner preceding the main tunneling signal of the wave created by a source with a sharp onset '' .    as is known ( see @xcite ) ,",
    "the main question of the ttp is that of the time spent , on the average , by a particle in the barrier region in the case of a completed scattering . setting this problem implies that the particle s source and detectors are located at a considerable distance from the potential barrier .",
    "the answer to this question , for a given potential and initial state of a particle , is evident must be unique . in particular , it must not depend on the details of measurements with the removed detectors .",
    "one has to recognize that the answer has not yet been found , and this elastic scattering process looks at present like an unexplained phenomenon surrounded by paradoxes .",
    "we bear in mind , in particular , 1 ) the lack of a causal relationship between the transmitted and incident wave packets @xcite ; 2 ) a superluminal propagation of a particle through opaque potential barriers ( the hartman effect ) @xcite ; 3 ) accelerating ( on the average ) a transmitted particle , in the asymptotic region , as compared with an incident one @xcite ; 4 ) aligning the average particle s spin with the magnetic field @xcite ; 5 ) the larmor precession of the reflected particles under the non - zero magnetic field localized beyond the barrier on the side of transmission @xcite .    at the first glance the bohmian mechanics provides an adequate description of the temporal aspects of a completed scattering ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for its `` causal '' one - particle trajectories exclude , a priory , the appearance of the above paradoxes .",
    "for example , the hartman effect does not appear in this approach : in the case of opaque rectangular barriers , the bohmian dwell time , unlike smith s and buttiker s dwell times , increases exponentially together with the barrier s width ( see also section [ a4 ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed however that the bohmian model of a 1d completed scattering is not free of paradoxes . as is well known",
    ", the region of location of the particle s source consists in this model from two parts separated by some critical point .",
    "this point is such that all particles starting from the sub - region , adjacent to the barrier region , are transmitted by the barrier ; otherwise they are reflected by it .",
    "that is , the subensembles of transmitted and reflected particles are macroscopically distinct in this model at all stages of scattering , what clearly contradicts the main principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "note , the position of the critical point depends on the barrier s shape . for a particle impinging the barrier from the left ,",
    "this point approaches the left boundary of the barrier when the latter becomes less transparent . otherwise , the critical point approaches minus infinity on the ox - axis .",
    "this property means , in fact , that particles feel the barrier s shape , being however far from the barrier region .",
    "of course , this fact evidences , too , that the existing `` causal '' trajectories of the bohmian mechanics give an improper description of the scattering process .    from our viewpoint , all difficulties and paradoxes to arise in studying the temporal aspects of a completed scattering result from the fact that setting this problem in the existing framework of quantum mechanics is contradictory . on the one hand ,",
    "in the case of a completed scattering an observer deals only either with transmitted or reflected particles , and , consequently , all one - particle observables must be introduced individually for each sub - process . on the other hand , quantum mechanics , as it stands ,",
    "does not imply the introduction of observables for the sub - processes , for its formalism does not provide the wave functions for transmission and reflection , needed for computing the expectation values of observables .",
    "so , in the case of a completed scattering , a conflicting situation arises already at the stage of setting the problem : the nature of this process requires a separate description of transmission and reflection ; while quantum mechanics , as it stands , does not allow such a description .",
    "this conflict underlies all controversy and paradoxes to arise in solving the ttp : in fact , in the existing framework of quantum theory , there are no observables which can be consistently introduced for this process .",
    "note , this concerns not only characteristic times but also all observables to have hermitian operators .",
    "for example , averaging the particle s position and momentum over the whole ensemble of particles does not give the expectation ( i.e. , most probable ) values of these quantities . as regards characteristic times",
    ", we have to stress once more that among the existing time concepts neither separate nor common times for transmission and reflection give the time spent by a particle in the barrier region . in the first case , there is no basis to distinguish ( theoretically and experimentally ) transmitted and reflected particles in the barrier region . in the second case , characteristic times introduced can not be properly interpreted ( see , e.g. , discussion of the dwell and larmor times in @xcite ) ; these times describe neither transmitted nor reflected particles ( ideal transmission and reflection are exceptional cases ) .    at the same time",
    "there is a viewpoint that all the time scales introduced for a completed scattering are valid : one has only to choose a suitable clock ( operational procedure ) for each of them .",
    "this viewpoint is based on the assumption that timing a quantum particle , without influencing the scattering process , is impossible in principle . by this viewpoint",
    "the time measured should always depend on the clock used for this purpose .",
    "however , quantum phenomena , such as a completed scattering , have their own , intrinsic spatial and temporal scales , and our main task is to learn to measure these scales without influencing their values . in this paper we show that for the problem under consideration this is possible .",
    "the above conflict can be resolved in the framework of conventional quantum mechanics , and characteristic times for transmission and reflection can be introduced .",
    "for measuring these time scales without affecting the scattering process , one can exploit the larmor precession of the particle s spin under the infinitesimal magnetic field .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in ( section [ a0 ] )",
    "we introduce the concept of combined and elementary quantum processes and states . by this concept , the state of the whole quantum ensemble of particles , at the problem at hand , is a combined one to represent a coherent superposition of two ( elementary ) states of the ( to - be-)transmitted and ( to - be-)reflected subensembles of particles . in section [ a2 ] we present two solutions to the schrdinger equation to describe transmission and reflection at all stages of scattering . on their basis",
    "we define the group , dwell and larmor times for transmission and reflection ( section [ a3 ] ) .",
    "for our purposes it is relevant to address the well - known schrodinger s cat paradox which displays explicitly a principal difference between macroscopically distinct quantum states and their superpositions .",
    "as is known , macroscopically distinct quantum states are symbolized in this paradox by the dead - cat and alive - cat ones . either may be associated with a single , really existing cat which can be described in terms of one - cat observables . as regards a superposition of these two states ,",
    "it can not be associated with a cat to exist really ( a cat can not be dead and alive simultaneously ) .",
    "to calculate the expectation values of one - cat observables for this state is evident to have no physical sense .",
    "as is known , quantum mechanics as it stands does not distinguish between the dead - cat and alive - cat states and their superposition .",
    "it postulates that all its rules should be equally applied to macroscopically distinct states and their superpositions . from our pint of view , the main lesson of the schrodinger s cat paradox is just that this postulate is erroneous .",
    "quantum mechanics must distinguish these two kinds of states on the conceptual level .",
    "hereinafter , any superposition of macroscopically distinct quantum states will be referred to as a combined quantum state .",
    "all quantum states , like the `` dead - cat '' and `` alive - cat '' ones , will be named here as elementary ones .",
    "thereby we emphasize that such states can not be presented as a superposition of macroscopically distinct states .",
    "note , the concepts of combined and elementary states are fully applicable to a 1d completed scattering . though we deal here with a microscopic object , at the final stage of scattering the states of the subensembles of transmitted and reflected particles",
    "are distinguished macroscopically . so that scattering a quantum particle on the potential barrier is a combined process .",
    "it consists from two alternative elementary one - particle sub - processes , transmission and reflection , evolved coherently .",
    "the main peculiarity of a time - dependent combined one - particle scattering state to describe the combination of the two elementary sub - processes is that 1 ) in the classical limit , such a state is associated with two one - particle trajectories , rather than with one ; 2 ) the squared modulus of such a state can not be interpreted as the probability density for one particle ; 3 ) for this state it is meaningless to calculate expectation values of one - particle observables , or to introduce one - particle characteristic times and trajectories .",
    "all the quantum - mechanical rules are applicable only to elementary states . neglecting this circumstance leads to paradoxes .",
    "it is useful also to note that one has to distinguish between the interference of different elementary states ( e.g. , the interference between the incident and reflected waves in the case of a non - ideal reflection ) and the self - interference of the same elementary state ( e.g. , the interference between the incident and reflected waves in the case of an ideal reflection ) . in the first case one deals with waves which are not connected causally . in the second case ,",
    "interfering waves are causally connected with each other .",
    "so , to explain properly a 1d completed scattering , we have to study the behavior of the subensembles of transmitted and reflected particles at all stages of scattering . at the first glance ,",
    "this programm is impracticable in principle , since quantum mechanics , as it stands , does not give the way of reconstructing the prehistory of these subensembles by their final states .",
    "however , as will be shown below ( see also @xcite ) , quantum mechanics implies such a reconstruction : we found two solutions to the schrodinger equation , which describe both the sub - processes at all stages of scattering . either consists from one incoming and only one outgoing ( transmitted or reflected ) wave .",
    "thus , though it is meaningless to say about to - be - transmitted or to - be - reflected particles , the notions of to - be - transmitted and to - be - reflected subensembles of particles are meaningful .",
    "let us consider a particle incident from the left on the static potential barrier @xmath0 confined to the finite spatial interval @xmath1 $ ] @xmath2 ; @xmath3 is the barrier width .",
    "let its in - state , @xmath4 at @xmath5 be a normalized function to belong to the set @xmath6 consisting from infinitely differentiable functions vanishing exponentially in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "the fourier - transform of such functions are known to belong to the set @xmath8 too . in this case the position , @xmath9 and momentum , @xmath10 operators both are well - defined . without loss of generality we will suppose that @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the wave - packet s half - width at @xmath5 ( @xmath13 ) .    we consider a completed scattering .",
    "this means that the average velocity , @xmath14 is large enough , so that the transmitted and reflected wave packets do not overlap each other at late times . as for the rest",
    ", the relation of the average energy of a particle to the barrier s height may be any by value .",
    "we begin our analysis with the derivation of expressions for the incident , transmitted and reflected wave packets to describe , in the problem at hand , the whole ensemble of particles . for this purpose we will use the variant ( see @xcite ) of the well - known transfer matrix method @xcite .",
    "let the wave function @xmath15 to describe the stationary state of a particle in the out - of - barrier regions be written in the form @xmath16 @xmath17 here @xmath18 @xmath19 is the energy of a particle ; @xmath20 is its mass .",
    "the coefficients entering this solution are connected by the transfer matrix @xmath21 : @xmath22    @xmath23,\\nonumber\\\\ p=\\sqrt{\\frac{r(k)}{t(k)}}\\exp\\left[i\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+ f(k)-ks\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the real tunneling parameters : @xmath27 ( the transmission coefficient ) and @xmath28 ( phase ) are even and odd functions of @xmath29 , respectively ; @xmath30 ; @xmath31 ; @xmath32 .",
    "we will suppose that the tunneling parameters have already been calculated .    in the case of many - barrier structures",

    "our next step is to show that only one root of @xmath74 gives a searched - for @xmath75 for this purpose the above solution should be extended into the region @xmath76 . to do this",
    ", we will restrict ourselves by symmetric potential barriers , though the above derivation is valid for all barriers .",
    "let @xmath0 be such that @xmath77 @xmath78 as is known , for the region of a symmetric potential barrier , one can always find odd , @xmath79 , and even , @xmath80 , solutions to the schrdinger equation .",
    "we will suppose here that these functions are known .",
    "for example , for the rectangular potential barrier ( see exps .",
    "( [ 501 ] ) and ( [ 502 ] ) ) , @xmath81 @xmath82 note , @xmath83 is a constant , which equals @xmath84 in the case of the rectangular barrier . without loss of generality",

    "then , one can show that `` sewing '' the general solution @xmath63 in the barrier region together with exp .",

    "indeed , as is seen from exp .",
    "( [ 3000 ] ) , @xmath107 for all values of @xmath29 . in this case",
    "the probability flux , for any time - dependent wave function formed from @xmath63 , is equal to zero at the barrier s midpoint for any value of time .",
    "this means that reflected particles impinging the symmetric barrier from the left do not enter the region @xmath108 .",
    "thus , @xmath109 for @xmath108 . in the region",
    "@xmath110 it is described by exps .",

    ", one can easily show that @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 where @xmath114 like @xmath58 the twf is everywhere continuous and the corresponding probability flux is everywhere constant ( we have to stress once more that this flux has no discontinuity at the point @xmath115 , though the first derivative of @xmath65 on @xmath116 is discontinuous at this point ) . as in the case of the rwf , wave packets formed from @xmath65 should evolve in time with a constant norm .",
    "so , for any value of @xmath52 @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the average transmission and reflection coefficients , respectively . besides , @xmath120 from this it follows , in particular , that the scalar product of the wave functions for transmission and reflection , @xmath121 is a purely imagine quantity to approach zero when @xmath122 .",
    "now we are ready to proceed to the study of temporal aspects of a 1d completed scattering .",
    "the wave functions for transmission and reflection presented in the previous section permit us to introduce characteristic times for either sub - process .",
    "our main aim is to find , for each sub - process , the time spent , on the average , by a particle in the barrier region . in doing so , we have to bear in mind that there may be different approximations of this quantity . however , we have to remind that its true value must not depend , for a completed scattering , on the choice of `` clocks '' .",
    "measuring the tunneling time , under such conditions , implies that a particle has its own , internal `` clock '' to remember the time spent by the particle in the spatial region investigated .",
    "this means that the only way to measure the tunneling time for a completed scattering is to exploit the internal degrees of freedom of quantum particles .",
    "as is known , namely this idea underlies the larmor - time concept based on the larmor precession of the particle s spin under the infinitesimal magnetic field .    in the above context",
    ", the concepts of the group and dwell times are rather auxiliary ones , since they can not be verified",
    ". nevertheless , they may be useful for a better understanding of the scattering process .",
    "we begin our analysis from the group time concept to give the time spent by the wave - packet s cm in the spatial regions . in other words , both for transmitted and reflected particles , we begin with timing `` mean - statistical particles '' of these subensembles ( their motion is described by the ehrenfest equations ) .",
    "in doing so , we will distinguish exact and asymptotic group times .",
    "let @xmath123 and @xmath124 be such moments of time that @xmath125 @xmath126 then , one can define the transmission time @xmath127 as the difference @xmath128 where @xmath123 is the smallest root of eq .",
    "( [ 80 ] ) , and @xmath124 is the largest root of eq .",
    "( [ 81 ] ) .",
    "similarly , for reflection , let @xmath129 and @xmath130 be such values of @xmath52 that @xmath131 then the exact group time for reflection , @xmath132 is @xmath133    of course , a serious shortcoming of the exact characteristic times is that they fit only for sufficiently narrow ( in @xmath116-space ) wave packets . for wide packets these times give a very rough estimation of the time spent by a particle in the barrier region .",
    "for example , one may a priory say that the exact group time for reflection , for a sufficiently narrow potential barrier and/or wide wave packet , should be equal to zero . in this case",
    ", the wave - packet s cm does not enter the barrier region .",
    "note , the potential barrier influences a particle not only when its most probable position is in the barrier region . for a completed scattering",
    "it is useful also to introduce asymptotic group times to describe the passage of the particle in the sufficiently large spatial interval @xmath134;$ ] where @xmath135    it is evident that in this case , instead of the exact wave functions for transmission and reflection , we may use the corresponding in- and out - asymptotes derived in @xmath29-representation .",

    "( [ 4005 ] ) and ( [ 40014 ] ) , unlike smith s , buttiker s and bohmian dwell times , are defined in terms of the twf and rwf .",
    "as will be seen from the following , the dwell times introduced can be justified in the framework of the larmor - time concept .",
    "as was said above , both the group and dwell time concepts do not give the way of measuring the time spent by a particle in the barrier region .",
    "this task can be solved in the framework of the larmor time concept . as is known ,",
    "the idea to use the larmor precession as clocks was proposed by baz @xcite and developed later by rybachenko @xcite and bttiker @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however the known concept of larmor time has a serious shortcoming .",
    "it was introduced in terms of asymptotic values ( see @xcite ) . in this connection ,",
    "our next step is to define the larmor times for transmission and reflection , taking into account the expressions for the corresponding wave functions in the barrier region .",
    "let us consider the quantum ensemble of electrons moving along the @xmath116-axis and interacting with the symmetrical time - independent potential barrier @xmath0 and small magnetic field ( parallel to the @xmath219-axis ) confined to the finite spatial interval @xmath1.$ ] let this ensemble be a mixture of two parts .",

    "the potential barrier effectively decreases ( increases ) , in height , by the value @xmath226 ; here @xmath227 is the frequency of the larmor precession ; @xmath228 @xmath229 denotes the magnetic moment .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian has the following form , @xmath230;\\nonumber\\\\ \\hat{h}=\\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2 m } , { \\mbox{\\hspace{3mm}}}otherwise.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath231 , due to the influence of the magnetic field , the states of particles with spin up and down become different .",
    "the probability to pass the barrier is different for them .",
    "let for any value of @xmath52 the spinor to describe the state of particles read as @xmath232    in accordance with ( [ 261 ] ) , either spinor component can be uniquely presented as a coherent superposition of two probability fields to describe transmission and reflection : @xmath233 note that @xmath234 for @xmath108 . as a consequence ,",
    "the same decomposition takes place for spinor ( [ 9002 ] ) : @xmath235    we will suppose that all the wave functions for transmission and reflection are known .",
    "it is important to stress here ( see ( [ 700100 ] ) that @xmath236 @xmath237 and @xmath238 are the ( real ) transmission and reflection coefficients , respectively , for particles with spin up @xmath239 and down @xmath240 .",
    "let further @xmath241 and @xmath242 be quantities to describe all particles .",
    "to study the time evolution of the average particle s spin , we have to find the expectation values of the spin projections @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",

    "possess a nonzero average @xmath219-component of spin ( though it equals zero for the whole ensemble of particles , for the case considered ) to be conserved in the course of scattering . by our approach",
    "it is meaningless to use the angles @xmath261 and @xmath262 as a measure of the time spent by a particle in the barrier region .",
    "as in @xcite , we will suppose further that the applied magnetic field is infinitesimal . in order to introduce characteristic times",

    "as is supposed in our setting the problem , both at the initial and final instants of time , a particle does not interact with the potential barrier and magnetic field . in this case , without loss of exactness , the angles of rotation ( @xmath277 and @xmath278 ) of spin under the magnetic field , in the course of a completed scattering , can be written in the form , @xmath279 on the other hand , both the quantities can be written in the form : @xmath280 and @xmath281 where @xmath282 and @xmath283 are the larmor times for transmission and reflection . comparing these expressions with ( [ 90020 ] ) , we eventually obtain @xmath284 these are just the searched - for definitions of the larmor times for transmission and reflection .",
    "as is seen , if the state of a particle is described by a normalized wave function @xmath285 , then the time @xmath286 spent by the particle in the barrier region is @xmath287 this definition is just that introduced in @xcite ) on the basis of classical mechanics ( see also @xcite ) ; note that in both cases the integrals are calculated over the whole completed scattering .",
    "thus , on the one hand , our approach justifies the definition ( b2 ) , since this expression is obtained now as the larmor time . as a consequence",

    ".    thus , the larmor times for transmission and reflection are , like the local dwell time ( see @xcite ) , the average values of the corresponding dwell times .    in the end of this section",
    "it is useful again to address rectangular barriers . for the stationary case , in addition to larmor times ( [ 4007 ] ) ,",
    "( [ 4009 ] ) , ( [ 40030 ] ) and ( [ 40031 ] ) ) , we present explicit expressions for the initial angles @xmath261 and @xmath303 . to the first order in @xmath227",

    "note that @xmath310 is just the characteristic time introduced in @xcite ( see exp .",
    "( 2.20a ) ) .",
    "however , we have to stress once more that this quantity does not describe the duration of the scattering process ( see the end of section [ a332 ] ) . as regards @xmath311 this quantity",
    "is directly associated with timing a particle in the barrier region .",
    "it describes the initial position of the `` clock - pointers '' , which they have before entering this region .",
    "let us now show that the case of tunneling a particle , with a well defined energy , through an opaque rectangular potential barrier is the most suitable one to verify our approach .",
    "let us denote the measured azimuthal angle as @xmath312 by our approach @xmath313 .",
    "that is , the final time to be registered by the particle s `` clocks '' should be equal to @xmath314    as is seen , in the general case there is a problem to distinguish the inputs @xmath315 and @xmath316 however , for a particle tunneling through an opaque rectangular barrier this problem disappears .",
    "the point is that for @xmath317 @xmath318 ( see exps .",
    "( [ 4007 ] ) and ( [ 90028 ] ) ) .",
    "note , in the case considered , smith s dwell time ( @xmath319 ) , which coincides with the `` phase '' time , and buttiker s dwell time ( see exps . ( 3.2 ) and ( 2.20b ) in @xcite ) saturate with increasing the barrier s width .",
    "just this property of the tunneling times is interpreted as the hartman effect . at the same time",
    ", our approach denies the existence of the hartman effect : transmission time ( [ 4007 ] ) increases exponentially when @xmath320    note that the bohmian approach formally denies this effect , too .",
    "it predicts that the time , @xmath321 spent by a transmitted particle in the opaque rectangular barrier is @xmath322.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , for @xmath189 we have @xmath323 i.e. , @xmath324    as is seen , in comparison with our definition , @xmath325 overestimates the duration of dwelling transmitted particles in the barrier region . in the final analysis ,",
    "this sharp difference between @xmath325 and @xmath207 is explained by the fact that @xmath326 to describe transmission was obtained in terms of @xmath327 one can show that the input of the to - be - reflected subensemble of particles into @xmath328 dominates inside the region of an opaque potential barrier . therefore treating this time scale as a characteristic time for transmission has no basis .    as was said ( see sections [ ai ] and [ a0 ] ) , the trajectories of transmitted and reflected particles are ill - defined in the bohmian mechanics .",
    "however , we have to stress that our approach does not at all deny the bohmian one .",
    "it suggests only that causal trajectories for these particles should be redefined .",
    "an incident particle should have two possibility ( to be transmitted or to reflected by the barrier ) irrespective of the location of its starting point .",
    "this means that just two causal trajectories should evolve from each staring point : on the @xmath329-axis one should lead to plus infinity , but another should approach minus infinity . both sets of causal trajectories must be defined on the basis of @xmath288 and @xmath330 as to the rest , all mathematical tools developed in the bohmian mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) remain in force .    tunneling is useful also to display explicitly the role of the exact and asymptotic group times .",
    "fig.1 shows the time dependence of the mean value of the particle s position for transmission , where @xmath331 , @xmath332 , @xmath333 . at @xmath5",
    "the ( full ) state of the particle is described by the gaussian wave packet peaked around @xmath334 ; its half - width @xmath335 ; the average energy of the particle @xmath336 .    as is seen",
    ", the exact group time gives the time spent by the cm of the transmitted wave packet in the barrier region .",
    "but the asymptotic time displays its lag , long after the scattering event , with respect to the cm of a packet , to start from the point @xmath144 and move freely with the velocity @xmath337 .    in this case",
    "the exact group transmission time is equal approximately to @xmath338 , the asymptotic one is of @xmath339 , and @xmath340 .",
    "as is seen , the dwell and exact group times for transmission , both evidence that , though the asymptotic group time for transmission is small for this case , transmitted particles spend much time in the barrier region .",
    "note , also that the times spent by transmitted and reflected particles in the barrier region do not coincide even for symmetric barriers .",
    "it is shown that a 1d completed scattering is a combination of two sub - processes , transmission and reflection , evolved coherently . in the case of symmetric potential barrier",
    "we find explicitly two solutions to the schrdinger equation , which describe these sub - processes at all stages of scattering .",
    "their sum gives the wave function to describe the whole combined process .    on the basis of these solutions , for either sub - process",
    ", we define the time spent , on the average , by a particle in the barrier region . for this purpose",
    "we reconsider the well - known group , dwell and larmor - time concepts .",
    "the group time concept is suitable for timing a particle in a well - localized state , when the width of a wave packet is smaller than the barrier s width .",
    "the dwell time concept is introduced for timing a particle in the stationary state .",
    "the larmor `` clock '' is the most universal instrument for timing the motion of transmitted and reflected particles , without influence on the scattering event .",
    "it is applicable for any wave packets .",
    "we found that the larmor times for transmission and reflection are the average values of the corresponding dwell times .",

    "<S> thus , firstly , we justify the known definition of the local dwell time introduced by hauge and co - workers as well by leavens and aers , for now this time can be measured ; secondly , we confirm that namely buttiker s dwell time gives the energy - distribution for the tunneling time ; thirdly , we state that all the definitions are valid only if they are based on the wave functions for transmission and reflection found in our paper . </S>",
    "<S> besides , we define the exact and asymptotic group times to be auxiliary in timing the scattering process . </S>"
