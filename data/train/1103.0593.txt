    "extensive optical photometry of the comet near opposition @xcite also indicate a dominance of grains in the coma larger than 0.1  .",
    "thus , the results derived from the scattered light and the thermal emission spectra are consistent , and the porosity of grains from our thermal models ( @xmath128% for @xmath129  ) suggests that the coma of comet c/2007  n3  ( lulin ) is composed of grains with properties more like bpca grains rather than bcca grains .    negative polarization was not observed in the nir in comet c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) whose dust was characterized by small particles .",
    "disappearance of the negative polarization in this instance signals that at wavelengths @xmath130  , the size parameter of the dust particles became smaller than the wavelength ( rayleigh particles ) for which polarization is always positive .",
    "this is not the case observed in comet c/2007 ( n3 ) lulin .",
    "the genesis of negative polarization is complex ( for a detailed discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "it results from a combination of properties of individual monomers , multiple scattering , coherent backscattering and near - field effects . at some monomer sizes these latter effects , combined with porosity and refractive indices ,",
    "tend to produce effects that work in the same direction increasing the negative polarization , but at other monomer sizes they produce opposite effects .",
    "this is why one can get equal negative polarization for different types of aggregates or a big change in negative polarization for a small change of , for example , the size parameter of the monomer @xcite .",
    "computation of negative polarization is still a modeling challenge deserving future attention .    in our analysis of comet",
    "c/2007 n3 ( lulin ) , we claim that the negative polarization does not contradict conclusions regarding the particle properties inferred the red polarization color ( from the @xmath0-band through the @xmath3-band ) and those derived from the thermal ir observations that indicate the grains are large ( i.e. , micron - sized or larger ) and of low porosity ( perhaps as compact as an aggregate of submicron particles can be ) .",
    "another explanation for the negative polarization observed in the coma of comet c/2007 n3 ( lulin ) is that the dust was composed of transparent silicate particles with little or no carbon content .",
    "however , cometary dust is usually characterized by a low albedo that presumes a large content of carbon , and photometrically c/2007 n3 ( lulin ) does not show any peculiarity that would allow us to suppose that its albedo is significantly different .",
    "also , in the case of abundant silicate particles , we would expect a noticeable spectral dependence of polarization @xcite .",
    "in addition , our thermal model has a silicate to carbon ratio of 0.48 , inconsistent with dust dominated by transparent silicates .",
    "we have found that c/2007 n3 ( lulin ) clearly has a typical optical negative branch in the polarization as well as exhibiting a negative branch in the near - infrared at low phase angles . when compact aggregates are larger than the longest wavelength considered it is known that the depth of the negative branch does not depend significantly on the wavelength ; furthermore , the wavelength dependence becomes less pronounced as the phase angle decreases @xcite .",
    "we have also found that these large , low - porosity aggregates in comet c/2007 n3 ( lulin ) are consistent with the thermal infrared measurements that showed a very weak silicate feature .",
    "our thermal model contains moderately porous grains ( @xmath131 ) , with a peak grain size of @xmath132 .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the large aggregate grains needed to explain the polarimetry if the monomers are @xmath133   in size .",
    "we conclude that the dust in comet c/2007 n3 ( lulin ) is dominated by large and compact aggregate particles , made up of thousands of small monomers .",
    "compact aggregates are typical for old periodic comets @xcite but not for new ones , which tend to have more porous aggregates .",
    "however , @xcite show that the dust properties of some nearly - isotropic ( including oort cloud comets ) and ecliptic comets are similar based on intercomparison of the strength of the 10   silicate feature versus the color temperature of the dust .",
    "our polarimetry of comet c/2007 n3 ( lulin ) , an oort cloud comet with thermal emission properties equivalent to ecliptic - family comets , demonstrate that grain structure may account for this observation ( see fig .  4 of * ?",
    "the occurrence of a negative branch in the polarization in the near - infrared is likely typical for most comets .",
    "o1 ( hale - bopp ) , which showed no negative branch in the near - infrared , must be considered an anomalous case due to the production of significant numbers of very small , submicron grains .",
    "these latter small coma grains could be individual monomers that have broken off from the larger , porous aggregates . for c/2007 n3 ( lulin )",
    ", the more compact aggregates must maintain most of their integrity after release from the nucleus .",
    "although aggregate models for the polarization and the large porous grain model for the thermal emission of comet c/2007 n3 ( lulin ) share qualitative features , a rigorous quantitative grain / grain - aggregate model that is self consistent for both scattering and emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has yet to be applied to observations of individual comets .",
    "such an effort will be an important future work .",
