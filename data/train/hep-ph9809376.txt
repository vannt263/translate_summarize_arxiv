    "a neutrino transition magnetic moment can account , both for the observed deficiency of the solar neutrino flux and the time variations of the signal .",
    "the overall deficit is caused by the alteration or suppression of the neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "the time dependence may be caused by time variations of the magnetic field in the convective zone of the sun . as it has been shown in @xcite ,",
    "magnetic moments solutions are not ruled out by present experimental data ; that is valid for both , absolute deficits and time variations of the observed solar neutrino flux .    in transverse magnetic fields ,",
    "neutrinos with transition magnetic moments will experience spin and flavour rotation simultaneously ( resonant spin - flavour precession , rsfp ) .",
    "the observation of electron antineutrinos from the sun would lead to the conclusion that the neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "there are however stringent bounds on the presence of solar electron antineutrinos coming from the high energy boron neutrinos ( @xmath9 @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic fields measured on the surface of the sun are weaker than within the interior of the convective zone .",
    "the mean field value over the solar disc is of the order of 1 g and in the solar spots magnetic field strength reaches @xmath10 kg . in magnetic hydrodynamics ( mhd )",
    "one can explain such fields in a self - consistent way if these fields are generated by dynamo mechanism at the bottom of the convective zone . in this region the strength of small scale regular magnetic fields could reach a value of 100 kg .",
    "these fields propagate through the convective zone and photosphere decreasing in the strength value while increasing in the scale giving traces in from of loops in bipolar active regions ( solar spots ) .",
    "large - scale toroidal magnetic field created by dynamo mechanism in convective zone has strength even less than small - scale r.m.s fields near the bottom of convective zone .",
    "this is the main reason why one should consider neutrino propagation in the random magnetic field of the sun .",
    "the ratio of the r.m.s . random field and the regular ( toroidal ) field may be @xmath11 20 - 50 , therefore the problem of rsfp neutrino propagation in noisy magnetic field seems to be important .",
    "estimations for the ratio of rms fields to regular field are necessarily very rough . in textbooks",
    "@xcite we find the conservative ratio @xmath12 in more elaborate models the ratio of magnetic energy densities is given by the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath13 which may be much bigger than unity for plasma with large conductivity . here @xmath14 is a topology index @xcite .    the effect of random magnetic fields in rsfp solutions to the snp and antineutrino production has been explored previously for simplified models @xcite . in this work",
    "we will deal with the complete problem , we will present calculations of neutrino spin flavour conversions in presence of matter and magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field will have two ingredients .",
    "the first ingredient will be a a theoretically motivated solar magnetic field profile .",
    "this magnetic field , which is one solution to the static magnetic hydrodynamic equations , is in addition a twisting field .",
    "the degree of twisting , the transversal profile and the ratio core field/ convection field are functionally related under this model . of all possible solutions , in practical calculations",
    "we have considered only the solution with minimum twist which is at the same time the solution which implies a minimum value for the central field ( a factor @xmath15 or less of the magnetic field at the convective zone ) . as a second ingredient ,",
    "the effect of a layer of magnetic noise generated at the bottom of the convective zone has been included , we have justified that the level of noise in this region can be certainly very high .",
    "notice that an analogous problem but without the regular twist field motivated here while with use of a direct numerical method for dealing with the random magnetic fields in the solar convective zone has been recently considered ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite are in general consistent with those obtained in the present work ( see conclusions below ) .",
    "in section ( 2 ) we present the effective hamiltonian governing the evolution of the 4x4 neutrino wave function ( two flavors times two helicities ) in presence of a generic magnetic field . in section ( 3.1 )",
    "we give some physical arguments supporting the idea that r.m.s fields could be indeed important in the solar convective region .",
    "the analytical expressions for the hydrodynamic - inspired regular large - scale magnetic field appear in section ( 3.2 ) .",
    "there we show how different configurations of this field can be classified according to its intrinsic  twist  in the perpendicular plane to neutrino propagation . in section ( 4 ) we give the master equation governing the time evolution of the averaged density matrix in presence of the random magnetic field .",
    "we show analytically how in the limit where chaotic field dominates , the 4x4 evolution equations decouples and the averaged transition probabilities follow a markovian process .",
    "the results of the numerical integration of the exact averaged master equation are shown and discussed in sections ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . from the calculated transition probabilities the expected total signals in each of the existing experiments (",
    "sk , sage - gallex , homestake ) are obtained and @xmath16-allowed parameter regions .",
    "in addition the expected electron antineutrino signal in sk is calculated and compared with existing bounds .",
    "there are two channels for @xmath17-conversions corresponding to the cascades : ( i ) @xmath0 or ( ii ) @xmath18 .",
    "the former case realizes if we assume a zero field in the radiative zone and in the core or if we exclude right - handed neutrino production there and the msw - conversion ( @xmath19 ) takes place before neutrino reaches convective zone . the latter case ( ii )",
    "realizes when a strong magnetic field is present both in the radiative zone and in the solar core . in this case",
    "the rsfp takes place before the msw - conversion since the @xmath20 energy splitting @xmath21 is less than for the msw one ( @xmath22 ) at the same point @xmath23 .",
    "this is true for the typical admixture of helium and heavy elements considered to be present in the inner layers of the sun .",
    "we consider conversions @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 , ( for definiteness we will refer to @xmath27 for the rest of this work ) for two neutrino flavors obeying the master evolution equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the neutrino mixing parameters ; @xmath32 is the neutrino active - active transition magnetic moment ; @xmath33 is the magnetic field component which is perpendicular to the neutrino trajectory in the sun ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the neutrino vector potentials for @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the sun given by the abundances of the electron ( @xmath38 ) and neutron ( @xmath39 ) components and by the ssm density profile @xcite @xmath40    the transverse magnetic field @xmath41 appearing in eq.([e7701 ] ) is given by the following expression where cartesian and polar coordinates are written explicitly : @xmath42 where @xmath43 the cartesian form is useful in writing the averaged master equation . the polar form is the most convenient in separating out the twisting part",
