    "it is well know that de broglie did not accept the interpretation of quantum mechanics given by the copenhagen school of bohr and heisenberg .",
    "de broglie was particulary convinced that a coherent formulation of quantum mechanics should includes the description of a dynamical structure at the fundamental level . in this context",
    "the problem of the locality and non locality in quantum mechanics in connection with the einstein podolsky rosen @xcite paradox represented certainly for him a serious challenge . in 1976",
    "g.  lochak , collaborator of l.   de broglie , published in the journal foundation of physics @xcite an argument against the j.  s.  bell theorem @xcite concerning local hidden - variables theories .",
    "this refutation was commented briefly by bell @xcite saying that it may have a mistake in the reasoning of lochak since the derivation in @xcite identifies clearly the necessity of non locality in any hidden variables models . in the words of bell `` _ _ it may be that lochak has in mind some other extension of de broglie s theory , to the more - than - one - particle system , than the straightforward generalization from 3 to 3n that i considered .",
    "but if this extension is local it will not agree with quantum mechanics and if it agrees with quantum mechanics it will not be local _ _ '' . in the past and",
    "recently lochak defended his point of view in various articles @xcite and a book @xcite .",
    "additionally lochak explained to me that de broglie agreed strongly with his reasoning ( this is confirmed in @xcite ) . because of that , and because of the importance of the de broglie conceptions in the quest of a self consistent hidden variable theory",
    ", i think that it is necessary to reexamine the thought of lochak and de broglie at that time .",
    "i want to show in this manuscript ( written in 2004 but never published ) the origin of the problem by pointing out different mistakes in the analysis by george lochak . beside its historical interest ,",
    "the ( secret ) motivation of this work is , as say to me my mother many times when i was a child , `` to clean the room before building up something new '' .",
    "the main idea of @xcite is that there is in bell s reasoning an hidden statistical assumption which is independent of the locality condition . indeed , according to bell the locality condition means that there is an hidden variable @xmath0 used to calculate all the different measured quantities .",
    "following bell this hidden variable must be the initial parameter(s ) defining the complete motion of the system , i.  e.  considered a long time before that the measurement occurs .",
    "lochak questions this last part of the bell definition .",
    "can we really use such parameters when calculating experimental quantities ?",
    "lochak answers by the negative and his argumentation runs as follow :    suppose an atomic wave packet propagating along the @xmath1 axis and directed on a stern and gerlach device such as the one represented on fig .  1 .",
    "a long time before its interaction with the magnetic field , the initial state is characterized by its wave function that we suppose to be @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "here we consider only a spin @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to the two states of the spin along @xmath5 . if the magnetic field is aligned with @xmath5 the atomic wave packet is separated into two parts with amplitudes proportional to @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "reproducing several times the same experiment shows naturally that the probability of finding the atom in one of the two exits is proportional to @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively . similarly changing",
    "the direction @xmath10 of the magnetic field implies that the numbers of particles detected in the two exits become proportional to one or the other of the two coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 calculated in the new basis @xmath13 . due to the fact that the spin observable is two valued",
    "we will write in the following @xmath14 the single particle probabilities involved ( @xmath15 are the eigenvalue of the projection operator @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are pauli s matrixes ) .    . prior to enter in the region of the magnetic field the atom moves along the axis z. after the interaction the particle is located in one or the other of the two exits corresponding to the two states of the atomic spin along a ) the axis @xmath10 or b ) the axis @xmath19.,width=10 ]    consider now the hidden variable hypothesis as defined by bell . in the context of deterministic hidden variable theories ,",
    "the probability of finding an atom in one of the two exit doors of a stern and gerlach beam splitter is given by @xmath20 here , following bell , @xmath21 is associated with the initial coordinates of the system and we accepted the locality condition @xmath22 imposing that the initial state is independent of the measurement settings .",
    "g.  lochak wrote equivalently @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a sub - ensemble of the hidden variable space associated with the value @xmath15 taken by the observable .",
    "such notation is evident if the system follows a well defined trajectory imposing @xmath25 ( which by definition of the symbol of kronecker can only have the two values 0 or 1 depending on @xmath0 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "this is clearly connected to the hypothesis that the observable @xmath26 must be , as in the de broglie model , functions of the initial coordinates .",
    "naturally for another orientation of the magnetic field we have @xmath27 now comes the paradox enounced by lochak : considering the ensembles intersection @xmath28 allow us to define the probability @xmath29 i.  e.   @xmath30 which is identified in @xcite with the probability of observing @xmath15 and @xmath31 with the same particle@xcite . but quantum mechanics prevents to measure with the same particle values associated to non - commutative observable . as a consequence , the assumption that an unique @xmath32 exists is erroneous and we must introduce two contextual distributions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this is in contradiction with the premisses and we must conclude , if we accept the reasoning of lochak , that the definition of bell @xcite is already unadapted for the description of a single spin measurement . in the words of lochak `` _ _ so it was perfectly legitimate and even evident that the initial probability distribution @xmath35 does not depend on @xmath10 ( or on @xmath36 ) , but this distribution is not and can not be the one that we need for the statistics of measurement results : we can be sure of this assertion precisely because , if we adopt this initial density @xmath35 , we obtain a traditional statistical pattern on measurement results , which obviously contradicts the well - known and certainly true statistical results in quantum mechanics _ _ '' .",
    "the question that we ask immediately is naturally `` and what about non locality ?",
    "does it means that any hidden variable model is necessary non local as seems to impose to conclude the precedent reasoning ? is a single particle measurement also non local ? ''",
    "the answer given by lochak is that non locality is not necessary involved for explaining the experimental results . in order to prove that lochak analyzed the concrete examples of the l.  de broglie and d.  bohm models",
    "@xcite which , in the single particle case , are equivalent and completely local . in these models a neutral single particle with spin @xmath3 , which is represented by a wave packet having two components @xmath37",
    "can be described dynamically as a point like object moving with the velocity @xmath38\\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right)$ ] . here",
    "@xmath39\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath40 define the probability current and probability density respectively , and @xmath41 are the phases of @xmath42 . in presence of a magnetic field",
    "the two contributions are oriented in one or the other of the exits @xcite , separating the trajectories associated with the two states @xmath43 and @xmath44 . naturally , as explained before",
    ", any modifications of the magnetic field orientation change the analyzed basis @xmath4 .",
    "consequently in presence of the stern and gerlach apparatus analyzing the spin components along @xmath10 and @xmath45 the density of probability @xmath46 depends explicitly on the orientation of the magnetic field and must be written @xmath47 . in this model",
    "we can define an instantaneous spin vector @xmath48 the projection @xmath49 spans a continuum of values during the interaction with the magnetic field but at end of the measure ( i.  e.  at @xmath50 ) we have @xmath51 corresponding to the spin observable @xmath52 .",
    "we can naturally define the mean value of the spin projection @xmath53 by @xmath54 in the de broglie theory @xcite the actual position of the particle is an hidden variable .",
    "if we choose to identify the hidden parameter @xmath0 used by bell with the coordinates of the particle in the wave packet at @xmath55 then we can justify eqs .  1,2,3 , with eq .",
    "10 but in order to do that we must use the contextual distributions @xmath33 instead of the unique @xmath32 postulated in @xcite by bell .",
    "the statistical hypothesis of bell is , following @xcite , consequently invalidated but the locality is nevertheless preserved . at that point",
    "it is important to make a break and to consider the problem of the locality for a single atom in the context of the de broglie - bohm theory .",
    "this point is fundamental because lochak did nt insisted sufficiently on it in @xcite . at the beginning of @xcite",
    "we can read that the postulate of locality `` which will not study further in this paper '' is not a part of the argumentation .",
    "however this postulate is clearly accepted by lochak as seen in particular in the sentence `` there is obviously no reason to suppose any dependance of [ the initial ] distribution on any future measurement '' , and in `` so it was then perfectly legitimate and even evident to suppose that the initial probability dsitribution @xmath35 does not depend on @xmath10 ( or on @xmath36 ) '' , and again in his discussion with despagnat @xcite .",
    "we accepted as a fact that the model proposed by de broglie is local but this need to be verified since in general the motion of the particle is affected by a quantum potential taking into account the wave function @xcite .",
    "this problem is discussed in @xcite . clearly",
    "any modifications of the boundary conditions or of the magnetic fields during the motion of the atomic wave packet will disturb the wave function .",
    "such perturbation propagates into the direction of the particle and affects the motion later on .",
    "there is then effectively no spontaneous action at distance . in the present case",
    "the two spatial regions occupied by the wave packet and the magnetic field respectively are well separated at a given time @xmath56 prior to the measurement .",
    "any instantaneous changes of the orientation of the stern and gerlach device at @xmath56 can generate , in principle , a weak electromagnetic impulsion propagating in the direction of the atomic wave packet ( a causal signal ) .",
    "the modification of the motion of the particle by this signal can only occur a time @xmath57 after that the change in the measuring device is done ( @xmath58 is the coordinate of the beam splitter on the @xmath1 axis , @xmath59 is the coordinate of the atomic wave packet at @xmath60 ) .",
    "this is particulary clear if we consider that the time evolution of the quantum system is determined by the interaction hamiltonian which is proportional to the local value of the magnetic field @xmath61 at the wave packet position : @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the atomic mass and @xmath64 the magnetic moment ) .",
    "there is then clearly a local dynamic in this problem and the implicit postulate of lochak is consequently completely pertinent .",
    "what is the conclusion of lochak ?",
    "we saw at a first stage i ) that the definition given by bell of @xmath35 implies paradoxes already for the single particle problem .",
    "this reasoning shows that the definition used by bell imposes the existence of joint probabilities for non commutating observable in contradiction with the basic rules of quantum mechanics . at a second stage ii )",
    "we saw that the model of de broglie , which is local when limited to a single particle , can explain the result of the single spin experiment .",
    "this proves , if we accept the reasoning of lochak , that the density of probability @xmath65 can depend on @xmath10 without introducing nonlocality in the hidden variable model . analyzing the de broglie model lochak found the explanation : the variables @xmath0",
    "are not the initial coordinates of the particle but the actual values @xmath66 of these coordinates at the time @xmath67 of the measurement",
    ".    let go back now to the original two particles problem proposed by bohm .",
    "two correlated atoms with spin @xmath3 are oriented on two settings of stern and gerlach devices @xmath68 located apart from each other .",
    "quantum mechanics allows us to define coincidence probabilities such as @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the eigenvalues of the spin projection operator along @xmath10 of the first atom and similarly @xmath71 are the eigenvalues of the spin projection operator along @xmath36 of the second atom . using the hidden variables definition given by bell and applying the locality condition we write the coincidence probabilities @xmath72 but",
    "now we can repeat the analysis done for the single spin measurement and define the probabilities @xmath73 and @xmath74 interpreted as the joint probabilities of measuring two non commutative observable associated with the same particle at the same time .",
    "this is forbidden by quantum mechanics and we must conclude that @xmath32 is non adapted to the description of the experiments . in reality",
    "this reasoning is not explicitly present in @xcite but can be attached to the work of a.  fine @xcite .",
    "however lochak agreed completely with this reasoning which complete his one@xcite .",
    "again comes the question : does this implies necessarily non locality ?",
    "lochak answer a second time by the negative .",
    "it could be that quantum mechanics is effectively non local but it could be that the hidden variable definition of bell is simply wrong .",
    "indeed , may be the hidden variable , which are involved in any calculation of observable and probabilities , should be defined at the time of the measurements and should include the local settings @xmath75 this direct generalization of the single particle case to the many particle problem was the aim of the research made by de broglie and his group .",
    "the fact that de broglie never succeeded to build such local model can not however be considered as a proof against lochak s reasoning .",
    "what i want to show now is that there are several errors in the deductions of lochak .    consider first the single particle measurement described in the context of the de broglie model .",
    "lochak proved that we can always define the averages and the probabilities as a function of the actual particle position @xmath76 at the time @xmath67 of the measurement .",
    "if this time tends to @xmath77 we can justify all the predictions given by quantum mechanics .",
    "however if we consider the model of de broglie this is not the unique description of the phenomenon @xcite .",
    "indeed we can always define univocally the actual position @xmath78 measured for example at @xmath55 by a function of the initial coordinate @xmath79 of the particle at a time @xmath80 , i.  e.  a long time before that the particle enters in the stern and gerlach apparatus . due to the conservation of probability requirement",
    "the number of states defined by @xmath81 in the elementary volume @xmath82 is naturally identical to @xmath83 i.  e.  : @xmath84 this result is of course well known in fluid dynamics where it is associated to the names of euler and lagrange ( the so called euler - lagrange coordinates ) .",
    "similarly @xmath85 can be expressed as a function of the initial coordinates of the particle and can be written @xmath86 .",
    "this is effectively clear if we write @xmath87 and substitute it in the expression for @xmath53 .",
    "if we consider now the expectation value @xmath88 , we can write @xmath89 if we choose @xmath55 then @xmath90 and we have the complete definition of bell ( with now @xmath35 independent of @xmath10 as desired ) .",
    "the apparent paradox obtained by lochak originates from the fact that we can define the observables in function either a ) of the initial state or b ) of the actual state obtained after the measurement .",
    "this two choices a and b are mathematically possible and equivalent as it is in classical fluid mechanics .",
    "however , only in the choice a ( of bell ) a clear formulation of locality is possible .",
    "indeed , the bell definition of @xmath91 is possible only in a local word but the definitions @xmath92 and @xmath93 of lochak for a system of one or two particles can be used also in a non local world .",
    "the definitions b of lochak can therefore not help us to take any conclusions concerning nonlocality .",
    "there is obviously a contradiction between our conclusion and the general result of lochak - fine concerning the joint probability @xmath94 .    in order to solve this paradox",
    "it is sufficient to realize that , contrarily to what it is claimed in @xcite , @xmath94 has not to be considered as an observable . if we consider the definition eq .  5 and interpret this number as a joint probability associated with an experimental protocol , we deduce of course that such protocol is realizable if the two measurements are independent and permutable in opposition with the basics rule of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , the number @xmath95 can always be defined mathematically without any paradox or contradiction and without being necessarily associated with a possible experiment . in fact , the `` probability '' @xmath95 is just a measure of the number of common elementary states which go along the direction @xmath15 when using device @xmath10 , and along the direction @xmath31 when using device @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we can consider the figure 2 as a help : a initial state which is characterized by different possible @xmath0 can be represented by an ensemble of point @xmath96 characterized by a density @xmath35 .",
    "such ensemble is directly interpreted in the de broglie model in which the hidden parameters are the positions of the particles . for a given orientation @xmath10 of the magnetic field",
    "the points of this ensemble will deterministically move in one or the other of the separated regions `` + '' and `` -''associated with the two values of the observable ( see figure 2a ) . by changing the orientation of the field we modify the partition of the whole ensemble going through the beam splitter in the region ``",
    "+ '' or `` - '' ( see figure 2b ) . however the total number of states is conserved and we can formally define the number of points @xmath97 contained in the intersections `` @xmath98 '' and `` @xmath99''associated with these two partitions of @xmath96 ( see figure 2c ) .",
    "the main thing is that these new partitions have not to be considered as physical since they can not be associated with an experimental procedure .",
    "this is the essential mistake of lochak .",
    "more precisely since obviously @xmath94 is smaller than both @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xcite the number of points contained in @xmath28 will just contribute partially to the outcomes [ @xmath102 and [ @xmath103 . observing only the total number of particles contained in these two outcomes ( associated with two complementary and incompatible experiments ) we can consequently not say if such or such individual particle was or not contained in @xmath28 . in other words",
    "this means that the probability @xmath94 defined by lochak is not an observable but an hidden probability contrarily to what it was claimed in @xcite .     into two parts @xmath104 and @xmath105 due to a measurement of the spin along a)the axis @xmath10 or b ) the axis @xmath36 .",
    "the intersection of such two partitions represented on c ) is not associated with an individual experience and is just a mathematical definition . , width=10 ]    it is important to observe that lochak was very close of the correct analysis when he said:``__one could object : it is true that we can not measure in one experiment two different projection of the spin of [ the particle ] in the direction @xmath10 and @xmath106 , but we can conceive , for the same state @xmath0 of this particle , two different experiments for the measurement of each of these projections and define the probability @xmath107 of finding @xmath15 , if we measure the projection @xmath10 , and @xmath108 , if we measure the projection @xmath106 _ _ '' .",
    "however in spite of his similarity this second interpretation of the probability proposed in @xcite is in fact different of ours and was rejected by lochak immediately after its introduction . indeed for lochak `` _ two different experiments _ '' mean a temporal succession of two measurements .",
    "but it is well know since the work of de broglie @xcite that the results of such succession of experiments depends on the order of the measurement",
    ". we should not then in this context be able to write an unique expression for the probability @xmath109 defined in the precedent citation of lochak . in the words of lochak `` _ _ the probability of finding the value @xmath15 and @xmath108 by measuring two spin components @xmath10 and @xmath106 depends on the order of the measurements .",
    "but this fact and so the nonexistence of the probability @xmath109 is not a blemish of the theory , it is a consequence of the wave particle dualism : if a hidden - parameter theory contradicts this fact , it will necessary contradict several correct results of usual wave mechanics _ _ '' .",
    "however again there is a misinterpretation and the probability defined by @xmath97 has not to be associated with a succession of two measurements .",
    "we can define naturally and without contradiction the probability of two successive measurements of the spin components using the initial value of the hidden parameter introduced by bell and we have @xmath110 where @xmath25 is the probability of finding @xmath111 for the first measurement if we know that the initial value of the hidden parameter is @xmath0 , and @xmath112 is the probability of finding @xmath108 for the second measurement if we know that the initial value of the hidden parameter is @xmath0 and if we know that the result of the first measurement was @xmath15 .",
    "clearly we have no reason to have @xmath113 because the order of the two measurements is crucial in the evolution of the dynamical variable .",
    "there is then no reason to identify @xmath114 and @xmath109",
    ".    it can be added that our reasoning was centered on local deterministic theories for which we have @xmath115 .",
    "however our present refutation can be done in the most general context of local objective theories @xcite for which the particle can obey to a statistical hidden dynamic taking into account the detectors .",
    "the probabilities @xmath116 are now general distributions obeying only to the condition @xmath117 .",
    "we have equality if there is non absorbtion .",
    "we see that the simple interpretation in terms of sub - ensemble given by lochak in eqs .",
    "[ e1],[e4 ] is not possible .",
    "however since the second line of eq .",
    "[ e5 ] is still valid our critics are the same : products of probabilities such as @xmath118 have not to be interpreted necessary as a probability associated with a unique experimental process i.  e.   that we have not @xmath119 ( which by the way does not exist ) .",
    "a mathematical deduction similar to the one by lochak was done by a.  fine @xcite and lochak refers to his work in his latter publications ( see the debate between despagnat and lochak on this subject@xcite ) but the conclusion is completely different .",
    "fine concluded that if we use the definition given by bell of @xmath35 then we must accept that we can define probabilities for non commutating observable .",
    "this is identical to the result of lochak but for fine this means that locality must be wrong .",
    "however this result is not more satisfying since it is based on the same misconceptions of the `` joint '' probabilities involved .",
    "our critics apply then as well to his reasoning .",
    "finally i want to make the following remark : i)if we accept that there is a fundamental dynamic describing the reality ( deterministic or stochastic ) in term of a temporal evolution of certain dynamical parameter , ii ) if we accept the principle of locality saying that the initial state in independent of the subsequent measurement , and iii ) if we accept the basic rules of the probability calculus ( in particular the law of probability conservation ) , then we can always write expressions such as [ e1 ] or [ e6 ] . the claim of lochak concerning the possibility to save locality by forbidding the use of the initial density of probability when calculating observable must then be wrong par principe .",
    "fine did nt make this error but he identified uncorrectly , as lochak did before him , the probability defined by the formula 5,12,13 with a joint probability associated with an experiment .",
    "what is the conclusion of our reasoning ?",
    "first we observed that the model of de broglie considered by lochak allows the definition of the expectation values as functions of the initial state @xmath120 existing prior to the measurement .",
    "we can in this description  la bell introduce the density of probability @xmath91 in the calculation of the observable .",
    "this is in contradiction with the claim of lochak concerning the impossibility to use such distribution in the calculation of the observable .",
    "this simple fact implies already that the reasoning of lochak is wrong .",
    "secondly we found the origin of the paradox observing that the probabilities defined in eqs .",
    "4,5 and eqs .",
    "12,13 have not to be considered as associated with a measurement procedures .",
    "indeed quantum mechanics forbids definition of such probabilities in the case of non commutating observable measurement .",
    "the probabilities eqs .",
    "4,5,12,13 are in general only mathematical definitions which have not to be connected with a physical measurement . in other terms",
    "these probabilities are hidden .",
    "the problem in the deductions done by lochak is even more fundamental and takes his source in a profound misinterpretation of the definition of a probability space . indeed if we accept the concepts of dynamics , locality and of conservation of probability we must always be able to express any expectation values as a sum or integral over the initial distribution @xmath91 of some initial dynamical parameter @xmath120 describing the quantum system .",
    "the locality imposes that the initial state is independent of the observation settings @xmath68 ... and there is consequently no way of finding a hypothetical loophole in the conclusion given by bell@xcite .",
    "latter after that this manuscript was completed i become aware of a counter argument of a.  shimony@xcite presenting essentially the same idea concerning the meaning of the probability @xmath107 . detailing his argumentation shimony",
    "explains indeed that well interpreted @xmath121 is `` _ _ the probability that the particle is in a state such that a measurement of spin in the direction @xmath10 ( if that option were taken by the experimenter ) would yield the value @xmath15 , and a measurement of spin in the direction @xmath106 ( if that option were taken by the experimenter ) would yield the value @xmath108 _ _ '' .",
    "this definition is strictly equivalent to ours if we mean by state a hidden state and if this probability @xmath121 is hidden too .",
    "however shimony claimed just after that the interpretation that he proposes was anticipated but rejected immediately by lochak himself .",
    "the passage of @xcite cited by shimony to prove that is `` _ _ one could object : it is true that we can not measure in one experiment two different projection of the spin of [ the particle ] in the direction @xmath10 and @xmath106 , but we can conceive , for the same state @xmath0 of this particle , two different experiments for the measurement of each of these projections and define the probability @xmath121 of finding @xmath15 , if we measure the projection @xmath10 , and @xmath108 , if we measure the projection @xmath106 .",
    "this objection is however invalid , because the impossibility of a simultaneous measurement of two spin projections of the same particle is not due to a simple incompatibility of instruments : it comes from the fact that the state in which we must put the particle to measure its spin components @xmath10 is not the same as the one in which must put it to measure the component @xmath106 _ _ '' .",
    "shimony seems not to have realize that for lochak the probability @xmath107 is a real observable and not a hidden probability .",
    "this come from the fact that the word state used in the shimony definition can not refer to a wave function , associated with a experimental procedure , but only to a pure mathematical subdivision of the whole ensemble @xmath96 without direct experimental meaning .",
    "for lochak , in opposition , this state should be experimentally accessible and all his critics is erroneously constructed on this basis as we explained already before . here again",
    "a not sufficiently precise definition of the vocabulary used implies some confusions .",
    "it then not surprising that in the rest of his comment shimony could not understand lochak .",
    "the last part of the article of shimony concerns the example of the stern and gerlach measurement described by lochak in the context of the double solution theory of de broglie .",
    "shimony made here the hypothesis that the difficulty encountered comes from the fact that the theory of de broglie takes into account the disturbance by the measuring device .",
    "he guessed then that the paradox should be solved if instead of considering the original deterministic hidden variable defined by bell we used the most general stochastic theories analyzed in @xcite .",
    "this is unfortunately wrong because the de broglie model is strictly deterministic .",
