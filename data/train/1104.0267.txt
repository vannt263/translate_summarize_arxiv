    "one of the goals of simulations of lattice qcd is to provide a precise non - perturbative determination of the eos of qcd over the temperature range @xmath1 mev that is being probed in experiments at rhic and the lhc .",
    "the eos , along with the transition temperature @xmath2 and transport coefficients such as shear viscosity , are crucial inputs into phenomenological hydrodynamical models used to describe the evolution of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in this talk",
    "i will mainly review the two recent and most complete calculations of the eos by the hotqcd  @xcite and wuppertal - budapest  @xcite collaborations .",
    "simulations of lattice qcd at finite temperature are carried out on a 4-d hypercube of size @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the lattice spacing usually denoted in units of gev@xmath5 or fermi .",
    "the spatial size @xmath6 is taken large enough so that finite volume corrections are under control and small .",
    "past calculations show that for finite temperature simulations with @xmath7 these corrections are smaller than statistical errors for @xmath8 . for higher temperatures larger",
    "@xmath9 may be required . in qcd",
    ", the gauge coupling @xmath10 is related to @xmath4 by dimensional transmutation and the continuum theory is recovered in the limit @xmath11 or equivalently @xmath12 or @xmath13 . to provide a perspective on how fine the current lattice simulations are note that @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath15 fermi or @xmath16 gev@xmath5 at the transition temperature @xmath17 mev .",
    "the second set of control parameters ( inputs ) in the simulations are the quark masses .",
    "the results discussed in this review are for @xmath18 flavors , @xmath19 , two flavors of degenerate @xmath20 and @xmath21 quarks and a heavier strange quark . in nature",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 mev and @xmath24 mev .",
    "the small value of @xmath25 provides the key computational challenge because the most time consuming part of the simulations is the inversion of the dirac operator , a very large sparse matrix .",
    "this inversion is done using interative krilov solvers that have critical slowing down in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "the computational cost increases as @xmath27 or faster and calculations become very expensive with decreasing quark mass . for this reason @xmath18 flavor simulations",
    "are typically done fixing the strange quark mass to its physical value and simulating at a number of values of @xmath28 from which extrapolations to the physical @xmath25 are made .",
    "recent calculations by the w - b and hotqcd collaborations show that the computer power has reached a stage where simulations can be done close to , or directly at , physical @xmath25 .",
    "thus , in the state - of - the - art simulations , this source of systematic error ( extrapolation in @xmath25 ) is now under good control .",
    "the tuning of the set of parameters @xmath29 is done as follows .",
    "one first fixes the ratio @xmath30 , ideally to @xmath31 .",
    "then for a judiciously chosen value of @xmath32 , zero temperature simulations are done to measure two independent physical quantities whose values are experimentally measured or well determined , and one of which is sensitive to strange quark mass , for example the k - meson mass @xmath33 and the pion decay constant @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) . the value of @xmath37 is tuned until the lattice results for these two quantities match their physical values .",
    "this fixes @xmath4 and @xmath37 .",
    "now depending on how finely one wants to scan in @xmath38 ( or @xmath4 ) a new value of @xmath32 is chosen and the value of @xmath37 is again tuned to reproduce the observables , thus determining the new @xmath4 keeping @xmath39 fixed .",
    "this process generates a set of @xmath29 values for which , by construction , the physics ( defined by matching lattice @xmath33 and @xmath34 to physical values ) is fixed .",
    "this line in the @xmath40 space , since @xmath37 is tuned to the physical value and @xmath30 is fixed , is called a line of constant physics ( locp ) .",
    "the utility of simulating along locp is to reduce the three dimensional space of input parameters to a line along which only the lattice spacing is changing .",
    "this procedure provides better control over taking the continuum limit . the extent to which @xmath41",
    "would have varied had one chosen two different physical quantities , say @xmath42 and @xmath43 , is a measure of variations in discretization errors along different locp .",
    "the emphasis of the lattice community is to present results extrapolated to @xmath11 in order to remove these discretization errors , which are proportional to powers of @xmath4 , by simulating at a number of values of @xmath4 . in case of finite temperature calculations",
    "we extrapolate results at fixed @xmath38 to @xmath44 by simulating at a number of values of @xmath45 .",
    "the lattice size in the euclidean time direction defines the temperature of the system by the relation @xmath46 .",
    "the scale @xmath4 for fixed @xmath29 is the same for zero - temperature and finite temperature lattices .",
    "thus , knowing @xmath4 corresponding to a given @xmath32 and quark masses uniquely determines @xmath38 for a given @xmath45 .",
    "an important consequence of the fact that @xmath32 or equivalently @xmath4 or @xmath38 is the single parameter that controls lattice simulations is that only one thermodynamic quantity can be determined , which for the extraction of eos is the trace anomaly @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is called the integration measure .",
    "the above approach for scanning in @xmath38 is called the fixed @xmath45 approach . a second approach that i will not cover in detail and",
    "which is being pursued by the whot collaboration  @xcite with improved wilson fermions is called the fixed @xmath4 approach . in this approach , for a given @xmath4 ( the same process is used for fixing @xmath40 ) one simulates on a number of different @xmath45 lattices to scan in @xmath38 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that only a single zero - temperature matching calculation , needed to carry out subtractions of lattice artifacts in finite @xmath38 data , is required for each @xmath4 .",
    "the weakness of this approach is that the scan in @xmath38 is limited by the coarseness and range of @xmath45 values possible , @xmath19 @xmath49 , before one runs out of computational power .",
    "the recent results using the fixed @xmath4 approach by the whot collaboration  @xcite are very encouraging and i refer interested readers to their paper for details .",
    "in the naive discretization of the dirac action there automatically is a @xmath50 doubling of flavors . in the staggered fermion approach , using a lattice symmetry called `` spin diagonalization '' , the degeneracy is reduced from 16 to 4 by placing a single degree of freedom at each lattice site . under this construction",
    "a @xmath50 hypercube is the basic unit cell that reduces to a point in the continuum limit .",
    "the 16 degrees of freedom in the cell represent , in the continuum limit , four identical copies ( called taste ) of dirac fermions . on the lattice",
    "this four - fold degeneracy gives rise to a proliferation of particles propagating in the qcd vacuum , for example , there are 16 pions distinguished by their taste rather than just one .",
    "if taste symmetry was unbroken at finite @xmath4 , the 4-fold degeneracy could be handled by just dividing results by the appropriate degeneracy factor .",
    "problems arise because this degeneracy is broken at finite @xmath4 and one does not know @xmath51 how large this systematic error is and how it effects simulations of qcd thermodynamics in particular . the most common approach to quantify this effect",
    "is to study the difference in the masses of the 16 pions , and determine how these differences vanish when lattice results are extrapolated to the continuum limit .",
    "the hotqcd collaboration has studied the consequences of taste symmetry breaking utilizing three versions of improved staggered fermions @xmath52 the asqtad , p4 and hisq / tree formulations  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ bp_pion_splits_hisq ] we show preliminary hotqcd hisq / tree results for @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the goldstone pion mass versus @xmath4 , and also compare with results from the stout and asqtad actions .",
    "the large spread in masses that increases on coarser lattices shows that taste symmetry is indeed badly broken  @xcite .",
    "based on such studies",
    "the conclusion is that at any given @xmath4 , the taste breaking is least in hisq / tree followed by stout , asqtad , and p4 actions .",
    "one consequence of this discretization error for thermodynamics is that the contribution of any state , for example the pion , is not just from the lowest taste state ( the goldstone pion ) but is some weighted average of the 16 pions ( or the appropriate multiplets for other states ) .",
    "thus , at any given @xmath4 the effective masses of all hadrons are larger than the desired ground state value .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ bp_pion_splits_hisq ] which plots the root mean squared mass of the 16 pion states corresponding to a goldstone pion mass of @xmath55 mev .",
    "results at low temperatures , @xmath56 mev , and on small @xmath45 lattices are most susceptible to this discretization error .",
    "taste breaking also puts a caveat on the above described tuning of quark masses : setting @xmath57 does not guarantee that simulations have been done at the physical light quark masses . simulating at a number of @xmath30 values to control the chiral extrapolation followed by",
    "taking the continuum limit using a number of @xmath45 lattices provides the best understanding of systematic errors and for obtaining physical results .",

    "note that the hisq action used so far for thermodynamics does not include tadpole improvement of the gauge action and is therefore called hisq / tree in  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a second issue with staggered simulations that include the strange quark ( or in future the charm quark ) is the need to take the fourth root of the determinant to compensate for the 4-fold degeneracy .",
    "creutz  @xcite claims that this `` rooting '' is a fundamental flaw of the staggered formulation , however , its effect in current simulations may be small since the strange quark mass is large , whereas the review by sharpe  @xcite ( covering a large body of work ) shows that while the staggered formulation may be ugly , it gives physical results in the continuum limit .",
    "( for degenerate @xmath20 and @xmath21 quarks , this rooting problem is overcome because of a lattice symmetry whereby the square root of the determinant can be written as the determinant on even ( or odd ) sites . ) in a perfect world one would like to use a wilson - like action that maintains the continuum flavor structure and chiral symmetry , @xmath19 , domain wall or overlap fermions , however , to date most thermodynamical simulations use staggered fermions for two reason : they are much faster ( @xmath58 ) to simulate than even simple wilson fermions and because of a residual chiral symmetry that protects the goldstone pion .",
    "the results from the hotqcd  @xcite  @xcite and w - b  @xcite collaborations for @xmath59 , the single thermodynamic quantity calculated on the lattice , are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : wbeos_i ] ) and the three points ( green points in fig .  [ fig : wbeos_i ] ) with @xmath63 provide a consistency check since they show no significant discretization effects relative to @xmath68 data .",
    "the overall form of the results by the two collaborations is similar .",
    "there are , however , two significant differences between the hotqcd and w - b data .",
    "the first is the value of @xmath48 at the peak , @xmath70 versus @xmath71 , and the peak in the w - b data is shifted to lower @xmath38 by about @xmath72 mev .",
    "w - b collaboration attribute these differences to the lack of extrapolation of hotqcd data in quark mass and @xmath4 , @xmath19 , residual discretization errors .",
    "preliminary hotqcd results with @xmath68 lattices using hisq / tree fermions ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wbeos_i ] ) give a similar peak height and position as the asqtad action ( the p4 results are higher but decreasing with @xmath45 ) .",
    "the agreement between asqtad and hisq / tree and since the hisq / tree action is the more improved than stout , has smaller discretization errors and less taste breaking , it is not clear if , today , we have a simple resolution of the difference .",

    "the hotqcd collaboration has investigated a number of ansatz for parameterizing @xmath79 and find that the results for @xmath74 do not vary significantly .",

    "the systematic errors in lattice data grow as @xmath38 is lowered and are expected to be large below @xmath83 mev . at the same time @xmath84 is not negligible and @xmath51 unknown .",
    "one approach is to use the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model for @xmath85 .",
    "this requires that there be reasonable agreement between the hrg and lattice values at @xmath83 mev .",
    "the hotqcd data approaches the hgr from below and at @xmath83 mev there is a significant difference .",
