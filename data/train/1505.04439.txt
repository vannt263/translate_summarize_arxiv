    "recently there has been an intense investigation of the 6d @xmath14 superconformal field theories ( scfts ) by using the f - theory compactification on elliptically fibered calabi - yau spaces and the various brane pictures , which includes their strings@xcite , classifications @xcite , compactifications @xcite , and anomaly polynomials as well as rg flows @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "typical examples are those on the m5 branes near the @xmath15 symmetric m9 wall or on the transverse @xmath16 type singularities or both .",
    "interestingly , the 6d scft on a single m5-brane probing the @xmath15 symmetric m9-brane @xcite can be also realized as the theory on a single m5-brane probing a @xmath17 singularity , namely the 6d @xmath18 minimal conformal matter @xcite .",
    "it is also known that this 6d theory arises as the theory at the uv fixed point of the 5d @xmath19 gauge theory with 8 flavors @xcite .",
    "its coupling constant is proportional to the size of the compact circle and the strong coupling limit of the 5d theory would be the 6d theory . by decoupling flavors",
    "one by one from the 5d theory , one can realize 5d @xmath19 gauge theories with @xmath20 flavors which have the 5d strongly coupled fixed point with enhanced @xmath21 global symmetry @xcite .",
    "there are old brane diagram arguments @xcite , recent index calculations @xcite , and more recent related arguments to support this symmetry enhancement @xcite .",
    "the 5d @xmath19 gauge theories have yet another realization as a @xmath22 5-brane web diagram .",
    "the @xmath19 gauge theories with @xmath23 flavors have a usual web diagram realization @xcite including diagrams suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , when the number of the flavors reaches eight , we need to consider a new class of the web diagram , so - called tao web diagram introduced in @xcite , which is given by 5-branes that infinitely expand in a spiral configuration .",
    "the appearance of the spiral is interpreted as the @xmath24 for the 6th dimension .",
    "an important characteristic of the tao diagram is that its period of the spiral rotation is identified with the instanton factor of the theory .",
    "from the point of view of the tao diagram @xcite , the rank of the gauge group is not limited and various tao diagrams are possible including quiver gauge theories , which may reflect close connection of tao diagrams to various 6d scfts . however , the relation between the classification of 6d scfts and the 5d theories realized by the tao diagrams was not clear .",
    "in this paper , we argue that the @xmath25 type tao diagram can have a definite relation to 6d scfts .",
    "we identify its 6d origin and claim that it is the generalization of the correspondence between the 5d @xmath19 gauge theory with @xmath26 flavors and the @xmath27 minimal conformal matter on @xmath24 .",
    "our main conjecture is that 5d @xmath5 gauge theory with @xmath28 flavors with the vanishing chern - simons ( cs ) level has the 6d uv fixed point which is the @xmath0 minimal conformal matter .",
    "we also argue that the global symmetry at the fixed point is enhanced to @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , starting from the 5d @xmath5 gauge theory with @xmath28 and decoupling flavors one by one , it is again possible to construct all the 5d @xmath5 gauge theories with the various cs level which have the 5d uv fixed point .",
    "the tao diagram then reduces to a standard web diagram of @xmath22 5-branes .",
    "bergman and zafrir have already conjectured the existence of the uv fixed points for @xmath5 theories with @xmath29 in @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we summarize our idea and results . in section [ sec:6dto5d ] , we consider two paths to support our conjecture . one way is to use the brane set up @xcite for the 6d @xmath2 gauge theory with @xmath30 fundamental hypermultiplets and a single tensor multiplet coupled to cancel the gauge anomaly @xcite by the green - schwarz mechanism and @xmath31 fundamental matter wit a tensor multiplet has an additional constraint on @xmath31 by the global anomaly cancellation due to @xmath32 @xcite",
    ". the acceptable number of flavors for the @xmath19 gauge case is @xmath33 .",
    "the 6d counter part for our 5d @xmath34 theory with @xmath35 is this 6d @xmath36 theory with @xmath35 . ] , which corresponds to the @xmath0 minimal conformal matter in the tensor branch .",
    "after circle compactification with wilson line breaking @xmath2 to @xmath37 , we explain how we obtain 5d @xmath5 gauge theory with @xmath6 fundamental hypermultiplets by brane dynamics .",
    "another way is to use the description as the worldvolume theory on a single m5-brane probing the orbifold singularity @xmath38 .",
    "compactifying on @xmath24 the m5-brane would yield type iia setup of a single d4-brane on the same singularity , and the resulting 5d theory is well - known to be associated with the affine d - type dynkin quiver  @xcite . here",
    "we propose a 5-brane web realization of this quiver theory and the s - dual of this is precisely the @xmath5 gauge theory with @xmath6 flavors .",
    "we also show that the expected relation between the gauge couplings and the compactified radius is reproduced via tao diagram .    in section [ sec :",
    "globalsymm ] , we systematically study the global symmetry enhancement of the 5d @xmath25 theory with @xmath39 flavors . for convenience . ]",
    "we start from the brane web diagram for the 5d @xmath25 theory with @xmath40 flavors and remove the flavor multiplets one by one by making its mass infinite .",
    "each removal generates the half integer chern - simons level whose sign depends on the sign of the mass term , leading to a class of 5d @xmath41 theories with @xmath31 flavors represents that @xmath25 gauge theory of chern - simons level @xmath42 .",

    "these 5d @xmath44 theories with @xmath31 flavors with constraint @xmath43 have classically @xmath45 global symmetry where @xmath46 is the baryonic part of the flavor symmetry and @xmath47 is the topological symmetry arising from the instanton numbers .",
    "these theories have an enhanced symmetry at the uv fixed point which is a subgroup of @xmath48 .",
    "we calculate enhanced symmetry for all of the @xmath41 theories with flavors @xmath49 and of the @xmath50 theories with flavors @xmath51 .",
    "especially , we find that the @xmath52 theory with @xmath53 flavors has @xmath48 global symmetry which is identical to that of the 6d theory .",
    "this is a generalization of the 5d @xmath19 theory with @xmath54 flavors having an enhanced @xmath15 global symmetry .",

    "we enclose all cases for the completeness .",
    "as summarized above , we provide several evidences for our conjecture in this paper",
    ". it would be certainly desirable to find more supports to establish the conjecture .",
    "one way is to calculate the index function with very careful treatment of instanton computation from the 5d point of view and show that the global symmetry is enhanced to @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "a similar calculation has been done for the @xmath19 case with @xmath15 global symmetry @xcite . as done in @xcite",
    ", it is possible to compute the partition function applying the topological vertex method to the tao diagram @xcite .",
    "another way is to start from the 6d point of view . with the introduction of the @xmath2 wilson line , together with the contribution from the tensor multiplet",
    ", the elliptic genus calculation of instanton strings may lead to the 5d @xmath5 gauge symmetry in the coulomb phase @xcite .",
    "our observation for the relation between the 6d and 5d supersymmetric theories may lead to further examples and insights .",
    "[ [ note - added ] ] note added : + + + + + + + + + + +    we here note that our results have some overlap with @xcite , which appeared in arxiv on the same day .",
    "in this section , we justify our main conjecture from two different routes .",
    "our main conjecture is that the 5d @xmath5 gauge theory with @xmath28 flavors and the vanishing cs level has the 6d uv fixed point that is the @xmath0 minimal conformal matter . in other words , a circle compactification of the @xmath0 minimal conformal matter with wilson line along it gives the the 5d @xmath5 gauge theory with @xmath28 flavors and the zero cs level .",
    "hence , our approach is to start from the d - type minimal conformal matter on @xmath24 and then arrive at the 5d @xmath5 gauge theory with @xmath28 flavors and the zero cs level .    in section [ sec : evidence1 ] , we first go to the tensor branch of the @xmath0 minimal conformal matter .",

    "the inverse gauge coupling is then given by the average of these two distances.,width=302 ]    we note that quantum resolution of o7@xmath61-plane is given by the pair of @xmath71 $ ] 7-brane and @xmath70 $ ] 7-brane @xcite . when we apply this property to the two o7@xmath61-planes in this brane setup , we assume that a `` 5-brane loop '' @xcite appears , where the original two ns - branes being part of this 5-brane loop and all the 7-branes are inside the 5-brane loop .",

    ", we are changing the picture so that we look at the theory from the purely 5d point of view .",
    "hence , the notion of the compactified direction is transmuted into the gauge coupling of the theory .",
    "we can see that the radius of the compactified circle is now inherited by the the inverse gauge coupling in the @xmath22 5-brane web diagram , which is identified as the average of the asymptotic distances between @xmath74 5-brane and @xmath75 5-brane measured at the center of mass position of @xmath73 color d5-branes by extrapolating them as in figure [ fig : pq ] ( up to a numerical factor depending on the convention ) .",

    "let us comment on the meaning of the  @xmath84 \" gauge groups .",
    "in fact a set of a bi - fundamental hypermultiplet of @xmath86 and an  @xmath84 \" gauge instanton is equivalent to two fundamental hypermultiplets which are coupled to the @xmath19 gauge group .",

    "we will denote the four  @xmath84 \" gauge groups coming from the horizontal lines with lengths @xmath97 and @xmath96 by @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "therefore , we claim that the web diagram in figure [ fig : sp1-sp1 ] exactly yields the affine @xmath100 dynkin quiver theory in figure [ fig : d5dynkin ] .",
    "it is straightforward to write down a web diagram for general @xmath58 .",
    "namely , we put more closed faces along the horizontal directions",
    ".    one can give a completely different view by the s - duality rotating the web diagram by @xmath101 degrees .",

    "for simplicity , let us focus on the case with @xmath65 .",
    "since the @xmath24 compactification gives the 5d affine @xmath100 quiver theory , an appropriate product of the instanton fugacities of the quiver theory is expected to be equal to the fugacity for the kk @xmath102 symmetry .",
    "the exponents of the instanton fugacity of a gauge node are the comarks .",
    "the exponent for instanton fugacity associated to the extended node is 1 , for instance .",

    "we discuss that the relation is indeed satisfied from the web diagram in figure [ fig : sp1-sp1 ] .",
