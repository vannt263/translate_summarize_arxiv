    "we start by discussing sequential tunneling between two accessible charge states . in the short - time limit , we can approximate the generating function by @xmath76 where @xmath77 linear in time describes a single tunneling - out event .",
    "contributions @xmath3 with @xmath64 tunneling - out events can be ignored for the following reason .",
    "after each tunneling - out event ( being counted ) an electron has to tunnel in ( which is not counted ) before another tunneling - out event can happen .",
