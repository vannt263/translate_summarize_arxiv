    "to access the physics of field theories in the strong coupling regime non - perturbative methods are necessary .",
    "these typically involve the reduction of the field theory to a model with a finite number of degrees of freedom and the use of numerical methods to sample the possible configurations .",
    "the now standard method in this regard is lattice field theory .",
    "it has been developed in the last twenty years into a refined tool @xcite .",
    "however , resorting to a lattice is not the only possible method of reducing a field theory to a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "an alternative is what has become known as the fuzzy approach @xcite-@xcite , see @xcite for a review .    in this approach",
    "one takes the underlying space in the form of its algebra of functions and seeks a sequence of non - commutative algebras with finite dimensional representations , whose limiting form reproduces the commutative algebra .",
    "the elements of the algebra can then be represented by matrices and will play the role of scalar fields in an approximation to field theory .",
    "dirac and yang - mills fields on fuzzy spaces have also been considered .",
    "these involve projective modules over the algebra @xcite .",
    "the method has further been extended to superspace and a fuzzy supersphere has been constructed @xcite .    as a non - perturbative approach to field theory",
    "the fuzzy scheme is very different from the lattice one and many new features emerge .",
    "the most surprising is perhaps the phenomenon of uv / ir mixing @xcite where a residue of the microscopic non - commutativity remains in the commutative limit .",
    "this can be eliminated by suitably modifying the original action of the model .",
    "the most intensely studied example in the fuzzy approach is the so called fuzzy sphere , @xmath2 , which is realized as the matrix algebra of dimension @xmath3 , denoted here @xmath4 , with the inner product where @xmath5 is the @xmath6 norm on @xmath4 . ]",
    "@xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the geometry is specified through the set of derivations @xmath10 that correspond to the adjoint action of the generators @xmath11 of su(2 ) ( with spin @xmath12 ) . for scalar fields",
    "only the laplacian ( or sequence of laplacians parametrized by the matrix size ) plays a role and the geometry is specified by a choice of laplacian .",
    "choosing the laplacian to be @xmath13 gives us a round sphere .",
    "one can therefore view the round fuzzy sphere , @xmath2 , in the spirit of connes @xcite as the triple ( @xmath4 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) i.e. given by the algebra @xmath4 together with the differential operator @xmath13 and the inner product @xmath7 .",
    "more generally one could consider a non - round sphere by utilizing an alternative expression for the laplacian .",
    "for @xmath2 the algebra @xmath4 can be viewed as generated by @xmath15 , which satisfy @xmath16 the @xmath17 satisfy the commutation relations @xmath18=\\frac{ir}{\\sqrt{s(s+1)}}\\epsilon_{ijk}x_k\\ ] ] and become commutative in the large @xmath19 , fixed @xmath20 , limit so that we recover the commutative algebra of functions on @xmath21 .",
    "if instead one scales @xmath20 with @xmath19 one can obtain the non - commutative plane @xcite .",
    "the construction above can be carried out for any @xmath22 @xcite and will be reviewed from the above point of view in the next section .",
    "one can imagine carrying the prescription out more generally by specifying the family of matrices and laplacians such that one recovers the approximated space up to isospectral equivalence .",
    "however , examples beyond the most symmetric spaces have not yet been constructed in this way .    the known constructions ( to date ) of matrix approximations to continuum spaces are almost exclusively coadjoint orbits and their products .",
    "the one apparent exception is @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is an especially important example since it is the most natural replacement of @xmath23 in studies of euclidean quantum field theory .",
    "it is also unusual in that @xmath0 does not admit a symplectic structure and hence a fuzzy version of it could not be achieved by quantization of the classical space .",
    "it is , therefore , important to clarify in what sense a matrix approximation to @xmath0 exists .",
    "we will demonstrate that the matrix algebra approximation of @xmath0 under discussion is really a matrix version of @xmath1 in disguise .",
    "the desired @xmath0 emerges from a kaluza - klein type construction in the fuzzy context .",
    "curiously , the space @xmath1 has recently been considered @xcite in the context of higher dimensional quantum hall liquids and perhaps some of the techniques developed here may be of use in this context .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we present an overview of the fuzzy approach in the case of @xmath22 . in section 3",
    "we show that @xmath0 emerges from a matrix construction as the matrix size is sent to infinity . in section 4",
    "we study the representation content of the matrix algebra and give our solution to the problem of suppressing non-@xmath0 modes . as a side product of our construction",
    "we are able to find the projector necessary to eliminate non-@xmath0 modes .",
    "section 5 gives our prescription for the scalar field action where the non-@xmath0 modes are dynamically suppressed .",
    "one can see from the general discussion that it corresponds to a @xmath1 model where the maximal @xmath24 symmetry is reduced to an @xmath25 symmetry .",
    "geometrically the model corresponds to a kaluza - klein type space which is an @xmath21 bundle over @xmath0 with the radii of the @xmath21 fibres being sent to zero as the energy scale of the unwanted modes is sent to infinity .",
    "section 6 gives our conclusions .",
    "we begin by reviewing the construction of @xmath27 . for",
    "this one takes the @xmath19 fold symmetric tensor product of the fundamental representation of @xmath28 , which in terms of young tableaux is the denoted @xmath29 where @xmath30",
    ". the sequence of matrix algebras under consideration will then be @xmath31 which will be endowed with the inner product @xmath32 with @xmath8 and @xmath33 .",
    "the geometry has not as yet been specified since a sequence of differential operators is not yet given . when the geometry is specified by a laplacian , the number of eigenvalues of that laplacian , less than a cutoff momentum scale @xmath34 , increases with the cutoff as @xmath35 .",
    "since the total number of degrees of freedom in the matrix algebra is @xmath36 and our cutoff is @xmath19 , we can deduce the dimension of the space being approximated via @xmath37 which is consistent with @xmath22 .",
    "if we choose our differential operators to be built from the generators , @xmath38 , of @xmath28 in the @xmath39 representation and the generators @xmath40 in the complex conjugate representation , with these latter operators acting on matrices on the right , then matrices are equivalent to the product representation @xmath41 which can be expanded in terms of @xmath28 representations to yield the expansion of matrices in terms of polarization tensors .",
    "for example for @xmath42 with @xmath43 we have @xmath44 and the expansion : @xmath45 in the special case of @xmath46 , for example with @xmath43 , we have @xmath47 and the decomposition @xmath48 and we see that the expansion is in terms of integer angular momentum and is cut off at @xmath49 . in general for the @xmath19-fold symmetric tensor product representation , the angular momentum will be cutoff at @xmath50 and as @xmath51 we recover all of the representations corresponding to functions on @xmath21 .",
    "similarly in the @xmath51 limit of the @xmath28 case we recover @xmath22 .",
    "fuzzy @xmath22 would then , by analogy with @xmath2 , be considered as the triple ( @xmath52 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) where now the sequence of matrices is that of dimension we sill simply denote @xmath53 by @xmath54 .",
    "] @xmath30 , @xmath55 with as before @xmath56 , where @xmath8 and @xmath57 .    a scalar field action on @xmath22",
    "would then correspond to @xmath58=\\frac{tr}{d^n_{l}}[\\frac{1}{2}\\phi{\\cal l}^2\\phi + v(\\phi)]\\ ] ] the @xmath59 model of this type on @xmath2 has been analyzed in @xcite and is currently being studied numerically as a testing ground for the feasibility of the numerical approach .",
    "let us now turn to the construction of @xmath60 . for this observe that @xmath61 , with @xmath62 the dirac matrices including @xmath63 , satisfy @xmath64 this gives us a matrix approximation to the defining equation of @xmath0 in @xmath65 and is the direct analogue of ( [ s2_f_defn ] ) for @xmath2 . to get our sequence of matrices approximating @xmath0",
    "we are led to consider representations of the group @xmath66 ( or equivalently @xmath67 ) . in the above",
    "we have used the defining four dimensional representation @xmath68 of @xmath66 .",
    "we can therefore consider the irreducible representation obtained from the @xmath19 fold symmetric tensor product of this representation i.e. the @xmath66 representation @xmath69 which will contain a set of five matrices : @xmath70 , @xmath71 which can be realized as the symmetrization of @xmath19 copies of the @xmath72 matrices in the @xmath66 fundamental representation : @xmath73 where the subscript @xmath74 indicates that we are projecting onto the irreducible totally symmetrized representation .",
    "these matrices satisfy the relation @xmath75 so that we can define a sequence of matrices explicit .",
    "] , @xmath76 , given by @xmath77 the algebra generated by these functions will become commutative in the infinite @xmath19 limit ( see the discussion associated with eq .",
    "( [ commutator_of_s4 ] ) ) and since in the commutative case it is easy to check that the five co - ordinate functions @xmath78 ( satisfying @xmath79 ) generate @xmath80 we will recover @xmath0 in the limit .",
    "if we return to the matrices arising at level @xmath81 , we see that the @xmath62 are not sufficient to form a basis for all matrices , but rather , to get a basis , we need to include the matrices @xmath82 $ ] . we can now expand any @xmath83 matrix in terms of the 16 matrices @xmath84 . in this approximation ( i.e. @xmath81 ) a matrix representing a function on @xmath0 will be of the form @xmath85 and our cutoff angular momentum on @xmath0 will again be @xmath86 ( as it was at the corresponding @xmath81 approximation to @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , a matrix product of two such functions will involve a non - zero coefficient of @xmath87 and in the absence of arbitrary such coefficients the algebra does not close .",
    "these parameters will have no corresponding counterparts in the expansion of functions on commutative @xmath0 .",
    "one option as argued by ramgoolam @xcite is to project out such terms , in which case one is left with a non - associative algebra .",
    "this involves additional complications and does not seem particularly suited to numerical work .",
    "in addition the necessary projector must be constructed .",
    "we will return to this point in a concluding section where we will , in fact , give the projector .",
    "an alternative is to include arbitrary coefficients of @xmath87 ( demanding an associative algebra ) and attempt to suppress such coefficients of unwanted terms , by making their excitation improbable in the dynamics . in this approach",
    "our algebra will be a full matrix algebra and obviously associative .",
    "the principal task of this paper will therefore be to give a prescription for suppressing the additional modes that arise in this extended algebra .    from a physics point of view",
    "the matrices are to play the role of our scalar fields which will be sampled in a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "we will therefore be seeking an appropriate scalar field action which suppresses the non-@xmath0 modes in a probabilistic sense in our simulations .",
    "a successful method of suppressing the unwanted modes would be to add to the scalar action a term @xmath88 $ ] which is positive for any @xmath89 and zero only for matrices that correspond to functions on @xmath0 , and non - zero for those that do not .",
    "the modified action would therefore be of the form @xmath90+h s_i[\\phi]$ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 should then be chosen large and positive .",
    "the probability of any given matrix configuration then takes the form @xmath92=\\frac{{\\rm e}^{-s[\\phi]-hs_i[\\phi]}}{z } \\label{prob_of_config}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 { \\rm e}^{-s[\\phi]-hs_i[\\phi ] } \\label{partition_fn}\\ ] ] is the partition function of the model .",
    "we will show that this can be achieved by choosing @xmath94=\\frac{tr } { d_l}(\\frac{1}{2}\\phi\\delta_i\\phi)$ ] with @xmath95 and @xmath96 a positive operator .",
    "it can be interpreted as a modification of the laplacian which is zero on matrices corresponding to @xmath0 .    from ( [ dim_cpn ] )",
    "we see that the dimension of the space being approximated by this sequence of matrices is in fact six and not four .",
    "we will further see that the entire model , when the unwanted degrees of freedom are included , corresponds to a fuzzy version of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 is an @xmath21 bundle over @xmath0 and the parameter @xmath91 can be related to the radius of the @xmath21 fibres over @xmath0 with the radius being sent to zero as @xmath97 @xcite . in this sense we will have a fuzzy kaluza - klein type space whose low energy limit is @xmath0 .",
    "the matrices @xmath98 with @xmath99 are the generators of @xmath66 in the fundamental representation . if we further identify @xmath100 , then the set @xmath101 with @xmath102 are the generators of @xmath103 in its fundamental representation @xmath104",

    "we see that this sequence is one associated with an approximation to a six rather than four dimensional space . since @xmath115 the natural geometry associated with the @xmath103 approach is that of a fuzzy approximation to @xmath1 .",

    "note , the @xmath19 fold symmetric tensor product representation @xmath107 of @xmath103 is precisely the representation @xmath117 or equivalently the @xmath118 representation of @xmath42 .    in this sequence of representations",

    "is clear there are now two available candidates , the quadratic casimir operator of @xmath24 or that of @xmath25 , which are respectively : @xmath123 if we chose the @xmath24 casimir ( which is equally the @xmath42 casimir ) we are imposing the geometry of a round @xmath1 .",
    "but of course for a round @xmath0 @xmath25 symmetry is all we need .",
    "if we take the @xmath66 point of view then an arbitrary matrix can be considered as an element of the vector space @xmath124 which reduces under @xmath66 as : @xmath125 with the dimension of @xmath126 being @xcite + @xmath127 only the representations @xmath128 correspond to functions on @xmath0 , all others are non-@xmath0 representations .    equivalently taking the @xmath103 point of view one",
    "has the @xmath103 reduction @xmath129 where @xmath130 furthermore , one can see that the @xmath24 representation @xmath131 breaks up as a sum of @xmath25 representations and we have : @xmath132    one can gain more insight into the role of these representations and the above decompositions by thinking of the above arguments in terms of polarization tensors .    in our context , an arbitrary matrix , which plays the role of a scalar field ,",
    "can be decomposed into a sum of orthonormal polarization tensors where the set of polarization tensors carry the representation content ( [ rep_content ] ) .",
    "thus an arbitrary matrix @xmath133 , can be decomposed as @xmath134 where @xmath135 are the polarization tensors .",
    "these are in fact appropriately symmetrized @xmath136-th order polynomial of @xmath70 and @xmath108 , with traces removed and with the order of @xmath108 being @xmath137 .",
    "those that correspond to functions on @xmath0 are therefore the @xmath138 and are matrix versions of the @xmath0 spherical harmonics and the direct analogues of the @xmath139 of @xcite but in an orthogonal basis .",
    "in fact , the decomposition ( [ mhat ] ) corresponds to the @xmath42 decomposition : @xmath140 where @xmath141 with @xmath142 further decomposed under @xmath66 as @xmath143 for example the @xmath144 breaks up as @xmath145 which corresponds to the decomposition of @xmath105 into @xmath70 and @xmath108 .",
    "similarly the @xmath146 decomposes as @xmath147 and so on .",
    "let us now discuss the eigenvalues of the casimirs on the above representations .",
    "we have @xmath148 we see that the operator @xmath149 has eigenvalues @xmath150 and is precisely the operator we require to separate the wanted @xmath0 modes from the unwanted modes .",
    "we are therefore in a position to fix the geometry for our fuzzy space in a fashion which will suppress the non-@xmath0 modes .",
    "the desired laplacian will be @xmath151 the eigenmatrices of this operator are then the polarization tensors @xmath152 and we have the eigenvalue equations @xmath153 from the spectrum we see that @xmath154 has positive spectrum for @xmath155 for all values of @xmath19 .",
    "in fact for @xmath19 finite the permitted values of @xmath91 are slightly larger and one can choose @xmath156 .    furthermore now that we have identified a laplacian type operator which distinguishes between the @xmath0 and non-@xmath0 modes we can further identify the projector that removes the unwanted modes from an arbitrary matrix .",
    "it is simply @xmath157 where @xmath158 are the eigenvalues of @xmath159 of ( [ d101 ] ) .    as mentioned the choice of @xmath160 as laplacian",
    "fixes the geometry to be that of a round @xmath1 .",
    "choosing the linear combination ( [ delta_h_cas_i ] ) of the two casimirs ( [ so6_cas ] ) and ( [ so5_cas ] ) still corresponds to a fuzzy approximation of @xmath1 , we are doing a continuous deformation of its geometry .",
    "the set of eigenmatrices and the function algebra is unchanged , only the laplacian and its eigenvalues are deformed in a continuous fashion .",
    "it will no longer correspond to a round @xmath1 but rather to a squashed @xmath1 with @xmath25 rather than @xmath24 symmetry .",
    "we will make the geometry more explicit in a subsequent article @xcite .",
    "we now see that choosing the modification of the action to be of the form @xmath161=\\frac{tr}{d_l}(\\phi \\mathrm{c}_i \\phi)\\ ] ] has precisely the desired properties , i.e. of being zero on matrices corresponding to functions on @xmath0 and otherwise positive .",
    "so when the parameter @xmath91 is made arbitrarily large the non-@xmath0 modes are suppressed .",
    "in this section we will summarize the prescription for working with a scalar field on @xmath60 .",
    "we begin with the round scalar field theory on @xmath1 given by the action , @xmath163 & = & \\frac{r^4}{d_l } tr \\left ( \\frac{1}{4 r^2 }   [ j_{ab},\\phi]^\\dag [ j_{ab},\\phi ] + v [ \\phi ] \\right )   \\quad . \\label{s_0.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to this we add , the @xmath24 non - invariant but @xmath25 invariant term @xmath164 & = & \\frac{r^4}{d_l } tr \\frac{1}{2r^2}\\left ( [ j_{ab},\\phi]^\\dag [ j_{ab } \\phi ] - \\frac{1}{2 } [ j_{ab}\\phi]^\\dag[j_{ab}\\phi]\\right )     \\label{s_i.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that we have the overall action @xmath90=s_0[\\phi]+h s_i[\\phi]$ ] .",
    "this prescription is equivalent to taking the laplacian which specifies the geometry to be @xmath165 + h ( [ j_{ab}[j_{ab } , \\cdot]]-\\frac{1}{2 } [ j_{ab},[j_{ab } , \\cdot]])\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2r^2}\\left([j_a,[j_a,\\cdot]]+\\frac{(1+h)}{2 } ( [ j_{ab}[j_{ab } , \\cdot]]- [ j_{a},[j_{a } , \\cdot]])\\right ) \\label{delta_h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or equivalently @xmath166 which gives a stable theory for all @xmath19 if @xmath167 .",
    "this form ( [ delta_h_cas ] ) is an interpolation between @xmath25 and @xmath24 casimirs and the laplacian is proportional to the @xmath24 casimir for @xmath168 and the @xmath25 casimir for @xmath169 .",
    "the values of @xmath91 of interest to us are those large and positive since in the quantization of the theory following euclidean functional integral methods , the states unrelated to @xmath0 then become highly improbable ; this is a direct consequence of ( [ d104 ] ) and the expression ( [ prob_of_config ] ) for the probability @xmath170 $ ] .",
    "note : we have not specified the potential of the model since the above prescription is independent of the potential .",
    "the most obvious model to consider would be a quartic potential , since this is relevant to the higgs sector of the standard model .",
    "we have presented a solution to the elimination of non-@xmath0 modes in the fuzzy approach to @xmath0 . the solution was to modify the laplacian of the scalar action .",
    "the modification was to choose the overall laplacian to be a perturbation of the round one on @xmath1 retaining only the @xmath25 symmetry of @xmath0 and proportional to @xmath171 .",
    "the resulting laplacian operator , which specifies the geometry in the fuzzy models , takes the form ( [ delta_h ] ) or ( [ delta_h_cas ] ) and has spectrum @xmath172 it is a positive operator for all @xmath19 if @xmath167 .    from our study of the representation content in section 4",
    "it was possible to construct the projector @xmath173 , eq .",
    "( [ proj_s4 ] ) , which eliminates the non-@xmath0 modes .",
    "this is precisely the projector necessary for the non - associative algebra discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have not pursued this algebra due to its complications .    as we will see in a subsequent article @xcite , using coherent state techniques it is possible to extract the metric ( and hence the geometry ) of the above spaces from the laplacian .",
    "we will in fact show that the space in all cases is @xmath1 and that this space can be viewed as either the orbit @xmath174 or the orbit @xmath175 .",
    "it therefore in general permits an @xmath25 invariant metric when viewed as a @xmath66 orbit , but this can be expanded to a maximal @xmath24 invariance , which we refer to as the round @xmath1 .",
    "when we have only @xmath25 symmetry we have what we call a squashed @xmath1 .",
    "in fact it is possible to show that @xmath1 is locally the direct product @xmath176 and globally an @xmath21 bundle over @xmath0 and that the parameter @xmath91 is a measure of the size of the @xmath21 fibres .",
    "in fact @xmath177 so the value @xmath97 corresponds to shrinking the @xmath21 fibres to zero size , while @xmath178 corresponds to making the fibres infinitely large .",
