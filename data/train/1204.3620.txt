    "one of the out standing problem in particle physics and cosmology is the cosmological constant problem : its theoretical expectation values from quantum field theory exceed observational limits by 120 orders of magnitude ( padmanabhan 2003 ) . even if such high energy are suppressed by super - symmetry , the electroweak corrections are still 56 orders highers .",
    "this problem was further sharpened by recent observation of supernova ia ( sn ia ) , which reveal the striking discovery that our universe has lately been in its accelerated expansion phase ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) cross checks from the cosmic background microwave radiation ( cmbr ) and large scale structure ( lss ) , all confirm this unexpected result ( riess et al .",
    "2004 ; astier et al .",
    "numerous dynamical dark energy models have been proposed in the literature , such as quintessence ( ratra and peebles 1988 ) , phantom ( caldwell 2002 ) , k - essence ( armendariz et al . 2000 ) , tachyon ( padmanabhan 2002 ) , dgp ( dvali et al . 2000 ) and chaplygin gas ( kamenshchik et al 2001 ) . however , the simplest and most theoretically appealing candidate for dark energy is the vacuum energy ( or the cosmological constant @xmath4 ) with a constant equation of state parameter equal to @xmath5 .",
    "+ experimental study of isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and speculation about the amount of helium formed at the early stages of the evolution of universe have stimulated theoretical interest in anisotropic cosmological models . at the present state of evolution ,",
    "the universe is spherically symmetric and the matter distributed in it is on the whole isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "but in its early stages of evolution it could not have such a smoothed out picture because near the big bang singularity neither the assumption of spherical symmetry nor of isotropy can be strictly valid .",
    "anisotropy of the cosmic expansion , which is supposed to be damped out in the course of cosmic evolution , is an important quantity .",
    "recent experimental data and critical arguments support the existence of an anisotropic phase of the cosmic expansion that approaches an isotropic one .",
    "therefore , it make sense to consider models of universe with anisotropic background . here",
    "we confine ourselves of models of bianchi - type v. bianchi - v space - time has a fundamental role in constructing cosmological models suitable for describing the early stages of evolution of universe . in literature collins ( 1974 ) , maarteens and nel ( 1978 ) ,",

    "+ the investigation of relativistic cosmological models usually has the cosmic fluid as perfect fluid . however , these models do not incorporate dissipative mechanism responsible for smoothing out initial anisotropies .",
    "it is believed that during neutrinos decoupling , the matter behaved like a viscous fluid ( klimek 1976 ) in early stages of evolution .",
    "it has been suggested in large class of homogeneous but anisotropic universe , the anisotropy dies away rapidly . the most important mechanism in reducing the anisotropy is neutrinos viscosity at temperature just above @xmath6k .",
    "it is important to develop a model of dissipative cosmological processes in general , so that one can analyze the overall dynamics of dissipation without getting lost in the detail of complex processes .",

    "+ such type of ansatz for scale factor has already been considered by yadav ( 2012 ) which generalized the one proposed by pradhan and amirhashchi ( 2011 ) .",
    "the proposed law ( [ eq5 ] ) yields a time dependent dp which describes the transition of universe from early decelerating phase to current accelerating phase . + the value of dp ( q ) for model ( [ eq1])is found to be @xmath27 from equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , it is clear that the dp @xmath28 is time dependent . also , the transition redshift from deceleration expansion to accelerated expansion is about @xmath29 .",

    "thus the universe has non singular origin and the cosmic expansion is driven by the creation of matter particles .",
    "it has been observed that @xmath128 turns out to be constant .",
    "thus the model approaches homogeneity and matter is dynamically negligible near the origin .",
    "+ the cosmological constant given in sections @xmath129 and @xmath130 are decreasing function of time and they are approach a small positive value as time increases ( i. e. present epoch ) . the value of cosmological constant for these models are supported by the results from recent supernovae observations recently obtained by the high - z supernovae team and supernovae cosmological project ( perlmutter et al .",

    "a positive cosmological constant resists the attractive gravity of matter due to its negative pressure . for most universes ,",
    "the positive cosmological constant eventually dominates over the attraction of matter and drives the universe to expands exponentially .",
