    "suppose we are given a bounded jordan domain @xmath0 and a piecewise continuous function @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting _ dirichlt problem _ is to find a harmonic function on @xmath2 , @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 for all @xmath5 at which @xmath6 is continuous .",
    "it is well - known that this dirichlt problem has a solution .",
    "once the existence of @xmath3 is demonstrated , uniqueness follows immediately from the maximum principle for harmonic functions .",
    "that is , there is exactly one harmonic function on @xmath2 , @xmath3 , for which equation ( [ eqn : diri ] ) holds .",
    "e.g. _ , chapters i and ii of @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we denote this function @xmath7 .",
    "dirichlt problems for other kinds of domains exist but will not be considered here .",
    "when @xmath2 is simply connected , that is when @xmath2 is the interior of a jordan curve , it is fairly straightforward to prove the existence of @xmath7 . in particular , when @xmath2 is the unit disk @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the differential of arc length with respect to the variable @xmath12 .",
    "the function @xmath13 is of course called the _",
    "poisson kernel_. since the composition of a harmonic function with an analytic function yields a harmonic function , the existence of @xmath7 for simply connected jordan domains now follows from the riemann mapping theorem and the carathodory theorem .    when @xmath2 is bounded by more than one jordan curve , there are at least two methods available to prove the existence of @xmath7 .",
    "one is an extreme - value argument as in section 6.4.2 of @xcite .",
    "if one desires a constructive proof , a natural choice is the schwarz alternating method which is described in section iv.2 of @xcite and in chapter ii of @xcite .",
    "a sequence of harmonic functions @xmath14 that converges to @xmath3 is produced thereby .",
    "however , the proof does not give any information about the rate of convergence which is essential for error control when designing a numerical method .",
    "nevertheless , it is hinted in the exercises of @xcite that the schwarz alternating method can be turned into an integral operator which in turn leads to a numerical method with error control .    here , we will turn this chain of ideas on its head and give what appears to be a new and constructive proof of the existence of solutions to dirichlt problems for planar jordan domains based on some fairly elementary ideas from operator theory .",
    "namely , we will first define an integral operator and then show it has a fixed point @xmath3 .",
    "we will then show that this fixed point extends to a harmonic function on @xmath2 for which equation ( [ eqn : diri ] ) holds .",
    "we will also give explicit bounds on the error in the resulting sequence of iterations .",
    "finally , we use these results to derive a closed form for the solution to the dirichlt problem .",
    "all results hold for an arbitrary jordan domain with at least two boundary curves , even those whose boundary is nowhere differentiable .",
    "when @xmath15 is a positive real and @xmath16 , let @xmath17 denote the open disk whose center is @xmath18 and whose radius is @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the space of bounded harmonic functions on @xmath2 with the sup norm .",
    "[ prop : complete ] if @xmath2 is open , then @xmath20 is complete",
    ".    let @xmath21 be a cauchy sequence in @xmath20 .",
    "it follows that this sequence converges uniformly to a function @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that @xmath3 is continuous and bounded .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath3 is harmonic .",
    "to do so , we use the mean value property . accordingly , suppose @xmath23",
    ". then , @xmath24 it follows that @xmath3 is harmonic .",
    "suppose @xmath2 is a bounded jordan domain .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is piecewise continuous .",
    "let @xmath25 , @xmath26 be pairwise disjoint arcs such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are simply connected .",
    "the case when @xmath2 is bounded by four curves is illustrated in figure [ fig : arcs ] .",
    "let @xmath29 , and let @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be a continuous map of @xmath32 onto @xmath33 that is conformal on @xmath8 .",
    "thus , each point of @xmath34 has exactly one preimage under @xmath35 , and each point of @xmath36 has exactly one preimage under @xmath37 .",
    "the existence of these maps follows from theorem 2.1 of @xcite .",
    "let : @xmath38\\\\ b_1 & = & \\phi_1^{-1}[\\sigma]\\\\ b_2 & = & \\phi_2^{-1}[\\tau]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let @xmath39 be the harmonic function on @xmath40 determined by the boundary conditions @xmath41 and let @xmath42 be the harmonic function on @xmath43 determined by the boundary conditions @xmath44 it follows that @xmath39 and @xmath42 have the integral forms : @xmath45 let @xmath46 be the harmonic function on @xmath40 determined by the boundary conditions @xmath47 thus , @xmath46 has the integral form @xmath48 finally , let @xmath49 for each @xmath50 , let @xmath51 be the harmonic function on @xmath40 defined by the boundary conditions @xmath52 thus , @xmath53 has the integral form @xmath54    note that @xmath55 is bounded away from @xmath56 as @xmath12 ranges over @xmath57 .",
    "accordingly , let @xmath58 it follows that @xmath59 .",
    "we now define an operator on @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath61 is harmonic on @xmath40 , let @xmath62 denote the function on @xmath40 defined by the equation @xmath63    the key lemma is the following .",
    "[ lm : contraction ] @xmath64 is a contraction map on @xmath60 . in particular , for all @xmath65 , @xmath66    we first show that @xmath62 is a harmonic function on @xmath40 whenever @xmath61 is .",
    "that is , @xmath64 maps @xmath60 into @xmath60 .",
    "this can be seen by expanding @xmath67 and applying fubini s theorem so as to obtain @xmath68 p(\\phi_1^{-1}(z ) , \\zeta ) ds_\\zeta\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\int_{b_1 } \\left [ \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\int_{b_2 } v(\\phi_2(\\zeta_1 ) ) \\nonumber p(\\phi_2^{-1}\\phi_1(\\zeta ) , \\zeta_1 ) ds_{\\zeta_1}\\right ] p(\\phi_1^{-1}(z ) , \\zeta ) ds_\\zeta\\\\\\label{eqn : expanded}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each summand in equation ( [ eqn : expanded ] ) defines a harmonic function on @xmath40 .",
    "thus , @xmath62 is harmonic on @xmath40 whenever @xmath61 is .",
    "we now show that @xmath64 is a contraction map .",
    "it follows from fubini s theorem that @xmath69",

    "so , let @xmath3 be the fixed point of @xmath64 .",
    "[ lm : success ] @xmath3 extends to a harmonic function on @xmath2 such that @xmath71 for all @xmath5 at which @xmath6 is continuous .    by lemma [ lm :",
    "contraction ] , @xmath3 is harmonic on @xmath40 .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ eqn : expanded ] ) and fubini s theorem that @xmath72 where @xmath73 thus , @xmath74 is the harmonic function on @xmath43 defined by the boundary conditions @xmath75 it also follows that @xmath3 is the harmonic function on @xmath40 defined by the boundary conditions @xmath76 hence , @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .",
    "decompose @xmath2 into the simply connected domains @xmath79 as in figure [ fig : decomp ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath80 for all @xmath81 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath82 for all @xmath83 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath3 extends to a harmonic function on @xmath2 that solves the given dirichlt problem .",
    "a few moments of reflection will reveal that what the operator @xmath64 does is the basic step in the schwarz alternating method .",
    "however , by couching things in the framework of operator theory , it becomes possible to prove convergence using the contraction mapping theorem .",
    "the proof thus gives more information than would be obtained by using harnack s principle since it reveals the rate of convergence of the construction which is important for computation .",
    "we first perform a procedure similar to kernel iteration .",
    "let @xmath84    [ thm : closed.form.1 ] suppose @xmath2 is a planar jordan domain with at least two boundary curves and that @xmath1 is piecewise continuous .",
    "let @xmath85 , @xmath86 , _ etc .",
    "_ be as in section [ sec : operator ] .",
    "then , @xmath87 furthermore , @xmath88    let @xmath89 denote the zero function on @xmath40 .",
