    "we find that the results are analogous to the case of exponential or quadratic potential , i.e. , the big or little rip is avoidable in the inverse-_r _ gravity .",
    "in gr , the phantom field with an exponential or a quadratic potential leads to big or little rip that is characterized by the destruction of all bound structures .",
    "we show the possibility of avoiding the big or little rip naturally in the inverse-_r _ gravity . for a special exponential type potential",

    "and then we investigate these potentials for phantom field @xmath0 in the inverse-_r _ gravity with @xmath40 correction .",

    "it is not a shortcoming that we discuss only the background evolution in this paper but not consider the cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , nojiri and odintsov@xcite have pointed out that modified gravity equations of motion are higher - derivative differential equations .",
