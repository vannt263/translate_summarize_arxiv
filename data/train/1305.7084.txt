    "the resonant optical polarization in semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) is often referred to as _ coherent excitons _ which can be classified using the well - known hydrogen quantum numbers . with the help of additional terahertz ( thz ) excitation",
    ", one can couple the different exciton states , in particular , one can induce transitions between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states @xcite . in this connection ,",
    "strong resonant quasi - cw thz excitation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 transition leads to rabi splitting .",
    "pronounced anticrossing behavior was observed by wagner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite when detuning the thz frequency from the @xmath0-@xmath1 transition .",
    "these effects were explained within the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) which already predicts dressed states .",
    "a number of theoretical investigations have previously been reported on the effect of a strong thz field on e.g. the excitonic absorption @xcite .",
    "the autler - townes splitting and side - band generation for excitonic resonances in qws were discussed theoretically using the rwa  @xcite . however",
    ", a more extensive framework of a fully microscopic theory has already been developed @xcite to fully include non - rwa , ponderomotive , and multi - photon - ionization contributions which are needed to describe extreme nonlinear thz excitation .",
    "in addition , maslov _ et al . _  analyzed the quantum confined stark effect in presence of a thz field oriented in growth direction@xcite .",
    "more detailed studies concerning the combination of an ac and dc field were computed by mi _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the interplay between the dynamic franz - keldysh and the ac stark effect were also discussed by zhang _",
    "et al . _",
    "investigated the interplay between ac stark effect and dynamical localization in a semiconductor superlattice@xcite .",
    "rabi - splitting effects were also observed using strong thz single - cycle pulses@xcite .",
    "in addition to the splitting , also pronounced resonance broadening and induced absorption effects were observed , which could be attributed to the excitation of excitonic states with high quantum numbers and thz - induced exciton ionization .    in this paper , we present a systematic investigation that is intended to fill the gap between the earlier studies and allow us to quantify the limitations of the two - level analysis that includes only the excitonic @xmath0-@xmath1 transition . for this purpose ,",
    "we use the temporally long ( 31ps ) thz pulses of a free - electron laser ( fel ) that are spectrally sufficiently narrow to enable us to study detuning effects from the @xmath0-@xmath1 transition frequency .",
    "furthermore , we use a sample with larger separation between heavy- and light hole energies than used in ref .",
    "we record the thz - induced changes in the near infrared ( nir ) absorption spectrum for weak ( 1.2 kv / cm ) to high thz fields up to 6 kv / cm . since a two - level approximation ( 2la )",
    "is expected to explain only some aspects of the investigation , it is interesting to determine its validity range . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use a microscopic theory  @xcite for the analysis and we compare the results to a 2la where we restrict the treatment to the excitonic @xmath0 and @xmath1 states .",
    "we quantify when and how a 2la deviates from the experimental observations , whereas the fully microscopic theory explains the experiments .",
    "figure [ setup ] illustrates the experimental setup which is a two - beam collinear configuration for thz and nir excitation spectroscopy .",
    "the setup allows the simultaneous excitation of the sample with weak broadband nir and strong narrowband thz light .",
    "apart from the sample used , it is the same setup as in ref .",
    "broadband nir light is generated in a 12-fs ti : sapphire laser oscillator with a repetition rate of 78 mhz .",
    "the repetition rate is reduced by an acousto - optical pulse picker to the 13 mhz of the free - electron laser ( fel ) at the helmholtz - zentrum dresden - rossendorf .",
    "both beams are synchronized with a timing jitter of 1 - 2ps ; the delay can be adjusted using a phase shifter .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the fel pulses is about a factor of 100 smaller than its photon energy , i.e. , for a photon energy of 6.8 mev ( resonant detuning ) we measure 0.06mev fwhm yielding 31ps fel pulses .",
    "the fel pulse duration is determined by fourier transforming the fel spectrum and confirmed by a cross - correlation measurement in a 300@xmath2 m thick gap crystal using intensity - based electro - optic sampling with a single si photodiode @xcite .",
    "the investigated multiple quantum well sample dbr42 contains twenty 8 nm ga@xmath3in@xmath4as qws separated by 92 nm gaas barriers grown on a gaas substrate @xcite . unlike in the sample analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the light hole is energetically more separated from the heavy hole .",

    "both peaks are bleached but the left peak is higher than the right peak .",
    "we use the microscopic theory@xcite ( semiconductor bloch equations including thz interaction ) to treat the light - matter interaction self - consistently . for the thz interaction",
    ", we do not employ the rwa , but fully include the counter - rotating terms .",
    "besides inserting the material parameters appropriate for the sample used in the present study , we additionally evaluate the equations in the limit of the two - level approximation ( 2la ) where we only include the excitonic @xmath0 and @xmath1 states but keep all other parameters the same as in the full analysis .",
    "this allows us to quantify how and when the 2la analysis deviates from experiments .",
    "our detailed theory - experiment comparisons show that the fully theory explains all experimentally observed features . as representative examples ,",

    "[ anticrossing]a and b ) , the 2la gives similar results as the microscopic theory .",
    "however , already for a medium thz field , the microscopic theory predicts asymmetric bleaching and broadening of the rabi peaks in agreement with the experimental results ( fig .",
    "[ anticrossing]d ) , while the 2la yields symmetric splitting and bleaching ( fig .",
    "[ anticrossing]c ) .",
    "hence , the observation of anticrossing is not enough to prove the validity of a 2la .",
    "this shows the importance of higher excitonic states for the shapes of the @xmath0-exciton peak for medium thz fields leading to a complete disagreement of 2la and experiment for high thz fields as already seen in figs .",

    "[ popbehav]b ) , we see only one rabi flop in the microscopic calculation while the 2la incorrectly predicts multiple rabi flopping .    to better monitor the thz influence , we replot the data for @xmath1 and the dark states , but scaled as fraction of all temporarily existing occupations .",

    "the oscillating thz field is shown by the shaded area .",
    "for the low thz field strength ( fig .",
    "[ popbehav]c ) , the microscopic theory and the 2la both describe @xmath0-@xmath1 rabi flopping . the rabi period decreases with higher thz fields ( intermediate fields not shown here ) until for the highest thz field",
    ", all occupation is immediately transfered into higher dark states ( see green line in fig .  [",
    "popbehav]d ) while the 2la incorrectly predicts continued rabi flopping .",
    "despite this limitations , however , the 2la predictions of the rabi splitting ( determined by the rabi period ) are still quite correct .",
    "we have measured the thz - induced changes in the optical transmission for a thz frequency near the excitonic @xmath0-@xmath1 transition frequency . we have observed bleaching and shifting of the @xmath0 exciton peak and pronounced rabi splitting .",
    "in addition , the rabi peaks undergo an anticrossing behavior for a detuning of the thz frequency away from the exciton resonance .",
    "the fully microscopic theory excellently reproduces all experimental features and follows the transition from rabi flopping at low thz intensities to exciton ionization at high intensities .",
    "we also have quantified how a restriction to only two levels ( 2la ) deviates from experiments and the fully microscopic theory .",
    "the 2la works reasonably well for low thz fields where the rabi splitting is weak . for elevated thz fields ,",
    "only the rabi - peak positions are rather close to experimental values while the peak heights are not reproduced .",
    "this systematic analysis closes the gap between earlier studies showing either dressed state behaviour for low thz fields or thz ionization for strong and spectrally broad thz fields .",
