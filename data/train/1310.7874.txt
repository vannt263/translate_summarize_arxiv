    "lvy flights and the associated distributions are object of increasing interest in physics @xcite and other domains , including population migration , economy and medicine , mainly regarding the metastasis spreading in cancer diseases @xcite .",
    "the one - sided lvy processes are substantially different from conventional random walk as they give rise to distributions with longer tails than the heat - type diffusion .",
    "the dynamics underlying this type of process is not fully clarified .",
    "it is however assumed that the equations ruling the evolution of distribution belong to the family of fractional derivative fokker - planck equations .",
    "one of the distinctive features of sub - diffusive dynamics is the appearance of relaxation functions of the stretched exponential form @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 determines the order of the fractional partial differential equation involved in the description of the process . in this paper",
    "we start from the experimental finding that the photoluminescence ( pl ) decay in nanocrystals of silicon is characterized by a stretched exponential law .",
    "subsequently we use the recently obtained exact solutions of lvy one - sided law to derive the analytical expression for the pl decay function .",
    "then we deduce from its behavior the nature of the associated lvy process .",
    "this yields an efficient tool to treat the experimental data and furnishes a consistent physical insight into the process dynamics .    since the first observation of pl from nanostructured porous silicon @xcite there has been increasing interest in the study of the optical properties of this material .",
    "while some authors explained pl phenomena as radiative recombination of charge carriers in a quantum - confined system , the others made defect luminescence responsible for the pl in the nanocrystalline si samples ( si - ncs ) . the optical properties of si - ncs are explained in various ways which encompass exciton migration between interconnected nanocrystals @xcite , variation of the atomic structure of si - ncs of different sizes @xcite , tunneling of carriers from si - ncs to traps in non - radiative process @xcite and many others @xcite .",
    "however , the satisfactory physical explanations underlying the phenomenological description of the photoluminescence relaxation are still absent . in this paper",
    "we will construct the effective model of pl in si - ncs which is based on the anomalous diffusion governed by the lvy stable distributions and the appropriate fractional fokker - planck equations .",
    "we will also verify our approach by comparing with the experimental results .    in many materials with disordered structure",
    "the relaxation phenomena have been found to follow the stretched exponent or the kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) function @xcite @xmath3 with @xmath4 and an effective time constant @xmath5 given by @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 $ ] being the normalization constant of kww and @xmath9 the gamma function .",
    "the kww pattern has been observed in pl phenomena in porous si and nanocrystals si @xcite as well as in various amorphous materials _",
    "e.g. _ in polymers @xcite , glass like materials near the glass transition temperature @xcite and so on . so far the nature of the stretched exponent is not well understood .",
    "the current interpretations of the role played by the kww pl decay law and by the relevant index @xmath2 range from that of a convenient phenomenological tool spoiled of any particular physical significance @xcite , to a deep fundamental problem to be carefully investigated @xcite . in this paper we will discuss a semi - phenomenological model useful , in our opinion , to open a new perspective in understanding of the physical origin of the kww dependence of pl decay in si - ncs .",
    "let us consider the sample consisting of si - ncs embedded in amorphous silica .",
    "because the energy gap in amorphous silica is bigger ( 9 ev @xcite ) than in si - ncs ( 1.5 ev @xcite ) , we can assume that pl decay occurs in si - ncs by means of a kind of debye relaxation .",
    "we hypothesize the existence of de - excitation channels in si - ncs @xcite , so that pl decay origin can be traced back to the electron transitions from the conduction band , through a de - excitation processes where each of them is ruled by debye relaxation .",
    "the ratio of excited emitters to the number of all possible excitations is described as the weighted average of single de - excitations : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an `` effective variable '' describing the @xmath12th de - excitation channel , @xmath13 is a probability density of de - excitation channels of si - ncs and @xmath14 . for",
    "infinitesimally small changes of @xmath11 , eq . reads @xmath15    following the results presented in @xcite , we postulate the equality between eqs .   and .",
    "this means that the stretched exponent is the laplace transform of @xmath16 and , equivalently , @xmath16 is given by its inverse laplace transform @xcite .",
    "mathematically , it results in the conclusion that @xmath16 is uniquely determined @xcite and it is given by the one - sided lvy stable distribution ( lsd ) @xcite . according to the common convention lsd is defined as the inverse laplace transform @xcite .",
    "namely , for @xmath17 we get @xcite @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the identification of the probability density @xmath21 in terms of lvy functions is an important hypothesis .",
    "it does allow : ( a ) the use of well established methods to solve the integral equation in eq . to obtain the explicit form of the function @xmath21 ; ( b ) the possible identification of the process underlying the pl decay in terms of lvy random flights .",
    "up - to - now eq . was usually solved numerically ( _ e.g. _ via stehfest algorithm ) .",
    "recently , two of us found in @xcite the exact and explicit form of lsd for rational @xmath22 , @xmath23 , for integers @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
