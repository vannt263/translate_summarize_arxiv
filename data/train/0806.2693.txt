    "the search for cp - violation ( cpv ) beyond that of the standard model ( sm ) lies at the forefront of nuclear and particle physics .",
    "perhaps the most powerful probes for new cpv are searches for permanent electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron , neutron , and neutral atoms .",
    "null results obtained from these searches have placed stringent constraints on cpv in the strong sector of the sm , while present and expected future sensitivities lie several orders of magnitude away from expectations based on cpv associated with the phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "various scenarios for cpv connected to new physics at or above the electroweak scale naturally imply the existence of non - vanishing edms that could be observed in future experiments .",
    "thus , a comprehensive program of edm searches could uncover either cpv associated with the @xmath4-term \" of the qcd lagrangian , new electroweak scale physics , or both .",
    "each possibility has potentially significant consequences for cosmology .",
    "the peccei - quinn mechanism proposed to explain the vanishingly small value of @xmath5 implies the existence of an axion that could account for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) , while new electroweak scale cpv could help in explaining the observed abundance of baryonic matter through the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis ( ewb ) .    among the most theoretically attractive possibilities for new physics",
    "is supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "susy provides an appealing solution to the naturalness problem of the sm .",
    "however , susy has to be softly broken to be consistent with experimental observations . in order to solve the naturalness problem",
    ", the susy breaking scale should be not much higher than a few tev .",
    "while the exact mechanism of soft susy breaking is not yet known , its effect is encoded into the soft terms in the low - energy realization of this scenario . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "the presence of soft terms implies the existence of 40 additional cpv phases beyond the single phase of the ckm matrix in the sm .",
    "as there exists no known _ a priori _ reason for these phases to be suppressed , one expects rather sizable edms to be generated by one - loop graphs when supersymmetric particle masses are below @xmath6 tev .    however , the current experiment bounds on electron , neutron edm , and @xmath7hg atom are already tight : @xmath8 ( 90% c.l . )",

    "these results imply cpv phases of order @xmath11 or smaller , leading to the so - called susy cp problem `` .",
    "its resolution , as well as that of the related susy flavor problem '' , requires some other mechanism for suppressing one - loop edms ( and one - loop flavor changing neutral currents ) .",
    "one possibility is to take the masses of the first and second generation sfermions to be of order 10 tev @xcite . in such circumstances , the one - loop contributions to edms",
    "are highly suppressed , and the two - loop contributions to edm , with cp violation from either chargino - neutralino sector or the third generation of squarks , may give competitive and even dominate contributions to edms of the electron and neutronhg will be suppressed in this limit , as they are generated primarily by the one - loop chromo - edm operators . ] .",
    "previous work has considered a subset of these two - loop contributions , including those involving third generation squarks @xcite and charginos @xcite whose cpv interactions with the gauge - higgs sector of the mssm induce an edm ( or chromo - edm ) of an elementary , first generation sm fermion . in particular ,",

    ", it has been shown that no cp violation can be propagated though @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 exchanges @xcite , leaving the @xmath17 exchange as the only possibility .",
    "this contribution was recently calculated in ref .",
    "cp violation can also be propagated through the exchange of gauge and higgs boson pairs , including @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath1 , and @xmath23 . here ,",

    "the contributions due to @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 exchanges have been studied @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we compute the remaining two - loop contributions that survive in the limit of large sfermion masses : barr - zee @xcite type amplitudes wherein chargino - neutralino loops communicate cpv to the fermion via the exchange of a @xmath1 or @xmath26 pair .",
    "we also compute the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath22 contributions , and compare our results with the previous computations reported in refs .",
    "we report agreement with all previous results .",
    "we find that , in general , the new contributions are comparable in magnitude to those previously computed , or they are even dominant .",
    "the @xmath1 contribution is accidentally suppressed in the case of the electron edm by the @xmath29 factor , but it is important for the neutron edm . unlike the case of two - loop diagrams with cp violation from squarks , where it has been noted that the @xmath18 and @xmath22 contributions dominate @xcite , we find  after completing a numerical study of the analytic results  that the @xmath23 contribution is among the dominant ones for the electron edm , and both the @xmath30 plus @xmath31 and the @xmath23 contributions are the dominant ones for the neutron edm , proving that the inclusion of these contributions is indispensable .",
    "apart from the implications for edm phenomenology , our results also have interesting consequences for the viability of supersymmetric ewb . indeed ,",
    "part of our original motivation for computing the loops containing the @xmath3 and @xmath2 is that the masses of these scalars affects the dynamics of supersymmetric ewb . in particular , during a first order electroweak phase transition that proceeds via bubble nucleation , the rate at which the neutral higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) change across the bubble walls depends on @xmath32 ( which also sets the scale for @xmath33 ) .",
    "since the cp - violating asymmetries needed for baryon number production are generated during the phase transition by scattering from these vevs , knowledge of the bubble wall profiles and their dependence on the other mssm parameters is essential for determining the viability of supersymmetric ewb . in general ,",
    "susy ewb is enhanced for relatively light @xmath32  a region in which the corresponding @xmath1 , @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath19 and @xmath26 edm contributions are also enhanced . in our numerical study of the two - loop edms , we investigate the corresponding @xmath32-dependence with an eye to these implications for ewb .    our discussion of these points is organized in the remainder of the paper as follows . in section  [ sec : twoloop ] we provide details of our two - loop computation and the analytic expressions for the results .",

    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , while additional technical details are provided in the appendix .",
    "we note that , during the course of completing our study , a parallel computation of the two - loop edms in susy using an effective field theory approach also appeared  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath47 vertex is modified from its standard form in the conventional renormalizable gauges .",
    "a direct  and simplifying  consequence of employing the nonlinear @xmath38 gauge is that the contribution from diagram ( c ) vanishes due to the absence of the @xmath46 coupling .",
    "moreover , an additional simplification can be obtained when carrying out the computation in the landau gauge ( @xmath48 ) . in doing so",

    "the resulting simplification is that the amplitude from fig .",
    "[ fig : loopgraphs](d ) vanishes as well .",

    "first , this choice is potentially compatible with successful ewb .",
    "second , the lightest neutralino relic abundance is close to the observed cold dark matter density @xcite .",
    "if the relic neutralino abundance were larger than the cold dark matter density , a mechanism would be needed to dilute the relic abundance , with implications for ewb as well @xcite .",

    "the size of the two - loop contribution exceeds the experimentally viable values ( which we take to be @xmath147 e cm and @xmath148 e cm ) for a maximal cpv phase .",
    "for each value of the cpv phase , we indicate the boundaries of the excluded region .",
    "the parameter space above the various lines is currently experimentally open even for @xmath149 .    in passing ,",
    "we note that a misalignment of the relative cpv phase between @xmath146 and @xmath150 does not affect our numerical results .",
    "in particular , we find that the main driver for the 2-loop edm we consider here is the relative phase between @xmath150 and @xmath61 , while a negligible contribution originates from the relative phase between @xmath146 and @xmath61 .",
    "this result can potentially have profound implications for the interplay between electro - weak baryogenesis and edm searches , which we plan to explore in a future study .    in summary ,",
    "our numerical results indicate that the new contributions computed here are dominant for the electron and neutron edm at the two - loop level ( in the limit of heavy sfermions ) and should thus be included in any study of edms and cp violation in the mssm .",
    "the analysis we have completed gives the edms of the electron and neutron in the mssm when the sfermion masses are large , leading to a suppression of the one - loop contributions and general dominance of two - loop terms .",
    "considering this regime allows one to circumvent the susy cp problem associated with the present , stringent edm limits and sub - tev scale sfermions .",
    "it also implies vanishing edms for diatomic atoms , assuming they are generated primarily by the chromo - edms of the quarks .",
    "previous studies of this regime have generally also taken all but the lightest , sm - like cp - even scalar to be heavy , thereby suppressing two - loop contributions involving the other higgs scalars as well . in the present study",
    ", we have not made these assumptions and have , instead , analyzed the dependence of the two - loop edms on the full gauge - gaugino - higgs - higgsino parameter space of the mssm .",
    "our primary result is that contributions arising from exchanges involving one sm gauge boson and either the cp - odd neutral scalar , @xmath3 , or the charged higgs scalars , @xmath2 , are comparable or dominant to previously considered contributions . we have also analyzed the prospective implications for mssm electroweak baryogenesis , whose viability depends in part on the values of @xmath112 and @xmath32 .",
    "we leave a thorough exploration of the mssm ewb to a more comprehensive future study @xcite .",
