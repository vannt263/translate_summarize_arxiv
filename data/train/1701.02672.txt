    "smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) is used to discretize and solve partial differential equations governing continuum phenomena , for example the navier stokes equations , on a meshless domain .",
    "sph is widely applied to free surface flows , two phase flows , bounded flows with complex boundary conditions and even complex constitutive models .",
    "the meshless nature of the method opened up avenues for its application to flows involving evolution of non - linear interfaces .",

    "a number of improvements have resulted in application of csf based surface tension models for accurate simulations of two phase flow phenomena @xcite . in these methods ,",
    "the surface tension force is modeled as a volumetric force proportional to the curvature of the interface .",
    "the curvature of the interface is computed either by computation of divergence of a heaviside step function @xcite or by geometrically reconstructing the interface @xcite .",
    "while the former is limited in its application to flows involving a single phase , the latter requires expensive computations to identify particles at the free surface of liquids .",
    "most problems of industrial significance involve two phase flows with large density ratios ( for example , air - water systems ) .",
    "it is therefore a realistic approximation to model these phenomena as free surface flows , where the dynamics due to the lighter phase is neglected .",
    "implementation of accurate surface tension at the free surface in sph has its challenges depending on the method used to model pressure in order to close the navier stokes equations . to achieve incompressibility ,",
    "either a stiff equation of state is used to explicitly compute pressure based on density , or a constraint is applied to the flow field to either maintain an invariance in density or a zero divergence velocity field .",
    "the latter of approach has the advantage of higher accuracy due to smaller pressure fluctuations and greater numerical stability at higher time steps used for time integration @xcite .",
    "when incompressibility is achieved using a stiff equation of state , the resulting weakly compressible sph model @xcite satisfies stress balance at the interface naturally @xcite , due to conservative pressure gradient approximation available in sph literature .",
    "application of free surface surface tension models is straight forward in this case and different surface tension models have been successfully implemented @xcite .",
    "however , when incompressibility is realized by treating pressure as a lagrange multiplier to impose an incompressibility constraint , the resulting linear system requires explicit application of dirichlet boundary condition for pressure at the free surface @xcite . a number of works presented imposition of boundary pressure values on particles identified as free surface in order to solve the pressure poisson equation .",
    "this approach abated the high order of accuracy possible with isph over the wcsph method @xcite .",
    "also , surface tension models require unrestrained flow along the interface and the imposition of constant pressure at the interface particles is therefore incompatible with surface tension models .    a semi - analytical freesurface model that computes kernel deficiency to impose dirichlet boundary condition at the free surface was presented in a recent work @xcite .",
    "this free surface models obviates the need to identify particles or apply dirichlet boundary condition explicitly on particles .",

    "mesh based methods , which pin a contact angle at the three phase contact point , require special treatment for slip near solid walls @xcite . on the other hand , using pairwise forces",
