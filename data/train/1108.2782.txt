    "deviations from the exponential decay law of unstable systems are a natural consequence of the postulates of quantum mechanics @xcite : for an unstable state , whose average energy is finite , the survival probability for short times after the creation  of the state is slower than any exponential decay law . in other terms , if we introduce an effective , time dependent decay rate @xmath0 one has that for @xmath1 , @xmath2 while at large times the standard exponential decay law , @xmath3 , is obtained .",
    "the initial temporal window for which deviations from the exponential law take place is usually very small : it is of the order of @xmath4 sec for electromagnetic atomic decays @xcite .",
    "this explains why these deviations have never been observed in experiments before 1997 @xcite when , for the first time , a cold atoms experiment has reported the evidence of such deviations for bona fide  unstable states ( tunneling of atoms out of a trap ) .",
    "previously , in @xcite , deviations from the exponential law have been reported within rabi oscillations .",
    "the short time deviations from the exponential law open up the possibility of the so called quantum zeno effect @xcite : by observing  the system with pulsed measurements at short times after its preparation , the effective decay rate is reduced and eventually it vanishes for continuous measurements ( quantum zeno paradox ) .",
    "also this prediction has been recently confirmed within cold atoms experiments @xcite and , moreover , the so called inverse quantum zeno effect has also been observed : in this case the measuring apparatus leads to a faster decay of the unstable state @xcite .",
    "a natural question concerns the existence of deviations from the exponential law also in the context of relativistic quantum field theory ( rqft ) which is the right theoretical frame for describing unstable particles . in the perturbative approaches presented in @xcite no ( or very much suppressed ) short - time deviations from the exponential law , and thus no quantum zeno effect ,",
    "were found within rqft . here and in ref .",
    "@xcite we reconsider the issue of the survival probability in rqft also by analyzing some subtleties one faces when trying to define unstable particles , such as the problem of preparation of the system  and of the fields redefinition .",
    "we will not consider here the case of the fundamental lagrangian of the standard model but we limit the discussion to a toy model superrenormalizable lagrangian .",
    "we indeed find that deviations from the exponential law occur also in a genuine rqft context and we discuss possible implications for hadronic decays .",
    "the toy lagrangian we use to investigate the survival probability of an unstable scalar particle @xmath5 decaying into two scalars @xmath6 is given by : @xmath7 the interaction term @xmath8 is responsible for the decay process @xmath9 , whose tree - level decay rate reads : @xmath10 the ` naive ' , tree - level expression of the survival probability @xmath11 for the resonance @xmath5 created at @xmath12 is @xmath13 and the tree - level expression of the mean life time is @xmath14 . here",
    "we interpret our lagrangian as an effective model to describe the decays of hadrons ; it is therefore quite natural to introduce a cutoff @xmath15 on the energy of the particles of the typical mass scale of strongly interacting particles i.e. @xmath16 gev . to introduce the cutoff in a more consistent way one has to insert a nonlocal interaction in the lagrangian @xcite : @xmath17@xmath18 where",
    "@xmath19 is a form factor whose fourier transform , @xmath20 , appears in the loop integrals and regularizes the divergences .",
    "( for nonlocal lagrangians see also refs . @xcite and refs . therein . ) in this work we will consider the case of a sharp cutoff and the case of a smooth form factor . an intermediate step to obtain the survival probability is the computation of the self energy which reads : @xmath21   \\left [   ( -q+p/2)^{2}-m^{2}+i\\varepsilon\\right ]   } % \\ ] ] and modifies the propagator @xmath22 of the unstable particle as usual : @xmath23   ^{-1}\\text{.}%\\ ] ]",
    "similarly to the standard derivation within quantum mechanics , also in rqft , the survival probability can be obtained by projecting the initial unstable state onto the energy eigenstates . in turn",
    ", this corresponds to the calculation of the spectral function @xmath24 of the scalar field @xmath5 which is proportional to the imaginary part of the propagator:@xmath25\\right\\vert \\text { .}%\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath26 represents the probability that , in its rest frame , the state @xmath5 has a mass between @xmath27 and @xmath28 it is correctly normalized for each @xmath29 , @xmath30 and reproduces the limit @xmath31 for @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "notice that there are situations in which the the spectral function can be directly pin down by data because the the background is small and well understood : the decay @xmath33 through the intermediate @xmath34 and @xmath35 mesons , the similar decay of the @xmath36 charmonium , or the hadronic decay of the @xmath37 lepton into @xmath38 dominated by the @xmath39 meson for an invariant @xmath40 mass close to @xmath39 mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the probability amplitude @xmath41 and the survival probability @xmath11 can be then expressed as @xmath42 the condition @xmath43 is fulfilled in virtue of the normalization of @xmath24 .",
    "let us now study the first derivative of @xmath11 .",
    "we obtain that @xmath44 as a consequence of the fact that the integral @xmath45 is finite and real ( it is the mean mass @xmath46 , a reasonable definition for the mass of a resonance @xcite ) .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the function @xmath47 vanishes for @xmath1:@xmath48 we can therefore conclude that the quantum zeno effect is perfectly possible in the present rqft context .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the survival probability for the case of a sharp cutoff ( solid line ) a smooth form factor @xmath49 ( thick gray line ) and the standard exponential decay law ( dashed line ) , here @xmath50 gev , @xmath51 gev , @xmath52 and the tree level mean life time @xmath53 gev@xmath54 ( this fixes @xmath29 in the two cases ) . also displayed are the differences between the survival probability as calculated at one loop level and the tree level exponential decay law ( dotted black and gray lines ) .",
    "notice that the time interval for which sizable deviations from the exponential decay law occur is of the same order of magnitude of the mean life time of the particle .",
    "this is an intriguing consequence of having strongly interacting particles and could in principle lead to observable effects , for instance in heavy ions collisions experiments .",
    "moreover , the difference between the sharp and smooth cutoff is very small : this fact ensures that our results depend only slightly from the form of the cutoff function .",
    "there is an important issue that must be considered in connection with the measurability of these deviations , which also correspond to the measurability of the spectral function .",
    "first , we notice that for very broad resonances , for which the deviation from the exponential law are strong , one should also consider the mechanism by which these resonances are created as , for instance , the scattering @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "one should introduce wave packets , with proper initial conditions , which substantially overlap at @xmath12 . in the framework of plane waves",
    ", the full state of the system can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath56 :",
    "@xmath57 the coefficient @xmath58 is vanishingly small for @xmath59 and only for @xmath60 it becomes significant .",
    "if it were possible to tune the starting conditions in such a way that @xmath61 we would have @xmath62 and the survival probability of the resonance would be exactly the one presented in the previous section .",
    "however , in general the state at @xmath12 is a superposition : @xmath63 further evolution implies : @xmath64 the amplitude @xmath41 enters in a more general expression but it is not clear a priori if the deviations from the exponential decay law are smeared out , in the final measurement  of the decay products , or if they could provide significant effects .",
    "a careful study would be needed .",
    "moreover , we plan also to investigate if the deviations from the exponential decay law could indeed lead to observable effects also in particle physics experiments .",
