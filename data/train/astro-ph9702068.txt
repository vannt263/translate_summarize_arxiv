    "an accretion disk with a dissipative , thermal corona has recently become a popular model for interpreting the uv / x/@xmath2-ray spectra from seyfert galaxies and galactic black hole candidates ( see , e.g. , svensson 1996 ) .",
    "recent studies have focused on the correct description of the spectrum from such a system ( e.g. , stern et al .",
    "1995 , poutanen & svensson 1996 , sincell & krolik 1997 ) whereas relatively little effort has been taken to achieve a physically self - consistent internal structure of the corona . in particular , most of the existing models of disk - corona systems involve two simplifying assumptions : isothermal structure of the corona , and purely radiative energy exchange between the corona and the disk .",
    "we relax the above assumptions by considering effects of thermal conduction , which will obviously occur in a hot corona situated above the surface of a cold disk .",
    "such a treatment allows us to determine self - consistently the electron density and temperature distributions in the corona .",
    "we consider two limiting cases : a corona consisting purely of electron - positron pairs , and a corona without pairs ( a pure electron - proton plasma ) .",
    "the calculations of thermal pair equilibria ( e.g. , stern et al .",
    "1995 ) show that both cases ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 dominated coronae ) may be expected in accreting black hole systems , depending on both the compactness ( defined below ) and the temperature .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 coronae satisfy the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium . for @xmath3 coronae ,",
    "the hydrostatic model is inconsistent and large - scale coronal expansion is expected , as we discuss in section 2.5 . leaving the investigation of the exact structure of pair coronae for future studies , we consider here a constant pressure structure to see what effect conduction may have in the presence of pairs .",
    "we assume that the corona has a slab geometry with a scale height @xmath5 and a surface area @xmath6 .",
    "we also assume a sandwich geometry ( coronae located on both sides of the disk ) so that we can consider only half of such a plane symmetrical system .",
    "the plasma in the corona is assumed to be optically thin ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the total optical depth , @xmath9 is the electron density , and @xmath10 is the distance from the corona bottom ) and to have a thermal distribution of electron energies ( with the temperature varying across the corona ) .",
    "these assumptions are supported by observations of seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , zdziarski et al .",
    "1995 ; gondek et al .",
    "1996 ) and galactic black hole candidates ( e.g. , gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ) , whose spectra are well fitted by optically thin thermal comptonization .",
    "we measure the electron density and the temperature of the plasma by the following dimensionless parameters , @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 . the latter parameter is the differential thomson depth at @xmath14 in the interval @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "following haardt & maraschi ( 1991 , 1993 ) , we assume that most of the accretion energy is dissipated in the corona .",
    "the dissipated power is lost due to thermal conduction and radiation losses .",
    "half of the high energy radiation from the corona irradiates the cold disk and the other half escapes directly from the source ( we neglect for simplicity the anisotropy of the scattering process in the corona and reflection of hard photons from the cold matter ) .",
    "the coronal radiation intercepted by the disk is reprocessed and reemitted at much lower energies , which provides soft seed photons for comptonization in the corona .",
    "the dissipated power , @xmath18 , and both the corona and disk radiation luminosities , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , are characterized by compactness parameters : @xmath21 [ @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to the total power of radiation emitted by one side of the corona and the disk , while the observed luminosities of those layers are described by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . ]",
    "our main parameter is , however , the local dissipative compactness parameter ( introduced by bjrnsson & svensson 1992 ) , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and thus @xmath26 this parameter is crucial for determining the efficiency of radiative processes in the corona , since it involves the luminosity in a cubic volume with the size @xmath5 , which is the characteristic local volume in the corona .",
    "analogously , we define the local radiative compactnesses , @xmath27    we emphasize the importance of the difference between the local compactness and global compactness , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the distance from the central source , in the corona geometry ( see also gondek et al .",
    "it is the local compactness which is the most relevant for parameterizing the character of the coronal thermal and pair balance , which fact is clear from the form of our equations ( [ e1][e3 ] ) below .",
    "it is equally true for other problems , for example , for the issue of whether the electrons in the corona can achieve a thermal distribution function ( cf .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "the electron distribution function is determined by a competition between the electron - electron relaxation timescale ( determined by the electron density and mean energy ) and the electron cooling timescale ( which depends on the radiation energy density ) .",
    "their ratio is then a function of the optical depth and the _ local _ compactness , not the _ global _ compactness .",
    "since @xmath30 is always smaller than @xmath31 , and sometimes very much smaller , this can be an important distinction .",
    "the cooling time becomes relatively longer as @xmath32 falls , so using @xmath31 instead of @xmath30 can lead to a spurious difficulty in achieving an equilibrium distribution function",
    ".    the importance of the conduction process will be measured by the fraction of the dissipated power transported out of the corona by the conductive flux , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the heat flux through the corona bottom .",
    "taking into account both the radiative energy exchange and the conductive transport of thermal energy , we can relate the corona and disk luminosities to the dissipated power , @xmath35 ( we neglected here the initial energy of soft photons scattered in the corona as they contribute negligibly to the corona luminosity ) .",
    "then @xmath36      we assume that all electrons in the corona are heated at a constant rate , @xmath2 .",
    "then the heating rate per unit volume is , @xmath37 which corresponds to a local dissipative compactness , @xmath38 where @xmath39      radiative cooling in the corona is due to unsaturated comptonization and bremsstrahlung .",
    "the compton cooling rate is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the radiation energy density , @xmath42 is the electron density , and the expressions in parentheses give the average relative photon energy gain per scattering in the nonrelativistic ( @xmath43 ) and relativistic ( @xmath44 ) cases , respectively ( for @xmath45 , we use @xmath46 in order to achieve a smooth transition between the two regimes ) .",
    "we take into account cooling of electrons on both soft photons from the disk and photons already scattered in the corona . as photons scattered many times in the corona",
    "may enter the klein - nishina regime , we include only photons satisfying the condition @xmath47 where @xmath48",
    ". then , @xmath49 where the fraction of the energy density that scatters in the thomson regime is @xmath50 @xmath51 is the energy spectrum of the hard radiation from the corona [ we assume a power - law spectrum with the energy index given by eqs .  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in zdziarski et al . ( 1994 ) and an exponential cut - off at @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the soft photons energy .",
    "the bremsstrahlung cooling rate is @xmath54 where    @xmath55 ,                                              & $ \\theta \\ge 1 $ ,   \\cr } \\label{lb}\\ ] ]    and @xmath56 is the fine - structure constant ( svensson 1982 ) .",
    "the classical heat flux is expressed by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the thermal conductivity . in a fully ionized hydrogen plasma , @xmath59 where the parameter @xmath60 allows for a reduction of the heat flux by magnetic fields , turbulence etc .",

    "the classical expression for the heat flux is based on the assumption that the electron mean free path is short compared to the temperature height scale , @xmath67 . in the limit",
    "@xmath68 the heat flux is said to be  saturated \" , and cowie & mckee ( 1977 ) suggested the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath71 is the mean mass per particle ( @xmath72 for @xmath4 plasmas and @xmath73 for @xmath3 plasmas ) , @xmath74 is the mass density and @xmath75 parametrizes the uncertainty of the appropriate value of @xmath76 .",
    "both experimental and theoretical results constrain @xmath75 to the range @xmath77@xmath78 with some preference for the value of @xmath79 ( balbus & mckee 1982 ; giuliani 1984 ) .",
    "we use here @xmath79 but test the sensitivity of the results to the value of @xmath75 . the saturated heat flux given by eq .",
    "( [ qsat ] ) corresponds to advection of the plasma s thermal energy at a rate comparable to the sound speed . in order to smoothly implement the transition from classical diffusive to saturated trasport ,",

    "for an electron - proton corona , the condition @xmath90 is satisfied and the following approximate form of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation may be used , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the pressure in the corona and @xmath93 is the distance of the corona bottom from the disk midplane .",

    "( [ qa ] ) ( with @xmath96 , as found in section 4 ) , we find that the gas pressure dominates for @xmath97 . at higher compactnesses",

    "for an isothermal corona the above equation gives , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the ( constant ) temperature of the corona . in section 4",
    "we find that thermal conduction significantly affects the corona structure near its base in a way that may increase the corona total optical depth .",
    "however , the temperature at higher altitudes is roughly constant and the density profile does not differ from that found in isothermal approximation .",
    "therefore , we use the scale hight determined by eq .",
    "( [ hr ] ) , approximating @xmath104 by the temperature at the top of the corona , @xmath105 ( see section 2.7 ) .",
    "the distance , @xmath93 , is the sum of the disk height , @xmath106 , and the height of the transition layer affected by thermal conduction , @xmath107 . using the results of svensson & zdziarski ( 1994 )",
    ", we find that the ratio of corona height to disk height is @xmath108 .",
    "the value of @xmath107 is determined by the solution of the conduction problem and ( as we find in section 4 ) typically @xmath109 when conduction is important . in this case ,",
    "the value of @xmath93 is dominated by the height of the transition layer .",
    "the exact value can be obtained with additional parameters of the model ( accretion rate , viscosity parameter etc . )",
    "necessary for the calculation of @xmath106 .    for electron - positron coronae ,",
    "the gravitational force acting on the corona is too small to keep it bound because the escape speed is @xmath110 , whereas the sound speed is @xmath111 and compton equilibrium generically gives temperatures @xmath112 not much less than unity .",
    "consequently , in a pure pair plasma @xmath113 and strong outflows can be expected unless the plasma is confined by magnetic fields .    in order to check the importance of thermal conduction in pair coronae ,",
    "we consider here a zone of @xmath3 plasma at low altitudes above the disk ( as it is unlikely that the heating mechanism operates at large distances from the disk ) close to hydrostatic equilibrium so that the corona exists . as the pressure gradient induced by",
    "the pair gravity is negligible , we expect that such a zone is almost isobaric and so we will describe that zone by eq.([eq2 ] ) with the null gravity term ( the second term in brackets ) .      as we find in section 4 below",
    ", the bottom of the corona is much hotter than the disk .",
    "thus a transition layer between the disk and the corona must exist over which the temperature decreases from the coronal to disk value .",
    "decrease of the temperature in the transition layer is accompanied by a decrease of conductive heat flux , as the energy transported from the disk is gradually radiated away . at some point",
    "the conductive flux vanishes and the temperature levels off at a value determined by the balance between radiative heating and cooling .",
    "we call this point the base of the transition layer . below the base",
    "the temperature is still higher than the  normal \" disk temperature , due to compton heating by the coronal radiation .",
    "we do not investigate properties of that compton heated layer as atomic processes ( which are neglected in this paper ) may become important there ( a detailed analysis of such regions has recently been done by raska & czerny 1996 and sincell & krolik 1997 ) .      while for @xmath4 coronae the transition layer will obviously consist of an electron - proton plasma , the composition of the transition layer for @xmath3 coronae is rather uncertain and depends on the mechanism of formation of the transition layer .",
    "if it is formed by the heating of the outer parts of the accretion disk , we can expect that it is composed mostly of @xmath4 with some addition of pairs inflowing from the corona . on the other hand",
    ", the transition layer may be formed together with the active region and then it would be dominated by electron - positron plasma .",
    "we will examine here the latter possibility ( by assuming that both the corona and the transition layer consist only of @xmath3 plasma ) to estimate the maximum effect of thermal conduction , which is achieved for a pure pair plasma ( see section 4 ) .",

    "give three first - order differential equations , @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 , \\label{e3}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ f ] ) and ( [ f1 ] ) for the corona and the transition layer , respectively , and @xmath125 the null value of @xmath126 for @xmath3 coronae results from the isobaric approximation , whereas @xmath127 for @xmath4 coronae .",
    "we solve the above equations for @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "we are solving three first - order differential equations which depend on two dimensionless parameters , @xmath131 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in addition to choosing the parameters , we must also choose three boundary conditions , @xmath105 , @xmath132 , and @xmath130 at the top of the corona , which we call @xmath133 .",
    "the physically appropriate choice for the temperature gradient is obvious .",
    "there should be no heat flux at the top of the corona , so @xmath134    the other boundary conditions are subtler to determine . in the absence of conduction ,",
    "the temperature throughout the corona would be determined by @xmath0 and @xmath131 .",
    "this is the calculation performed in numerous other discussions of accretion disk coronae .",
    "however , heat conduction removes some heat from the corona , decreasing its temperature , and we do not know how much this affects the top of the corona before doing the calculation .",
    "we implicitly fix @xmath105 by setting the temperature at the bottom of the transition layer to be effectively zero , or at least far below the coronal temperature .",
    "the value used to initiate the integration is then a parameter to be iterated on until self - consistency ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "the third boundary condition , @xmath133 , may be thought of as the density at the top of the corona .",
    "because we have normalized our unit of distance to the scale height , it is implicitly fixed by @xmath131 . in the case of an @xmath4 plasma ,",
    "the density profile of the corona is approximately gaussian ( it would be exactly gaussian if the temperature were exactly independent of height ) , so formally the corona extends to infinity .",
    "however , we must choose some finite number of scale lengths at which to bound our calculation .",
    "we do so by setting the differential thomson depth at the top @xmath135 .",
    "if the corona were exactly isothermal , this would be achieved at @xmath136 , so by starting the integration at @xmath137 with @xmath138 , all would be self - consistent . to account for the deviations from isothermality induced by conduction ,",
    "we iterate on @xmath137 , keeping @xmath133 fixed at 0.0001 . in the case of a pair plasma",
    ", our constant pressure assumption translates to a density profile which approaches closer and closer to a step - function in the limit as the temperature profile approaches isothermal .",
    "we therefore start the calculation at @xmath139 and assume an initial value of the coronal pressure .",
    "then we adjust the value of the pressure to obtain the assumed @xmath131 .    the optical depth , @xmath131 , and the local compactness , @xmath140 , of the corona are the main parameters of the model .",
    "@xmath141 is also a free parameter , but its value can be determined for a specific disk model , as discussed in section 2.5 .",
    "increase of @xmath141 results in a slight increase of @xmath142 , due to the change of the density profile in the corona .",
    "the solution of the transition layer structure gives an obvious constraint on the value of @xmath141 , which must exceed the height of the transition layer .",
    "we assume an initial value of @xmath142 , which determines @xmath143 and @xmath144 from eq .",
    "( [ qa ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath145 follows from eq .",
    "( [ ee ] ) .",
    "summarizing , our model has three free parameters , @xmath131 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 . in calculations , we first adjust @xmath105 and @xmath137 ( or @xmath146 for @xmath3 coronae ) as described above",
    ". then the value of @xmath142 from the solution with adjusted @xmath105 and @xmath137 is used in the next iteration .",
    "the procedure ends when the calculated value of @xmath142 converges .",
    "as discussed in appendix a , once the three free parameters are specified , there is a ( narrow ) allowed range @xmath147 ( and a corresponding range of @xmath137 ) within which acceptable solutions exist .",
    "the members of this solution family are distinguished by the pressure at the bottom of the transition zone .    for @xmath4 coronae we computed solutions for @xmath148 , while in the pair case we found solutions for @xmath149 .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath0 was suggested by both the observational results [ see , e.g. , table 1 in done & fabian ( 1989 ) noting that the local compactness is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the global compactness given there ] and theoretical expectations [ for slab coronae @xmath150 corresponds to @xmath151 ( see section 5 ) which is unlikely in agns ] .",
    "note that for @xmath152 the corona may still be pair dominated ( see , e.g. , figure 1 in stern et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the upper limits are set by the character of our solutions : at higher @xmath0 conduction becomes negligible ( see below ) . for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 coronae , the optical depth range over which we computed solutions was @xmath153 .",
    "we find that heat flux saturation puts an important constraint on the conduction problem in that it establishes a limit on the amount of thermal energy that can be transported out of the corona .",
    "namely , the conductive heat flux at the bottom can not exceed the saturated heat flux , @xmath154 as this limit is independent of the total amount of released power , the relative importance of the thermal conduction process increases with decreasing compactness .",
    "the maximum fraction of the released power that can leave the corona in the form of conductive flux is , @xmath155 as discussed below , the temperature can not differ strongly from the compton equilibrium value , which can be estimated from @xmath156 ( pietrini and krolik 1995 ) .",
    "then @xmath157 [ eq .  ( [ qa ] ) ] implies , @xmath158 where we assumed @xmath79 . as @xmath159 in both seyfert galaxies and black hole binaries ( e.g. , zdziarski et al .",
    "1997 ) , we find that conduction has a rather minor effect ( transporting less than 5 per cent of the released power ) for @xmath160 and @xmath161 for electron - positron and electron - proton plasmas , respectively .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the dependence of @xmath142 on @xmath0 .",
    "the relation suggested by eq .",
    "( [ ratio1 ] ) , @xmath162 , appears to be valid for @xmath163 and @xmath164 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 plasmas , respectively . for lower values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the dependence rolls over to approach the classical heat flux case in the limit of very small compactness ( in numerical calculations we obtain the classical heat flux limit by setting @xmath165 ) . figure 3 shows the dependence of @xmath142 on @xmath131 . for lower local compactness parameters , @xmath142 decreases with increasing @xmath131 due to a higher radiative cooling efficiency of the corona . for higher",
    "@xmath0 ( in the saturation regime ) , @xmath142 is only weakly dependent on @xmath166 ; an increase of the cooling efficiency with @xmath131 is compensated by an increase of the saturated heat flux ( due to the increase of @xmath130 ) .",
    "solid curves on figures 4 and 5 show the temperature , the dimensionless electron density and the heat flux profiles in the corona ( @xmath167 ) and in the transition layer ( @xmath168 ) obtained within our thermal conduction model .",
    "the dashed curves show the solutions of the model in which conduction is neglected ( the temperature here is determined by the equilibrium between heating and cooling ) .",
    "saturation prevents the temperature in the corona from being much lower than the compton equilibrium temperature .",
    "namely , a decrease of the temperature results in a decrease of the radiative cooling efficiency , which increases the amount of energy that must be taken out of the corona by the conductive flux .",
    "this quickly exceeds the capability of the saturated transport .",
    "the amount by which the corona temperature may deviate from the compton equilibrium value depends on the local compactness . at values of @xmath0",
    "for which conduction is important , the difference may become significant ( figures 4 and 5 , left panels ) . in this case",
    ", conduction leads to an observationally interesting effect of the softening of the spectrum , as a lower plasma temperature is achieved while the optical depth remains unchanged . for higher compactness parameters ,",
    "only a tiny difference is possible and then most of the coronal emission comes from a roughly isothermal region ( figures 4 and 5 , right panels ) .",
    "the transition layer formed below the base of the corona has a relatively high temperature and may extend over a height of a few tenths of the corona height scale , as shown by solid curves at @xmath168 on figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the existence of such a layer was overlooked in previous studies of the disk - corona interface ( e.g. , shimura et al .",
    "1995 ) as they neglected conduction , which appears to provide the major contribution of energy to that region . indeed , by comparing the energy input to the transition layer due to the maximum ( saturated ) value of conductive flux with the energy input due to heat flux of coronal radiation , we find that @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the optical depth of the transition layer and @xmath171 is given by eq .",
    "( [ vareps ] ) . from this",
    "we find that , e.g. , for the parameters of the model shown on the right panel of figure 4 conduction provides 10 times more energy than compton heating .",
    "the weak contribution of compton heating is due to the fact that the average energy of photons emitted by unsaturated comptonization is much lower than the average electron energy in that plasma .",
    "then , if a purely radiative energy exchange between two phases of a plasma occurs , the irradiated phase achieves a much lower temperature than the hot one . for a disk - corona system",
    "this would lead to a sharp decline in the temperature profile , as shown by dashed curves on figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the optical depth and compton parameter , @xmath172 , of the transition layer decrease with increasing local compactness ( because a lower @xmath173 is needed at higher luminosity for the loss of the transported energy ) , e.g. @xmath174 and @xmath175 for parameters yielding @xmath176 , while @xmath177 and @xmath178 for @xmath179 .",
    "a few solutions corresponding to different @xmath105 are shown on the left panel of figure 5 .",
    "the solutions belonging to the same family may have @xmath173 differing by a few percent depending on the relative importance of comptonization and bremsstrahlung in the loss of transported energy ( see appendix a ) .",
    "each of these solutions has slightly different pressure at the base of the transition layer , which corresponds to a dimensionless ionization parameter @xmath180 the actual solution of the corona structure is determined by the disk solution , in particular by the resulting value of the ionization parameter at the top of the disk .",
    "the value of the ionization parameter at the base of transition layer is relatively sensitive to the value of @xmath105 , as e.g.  a relative change of the top temperature , @xmath181 , results in a change of ionization parameter , @xmath182 , while the transported power varies then by only @xmath183 .    as discussed in section 2.4 , the value of @xmath75 is not exactly determined .",
    "therefore , we checked the sensitivity of the results to the value of @xmath75 ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "it appears that the level of that sensitivity is determined by the optical depth of the corona .",
    "for higher optical depths ( @xmath184 ) , the solution depends very weakly on the exact value of @xmath75",
    ". however , for low optical depth ( @xmath185 ) , @xmath142 increases significantly with increasing @xmath75 for @xmath186 , but levels off at higher @xmath75 .",
    "we have developed a model of thermal conduction in a hot , active region situated above the surface of much colder matter .",
    "the model is applicable to regions with approximately plane parallel geometry so that the heat conduction equation may be reduced to one dimension .",
    "it applies also to localized active regions with , e.g. , pillbox geometry ( stern et al . 1995 ) , except for eq.([lhs ] ) in which the deficit of soft photons must be taken into account .",
    "the importance of thermal conduction in accretion disk coronae depends strongly on the local compactness parameter . for @xmath4 plasma",
    "the conduction has a negligible effect for @xmath187 independent of other parameters .",
    "pairs increase the importance of conduction by raising the sound speed , and therefore the maximum ( saturated ) heat flux .",
    "our approach to pair coronae is highly simplified ( a pure @xmath3 corona and an @xmath3 transition layer , no energy losses in a coronal wind ) and is aimed to estimate the maximum effect of thermal conduction . even in this highly idealized situation , conduction is important only for @xmath188 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 , crucial for the conduction problem , depends on the luminosity and geometrical parameters of the active region .",
    "e.g. , for an electron - proton corona extending over the total surface of the accretion disk ( @xmath189 ) we find from the definition of the local compactness , using eq .",
    "( [ hr ] ) and @xmath190 , @xmath191 then for @xmath192 and @xmath193 we can expect local compactnesses ranging from 0.02 to 54 . in this case conduction is important for @xmath194 , a condition which may apply in at least some agn . on the other hand , a luminosity of @xmath195 is typical , e.g. , for the hard state of the galactic black hole candidate cyg x-1 ( e.g. , phlips et al .",
    "thus , conduction is likely to be important in at least some agns and galactic black hole candidates .",
    "when conduction becomes important , a nonuniform temperature distribution is established in the corona .",
    "in addition , a relatively hot transition layer between the corona and the disk is formed . in this case",
    ", the coronal radiation has a spectrum steeper than in models without conduction ( with the same @xmath131 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , the spectrum will have a more complicated form than a simple power - law .",
    "in particular , we expect a soft power - law - like emission from the transition layer due to comptonization of soft photons from the disk in addition to the coronal emission",
    ". the spectral index of this emission should be larger than the spectral index of the coronal emission , as the compton parameter of the transition layer is lower than the compton parameter of the corona , except for very low local compactness @xmath196 .",
    "the superposition of the transition layer component on the spectrum of the coronal radiation ( the latter extends to higher energies due to higher temperature in the corona ) is a possible explanation of the formation of soft x - ray excesses , observed in many agns at energies below @xmath197 kev ( e.g. , wilkes & elvis 1987 ; turner & pounds 1989 ) . when conduction is not important , the corona is isothermal and a rather sharp transition occurs at the corona base to the region in radiative equilibrium",
    "this research has been supported by polish kbn grants 2p03d01008 and 2p03d01111 and nasa grant nagw-3156 .",
    "we discuss here the criteria for adjusting @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath105 determines the fraction of energy released in the corona that must be transported out of corona by conduction . for a lower @xmath198 ,",
    "comptonization is less efficient and a higher flux must be carried down at lower plasma conductivity ( @xmath199 ) , which requires higher temperature gradient .",
    "thus the decrease of @xmath105 implies both the increase of the heat flux at the corona bottom , @xmath34 , and the decrease of the temperature at the corona bottom , @xmath200 .",
    "the total energy transported by conductive flux is radiated away in the transition layer . at the base of the transition",
    "layer the solution should have a vanishing conductive flux ( as no flux can be transported further down due to very small plasma conductivity ) and small temperature ( determined by radiative equilibrium ) .",
    "below we present analytic solutions for the transition layer structure in certain approximations to show qualitative properties of the solution , which constrain the possible value of @xmath105 .",
    "we consider the classical heat flux limit approximation with constant pressure , @xmath201const , and we neglect compton heating .",
    "below we use the dimensionless heat flux and pressure , @xmath202 @xmath203 for most of the transition layer , the temperature is sufficiently high ( and the electron density sufficiently low ) for cooling to be completly dominated by comptonization .",
    "we consider then the heat transfer equation with the cooling term determined by compton cooling , @xmath204 eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) , with the boundary conditions determined by the solution at the corona bottom , @xmath205 and @xmath200 , have the following solution @xmath206 where @xmath207 .",
    "we see that for a given value of @xmath205 there is a unique value of @xmath208^{2/7}$ ] for which vanishing of @xmath209 at the bottom of the transition layer is accompanied by @xmath112 decreasing to a very small value . for higher @xmath200 temperature does not decrease and if we tried to prolong the solution further down the temperature would increase implying a negative temperature gradient .",
    "the physical meaning of that class of solutions [ with @xmath210 is that conductive transport from the disk is required , in addition to @xmath205 , in order to provide sufficient amount of energy to the transition layer to balance the compton cooling rate determined by @xmath200 . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath211 the temperature vanishes before the transported thermal energy can be radiated away due to comptonization ( in this case , the decrease of @xmath112 to zero is accompanied with divergence of @xmath212 fast enough to keep the heat flux at a finite value ) .",
    "the decrease of @xmath112 implies , however , the increase of @xmath130 and thus bremsstrahlung becomes efficient as a cooling mechanism . to check whether bremsstrahlung may provide sufficiently high cooling rate for the loss of the rest of the transported thermal energy we consider the heat conduction equation with the cooling term determined by bremsstrahlung .",
    "we use the bremsstrahlung cooling rate for the nonrelativistic case and neglect the second term in parentheses in eq .",
    "( [ lb ] ) , namely @xmath213 , for calculational simplicity . then , @xmath214 where @xmath215 . eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) have the solution , @xmath216 ^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath217 and @xmath218 are the heat flux and the temperature at the point where bremsstrahlung starts to dominate . for @xmath219 ,",
    "the energy transported by the conductive flux can not be radiated away .",
    "this means that certain @xmath220 exists such that for lower @xmath200 no acceptable solution exists , because @xmath217 and @xmath218 are positively correlated with @xmath205 and @xmath200 , respectively .    the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ e1][e3 ] ) has the same qualitative properties as the approximation we investigated above .",
    "a certain range of the values of @xmath200 exists then , @xmath221 , for which we obtain physically acceptable solutions . for lower @xmath200 ,",
    "the energy that enters the transition layer can not be radiated away and as a result the temperature in the layer would increase leading to the increase of @xmath200 . on the other hand ,",
    "for higher @xmath200 the energy delivered to the layer is too low to maintain its temperature and the temperature would decrease .",
    "solutions corresponding to different @xmath222 differ with respect to the relative importance of bremsstrahlung and compton cooling in the loss of transported energy .",
    "as discussed above , the decrease of @xmath105 implies a decrease of @xmath200 and an increase of @xmath205 . as the value of @xmath205",
    "is constrained by the saturation effect ( see section 4 ) , the above constraints on @xmath200 imply the existence of a certain range of the values of @xmath198 for which the correct behaviour of the solution in the transition layer can be obtained . in our calculation procedure ( section 2.7 ) , we determine this range by looking at the behaviour of the solution at the bottom end for different values of @xmath105 .",
