    "the galactic chemical evolution is the study of the transformation of gas into stars and the resulting evolution of the chemical composition of a galaxy .",
    "the so called `` simple model '' remains an useful guide for understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies since the pioneering works of schmidt ( 1963 ) , searle & sargent ( 1972 ) , tinsley ( 1974 ) , pagel & patchett ( 1975 ) . in order to derive analytical solutions for the chemical evolution of galaxies",
    "one needs to make several hypotheses : the initial mass function ( imf ) should be considered constant , the lifetime of stars should be neglected ( instantaneous recycling approximation , ira ) , and the complete mixing of chemical elements with the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "these assumptions , in fact , allow us to have analytical expressions for the metallicity evolution of the galaxies in time and in terms of the gas fraction",
    ". one can find analytical solutions even in presence of gas flows ( infall , outflow , galactic fountains ) as shown by tinsley ( 1980 ) , clayton ( 1988 ) , lacey & fall ( 1985 ) , matteucci & chiosi ( 1983 ) , edmunds ( 1990 ) , recchi et al .",

    "( 2015 ) .",
    "however , in all mentioned works the solutions are obtained only under specific assumptions regarding the infall / outflow rates .",
    "however , we note that analytical solutions are not able to give a complete description of the chemistry of a galaxy , since they fail in following the evolution of elements created on long time - scales , such as iron and nitrogen .",
    "a satisfactory description of the iron evolution requires detailed numerical models relaxing ira and including the chemical enrichment from type ia sne ( e.g. matteucci & greggio 1986 ) allow one to follow in detail the evolution of single elements .",
    "matteucci & greggio ( 1986 ) showed in detail the effect of the time - delay model , already suggested by tinsley ( 1980 ) and greggio & renzini ( 1983 ) , in particular the effect of a delayed fe production by type ia sne on abundance ratios involving @xmath0-elements ( o , mg , si ) .",
    "analytical solution can be , on the other hand , adopted when studying the evolution of oxygen , created on short timescales and tracing the evolution of the global metallicity , z , of which oxygen is the main component .    in this work we start by using the formalism described by matteucci ( 2001 ) , recchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and spitoni et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and we show , for the first time , the analytical solution of the evolution of the metallicity of a galaxy in presence of `` environment '' effects coupled with galactic fountains and primordial infall of gas . in this context for `` environment '' effect we mean the situation where a galaxy suffers , during its evolution , infall of enriched gas from another evolving galactic system , and this gas represents an enriched infall variable in time .",
    "the dynamics of interacting systems have been the subject of many papers concerning numerical simulations ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; barnes & hernquist 1992 ; berentzen et al .",
    "2003 ) and spectrophotometric models ( larson & tinsley 1978 ; kennicutt 1990 ; temporin et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b ) .",
    "large amounts of ism can be removed from the main disks of spiral galaxies by different processes : tides due to the gravitational force of a companion , ram pressure stripping during a near head - on collision between gas - rich galaxies , ram pressure stripping by intracluster gas , and galactic winds driven by supernovae .",
    "smith & struck ( 2001 ) using co signatures observed 11 extragalactic tails and bridges in nine interacting galaxy systems .",
    "recently , smith et al .",
    "( 2010 ) using galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) ultraviolet telescope studied star formation morphology and stellar populations and in 42 nearby optically selected pre - merger interacting galaxy pairs .",
    "tails and bridges structures are often more prominent relative to the disks in uv images compared to optical maps .",
    "this effect is likely due to enhanced star formation in the tidal features compared to the disks rather than to reduced extinction .",
    "we also refer the reader to the review of boselli & gavazzi ( 2006 ) where a comprehensive description of the environment effects on late - type galaxies in nearby clusters is presented . among them",
    "we recall the tidal interactions among galaxy pairs which act on gas , dust and stars , as well as on dark matter and is depending on the gravitational bounding of the various components ; tidal interaction between galaxies and the cluster potential well , and finally the so - called `` galaxy harassment '' : the evolution of cluster galaxies is governed by the combined effect of multiple high speed galaxy - galaxy close ( @xmath1 50 kpc ) encounters with the interaction with the potential well of the cluster as a whole .    as stated by davies et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , galaxy - galaxy interactions are particularly important and striking when the speed of the interaction is well matched to the velocities of the stars and gas .",
    "therefore , small galaxy groups can potentially provide the environment for dramatic gravitational disturbances . beyond the local group , the closest example of this is the environment around m81 , the m81 group .",
    "in fact , in m81 group it is evident that various galaxies are connected by flows .",
    "extended filamentary structures external to the disc of m81 , are clearly seen in emission in all of the herschel bands .",
    "these complex interactions can not be described by the simple tools offered , for example , by recchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) or similar papers in literature , and with this paper we provide a new set of analytical solutions to take into account this kind of interactions in the framework of analytical chemical evolution models .",
    "moreover , an enriched infall of gas can be originated from the galaxy itself .",
    "in fact , in the galactic fountain models ( shapiro & field 1976 , houck & bregman 1990 ) , hot gas is ejected out of the galactic disk by supernova ( sn ) explosions , and part of this gas falls back in the form of condensed neutral clouds which move at intermediate and high radial velocities .",
    "for example , in the galactic fountain model the ejected gas from sn events falls back ballistically ( bregman 1980 ) .",
    "these models are able to explain the vertical motion of the cold and warm gas components observed in several spiral galaxies ( e.g. fraternali et al . 2004 ; boosma et al .",
    "2005 ) . following the analytical implementation of the galactic fountain presented by recchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we will consider such an effect in our new analytical solutions .    in the context of cosmological semi - analytical models of galaxy formation and evolution each galaxy",
    "is treated as one unresolved object , using integrated properties to describe the mass of stars , cold gas , hot gas and the black hole . since each component of the galaxy",
    "is represented by one number , the dynamics within the galaxy is not resolved , and one needs to assume with laws for star formation , cooling and feedback that are valid on average for the entire galaxy . in this context , our new analytical solutions shall be extremely useful , because they give simple recipes concerning the time evolution of the global metallicity of a galaxy in different situations including inflow and outflow .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we present the main assumptions of the `` analytical '' chemical evolution models , in sect .",
    "3 we describe our assumptions and the system of equation we need to solve , and in sect 4 new analytical solutions are presented . finally ,",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 5 . in appendix",
    "a we draw the complete expressions of some new analytical solutions we presented in this paper , and in appendix b a list of variables and parameters used throughout the paper is reported .",
    "the main assumptions of the simple model ( tinsley 1980 ) are :    1 .",
    "the imf is constant in time . 2 .   the gas is well mixed at any time ( _ instantaneous mixing approximation _ )",
    "stars @xmath2 1 m@xmath3 die instantaneously ; stars smaller than 1 m@xmath3 live forever ( _ instantaneous recycling approximation _ or ira ) .",
    "these simplifying assumptions allow us to calculate analytically the chemical evolution of the galaxies once we have defined the fundamental quantities , such as the returned fraction :    @xmath4    ( where @xmath5 is the imf and @xmath6 is the mass of the remnant ) and the yield per stellar generation :    @xmath7    ( where @xmath8 is the fraction of newly produced and ejected metals by a star of mass @xmath9 ) .",
    "recently , recchi & kroupa ( 2015 ) applied the integrated galactic initial mass function ( igimf ) to the simple model solution , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are not constant , but are functions of time , through the time dependence of the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the metallicity of the system .",
    "the well known solution of the so called `` closed - box '' where the system is one - zone and there are no inflows nor outflows with constant mass ( gas plus stars ) is :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the gas fraction @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "it is also assumed that the @xmath16 and the initial metallicity of the system is zero .",
    "analytical solutions of simple models of chemical evolution including infall or outflow are known since at least 30 years ( pagel & patchett 1975 , hartwick 1976 , clayton 1988 , twarog 1980 , edmunds 1990 ) . here , we follow the approach and the terminology of matteucci ( 2001 ) , where it was assumed for simplicity _ linear _ flows ( gas flows are proportional to the sfr ) .",
    "therefore , the outflow rate @xmath17 is defined as :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the sfr , and the infall rate @xmath20 is given by :    @xmath21    here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are two proportionality constants @xmath24 .",
    "the first assumption is justified by the fact that , the larger the sfr is , the more intense are the energetic events associated with it ( in particular supernova explosions and stellar winds ) and therefore the larger is the chance of having a large - scale outflow ( see e.g. silk 2003 ) .",
    "a proportionality between @xmath25 and @xmath26 has been discussed by recchi et al .",
    "they tested different prescriptions for the infall of gas showing that their results do not change substantially if a generic exponential infall is assumed .",
    "this demonstrates also that the major source of error in the solutions of the simple models is the ira assumption rather than the assumption of linear flows .    in lilly",
    "et al ( 2013 ) and pipino et al . ( 2014 ) , they considered the simple chemical evolution model in the cosmological context where the gas accreted is proportional to the dark matter growth .",
    "in particular , in pipino et al . ( 2014 ) the infall parameter @xmath27 is time dependent and is defined as the ratio between the accretion rate from cosmological simulations and the sfr . in this paper",
    "we do not investigate `` cosmological '' aspects but we study the effects of galaxy - galaxy interactions on the time evolution of galactic metallicity .",

    "a new analytical solution when a primordial infall is coupled with interactions with a nearby galaxy is presented .",
    "the effect of dilution of a primordial gas infall overwhelms the enriched infall from the chemical evolution of a companion galaxy even with a primordial infall parameter comparable to the one of enriched infall .",
    "we have also shown how different sfes for the companion galaxy does not affect the chemical evolution of galaxy1 in presence of primordial infall .",

    "<S> in the last years , more and more interest has been devoted to analytical solutions , including inflow and outflow , to study the metallicity enrichment in galaxies . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> , we assume a star formation rate which follows a linear schmidt law , and we present new analytical solutions for the evolution of the metallicity ( z ) in galaxies . in particular , we take into account environmental effects including primordial and enriched gas infall , outflow , different star formation efficiencies and galactic fountains . </S>",
    "<S> the enriched infall is included to take into account galaxy - galaxy interactions . </S>",
    "<S> our main results can be summarized as : i ) when a linear schmidt law of star formation is assumed , the resulting time evolution of the metallicity z is the same either for a closed - box model or for an outflow model . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) the mass - metallicity relation for galaxies which suffer a chemically enriched infall , originating from another evolved galaxy with no pre - enriched gas , is shifted down in parallel at lower z values , if compared the closed box model . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) when a galaxy suffers at the same time a primordial infall and a chemically enriched one , the primordial infall always dominates the chemical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> iv ) we present new solutions for the metallicity evolution in a galaxy which suffers galactic fountains and an enriched infall from another galaxy at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solutions presented here can be very important to study the metallicity ( oxygen ) , which is measured in high - redshift objects . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions can be very useful : a ) in the context of cosmological semi - analytical models for galaxy formation and evolution , and b ) for the study of compact groups of galaxies .    </S>",
