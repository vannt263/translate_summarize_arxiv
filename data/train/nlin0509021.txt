    "complex social networks associated to _ internet _ , like as e - mail lists , news services etc .",
    "do not have a structured architecture like a project in network communication engineering .",
    "they show some kind of synergia given by the great amount of users who form the mentioned community .",
    "this study faces some problems , some time neither cultural guidelines are taken into account and the results are generalized with quite different guidelines .",
    "this is why we have restricted our analysis to one language and to the technical communities as an experimental application of the theoretical tools in social networks .",
    "this work is organized in two sections : the first one is devoted to a brief introduction on social networks and the other is referred to the study of communities coming from e - mail and `` news services '' in spanish language .",
    "a social network is a set of relations ( links or edges ) among different elements ( nodes , vertices or actors ) .",
    "formally a network is a graph @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the set of vertices , @xmath2 is the set of edges and @xmath3 such @xmath4 .",
    "that means , @xmath5 to each edge a pair of vertices are assigned and they are known as ends of edge . recently for",
    "the the networks study binary matrices are used , therefore an isomorphism exists @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the set of square binary matrices of dimension _ nxn_. this matrix is called adjacency matrix ( am)@xcite .",
    "social scientists defined by convention that actors ( output , egos ) are placed in the rows , while the attributes or related actors ( input , alter ) in the columns .",
    "the am is symmetric since we are dealing with non directed graphs@xcite .",
    "there are _ multiple _ graphs in which more than one kind of edges are identified as : ( kinship , friendship ) ; ( theme , author ) ; etc",
    ". this would be quite useful for building social substructures although for building the required am is more complicated .",
    "usually we regard an associated am with some particular projection i.e. _ kinship_. otherwise graphs may be weighted , that means it is possible to assign a weight to each link .",
    "this gives us a non zero value associated to each am element .",
    "as can be seen the am has all sensitive information related with the social network in particular .",
    "it is worth to notice that the diagonal elements in the matrix are filled with zeros or are neglected in the algorithms since the self interaction has no sense .",
    "however , then have to be considered in their booleans products @xcite . on the other hand",
    "some other properties can be associated with the am .",
    "`` macroscopic '' properties among the actors as * path * : is a concatenation of vertices connected by edges so that no chosen edge is repeated @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the initial vertex and @xmath10 the final vertex .",
    "* geodesic * : is the path of minimal length among actors . if it is not exist , as in the case of the non connected graphs , the infinite value is taken like the length . the geodesic path is the optimal path between actors , because socially , are actors with strongest links .",
    "also there are `` microscopic '' properties as * clique*. this is a measurement of the transitive triades of the network .",
    "two definitions exist , an originating one of theory of graphs . which knows it like transitivity a graph : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the cardinality of the set and the other one was formulated by watts y strogatz , known as * clustering * associated with the actor @xmath13 is defined as : @xmath14 and then averaged over the actors @xmath15 this is the `` clustering''@xcite .",
    "as much in a case as in another one , the transitive triades are small groups that represent the balance or the natural state towards which tend the social relations . but in either case they are small groups .",
    "another `` microscopic '' property is the average degree of connection among the closest neighbors ( cn)@xcite defined as :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the conditional probability the a vertex of @xmath18 degree is connected with another one with @xmath19 degree . on the other hand",
    "when @xmath20 is an increasing function the network is called _ associative _ , and if is decreasing is called _ dissociative_. also we may characterize the network from rows histograms , known as * prestige of the actor * this is coincidently with the columns histogram known * popularity of the actor*. but at the moment another kind of statistics is used called the _ connectivity _ probability , @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath21 is the probability that a randomly chosen vertex have @xmath18 edges @xcite .    according with the functional shape of the histogram s tail ( @xmath22 ) the network can be classified as * exponentials",
    "* , when @xmath23 ; * scale - free * , when @xmath24 with @xmath25 ; * broad - scale * , when is `` scale - free '' but with an abrupt cutoff ; and * single - scale * , when has a fast asymptotic decay @xcite . in mostly field experiments",
    "the * scale - free * network was shown as the dominant . in order to estimate the exponent the cumulative probability @xmath26 is used@xcite defined as :    @xmath27    if @xmath28 in the tail , then @xmath29 .",
    "all the non ponderated properties of the relation among actors are included in the am .",
    "each index row is associated with the actor who generates the subject , * author root * and each column index with the actors involved in the thread of conversation * author descendent*. a lexicographical arrangement is not used but by prestige@xcite , in other words , a low index is assigned to the actor with the greatest absolute frequency and successively until the index of greater value corresponding to the author of less prestige . for the construction of the matrix we have not taken into account the self - answers and no the threaded demands ( without thread ) . due to this fact",
    "they are discarded in previous phases to the application of the algorithm .      according with the standard rfc 822 and derivate rfc 2822 and 1036@xcite the transmission format of the messages coming from electronic mail and news services",
    "should be composed by some headers fields and a body in plain text .",
    "from all the fields sent in a single message the following fields are required to construct threads of messages : :    from : : :    this field contains the identity and direction of the person who sends    the message subject : : :    this field indicates the nature of the message .",
    "message - id : : :    this field must be unique for each message the suggested format is    `` @xmath30local_part@domain@xmath31 '' . in - reply - to : : :    refers to a or the * menssaje - id * where is the message is answered , if    the message is new this field does not appear .    before the use of threading algorithm , the messages go through a filter which extract the field of interest and delete unwanted message . this filter is written in_perl_@xcite . since mostly of the codes for messages threading are not free domain it was necessary to write our own code in `` c '' language from an existing one gpl@xcite in `` java''language , modified for generating a list from the actors sequence related with a thread , having as the list root",
    "the actor whose give the beginning of the thread .",
    "this algorithm have prove its robustness in hundred thousand trials .",
    "a brief sketch of the algorithm is given .",
    "the algorithm is based on the handling of connected structures of data which are :    .... container {       message message ;       container parent ;       container child ;       container next ; } ; ....    the field `` message '' , may be * nil*. the structure `` message '' have the following fields :    .... mensaje {       char * subject ;       char * message_id ;       char * in - reply - to ;       char * from ; } ; ....    when the field `` in - reply - to '' , take the value * nil * is indicating the message father .",
    "an indexed table is associated where in index is `` message_id '' from the message parent .",
    "then a `` container '' root or parent is associated .",
    "after that using the threading algorithm a message data base descendent associated is built . a table ordered by absolute frequencies of appearance of the `` author '' of the message father",
    "is generated with decreasing order .",
    "finally a am is built from the previous results .",
    "for algorithm details see `` _ message threading of jamie zawinsky , technical report _ '' .",
    "we have taken as leading cases two mailing lists in spanish which represents the observations done in previous studies .",
    "one is a purely technical list called * lu * and another one with the same actors but with a more general thematic called * mix*. this work have as null hypothesis those obtained from the algorithm `` _ configuration model _ ''",
    "( cm)@xcite composed by 1200 vertices .",
    "this allow us to build random networks with a given probability density of edges by vertex , @xmath21 .",
    "we have used @xmath32 with @xmath33 , since for this value stands the behavior for @xmath34 for the null hypothesis and the real cases . as can be observed in fig-[fig:1 ] in both cases the asymptotic behavior of @xmath35 is agree with those proposed by the cm .",
    "this dissociated mixed behavior is quite different to those found in jazz communities@xcite or scientific collaborators network@xcite , due their behavior is purely mixed associative .",
    "the following is a comparative table between the calculated values of `` _ clique _ '' , * c * by using watts and strogatz s algorithm and the averaged geodesic * g * for each case .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to calculate these parameters for real cases , non connected graphs were taken into account , that means that is not dense the closure adjacency matrix obtained from the warshall algorithm .",
    "this can be observed in fig-[fig:2 ] .",
    "this show different values from the averaged geodesic due to the fact that some actors are not linked .",
    "therefore we adopted an _ ad hoc _ criterion .",
    "the parameters were calculated in the maximal dense subgraphs where are the more popular actors which is according with _ in situ _ observations .",
    "that is , the behavior of a mailing list is given by the more related actors and not by the isolated or casuals answerers .",
    "because of this the number of vertices is reduced in 60% which have no relevance due to the huge number of actors .",
    "the cumulative probability @xmath36 is the most significative evidence of the difference between the null hypothesis and the real cases . as can be seen in fig-[fig:3 ]",
    "the tail ( @xmath34 ) is quite different from the theoretical straight line for * cm * as in``_scale free _",
    "'' networks .",
    "the behavior is `` _ single - scale _ '' .    instead of",
    "perform a linear fitting we use a quadratic fitting @xmath37 . in fig-[fig:4 ] may be notice the goodness of the fitting in the tail as the intermediate range .",
    "this give us the possibility of discard the behavior @xmath32 of the tail and replace for another @xmath38 .",
    "where @xmath39 for * lu * and @xmath40 for * mix*.    in worth to notice the same actors are linked in different way if the themes are different , in this case is not the same the tail for the list * lu * than for the list * mix*. therefore the language itself it not the unique constraint in the network behavior although the social paradigm where the actors are involved .",
    "this also indicates that the cumulative probability would be considered as a qualification element of the social behavior in this kind of societies .",
    "in this work we concluded that the social relations among a set of identical actors is strongly linked with the social paradigm where they are involved . on the other hand , at least in the societies under analysis the tail behavior @xmath36 , allows to quantify their differences .",
    "we may speculate and think that the dissociative character of these societies may be attributed to the fact these are open societies instead of closed ones as  _ small - world_. that means that no all the actors are related themselves by answering the mails and some actors cause the extinction of a theme by avoiding any close link ."
