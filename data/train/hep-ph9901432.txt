    "the charged higgs bosons @xmath0 are a central prediction of the two higgs doublet model which is necessitated by supersymmetry . given the results of recent experimental analyses , the neutral higgs exclusion at lep2 @xcite and the constraint on the rare bottom quark decay @xmath8 @xcite , both of which favour the elusive heavy mass region for @xmath0 , at least in the , it is important to establish the parameter regions in which @xmath0 can be discovered at present and future colliders .",
    "it is believed @xcite that lep2 can not discover the charged higgs bosons in the mass regions indicated by the  ( ) and the current bound @xcite on neutral higgs bosons , viz the mass relation @xmath9 gev .",
    "the search for such a particle needs greater centre - of - mass energy , notably at lhc and , to a more limited extent , tevatron @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to establish the significance of the secondary @xmath0 decay channels , mainly at lhc .",
    "if @xmath0 are ` heavy ' , which is taken from here on to imply @xmath10 , they can not be produced in top decay and the main production mode for them at hadron colliders is ` @xmath3 fusion ' , viz : @xmath11 we have taken @xmath12 as a sea quark , as is appropriate at such high energy collisions , whereas @xmath13 is created via @xmath14 .",
    "of course the charge conjugate process @xmath15 must also be included , and this behaves in exactly the same way since there is no intrinsic @xmath12 component of the proton .",
    "the above production channel has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "recent analyses have focussed on the dominant decay mode @xmath16 and the reduction of the background associated with it .",
    "the utilisation of the less dominant decay modes was discussed in the past @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the decay mode @xmath17 , improving on previous analyses by adopting the latest numbers for  parameters and parton distribution functions as well as using kinematic selection techniques and the tau polarisation analysis @xcite .",
    "the result of our analysis indicates that the discovery region for @xmath0 is far greater than has previously been thought , covering the whole of the @xmath18 parameter space up to @xmath19 tev and higher , and down to at least @xmath6 .",
    "optimisation in the analysis procedure and parameters can potentially extend the lower limit in @xmath7 to 1.5 , below which is excluded by lep2 measurements so far in the .",
    "in order to minimise the parameter dependence of our calculations and to make them applicable to as wide a range of parameters as possible , we adopt @xmath20 and @xmath7 as the two higgs sector parameters . when considering the @xmath0 decays , let us furthermore assume that the neutral higgs mixing angle @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 which holds in  at tree level in the heavy mass limit of the charged higgs bosons , explicitly , @xmath23 . in this limit ,",
    "practically the only  decay modes are @xmath24 and @xmath1 , and we assume superpartners too heavy to be produced in @xmath0 decays .",
    "we restrict our discussions to the tree level , since our primary purpose is to establish the plausibility of signal detection , rather than to propose precision measurements .",
    "we adopt mrs 1998 leading order parton distributions @xcite , and calculate the strong coupling at one loop using the default mrs parameter values , neglecting virtual top contributions in both cases .",
    "we assume zero kinematic bottom quark mass to be consistent with the sea quark picture we are adopting , whereas we retain finite bottom quark pole mass @xmath25 for the yukawa coupling , which we take to be 4.25 gev .",
    "similarly , we take the tau kinematic mass to be zero and set the yukawa coupling mass to 1.78 gev .",
    "both kinematic and yukawa masses of the top quark are taken to be 175 gev .",
    "the top quark , @xmath0 and @xmath26 widths are calculated at tree level , although we adopt the narrow width approximation for the top quark and @xmath0 .",
    "we also note that the quark masses implicit in the parton distribution functions are independent parameters which are in general distinct from the kinematic and yukawa masses we choose to adopt .",

    "maskawa matrix element @xmath31 $ ] is taken to be 1 ( it is practically 1 . see @xcite ) .",
    "as for the lhc collider parameters @xcite , the centre - of - mass energy for @xmath32 collision is 14 tev .",
    "integrated luminosities of 10 fb@xmath33 and 100 fb@xmath33 per year are expected in the low luminosity and high luminosity options , respectively .",
    "the squared matrix elements are calculated by hand with the usual trace method , convoluted with the mrs parton distribution functions , and integrated using  @xcite .",
    "the results are tested against the literature @xcite where they are available , and tests of gauge independence were carried out by hand .    when computing decay level distributions , the top quark is assumed to be on the mass shell using the so - called ` narrow width approximation ' , in order to minimise the number of ` unphysical ' feynman graphs we must consider without violating gauge invariance .",
    "we similarly take the @xmath26 boson arising from top quark decay to be on shell .    for the signal events , we assume that the top quark decays independently of production , by neglecting the spin correlation effects which are anyhow small for our purposes , in order to maximise the parameter space that can be covered in our analysis .",
    "since we take top quark to be on the mass shell , this procedure is exact in the limit of identical left and right @xmath0 coupling , at @xmath34 .",
    "we also take @xmath0 to be on the mass shell since we do not consider the finite width effect to be important at this stage .    for the background we incorporate the exact decay distribution of the top quark , and the finite constant width of @xmath26 , both of which are potentially important when considering kinematic cuts to reduce the background .",
    "the calculation was tested using  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties associated with the above procedure are expected to be dominated by two sources .",
    "firstly , the  higher order corrections which are of the order @xmath35 . to be more precise , our procedure will need to be tested for jet and detector effects , which must be carried out using  simulations where the leading  corrections are resummed and factorised .",
    "secondly , as we discuss in the next chapter , the possibility of the other decay modes , such as the @xmath36 decay mode for relatively light @xmath0 at low @xmath7 .",
    "the tree level feynman diagrams for the signal process are shown in figure [ feyn ] .",

    "@xmath7 is the ratio of the two expectation values of the two higgs doublets , and we assume @xmath46 .",
    "we do not tag the spectator bottom quark .",
    "however , in order to reduce the background , for example , from top pair , @xmath47 and single @xmath26 production , and to have a grip on the irreducible background , we do make use of the ` spectator ' top quark , @xmath48 . in @xcite , the following ` stiff lepton ' procedure",
    "was proposed : the top quark moves nearly parallel to the original @xmath49 parton direction , and will be lost in the beam jets . however , if it decays leptonically , the electron or muon will be kicked out with @xmath50 of the order @xmath51 so that this can be used to trigger the signal events .",
    "potentially the bottom quark can also be tagged , especially when it decays leptonically .    in this study",
    "we consider both the leptonic and hadronic decays .",
    "although the leptonic mode is more inclusive , the hadronic branching fraction is larger ( @xmath52=2/3 $ ] ) , and the lack of the missing momentum from leptonic decay makes the handling of the kinematic distributions more transparent .    in the leptonic decay mode , we consider the inclusive sample of top - like events , wherein we assume the top quark identification to be carried out with a universal efficiency of @xmath53 , with @xmath54 = 2/9 $ ] .    in the hadronic decay mode , we require the inclusive multi - jet final state to have a reconstructed mass near the top mass . if bottom jet tagging can be utilised , this will aid the procedure by allowing the @xmath26 mass to be reconstructed also .",
    "we can not make a full simulation of the top quark identification efficiency , but as a first approximation we require all parton level decay products to be reasonably away from the beam directions , at pseudorapidities of less than 1.5 in order to reduce the  noise .",
    "we do not impose cuts on separation between top decay products .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , and we will assume , that the tagging of the top quark is very effective in reducing the background , eliminating all but the irreducible background : @xmath55 whose presence is the main obstacle to the observation of the signal ( [ gbth ] ) .",
    "let us assume the leptonic decay mode @xmath56 . in the limit of heavy @xmath0 , @xmath57 ,",
    "the branching ratio is easily seen to be given by : @xmath58\\approx\\frac{\\gamma[\\tau\\nu]}{\\gamma[bt]}= \\frac{m_\\tau^2\\tan^2\\beta}{\\nc(m_t^2\\cot^2\\beta+m_b^2\\tan^2\\beta)}.\\ ] ] for finite @xmath20 the branching ratio is always greater than this limit , as there is kinematic suppression on top quark for the @xmath59 decay mode , which goes as @xmath60 .",

    "the @xmath63 decay rate is proportional to this .",
    "the ratio of this mode to the @xmath24 mode is given by : @xmath64}{\\gamma[bt]}=   \\frac{\\lambda^{3/2}[m_{h^\\pm},m_{w^\\pm},m_{h^0}]\\cos^2(\\beta-\\alpha ) }   { 2\\nc\\lambda[m_{h^\\pm},m_t,0](m_b^2\\tan^2\\beta+m_t^2\\cot^2\\beta)}\\ ] ] where @xmath65=(m_1 ^ 2-(m_2+m_3)^2)(m_1 ^ 2-(m_2-m_3)^2)$ ] and is symmetric under the permutations of the three masses .",

    "if @xmath71 , the @xmath72 decay could dominate in a small window , noting @xmath73 gev , just below the threshold for the @xmath3 mode .",
    "the factor @xmath74 cancels between ( [ mgbth ] ) and ( [ bratios ] ) , and we see that the cross section relevant to us goes as : @xmath75 in figure [ brplot](b ) we plot this quantity , which represents the overall @xmath7 dependence of production and decay in the @xmath1 mode .",

    "the complete matrix element squared for the background process ( [ gbtw ] ) , including the @xmath13 and @xmath26 decay , is available in @xcite .",
    "however , in order to gain insight into the structure of the background process let us present the spin- and colour- averaged matrix element squared for ( [ gbtw ] ) .",
    "the feynman graphs are identical to figure [ feyn ] with the substitution @xmath77 , in the following simple form ) by including the top quark and @xmath26 decay , with the top quark being on shell , as well as the @xmath26 from top quark decay . for the signal , ( [ mgbth ] )",
    "is supplemented similarly , but we set the @xmath0 on shell , and assume the top quark to decay independently of production by averaging over the top quark helicities , as mentioned in the previous chapter . neither of these approximations are expected to have a significant effect on our results . ] : @xmath78\\right ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this contains an ` isotropic ' part , the 2 inside the first square brackets , and a ` scalar ' part whose kinematics are exactly proportional to the signal cross section ( [ mgbth ] ) in the limit of degenerate @xmath0 and @xmath26 masses .",
    "the ratio of the two is around 1:1 ( see forthcoming table [ tablea ] ) . as for the @xmath26 branching ratio into @xmath79 ,",
    "this equals @xmath80 .",
    "thus in this limit , the ratio of signal to non - isotropic , ` scalar ' background , assuming @xmath0 branching ratio of equation ( [ bratios ] ) , is : @xmath81 @xmath82 , so this amounts to some excess of signal over background for large values of @xmath7 . in reality , this will be reduced further by the phase space suppression on @xmath0 production , but to compensate for this , the mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath26 can be exploited in kinematic cuts .",
    "a more subtle point is that @xmath0 are scalar whereas @xmath26 are vector , leading to different distributions of the decay products which may be utilised once a significant excess of signal over background is observed through the kinematic cuts . as a final stage of the signal  background analysis ,",
    "we can use tau polarisation as described in @xcite , noting that their helicities are predominantly left in @xmath26 decay , whereas they are predominantly right in @xmath0 decay .",
    "to summarise , our strategy is as follows .",
    "firstly , we select events with top quarks , possibly identified using the stiff lepton trigger , of the forms @xmath83 in the hadronic top quark decay mode , or @xmath84 in the leptonic decay mode , where @xmath85 is @xmath86 or @xmath87 ,  is the typically large missing transverse energy , and @xmath88 contains jets near the beam directions . secondly , we utilise kinematic cuts to screen out @xmath26 events . at this stage , it is desirable to be able to reconstruct the @xmath0 mass from the transverse momentum distribution of tau . in experimental analyses ,",
    "the kinematic selection cuts will be replaced by the fitting of the distributions with signal and background expectations , which is a more elegant and effective procedure .",
    "thirdly , we apply tau polarisation and spin correlation analyses in order to confirm the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "the total signal cross section , corresponding to ( [ gbth ] ) but excluding the @xmath7 dependence of equation ( [ brnorm ] ) , the kinematic suppression on @xmath24 mode of equation ( [ bratios ] ) , and excluding the @xmath89 initial state and the charge conjugate processes , is shown in figure [ figa ] .",
    "it can be seen that the cross section falls approximately exponentially with increasing @xmath20 , but even for large masses the cross section is significant , bearing in mind the integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath33 per year in the high luminosity option at lhc .    in table",
    "[ tablea ] we present the typical signal and background cross sections including the @xmath7 dependence , the kinematic suppression on @xmath3 mode , factor 4 for the @xmath89 initial state and charge conjugation , and the @xmath90 branching ratio of 1/9 .",
    "it is clear that the signal suffers from large background , against which we must find powerful cuts or distributions in order to make the signal visible .    in order to proceed further",
    ", we need to examine the distributions of decay products . in figures",
    "[ figb ] and [ figc ] we present the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions . since all particles in our final state are treated as being massless , the rapidity can be replaced by pseudorapidity .",
    "we have plotted the leptonic top decay modes only . for the hadronic top decay , discarding the small effects of spin correlation , the light quark jet distributions are as the lepton distributions , and the missing momentum distribution is identical to the tau transverse momentum distribution .",
    "we have also computed the rapidity difference between tau and the lepton , and found that the distribution does not behave significantly differently from the rapidity distribution of the lepton alone .    at first sight there",
    "seems little hope for signal detection .",
    "the rapidity distributions are similar , the small difference being partly due to spin correlation and partly due to the different resonance mass .",
    "the spin correlation can not be used to reduce the background since we have made the assumption that the top quark decays independently of production when generating the signal plots .",
    "anyhow , there will be a small spin correlation effect in kinematic distributions involving the top quark decay , which can be used to confirm the coupling structure of signal and background events if we acquire a sufficient sample .",
    "the tail of transverse momentum distribution for the background does not fall sufficiently to allow us to extract a convincing signal , especially if @xmath7 is not high enough .",
    "this is as remarked in @xcite .    on a closer examination of the the tail of tau transverse momenta for the background events , we note that this is not primarily due to off - shell @xmath26 production , but due to @xmath26 being produced back - to - back with the top quark at large transverse momenta .",
    "indeed , the author has made a similar plot using the ` narrow width approximation ' for the @xmath26 and the difference between this and figure [ figc]c is small . at a more analytical level too , it is easy to see that the off - shell effect is smaller than the kinematic effect of back - to - back production .",
    "as noted earlier , there is an ` isotropic ' component in the background production cross section ( [ mgbtw ] ) which makes the background even more prone to this back - to - back production than the signal .",
    "having said that , we see that at large transverse momenta , the signal distributions of figures [ figc]a , b also exhibit ` dips ' in missing transverse momenta at high energies corresponding to the back - to - back production .",
    "such events are simpler to deal with than the ` down - the - beam - pipe ' type events , since in this case the hadronic top quark decay can be used to reconstruct the top quark mass , giving us more control over the signal distributions .",
    "let us proceed as follows .",
    "firstly , we remove events where tau and missing transverse momenta are not back - to - back , viz @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "secondly , out of the events which survive the above requirement , we remove events where , in the leptonic case , a top quark remnant , either the bottom quark or the lepton , is harder than either the tau or the missing transverse momentum . in the hadronic case",
    ", we can proceed similarly , imposing some requirement on the reconstructed top quark ( or a remnant ) transverse momentum against either the tau or the missing transverse momentum . as default ,",
    "we adopt @xmath93 as the momentum cut - off .",
    "thirdly , we make cuts on the tau and the missing transverse momenta , either by an explicit cut or by a plot of the cross section against @xmath94 .    as for the detector cuts , for the leptonic decay mode of the top quark ,",
    "the only requirement is on the tau and the missing transverse momenta .",
    "this will also help eliminate the reducible background , for example , from top pair production .",
    "we tentatively set this at 50 gev .",
    "the final transverse momentum cut mentioned above will alter this minimum value at a later stage in the analysis .",
    "we also require the tau rapidity to be between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , although this may be redundant after the transverse momentum cuts .",
    "for the hadronic decay mode of the top quark we require all top decay products to have rapidity between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , in addition to the transverse momentum requirement above .",
    "to summarise , the cuts are : @xmath99 for the leptonic decay of the top quark , and @xmath100 for the hadronic decay of the top quark .",
    "the resulting @xmath101 and  distributions are used to determine the optimum transverse momentum cut procedure .",
    "the result is shown in tables [ tableb ] and [ tablec ] .",
    "the cuts are not optimised , and it is possible that the signal against background ratio can be improved without reducing the absolute rate too much .",
    "in any case , it is likely that the hadronic decay of the top quark offers a far greater chance of signal resolution , even though there is a significant loss of top remnants near the beam pipe .",
    "the improved background reduction is because of the absence of the neutrino from the decay of the top quark , allowing us to know the transverse momentum of the tau neutrino .",
    "let us concentrate on the hadronic decay from here on .    in figure [ figd ]",
    "we show the tau transverse momentum distribution for the background events , after cuts , before the final transverse momentum cut .",
    "the missing transverse momentum , which we do not plot here , should have the same profile neglecting the spin correlation effects , but in practice the large integration error prevents this coincidence to materialise in our simulation .",
    "comparing figures [ figc ] and [ figd ] we see that rather than to keep @xmath94 as a free parameter as one would do in an experimental analysis , an easy way to simulate the effect of transverse momenta cuts is to impose cuts at 100 gev on both tau and missing transverse momenta .",
    "the numerical integration for the background becomes very unstable at this value and renders higher cuts impractical in our simulation .",
    "the optimisation of cuts can be achieved by balancing between keeping the production of the bosons @xmath0 and @xmath26 at low transverse momenta via the cuts described above for example , and the final cuts on , or the distribution of , the tau and missing transverse momenta . as we lower the transverse momenta of the bosons we also lower the transverse momentum of the top quark . since we can not present a full simulation of top quark identification near the beam directions we do not consider it worthwhile speculating further into this , until we can utilise the full simulation .",
    "table [ tabled ] shows the result after the final cuts .",
    "the cut is very effective at large @xmath20 , where it is clear that larger values of @xmath94 would allow lower values of @xmath7 to be probed .",
    "this can be easily achieved in practice by plotting the cross section after cuts against @xmath94 .",
    "the signal will show a ` bump ' in the distribution , which can be confirmed as due to @xmath0 rather than statistical fluctuation by tau polarisation and spin correlation analyses .    for the intermediate values of @xmath7 we can extrapolate the figures by the known dependence of the cross section on @xmath7 . at @xmath102 gev , where the transverse momentum cut is least effective",
    ", the signal - to - background ratio becomes 1:1 at @xmath103 .",
    "given the lhc integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath33 for the high luminosity option , this corresponds to observing 3 events per year .    for large values of @xmath20 ,",
    "say masses higher than 500 gev , the transverse momentum cut becomes very effective at reducing the background , but we must deal with the exponentially falling cross section ( see figure [ figa ] ) . as an example , at @xmath104 tev , applying the same cuts as above but setting @xmath105 gev , we obtain a cross section of 0.00168 fb at @xmath106 .",
    "the numerical integration for the background is very unstable , but we consider it negligible .",
    "we find that in order to observe one event per year at the integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath33 , @xmath7 must be greater than 3.7 .",
    "we note that at such high values of @xmath20 , the @xmath3 decay mode becomes relatively clean , as what we observe will be @xmath12 and @xmath13 jets back - to - back with transverse momenta of about 500 gev each . in the @xmath79 decay mode too , the signal will be spectacular , with the hard tau and the missing momentum pointed back to back .",
    "presumably the requirement of top identification becomes less important here , and the minimum @xmath7 can be lowered significantly . as a conservative estimate , @xmath107 is accessible in the @xmath79 decay mode of @xmath0 for @xmath20 between 200 gev and 1 tev .    for smaller values of @xmath20 ,",
    "the transverse momentum cut becomes less effective , we must impose stricter preliminary cuts , and the analysis becomes complex . on the other hand ,",
    "this range involves kinematic suppression on the @xmath24 decay mode of @xmath0 , and the branching ratio into @xmath79 becomes greater .",
    "as an added bonus , the @xmath72 mode kicks in at low @xmath7 where the @xmath79 channel becomes the least effective , which is easy to handle by imposing @xmath12 vertex tagging on @xmath108 since we will hopefully know the @xmath109 mass at an early stage in lhc operation .",
    "we have discussed the search for the charged higgs bosons @xmath0 of the two higgs doublet model , inherent for example in , through the @xmath79 decay mode at lhc through the ` @xmath24 fusion ' production channel .",
    "provided we neglect the other decay modes which are model dependent , the cross section is roughly proportional to @xmath111 , which implies that if we improve the procedure merely by fourfold , which is not unrealistic , the minimum @xmath7 that can be probed falls to 1.5 , which is below the maximum @xmath7 probed so far at lep2 assuming .",
    "the plots of the tau and the missing transverse momenta indicate that the @xmath0 mass can be evaluated to some degree from the signal distribution provided there is large enough sample . at least before cuts , the @xmath50 distributions of the tau and the missing transverse momenta are independent of @xmath7 , allowing one to reconstruct @xmath20 .",
    "the total cross section , being proportional to @xmath111 , is then a good measure of @xmath7 .",
    "the spin correlations involving the top quark decay products can be used to confirm this measurement .",
    "we only considered the irreducible background to this process .",
    "the reducible background includes top pair production and @xmath113jets production .",
    "the second one is presumably removable by imposing the top selection and as long as we impose some jet profile criterion in the selection ( so as to filter out soft multi - jets ) , it is at higher order in  anyhow .",
    "the top pair background is only significant if one of the bottom quarks from top decay escapes in the beampipe .",
    "although the cross section for this may not be negligible , this is hardly likely to lead to large tau and missing transverse momenta , as is the @xmath114jets background , and should be negligible in our analysis .",
    "we did not consider the supersymmetric background , notably the @xmath115 sbottom  neutralino production from @xmath116 fusion , with the sbottom decaying into top quark , @xmath26 and neutralino . in some regions of the parameter space where the sbottom decays into a top quark and a chargino and",
    "the chargino decays into a @xmath26 and a neutralino , such background will be large .    once @xmath0 has been discovered in this channel",
    ", the mass and the @xmath7 thus obtained can be used to optimise the signal extraction procedure for other modes , notably the dominant @xmath24 decay , leading to a better understanding of the two - doublet higgs sector .",
    "our analysis is sensitive to top quark identification near the beam direction , especially in the hadronic channel .",
    "this needs to be studied with full jet and detector simulations , leading to the optimisation of the signal extraction procedure , before the exact discovery contour can be elucidated .",
    "we note that as long as top quark is identified as such , we do not require much more information , other than the guarantee that there is no other source of missing transverse momentum , for our analysis .",
    "in fact , this guarantee may be sufficient on its own when using our procedure of selecting high transverse momentum decay products from charged bosons produced at low transverse momentum .",
    "the effect on reducible background of relaxing the top quark identification requirement may thus be worth analysing ."
