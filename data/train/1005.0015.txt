    "conversely , any orientation and labelling of the edges of @xmath43 determines a combinatorial map @xmath44 that sends vertices to vertices and edges to edges .",
    "we will only consider such maps , and we will usually think of them in terms of the corresponding labelled and oriented graph @xmath43 .    covering maps to @xmath38 are easily characterised in terms of the labelling and orientation on @xmath43 .",

    "it will follow from theorem [ t : jordan s theorem ] that the action of @xmath0 on the vertices of @xmath43 is either alternating or symmetric . in order to force the action",

    "as before , we see that the action of @xmath0 on the vertex set of @xmath43 is symmetric or alternating , but the modification ensures that each generator @xmath46 acts as an even permutation .",
