    "extensive polarization studies of nearby galaxies revealed the existence of spiral magnetic field configurations with a radial field component comparable in strength to the azimuthal one ( beck et al .",
    "1996 ) . since strong shearing motions caused by rapid differential rotation will transform any radial structures into azimuthal ones within a few galactic rotations , an effective process continuously regenerating radial magnetic fields is required .",
    "the above findings boosted the development of turbulent dynamo theories . according to these , in strongly differentially rotating disks",
    "the large - scale radial magnetic field @xmath2 is generated from the azimuthal field @xmath3 according to the equation ( in cylindrical galactic coordinates @xmath4 , ruzmaikin et al .",
    "1988 ) :    @xmath5    while the rotational shear converts @xmath2 back into the azimuthal field :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 constitutes the measure of mean helicity of a small - scale turbulent velocity field @xmath8 ( also called the @xmath1-effect ) , @xmath9 is the local angular rotation speed of the galactic disk and @xmath10 is the turbulent diffusion coefficient .",
    "the persistence of the radial magnetic field against differential rotation constitutes a typical signature of the dynamo action described by eq .",
    "a vertical magnetic field component is generated as well , however , in realistic dynamo models it becomes significant at @xmath11  kpc ( e.g. urbanik et al .",
    "this is higher than the typical scale height of synchrotron emission of @xmath12  kpc ( hummel et al .",
    "1991 ) , thus vertical fields are usually not seen in emission .",
    "almost all nearby spiral galaxies known to possess spiral magnetic patterns ( beck et al .",
    "1996 ) show strong density waves associated with radial gas streaming motions and compression effects . in such objects",
    "density wave flows can be at least partly responsible for a strong radial field component and high magnetic pitch angles . in some concepts",
    "the non - azimuthal flows in spiral arms may even be a crucial agent for the maintenance of radial magnetic fields ( e.g. otmianowska - mazur et al .",
    "thus , the observed radial field component may result from a complex interplay of density - wave flows and the @xmath1-effect ( see moss  1998 ) , difficult to disentangle .",

    "[ arms ] ) of ngc  3521 and ngc  5055 we are able to trace weak signs of spiral structure . though both galaxies exhibit similar traces of a spiral pattern in the near - infrared ( thornley 1996 ) , ngc  3521 shows only weak signs of spiral structure in its h@xmath1 emission . the inner disk is filled uniformly with chaotically distributed hii regions , the ne arm seen by thornley ( 1996 ) is composed of two mutually crossing segments having different pitch angles ( fig .",
    "[ arms ] ) .",
    "aligned h@xmath1 structures are found only close to the inner part of one segment ne and east of the centre .",
    "no aligned h@xmath1 structures accompany the dust lanes and total power ridge on the western and sw disk side .",
    "generally ngc  5055 seems to show a better degree of alignment of h@xmath1 and optical features , in agreement with weak but still detectable density - wave signs described by thornley & mundy ( 1997 ) and by kuno et al .",
    "the weak infrared arms discussed by thornley & mundy ( 1997 ) correspond to two aligned chains of hii regions seen in our h@xmath1 map . using both the h@xmath1 and optical images we traced them out to a further distance than thornley & mundy ( 1997 ) . in the enhanced optical image we identified also several spiral - like dust lanes ( fig .",
    "[ arms ] ) .    to check for possible associations between the magnetic field orientations and those of star - forming filaments and dust lanes we again used the beam - smoothed models of polarized emission obtained by integrating the u and q stokes parameters due to an assumed magnetic field structure .",
    "the regular fields were assumed to be locally parallel to rudimentary spiral - like features shown in fig .  [ arms ] and distributed in a way yielding the observed distribution of polarized intensity .    in ngc  3521",
    "the mean modeled pitch angle is in both lobes smaller by about @xmath28 errors than the observed one ( fig .",
    "[ lgar ] ) .",
    "the observed values of @xmath29 higher than the modeled ones occur in almost all individual map points which have the observed polarized intensity above the noise level , the differences reach locally @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . in the southern and sw disk of ngc  5055 ( azimuths @xmath30  @xmath32 )",
    "no systematic difference between mean modeled and observed magnetic pitch angles has been found . however , in the ne disk ( the azimuthal angle range",
    "@xmath33  @xmath34 ) the model yields small pitch angles in agreement with a preponderance of nearly azimuthal optical structures , while the observed mean value of @xmath29 is much higher , similar to that in the sw lobe ( fig .",
    "[ lgar ] ) , as expected for an axisymmetric turbulent dynamo .",
    "we also stress that ngc  3521 while possessing much weaker signs of organized spiral structure does not show smaller mean pitch angles of polarization b - vectors than ngc  5055 , as one could expect if the radial magnetic field were primarily due to local radial flows and/or compressions in arm - like spiral structures . in the face of the above , the radial magnetic fields and large pitch angles are unlikely to be caused by gas flows and compressions in spiral features and need to be explained by a turbulent dynamo process .",
    "though the dynamo action generates primarily radial fields , too high magnetic pitch angles can make a problem for the classical dynamo concept .",
    "the analysis of mathematical properties of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) by ruzmaikin et al .",
    "( 1988 ) implies that for differentially rotating galaxies ( to which both discussed objects belong , burbidge et al .",
    "1960 , 1964 ) :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the typical values of @xmath1 and @xmath9 in the disk , while @xmath38 is the scale height of ionized gas .",
    "these authors define the dynamo number @xmath39 measuring the dynamo efficiency as @xmath40 . as the ratio @xmath41 defines the magnetic pitch angle @xmath29 eq .",
    "( 3 ) implies that :    @xmath42    thus , the stronger the dynamo action the smaller is the magnetic pitch angle .",
    "this is largely due to the fact that the kinetic helicity @xmath1 driving the dynamo depends primarily on the turbulence vorticity @xmath43 which is driven by coriolis forces proportional to the angular disk speed @xmath9 , hence @xmath43 and @xmath1 are proportional to @xmath9 , as well .",
    "a strong dynamo action requires a high degree of turbulence helicity , and thus rapid rotation . as normal galaxies mostly rotate differentially",
    ", this in turn leads to a faster conversion of the radial field component into the azimuthal one ( eq . ( 2 ) ) thereby decreasing the magnetic pitch angle . by all the above _ large magnetic pitch angles _",
    "need a _ weak dynamo action _ with a slow rotation and/or a small @xmath1 yielding together a small absolute value of the dynamo number @xmath44 ( eq . ( 4 ) ) .",
    "the dynamo number @xmath39 can not be arbitrarily decreased to produce large magnetic pitch angles .",
    "solutions of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are sought in the form @xmath45 .",
    "the magnetic field generation requires its growth with time and hence a positive value of the growth rate @xmath46 .",
    "this parameter is an increasing function of the absolute value of dynamo number @xmath39 ( ruzmaikin et al .",
    "1988 ) . for @xmath44 smaller than some critical value",
    "@xmath47 @xmath46 is negative and the magnetic field decays .",
    "an efficient field amplification needs @xmath48 .",
    "the latter quantity depends on many detailed assumptions concerning e.g. the distribution of @xmath1 with the height above the disk etc .",
    "but for realistic galaxy models @xmath47 can not be lower than @xmath496  10 .",
    "for this reason classical dynamo models have problems with generating spiral - like magnetic fields with pitch angles in excess of @xmath50  @xmath51 .",
    "the above formalism applied to mean magnetic pitch angles of observed galaxies implies the mean dynamo numbers @xmath52 in ngc  3521 and @xmath53 in ngc  5055 , considerably below the required 6  10 for normal spiral galaxies ( ruzmaikin et al .",
    "taking into account all uncertainties and approximations , the classical dynamo process in the studied galaxies would at best work at its critical threshold . with @xmath46 of about zero or just above it",
    "the production of galaxy - scale magnetic fields would be extremely slow and inefficient , if possible at all .    more recent , refined numerical dynamo models , involving a feedback of magnetic fields upon turbulent motions ( e.g. elstner et al .",
    "1996 ) encounter a similar pitch angle problem .",
    "the above authors found that , in the case of an axisymmetric dynamo , large pitch angles require large turbulence correlation times ( see elstner et al .",
    "1996 for detailed definitions ) , which in turn gives rise to oscillatory , dipole solutions , very unlikely to exist in real galactic disks .",
    "rohde & elstner ( 1998 ) attained a steady dynamo solution with pitch angles reaching @xmath54 in case of turbulence modulation by star formation enhancement in spiral arms .",
    "however , the applicability of this model to flocculent galaxies having little concentration of star - forming processes in spiral arms ( as shown by our h@xmath1 images ) is highly disputable .",
    "the very recent , non - standard models of dynamo driven by magnetic buoyancy ( moss et al . 1999 ) are more promising .",
    "the quoted authors obtained typical magnetic pitch angles of order @xmath30 , they also obtained reasonable solutions with @xmath2 comparable to @xmath3 .",
    "our observations of quite large pitch angles of b - vectors apparently support these new dynamo concepts .",
    "another problem with applying the dynamo concept to flocculent galaxies is the magnetic pitch angle asymmetry in ngc  3521 . in normal galaxies",
    "the dynamo process generates an axisymmetric magnetic field with a similar mean pitch angle in both polarized lobes ( fig .",
    "[ modpi ] ) as indeed observed in ngc  5055 . in contrast , in ngc  3521 both polarized lobes differ in the magnetic pitch angle @xmath29 by more than @xmath28 r.m.s .",
    "error , which can not be explained by the axisymmetric dynamo .",
    "we note however , that smaller values of @xmath29 in the sw disk are associated with smaller optical pitch angles and that this region also contains a total power ridge not caused by local star - forming processes ( sect .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the red optical image by dettmar & skiff ( 1993 ) suggests that this region might recently have been perturbed by a `` soft merging '' event or compressions by the intergalactic gas in which case the total power ridge might result from the magnetic field squeezing .",
    "as the pitch angle decrease on the compressed side has been observed in wind - swept galaxies ngc  4254 ( soida et al .",
    "1996 ) and ngc  2276 ( hummel & beck 1995 ) , the same sort of interactions may explain the pitch angle asymmetry in ngc  3521 .",
    "in order to check whether galaxies lacking organized optical spiral patterns still possess spiral magnetic fields , we mapped two flocculent galaxies showing only weak signs of global spiral structures in total power and polarization at 10.55  ghz . a single - dish instrument , the 100 m effelsberg telescope , was used to obtain maximum sensitivity to weak extended emission .",
    "the most important results are as follows :    * both galaxies have a mean degree of magnetic field regularity not significantly lower than that of a small sample of grand - design spirals with similar star - forming properties .",
    "some differences in the polarized emission from the central regions of observed flocculent spirals may be explained by differences of the star formation distribution in their inner disks * despite a lack of obvious density wave action both flocculent objects show spiral - like regular magnetic fields with a significant radial component as expected for the dynamo action .",
    "the mean magnetic pitch angles in both galaxies are similar and amount to some 25@xmath24  30@xmath24 , being somewhat larger in ngc  3521 .",
    "beam - smoothed polarization models were applied to prove that such large pitch angles can not constitute an artifact of limited resolution and projection effects * the magnetic pitch angles are only loosely connected to those of rudimentary optical structures and are likely caused by turbulent dynamo action . however ,",
    "such large pitch angles pose some problems to classical dynamo theory , preferring newly developed non - standard dynamo concepts    in this work we demonstrate for the first time that flocculent galaxies are able to develop regular spiral magnetic fields similar in strength and structure to those in grand - design spirals , thus _ large - scale density - wave flows are not needed to produce global spiral magnetic fields with a substantial radial component_. we believe that this provides arguments in support of the existence of turbulent dynamo action , free from effects of density wave flows , making it difficult to single - out pure dynamo - type magnetic fields in nearby spirals . to make the dynamo possible",
    "an efficient turbulent diffusion of the magnetic field is required rather than the often assumed nearly perfect flux freezing .",
    "however , details of the magnetic field properties may depend on the distribution of star - forming processes .",
    "we think that our present results make flocculent galaxies worth observing at higher resolution , to clarify the details of the magnetic field properties .",

    "<S> according to the classical axisymmetric dynamo concept , differentially rotating galaxies which lack organized optical spiral patterns and density wave flows should still have spiral magnetic fields with a substantial radial component . to check this hypothesis we observed two flocculent spirals , ngc  3521 and ngc  5055 , in the radio continuum ( total power and polarization ) at 10.55  ghz with a resolution of @xmath0 . </S>",
