    "recently , superconducting quantum circuits ( sqcs ) based on superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) @xcite , have appeared to be among the most promising candidates for quantum information processing .",
    "especially , schemes of quantum information transfer ( qit ) and quantum entanglement by using sqc in a microwave cavity are carried out in many experiments @xcite . the essential idea beyond these schemes",
    "is listed as follows .",
    "firstly , one should make several squids @xcite coupling to a single mode quantum field in a microwave cavity .",
    "secondly , qit in the quantum computing can be realized by adjusting the external field to carry out a sequence of quantum logic operations on squids .    in this aspect",
    ", there are many experiments by using squids yang , steinbach to realize quantum entanglement of macroscopic quantum devices . here , a theoretical protocol has been proposed based on the experimentally accessible parameters @xcite , in which two squids are placed into a microwave cavity .",
    "each flux qubit has a @xmath0-type energy level configuration .",
    "an external classical field is applied to this system .",
    "because these two three - level artificial atoms ( or squids ) couple to a single - mode quantum field simultaneously , an effective coupling between two three - level systems are induced by this single mode field .",
    "this field behaves as a data bus to link two qubits coherently .",
    "when two three - level systems coupling to two fields , a classical field and a quantized cavity mode , there is usually a dark state , which contains a component with maximal entanglement of two qubits . to realize the maximal quantum entanglement  between two qubits via the dark state , an auxiliary squid is used to carry out a projective quantum measurement . as a result of post selection measurement by wave function collapse",
    ", a quantum state with maximal entanglement can be obtained .",
    "although this scheme is very subtle in the theoretical setup , there are still some further considerations of physical mechanism needed .",
    "especially , the influence of the auxiliary squid should be taken into account since it should be treated as a quantum subsystem . according to the contemporary theory of quantum measurement , apparatus",
    "are usually considered as a quantum subsystem interacting with the measured system .",
    "in fact , the quantum effect of an auxiliary squid in kansas scheme @xcite is not considered in details . in this paper",
    ", we will stress the quantum effect of the auxiliary squid with respect to the whole quantum system .",
    "our result shows that the back action of the auxiliary squid on two qubits can not be ignored .",
    "this paper is based on the theoretical proposal of ref .",
    "we first briefly review the essential idea of this paper with the setup being illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . in each squid",
    "( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) the transition from the ground state @xmath3 to the excited state @xmath4 resonates with the same single - mode cavity field .",
    "the transition from the first excited state @xmath5 to the excited state @xmath6 resonates with a external classical field .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath7 yang , you , nori is written in the interaction picture as@xmath8where @xmath9 @xmath10 are coupling constants between the cavity field and two squids respectively , @xmath11 @xmath12 are coupling constants between the external field and the two squids respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are creation and annihilation operators of the cavity field mode . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath15 is time dependent to investigate the dynamics of a quantum information transfer between two squids . in this paper",
    "we only concern the quantum entanglement of squids and the effect of the auxiliary squid .",
    "so @xmath15  is a constant throught this paper .    for the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the total excitation number @xmath16is conserved , i.e. , @xmath17=0 $ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalized in each invariant subspace . in this paper , we focus on @xmath18  subspace , which is spanned by the following basis@xmath19where @xmath20  and @xmath21  denote cavity mode states with @xmath22 and @xmath23 photon number respectively . diagonalizing the matrix of @xmath7 in this subspace we obtain the eigenstate@xmath24with vanishing eigenvalue . here ,",
    "@xmath25^{-1/2}$ ] is the normalized factor .",
    "this is the so - called dark state because it does not couple to excited states @xmath6 .",
    "when a photon is detected , this state is collapsed to state @xmath26 , which is the maximally entangled state in the case @xmath27 .",
    "this is the main mechanism for the generation of entanglement . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an auxiliary squid is employed to probe the state of the cavity . in this scheme the state of cavity field",
    "is measured by observing the state of the auxiliary squid .",
    "this task can be accomplished in the following process . a two - level auxiliary squid ( see fig .",
    "2 ) can be prepared initially in the ground state @xmath28 .",
    "it is obvious that , if the cavity field is initially in a single photon state @xmath20 the auxiliary squid will evolve into the excited state @xmath29 after a half period of rabi oscillation ; if the cavity field is in the photon state @xmath21 the auxiliary squid always keeps in the ground state @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , after a half period of rabi oscillation , one can measure the auxiliary squid to detect the cavity indirectly .",
    "if the auxiliary squid collapses to the ground state @xmath30 , the cavity field collapses to the corresponding state @xmath21 .",
    "then an entangled state of two squids@xmath31 \\text { , } \\label{entangled}\\]]is created with @xmath32^{-1/2}$ ] being the normalized factor .",
    "._,width=7 ]    this the central idea of kansas scheme , from which we can see that a post - selection measurement plays a key role in creating the flux qubit entanglement .",
    "the post - selection measurement is performed by an auxiliary squid . in the following ,",
    "we consider the auxiliary squid as a part of whole quantum system .",
    "in this section the auxiliary squid will be taken into account as a quantum subsystem . and",
    "the dynamical evolution of the measured system ( two squids ) will be considered .",
    "together with the auxiliary squid , the whole system contains two parts , the auxiliary squid as the apparatus and the two squids as the measured system .",
    "therefore , in the interaction picture , the hamiltonian of the whole system reads as@xmath33@xmath34 describes the interaction between the auxiliary squid and the cavity field with the coupling constant @xmath35 . for simplicity ,",

    "when the auxiliary squid is employed to measure the state of the cavity field , @xmath35 is switched on ,  state @xmath39 will evolve driven by the hamiltonian ( [ whole h ] ) .",
