    "the recent measurement  @xcite of the refractive index of helium in a microwave cavity resonator has yielded the hitherto most precise experimental value of the molar polarizability of the helium atom , @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is avogadro s number , @xmath2 is the vacuum permittivity ( also called the `` electric constant '' ) , and @xmath3 is the static electric dipole polarizability of helium .",
    "we also recall that @xmath4 is defined in the limit of zero density .",
    "the techniques in this experiment could lead to measurements of thermodynamic temperature or to a determination of the value of the boltzmann constant .",
    "each of these applications would take advantage of the fact that @xmath3 has been accurately determined theoretically in a series of calculations including complete leading relativistic @xmath5 and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xmath6 corrections in the fine structure constant expansion @xcite with an uncertainty of 0.2  ppm from the estimate of the @xmath7 term . here",
    ", the magnitude of the corrections is given in atomic units , i.e. , relative to the hartree energy scale .",
    "we note that for excitation by low - energy radiation , as is relevant for the experiment  @xcite , the relativistic and radiative corrections to the polarizability are unambiguously defined .",
    "however , for higher frequencies , there may be additional field - configuration dependent corrections ( see appendix e of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "black - body radiation present in the cavity resonator will lead to a temperature - dependent correction to the measured value of the helium molar polarizability , which could affect the interpretation of such measurements .",
    "however , the correction due to black - body radiation was assumed to be negligible compared to the uncertainty of the measurement in ref .",
    "( heuristic arguments that support this assumption and indicate that it is also valid for argon are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] below . )",
    "the experiment  @xcite determined the polarizability of helium atoms through the interaction of microwaves with the atoms in a cavity resonator . at the same time , black - body radiation is present in the resonator , and it also interacts with the atoms . as a first approximation ,",
    "the interaction of the cavity microwaves with the atoms and the interaction of the black - body radiation with the atoms are independent processes and do not affect each other .",
    "the dominant energy shifts due to microwave radiation on the one hand , and due to black - body radiation on the other hand , are described by the corresponding second - order ac stark shifts  @xcite and are proportional , to very good approximation , to the dynamic second - order dipole polarizability at the microwave and black - body frequencies .",
    "the derivation of the theoretical second - order expressions in both classical , time - ordered perturbation theory and in the field - quantized framework are contrasted against each other in ref .",
    "@xcite . from a quantum electrodynamic ( qed )",
    "point of view , both photon annihilation as well as photon creation processes contribute to the dynamic polarizability .",
    "besides the second - order polarizability , there is also a fourth - order effect which is due to the exchange of four instead of two photons with the radiation field(s ) .",
    "when the radiation is monochromatic , the total fourth - order energy shift is proportional to the so - called hyperpolarizability of the atom  @xcite .",
    "however , when the atom is simultaneously interacting with both microwave as well as black - body radiation , the treatment has to be modified because photon creation and annihilation processes of one and the same field have to be `` matched , '' and this excludes some intermediate , virtual states of the atom@xmath8radiation field from the fourth - order expressions . indeed , in generalizing the fully quantized formalism to fourth order",
    ", we find convenient expressions which describe the two - color hyperpolarizability .",
    "the resulting fourth - order energy shift finds a natural interpretation as a perturbation of the second - order dynamic energy shift due to the microwave photons .",
    "the latter is proportional to the dynamic polarizability .",
    "therefore , the fourth - order effect constitutes a correction to the dynamic polarizability of the atom .",
    "note that some of the qed corrections to the polarizability of helium also involve fourth - order perturbation theory  @xcite , with black - body photon interactions being replaced by the interactions with the radiative photons .",
    "however , there is an important difference .",
    "e.g. , for the qed corrections to the bethe logarithm , the atom only emits then absorbs virtual radiative photons , while it emits then absorbs , and absorbs then emits photons with the probing electromagnetic waves . in the evaluation of the black - body radiation correction to the dynamic polarizability",

    "in order to formulate the problem , we need to take into account the interaction of the helium atom with two electromagnetic fields : ( i ) the microwave field used to probe the electric dipole polarizability , and ( ii ) the black - body radiation field .",
    "we work with a second quantized radiation field and with a first quantized theory for the atomic electrons .",
    "furthermore , we work in the schrdinger picture . in si units ,",
    "the hamiltonian for the helium atom coupled to an external source of microwaves and affected by black - body radiation is given as @xmath9 here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are multi - indices defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the wave vectors of the probing microwave field and of the black - body field , and @xmath15 denote their polarizations .",

    "we describe the interaction of the atom with the quantized electromagnetic fields in the length gauge .",
    "the electric dipole interactions of the atom with the microwave and black - body fields are as follows , @xmath22 where the photon creation and annihilation operators are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we normalize the electric field operators ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) so that the energy density of the microwave photon integrated over the volume @xmath25 is equal to @xmath26 , and analogously for the black - body photon .",
    "the effect of the electromagnetic fields is assumed to be a small perturbation of @xmath27 , so that a perturbative treatment of the dipole interaction of the atom with the electromagnetic field becomes possible .",
    "we first consider the second - order effect which gives the main energy perturbation of the helium atom due to the ac stark effect .",
    "a single - mode microwave field probes the helium atom in the ground state .",
    "the ground state energy is denoted as @xmath28 and and its schrdinger wave function is denoted as @xmath29 .",
    "first - order perturbation theory in @xmath30 gives a vanishing effect , and the leading correction to the energy @xmath28 is of second order .",
    "we then average over the polarizations and propagation directions of the microwave mode .",
    "we are interested in the classical limit where the number of microwave photons is @xmath31 , the normalization volume is large ( @xmath32 ) , but the ratio @xmath33 remains finite , and proportional to the intensity of the microwave field . using this formalism , one may easily rederive  @xcite the dynamic ac stark energy shift due to microwave photons , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the resolvent operator for the unperturbed helium atom , and @xmath36 ; that is , we are denoting the @xmath37th cartesian component of the sum @xmath38 of the positions @xmath39 and @xmath40 of both electrons simply by @xmath41 . for repeated superscripts and subscripts , we use the summation convention",
    "[ an example is given by the cartesian superscripts @xmath37 in eq.([pol ] ) ] .",
    "the sum over @xmath42 is necessary because we treat both photon absorption followed by emission as well as photon emission followed by absorption .",
    "the intensity @xmath43 of the microwave field in our normalization of the field operator is given as @xmath44 for our purposes ( ground state of helium perturbed by a microwave field ) , we may approximate to good accuracy the microwave frequency by the static limit ( @xmath45 ) in eq .  .",
    "then , the well - known final result in second order is rederived , @xmath46 where the static dipole polarizability ( divided by the square of the elementary charge @xmath47 ) in nonrelativistic limit for the ground state is defined by @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the reduced green function , where the reference state @xmath50 is excluded from the sum over intermediate ( virtual ) states .",
    "we now investigate the perturbation of the dipole polarizability @xmath3 due to the black - body radiation . this is a fourth - order process in the radiation field .",
    "the atom may emit then absorb photons from the microwave field and also emit then absorb photons from the black - body field .",
    "fourth - order perturbation theory , with time - independent field operators in the schrdinger picture , can then be used in order to infer the energy shift .",

    "@xmath54 where planck s law gives @xmath55 for room temperature , the black - body spectrum has its maximum at frequencies much below typical atomic transition frequencies .",

    "this approach serves two purposes : ( i ) to implicitly define the variational parameters used in the calculation of the resolvent @xmath182 in both the static as well as the dynamic regime , and ( ii ) to provide a reference value for the contribution of even - parity @xmath135 states to a fourth - order matrix element that has a manifestly nonvanishing static limit ( but no direct physical interpretation ) .    for the integration in eq .   over @xmath57 ,",

    "figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] illustrate the boltzmann weight of the integrand defining @xmath61 and the overall dependence of @xmath61 on the temperature . as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ defchi ] ) , @xmath61 is the multiplicative factor that gives the temperature - dependent effective static polarizability of helium in the presence of the black - body radiation .",
    "we have investigated the effect of black - body radiation on the determination of the helium molar polarizability by fourth - order perturbation theory in the quantized electromagnetic field of the probing microwave and the black - body radiation field .",
    "this shift of the molar polarizability is of interest because it may affect a conceivable definition of thermodynamic temperature or a determination of the boltzmann constant based on the measurement  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the relative correction to the polarizability amounts to a correction as large as @xmath195 at @xmath196 , which would have been significant compared to the @xmath197 relative uncertainty of the measurement @xcite .",
    "however , our fourth - order calculations indicate that the effect of black - body radiation on the measurement of the polarizability of helium reported in @xcite is negligible .",
    "in fact , the result of that measurement , @xmath198 , supports this conclusion .",
    "the calculation in @xcite considers only the frequency dependence , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for example , of the interaction of the black - body radiation with the atoms . in lowest order",
    ", this dependence does not affect the interaction of the microwave radiation with the atoms .    here",
    ", we have presented a fully quantized approach to the calculation of the black - body radiation correction to the polarizability of helium , and we have evaluated all expressions numerically [ see eq .  ] as well as within a semi - analytic approach [ see eq .  ] . however , even without this formalism , an estimate for the effect of the black - body radiation on the polarizability of helium at room temperature could have been performed based on known literature references , as follows .",
    "we start from the ground - state blackbody shift @xmath199 given by farley and wing  @xcite .",
    "( this value takes into account the 300k to 273k temperature difference as compared to ref .  @xcite . )",
    "this amounts to a relative change in the polarizability of order @xmath200 , which affects the virtual states in the defining expression for the ground state polarizability ( we denote by @xmath201 a typical transition frequency in helium ) . unlike the qed corrections , the black - body radiation effect is largest for highly - excited states , so a possibly larger correction would come from the shift of the excited - state energies due to the black - body radiation .",
    "these states enter the expression for the polarizability as virtual states , and the relative frequency of the virtual transitions leads to a proportional shift of the polarizability , as implied by the fourth - order effect given in eq .  .",
    "farley and wing find that the correction @xmath202 for each excited state @xmath37 approaches a limiting shift of @xmath203 as @xmath204  @xcite . for lower states ,",
    "this gives an overestimate because the black - body shifts for typical excited states are larger .",
    "nevertheless , if all excited state energies were shifted by this amount , then the polarizability would undergo a relative change of order @xmath205 , which needs to be contrasted to our exact result ( the latter is in the range of @xmath206 and confirms the overestimation ) .    in this article",
    ", we have carried out a detailed analysis of the effect , and obtained the precise shift of the polarizability in fourth - order perturbation theory , which can be expressed as a relative perturbation of the second order polarizability effect proportional to a dimensionless factor @xmath61 . our analytic formula given in eq .   and our numerical results obtained by numerically integrating the black - body spectrum",
    "confirm this estimate under the proviso that the shift of the lowest excited helium states , which is of the order of a few hertz , gives the relevant contribution to the polarizability .",
    "in particular , we find a shift of @xmath207 for the relative correction to the polarizability of the helium ground state .",
    "furthermore , according to eq .  , we find a @xmath186 dependence for the overall shift of the polarizability with an analytic dependence of the form @xmath208 .",
    "although we have carried out numerical calculations only up to a temperature @xmath209 , an analytic estimate based on the known form of the black - body spectrum shows that the formula  eq .   should be valid to better than @xmath210 in a temperature range to at least 2000k .",
    "finally , we would also like to briefly discuss the size of the effect for other noble gases like neon and argon , which are of experimental interest .",
    "the two - color hyperpolarizability scales as @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the effective nuclear charge seen by the electron in the valence shell .",
    "the final result for the shift of the polarizability due to the black - body radiation interaction is obtained as an integral over the dynamic two - color hyperpolarizability , and its value may thus additionally depend on the overlap of the resonance frequencies with the maximum of the temperature - dependent black - body spectrum . for temperatures not exceeding @xmath213 , however , the _",
    "static _ two - color hyperpolarizability of the noble gas in question should provide a good estimate of the total effect , according to eq .  .",
    "we thus expect that the result for @xmath61 in the temperature range @xmath214 for neon and argon should not differ from the result given in eq .   by more than two orders of magnitude and thus be negligible on the level of accuracy reached in the experiment  @xcite .",
