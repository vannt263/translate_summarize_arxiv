    "it is often necessary to measure the mass of an object that decays into hadronic jets .",
    "an example of current importance is the decay of the top quark @xmath3 , where the @xmath1 quark materializes as a jet and the @xmath4 boson decays either leptonically or into two light - quark jets .",
    "the accuracy with which the jets can be measured governs the error in the top quark mass measurement , which is crucial to the study of electroweak physics  e.g. , knowing @xmath5 allows a logarithmic estimate of the higgs boson mass in the minimal model .",
    "accurate measurement of the jet decays of the @xmath4 is also valuable here because good @xmath4 mass resolution can reduce the combinatoric and other backgrounds in the analysis .",
    "futhermore , the hadronically decaying @xmath4 can provide an alternative measure of @xmath5 based on the jet angles in the top rest frame @xcite : these angles determine @xmath6 in each event with errors that are largely independent from the errors of the traditional measure , so the two methods can be averaged to improve resolution . at the same time , @xmath7 events offer a sample of hadronic @xmath4 decays that can be compared against the known @xmath4 mass to test the theoretical and experimental assumptions underlying all jet spectroscopy .",
    "this opportunity is unique because hadronic @xmath4 decays are otherwise obscured by large qcd backgrounds and triggering problems @xcite .",
    "a second important application of jet spectroscopy occurs in the search for higgs boson @xmath2 .",
    "a moderate improvement in dijet mass resolution has been shown to extend the range of possible discovery to @xmath8 in tevatron run ii @xcite .",
    "the important sources of error in jet spectroscopy are ( 1 ) qcd radiation and hadronization effects , ( 2 ) jet definitions , and ( 3 ) detector effects .",
    "we will compare these sources of error quantitatively , using monte carlo simulation events for which the true partonic momenta are known , and we will study the degree to which the jet finding algorithm can be improved .",
    "there is an interplay between the first two sources of error because acceptable jet algorithms differ from one another at next - to - leading order in @xmath9 and in the nonperturbative hadronization corrections they require .",
    "previous top quark analyses @xcite have used cone algorithms for jet definition @xcite .",
    "but i will show in this paper that a particular version of the @xmath10 successive recombination algorithm @xcite instead promises superior results .",
    "the detector effects studied here are generic ones that arise from the basic segmented calorimeter design of all contemporary detectors .",
    "particular attention is paid to the unseen neutrino component of @xmath1 jets , which is found to be significant and partially correctable .",
    "dealing with the additional foibles of each specific apparatus must be left to the experimentalists .",
    "throughout this paper we investigate the experimentally favorable single - lepton ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) top quark channel @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 or their charge conjugates at the present tevatron energy @xmath16 .",
    "the results also apply rather directly to the six - jet channel where both @xmath17 and @xmath18 decay hadronically .    because of color confinement ,",
    "the quarks from top decay show themselves as jets of hadrons @xcite .",
    "one must infer the momenta of the quarks from measurements of the observed jets .",
    "because of the collinear and soft singularities of qcd , a quark naturally shares its momentum with accompanying gluons and/or @xmath19 pairs .",
    "it is necessary to include these as much as possible in order to capture the momentum of the original quark .",
    "sometimes the qcd radiation is so hard as to produce an extra separate isolated jet . in such events , reconstructing the mass of the original state is generally hopeless because the number of combinatoric possibilities resulting from the many possible sources of extra radiation is so large . in many events ,",
    "however , the effect of the qcd radiation is simply to broaden the jets in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "some of this territory has been explored previously @xcite .",
    "however , we use here a significantly improved simulation program with an up - to - date estimate of the top quark mass , and make a fuller study of the effect of different options and parameters in the jet definitions .",
    "also , we include the step of making `` jet energy corrections '' which has become standard experimental practice .",
    "events were simulated using the herwig 5.8 @xcite monte carlo event generator , which models both hard and soft qcd effects .",
    "herwig is known to agree well with jet data from @xmath21 interactions at values of @xmath22 comparable to those that arise in top quark decay @xcite .",
    "it also agrees well with next - to - leading order perturbative calculations of the distributions in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for @xmath7 production @xcite .",
    "the default herwig parameters were used , but i have checked that substituting parameters that have been tuned to fit jet data from @xmath21 interactions @xcite causes negligible change .",
    "herwig does not include decay correlations between the @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite , or the finite width of the top ; but these effects are probably not important for our purposes .",
    "using herwig for top production is not without risk in view of discrepancies with perturbative calculations that appear specifically for top quark production @xcite .",
    "i have incorporated a `` bug fix '' recently circulated by the authors of herwig @xcite , which substantially increases the amount of hard gluon radiation in top decays and removes the strong discrepancy shown in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "i assume @xmath26 in the simulation . to approximate standard experimental cuts ,",
    "i restrict the discussion to events in which the lepton from @xmath4 decay has transverse momentum @xmath27 and pseudorapidity @xmath28 , and its neutrino has @xmath29 .",

    "typical values are comparable to those for which herwig has been tested and tuned using data from lep @xcite .",
    "i impose a cut requiring all four of these partons to have @xmath33 .",
    "this cut keeps @xmath34 of the events that pass the lepton cuts .",
    "it is intended to simulate the effect of a cut on the minimum @xmath32 of the four highest @xmath32 jets observed in each event .",
    "the cut is made at the parton level in this simulation so that the different jet algorithms are compared fairly , by applying them to the same set of events .",
    "the partonic cut should be very similar to experimentally possible cuts on observed jet @xmath32  at least for the events that contribute to the signal , for which the four highest @xmath32 jets in fact correspond to the primary partons .",
    "the reduction in signal due to a fairly strong cut on the minimum @xmath32 of the observed four primary jets is a price worth paying , particularly as the total number of observed events rises , for several reasons : ( 1 ) it avoids the need to measure jets of low @xmath32 , which have intrinsically large fractional uncertainties as is quantified below ; ( 2 ) it increases the fraction of events for which the observed jets will be correctly matched to their original partons , especially since only the four jets with highest @xmath32 observed in each event will be analyzed to reduce the combinatoric background in assigning the jets ; and ( 3 ) @xmath32 cuts have been shown effective in suppressing the major background from @xmath35 processes without @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the detector is modelled as an array of @xmath36 cells in pseudorapidity @xmath37 and azimuthal angle @xmath38 .",
    "this granularity in the @xmath20 plane is similar to that of the current d detector , while cdf detector cells have width @xmath39 in @xmath38 .",
    "the detector is assumed to have no ability to identify particles , so the energy deposited in each cell according to the simulation is analyzed as if it came from a massless particle whose momentum direction pointed toward the center of the cell .",
    "( in real life , corrections must be made for the spreading of energy into neighboring cells due to the finite size of the shower generated by a single particle .",
    "this spreading also creates a possibility in principle to locate the direction of momentum more accurately than the cell size would predict . )",
    "we consider three different models for the energy resolution of the detector cells . in model a ( ideal ) , the total energy deposited in each cell is measured exactly , even including the contribution from neutrinos . in models",
    "b and c , the total energy in each cell is smeared by realistic gaussian errors of standard deviation @xmath40 given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 for charged hadrons ( mostly @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 , @xmath46 for @xmath47 , @xmath48 or @xmath12 ( mostly @xmath47 from @xmath49 ) .",
    "these parameters are approximately those of the d detector @xcite .",
    "models b and c differ only in that neutrinos are treated like electrons in b , while in c the detector is blind to neutrinos like a real detector .",
    "the purpose for this distinction is that we will find a sizeable difference between these two models because of the frequent presence of neutrinos in @xmath1 jets , and it may be possible to compensate for some of the neutrino component on an event - by - event basis using leptonic information that is acquired as a part of some @xmath1 tags .",
    "cells that receive @xmath50 are ignored in the analysis .",
    "this mimics a limitation of the d detector due to noise levels from its uranium calorimeter .",
    "but it may be a good idea anyway to drop contributions from very low @xmath32 particles , which are at best poorly associated with any jet direction in part because of hadron resonance decay effects and the difference between rapidity and pseudorapidity ; and because extraneous low @xmath32 particles are present from soft hadronic interactions that are additional to the hard scattering that produced @xmath7 ( `` background event '' ) and from independent @xmath51 interactions at high luminosity ( `` pileup '' ) .",

    "the mass resolutions we find therefore represent an optimistic limit for what can be expected .",
    "however , the neglected effects are generally small compared to those included , and they should in particular not affect our conclusions on the relative merits of different methods of analysis .      for jet spectroscopy , i advocate a particular version of the @xmath10 jet finding algorithm @xcite that is defined by the following explicit steps",

    "three - jet mass distributions from @xmath94 are shown in fig .  8 for the three models of calorimeter energy resolution .",
    "in generating these histograms , the best match to the four parton directions was again used to infer the jet assignments . but this time the best - fitting assignment is plotted for every event , without a cut on the quality of the fit .",
    "this makes the simulation more realistic , since it includes backgrounds of a type that will be present in actual data analysis .",
    "the jet assignments are needed to know which three of the four jets come from the hadronic top decay , and also because linear jet energy corrections are made using eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrections ] ) with parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 that are slightly different for @xmath1 jets and light - quark jets according to figs .",
    "thanks to the jet energy corrections , the peaks are centered very close to the input value @xmath26 .",
    "their shapes are not symmetrical , but are instead skewed toward low masses since qcd radiation and loss due to neutrinos can substantially reduce the observed energy of a jet , but can not increase it .",
    "the widths of these peaks can be measured by fitting the histograms to a gaussian plus a linear background over the fairly narrow mass range @xmath95 : this is useful for purposes of comparison , even though the resulting fits are not statistically adequate at the high statistics at which the histograms have been computed .",
    "the resulting gaussian peaks correspond to standard deviations of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 for the three models of resolution .",
    "fitting over a different mass range results in somewhat different numbers , but leads to the same qualitative conclusions .",
    "the mass resolution for @xmath5 can be improved by replacing the usual invariant mass estimate , which is based on the sum of the 4-momenta of the three jets , by the average of that value and a mass estimate based on the jet angles in the top rest frame @xcite .",
    "three - jet mass distributions obtained using this average variable are shown in fig .",
    "these peaks are more symmetrical than those of fig .  8 because fluctuations in the jet angle part of the mass measurement have no definite sign .",
    "the peaks are narrower in each case , with widths @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath97 for the three models of resolution .",
    "this demonstrates the value of the jet angle method .",
    "the dependence on the assumed calorimeter cell threshold is not large .",
    "for example , raising the threshold from @xmath52 to @xmath101 increases the width of the mass peak by only @xmath102 in the case of model b for the energy resolution .",
    "similarly , lowering the threshold to @xmath103 narrows the peak by @xmath102",
    ". the actual effect would be even less than that because the `` background event , '' which contributes random noise at low @xmath32 , has not been included in the simulation .",
    "the dependence on the jet radius parameter @xmath59 of the @xmath10 algorithm is also not large . the original choice @xmath60 is found to be close to optimal .",
    "going to @xmath104 or @xmath105 results in mass peaks that are a few percent broader .",
    "one might wonder if the @xmath10 algorithm could be improved in some cases by revising its assignment of cells to jets according to their proximity to the jet axes it finds . to test this ,",
    "the following plausible modification was tried : after completing the work of the @xmath10 algorithm on each event , any cell above the @xmath52 threshold was reassigned to the nearest of the four highest @xmath32 jet axes if the cell was within @xmath106 of that axis and ( 1 ) it was previously assigned to a different jet whose axis is farther away than this new one by a factor @xmath107 , or ( 2 ) it was previously not assigned to any jet .",
    "this modification affected only @xmath108 of the events , almost entirely through option ( 1 ) .",
    "it produced a small improvement in energy resolution for that subset of events , but the improvement was not large enough to make it worthwhile to `` second - guess '' the @xmath10 algorithm in this way .",
    "the analysis of jet data at hadron colliders has traditionally been done using cone algorithms , in which a jet is defined as the final particles within a circle of fixed radius @xmath109 in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "a typical cone size is @xmath110 ; but smaller values like @xmath111 have been used for processes like @xmath7 production , to improve the sensitivity to configurations where partons lie close together in the @xmath20 plane at the expense of increased errors in the partonic momentum measurement due to fluctuations in the qcd radiation lying outside the cone .",
    "cone algorithms are not at all straightforward to design , nor even to describe , because of ambiguities in how to treat situations in which jets overlap .",
    "overlap occurs to some degree whenever two jet axes lie within @xmath112 of each other in @xmath20 , which happens in the majority of events of the type we are considering .",
    "i have repeated the analysis of section [ sec : simulation ] with the @xmath10 algorithm replaced by a cone algorithm @xcite that begins with clustering based on equivalence classes @xcite .",
    "i have also repeated the analysis using a version of the cone algorithm by seymour @xcite , which is patterned after current practice .",
    "a cone radius @xmath110 was used in both cases .",
    "the results achieved by these two cone algorithms , which are alike in intent but very different in implementation , are strikingly similar to each other .",
    "cone algorithms generally do not allow the final jet momenta to lie within @xmath109 of each other .",
    "this leads to a significant loss of events in the top analysis , where the nearest pair of the four primary partons lie within @xmath106 of each other in @xmath113 of the events .",
    "it shows up quickly on repeating the analysis of sect .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] , in that @xmath114 of the events for the algorithm of ref .",
    "@xcite , or @xmath115 for the algorithm of ref .",
    "@xcite , are rejected because fewer than the required four jets with @xmath116 are found , as compared to only @xmath117 for the @xmath10 algorithm .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of errors in the best fit to the partonic angles is broader for the cone algorithms than for @xmath10 .    for events in which the necessary four jets are found , both",
    "cone algorithms perform almost as well as the @xmath10 one .",
    "in particular , the final @xmath118 distributions are quite similar to those shown in figs .  89 , especially for the cases in which realistic calorimeter energy resolution is included , which masks the differences .",
    "the average energy corrections needed for the cone algorithms are also similar to those for the @xmath10 algorithm , although slightly larger .",
    "one could therefore say that the @xmath10 algorithm provides only slightly better mass resolution than the cone algorithms , but allows approximately @xmath119 more events to be kept .",
    "another way to compare the algorithms would be to impose a cut on the minimum separation between observed jets in @xmath20 for the @xmath10 algorithm , or to raise the @xmath32 threshold for defining jets in it , or to make a combination of such cuts that would make the fraction of events kept by the various algorithms the same .",
    "the benefits of the @xmath10 algorithm would then appear entirely in the form of improved mass resolution .    the solid curve in fig .",
    "10 shows the fraction of events for which a good match is found between the 4 highest @xmath32 jets found by the @xmath10 algorithm and the 4 primary partons ( using a criterion based on the quality of fit to the @xmath20 direction and @xmath32 of all four ) as a function of the minimum separation between jets as observed by the algorithm .",
    "the algorithm is seen to have significant success even at minimum separations below @xmath120 . meanwhile , the two versions of cone algorithm with @xmath121 ( dotted and dashed curves in fig .",
    "10 ) are somewhat less effective overall , and are completely unable to see separations smaller than the assumed cone size .",
    "a smaller cone size could be used to extend the effectiveness of the cone algorithms to smaller minimum separation , as cdf and d0 have both done ; but that would reduce the accuracy of the @xmath32 measurements , and hence reduce the overall fraction of good matches .",
    "( as an aside , the curves shown in fig .",
    "10 are seen to turn over at large minimum separation .",
    "this may at first sight be puzzling , but it only reflects the fact that large separation between all 6 pairs of partons is very unlikely , so if the jet finder sees such a configuration , it is likely to be mistaken . )    in setting up the definitive top quark data analysis , the best choice of cuts on minimum jet - jet angular separation and minimum jet @xmath32 will have to be determined using a full simulation of both the detector and the complete analysis procedure .",
    "optimal choices for the cuts for the purpose of mass measurement will also depend on the number of events available for analysis , since one can afford statistically to cut harder when there are more events to begin with .",
    "another way to compare the @xmath10 and cone algorithms was carried out to study the ability to analyze objects that decay into two jets in the presence of additional jets , which will be necessary in the higgs boson search .",
    "for this study , @xmath7 events were generated as before except for an additional cut requiring the partons from @xmath4 decay to be separated from each other by @xmath122 in the @xmath58 plane .",
    "this cut is minor because these jets tend to be opposite each other in azimuthal angle and hence well separated .",
    "the ideal calorimeter model was used .",
    "the events were analyzed as before except that all jets found by the jet finder were kept and there was no requirement that four or more jets be found .",
    "the pair of jets ( at least two jets were always found ) making the best fit in @xmath58 to the two partons from @xmath4 decay were identified .",
    "linear jet energy corrections were applied as before to these jets .",
    "the invariant mass of the pair was computed and corrected for the deviation of the partonic @xmath4 mass from its nominal value , to remove the effect of finite @xmath4 width that is included in the simulation .",
    "the resulting distribution in dijet mass is shown in fig .",
    "11 for the @xmath10 algorithm and the two versions of cone algorithm .",
    "the distributions are normalized to the same number of events , so the superiority of the @xmath10 method is demonstrated by the fact that its peak is significantly higher .",
    "this is true even though the _ width _ of the peak  measured by full width at half maximum above background or `` by eye ''  is not obviously better .",
    "the point is that many events are so clean that all three jet finders give almost identical results for them .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "12 , which shows the distribution of the total root - mean - square deviation between the two jets identified as coming from the @xmath4 and their true parton directions , i.e. the quantity that was minimized to identify the `` correct '' jet pair .",
    "compared to the @xmath10 algorithm , the two cone algorithms both have relatively strong tails into a region of large deviation where the @xmath4 decay axes have not been located very well .",
    "these tails result mainly from events in which the jet finder includes contributions to a @xmath4 decay jet from particles actually coming from a @xmath1 jet that happens to lie nearby in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "this explains the tails extending toward higher @xmath123 in fig .",
    "the @xmath10 algorithm is less easily confused by such particles .",
    "89 show that there is a substantial loss in mass resolution caused by fluctuations in the neutrino component of @xmath1 jets . to study this in more detail , fig .",
    "13 shows the distribution of the observable ( i.e. , non - neutrino ) fraction of jet momentum @xmath124 for @xmath1-jets that contain at least one neutrino .",
    "the log - log plot reveals that the distribution can be rather well approximated by a power law : @xmath125 with @xmath126 for @xmath127 . the dotted curve in fig .",
    "13 shows the distribution for the subset of jets that contain an @xmath128 or @xmath129 with @xmath130 , which may be detected experimentally  especially in the case of @xmath129 .",
    "the two distributions are nearly identical .",
    "distributions with stronger or weaker cuts on the @xmath32 of @xmath128 or @xmath129 , or with cuts on @xmath89 , are also about the same .",
    "we can use this power law over the entire range @xmath131 because the neutrino contribution to @xmath32 is small compared to other errors in jet energy measurement in the tiny region @xmath132 where the power law does nt fit well . including the contribution from jets without neutrinos then gives a normalized parametrization of the distribution in observable momentum fraction @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the fraction of jets with negligible or zero neutrino contribution .",
    "for all @xmath1 jets , @xmath135 which implies that @xmath136 of them hide @xmath137 of their momentum in neutrinos and @xmath138 of them hide @xmath139 .",
    "for the @xmath140 of @xmath1 jets that contain an electron or muon with @xmath130 , @xmath134 is only @xmath141 which implies that @xmath142 of them hide @xmath137 of their momentum in neutrinos and @xmath114 of them hide @xmath139 .",
    "it is thus clearly advantageous to use different estimates to correct for the missing neutrino energy in a @xmath1 jet , depending on whether or not a lepton is observed in the jet .",
    "this has already been done in the analysis of the top quark signal @xcite . a topic",
    "worthy of future study would be to see if any further details of the observed jet , in addition to the mere presence or absence of a lepton , can be used to further improve the neutrino momentum estimate .",
    "it is interesting that the distribution in missing neutrino energy fraction when a lepton is observed is nearly independent of the energy of that lepton , except for the difference in probability that the missing energy is negligible or zero .",
    "additionally , the probability distribution for the error in jet momentum measurement is very asymmetric and very far from gaussian .",
    "this should be taken into account in the @xmath7 final state reconstruction analysis .",
    "so far , we have compared jet algorithms by making explicit use of the original parton momenta to infer the correspondence between jets and partons .",
    "this facilitates a detailed comparison of the methods , but it is somewhat artificial , since it can never be carried out using real data for which underlying partonic information is unknown . in this section",
    "we compare the jet algorithms directly , using no information that exists only in the world of monte carlo .    an appealing way to make the comparison would be to simulate a full data analysis recommended for @xmath7 events , and see how the choice of jet algorithm affects the uncertainty in measuring @xmath5 .",
    "the treatment of measurement errors in that analysis , however , is very complicated ; and further complications arise from the role played by missing @xmath32 in identifying the leptonically decaying @xmath4 , and from the existence of a variety of classes of events with regard to @xmath1-tagging information ( zero , one , or two tags with varying degrees of certainty ) .",
    "the complete comparison can therefore only be done properly by the experimentalists who are in a position to use full simulations of the detector , and who can make the comparison with data as well as with monte carlo events .    in order to test our methods directly , but without carrying out the full @xmath7 analysis , herwig events were generated as before except that all parton - level cuts were removed .",
    "the intermediate model of the calorimeter was used , i.e. , energy resolution was included , but neutrinos were assumed to be observable . instead of using partonic information to infer the jet assignments , a trijet mass distribution was found by simply plotting a histogram of @xmath118 formed from each subset of 3 of the 4 highest @xmath32 jets .",
    "events with fewer than 4 jets were ignored .",
    "the minimum jet @xmath32 was chosen slightly differently for the different jet algorithms to make the fraction of events kept the same for each algorithm .",
    "the histograms of @xmath118 are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath10 algorithm ( solid curve ) produces a clear peak above the combinatoric background .",
    "that background is very large because even events that are analyzed correctly contribute three incorrect combinations to the histogram in addition to the correct one .",
    "the two cone algorithms ( dashed and dotted curves ) produce nearly identical results .",
    "they show a peak that is significantly smaller and broader than the result of the @xmath10 algorithm .    in a full analysis , @xmath1-tagging and the constraint from the hadronic @xmath4 decay mass would greatly reduce the combinatoric background is fig .  14 , and accentuate the difference between the methods .",
    "the signal peaks would also be slightly narrower because different jet energy corrections could be made for the @xmath1 quark and light quark jets , in place of the cruder method of just making an average correction for all jets , which was used in generating fig .",
    "we have seen that a form of the @xmath10 successive recombination jet algorithm offers a significant improvement in the fraction of @xmath7 events that can be reconstructed and/or offers significantly improved @xmath17 mass resolution at the same efficiency , compared with cone algorithms like those that have been used up to now for @xmath7 data analysis .",
    "the basis of this is the flexibility of the @xmath10 algorithm with respect to jet radius : it can include final particles in a cone as large as @xmath143 or even greater when possible , while maintaining some useable efficiency for resolving jets down to as close as @xmath144 .",
    "the improved mass resolution that can be obtained using jet angle variables in the top rest frame @xcite has also been confirmed .",
    "the size of these improvements and the importance of an accurate top quark mass measurement are such that the procedure should be carried out in spite of the considerable work that will be necessary to reevaluate the instrumental corrections using the new methods .",
    "the particular form of the @xmath10 algorithm advocated here is characterized by a simple rule for when to terminate the process of combining protojets into jets , as described explicitly in sect .",
    "[ sec : jetdef ] .",
    "the dependence on parameters appearing in the algorithm is discussed in sect .  [",
    "sec : topmassres ] . with this algorithm ,",
    "the mass resolution is close to optimal in the sense that the majority of the width of the final mass peak is generated by the nominal energy resolution of a typical detector , so not much further improvement is theoretically possible .",
    "we have seen that fluctuations in the momentum carried by neutrinos contributes significantly to the error in measuring the momentum of a @xmath1 jet .",
    "this error is reduced in current practice @xcite by using different distributions according to whether or not a lepton is identified in the jet .",
    "a matter for future study is to see if any other features of the observed jet can be used to further improve the estimate .",
    "finally , both the improved jet algorithm and the improved estimate of neutrino contributions can help also in the search for other heavy objects that decay into jets , such as higgs boson @xmath2 @xcite .",
