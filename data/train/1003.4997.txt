    "_ isolated _ leptons along with missing transverse energy @xmath3 are typical signatures for new physics processes at collider energies .",
    "a much - anticipated example of charged dilepton production is higgs boson decay , @xmath4 followed by purely leptonic decays of the @xmath5 intermediate vector bosons .",
    "charged trilepton production may arise from the associated production of a chargino @xmath6 and a neutralino @xmath7 in supersymmetric ( susy ) models , followed by the leptonic decays of the chargino and neutralino .",
    "there are many standard model ( sm ) sources of isolated leptons . the nature and magnitude of contributions from semileptonic decays of heavy flavors ( bottom and charm quarks )",
    "are emphasized in two papers  @xcite .",
    "the role of heavy flavor backgrounds in @xmath8 at fermilab tevatron and cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies is presented in ref .",
    "we simulate the contributions from processes with @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks in the final state , including @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we study the signal and backgrounds for @xmath14 . we include heavy - flavor contributions to the backgrounds from @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "we learn that isolation cuts do not generally remove leptons from heavy - flavor sources as backgrounds to multilepton searches .",
    "a sequence of complex physics cuts is needed , conditioned by the new physics one is searching for .",
    "moreover , the heavy - flavor backgrounds can not be easily extrapolated from more general samples .",
    "the interplay between isolation and various physics cuts tends to emphasize corners of phase space rather than the bulk characteristics .",
    "while the heavy - flavor backgrounds can be overwhelming , we propose specific new cuts that can help in dealing with them , and we suggest methods for _ in situ _ verification of the background estimates .",
    "our finding that the dominant backgrounds to low - momentum dilepton and trilepton signatures come from real @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays may be met with some skepticism . since our publications ,",
    "important collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) data  @xcite have appeared that allow us to make a quantitative comparison at tevatron collider energies .",
    "we report the results of our comparison in this paper .",
    "specifically , these data allow us to verify how well we model isolation of leptons for events classified as originating from the `` drell - yan '' processes , in which virtual photons @xmath21 and intermediate vector bosons @xmath5 and @xmath22 are produced and decay into leptons . in addition , since we predict the absolute rate of heavy - flavor production and the drell - yan processes , we can check whether the data agree with our prediction of the rates of isolated leptons from these sources .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : compare ] , we present our detailed comparison with the cdf data , using the same control regions defined in their study , and using the same detector simulations and event generation methods of our previous papers  @xcite .",
    "we obtain good agreement with the cdf data , both validating our simulations and showing that our estimates of the magnitude of the heavy - flavor contribution are conservative .",
    "the added confidence in our understanding of the backgrounds from heavy - flavor sources motivates another look at one aspect of our study of @xmath23 .",
    "our results show a sharp fall of the contribution from heavy - flavor decays at large values of the dilepton transverse mass distribution .",
    "this falloff is too steep to reflect only the drop with transverse momentum of the cross section for heavy - flavor production . in sec .",
    "[ sec : isofilter ] , we explain how isolation serves as a narrow bandpass filter on the momentum of the leptons , thus explaining the steep decrease at high mass .",
    "a discussion of the implications of our results is found in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we utilize the effect of the bandpass filter on @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays as a way to develop a simple rule - of - thumb that 1/200 of every produced bottom or charm quark is seen as an isolated muon , and another 1/200 is seen as an isolated electron , each with roughly the momentum of the heavy quark .",
    "we end this introduction with a general discussion of isolation and a summary of its effects .    given a lepton track and a cone of size @xmath24 in rapidity and azimuthal angle space , the lepton is said to be _ isolated _ if the sum of the transverse energy of all other particles within the cone is less than a predetermined value ( either a constant or a value that scales with the transverse momentum of the lepton ) .",
    "our simulations based on the known semileptonic decays of bottom and charm hadrons show that leptons which satisfy isolation take a substantial fraction of the momentum of the parent heavy hadron .",
    "moreover , isolation leaves @xmath25 muons per parent @xmath1 quark .",
    "the potential magnitude of the background from heavy - flavor decays may be appreciated from the fact that the inclusive @xmath26 cross section at lhc energies is about @xmath27  pb . a suppression of @xmath28 from isolation of two leptons still leaves a formidable rate of isolated dileptons . for the isolated leptons ,",
    "our simulations show that roughly @xmath29 of the events satisfy isolation because the remnant is just outside whatever cone is used for the tracking and energy cuts , and another @xmath29 pass because the lepton took nearly all the energy , meaning there is nothing left to reject upon .",
    "the latter events are not candidates to reject with impact parameter cuts since they tend to point to the primary vertex .",
    "although the decay leptons are `` relatively '' soft , we find that their associated backgrounds extend well into the region of new physics with relatively large mass scales , such as a higgs boson with mass @xmath30  gev .",
    "in their analysis of isolated leptons from @xmath1 decay @xcite , cdf defines several control regions in order to disentangle the effects of different backgrounds . in fig.[fig : regions ] , we reproduce fig .",

    "the cdf region s is designed as a signal region for their trilepton study ( but examines dimuons here ) with @xmath34 gev , @xmath35 jet , @xmath36  gev , and excludes region z. regions b , c , and d complement region s : region b is a subset of region z , with @xmath34  gev ; region c is a subset of region a with @xmath37  gev and excludes the overlap with region z ; and region d is the same as region s , but requires at least 2 jets .",
    "our goal is to compare directly with the cdf measurement of isolated leptons from @xmath1 decay @xcite in each of the control regions defined above using exactly the same detector simulations and methods as our previous papers @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the contributions from @xmath38 pair production , with the semileptonic decay @xmath39 , and the drell - yan process @xmath40 .",
    "we also consider the contributions from @xmath5 bosons plus heavy flavors ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) , though they contribute significantly only to region s. we do not include muons from light - quark jets , such as @xmath47 or @xmath48 decays , which are usually classified as `` fakes . ''",

    "these @xmath47-factors are calculated via the nlo program mcfm @xcite including cuts that mimic the final sample in order to more accurately predict the result in the region of cdf acceptance .    in order to compare to the cdf data , we scale our results to those observed in region z , the @xmath22-peak , where we do not expect any signal from @xmath38 events .",
    "theoretical errors due to parton distribution functions and monte carlo statistics are included , but they are smaller than the error propagated from the experimental measurement of region z used to normalize the data .",
    "we see in table  [ tab : results ] that with this scaling we reproduce well the results for drell - yan production in control regions a and c  the regions with the most statistical significance .",

    "the probability to produce a lepton above some threshold , e.g. , @xmath56 gev is convolved with the probability of missing the rest of the @xmath1 or @xmath2 decay remnant . for completeness , we reproduce the shape of this efficiency using an atlas - like detector simulation for muons as a function of the @xmath57 of the quark in fig .

    "this effect is clearly present in fig.[fig : muvbb ] , where the peak for muons with @xmath61 gev in @xmath38 production comes from 20 gev @xmath1 s .",
    "previously @xcite , we focused on the low - momentum end of this spectrum , noting that a significant fraction of isolated leptons arise from @xmath1 s just above threshold for production . hence , to properly model this background , @xmath1 and @xmath2 must be modeled all the way down to threshold .",
    "gev from @xmath38 production and decay ( solid ) , or an isolated muon ( dashed ) .",
    "[ fig : muvbb],width=288 ]    in this section , we focus on the upper end of the isolated lepton spectrum as a function of @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) transverse momentum .",
    "the long tail of acceptance in fig .",
    "[ fig : muvptb ] is suppressed by the sharply falling @xmath1 transverse momentum spectrum .",
    "the net result is that the isolation acts as a _",
    "narrow bandpass filter on momentum_. this observation has a critical importance for higher - scale physics , such as higgs boson production .    in the dilepton analysis of a higgs boson decaying to @xmath62 to dileptons",
    "we observe that the transverse - mass @xmath63 spectrum due to @xmath38/@xmath49 and @xmath64heavy flavors drops sharply at large @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mthmm](a ) the background from heavy flavors falls through the middle of higgs boson signals for masses in the range 140200 gev . raising the @xmath60 threshold of the _ second - highest @xmath60 lepton _ from 10 gev to 20 gev pushes this leading edge to lower transverse mass , fig .",
    "[ fig : mthmm](b ) , thereby recovering our ability to extract a higgs signal in the dilepton channel despite the heavy - flavor background .    considering lepton isolation criteria as a _ narrow bandpass filter _ , we see that the sharp high-@xmath63 edge is due to the cutoff of large - momentum @xmath1 s by this filtering mechanism . hence , even though we are modeling the tail of a steeply falling spectrum , the filtering effect of lepton isolation acts to safely suppress the region where we expect our @xmath63 shapes to be less - well defined .",
    "the net result of this filter is to provide a more robust determination of the shape of the background from isolated leptons .",
    "in this paper we predict the rate of isolated muons from b decay in order to compare directly with data from the cdf collaboration .",
    "the central conclusion to draw is that isolated leptons from @xmath1 decays are a large fraction of the low transverse momentum lepton sample . in the case of the cdf measurement",
    "we _ under - predict _ the measured rate of dimuons from @xmath1 decay using the same codes and procedures we use to estimate the background to dilepton and trilepton signatures at the tevatron and lhc @xcite .",
    "hence , we are confident that these backgrounds will play an important role in the extraction of higgs boson decays to @xmath65 , trilepton supersymmetry , and indeed all processes with any low transverse momentum electron or muon .",
    "given the broad nature of our conclusions , and the significant computing resources required to model these backgrounds properly , we introduce a new `` rule - of - thumb '' to determine whether these leptons may be problematic in any given analysis :    * replace 1/200 of every produced @xmath1 or @xmath2 quark with a muon , and 1/200 with an electron having the same momentum as the @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "* if the resulting background is more than 10% of the signal , it should be simulated more carefully , and eventually measured _ in situ_.    this new rule - of - thumb works precisely because the lepton isolation criteria act as a bandpass filter selecting leptons from @xmath1 or @xmath2 quarks whose transverse momenta are only slightly above the momentum of the lepton . in general",
    ", this rule - of - thumb is valid for large transverse momentum leptons as well .",
    "fortunately , the production rates for @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks tend to fall rapidly ( with the exception of @xmath1 decays from top quarks , which peak near 5060 gev ) .",
    "overall , we strongly recommend that all analyses involving leptons consider the background from the decay of heavy - flavor hadrons , as many analyses are sensitive to regions of phase space in which this background is enhanced .",
