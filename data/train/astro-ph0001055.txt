    "irregular galaxies gained a central position in extragalactic studies , as the most abundant and least evolved galaxies in the universe .",
    "it was soon understood that they are not closed systems , and that galactic winds had to play a relevant role in their chemical evolution .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations of irregular galaxies lead to conflicting conclusions : de young & gallagher ( 1990 ) , de young & heckman ( 1994 ) and maclow & ferrara ( 1999 ) found that irregulars can lose a significant fraction of metals via galactic winds ; conversely , silich & tenorio - tagle ( 1998 ) concluded that a low - density gaseous halo can inhibit the loss of matter from dwarf galaxies .",
    "models of chemical evolution of irregular galaxies suggested that galactic winds can explain the chemical properties of these objects ( matteucci & chiosi 1983 ; matteucci & tosi 1985 ; pilyugin 1993 , 1996 ; marconi et al 1994 ; bradamante et al 1998 , and many others ) .",
    "outflows of ionized gas have been observed in a number of irregular galaxies ( marlowe et al 1995 ) .",
    "skillman ( 1997 ) has summarized the pros and cons for galactic wind  dominated evolution of irregular galaxies and has concluded that neither case is very strong .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,<,<,^,^,<,^ , < \" , ]     the global oxygen abundance deficiency is defined as @xmath0 .",
    "the values of @xmath1 are given in column 4 of table [ table : comdat ] .",
    "the positions of irregular galaxies in the @xmath2  o / h diagram shown on fig.[figure:9368f6 ] by circles .",
    "the curve defined by the one - zone closed - box models with different gas mass fraction ( this curve will be referred to as standard curve ) is shown on fig.[figure:9368f6 ] as a solid line .",
    "for comparison we show the positions for various regions of the two spiral galaxies ngc  5457 ( dashed line with crosses ) and ngc  2403 ( dashed line with lozenges ) ( data from pilyugin & ferrini 1998 ) .",
    "ngc  5457 has no oxygen abundance deficiency , and ngc  2403 has the largest global oxygen abundance deficiency ( @xmath3 ) among the spiral galaxies considered by pilyugin and ferrini ( 1998 ) . as it can be seen in fig.[figure:9368f6 ] ,",
    "all the irregular galaxies are significantly displaced from the standard curve .",
    "their values of oxygen abundance deficiency are also in excess of that in the dwarf spiral galaxy ngc  2403 .",
    "the values of oxygen abundance deficiency range from @xmath4 0.5 to @xmath4 0.9 . the relationships between the value of oxygen abundance deficiency and global parameters will be given in one of the next papers of this series .",
    "since irregular galaxies are gas - rich systems ( as it can be seen from table [ table : comdat ] the mass of gas component exceeds the mass of the stellar component in the galaxy ) the total luminous mass to luminosity ratio @xmath5 is significantly larger than the value of star mass to luminosity ratio @xmath6 ( compare the data from columns 2 and 5 of table [ table : comdat ] ) .",
    "can the oxygen abundance deficiency within optical edge of irregular galaxy be explained by the mixing of interstellar matter with gas outside the optical edge ? to study this possibility ,",
    "the oxygen abundance deficiency have been re ",
    "computed under the assumption that all the gas associated with a galaxy is well mixed . in this case",
    "the mass of gas in the galaxy is @xmath7 all the other values are derived in the same way as in the previous case .",
    "the values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath8 are listed in columns 6 - 8 of table [ table : comdat ] .",
    "the positions of irregular galaxies in the @xmath2  o / h diagram in the present case are shown on fig.[figure:9368f7 ] : significant displacements of irregular galaxies relative to the standard curve remain .",
    "the inclusion of extended hi envelope outside the optical radius only slightly decreases the displacement of irregular galaxies relative to the standard curve .",
    "we have found that all the irregular galaxies considered here have a significant oxygen abundance deficiency .",
    "this is a strong argument in favor of an important role of mass exchange with the environment in the chemical evolution of these galaxies .",
    "these conclusions remain even if one takes into consideration the gas envelope observed outside the optical edge .",
    "this confirm the widespread idea that a significant part of the heavy elements is ejected by irregular galaxies in the intergalactic medium .",
    "we emphasize that the relation between oxygen abundance vs. gas mass fraction in the closed box model used in present study was constructed so that the positions of the most metal - rich giant spiral galaxies ( including ngc  5457 ) in the @xmath2 -o / h diagram are fitted by this relation ( pilyugin & ferrini 1998 ) .",
    "therefore the oxygen abundance deficiency of irregular galaxies can also be considered as relative to the giant spiral galaxy ngc  5457 .",
    "it has been found by pilyugin & ferrini ( 1998 ) that the precise choice of the oxygen production by individual stars and of the parameters of the initial mass function are not critical in this differential comparison .",
