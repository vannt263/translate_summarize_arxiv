    "the main conclusion from our analysis of the stellar populations within the effective radius is that the process of formation started at redshift z@xmath210 and lasted for about @xmath02.5  gyr .",
    "the addition of an extra , younger , component to the analysis allows for up to 20% in mass of a population with an age of @xmath0150  myr , with a modest amount of dust reddening ( e(b  v)@xmath60.4  mag ) , therefore with the bulk of stellar populations having formed at an earlier phase .",
    "the long @xmath120 of the models along with the lack of star forming features in the spectrum suggests a truncation of the star formation over a few hundreds of myr .",
    "taking into account the stellar mass of the galaxy , we can infer a sustained star formation rate during its bursting phase in the range 30110m@xmath4/yr ( with the quoted range including the difference between the stellar masses according to bc07 or cm05 models ) .",

    ", we note that this disagreement is caused by the difference in the treatment of evolved phases of stellar evolution , with tp - agb stars contributing significantly more to the luminosity in the cm05 models , thereby reducing the m / l especially for the ages considered .",

    "two main scenarios can be brought forward : i ) the onset of a galactic superwind from stellar feedback : a sustained star formation rate of about @xmath0100m@xmath4/yr for a couple of gyr will provide enough energy ; ii ) the previous merging process that resulted in the formation of fw4871 could be the ultimate cause of the quenching , possibly by switching of the agn @xcite .",
    "the morphological appearance of fw4871 , and the x - ray detection of this source @xcite points to the latter . in this case , the recent merging process to form fw4871 could be considered as the cause of truncation .",
    "one could envision fw4871 as a high redshift equivalent of a post - starburst , or k+a galaxy .",
    "the analysis of the environment in a sample of k+a galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite reveals that the truncation of the star - bursting phase is caused by the interaction with a nearby companion , a similar mechanism to the one contemplated here .",
