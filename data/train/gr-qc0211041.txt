    "current theoretical understanding , stemming both from general relativity and astrophysics , places black hole binaries at the top of the list of candidate sources for the interferometric gravitational - wave detectors that are nearing the completion of their construction phase . on the one hand , black hole binaries are by far sources whose dynamics (",
    "early inspiral and late time quasi - normal mode ringing to a large extent , late inspiral , plunge and merger to a lesser extent ) is better understood than other sources , such as supernovae or relativistic instabilities in neutron stars , so that it is possible to construct reasonably good template waveforms to extract signals out of noise . on the other hand , astrophysical rate estimates of black hole binary coalescences , though not known accurately , have a range whose upper limit is large enough to expect a few mergers per year within a distance of 150 mpc @xcite .",
    "the merger phase of binaries consisting of two @xmath0 black holes takes place right in the heart of the ligo - virgo - geo sensitivity band giving us the best possible picture of this highly non - linear evolution .",
    "eventually , when detectors reach good sensitivity levels , one hopes to learn experimentally about this strong gravity regime which has been a subject of intense analytical and numerical studies for more than a decade .",
    "in the meantime , what is needed is a set of model waveforms or templates that describe the dynamics close to the merger phase accurately enough so that only a small fraction @xmath1 of all events will go undetected .",
    "two general viewpoints are possible to reach this goal . a maximalist one or a minimalist one .",
    "the _ maximalist _",
    "viewpoint consists in enlarging as much as is conceivable ( using in a `` democratic '' way all available methods in the literature for treating binary coalescence ) the bank of filters , with the hope that even the methods which appear a priori less reliable than others might , by accident , happen to describe a good approximation to the `` real '' signal .",
    "this is the viewpoint taken by buonanno , chen and vallisneri in their careful , and detailed analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the basis of which they advocate expanding the net by using a multiparameter template family able to approximate most of the results of the conceivable analytical methods .",
    "however , this `` democratic '' attitude comes at a cost that calls for an alternate strategy that we explore here .",
    "the problem with this method is that it leads to a dramatic increase in the total number of templates from @xmath2 templates to @xmath3 templates ; which has the bad consequence that it leads a larger false alarm rate .",
    "( these estimates of the number of templates are those obtained , as in @xcite , by `` dividing '' the parameter space by the local span of the template at the minimal match .",
    "this is an underestimate because it neglects boundary effects .",
    "for instance , a more realistic estimate of the number of the third post - newtonian effective - one - body templates would be @xmath4 rather than 25 . )",
    "by contrast , we advocate here a _ minimalist _",
    "viewpoint consisting in ( i ) focussing exclusively on the best available analytical description , and ( ii ) generalizing this description by adding several parameters that describe `` new directions '' corresponding to physical effects not perfectly modelled by this description .",
    "the most important of these directions are the effects due to higher post - newtonian ( pn ) effects , not yet calculated , but known to exist .",
    "a thorough study of the robustness of our preferred description against the inclusion of currently unknown effects should allow an informed and judicious covering of the parameter space of interest without overtly expanding the size of the total bank of templates .",
    "the best available analytical description at present is , in our opinion , the `` effective - one - body '' ( eob ) approach proposed and constructed for non - spinning bodies at second post - newtonian ( 2pn ) order by buonanno and damour @xcite , extended to third post - newtonian ( 3pn ) order by damour , jaranowski and schfer @xcite and generalized to spinning bodies by damour @xcite . on the one hand , the eob maps , using the hamilton - jacobi formalism , the real `` conservative '' ( in the absence of radiation reaction ) dynamics of two bodies with masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 into an eob problem of a test particle of mass @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , moving ( essentially ) in an effective background metric @xmath10 which is a deformation of the schwarzschild metric with deformation parameter @xmath11 .",
    "further , by supplementing the above dynamics by an additional radiation - reaction force obtained from a pad resummation of the gravitational - wave flux , it allows for the first time the possibility to go beyond the adiabatic approximation and to analytically discuss the transition from inspiral to plunge and the subsequent match to merger and ringing .",
    "the implications of the eob templates for data analysis of binary black holes were explored in @xcite where it was shown that the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is significantly enhanced relative to the usual pn templates due to inclusion of the plunge signal",
    ". the eob formalism does also provide initial dynamical data ( position and momenta ) for two black holes at the beginning of the plunge to be used in numerical relativity to construct gravitational data like metric and its time derivative and evolve einstein s full equations through the merger phase .",
    "the analytical prediction of the eob method ( including spin ) for invariant functions were compared to numerical results based on the helical killing vector approach @xcite for circular orbits of corotating black holes by damour , gourgouhlon and grandclment @xcite and shown to agree remarkably well .",
    "the agreement was robust against choices of resummation of the eob potential and improved with the pn order .",
    "recently , buonanno , chen and vallisneri @xcite made a detailed and exhaustive comparison of all currently available waveforms for non - spinning binary black holes resulting from different approximations .",
    "this study showed ( among other results ) that eob models are more reliable and robust than other non - adiabatic models .",
    "recently blanchet @xcite has made a comparison of the straightforward pn predictions with @xcite and shown that at 3pn order they are as close to the numerical results as the resummed approaches .",
    "while it is indeed interesting to note this closeness of the results derived from one particular non - resummed 3pn function ( the `` energy function '' @xmath12 for circular orbits ) to the numerical results ( and to the eob ones ) , we still do not see any way yet by which , as the hamiltonian @xmath13 does in the eob approach , the bare pn results for the `` circular energy function '' @xmath12 can be used to define templates beyond the adiabatic approximation . as ref .",
    "@xcite has shown the importance of going beyond the adiabatic approximation in describing the smooth transition between the inspiral and the plunge , and as @xcite has shown how significant was the contribution of the plunge to the snr , we consider that the eob waveforms are the best , currently available , analytical templates for binary black hole coalescences .    in this paper , we wish to strain to extremes the flexibility of the eob formalism by tugging it in directions where it can be theoretically pulled and by locating directions it is most likely to yield under deformations by unmodelled effects ( including higher order pn effects )",
    ". we shall introduce seven `` flexibility '' directions i.e.   seven new flexibility parameters .",
    "then we will investigate the `` span '' of the original ( 3pn ) eob templates in the space of waveforms opened up by our extension of the eob waveforms into seven new `` flexibility '' directions . by _",
    "span _ of a given bank of templates , we mean the region of signal space which is well modelled by some template in the bank , i.e.   the set of signals @xmath14 such that the maximized overlap of @xmath14 with _ some _ template @xmath15 is larger than 0.965 .",
    "if the best overlap we can achieve with the true signal is @xmath16 then that distance drops to @xmath17 and the new rate of events would be proportional to @xmath18 in other words , the fractional decrease in the number of events is @xmath19 by demanding that @xmath20 ( i.e. a loss of no more than 10% of all potential events ) we get @xmath21 among our seven flexibility parameters , some like @xmath22 represent higher order ( fourth post - newtonian , 4pn ) corrections in the dynamics , some like @xmath23 , the arbitrariness in the best available 3pn gravitational - wave flux calculation due to incompleteness of the hadamard partie finie regularization , and others like @xmath24 denote a parameter used to factor the gravitational - wave flux in @xcite and accelerate the convergence of the pad approximants to the numerical flux in the test - mass case .",
    "further , the current development of eob has made , at several stages , specific _ choices _ of representation of various physical effects and , as in any analytical construction , the choices were the _",
    "simplest _ that one could apparently make .",
    "we then explored the effects induced by a _ modification _ of these simple choices , i.e.   the consideration of new versions of eob , characterised by different parameter values reflecting other allowed more complex choices .",
    "these comprise the remaining four parameters and include @xmath25(@xmath26 ) a parameter appearing in the effective hamiltonian @xmath27 of the eob , @xmath28 , a parameter to modify the simplest treatment of non - adiabatic effects in the current version of eob templates ; @xmath29 , a parameter to modify the simplest treatment of non - circular effects in the current version of eob templates and finally @xmath30 to allow the possibility that the transition between plunge and ringing may occur at frequencies different from that assumed in the simplest eob model .",
    "the seven parameters @xmath31 , are referred to as the _ flexibility _ parameters .",
    "varying them and testing the change of the physical predictions under reasonable variation of these parameters is a way of probing the overall robustness of the eob framework .",
    "what we specifically investigate is whether a bank of standard 3pn eob templates is sufficient to represent all plausibly relevant extended family of waveforms generated by these new flexibility parameters .    in the context of this investigation our waveforms",
    "will be parameterized by two sets of parameters : ( a ) the first set consists of the usual intrinsic and extrinsic parameters entering the construction of standard waveforms , such as the masses of the component objects and their spins , some reference phase , etc . ,",
    "denoted collectively by @xmath32 @xmath33 in this work we shall only deal with non - spinning point - particles in the _ restricted _ pn approximation @xcite which requires @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting the masses of the two bodies , @xmath36 a reference time ( related to the instant of coalescence ) , and @xmath37 the phase of the wave at the reference time .",
    "( b ) the second set consists of the _ flexibility parameters _ introduced above .",
    "we shall denote these flexibility parameters as @xmath38 @xmath39 with ( @xmath40 ) @xmath41    for studies of the span of a bank of templates of the kind we propose to do in this paper , it is helpful to introduce the notions of a standard or _ fiducial template _ and its associated variant or _ flexed signal _ constructed by turning on one of the flexibility parameters .",
    "the term _ fiducial template _ is used to represent a waveform constructed in a certain approximation and at a given pn order with a fixed set of values of the unknown parameters introduced above . in this paper",
    ", our fiducial template will be the standard eob waveform ( see sec .",
    "[ eobsec ] ) at the 3pn order with the flexibility parameters all set to zero : @xmath42 in contrast , the associated _ flexed signal _ will again be the eob waveform at 3pn order with _ all but one _ of the flexibility parameters @xmath43 set to zero : @xmath44 in other words , in our test of robustness we _ do not allow all the seven parameters to vary simultaneously_. such a variation would lead to a formidably high dimensional parameter space which is computationally impossible to investigate at the moment .",
    "rather , our aim is to study the effect of each flexibility parameter independently and to gauge the extent to which our standard fiducial template waveform can mimic the changes brought about by the flexibility parameters @xmath43 by a mere variation of the intrinsic parameters @xmath45 .",
    "such a systematic study allows us to isolate and identify the most important unknown physical effects , and decide if it is necessary to introduce the corresponding flex parameter as an additional parameter in search templates used in the detection of gravitational waves from black - hole binaries .    as in earlier work ,",
    "our main tool for measuring the span of a bank of templates is the _ overlap _ of a standard fiducial template with a given flexed signal .",
    "( see sec.[sec : overlap ] for the definition of the overlap . ) in this study , we use two measures of `` good overlaps '' : _ faithfulness _ and _ effectualness _ @xcite .",
    "a _ template _",
    "is said to be _",
    "faithful _ if its overlap with a _ flexed signal _ waveform of _ exactly the same intrinsic parameter _",
    "values is larger than 0.965 ( after maximization over the extrinsic parameters ) .",
    "it is expected that faithful templates are also good at estimating source parameters although this is not guaranteed to be the case .",
    "is said to be _ effectual _ if its overlap with a _ flexed signal _ waveform , _ maximized over all the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters _ , is larger than 0.965 .",
    "obviously , every faithful template is necessarily effectual but not all effectual templates are faithful .",
    "note that the notions of faithfulness and effectualness might depend on the particular flexibility direction which is explored : while a template waveform could be faithful with respect to the @xmath46-flexed signal , it might only be effectual with respect to the @xmath47-flexed one and neither with respect to the @xmath48-flexed one .    implementing the above analysis",
    "we conclude that _ the standard 3pn eob templates are effectual with respect to all flexibility parameters _ introduced in this study including the parameter @xmath22 characterising the 4pn dynamical effects . in other words ,",
    "the _ span _ of the bank of 3pn eob templates is large enough to cover the space of signals described by the physically plausible ranges of the seven flexibility parameters considered here .",
    "no additional extra parameters are required in the detection templates to model the more complex choices possible in the eob approach at the 3pn level or the dominant dynamical effects at the 4pn order .",
    "in particular , there is no need to increase the total number of templates beyond the level required for the standard 3pn eob templates .",
    "the conservative dynamics of binary systems in the pn approach has now been determined to 3pn accuracy .",
    "two independent calculations , one based on the canonical adm approach together with the standard hadamard partie finie regularization for the self - field effects @xcite and the second , a direct 3pn iteration of the equations of motion in harmonic coordinates supplemented by an extended hadamard partie finie regularization @xcite agree that the 3pn dynamics and consequently conserved quantities like energy are fully determined except for one arbitrary parameter called @xmath49 in the adm approach and @xmath50 in the harmonic coordinates related by , @xmath51 the hadamard regularization of the self - field of point particles used in @xcite has the serious drawback of violating the gauge symmetry of perturbative general relativity ( diffeomorphism invariance ) , and thereby of breaking the crucial link between bianchi identities and equations of motion .",
    "this explains why the hadamard - based works @xcite were unable to fix the parameter @xmath49 .",
    "recently , damour , jaranowski and schfer @xcite have proposed to use a better regularization scheme , one which respects the gauge symmetry of perturbative general relativity : _ dimensional regularization_. they have implemented this improved regularization scheme , which led them to a unique determination @xcite of the parameter @xmath49 , namely @xmath52 , corresponding to @xmath53 . thus the conservative dynamics is completely determined to 3pn order within the adm approach using dimensional regularization . though it will be interesting to reconfirm the value of @xmath50 by other treatments",
    ", we believe that the result of @xcite is trustable especially in view of the obtention there , by the same regularization method , of the unique poincar - invariant momentum - dependent part of the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , for all applications including data analysis , there is no arbitrariness in 3pn dynamics , and consistent with this , in this paper we set @xmath52 or equivalently @xmath53 .",
    "on the other hand , the gravitational - wave energy flux from binary systems has been computed using the multipolar post - minkowskian approach @xcite in harmonic coordinates and hadamard regularization to 3.5pn accuracy . unlike at earlier orders @xcite the instantaneous and hereditary contributions",
    "do not remain isolated . at 3pn order , in addition to the instantaneous terms",
    ", the tails - of - tails and tail - squared terms also contribute .",
    "fortunately , they have been computed by blanchet @xcite who has also computed the tail contribution at 3.5pn order .",
    "the gravitational wave energy flux contains the 3pn - accurate time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment leading to a specific @xmath50 dependence which as explained earlier is now known since @xmath49 is computed",
    ". however , the incompleteness of the hadamard regularization introduces additional arbitrary parameters in the mass quadrupole moment leading to three new undetermined parameters that combined into the unique quantity @xmath23 in the circular energy flux .",
    "unfortunately , up to now no alternate regularization or calculations without regularizations exist that provide the value of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , one has to reckon with this arbitrary parameter in the templates that one constructs and the best one can do is estimate its implications for data analysis of inspiraling compact binaries as in @xcite or in the present work .",
    "the expression for the 3pn energy function @xcite and 3.5pn flux function @xcite and the resulting 3pn and 3.5pn coefficients in various phasing formulas discussed in @xcite are summarised in @xcite .",
    "though they are the basis of the present analysis , they are not reproduced here for reasons of brevity and we refer the reader to @xcite for those expressions .    in this work , we have used the 3pn - accurate flux function because the standard near - diagonal pad of the 3.5pn flux function involves a spurious pole in the physically relevant range of variation of @xmath54 . we leave to future work an investigation of alternative pad s of the 3.5pn flux free of such spurious poles . in view of the numerical smallness of the 3.5pn contribution to the flux , we expect no significant change in our physical conclusions .",
    "the starting motivation of the eob approach is to try to capture in a small number of numerical coefficients the essential invariant pn contributions from among the plethora of terms that exist in the complete pn expansion of the binary s equations of motion , in the belief that many of these terms are gauge artefacts and hence irrelevant .",
    "it is also strongly motivated by the need to look for an analytic route to go beyond the adiabatic approximation which breaks down before the last stable orbit .",
    "we recall that the standard pn treatments based on invariant functions @xmath55 are limited by the adiabatic approximation ( and can not describe the transition to plunge ) , while the treatments based on the direct use of ( non - resummed ) pn - expanded equations of motion are unreliable @xcite because of poor convergence of the straightforward pn - expanded equations of motion .",
    "as shown in @xcite , at 2pn order the mapping to eob is eventually unique ( when imposing some general requirement ) .",
    "the waveform , the equations governing the evolution of the orbital phase and the initial conditions to integrate them through the plunge are discussed in @xcite and were used in @xcite to construct 2pn eob templates and investigate their performance . at 3pn order , on the other hand , the situation is more involved .",
    "when requiring that the relative motion be equivalent to geodesic motion in some effective metric , there are more constraints than free parameters in the energy map and effective metric .",
    "this led @xcite to an extension of the 2pn eob construction ( non - geodesic motion ) involving a larger variety of choices . in ref .",

    "the ultimate tool for testing the robustness is of course the overlap of template waveforms with flexed waveforms . given a fiducial template @xmath303 and a flexed signal @xmath304 their overlap @xmath305 is defined as @xmath306 where the scalar product is defined as usual by the wiener formula @xmath307 .",

    "@xcite given by : @xmath314{\\rm hz}^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath315  hz . since the noise curve rises very steeply at low frequencies the lower limit of the integral in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : scalarproduct ] ) does not have to be zero .",
    "it suffices to choose a lower limit of 40  hz so as not to lose more than 1% of the overlap for binaries with total mass @xmath316    _ faithfulness _",
    "@xmath317 is defined as the overlap maximized only over the extrinsic parameters of the template , which in our case are simply a reference time @xmath318 at which the template waveform reaches a certain frequency ( say 40  hz ) and the phase @xmath319 of the signal at that time : @xmath320    _ effectualness _",
    "@xmath321 is defined as the overlap maximized over not only the extrinsic parameters but all the intrinsic parameters as well , which in our case are the two masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the binary : @xmath322      in searching for signals of known shape , such as chirping radiation from black hole binaries , one employs the method of matched filtering . for signals of known pattern , matched filtering",
    "is , in gaussian noise background , a statistically optimum strategy in which a data analyst computes the cross - correlation of the template waveform @xmath323 with the detector output @xmath324 the analyst will not know before hand when the signal arrives or what its parameters are .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to take several copies of the template corresponding to different parameter values @xmath45 and compute the correlation of each of those templates with the detector output at different time - steps @xmath325 . if detector output contains a sufficiently strong signal resembling one of the template waveforms then the cross - correlation will exceed the rms value of the correlation by a large amount , thereby generating a trigger for the analyst .",
    "it is well - known that the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath326 of a template @xmath15 with the detector output that contains a signal @xmath14 of known shape is given by @xmath327 here @xmath328 is the signal - to - noise ratio which would be achievable by matched filtering if the detector output were correlated with the exact replica of the signal hidden in the noise modulo the amplitude which is irrelevant .",
    "the above equation tells us that when we do not know the exact shape of the signal , the signal - to - noise ratio gets degraded and only a fraction equal to the overlap of the template used in the search with the exact signal expected to be present in the detector output is what is recoverable .",
    "thus , while matched filtering is an excellent technique in detecting signals buried in noise , dephasing of the template relative to the signal can quickly degrade the quality of the output .",
    "this can be readily seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalarproduct ] ) where the fourier _ amplitudes _ of the template and the signal are multiplied together before being integrated over the frequency .",
    "these amplitudes coherently add up only when the phase of the template coincides with that of the signal at all points in the frequency space .",
    "even a small initial difference in phase can accumulate and kill the integral since the signals last for a large number of cycles  more than 60 cycles for @xmath329,@xmath330 black hole binaries and up to 1000 for ns - ns binaries in the sensitivity band of the ligo interferometers .",
    "this is the motivation for building template waveforms that are as close to the true general relativistic signal as possible .",
    "note , however , that the weighting of the overlap integral eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalarproduct ] ) by the inverse of the noise spectral density means that not all cycles in the signal and the template , are equally important .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of `` useful cycles '' as a measure of the effective number of cycles which dominate the overlap integral .",
    "for instance in the case of a @xmath275 system the number of useful cycles is @xmath331 .",
    "this means that it is crucial to model the phasing of the signal during the @xmath332 cycles around the peak of the snr logarithmic frequency - distribution i.e.  around @xmath333hz , but that a less accurate model of phasing for the other cycles may be acceptable .",
    "stringent as it may sound , matched filtering is not totally restrictive when dealing with a template bank rather than a single template . to explain how a template bank is not as restrictive as a single template we introduce the notion of _ span of a template bank .",
    "_ in the geometrical language of signal analysis @xcite templates can be thought of as vectors ",
    "one vector for every set of values of the parameters @xmath334 if the signal depends on @xmath335 parameters then the set of all vectors run over a @xmath335-dimensional manifold . equation ( [ eq : scalarproduct ] ) serves as a scalar product between different vectors and induces a natural metric @xmath336 on the template - manifold with the parameters serving as natural coordinates : @xmath337 though each template is itself a vector in the vector space of all detector outputs , the set of all templates do not form a vector space .",
    "therefore , when dealing with the problem of constructing a bank of templates one is really working with only a subspace of the vector space .",
    "moreover , one does not work with the full template space either but , like in quantum mechanics , with the set of _",
    "rays _ , i.e. the set of vectors modulo their lengths , which can be realized as the set of _ normalized _ vectors .",
    "in other words , we work on the unit sphere in the initial vector space . when considering a submanifold on this sphere which is _ not _ the intersection of a linear space with the unit sphere the metric @xmath336 gives only a local approximation to the vector product of the larger space , but it does not endow the finite - dimensional submanifold with the correct projection of the metric structure of the larger space .    in our search for gravitational - wave signals",
    "we choose a grid of templates on the template - manifold .",
    "if the templates are an exact replica of the expected signal then the density of the grid points is so chosen that no signal vector on the manifold has an overlap with the `` nearest '' grid point smaller than a certain fraction called the _ minimal match _ mm @xcite , typically chosen to be either @xmath338 or possibly @xmath339 : @xmath340    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : max range ]",
    "in this study we have explored the robustness of 3pn eob templates .",
    "we introduced seven flexibility parameters that affect the two - body dynamics and radiation emission and varied each of them separately over a range that can be reasonably considered to be large enough to encompass unknown and unmodelled pn effects .",
    "the parameters introduced are : ( a ) a 4pn parameter @xmath22 that alters the two - body effective metric and the eob potential @xmath118 .",
    "we conducted a special study of the structure of 4pn contributions to the hamiltonian to estimate the plausible range of the parameter @xmath22 measuring them ( @xmath341 ) .",
    "( b ) the unknown 3pn parameter @xmath23 affecting the nature of the energy flux emitted by the system ( @xmath342 ) .",
    "( c ) a parameter @xmath26 that changes @xmath343 terms in the two - body hamiltonian ( @xmath344 ) .",
    "( d ) location of the pole in the energy flux controlled by a parameter @xmath24 .",
    "( e ) and three parameters @xmath249 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , that are varied so as to inflict at least a factor two change in the modelling of non - adiabatic effects , non - circular effects and the transition from inspiral to plunge , respectively .",
    "we then compared the faithfulness and effectualness of standard fiducial eob templates ( that is , eob templates in which all the above parameters are set equal to zero ) with the flexed signals obtained by switching on the flexibility parameters one at a time .",
    "based on the study conducted in this work we find that the third post - newtonian eob templates lead to effectualness larger than 96.3% in all cases ( when @xmath345 ) . for the @xmath275 systems , and @xmath22 larger than 190",
    "the effectualness drops below the usual requirement @xmath346 , though it remains very close to it , being larger than 0.96 .",
    "( even when @xmath22 gets very large the effectualness never drops below 0.95 . )",
    "there are two ways of improving this situation linked to the special sensitivity to @xmath22 .",
    "one way is to augument the standard 3pn bank of templates [ based on @xmath347 by ( when it is needed ) a second bank of templates , based on @xmath348 .",
    "we have checked that this `` doubled '' bank of templates allows one to span all values of @xmath22 with overlaps better than 0.985 .",
    "a second way ( which minimizes the total number of templates needed ) is to work in all cases with only one specific @xmath22-flexed bank of templates [ namely the one based on the `` intermediate '' eob potential @xmath349 .",
    "the remarkable agreement between numerical and analytical descriptions of circular orbits near the lso @xcite , suggests that it might be possible soon to use numerical simulations to map in detail the eob potential @xmath118 near the lso .",
    "hopefully this might lead to a numerical estimate of the value of @xmath22 thereby sharpening the preferred choice of bank of templates .",
    "there is a caveat in the current evaluation which we must bear in mind namely that we vary the flexibility parameters only one at a time .",
    "it is possible that the actual physical signal has more than one of the flexibility parameters non - zero . in that case",
    "our fiducial templates might not be able to achieve the desired span .",
    "this is because the ` shifts ' in the fiducial template parameters needed to separately correct for the various non - zero flexibility parameters might be in different ` directions ' .",
    "an attempt to define a rather phenomenological signal was the main focus of ref . @xcite . in this paper , we have focussed on a different ( minimalistic ) attitude and have not looked into these matters .",
    "we intend to address this issue in a future work .    to conclude : the 3pn eob templates ( possibly suitably @xmath22-flexed ) are good models to use for black hole binary searches in the interferometer gravitational - wave data because their `` span '' in signal space seems large enough to encompass most of the plausible modifications one can think of making in the current eob framework .",
    "moreover , as we emphasized , the highly elongated shape of overlap contours in the @xmath350-plane suggests the interesting possibility to drastically reduce the number of eob templates by using a small number of universal phasing functions @xmath351 with a small discrete set of values of @xmath11 prominently including @xmath217 .",
