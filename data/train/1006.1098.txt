    "the effect of vacuum particle creation in a strong electric field was predicted long ago @xcite but is not confirmed experimentally up to now",
    ". theoretical research on this effect in the framework of kinetic theory @xcite has shown the existence of a quasiparticle plasma of high density already in subcritical electric fields @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "such a quasiparticle plasma does not survive after switching off the external field in contrast to the real ( observed ) plasma that remains after applying the pulse of a strong field @xmath3 @xcite , see also @xcite for the case @xmath4 .",

    "one of these effects is based on the possibility of one - photon and two - photon annihilation of the quasiparticle pairs .",

    "this stimulates the development of more adequate methods such as a kinetic description of the epp , taking into account also its photon component .",
    "the first steps in the direction of including the photon sector of the epp into the kinetic description were done in the works @xcite .    in present work we develop the kinetic theory of the epp photon sector on the basis of the one - photon annihilation process which is no longer forbidden in the presence of strong fields @xcite .",
    "this requires a derivation of the second level equations of the bbgky chain . in the case of an oscillating electric field",
    "we show that the photon production rate is determined by joint action of ponderomotive forces and multi - photon processes .",
    "the spectrum of the annihilation photons has the @xmath0 behaviour of flicker noise .",
    "this effect is very small for optical excitations of the epp but can reach quite observable values in the @xmath1 - ray region .",
    "we calculate the intensity of such processes on the basis of the `` photon count method '' @xcite .",
    "we have the methodical basis for more advanced calculations of the photon production rate for the two - photon annihilation mechanism requiring the fourth level equations of the bbgky chain .",
    "let us stress that the present estimates are actual especially in view of the planned experiment for testing the subcritical epp production in vacuum with the astra - gemini high power laser @xcite .",
    "an external electric field generates a vacuum instability due to epp creation accompanied by the appearance of internal currents and electromagnetic fields ( backreaction problem ) .",
