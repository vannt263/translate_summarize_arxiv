    "chandra _ for pwne around the crab pulsar ( hester et al .",
    "2002 ) , vela pulsar ( helfand et al . 2001 ; pavlov et al .",
    "2001 ) , and psr b150958 ( gaensler et al.2002 ) have shown approximately axially - symmetric pwn morphologies , with an extended jet - like structures stretched along the symmetry axis .",
    "this suggests that the jets are common to at least young pulsars and are not limited to accreting systems ( e.g. , agns , microquasars ) .",
    "most likely , pulsar jets are associated with collimated outflows of relativistic particles along the pulsar s rotation axes .    due to its proximity ( @xmath15 pc ;",
    "caraveo et al .",
    "2001 ) , the vela pwn is particularly well suited for studying the pulsar outflows .",
    "we carried out a series of eight monitoring observations with the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "these observations have confirmed the dynamical structure of the pwn ( pavlov et al .",
    "2001 ) , with most dramatic changes occurring in the outer jet .",
    "moreover , we were able to detect an `` outer counter - jet '' , a much dimmer extension of the southeast ( counter-)jet . here",
    ", we focus on the highly variable outer jet , which has been detected in ten acis observations ( carried out from 2000 april 30 through 2002 august 6 ) and three observations with the high resolution camera ( hrc ) .",
    "the large - scale x - ray structure of the vela pwn is shown in the summed image composed of the last eight acis observations ( upper left panel of fig.1 ; see pavlov et al .",
    "2002 for technical details of the observations , image reduction and co - alignment ) .",
    "this deep image clearly reveals a long outer jet [ 7 ] , approximately in the direction of the proper motion ( pa @xmath16 ; caraveo et al .",
    "the outer jet extends for @xmath17 pc away from the pulsar , where @xmath18 is the distance to the pulsar in units of 300 pc .",
    "the characteristic width ( diameter ) of the outer jet is about @xmath19 cm . a much fainter outer counter - jet [ 8 ] is seen in the opposite direction . also , we see extended diffuse emission [ 9 ] southwest of the jet / counter - jet line , which is obviously connected to the `` main body '' of the pwn .",
    "the inner pwn with the pulsar [ 1 ] at its center consists of the inner arc [ 2 ] , the outer arc [ 3 ] , the inner jet [ 4 ] , and the inner counter - jet [ 5 ] .",
    "the inner jet is directed northwest from the pulsar in the direction of the pulsar s proper motion , and the counter - jet is directed toward the southeast ( pa @xmath20 ) .",
    "the bright pwn core ( white in fig .",
    "1 ) is surrounded by a `` shell '' [ 6 ] of diffuse emission .",
    "the outer jet looks like an extension of the much brighter inner jet , well beyond the apparent termination point of the inner jet at its intersection with the outer arc .",
    "finally , figure 1 demonstrates that the outer jet preferentially bends to the south - west of the jet / counter - jet line and apparently connects to the extended diffuse emission region ( fig .",
    "1 ; upper left panel ) .",
    "figure 1 also presents the time sequence of the 3 and hrc - i observations for the outer jet .",
    "the variability of the outer jet is clearly seen , in both the hrc and acis images . over the thirteen observations , with different periods of time between each of them , we distinguish three different types of variability .",
    "first , the outer jet shifts from side to side , bending and apparently twisting . second , the blobs move outward along the outer jet .",
    "finally , the blobs change in brightness and eventually disappear .",
    "the most dramatic variations we see are the large - scale bends of the jet ( e.g. compare observations 1 , 2 , 3 and 13 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the short time ( 16 days ) between the fifth and eighth observations suggests that this bending occurs on a time scale of order of weeks .",
    "the small - scale changes are seen in all of the observations .",
    "for instance , the `` base '' of the outer jet ( where it leaves the shell  see the white boxes in fig .  1 in upper right and bottom panels )",
    "shifts from one observation to the next .",
    "typical apparent speeds of these shifts are of order a few tenths of speed of light . the apparent speeds of blobs a and b are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "blob c vanished quickly , having an ( unconstrained ) apparent speed of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the observed variations suggest typical bulk flow velocities of 0.30.7 of the speed of light .",
    "the outer jet is , on average , a factor of 7 brighter than the outer counter - jet .",
    "if the outer jet and outer counter - jet are intrinsically similar but streaming along a straight line ( on average ) in opposite directions , then the difference in brightness means that the outer jet is approaching at an angle of @xmath24@xmath25 to the line - of sight while the outer counter - jet is receding .",
    "such an orientation contradicts to the previously suggested models of the inner jets and the bright arcs ( e.g. helfand et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we see thet the width of the outer jet , @xmath26 cm , remains approximately the same along the jet in all observations .",
    "this suggests an efficient confinement mechanism , perhaps associated with magnetic fields generated by electric currents in the pinched jet .",
    "the current required , @xmath27 , is an order of magnitude lower than the goldreich - julian current in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the bright blobs and strong bends could be caused by the sausage and kink instabilities , respectively , in such a pinched jet .",
    "the spectrum of the outer jet fits well with a power law model ( @xmath4 ) suggesting the synchrotron emission .",
    "the outer counter - jet also exhibits power - law spectrum with @xmath141.5 . outside the bright pwn",
    ", there is an asymmetric , dim outer diffuse nebula that is substantially brighter southwest of the jet / counter - jet line .",
    "its spectrum ( @xmath28 ) is softer than that of the outer jet , but it is harder than the spectrum of the brighter pwn shell ( @xmath29 ; region [ 6 ] in upper left panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the x - ray emitting particles in the dim nebula are supplied through the outer jet ."
