    "phase coherence of electron motion is an important issue in mesoscopic physics . indeed",
    ", preserving coherence of the conduction electrons is an essential requirement for the correct working of mesoscopic semiconductor devices relying on quantum mechanical phenomena @xcite .",
    "a well - known example of such systems is the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) ring @xcite .",
    "its features are due to the the phase difference acquired by the electrons passing on the upper and lower arms of the ring in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this gives rise to the well known interference pattern in the electron transmission as a function of the magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "scattering by magnetic impurities , and more in general by systems with an internal spin degree of freedom , is a well - known source of electron decoherence @xcite .",
    "this follows from the uncertainty in the phase shift acquired by the scattered electron @xcite .",
    "equivalently , decoherence can be viewed as due to the unavoidable scattering induced entanglement between the electron and impurity degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the transmission properties of an ab ring with a single magnetic impurity inserted in one of the arms and with the electron and impurity spins interacting via a contact exchange coupling has been analyzed in @xcite . when no spin - flip occurs ",
    "i.e. when the electron and impurity spins are initially aligned  the case of a static impurity is recovered @xcite and the amplitude of ab oscillations with no impurity is preserved in a wide range of values of the exchange coupling constant centered around zero @xcite .",
    "however when spin - flip occurs , e.g. when the two spins are initially anti - aligned , the amplitude of ab oscillations is reduced .",
    "this is a signature of a loss of electron coherence which is larger for increasing strengths of the electron - impurity coupling constant @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider an ab ring with two identical spin-1/2 magnetic impurities , one embedded in each arm .",
    "such system is not a mere academic extension of an ab ring with a single impurity but shows new phenomena .",
    "a new feature that appears in the presence of two spins is multiple scattering between the two impurities with simultaneous occurrence of spin - flip events .",
    "this leads to new cooperative phenomena .",
    "for instance , in the case of a 1d wire we have found that , under suitable resonance conditions , perfect transparency appears when the the two impurity spins are initially prepared in the singlet maximally entangled state @xcite . in the present paper we will focus on the effects of entanglement between the impurity spins on the ab oscillations .",
    "our main result is that , for suitable electron wave vectors , the amplitude of ab oscillations turns out to be in fact not reduced in a wide range of values of the coupling constant when the impurity spins are prepared in the maximally entangled singlet state @xmath0 .",
    "this coherent transmission is due to an effective suppression of spin - flip events which occurs regardless of the electron spin state , at variance with the no spin - flip case which occurs when the electron and impurity spins are aligned @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secapproach ] we introduce our system and illustrate the approach used to derive the exact transmission probability amplitudes . in sec .",
    "[ ab ] we investigate the ab oscillations for different spin states showing how a nearly coherent behavior is exhibited for the singlet state of the impurity spins . in sec .",
    "[ generation ] we propose a scheme for generating this maximally entangled state via electron scattering . the detailed mathematical derivation of all the transmission probability amplitudes is provided in appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "as illustrated in fig . [ ring ] ,",
    "our system consists of a conducting ring with equal arms .",
    "the circumference length is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "we assume the width of the structure to be narrow enough to let only the lowest electron subband to be accounted for .",
    "the effective mass of the electron is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "two identical spin-1/2 impurities , labeled 1 and 2 , are centered in the upper and lower arm , respectively ( see fig .",
    "the left and right junctions of the ring are denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "a static magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the ring plane across the internal region , excluding the wire and thus the two impurities ( see gray shaded region in fig .",
    "1 ) .    as in refs . @xcite , we adopt a quantum waveguide theory approach here properly generalized to take into account the presence of the two magnetic impurities .",
    "the local coordinate along the electron - current direction @xcite on the upper ( lower ) arm is denoted as @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "both the above coordinates point to the junction @xmath4 with their origins being taken at @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hamiltonian in the absence of impurities and @xmath11 ( @xmath8 ) describes the coupling between the electron spin @xmath12 and the spin-1/2 of the @xmath13-th impurity @xmath14 . denoting by @xmath15 the vector potential of the magnetic field @xmath16 and by @xmath17 the electron momentum operator , @xmath10 has the well - known form @xmath18 as the vector potential is along the ring direction and has magnitude @xmath19 , with @xmath20 standing for the magnetic flux through the ring section area , the effective representation @xmath21 of ( [ h0 ] ) in the @xmath13-th arm is explicitly written as @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) for @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we model the electron - impurity spin - spin coupling as a contact exchange interaction according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the coupling constant , @xmath29 is the coordinate of the @xmath13-th impurity and where all the spin operators are in units of @xmath30 . at each electron - impurity scattering event",
    "no energy exchange takes place .",
    "however , the spin state of the two systems will , in general , change . in particular , if the electron and impurity spins are initially anti - aligned spin - flip may occur .",
    "it is useful to rewrite the electron - impurity coupling hamiltonian ( [ hei ] ) in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total spin of the electron and the @xmath33th impurity . denoting by @xmath34 the total spin operator , it turns out that @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with quantum numbers @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , are constants of motion .",
    "it is thus convenient to use as spin space basis the states @xmath39 , common eigenstates of @xmath40 ( quantum number @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 and @xmath36 @xcite ( from now on , the subscript @xmath37 in @xmath43 will be omitted ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath44 the transmission probability amplitude that an electron injected from the left lead with wave vector @xmath45 and initial spin state @xmath46 is transmitted in the right lead in the spin state @xmath39 .",
    "note that , due to the form ( [ hei2 ] ) of @xmath11 , the amplitudes @xmath44 do not depend on @xmath47 , as it will be made clearer in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath44 can be exactly calculated by deriving the stationary states of the electron - two impurities system . due to the conservation of @xmath35 and @xmath36 ,",
    "their calculation can be carried on separately in each subspace of fixed @xmath37 and @xmath47 .",
    "note that , since @xmath48 ( quantum number @xmath49 ) and @xmath40 do not commute , @xmath40 is generally not conserved .",
    "since we are coupling three spins 1/2 , it turns out that the possible values of @xmath37 are 1/2 and 3/2 . when @xmath50 the possible values of @xmath41 are @xmath51 , while for @xmath52 we have @xmath53 ( @xmath49 can assume the same values ) .",
    "for left - incoming electrons with wave vector @xmath45 there are eight stationary states and each of them can be expressed as an 8-dimensional column denoted as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ; @xmath57 ) is a labeling index which generally differs from @xmath41 .",
    "note that since @xmath58 for @xmath52 , in the subspace @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath40 effectively commute and thus no spin - flip can occur : the impurities behave as being static .",
    "this is not true for the subspace @xmath50 , for which @xmath49 and @xmath41 can take values @xmath59 .",
    "therefore spin - flip in general takes place in the subspace @xmath50 .",
    "the knowledge of all coefficients @xmath60 , whose detailed calculation is carried on in appendix [ appendix ] , completely describes the transmission properties of our system .",
    "here we are mainly interested in calculating how an electron with a given wave vector @xmath45 and for some initial electron - impurities spin state @xmath61 is transmitted through the device . thus assuming to have the incident wave @xmath62 , with @xmath61 being an arbitrary spin state , it is straightforward to see that @xmath62 is the incoming part of the stationary state @xmath63 it follows that the transmitted part @xmath64 of ( [ sviluppochi ] ) provides the transmitted state into which @xmath62 evolves after its passage through the ring . to calculate @xmath64 we simply replace each stationary state @xmath65 in ( [ sviluppochi ] ) with its transmitted part , express the latter in terms of amplitudes @xmath66 and rearrange ( [ sviluppochi ] ) as a linear expansion in the basis @xmath67 .",
    "this yields @xcite @xmath68 with @xmath69 coefficients ( [ alpha_coeff ] ) fully describe how an incoming wave @xmath62 is transmitted through the mesoscopic ring .",
    "for instance , the total electron transmission coefficient @xmath70 can be calculated as @xmath71    in appendix [ appendix ] , we derive all the coefficients @xmath44 through the calculation of the stationary states @xmath54 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath44 turn out to depend on the dimensionless parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the flux quantum . in fig .",
    "[ ring ] we plot the ab oscillations of electron transmission @xmath70 for @xmath76 ( in unity of @xmath77 ) and @xmath78 for an incoming electron in the state @xmath79 and the impurity spins in the initial product states @xmath80 ( a ) and @xmath81 ( b ) . in the first case , the amplitude of ab oscillations is negligibly reduced by an increase of @xmath82 in line with the no - spin flip scattering case for one magnetic impurity @xcite .",
    "indeed , when the state @xmath80 is prepared no spin - flip takes place since all the electron and impurity spins are aligned and the overall state @xmath83 belongs to the subspace @xmath52 where impurities behave as being static ( see sec . [ secapproach ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of a ring with two static impurities @xcite is thus recovered . on the contrary , in the case @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "2b ) the amplitude of ab oscillations is rapidly reduced for increasing values of @xmath82 similarly to the spin - flip scattering case of ref .",
    "indeed , the initial overall spin state @xmath84 - which has non vanishing projection both on subspace @xmath52 and on the @xmath50 one - is generally changed by electron - impurities scattering into a linear combination of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 indicating occurrence of spin - flip events .",
    "this induces loss of coherence as witnessed by the reduction of ab oscillations with @xmath82 .",
    "denoting by @xmath87 the probability that the initial spin state of the electron - impurities system is transmitted unchanged @xcite , we define the coefficient @xmath88 such that @xmath89 . since for @xmath90 @xmath91 it turns out that @xmath92 provides information of occurrence of spin - flip or not : high values of @xmath92 correspond to low probability of spin - flip events . for instance , in the case of fig .",
    "2a @xmath93 for any value of @xmath20 and @xmath82 since spin - flip does not take place at all . in fig .",
    "[ eta]a @xmath92 is plotted as a function of @xmath94 for @xmath76 and for the initial state @xmath84 .",
    "as @xmath82 is increased , the minimum value of @xmath92 gets lower and lower due to higher chance for spin - flip to occur .",
    "we now investigate electron transmission when the impurity spins are initially in a maximally entangled state . here",
    "we focus on the maximally entangled triplet and singlet states @xmath95 . considering an incoming electron in the state @xmath79 , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the behaviour of @xmath70 for @xmath96 ( a ) and @xmath97 ( b ) .    in the case of @xmath98 a behaviour similar to fig .",
    "2b with reduction of the amplitude of ab oscillations , signature of the presence of decoherence , appears .",
    "this is confirmed by an analysis of @xmath92 under the same conditions ( fig .",
    "[ eta]b ) showing occurrence of spin - flip .",
    "however , a striking behaviour is observed for the singlet state @xmath0 . despite the fact that the spin state @xmath99 fully lies in the subspace @xmath50 ( where spin - flip may occur )",
    "the oscillations amplitude is negligibly reduced for the considered strengths of @xmath82 , resembling qualitatively the coherent behaviour of fig .",
    "indeed , as showed in fig .",
    "[ eta]c , @xmath93 in this case . an effective suppression of spin - flip and decoherence thus takes place provided the impurity spins are in the state @xmath0 . unlike the no spin - flip case of fig .",
    "[ fig2]a requiring alignment of the electron and impurity spins , our calculations show that , as it will be made clearer later , the present behavior is exhibited regardless of the spin state of the incoming electron .",
    "no constraint on the spin polarization of the incident electron is thus required for this phenomenon to occur .",
    "the amplitude of ab oscillations for a fixed strength of @xmath82 can be calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum of @xmath70 over the interval @xmath100 . in fig .",
    "5 we plot this amplitude as a function of @xmath82 for @xmath78 and for the initial spin states @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath101 and @xmath99 . as pointed out previously , in the case of @xmath83 the problem reduces to a potential scattering with two static impurities and there exists a finite range of values of @xmath82 centered at @xmath102 where the amplitude is not reduced @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath84 and @xmath101 for which the amplitude never equals 1 even at small @xmath82 and gets smaller and smaller for increasing strengths of @xmath82 .",
    "similarly to the no - spin flip case @xmath83 , for @xmath99 there is a finite range around @xmath102 showing negligible amplitude reduction .    to quantify the above finite range",
    ", we introduce the quantity @xmath103 , defined as the width of the interval around @xmath104 where the amplitude of ab oscillation for a given initial spin state is larger than @xmath105 . to further illustrate how the electron transmission through the ring depends on the state in which the two impurities are prepared let us consider the family of one spin up impurity spins states @xmath106 with @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "this family includes both maximally entangled and product states . in fig .",
    "[ teta_phi ] we plot @xmath103 as a function of @xmath109 and @xmath110 when the electron is injected in the spin state @xmath79 and the impurities are prepared in a state ( [ family ] ) for @xmath111 .",

    "note how the width of the range showing a nearly coherent behaviour depends crucially on the relative phase @xmath110 between the impurity spin states @xmath81 and @xmath113 .",
    "four sharp maxima of @xmath103 appear in correspondence to the impurity spins prepared in the singlet state @xmath97 .",
    "these results suggests that @xmath110 can be regarded as a sort of control parameter of electron coherence in a mesoscopic ring with two spin 1/2 impurities .",
    "such behavior can be explained in terms of an effective quasi - conservation of @xmath114 , where @xmath115 denotes the total spin of the two impurities .",
    "this observable have quantum number @xmath116 , corresponding to the singlet and triplet subspaces , respectively .",
    "according to such quasi - conservation , whose origin we will explain shortly , and taking into account the fact that @xmath117 is a constant of motion , the initial spin state @xmath101 is scattered into a linear combination of @xmath101 and @xmath86 . however , since the eigenspace @xmath118 , @xmath119 is non degenerate , the initial spin state @xmath99 is transmitted or reflected nearly unchanged , as shown fig .",

    "a maximum value not larger than 1@xmath125 is reached .",
    "the origin of quasi - conservation of @xmath114 can be explained as follows .",
    "the wavefunction in the upper arm of the ring is a linear combination of @xmath126 and @xmath127 , while in the lower one it is linear combination of @xmath128 and @xmath129 with @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) .",

    "[ eta]c @xmath91 for @xmath134 ) , while @xmath101 can only either remain unchanged or be flipped into @xmath86 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] @xmath135 exactly vanishes for @xmath134 ) . in the presence of a flux @xmath20 ,",
    "the above symmetry is broken and perfect conservation of @xmath114 generally does not occur . however , even for @xmath136 as @xmath72 approaches @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) the symmetry still holds .",
    "indeed , the boundary conditions at the ring junctions and those at the two impurities positions imply that the stationary states of the system depend on @xmath72 through phase factors of the form @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "it is thus straightforward to see that , for each stationary state , the squared modulus of the wave function is a periodic function of @xmath72 with period @xmath141 , this meaning that for @xmath142 with @xmath143 the transmission properties of the ring coincide with those obtained for @xmath144 . in the regime",
    "@xmath142 the system thus behaves as if @xmath145 and the two arms turn out to be symmetric . to illustrate this , in fig .",

    "in this section we mainly address the issue of how to generate the maximally entangled state @xmath0 of the two impurity spins giving rise to the above described effects .",
    "possible implementations of a magnetic impurity in the single - channel ring are a paramagnetic impurity atom having a virtual state in the continuum @xcite or a quantum dot with one excess unpaired electron and thus behaving as an effective spin 1/2 system @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a method for entangling the two impurities via electron scattering with an entanglement mediator .",
    "generation of entangled states of two magnetic impurities via electron scattering in 1-dimensional systems has been recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of these schemes is to send an electron in the up spin state @xmath79 with the two impurity spins initially in a product state @xmath153 .",
    "the impurities are so far apart that their mutual coupling is negligible .",

    "@xmath36 is conserved in the scattering process and the transmitted spin state will result in a linear combination of @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath120 .",
    "if the transmitted electron is filtered in the down spin state @xmath156 , the two impurities are generally left in an entangled state .",
    "this state is not necessarily maximally entangled @xcite .",
