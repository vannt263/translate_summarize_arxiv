    "it is a well known result that a countable group admits a left ( or right)-invariant total order if and only if it acts faithfully by orientation preserving homeomorphisms on @xmath0 ( see theorem 6.8 of @xcite for a proof ) .",
    "many groups that arise naturally in topology are left - orderable , for example artin groups , certain mapping class groups of riemann surfaces , and many 3-manifold groups .",
    "boyer , rolfsen and wiest establish in @xcite that there are compact connected manifolds modelled on each of the eight 3-dimensional geometries with both orderable and nonorderable fundamental groups .",
    "the first examples of non - orderable hyperbolic 3-manifold groups are given in @xcite , and the non - orderability of these groups is established by showing that they can not act via faithful orientation preserving homeomorphisms on @xmath0 .",
    "now , @xmath0 is a special case of a simply connected 1-manifold , and in fact the paper shows that these groups can not act nontrivially on any oriented simply connected 1-manifold .",
    "furthermore , the points of oriented simply - connected 1-manifolds have a natural order , just as the points of @xmath0 do .",
    "in contrast to the total order of the points on the real line , the points of these more general manifolds are in general only partially ordered ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to characterize the left invariant partial orders on groups that correspond to group actions on oriented simply - connected 1-manifolds , and their generalizations , oriented order trees , and to prove the analogue of the classical theorem relating left orderability of groups and faithful group actions on @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall some of the relevant background information on simply connected 1-manifolds and their generalizations , order trees .",
    "we also extend some basic ideas about ends from hausdorff trees to the more general setting of order trees . in section 3",
    ", we define the abstract partial orders we will be concerned with , which we call partial orders with rectifiable simply connected extensions ( see definitions  [ simplyconnected ]  ( simply connected posets ) ,  [ d : extension ]  ( extensions ) , and  [ d : finiteswitches ]  ( rectifiable ) ) .",
    "we establish certain properties of sets equipped with such partial orders , which allow us to define a notion of  betweenness \" ( see definition  [ d : betweenness ] ) for arbitrary simply connected posets that agrees with the natural notion of  between \" for 1-manifolds .",
    "we also show that these orders naturally pass to both subgroups and quotient groups ( see theorem  [ t : quotientgetsorder ] ) . in section 4",
    "we use the partial order and its betweenness relation to show by construction that groups that admit left invariant partial orders with rectifiable simply connected extensions act on simply connected 1-manifolds by orientation preserving homeomorphisms ( see theorem  [ t : order.to.action ] ) . in section 5 , we show in theorems [ t : arbitrarytree ] and [ t : weakstab ] that groups which act on oriented order trees by orientation preserving homeomorphisms admit rectifiable left - invariant partial orders with simply connected extensions , as long as there is some point of the tree whose stabilizer is totally ordered . in fact , groups that act minimally on simply connected 1-manifolds admit simply connected partial orders ( see theorems  [ t : groupgetsorder ] and [ t : nontrivialstab ] ) , whereas a group that acts minimally only on a more general oriented order tree may not admit such a partial order , though it does admit an order with formal extension .",
    "the study of treelike structures is common throughout the literature , in for example the theories of @xmath1-trees , @xmath2-trees , protrees , dendrons , pretrees , etc .",
    "a certainly non - exhaustive survey of the literature developing the theories of such structures includes ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the notion of  betweenness \" and the associated betweenness relation is central to the theory of pretrees .",
    "bowditch and crisp  @xcite ,  @xcite have successfully used betweenness relations to generalize results for topological actions on @xmath1-trees to actions on pretrees .",
    "after we completed the constructions of section 4 , it came to our attention that the constructions of bowditch and crisp are very similar to our constructions . indeed",
    ", our betweenness relation on a set with a simply connected partial order does satisfy bowditch s notion of betweenness , and hence a simply connected poset has the structure of a pretree .",
    "however , the constructions in  @xcite and  @xcite applied to one of our groups would give an action on an @xmath1-tree without orientation , since the pretrees themselves have no notion of order .",
    "one could give a proof of theorem  [ t : order.to.action ] by strengthening the constructions of bowditch and crisp in the special case of a simply connected partial order to carry the full poset information ( referring the reader to those constructions ) , and then orienting the resulting @xmath1-trees and proving that their actions preserve the orientations .",
    "however , including the extra structure on the poset from the beginning allows for a more straightforward construction .",
    "hence , for reasons of both completeness and readability , we include in section 4 a self - contained exposition of our construction .",
    "we would like to thank rachel roberts for the many helpful conversations and useful advice and suggestions she gave throughout the writing of this paper .",
    "we would also like to thank indira chatterji for her interest in this class of partially ordered groups .",
