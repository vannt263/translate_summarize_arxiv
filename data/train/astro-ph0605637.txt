    "the observed discrepancy between the dynamical mass and the luminous mass of bounded astrophysical systems is generally attributed to the existence of an invisible form of matter , coined as the missing mass or dark matter .",
    "the nature of the dark matter particles is unknown but extensions of the standard model of particle physics provide a number of candidates  @xcite .",
    "the dark matter triggers the formation of large - scale structures by gravitational collapse and predicts the scale - dependence of density fluctuations .",
    "simulations suggest some universal dark matter density profile around ordinary matter distributions  @xcite .",
    "an important characteristic of dark matter , required by the necessity of clustering matter on small scales , is that it should be cold or non - relativistic at the epoch of the galaxy formation .",
    "however , the dark matter hypothesis has some difficulties  @xcite at explaining naturally the flat rotation curves of galaxies , one of the most persuasive evidence for the existence of dark matter , and the tully - fisher empirical relation  @xcite between the observed luminosity and the asymptotic rotation velocity of spiral galaxies",
    ".    on the other hand , the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) has been proposed by milgrom  @xcite as an alternative to the dark matter paradigm .",
    "it imputes the mass discrepancy not to the presence of some additional non - baryonic matter , but to failure of the newtonian law of gravity in an appropriate regime  a drastic change of paradigm .",
    "mond involves a single parameter @xmath0 being a constant acceleration scale , which delineates the specific mond regime , corresponding to accelerations much smaller than @xmath0 , from the newtonian regime , for which the accelerations are much larger .",
    "several relativistic extensions of mond , assuming the existence of extra fields associated with gravity , besides the spin-@xmath1 metric field of general relativity , have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "such extensions have culminated in the scalar - vector - tensor theory of bekenstein and sanders  @xcite .",
    "mond has been very successful at fitting the flat rotation curves of galaxies , and at recovering naturally the tully - fisher relation ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "intriguingly , the numerical value of @xmath0 that fits the data is close to the hubble scale , @xmath2 .",
    "mond may have also some observational problems : there are some counter - examples of galaxies where mond does not seem to account for the observed kinematics  @xcite , and , most importantly , the mass discrepancy at the scale of clusters of galaxies is not entirely explained by mond  @xcite .    in this article and the next one  @xcite ( hereafter paper  ii ) ,",
    "we take the view that mond does not represent a violation of the fundamental law of gravity , but , rather , provides us with an important hint on the ( probably unorthodox ) nature of the elusive dark matter . more precisely , we interpret the phenomenology behind mond as resulting from an effect of gravitational polarization , of some cosmic fluid made of dipole moments , and representing a new form of dark matter .",
    "the dipole moments get aligned in the gravitational field produced by ordinary masses , thereby enhancing the magnitude of the field and yielding mond .",
    "such effect is the gravitational analogue of the usual electrostatic effect , of polarization of a dielectic medium in an applied electric field  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we imagine , as a model for the dipole , a doublet of particles , one having a positive gravitational mass , the other having a negative and opposite gravitational mass , and with both particles being endowed with positive inertial masses . the gravitational behavior involving masses of this type is governed by a negative coulomb law ",
    "like masses attract and unlike masses repel  @xcite . as a result",
    "the dipole moment can not be stable : even if we neglect the repulsive gravitational force between the two particles , they will accelerate apart from each other in an exterior gravitational field produced by ordinary matter .",
    "we shall therefore invoke an internal force , of non - gravitational origin , between the two particles constituting the dipole , to bound them in a gravitational field .",
    "the mond acceleration scale @xmath0 will appear to be related to the properties of this internal `` microscopic '' force at short distances .",
    "we find that the motion of the dipolar particles violates the equivalence principle , and is driven by the _",
    "tidal _ gravitational field of ordinary matter , rather than the gravitational field itself . in this sense",
    "the dark matter is only weakly influenced by the distribution of ordinary matter .",
    "summarizing , in our approach the dark matter is described by a `` digravitational '' medium , which is subject to polarization in a gravitational field , and is otherwise essentially static ( an `` ether '' ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation of this dark matter is by the gravitational analogue of a plasma in electromagnetism , _",
    "i.e. _ composed of positive and negative gravitational masses , and oscillating at the natural plasma frequency . in a gravitational field",
    "the mean position of the masses is displaced from equilibrium and the plasma acquires a dipolar polarization .",
    "the observational predictions of the present ( non - relativistic ) model are the same as for mond .    in paper  ii we shall propose a relativistic model of dipolar particles , based on an action principle in general relativity .",
    "this model will be consistent with the equivalence principle , and as a result the dynamics of dipolar particles , even in the non - relativistic limit , will be different from that of the present quasi - newtonian model .",

    "ad hoc_.    taking the mond equation  ( [ mondeq ] ) at face , we notice a striking analogy with the usual equation of electrostatics describing the electric field inside a dielectric medium , namely @xmath17 , where the electric induction @xmath18 is proportional to the electric field @xmath19 ( at least for not too large electric fields ) : @xmath20 . here",

    "the dark matter consists of polarization masses with volume density @xmath35 given by  ( [ rhopol ] ) .",
    "for the moment we have restated the mond equation in the form ( [ rhopol])([mondpol ] ) and proposed a formal interpretation . to check this interpretation ,",
    "let us view the digravitational medium as consisting of individual dipole moments @xmath36 with number density @xmath37 , so that the polarization vector reads @xmath38 we suppose that the dipoles are made of a doublet of sub - particles , one with positive mass @xmath39 and one with negative mass @xmath40 , the masses which we are referring here are the _ gravitational masses _ of these particles , _",

    "the dipole moment thus consists of an ordinary particle , say @xmath46 , associated with an exotic particle , @xmath47 .",
    "the ordinary particle will always be attracted by an external mass distribution made of ordinary matter ; however , the other particle @xmath47 will always be _ repelled _ by the same external mass .",
    "in addition the two sub - particles will repel each other .",
    "we see therefore that the gravitational dipole is unstable , and we shall invoke a non - gravitational force to sustain it .",
    "we also expect that the external gravitational field will exert a torque on the dipole moment in such a way that its orientation has the positive mass @xmath39 oriented in the direction of the external mass , and the negative mass @xmath40 oriented in the opposite direction .",
    "we thus find that @xmath36 and @xmath30 should both point towards the external mass , _",
    "i.e. _ be oriented in the same direction as the external gravitational field @xmath48 . from eq .",
    "( [ pigi ] ) we therefore conclude that the susceptibility coefficient @xmath29 , in the gravitational case , must be _ negative _ : @xmath49 this corresponds to an `` _ _ anti - screening _ _ '' of the ordinary mass by the polarization masses , and _ enhancement _ of the gravitational field in the presence of the digravitational medium .",
    "this simply results from the fact that , in contrast to electrostatics , alike gravitational charges or masses always attract .",
    "the result  ( [ chisign ] ) is nicely compatible with the prediction of mond ; indeed we have @xmath50 in a straightforward interpolation between the mond and newtonian regimes , hence @xmath51 . the stronger gravitational field predicted by mond",
    "may thus be naturally interpreted by a process of anti - screening by polarization masses .",
    "to give more substance to the model , suppose that some interaction @xmath52 between the two constituents of the dipole is at work , and let the dipole moment be embedded into the gravitational field @xmath5 .",

    "the torque produced by the forces acting on the two sub - particles in the rhs of  ( [ xplus])([xmoins ] ) is given by @xmath71 this torque will tend to align the dipole moment with ( and in the same direction of ) the gravitational field .",
    "the prominent feature of the equation of motion  ( [ eom ] ) is the violation of the equivalence principle by the dipolar particle , as a result of the fact that the particle s inertial mass is @xmath72 while its gravitational mass is zero .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) has a structure different from the equation we obtain in the non - relativistic limit of the relativistic model of paper  ii  indeed , contrarily to the present quasi - newtonian model , the relativistic model is consistent with the equivalence principle ( see paper  ii for discussion ) .",

    "this represents a fundamental difference between the two models .",
    "in addition , of course , since the present model is newtonian it does not _ a priori _ allow ( in contrast to paper  ii ) to answer questions related to cosmology or the motion of relativistic particles .",
    "however , despite these differences , we shall recover in paper  ii the main characteristics of the mechanism of gravitational polarization .    from eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) the dipolar particle is expected to accelerate slowly in a given gravitational field , as compared to an ordinary particle .",
    "more precisely , we find that the particle is not directly subject to the gravitational field , but , rather , to its gradient , namely the _ tidal gravitational field _ @xmath78 . in the potential @xmath79 ( respectively the mond analogue @xmath80 ) , the acceleration is typically of the order of @xmath81 ( resp .",
    "@xmath82 ) .",
    "the observational consequence is that the dark matter consisting of a fluid of dipole moments is necessarily cold , and even `` colder '' than ordinary non - relativistic matter .",

    "the polarization vector @xmath85 is aligned with the gravitational field and the medium is polarized .",

( [ divf ] ) becomes that of a _ negative _ poisson equation corresponding to a negative newtonian force ( with `` anti - gravitational '' constant @xmath160 ) .",
    "on the other hand , in strong gravity ( @xmath161 ) we have @xmath162 and we see that the strength of the internal field @xmath128 becomes infinite . therefore the plasma gets locked in its undisturbed equilibrium state for which @xmath163 ( strictly speaking this is true if @xmath164 when @xmath16 ) . in this limit",
    "the dipolar medium is inactive ; there is no induced polarization and the newtonian law holds .",
    "note that there is clearly some amount of fine tuning in the present model ( and the one of paper  ii ) .",
    "namely the function @xmath165 is not determined from first principles within the model but is tuned to agree with the phenomenology of mond .",
    "in particular @xmath166 is not `` explained '' in the model but comes from astronomical observations . similarly @xmath167 is imposed in order to recover the newtonian regime where it is observed to be valid .    to conclude , the phenomenology of mond suggests the existence of a polarization mechanism at work at the scale of galactic structures , and which could be viewed as the gravitational analogue of the electric polarization of a dielectric material .",
    "the dark matter would consist of the polarization masses associated with some gravitational dipole moments aligned with the gravitational field of ordinary masses .",
    "we find that the properties of the dipolar dark matter are governed by the internal non - gravitational force linking together the constituents of the dipolar medium .",
    "the formulation of this medium in terms of an oscillating gravitational plasma polarized in the gravitational field is particular attractive . in paper",
    "ii we shall show how the notion of dipolar particle can be made compatible with the framework of general relativity .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank cdric deffayet , gilles esposito - farse , moti milgrom and jean - philippe uzan for interesting discussions .",

    "<S> the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) has been proposed as an alternative to the dark matter paradigm ; the philosophy behind is that there is no dark matter and we witness a violation of the newtonian law of dynamics . in this article , we interpret differently the phenomenology sustaining mond , as resulting from an effect of `` gravitational polarization '' , of some cosmic fluid made of dipole moments , aligned in the gravitational field , and representing a new form of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we invoke an internal force , of non - gravitational origin , in order to hold together the microscopic constituents of the dipole . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar particles are weakly influenced by the distribution of ordinary matter ; they are accelerated not by the gravitational field , but by its gradient , or tidal gravitational field . </S>"
