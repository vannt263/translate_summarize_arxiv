    "although the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been highly successful , it does not address some of the observed phenomena .",
    "for example , neutrinos in the sm are strictly massless .",
    "non - zero masses for the neutrinos have been firmly established through oscillations experiments conducted with atmospheric  @xcite , solar  @xcite , accelerator  @xcite and reactor  @xcite neutrinos , requiring modification of the minimal model .",
    "an aesthetic shortcoming of the sm , arising from the enormous freedom available in the yukawa lagrangian , is that it provides very little insight into the masses and mixings of quarks and leptons .",
    "this shortcoming is often dubbed as the `` flavor puzzle '' and many extensions of the sm are constructed to address this issue .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to interpret the apparently diverse set of flavor parameters ",
    "quark masses , quark mixing angles , charged fermion masses , neutrino masses and leptonic mixing angles  in a unified fashion probabilistically .    the observed masses in the charged fermion sector show a hierarchical structure , with the strongest hierarchy seen in the up - type quark sector , and a somewhat milder hierarchy seen in the down - type quark and charged lepton sectors .",
    "these mass parameters , at the momentum scale @xmath2 , are approximately given by ( in units of @xmath3 ) : @xmath4    in contrast , the two neutrino squared - mass differences measured in oscillation experiments yield values given by  @xcite @xmath5 adopting a normal ordering of the mass spectrum with @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the neutrino masses , these values would indicate a mild or almost no hierarchy with @xmath8 , quite different from the hierarchy seen in the other sectors ( cf : eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) ) .",
    "additionally , the inter - generational mixing angles in the quark sector are found to be small , while the leptonic mixing angles are measured to be large : @xmath9    understanding these patterns observed in the fermion spectrum is a fundamental unresolved problem in particle physics .",
    "various attempts have been made to explain the hierarchy in the charged fermion masses and mixings , adopting highly regulated mass matrices supported by flavor symmetries ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "random structure - less matrices may be better suited to explain the non - hierarchical mass spectrum and the large mixing angles observed in the neutrino sector  @xcite .",
    "the use of such random matrices to explain neutrino mixing angles has been termed `` anarchy hypothesis '' .",
    "a probability measure should be specified for these random matrices such that the matrix elements remain random after a basis transformation . for random unitary matrices",
    "this is achieved uniquely by the haar measure  @xcite .",
    "such matrices have been shown to be successful in explaining the observed large mixing angles in the neutrino sector  @xcite . when basis independence of the random matrix is combined with the requirement that each entry of the matrix has a distribution independent of other entries ,",
    "the measure gets determined uniquely to be gaussian  @xcite .",
    "anarchical neutrino mixing angles as well as mass ratios have been analyzed with the gaussian measure in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we unify the anarchy hypothesis in the neutrino sector with the hierarchy observed in the quark and charged lepton sectors   @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and analyze the resulting models from a probabilistic perspective .",
    "such a unification is achieved in the framework of @xmath0 grand unified theories , which treat quarks and leptons on similar footing .",
    "for concreteness we adopt a supersymmetric framework , which admits a one step symmetry breaking of @xmath0 down to the mssm .",
    "these models have at most three parameters which are hierarchical and determined from a fit to data .",
    "they also contain five complex yukawa coupling matrices which are taken to be structure - less or anarchical .",
    "elements of these yukawa coupling matrices are treated as uncorrelated random variables obeying gaussian distributions .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations of this framework and compare theoretical expectations with experimental data , which show good agreement .",
    "our main analysis is focused on the yukawa coupling structure obtained in susy @xmath0 unified theories where the three families of @xmath10 fermions mix with vector - like fermions belonging to @xmath11 representations that have gut scale masses @xcite .",
    "a variant of this model using the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite , where the three families of @xmath10 fermions are distinguished by a flavor @xmath1 symmetry while the three families of @xmath12 are universal , is also analyzed allowing for effective non - renormalizable operators @xcite .",
    "this class of models is a special case of the general class , with only two hierarchical input parameters . a second variant , also using a similar @xmath1 flavor symmetry , which now distinguishes the first family @xmath13 from the @xmath14 fields is also analyzed , with a single hierarchy parameter as input @xcite .",
    "good fit to the entire fermion spectrum is obtained in all cases with the yukawa couplings taking on uncorrelated gaussian distributions .",
    "it should be noted that ways to understand the neutrino mass anarchy along with charged fermion mass hierarchy has been explored in extra dimensional models with some success @xcite .",
    "these models have not yet been subject to a detailed monte carlo analysis for testing quantitatively the goodness of the fit .",
    "the ( renormalizable ) models we discuss here share some common qualitative features with these extra dimensional models .",
    "we also develop a constrained monte carlo simulation method to evaluate the figure of merit of the uncorrelated gaussian distributions adopted for the random variables . in this method",
    "we calculate a specific projection of the probability density distribution of the original random parameters onto a surface that corresponds to random parameters that satisfy the experimental constraints .",
    "the figure of merit that is optimized in this simulation is the distortion of the distributions of the random parameters with respect to their original ( unconstrained ) distributions .",
    "this constrained monte carlo result can be thought of as a multi - dimensional analog of the kolmogorov - smirnov statistical test for a single variable .",
    "our analysis shows that the distortions from the original gaussian distributions are not much , suggesting a good quality fit .",
    "while this class of models studied here can not be tested in their precise predictions , they may become strongly favored or disfavored once we know more about the neutrino mass and mixing parameters . with an anarchical structure the cp - violating parameter @xmath15 in the neutrino sector",
    "is found to be peaked at maximal values ( @xmath16 ) , although variations from these peak values are not excluded .",
    "the probability distribution of the neutrino mass ratio @xmath17 is peaked around 0.3 , with the probability of measuring it below 1/100 found to be about 4% .",
