    "this analogy leads to the introduction of the concept of pseudospin @xcite giving the carriers a chirality which is closely linked to these phenomena .",
    "graphene multilayers though being bound by a weak van der waals force posses energy spectra that are fundamentally different from the monolayer case @xcite .",

    "it was shown that the behavior of these bands @xcite , their response to an external applied gate voltage @xcite as well as the transport properties of the system @xcite strongly depend on the way the graphene sheets are stacked .",
    "the transport properties of bilayer graphene ( blg ) , the thinnest multilayer structure , has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "in contrast to monolayer graphene ( mlg ) , it was shown that , within the two band approximation , klein tunneling does not occur , i.e. the transmission for normal incidence is practically zero because , due to pseudospinorial arguments , the negative energy states are cloaked from the positive ones@xcite . however ,",
    "when the full - band hamiltonian model is considered , it was recently reported @xcite that normal transmission becomes possible for high enough potential barriers , which makes the higher energy bands available for conduction .",

    "these equivalences , together with the equivalence between the dirac points lead to the following symmetry in the reflection and transmission probability @xmath90where the second equation only holds if the first and the last region are equivalent .",
    "this decreases the number of different probabilities to only 6 reflection and 9 transmission probabilities for a general potential and to 6 transmission and 6 reflection probabilities for a @xmath1 junction .    a final remark considering the symmetry of the system with respect to the sign of the angle of incidence has to be made .",

    "these symmetry arguments are not valid anymore if a dg is applied since it breaks the interlayer sublattice equivalence of abc tlg and the separable behaviour of aba tlg electrons into mlg and blg like ones .",
    "non symmetric results are thus expected for such systems . although being counterintuitive , the occurrence of this asymmetry is not an unphysical result since the effect is exactly opposite for electrons near the other dirac point . in the second valley ,",
    "the electrons are described by a hamiltonian that is similar to that near the first dirac point , but with the exchange of @xmath100 and @xmath99 .",

    "while the scattered reflection keeps the interband symmetry @xmath132 , the scattered transmission differs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : abatransgrid](b ) we show the difference between both scattered reflection channels .",
    "the result makes clear that the scattered transmission is the same under a flip of the sign of @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath133 .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the time reversal symmetry of the system . as mentioned above",
    ", an electron scattering from band 1 to band 2 , near the dirac point @xmath134 , @xmath135 , is equivalent to one scattering from band 2 to band 1 near the other dirac point @xmath136 , @xmath137 . since the latter is the same as @xmath138 with a sign flip in @xmath91 , the scattered transmissions near the same dirac point are the same under a change of sign in @xmath91 .",
    "note that these asymmetric results are not carried through in the conductance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : conductancewrong](b ) we show the conductance for a @xmath0 and a finite width @xmath1 dg in aba tlg .",
    "the resonances caused by the @xmath139 channels show up as small bumps in the conductance when the fermi energy is below @xmath29 . for higher energy ,",
    "the contribution of the mlg like mode of propagation is marked by a rise in conductance due to the contribution of the @xmath125 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : translength ] the conductance is shown as function of the width of the @xmath1 dg with strength @xmath140 for different levels of the fermi energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : translength](a ) , we show the conductance for a fermi energy @xmath128 .",
    "now there is only one mode of propagation in the junction and the oscillatory behaviour is only due to the resonances of the @xmath126 term .",
    "the direct @xmath125 contribution diminishes exponentially since and obtains a finite value independent of the width of the junction , similar to the interband scattering contributions .",
    "[ fig : translength](b ) shows the conductance for @xmath141 .",
    "now the contributions of both direct channels , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , are almost equal and oscillate with the width of the junction while the scattered transmission oscillates oppositely . in this way",
    ", one can determine the amount of electrons scattered between the monolayer- and bilayer - like bands by applying a dg of the correct strength and width .",
    "in this paper we have studied the electronic transport in trilayer graphene through @xmath0 and @xmath1 junctions consisting of a single and a double gate . for abc tlg",
    "we have shown that the availability of different modes of propagation at higher energy leads to typical features in the conductance and that klein tunneling occurs only if there is no other propagation mode available .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated the effect of the band gap induced by a dg on abc tlg in the conductance and shown that the conductance is nearly zero in the gapped region .    we also modeled the effect of sg and dg gates on aba tlg and found that the sg behaviour is a superposition of a monolayer and bilayer like system .",
    "the dg however mixes both types of bands and breaks the angular symmetry with respect to normal incidence . this peculiar result emphasis the necessity to include both dirac points even if intervalley scattering is prohibited since the electron behaviour near the other dirac point restores the symmetry .",
    "the dg finally allows electrons to scatter between the monolayer and bilayer like bands and we have shown that the strength of scattering depends on the with the width of the @xmath1 junction and the fermi energy considered .",
