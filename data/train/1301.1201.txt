    "the lagrangian investigation of turbulence has dramatically improved in the last few years in experimental techniques , theoretical models and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "these progresses benefited from the increased range of reynolds numbers accessible for investigation ( in particular , for simulations ) and the improved accuracy of measurement techniques . on the theoretical side ,",
    "we have now phenomenological models able to quantitatively explain the lagrangian properties of turbulence such as , e.g. the statistics of velocity increments @xcite and accelerations @xcite .",
    "grounded on the successes of lagrangian investigations , recent experimental and numerical studies started to investigate the motion of complex objects in turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "the motivations are both fundamental and applicative . in this short note",
    "we suggest a possible technique to measure turbulent accelerations without the need of particle tracking , by means of the local measurement of the orientation of finite - size particles .",
    "the idea relies on spherical particles whose average density is that of the carrier fluid ( so that they are neutrally buoyant ) , but whose center of mass is displaced with respect to the geometrical center ( implying that the orientation is determined by the gravitational torque and that due to the fluid ) . by means of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) we show that information on particle orientation can be used to estimate fluid accelerations up to the order of gravitational acceleration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] we discuss the theoretical basis of the technique in its simplest implementation . sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] presents some preliminary validation of the method based on numerical simulations .",

    "[ sec4 ] is devoted to conclusions and perspectives .",
    ", width=188 ]    we consider the trajectory , @xmath0 , of a neutrally - buoyant sphere small enough such that its dynamics can be approximated by that of a passive tracer , @xmath1 transported by a flow @xmath2 . as sketched in fig.[fig1 ] , we assume that the particle center of mass @xmath3 is displaced by a distance @xmath4 with respect to the geometrical center o ( which is the center of buoyancy ) .",
    "the displacement determines the particle orientation , defined by the unit vector @xmath5 directed opposite to the center of mass .",
    "the direction @xmath5 is determined by the balance between the different torques acting on the particle . because of particle asymmetry , an external force @xmath6 , such as gravity @xmath7 , exerts a torque red@xmath8 .",
    "in addition , the particle immersed in a fluid experiences a viscous torque @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the fluid vorticity , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the fluid kinematic viscosity and density , respectively , and @xmath13 is the angular velocity of the sphere . if the particle reynolds number is very small , we can assume creeping flow conditions around the sphere , which impose equilibrium between the external forces and the viscous ones , in this particular case zero total torque @xmath14 .",
    "from the solid body rotation formula @xmath15 and @xmath16 we end with the following equation for the orientation @xcite @xmath17 + { 1 \\over 2 } { \\bm \\omega } \\times { \\bm p } \\ , , \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 denotes the total acceleration ( due to the flow and gravity ) on the sphere and the constant @xmath19 , having the dimension of a velocity , weighs the contribution of external forces to particle orientation .",
    "we remark that in the case of axisymmetric non - spherical particles an additional term is present in ( [ eq:2 ] ) @xcite .    equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) are valid in the limit of small , neutrally buoyant particles . if inertia is taken into account , particle motion is described by integro - differential equations containing added mass and history effects ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "no such effects will be considered here , consistently with our approximations . in a fluid at rest , the only external force entering eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is gravity , so that @xmath20 .",
    "the result is that particles orient upwards in a time @xmath21 .",
    "such phenomenon is well known in bio - fluid - dynamics , and is at the basis of the ability of some bottom - heavy phytoplankters to swim towards the sea surface ( a phenomenon dubbed _ negative gravitaxis _",
    "@xcite ) , maximizing the exposition to light and thus the photosynthetic activity .    in a turbulent flow , advected particles are subject to intense accelerations , so that , locally , gravity must be corrected due to inertial forces .",
    "the total acceleration @xmath22 acting on the particle is thus given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the fluid acceleration at the particle position .",
    "again , the assumption that the acceleration of the particle is equal to that of the fluid implies particles smaller than few @xmath25 .",
    "numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite investigations showed that particles larger than @xmath25 sense accelerations smaller than tracers .",
    "if one restricts to diameters up to @xmath26 the error on the rms value should be less than @xmath27 .",
    "there is indication that such larger particles can accurately be described by including faxen s corrections in the equation of motion @xcite .    in the following , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume that fluid acceleration is smaller than gravity , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "this is true for flows at moderate reynolds numbers only @xcite , but this assumption greatly simplifies the analysis of ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "formally , we can write @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , with @xmath30 a small non - dimensional number .",
    "further we consider the limit of fast reorientation , which amounts to requiring that the reorientation time @xmath31 is smaller than the kolmogorov time @xmath32 .",
    "if one estimates @xmath33 and assumes @xmath34 in the definition of @xmath35 , fast orientation consistently implies @xmath36 .",

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) reduces to @xmath39 , which explicitly reads    @xmath40    from ( [ eq:3 ] ) one can see that the orientation vector must have the form @xmath41 , indeed as @xmath42 the correction to @xmath43 will be @xmath44 so that we can neglect it at this level .",
    "plugging the expression for @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , at @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 . in conclusion , measuring the orientation of the particle with respect to the vertical we can measure two components of the fluid acceleration @xmath48 this result is valid under the assumption that @xmath49 and , therefore , in general for not too high re .",
    "this condition together with the smallness of the vorticity term implies fast orientation ( @xmath50 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "if @xmath35 is too large , the first effect we expect is that vorticity becomes relevant , with an increase of the tilting angle , so that using ( [ eq:4 ] ) could lead to an over - estimate of accelerations . in more general conditions ,",
    "it is in principle still possible to use ( [ eq:2 ] ) to gather information on the acceleration statistics but this requires less direct procedures , which we will not consider in this preliminary study .",
    "in this section we illustrate the behavior of geotropic particles in realistic turbulent flows and explore the range of validity of the result ( [ eq:4 ] ) by means of dns of the dynamics of geotropic tracers together with the navier - stokes equations for an incompressible flow .",
    "trajectories ( up to @xmath51 ) are stored together with @xmath52 and @xmath53 in statistically stationary conditions .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) is then integrated starting from random orientations and for different values of @xmath35 . after an initial transient of the order of @xmath31 , during",
    "which particles forget their initial orientation , we can compare the acceleration @xmath54 with the prediction of eq .",

    "we have performed simulations of homogeneous - isotropic turbulence by means of a parallel pseudo - spectral code in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions at @xmath55 with resolution @xmath56 .",
    "statistical stationarity was maintained via a gaussian , delta - correlated in time , random forcing at small wave - numbers .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is integrated evaluating the velocity at particle position by means of trilinear interpolation .",
    "moreover , we have also exploited a database @xcite of previously simulated lagrangian trajectories at resolution @xmath57 and @xmath58 , for which acceleration and vorticity were available .",
    "equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) was integrated using a second - order adams - bashforth scheme . in order to get physical relevance from the dns we rescale space and time with dimensional values .",

    "such distributions confirm a tendency of smaller particles to overestimate accelerations .",
    "only for @xmath86 the largest particles underestimate accelerations , as can be seen by the low tails of the corresponding pdf in fig.[fig4 ] and by a slight asymmetry of @xmath116 towards quadrants in which @xmath117 .",
    "the strongly intermittent nature of both acceleration and vorticity suggests to investigate in more detail how accurately accelerations of different magnitude can be estimated via ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "the conditional average @xmath118 is shown in fig.[fig6 ] for both values of @xmath92 .",
    "let us first consider the curves at @xmath94 .",
    "it is evident that larger particles ( i.e. with faster reorientation time ) provide better estimates : the largest particles , with @xmath75 give a minimum relative error of around 0.2 . through most of the observed range ,",
    "the relative error is smaller for larger accelerations , because the effect of vorticity decreases accordingly .",
    "indeed , the same figure also compares the relative error with @xmath119 , showing that , for all but the largest accelerations , the error in the estimate comes from the vorticity term in ( [ eq:2 ] ) , consistently with the assumption of fast orientation . for accelerations larger than @xmath120 the effect of finite gravity causes deviations from this behaviour and eventually an increase of the relative error , as expected .",
    "this effect is less evident for smaller particles , most likely because they tend to overestimate the acceleration while the finite gravity effect leads to an underestimate so that there is a compensation between the two opposite effects .",
    "the right panel shows that the effect of finite gravity is much larger for @xmath86 , as expected .",
    "however , one should note that the vorticity term would give with the same particles a smaller error in this second case than for @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , by estimating the error due to vorticity as @xmath121 one would get a value about 1.9 smaller for the higher @xmath122 , compatible within @xmath123 with the numerical results around @xmath124 .",
    "we stress that this observation is not valid in general : it is a consequence of the fact that , in our case , the flow at higher re has a larger effective integral scale and a larger @xmath125 .",
    "summarizing our numerical results , it appears that the orientation of biased particles could be a viable proxy for fluid acceleration , at least at moderate re .",
    "it is clearly important to establish a way to estimate the proper particle size based on the parameters of the turbulent flow to be examined .",
    "although particle size does not directly enter the model equations , the offset @xmath4 clearly puts a lower limit on particle radius .",
    "this point must be carefully considered .",
    "particles should be sufficiently biased to ensure dominance of acceleration over rotation due to vorticity , but too large particles would not obey the assumptions leading to ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) .    on the other hand , experimental limitations should be considered . in order to use ( [ eq:4 ] ) to directly measure",
    "fluid acceleration one has to measure the tilt angle of a geotropic particle transported by the flow .",
    "one possibility is to use small spherical particles with the upper and lower hemisphere of different colors as in the example of fig.[fig1 ] , a simpler version of the technique used in @xcite . by measuring the angle @xmath126 of the particle `` equator '' with respect to the horizontal plane one has @xmath127 .",
    "a precise determination of @xmath126 requires sufficient resolution of the particle pattern and therefore not too small particles . on the other hand , because the measure is instantaneous , there is no need to follow the particles .",
    "therefore , the camera could be placed to zoom a small region of the fluid only , and to acquire data when a particle comes in that region .",
    "let us finally comment about possible corrections to the described behavior , for the two cases of particles too small or too large . if the offset @xmath4 is too small , the vorticity term in ( [ eq:2 ] ) is no longer negligible . as a consequence ,",
    "reconstruction of acceleration would require independent information on vorticity , so that a more complex method would be required .",
    "furthermore , fast orientation is at the basis of ( [ eq:4 ] ) which allows one to avoid particle tracking , and would be important to follow high frequency fluctuations accurately . in the case of too large particles ,",
    "the creeping flow assumption would be inaccurate .",
    "nonetheless , the tilting angle would still provide information on the fluid acceleration but equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) has to be modified to take inertial terms into account .",
    "a further aspect that should be taken into account is finite size effects on particle trajectory . in general",
    "one expects that particles larger than the kolmogorov scale deviate from fluid trajectories .",
    "however there is evidence that acceleration statistics are not strongly influenced by particle size @xcite .",
    "numerical and experimental results suggest that addition of the so called faxen terms in the equation for particle trajectory can account for the main deviations , providing a method to estimate the related errors@xcite .",
    "such corrections should become relevant when the radius of the particle is larger than @xmath128 , which for experiments comparable to the ones we considered would give @xmath129 @xcite thus allowing for some range of sizes to explore .",
    "given the above constraints we can conclude that the proposed method would be reasonably accurate for typical experimental settings at moderate reynolds numbers or when large reynolds number are achieved thanks to a large integral scale . in spite of the above discussed limitations , we think that the idea of exploiting biased particles to measure acceleration without tracking may be interesting especially if technology can be pushed to the possibility to measure the tilting angle of many particles at the same time , allowing for the reconstruction of the spatial field of accelerations ."
