    "in addition , there are excited vector states with spin-1 such as the @xmath11 states @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , the @xmath15 states @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the @xmath18 states @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "also , there exist bound @xmath21  mesons such as the @xmath22 states @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the @xmath26 resonance which is the source of @xmath27  mesons at the kekb and pep - ii @xmath28  @xmath0  factories with the belle and  experiments .",
    "the @xmath5 state @xmath29 @xmath30 , recently discovered at  @xcite , is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite contributed to this conference .",
    "in addition to @xmath0  mesons states , there exist baryons containing @xmath31  quarks . the lowest baryon state is the  with quark content @xmath32 .",
    "other bottom baryons with @xmath33 are the ( @xmath34 ) as well as the @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and the @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) plus their @xmath39 excited states @xmath40 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath38 ) . in this paper , a heavy @xmath0  hadron is defined as all @xmath0  states outlined above except for the  and @xmath7  mesons .",
    "since the properties of @xmath42 states are covered by other presentations at this conference  @xcite , we shall focus on ,  mesons and excited @xmath0  states ( generically called @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) as well as bottom baryons including the  baryon , the  baryon states plus the  and .    after defining `` heavy @xmath0  hadron '' ,",
    "we explain what is meant by `` properties '' of @xmath0  hadrons . under properties we understand masses , lifetimes and decay properties of heavy @xmath0  hadrons .",
    "this brings us to the question of `` why study @xmath0  hadron states '' ?",
    "a physicist typically first comes into contact with the discussion of states while studying the hydrogen atom in quantum mechanics .",
    "the spectroscopy of the h - atom is explained as transitions between the various energy levels of the hydrogen atom .",
    "this prime example of quantum mechanics allows us to draw parallels to the study and spectroscopy of @xmath0  hadrons .",
    "the hydrogen atom consists of a heavy nucleus in the form of the proton which is surrounded by a light electron .",
    "the spectrum of the hydrogen atom is sensitive to the interaction between proton and electron , which is based on the electromagnetic coulomb interaction and described by quantum electrodynamics in its ultimate form . in analogy ,",
    "a @xmath0  hadron consists of a heavy bottom quark surrounded either by a light anti - quark , to form a @xmath0  meson or a di - quark pair , to form a bottom baryon .",
    "the interaction between the @xmath31  quark and the other quark(s ) in a @xmath0  hadron is based on the strong interaction or quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is often stated that heavy quark hadrons are the hydrogen atom of qcd .",
    "the study of @xmath0  hadron states is thus the study of ( non - perturbative ) qcd , providing sensitive tests of potential models , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and all aspects of qcd , including lattice gauge calculations .      in the spectator model of @xmath0",
    "hadron decay , the @xmath31 quark decays like a free particle . the other ( anti-)quark(s ) in the hadron act as pure spectators without influencing the @xmath31  quark decay .",
    "in such a simple weak decay picture , the lifetimes of all @xmath0  hadrons would be equal .",
    "in reality , the strong force in the form of gluons , coupling to the quarks , as well as final state interactions , influence the pure weak decay .",
    "measurements of @xmath0  hadron lifetimes thus study the interplay between the strong and weak interaction .",
    "predictions of @xmath0  hadron lifetimes are provided in the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) which in turn allows us to expand the inclusive decay width @xmath43 in powers @xmath44 of the bottom quark mass @xmath45 in hqe short distance effects contained in the wilson coefficients @xmath46 , evaluated in perturbation theory , are separated from long distance physics represented by the matrix element @xmath47 to be computed through non - perturbative qcd sum rules , operator product expansion methods or lattice qcd calculations . in hqe",
    "the order @xmath48 distinguishes meson versus baryon decays while spectator effects of order @xmath49 differentiate between the lifetimes of , @xmath50 and  mesons .",
    "these calculations allow for precise predictions of @xmath0  hadron lifetimes where many can be found in the literature .",
    "reference  @xcite only quotes a few of them .",
    "most of these predictions can be summarized in form of the following estimates for @xmath0  hadron lifetime ratios @xmath51 measurements of @xmath0  hadron lifetimes thus test the validity of hqe , a technique which is also used to supply input for the extraction of elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix .",
    "since history always provides guidance , figure  [ fig : blifehistory ] shows the history of measurements of the average @xmath0  hadron lifetime which starts with the first measurement of the average lifetime of bottom hadrons  @xcite in 1983 .",
    "the markii detector measured @xmath52  ps which is within large errors in agreement with the current average @xmath0  hadron lifetime as determined by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : blifehistory ] indicates that all early measurements of bottom hadron lifetimes appear to obtain low central values compared to the current world average until the availability of precision measurements pined down the current world average .",
    "such an effect seems to repeat itself in other @xmath0  hadron lifetime measurements as we shall see later .",
    "the producers of hadrons containing @xmath31  quarks are currently the kekb and pep - ii @xmath28 colliders together with the belle and  experiments , as well as the fermilab tevatron where the cdf and d0  experiments are operating . at the fermilab tevatron all @xmath0  hadrons are produced . besides the  and @xmath50  meson , which are the only bottom hadrons produced at the @xmath0  factories operating at the @xmath26 resonance , the tevatron is a source for  and @xmath53  mesons as well as baryons containing @xmath31  quarks such as the ,  or .",
    "it has been common believe that the study of  properties is the domain of the cdf and d0 experiments operating at the tevatron .",
    "however , it has recently become possible to produce  events in sufficiently large numbers in @xmath28  collisions at the @xmath54 resonance which can decay into pairs of @xmath55 , @xmath56 or @xmath57 . the kekb collider operating at the @xmath54 resonance at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath58  gev",

    "the obtained branching fraction is compatible with the cdf result  @xcite and is slightly higher than @xmath65 by @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , belle observes @xmath67 signal events from decays @xmath68 and measures the branching ratio @xmath69\\times10^{-4}$ ] with a significance of @xmath70 .    after a successful 1992 - 1996 runi data taking period of the fermilab tevatron ( for a review of @xmath0  physics results from e.g.  cdf in runi see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the tevatron operates in runii at a centre - of - mass energy of 1.96  tev with a bunch crossing time of 396  ns generated by @xmath71 @xmath72 bunches .",
    "the initial tevatron luminosity steadily increased from 2002 to 2008 with a peak luminosity of @xmath73  @xmath74s@xmath60 reached in 2008 .",
    "the total integrated luminosity delivered by the tevatron to cdf and d0 at the time of this conference is @xmath75  fb@xmath60 with about @xmath76  fb@xmath60 recorded to tape by each collider experiment .",
    "however , most results presented in this review use about 1 - 3  fb@xmath60 of data . the features of the cdf and d0 detectors are described elsewhere in references  @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for the remainder of this paper , we will focus on results from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0 .",
    "in the neutral  system there exist two flavour eigenstates , the @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the time evolution of these states is governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath79 \\left(\\begin{array}{c }    \\end{array}\\right ) \\quad\\quad { \\rm{with}}\\ \\   { \\bf{m}}= \\left(\\begin{array}{cc } m_0 & m_{12 } \\\\ m_{12}^ * & m_0 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right ) \\quad { \\rm{and}}\\ \\   \\bf{\\gamma}= \\left(\\begin{array}{cc } \\gamma_0 & \\gamma_{12 } \\\\ \\gamma_{12}^ * & \\gamma_0 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right),\\ ] ] where * m * is the mass matrix and @xmath80 is the decay matrix .",
    "the mass eigenstates  and  are admixtures of the flavour eigenstates  and : @xmath81 the fact that the mass eigenstates are not the same as the flavour states gives rise to oscillations between the  and  states with a frequency proportional to the mass difference of the mass eigenstates , @xmath82 . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "particle - antiparticle oscillations are explained in terms of second - order weak processes involving virtual massive particles that provide a transition amplitude between the  and  states .",
    "the decay width difference between the mass eigenstates @xmath83 is related to the @xmath3  phase @xmath84 .",
    "assuming no @xmath3  violation in the  system , which is justified in the standard model where the @xmath3  phase is expected to be small ( @xmath85  @xcite ) , the  mass eigenstates are also @xmath3  eigenstates where @xmath86 is the width of the @xmath3  even state corresponding to the short lived state in analogy to the kaon system where the short - lived state ( @xmath87 ) is @xmath3  even .",
    "@xmath88 is the width of the @xmath3  odd state corresponding to the long lived  state .",
    "thus the experimental observables describing the  system are the masses @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the  mass eigenstates accessible through a measurement of the mass difference  in -  oscillations .",
    "other experimental quantities are the width difference , the total decay width @xmath91 , which is related to the mean  lifetime @xmath92 , as well as the @xmath3  phase  @xmath93 .      in the light of a substantial width difference",
    ", the  system contains short- and long - lived components similar to the kaon system and various  decay channels will have different proportions of the  and  eigenstates .",
    "lifetime measurements of different final states have therefore different meaning and can be broken down into several categories . first , there are flavour specific decays , such as semileptonic @xmath94 or @xmath62 decays , which have equal fractions of  and  at proper time zero from where both components will evolve with their specific lifetimes @xmath95 and @xmath96 . fitting a single exponential to such a decay distribution measures",
