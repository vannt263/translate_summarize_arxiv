    "the quark propagator is one of the fundamental quantities in qcd . by studying the momentum - dependent quark mass function in the infrared region we can gain valuable insight into the mechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the associated dynamical generation of mass .",
    "there have been several studies of the momentum space quark propagator  @xcite in landau gauge using different fermion actions .",
    "here we focus on the overlap fermion action and extend previous work  @xcite to three lattices with different lattice spacing @xmath2 at fixed physical volume .",
    "this allows us to study the approach of the landau gauge quark propagator to the continuum limit .",
    "the study of the overlap quark propagator in the gribov copy free laplacian gauge is underway and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in a covariant gauge in the continuum , the renormalized euclidean space quark propagator has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the renormalization point . the renormalization point boundary conditions are chosen to be @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the renormalized quark mass an ultraviolet renormalization point . the functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , or alternatively @xmath9 and @xmath10 , contain all of the nonperturbative information of the quark propagator .",
    "note that @xmath10 is renormalization point independent , _",
    "i.e. _ , since @xmath11 is multiplicatively renormalizable all of the renormalization - point dependence is carried by @xmath9 .",
    "for sufficiently large momenta the effects of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking become negligible , _",
    "i.e. _ , for large @xmath12 and we have @xmath13 up to logarithmic corrections , where @xmath14 is the perturbative running mass .    when all interactions for the quarks are turned off , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the gluon field vanishes ( or the links are set to one ) , the quark propagator has its tree - level form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bare quark mass .",
    "when the interactions with the gluon field are turned on we have @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the regularization parameter - in this case , the lattice spacing - and @xmath18 is the quark wave - function renormalization constant chosen so as to ensure @xmath19 . for simplicity of notation",
    "we suppress the @xmath2-dependence of the bare quantities .    on the lattice",
    "we expect the bare quark propagators , in momentum space , to have a similar form as in the continuum , except that the @xmath20 invariance is replaced by a 4-dimensional hypercubic symmetry on an isotropic lattice . hence , the inverse lattice bare quark propagator takes the general form @xmath21 we use periodic boundary conditions in the spatial directions and anti - periodic in the time direction .",
    "the discrete momentum values for a lattice of size @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are @xmath25    the overlap fermion formalism  @xcite realizes an exact chiral symmetry on the lattice and is automatically @xmath26 improved",

    "\\label{diracop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the negative wilson mass @xmath30 is then related to @xmath31 by @xmath32 and mean - field improvement allows the use of the tree - level value @xmath33 .",
    "the wilson parameter is typically chosen to be @xmath34 and we will also use @xmath34 here in our numerical simulations .",
    "the dimensionless quark mass parameter is @xmath35 the overlap quark propagator is given by the equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 \\ , .",
    "\\label{d_mu}\\ ] ]    at tree - level , the inverse bare lattice quark propagator becomes the tree - level version of ( eq .  [ invquargen ] ) @xmath38 we calculate @xmath39 directly by setting the links to unity in the coordinate space quark propagator and taking its fourier transform .",
    "it is then possible to identify the appropriate kinematic lattice momentum directly from the definition @xmath40 the form of @xmath41 is shown and its analytic form given in ref .",
    "having identified the appropriate kinematical lattice momentum @xmath42 , we can now define the bare lattice propagator as @xmath43 this ensures that the free lattice propagator is identical to the free continuum propagator .",
    "due to asymptotic freedom the lattice propagator will also approach the continuum form at large momentum . in the gauge sector , this analysis approach dramatically improves the gluon propagator  @xcite .",
    "the two lorentz invariants can now be @xmath44 while @xmath45 is directly dependent on our choice of momentum , @xmath42 , the mass function @xmath46 is indirectly dependent on this choice . in the case of staggered quarks",
    "it has been seen that the kinematic momentum derived from tree - level analysis of the action is a good choice of momentum for the mass function  @xcite .",
    "this is an empirical result .",
    "the tree - level behavior of the overlap quark propagator is rather different , however , and a different approach may be needed .",
    "we investigate this issue by analyzing the scaling behavior of the propagator over three values of the lattice spacing at constant physical volume .",
    "we present results from three lattice ensembles , each with a different lattice spacing , @xmath2 , but having the same physical volume .",
    "lattice parameters are summarized in table  [ simultab ] .",
    "the gauge configurations were created using a tadpole improved plaquette plus rectangle ( lscher - weisz  @xcite ) gauge action .",
    "each ensemble consists of 50 configurations .",
    "the lattice spacing was determined by the static quark potential using the string tension @xmath47  mev  @xcite .",
    ".[simultab]lattice parameters .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the difference between the quadratic and linear extrapolations is no great surprise as our quark masses are rather heavy .",
    "this is a constraint of the volume .",
    "the relevant point is that there is good agreement between the two lattices when @xmath48 is the momentum , but not when @xmath42 is the momentum .",
    "the momentum space quark propagator has been calculated in landau gauge on three lattices with different lattice spacing @xmath2 but very similar physical volumes in order to explore the approach to the continuum limit .",
    "we calculated the nonperturbative momentum - dependent wave function renormalization @xmath0 and the nonperturbative mass function @xmath1 for a variety of bare quark masses .",
    "we also explored the quark propagator in the chiral limit .",
    "as previously anticipated  @xcite , the continuum limit for @xmath0 is approached most rapidly when it is plotted against the kinematical lattice momentum @xmath42 , whereas for the quark mass function , @xmath1 , we have found that using the discrete lattice momentum @xmath48 provides the most rapid approach to the continuum limit .",
    "future work should test our conclusions and further explore the continuum limit with one or more additional finer lattice spacings .",
    "in addition , it will be necessary to use both finer and larger volume lattices , in particular to study the infrared behavior of @xmath49 .",
    "one can also use other kernels in the overlap fermion formalism , e.g. , using a fat - link irrelevant clover ( flic ) action  @xcite as the overlap kernel  @xcite in order to further establish the robustness of our conclusions and to provide more accurate data .",
    "these studies are currently underway and results will be reported elsewhere .",
