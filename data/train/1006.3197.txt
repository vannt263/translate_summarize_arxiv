    "the electromagnetic equations of motion are neutral differential delay equations and have a qualitative behavior quite far from ordinary differential equations ( ode ) @xcite .",
    "we  include a brief discussion of some generic qualitative properties of neutral differential delay equations relevant for the microscopic modeling . as with any modeling ,",
    "if one starts with a narrow enough setup it is easy to obtain impossibility proofs , and the next step is usually harder , i.e. , to define a wider minimum setup .",
    "we discuss our models in the light of available experimental work @xcite and a finite variational method for the wheeler - feynman electrodynamics@xcite .",
    "no single realistic dynamical model based on electrodynamics has been analyzed down to microscopic detail up to now .",
    "the existing gap has two causes ( i ) electrodynamics itself was not a finished theory in the early 20th century ; the first equation of motion for a point - charge @xcite appeared in 1938 and a form free of self - interaction @xcite only in 1945 and ( ii ) the theory of dynamical systems was not out in the early days of point - charge - electrodynamics , neither tools existed to understand the complex dynamics described by differential delay equations . on the other hand",
    "there is the popular quantum schism created by failed naive attempts to complete quantum mechanics with a galilei - invariant mechanics based on ordinary differential equations with globally @xmath0 trajectories and instantaneous interactions .",
    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) was successfully developed as a machian probabilistic theory , and there are several hints that a dynamics with newtonian ordinary differential equations is _ not _ sufficient to complete qm . even though the simplest quantum operators are pedagogically constructed by analogy with galilei - invariant mechanics ,",
    "a classical dynamics with ordinary differential equations is useless either to complete qm _ or _ to approximate the neutral differential delay equations of motion of point - charge - electrodynamics , as we show here .",
    "it is known that the no - go - theorems of bell type fail for non - instantaneous interactions @xcite even without invoking the generic properties of neutral differential delay equations and variational methods with boundary conditions in the future , as discussed here .",
    "nevertheless , there has been no attempt to complete qm with detailed modeling as regards the double - slit experiment .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : in section [ section ii ] we discuss existing experimental results on double - slit scattering , including a controlled ballistic experiment that found an unexpected qualitative disagreement @xcite and the later claims @xcite that the double - slit experiment should not display the simple interference based on a single de broglie wave . we give a simplified model based on electromagnetic trajectories with vanishing far - fields , a model that explains the qualitative results of interference . in section [ section iii ]",
    "we discuss the equations of motion of point charges of the wheeler - feynman electrodynamics and the electromagnetic variational method @xcite . in section [ section iii ]",
    "we also work out the details of a model for scattering with each slit represented by a heavy neutral atom , a system with little recoil that is not destroyed upon scattering , unlike a model for bowling .",
    "we introduce a simple approximation for the dynamics with ( discontinuous ) piecewise - defined - velocities and piecewise - constant - velocities for the scattered charge .",
    "our model predicts the qualitative dependence of the de broglie wavelength on the incoming electronic velocity and calculates the de broglie wavelength in the correct order of magnitude . in section [ discussions ]",
    "we put the discussions and conclusion . in appendix",
    "a we discuss the qualitative properties of differential delay- and neutral differential delay equations with generic initial conditions .",
    "these qualitative properties when included in detailed modeling might offer further possible experimental tests for electromagnetic modeling and the completion of qm . in appendix",
    "b we discuss some models for scattering by a periodic crystal .",
    "the modeling again reaches a qualitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "usually , the quantum explanation of double - slit diffraction is contrasted to simple billiard - ball - like - one - body - dynamics , and no microscopic model or time - dependent variables of the apparatus are ever introduced tonomura , jonsson .",
    "let us start by defining this popular no - go modeling of scattering , henceforth called the billiard - ball - model ; this model assumes the electron interacts with the slit walls by contact forces only .",
    "according to this model , if one closes one slit at a time , an outwardly scattered electron _ must _ have gone through the open slit without having interacted with the closed slit at all ( because interaction is by contact only ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the statistical pattern at a far screen with both slits open should be the sum of two one - slit patterns , in bold contradiction with the predictions of schroedinger s equation _ and _ the experimental results .",
    "on the other hand , the popular quantum model of double - slit diffraction is the scalar diffraction for the wave equation , a schroedinger equation often pedagogically introduced by analogy with billiard - ball dynamics , with a potential vanishing everywhere but at slit boundaries .",
    "we stress that even though it is time - proven that the analogy works well from the galilei - invariant dynamics to abstract quantum operators , using the analogy backwards to construct a dynamical system to complete quantum mechanics is far another problem . the reverse analogy",
    "_ from _ the scalar wave diffraction _ to _ the billiard - ball dynamics is not granted ; the difficulties with this _ reverse analogy _",
    "become apparent when we consider the _ _  realistic _ _ quantum mechanical model for a _ real electron with spin _ , approaching a realistic material slit composed of electrons and protons .",
    "the realistic quantum description is as follows ; the incoming electron has a de broglie distance of influence @xmath1 ,  so that its wavefunction overlaps the wavefunctions of the electrons at the material _ before _",
    "it hits the slit .",
    "because of the exclusion principle , already at a distance @xmath1 , the electronic spin could flip due to this overlap . flipping the spin",
    "gives the incoming electron an orbital - angular - momentum - kick of the order of @xmath2 ( electronic spin carries an angular momentum of @xmath3 ) .",
    "this change - by - spin - flip of the orbital - angular - momentum produces diffraction , even _ before _ the electrons hits any slit .",
    "notice that quantum mechanics with spin suggests that the electron suffers an angular - momentum kick without having to pass by any slit , actually even before going through one of the slits .",
    "therefore , the careful quantum mechanical analysis of diffraction _ with spin _ suggests a microscopic model with an interaction that can change the orbital angular momentum at - a - distance ( rather than a billiard - ball dynamics ) .",
    "if the distance between slits is @xmath4 and the incoming electron has mass @xmath5 and velocity @xmath6 , the largest orbital - angular - momentum about an axis passing by one slit belongs to a trajectory passing by the other slit , i.e. , @xmath7 ( higher trajectories simply hit the wall and do not pass to the other side ) .",
    "the largest scattering due to the @xmath2 angular - momentum - kick of the flipping spin happens when @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9which is the familiar slit - separation for significant scattering . in",
    "the electromagnetic microscopic modeling the electron interacts with both slits at a distance @xmath1 before passing through one slit , unlike the interaction by contact of the billiard - ball model .",
    "so much to say the confusion generated by the billiard - ball straw - man - model is unacceptable moot .",
    "the first double - slit experiment @xcite was performed in 1961 , obtaining a scattering pattern in qualitative agreement with the quantum predictions .",
    "the first ballistic experiment with a single electron in the apparatus at a time @xcite was performed in 1989 by tonomura et al @xcite , obtaining a build - up of fringe patterns in qualitative agreement with quantum mechanics and the huygens interference .",
    "it seems that so far no one has claimed quantitative precision beyond order of magnitude for the double - slit experiment . in 1994",
    "an unexpected periodicity was found in a controlled ballistic experiment of double - slit scattering @xcite .",
    "the anomalous periodicity was later explained @xcite  as due to multiple scattering processes , but the quantum mechanical explanation made explicit use of a _ realistic _",
    "model  @xcite .",
    "the explanation @xcite also made evident the need for a realistic quantum modeling and as a bonus seemed to rule out a precise experimental realization of the popular idealized experiment .",
    "this situation should be contrasted to electronic diffraction in crystals and periodic structures , where bragg directions can be determined very precisely . for the case of a crystal ,",
    "the microscopic modeling captures the essential experimental results even with ordinary differential equations , as discussed in appendix b.    in the following we introduce a microscopic model for double - slit - diffraction consisting of the scattered electron in addition to an electron bound to each heavy positive charge at each slit site , which are separated by the slit distance @xmath4 .",
    "our model uses the wheeler - feynman equations of motion of point charges keeping only the far - field interactions .",
    "our simplification stems from four reasons : ( i ) we disregard the short - range coulomb interactions that are approximately cancelled by charge neutrality , ( ii ) we ignore the short - ranged biot - savart interactions that are small at low velocities , ( iii ) we keep the terms that introduce neutral delay in the differential equations , i.e. , the far - field - couplings between point charges , which depend on the retarded / advanced accelerations , and ( iv ) the far - field interactions have the longest range , representing naturally the first physical interaction suffered by the electron when approaching the double - slit and scattering away .",
