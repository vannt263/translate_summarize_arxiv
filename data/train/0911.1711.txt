    "four - dimensional black hole solutions of einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field have been an avenue of intense research for many years .",

    ", stable solutions were found numerically for spherical geometries  @xcite and an exact solution in asymptotically ads space with hyperbolic geometry was presented in  @xcite and generalized later to include charge  @xcite .",
    "this solution is perturbatively stable for negative mass and may develop instabilities for positive mass  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of this solution were studied in  @xcite where it was shown that there is a second order phase transition of the hairy black hole to a pure topological black hole without hair .",
    "the analytical and numerical calculation of the quasi - normal modes of scalar , electromagnetic and tensor perturbations of these black holes confirmed this behaviour  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new exact solution of a charged c - metric conformally coupled to a scalar field was presented in  @xcite .",

    "we find that the hairy black hole is stable near the conformal point if the mass is negative and may develop instabilities in the case of positive mass .",
    "we also study the thermodynamics of our solutions . calculating the free energy we find that there is a critical temperature above which the hairy black hole loses its hair to a black hole in vacuum .",
    "this critical temperature occurs at a point where the black hole mass flips sign , as in the case of the mtz black hole @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , mtz black holes , which have hyperbolic horizons and obey the boundary conditions ( [ eqbcphi ] ) with @xmath27 , can be stable if they have negative mass @xcite .",

    "do not alter this result qualitatively .",
    "next we perform a detailed analysis of thermodynamics and examine several values of the coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "henceforth we shall work with units in which @xmath95 .",
    "we begin with a geometrical characteristic of the hairy black hole , the horizon radius @xmath96 ( root of @xmath97 ( eq .  ( [ psiconf ] ) ) . in figure [ horizons ] we show the @xmath98 dependence of the horizon for representative values of the coupling constant , @xmath99 and @xmath100 we observe that , for @xmath101 the horizon may correspond to more than one value of the parameter @xmath102 for @xmath103 we see that , additionally , there is a maximum value of the horizon radius .",
    "we note that one may express the radius of the horizon @xmath104 in terms of the dimensionless parameter = as r_+ = [ rhm3 ]  .",
    "the temperature reads t =  , [ tm3 ] or equivalently t=  , a third order equation in @xmath105 showing that , for a given temperature , there are in general three possible values of @xmath10 .",
    "thus we obtain up to three different branches of our hairy black hole solution .",
    "we start our analysis with a relatively large value of the coupling constant @xmath0 , namely @xmath99 and calculate the horizon radius , temperature and euclidean action for various values of @xmath98 . in figure",
    "[ mass_action_q3 ] , left panel , we depict @xmath98 versus @xmath106 and it is clear that there is a @xmath106 interval for which there are really three corresponding values for @xmath102 outside this interval , there is just one solution .",
    "the corresponding graph for the euclidean actions may be seen in the right panel of the same figure .",
    "the action for the topological black hole with the common temperature @xmath106 is represented by a continuous line , while the actions for the hairy black holes are shown in the form of points .",
    "we note that equation ( [ ftbh ] ) yields for the temperature of the topological black hole @xmath107 the largest euclidean action ( smallest free energy ) will dominate .",
    "there are three branches for the hairy black hole , corresponding to the three different values of @xmath102 in particular , for some fixed temperature ( e.g. , @xmath108 ) the algebraically lowest @xmath98 corresponds to the algebraically lowest euclidean action ; similarly , the medium and largest @xmath98 parameters correspond to the medium and largest euclidean actions .",
    "the medium euclidean action for the hairy black hole is very close to the euclidean action for the topological black hole .",
    "in fact , it is slightly smaller than the latter for @xmath109 and slightly larger after that value .",
    "if it were the only branch present , one would thus conclude that the hairy black hole dominates for small temperatures , while for large temperatures the topological black hole would be preferred .",
    "this would be a situation similar to the one of the mtz black hole .",
    "however , the two additional branches change completely our conclusions .",
    "the upper branch shows that the hairy black hole dominates up to @xmath110 when the coupling constant @xmath0 decreases , equation ( [ tm3 ] ) along with the demand that the temperature should be positive , show that the acceptable values of @xmath98 are two rather than three , as may be seen in figure [ mass_action_q00005 ] , left panel .",
    "the lowest branch of the previous corresponding figure [ mass_action_q3 ] shrinks for decreasing @xmath0 and it finally disappears .",
    "an interesting consequence of this is that the temperature has an upper limit .",
    "the graph for the euclidean actions ( figure [ mass_action_q00005 ] , right panel ) is influenced accordingly .",
    "there are just two branches for the hairy black hole , rather than three in figure [ mass_action_q3 ] and the figure ends on its right hand side at @xmath111 the continuous line represents the euclidean action for the topological black hole with the same temperature .",
    "similar remarks hold as in the previous case , e.g. , the phase transition moves to @xmath112 in addition , the largest value of @xmath98 corresponds to the upper branch of the hairy black hole .    to understand the nature of this phase transition it is instructive to draw a kind of phase diagram , so that we can spot which is the dominant solution for a given pair of @xmath0 and @xmath113 we depict our result in figure [ phd ] .",
    "the hairy solution dominates below the curve which shows the critical temperature as a function of the coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "the most striking feature of the graph is that the critical temperature diverges as @xmath2 .",
    "thus , it does not converge to the mtz value @xmath114 at @xmath1 . for even the slightest nonzero values of @xmath0",
    "the critical temperature gets extremely large values !",
    "this appears to put the conformal point ( mtz black hole ) in a special status within the set of these hairy black holes . in other words ,",
    "the restoration of conformal invariance is not a smooth process , and the mtz black hole solution can not be obtained in a continuous way as @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , it seems that ( even infitesimally ) away from the conformal point @xmath1 black holes are mostly hairy !",
    "to perform the stability analysis of the hairy black hole it is more convenient to work in the einstein frame .",
    "henceforth , we shall work in units in which the radius of the boundary is @xmath95 .",
    "we begin with the hairy black hole line element , @xmath116 , \\ee which can be written in the form \\begin{equation } ds^{2}=-\\frac{f_0}{h_0^{2}}dt^{2}+\\frac{dr^{2}}{f_0}+r^{2}d\\sigma^{2}\\ ] ] using the definitions f_0(r ) = f ( ) ( 1 + ) ^2  , + h_0(r ) = ( 1 + )  , under the change of coordinates r=^3/2(+2r_0)^1/2+r_0  . the scalar field solution reads _ 0 ( r ) = ^-1  , obeying the boundary conditions ( [ eqbcphi ] ) with [ eqxc ] = _ 0 = |r_0|  .",
    "we are interested in figuring out when the black hole is unstable ( losing its hair to turn into a tbh ) and discuss the results in the context of thermodynamic considerations . to this end",

    "if it does not , then there is no instability of this type ( however , one should be careful with non - perturbative instabilities ) .    in figure [ stable_q0_q00005 ] ( left panel )",
    "we show the ratio @xmath125 for the standard mtz black hole ( corresponding to @xmath1 ) versus @xmath127 at a typical value of the mass parameter , namely @xmath128 it is obvious that the value of the ratio lies well below the values @xmath129 it is clearly impossible to have a solution to this equation , so the solution is stable .",
    "in fact this value of the mass parameter lies in the interesting range for this black hole , since thermodynamics dictates that for negative values of @xmath98 mtz black holes are favored against topological black holes .",
