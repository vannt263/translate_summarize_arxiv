    "recently , the authors @xcite studied the inelastic light - scattering intensity of a semi - infinite superconducting superlattice with a bilayer basis . motivated by the cooper pair tunneling model proposed by chakravarty , anderson , and coworkers @xcite for high @xmath3 layered superconductors , we discussed the in - phase and out - of - phase phase modes ( corresponding to the phase fluctuations of the two superconducting order parameters in a bilayer ) which arise in the presence of interlayer cooper pair tunneling @xcite .",
    "these modes couple into density fluctuations and , as a result , show up in the raman inelastic light scattering .",
    "the intensity is weak because of screening associated with the coulomb interaction , and in fact is below the threshold of current raman experiments .",
    "however , our results are of sufficient interest that such experiments should be attempted . in this paper , we extend our previous calculations @xcite and show how the raman spectrum for @xmath4 is significantly modified when we include the surface contribution .",
    "it is also the first time surface plasmons ( which occurs above @xmath0 ) are included in the calculation of the raman intensity of layered superconductors .",
    "the present paper is based on the approach of jain and allen @xcite , who considered normal layered electron gas ( leg ) . in their calculation for a semi - infinite superlattice , both the bulk and surface contributions were included .",
    "they found that there were two effects of the surface : ( 1 ) van hove singularities at the upper and lower limits of the bulk plasmon band were completely canceled out by negative surface contributions .",
    "( 2 ) depending on the background dielectric constants , surface plasmons @xcite can appear , either above or below the bulk plasmon band .",
    "we show that the analogous effects arise in a semi - infinite _ superconducting _ superlattice , resulting in major modifications of the bulk contribution to the raman scattering spectrum given in ref .",
    "apart from the out - of - phase phase mode contribution , the raman scattering intensity is found to be strongly dependent on the value of momentum transfer @xmath1 ( parallel to the layers ) .",
    "for simplicity , we only discuss the surface effects for a superlattice with a single layer per unit cell .",
    "this is sufficient to understand the essential physics .",
    "the isotropic inelastic light - scattering cross section is given by @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 here @xmath7 represents the position of the @xmath8-th layer in the @xmath9-th unit cell .",
    "the density response function @xmath10 in ( [ eq : intensity ] ) has been evaluated in ref  @xcite and represents the correlation between the charge density on layer @xmath11 and the charge density on layer @xmath12 .",
    "the incident photon has momentum @xmath13 , energy @xmath14 , and polarization @xmath15 and the scattered photon is similarly described by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the energy transfer @xmath19 in ( [ eq : intensity ] ) is very small compared to the photon frequencies , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath20 .",

    ", we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the momentum carried by the incident photon and @xmath26 describes the damping of the photons in the medium . the result given in ( [ eq : intensity ] ) shows that as a result of the finite value of @xmath26 , the inelastic light - scattering cross section involves a _ weighted _ sum of the correlation functions for electronic densities in the different layers .",
    "we are interested in the interplay between the bulk and surface contributions to the raman spectra . for this purpose",

    "the additional two ( van hove ) singularities given by the solutions of @xmath50 correspond to the upper ( @xmath51 ) and lower ( @xmath52 ) limits of the `` bulk plasmon '' band for an _ infinite _ superlattice @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the second term in ( [ eq : i.2 ] ) only has a single pole given by @xmath53 corresponding to out - of - phase phase mode discussed in detail in ref .  @xcite . because the unit cell summation is over many bilayers ,",

    "this implies that the in - phase phase modes given by @xmath48 and @xmath50 have less weight when @xmath1 is small , an expected consequence of the screening due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "in contrast , even in the low-@xmath1 limit , @xmath61 is still finite , being proportional to the pair tunneling strength @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the out - of - phase phase mode given by @xmath62 has a weight proportional to @xmath63 and is not too dependent on the value of @xmath1 ( in the range probed in raman scattering experiments ) .",

    "we have also found that the bulk plasmon mode in the region @xmath138 ceases to be well - defined when @xmath1 reaches a critical value ( @xmath139 for the parameters we have used ) .",
