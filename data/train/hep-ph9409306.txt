    "with the discovery of heavy quark symmetry ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , it has become clear that the study of exclusive semileptonic @xmath1 decays close to zero recoil allows for a reliable determination of the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa matrix element @xmath7 , which is free , to a large extent , of hadronic uncertainties @xcite@xcite .",
    "model dependence enters this analysis only at the level of power corrections , which are suppressed by a factor of at least @xmath8 .",
    "these corrections can be investigated in a systematic way using the heavy quark effective theory @xcite .",
    "they are found to be small , of the order of a few per cent .    until recently ,",
    "this method to determine @xmath0 was limited by large experimental uncertainties of about 1520% , which were much larger than the theoretical uncertainties in the analysis of symmetry - breaking corrections . however , three collaborations have now presented results of higher precision @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is thus important to reconsider the status of the theoretical analysis , even more so since the original calculation of power corrections in ref .",
    "@xcite has become the subject of controversy @xcite .",
    "the differential decay rate for the process @xmath9 is given by @xcite @xmath10\\,|\\,v_{cb}|^2\\,\\eta_a^2\\,\\widehat\\xi^{\\,2}(w ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the product of the meson velocities .",
    "i have factorized the hadronic form factor for this decay into a short - distance coefficient @xmath12 and a function @xmath3 , which contains the long - distance hadronic dynamics . apart from corrections of order @xmath13",
    ", this function coincides with the isgur  wise form factor @xcite .",
    "luke s theorem determines the normalization of @xmath3 at zero recoil ( @xmath14 ) up to second - order power corrections @xcite : @xmath15 the strategy is to obtain the product @xmath16 from a measurement of the differential decay rate , and to extrapolate it to @xmath14 to extract @xmath17 the task of theorists is to provide a reliable calculation of @xmath12 and @xmath18 in order to turn this measurement into a precise determination of @xmath0 .",
    "the short - distance coefficient @xmath12 takes into account a finite renormalization of the axial vector current in the region @xmath19 .",
    "its calculation is a straightforward application of qcd perturbation theory . at the one - loop order",
    ", one finds @xcite @xmath20 the scale of the running coupling constant is not determined at this order .",
    "choosing @xmath21 between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and using @xmath24 , one obtains values in the range @xmath25 .",
    "the scale ambiguity leads to an uncertainty of order @xmath26 ^ 2\\sim 2\\%$ ] .",
    "the calculation can be improved by using the renormalization group to resum the leading and next - to - leading logarithms of the type @xmath27^n$ ] , @xmath28^n$ ] , and @xmath29^n$ ] to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "a consistent scheme for a next - to - leading - order calculation of @xmath30 has been developed in ref .",
    "the result is @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the numerical result is very stable under changes of the input parameters . for @xmath34 gev ( for 4 flavours ) and @xmath24 , one obtains @xmath35 .",
    "the uncertainty arising from next - to - next - to - leading corrections is of order @xmath36 . taking this into account ,",
    "i think it is conservative to increase the error by a factor 2.5 and quote @xmath37",
    "hadronic uncertainties enter the determination of @xmath0 at the level of second - order power corrections , which are expected to be of order @xmath38 . for a precision measurement , it is important to understand the structure of these corrections in detail .",
    "falk and myself have derived the exact expression @xcite @xmath39 which depends upon five hadronic parameters : @xmath40 and @xmath41 parametrize the deficit in the `` wave - function overlap '' between @xmath42- and @xmath43-flavoured pseudoscalar ( _ p _ ) and vector ( _ v _ ) mesons , for instance @xmath44 the parameter @xmath45 is proportional to the kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside a heavy meson , @xmath46 gev@xmath47 is determined by the vector ",
    "pseudoscalar mass splitting , and @xmath48 parametrizes certain matrix elements containing double insertions of the chromo - magnetic operator . with the exception of @xmath49 , estimates of these parameters",
    "are model - dependent . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we made the simplifying assumptions that @xmath50 , and that the corrections represented by @xmath48 are negligible .",
    "the latter one is based on the observation that these corrections involve a double insertion of an operator that breaks the heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "using then reasonable values such as @xmath51 gev@xmath47 and @xmath52  gev@xmath47 , one obtains @xmath53 . here and in the following ,",
    "i take @xmath54 gev and @xmath55 gev for the heavy quark masses . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the error in the estimate of @xmath18 has been increased to @xmath56 in order to account for the model dependence and higher - order corrections .",
    "a very similar result , @xmath57 , has been obtained by mannel @xcite .",
    "recently , shifman _",
    "et al_.  have suggested an alternative approach to obtain an estimate of @xmath18 , which is based on bounds derived using sum rules and the operator product expansion @xcite .",
    "these bounds imply the inequalities @xmath58 the upper bound for @xmath18 implies that @xmath59 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this number is quoted as 0.94 . in the same reference , the authors give an `` educated guess '' @xmath60 corresponding to @xmath61 .",
    "however , the arguments presented to support this guess are not very rigorous .",
    "it is possible to combine the above approaches to reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use the sum rules to constrain the hadronic parameters in ( [ delm2 ] ) in a threefold way : ( i )  the first relation in ( [ sumruls ] ) implies that @xmath62 excluding some of the values for the parameter @xmath63 used in previous analyses .",
    "( ii )  comparing the third relation in ( [ sumruls ] ) with ( [ delm2 ] ) in the limit @xmath64 , one finds that @xmath65 ( iii ) finally , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are correlated in such a way that @xmath66 if @xmath48 is not too large . to illustrate this last point ,",
    "let me define new parameters @xmath67 in terms of these , @xmath68 using the inequalities ( [ sumruls ] ) , one can show that @xmath69 and @xmath70 , with @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "there are thus three effects , which decrease @xmath18 with respect to the estimate given in ref .",
    "@xcite : a large value of @xmath73 , a positive value of @xmath48 , and the fact that for small @xmath48 the difference @xmath74 is centred around @xmath75 ( i.e.  @xmath76 is centred around 0 ) .",
    "= 9.5 cm    in evaluating ( [ final ] ) , i will take @xmath77 gev@xmath47 , which is consistent with the bound in ( [ lam1bou ] ) and with the value @xmath78 gev@xmath47 obtained from qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "varying @xmath79 in the range between 0.36 and 0.5 gev@xmath47 does not alter the results very much .",
    "the main uncertainty comes from the unknown values of the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath48 . as a guideline",
    ", one may employ the constituent quark model of isgur _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , in which one uses non - relativistic harmonic oscillator wave functions for the ground - state heavy mesons , for instance @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the reduced mass .",
    "one then obtains @xmath83 gev@xmath47 , where i use @xmath84 gev for the light constituent quark mass .",
    "however , this estimate of @xmath80 is probably somewhat too low .",
    "lattice studies of heavy - light wave functions suggest an exponential behaviour of the form @xmath85 @xcite , which leads to @xmath86 gev@xmath47 .",
    "values much larger than this are unlikely , since i use a rather large constituent quark mass @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , adopting the point of view that the sum rules for @xmath40 and @xmath41 are saturated to approximately 50% by the ground - state contribution @xcite , one would expect @xmath88 gev@xmath47 , which seems a very reasonable value to me . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , i show the allowed regions for @xmath18 as a function of @xmath48 for two values of @xmath80 .",
    "i think it is reasonable to assume that @xmath48 is of a magnitude similar to @xmath49 or smaller .",
    "thus , i conclude that for all reasonable choices of parameters the results are in the range @xmath89 which is consistent with the previous estimates in refs .",
    "@xcite at the @xmath90 level",
    ". a more precise determination of the parameter @xmath80 would help to reduce the uncertainty in this number .",
    "in the extrapolation of the differential decay rate ( [ bdrate ] ) to zero recoil , the slope of the function @xmath3 close to @xmath14 plays an important role . one defines a parameter @xmath91 by @xmath92 it is important to distinguish @xmath91 from the slope parameter @xmath93 of the isgur  wise function .",
    "they differ by corrections that break the heavy quark symmetry . whereas the slope of the isgur  wise function is a universal , mass - independent parameter , the slope of the physical form factor depends on logarithms and inverse powers of the heavy quark masses . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath91 is an observable quantity , while the value of @xmath93 depends on the renormalization scheme . to illustrate this last point ,",
    "let me neglect for the moment @xmath13 corrections and work in the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "then the relation between the physical slope parameter @xmath91 and the slope parameter @xmath94 of the regularized isgur ",
    "wise function is @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the renormalization scale , and @xmath97 is an undetermined ( at this order ) scale between @xmath98 and @xmath99 . the last equation can be used to define the @xmath96-independent slope of the renormalized isgur  wise function ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the generalization of this definition to next - to - leading order ) . if next - to - leading logarithmic corrections are taken into account , the scale ambiguity related to the choice of @xmath97 is resolved , and one obtains @xmath100 the @xmath13 corrections to this relation have been investigated and are found to be negative . however , any such estimate is model - dependent and thus has a large theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the result is @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "predictions for the renormalized slope parameter @xmath93 are available from qcd sum rules including a next - to - leading - order renormalization - group improvement .",
    "one obtains @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "i thus expect @xmath103",
    "using the updated values @xmath104 and @xmath105 , i obtain for the normalization of the hadronic form factor at zero recoil : @xmath106 three experiments have recently presented new measurements of the product @xmath107 . when rescaled using the new lifetime values @xmath108",
    "ps and @xmath109 ps @xcite , the results obtained from a linear fit to the data are @xmath110 where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "i will follow the suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite and add @xmath111 to these values to account for the curvature of the function @xmath3 . taking the weighted average of the experimental results and using the theoretical prediction ( [ etaxi ] ) ,",
    "i then obtain @xmath112 which corresponds to a model - independent measurement of @xmath0 with 7% accuracy .",
    "this is by far the most accurate determination to date .    neglecting @xmath13 corrections ,",
    "i have related the physical slope parameter @xmath91 to the slope of the isgur  wise function and obtain the prediction @xmath4 .",
    "it compares well with the average value observed by experiments , which is @xmath113 @xcite@xcite .",
