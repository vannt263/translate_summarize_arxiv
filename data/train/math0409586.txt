    "we define a closed @xmath4-dimensional _ piecewise manifold _ ( henceforth abbreviated to p - manifold ) to be a topological space which has a natural stratification into pieces which are manifolds .",
    "more precisely , we define a @xmath5-dimensional p - manifold to be a finite graph .",
    "an @xmath4-dimensional p - manifold ( @xmath6 ) is defined inductively as a closed pair @xmath7 satisfying the following conditions :    * each connected component of @xmath8 is either an @xmath9-dimensional p - manifold , or an @xmath9-dimensional manifold . * the closure of each connected component of @xmath10 is homeomorphic to a compact orientable @xmath4-manifold with boundary , and the homeomorphism takes the component of @xmath10 to the interior of the @xmath4-manifold ; the closure of such a component will be called a _",
    "chamber_.    denoting closure of the connected components of @xmath10 by @xmath11 , we observe that we have a natural map @xmath12 from the disjoint union of the boundary components of the chambers to the subspace @xmath8 .",
    "we also require this map to be surjective , and a homeomorphism when restricted to each component .",
    "the p - manifold is said to be _ thick _ provided that each point in @xmath8 has at least three pre - images under @xmath13 .",
    "we will henceforth use a superscript @xmath14 to refer to an @xmath4-dimensional p - manifold , and will reserve the use of subscripts @xmath15 to refer to the lower dimensional strata . for a thick @xmath4-dimensional p - manifold , we will call the @xmath8 strata the _ branching locus _ of the p - manifold .    intuitively , we can think of p - manifolds as being `` built '' by gluing manifolds with boundary together along lower dimensional pieces .",
    "examples of p - manifolds include finite graphs and soap bubble clusters .",
    "observe that compact manifolds can also be viewed as ( non - thick ) p - manifolds .",
    "less trivial examples can be constructed more or less arbitrarily by finding families of manifolds with homeomorphic boundary and glueing them together along the boundary using arbitrary homeomorphisms .",
    "we now define the family of metrics we are interested in .",
    "a riemannian metric on a 1-dimensional p - manifold ( finite graph ) is merely a length function on the edge set .",
    "a riemannian metric on an @xmath4-dimensional p - manifold @xmath14 is obtained by first building a riemannian metric on the @xmath8 subspace , then picking , for each chamber @xmath11 a riemannian metric with totally geodesic boundary satisfying that the gluing map @xmath13 is an isometry .",
    "we say that a riemannian metric on a p - manifold is hyperbolic if at each step , the metric on each @xmath11 is hyperbolic .",
    "a hyperbolic p - manifold @xmath14 is automatically a locally @xmath0 space ( see chapter ii.11 in bridson - haefliger [ 5 ] .",
    "furthermore , the lower dimensional strata @xmath16 are all totally geodesic subspaces of @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the universal cover @xmath17 of a hyperbolic p - manifold @xmath14 is a @xmath0 space ( so is automatically @xmath18-hyperbolic ) , and has a well - defined boundary at infinity @xmath19 .",
    "finally we note that the fundamental group @xmath20 is a @xmath18-hyperbolic group .",
    "we also note that examples of hyperbolic p - manifolds are easy to obtain . in dimension two ,",
    "for instance , one can take multiple copies of a compact hyperbolic manifold with totally geodesic boundary , and identify the boundaries together . in higher dimension , one can similarly use the arithmetic constructions of hyperbolic manifolds ( see borel - harish - chandra [ 2 ] ) to find hyperbolic manifolds with isometric totally geodesic boundaries . gluing multiple copies of these together along their boundaries yield examples of hyperbolic p - manifolds .",
    "more complicated examples can be constructed by finding isometric codimension one totally geodesic submanifolds in _ distinct _ hyperbolic manifolds . once again , cutting the manifolds along the totally geodesic submanifolds yield hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundary , which we can glue together to build hyperbolic p - manifolds ( see the construction of non - arithmetic lattices by gromov - piatetski - shapiro [ 9 ] ) .    we say that an @xmath4-dimensional p - manifold @xmath14 is _ simple _ provided its codimension two strata is empty . in other words , the @xmath9-dimensional strata @xmath8 consists of a disjoint union of @xmath9-dimensional manifolds .    an illustration of a simple , thick p - manifold is given in figure 1 .",
    "it has four chambers , and two connected components in the codimension one strata .",
    "we point out that p - manifolds show up naturally in the setting of branched coverings . starting from a hyperbolic manifold @xmath21",
    ", one can take a totally geodesic codimension two subspace @xmath22 , with the property that @xmath23 bounds a codimension one totally geodesic subspace @xmath24 .",
    "one could look at a ramified cover @xmath25 of @xmath21 , of degree @xmath26 , where the ramification is over @xmath23 .",
    "this naturally inherits a ( singular ) cat(-1 ) metric from the metric on @xmath21 ( note that gromov - thurston [ 10 ] have shown that , when @xmath26 is sufficiently large , it is possible to smooth this singular metric to a negatively curved riemannian metric ) .",
    "the pre - image @xmath27 of the subspace @xmath28 will be a simple hyperbolic p - manifold , isometrically embedded in @xmath25 ( with respect to the singular metric ) .",
    "the codimension one strata in @xmath29 will consist of a single connected component , isometric to @xmath23 , and there will be @xmath26 chambers , each isometric to @xmath24 .",
    "we also point out that related spaces include hyperbolic buildings .",
    "indeed , these share the property that they are naturally stratified spaces , built out of pieces that are isometric to subsets of hyperbolic space .",
    "the difference lies in that for hyperbolic buildings , the boundary of the chambers are not totally geodesic in the space .",
    "hyperbolic buildings have been studied by bourdon - pajot [ 4 ] ; they obtain quasi - isometric rigidity for some 2-dimensional hyperbolic buildings ( compare to our theorem 1.3 ) .",
    "note that , unlike hyperbolic p - manifolds , hyperbolic buildings can only exist in low dimensions ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this follows from a result of vinberg [ 21 ] , showing that compact coxeter polyhedra do not exist in hyperbolic spaces of dimension @xmath31 .",
    "since the existence of such polyhedra is a pre - requisite for the existence of hyperbolic buildings , vinberg s result immediately implies the desired non - existence result .",
    "next we introduce a locally defined topological invariant .",
    "we use @xmath32 to denote a closed @xmath4-dimensional disk , and @xmath33 to denote its interior .",
    "we also use @xmath34 to denote a closed interval , and @xmath35 for its interior .",
    "define the 1-_tripod _ @xmath36 to be the topological space obtained by taking the join of a one point set with a three point set .",
    "denote by @xmath37 the point in @xmath36 corresponding to the one point set .",
    "we define the @xmath4-_tripod _ ( @xmath6 ) to be the space @xmath38 , and call the subset @xmath39 the _ spine _ of the tripod @xmath40 .",
    "the subset @xmath41 separates @xmath40 into three open sets , which we call the _ open leaves _ of the tripod .",
    "the union of an open leaf with the spine will be called a _ closed leaf _ of the spine .",
    "we say that a point @xmath42 in a topological space @xmath29 is _ @xmath4-branching _ provided there is a topological embedding @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "it is clear that the property of being @xmath4-branching is invariant under homeomorphisms .",
    "we show some examples of branching in figure 2 .",
    "note that , in a simple , thick p - manifold of dimension @xmath4 , points in the codimension one strata are automatically @xmath4-branching .",
    "one can ask whether this property can be detected at the level of the boundary at infinity . this motivates the following :        * conjecture : * let @xmath14 be a simple , thick hyperbolic p - manifold of dimension @xmath4 , and let @xmath42 be a point in the boundary at infinity of @xmath17 .",
    "then @xmath42 is @xmath9-branching if and only if @xmath45 for some geodesic ray @xmath46 contained entirely in a connected lift of @xmath8 .",
    "one direction of the above conjecture is easy to prove ( see proposition 2.1 ) . in the case",
    "where @xmath47 , we will see that the reverse implication also holds .",
    "note that in general , the ( local ) topological structure of the boundary at infinity of a @xmath0 space ( or of a @xmath18-hyperbolic group ) is very hard to analyze .",
    "the conjecture above says that with respect to branching , the boundary of a simple , thick hyperbolic p - manifold of dimension @xmath4 is particularly easy to understand .    in our proofs",
    ", we will make use of a family of nice metrics on the boundary at infinity of an arbitrary @xmath4-dimensional hyperbolic p - manifold ( in fact , on the boundary at infinity of any cat(-1 ) space ) .",
    "given an @xmath4-dimensional hyperbolic p - manifold , and a basepoint @xmath37 in @xmath17 , we can define a metric on the boundary at infinity by setting @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the unique geodesic joining the points @xmath50 ( and @xmath51 denotes the distance inside @xmath52 ) .    the fact that @xmath53 is a metric on the boundary at infinity of a proper @xmath0 space follows from bourdon ( section 2.5 in [ 3 ] ) .",
    "note that changing the basepoint from @xmath37 to @xmath54 changes the metric , but that for any @xmath55 , we have the inequalities : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and the subscripts on the @xmath53 refers to the choice of basepoint used in defining the metric . in particular , different choices for the basepoint induce the same topology on @xmath58 , and this topology coincides with the standard topology on @xmath59 ( the quotient topology inherited from the compact - open topology in the definition of @xmath60 as equivalence classes of geodesic rays in @xmath17 ) .",
    "this gives us the freedom to select basepoints at our convenience when looking for _ topological _ properties of the boundary at infinity .",
    "we will start by proving the following :    let @xmath1 be a simple , thick hyperbolic p - manifold of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "then a point @xmath61 is @xmath62-branching if and only if there is a geodesic ray @xmath63 in a lift of the @xmath62-dimensional strata , with the property that @xmath64 .",
    "this theorem has immediate applications , in that it allows us to show several rigidity results for simple , thick hyperbolic p - manifolds of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "the first application is a version of mostow rigidity .",
    "let @xmath65 be a pair of simple , thick hyperbolic p - manifolds of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "assume that the fundamental groups of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are isomorphic .",
    "then the two p - manifolds are in fact isometric ( and the isometry induces the isomorphism of fundamental groups ) .",
    "this is proved in subsection 3.1 , but the idea of the proof is fairly straightforward : one uses the isomorphism of fundamental groups @xmath68 to induce a homeomorphism @xmath69 between the boundaries at infinity of the respective universal covers .",
    "theorem 1.1 implies that the subsets of the @xmath70 corresponding to the lifts of the branching loci are homeomorphically identified .",
    "a separation argument ensures that the boundaries of the various chambers are likewise identified .",
    "one then uses the dynamics of the @xmath71 actions on the @xmath70 to ensure that corresponding chambers have the same fundamental groups .",
    "mostow rigidity for hyperbolic manifolds with boundary allows us to conclude that , in the quotient , the corresponding chambers are isometric .",
    "finally , the dynamics also allows us to identify the gluings between the various chambers , yielding the theorem .    as a second application",
    ", we consider groups which are quasi - isometric to the fundamental group of a simple , thick hyperbolic p - manifold of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "we obtain :    let @xmath29 be a simple , thick hyperbolic p - manifold of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath72 be a group quasi - isometric to @xmath73 .",
    "then there exists a short exact sequence of the form : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a finite group , and @xmath76 is a subgroup of the isometry group of @xmath77 with @xmath78 compact .    here",
    "our argument relies on showing that any quasi - isometry of the corresponding p - manifold is in fact a bounded distance from an isometry .",
    "the key idea is that ( by theorem 1.1 ) any quasi - isometry is bounded distance from a quasi - isometry which preserves the chambers . for compact hyperbolic manifolds",
    "_ with totally geodesic boundary _ , a `` folklore theorem '' states that quasi - isometries of the universal cover are a bounded distance from isometries ( note that the corresponding statement for _ closed _ hyperbolic manifolds is _ false _ ) ; see the footnote on pg .",
    "648 in kapovich - kleiner [ 12 ] . assuming this result ( whose proof we sketch out in section 3.2 )",
    ", we then show that the bounded distance isometries can glue together to give a global isometry which is still at a bounded distance from the original quasi - isometry .",
    "from such a statement , standard methods yield a quasi - isometry classification .",
    "in this section , we provide a proof of theorem 1.1 .",
    "we start by noting that one direction of the conjecture stated in the introduction is easy to prove :    let @xmath14 a simple , thick @xmath4-dimensional p - manifold , and let @xmath42 be a point in the boundary at infinity of @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath46 is a geodesic ray contained entirely in a connected lift @xmath79 of @xmath8 , then @xmath80 is @xmath9-branching .",
    "this is easy to show : by the thickness hypothesis , there are at least three distinct chambers @xmath81 containing @xmath79 in their closure . for each of these chambers",
    ", we can consider the various boundary components of @xmath81 .",
    "to each boundary component distinct from @xmath79 , we can again use the thickness hypothesis to find chambers incident to each of the boundary components . extending this procedure",
    ", we see that we can find three totally geodesic subset in @xmath17 glued together along the codimension one strata @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , the simplicity assumption implies that @xmath79 is isometric to @xmath82 , while each of the three totally geodesic subsets is isometric to a `` half '' @xmath83 .",
    "this implies that , in the boundary at infinity , there are three embedded disks @xmath84 glued along their boundary to @xmath85 .",
    "it is now immediate that @xmath86 is @xmath9-branching .    for the reverse implication",
    ", we will need a strong form of the jordan separation theorem .",
    "the proof of this theorem is the only place where the condition @xmath47 is used .",
    "let @xmath87 be a continuous map , and let @xmath88 be the set of injective points ( i.e. points @xmath89 with the property that @xmath90 ) .",
    "if @xmath91 contains an open set @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , then :    * @xmath94 separates @xmath95 into open subsets ( we write @xmath96 as a disjoint union @xmath97 , with each @xmath98 open ) , * there are precisely two open subsets @xmath99 , @xmath100 in the complement of @xmath94 which contain @xmath101 in their closure . *",
    "if @xmath102 is an extension of the map @xmath103 to the closed ball , then @xmath104 surjects onto either @xmath99 or @xmath100 .    before starting with the proof , we note that this theorem clearly generalizes the classical jordan separation theorem in the plane ( corresponding to the case @xmath105 ) .",
    "the author does not know whether the hypotheses on @xmath91 can be weakened to just assuming that @xmath91 is measurable .",
    "we start out by noting that the map @xmath94 can not surject onto @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath91 is assumed to contain an open set , we can find an @xmath106 , i.e. a ( small ) interval on which @xmath103 is injective . since @xmath103 is injective on @xmath34 , one can find a small closed ball in @xmath95 with the property that the ball intersects @xmath94 in a subset of @xmath107 .",
    "but an imbedding of a 1-dimensional space into a 2-dimensional space has an image which must have zero measure , so in particular , there is a point in the closed ball that is not in the image of @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath103 is not surjective , we use stereographic projection to view @xmath103 as a map into @xmath108 . a well known theorem ( which is a consequence of the @xmath62-dimensional schoenflies theorem ) now tells us that , given any embedded arc in the plane , there is a homeomorphism of the plane taking the arc to a subinterval of the @xmath109-axis ( this follows for instance from theorem iii.6.b in bing [ 1 ] ) . applying this homeomorphism",
    "we can assume that @xmath103 maps the interval @xmath34 to the @xmath109-axis .",
    "now let @xmath110 be a pair of points lying slightly above and slightly below the image @xmath111 .",
    "if the points @xmath112 are close enough to the @xmath109-axis , we can find a path @xmath113 which intersects the @xmath111 transversaly in a single point , joins @xmath114 to @xmath115 , and has no other intersection with @xmath94 .",
    "now perturb the map @xmath103 , away from @xmath111 , so that it is pl .",
    "if the perturbation is slight enough , the new map @xmath116 will be homotopic to @xmath103 in the complement of the @xmath112 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath113 will intersect the map @xmath116 transversaly in precisely one point .",
    "it is now classical that the map @xmath116 must represent distinct elements in @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( and in fact , that the integers it represents differ by one ) . since @xmath116 is homotopic to @xmath103 in the complement of the @xmath112 , the same holds for the map @xmath103 . in particular , the connected components in @xmath119 containing @xmath114 and @xmath115",
    "are distinct , giving the first two claims .",
    "furthermore , @xmath103 represents a non - zero class in one of the @xmath120 , giving us the third claim .",
    "note that geodesic rays @xmath46 which are not asymptotic to a ray contained in a lift of the branching locus are of one of two types :    * either @xmath46 eventually stays trapped in a @xmath81 , and is not asymptotic to any boundary component , or *",
    "@xmath46 passes through infinitely many connected lifts @xmath81 .    in the next proposition",
    ", we deal with the first of these two cases .",
    "let us first introduce some notation .",
    "given a point @xmath121 , we denote by @xmath122 the geodesic projection from the boundary onto the link at the point @xmath109 . recall that the _ link _ of a point in a piece - wise hyperbolic cat(-1 ) space is a small metric sphere of radius @xmath123 centered at the point . if @xmath123 is small enough , the link is unique upto homeomorphism .",
    "we denote by @xmath124 the set @xmath125 , in other words , the set of points in the link where the projection map is actually injective .",
    "the importance of this set lies in that it consists of those directions ( points in the boundary ) where injectivity can be detected _ from the point @xmath109_.    let @xmath1 be a simple , thick 3-dimensional hyperbolic p - manifold .",
    "let @xmath126 be a geodesic ray lying entirely within a connected lift @xmath127 of a chamber @xmath24 , and not asymptotic to any boundary component of @xmath127 .",
    "then @xmath86 is * not * 2-branching .",
    "we start by observing that , by our hypothesis , we can take any @xmath128 as a basepoint , and @xmath129 will lie within @xmath124 ( since by hypothesis @xmath46 lies entirely within @xmath81 ) .",
    "now assume , by way of contradiction , that @xmath130 is 2-branching .",
    "then we have an injective map @xmath131 such that @xmath132 .",
    "consider the composite map @xmath133 into the link at @xmath109 . since @xmath109 lies in a chamber , we have @xmath134 .",
    "now note that the composite map @xmath135 must be injective on the set @xmath136 .",
    "indeed , by the definition of @xmath124 , those are the points @xmath42 in @xmath137 which have a unique pre - image under @xmath138 . hence ,",
    "if the composite map @xmath135 has _ more _ than one pre - image at such a point @xmath42 , it would force the map @xmath103 to have two distinct pre - images at @xmath139 , which violates our assumption that @xmath103 is injective .    in order to get a contradiction",
    ", we plan on showing that the composite map fails to be injective at some point in the set @xmath124 .",
    "we start with a few observations on the structure of the set @xmath124 .",
    "the complement of @xmath124 has the following properties :    * it consists of a countable union of _ open _ disks @xmath98 in @xmath95 , * the @xmath98 are the interiors of a family of pairwise disjoint closed disks , * the @xmath98 are dense in @xmath95 .",
    "if @xmath138 fails to be injective at a point @xmath140 , then there are two distinct geodesic rays emanating from @xmath109 , in the direction @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath109 lies within a chamber these two geodesic rays must agree up until some point , and then diverge .",
    "this forces these geodesic rays to intersect the branching locus .",
    "this immediately tells us that the set @xmath124 is the projection of @xmath141 onto the link . note that this is a homeomorphism , and",
    "since @xmath141 is a sierpinski carpet , we immediately get all three claims .",
    "since the point @xmath142 lies in @xmath143 , we would like to get some further information about the density of the @xmath98 away from the set @xmath144 .",
    "for any point @xmath145 , and any neighborhood @xmath146 of @xmath42 , there exist arbitrarily small @xmath98 with @xmath147 .",
    "by density of the @xmath98 , we have that for any point @xmath148 , arbitrarily small neighborhoods of @xmath42 must intersect an open disk . to see that arbitrary small neighborhoods actually _ contain _ an open @xmath98 , we consider the standard measure @xmath149 on the sphere ( identified with the link ) . note that since the measure of the sphere is finite , for any @xmath150 there are at most finitely many @xmath98 with @xmath151 . since the union of the boundaries of these @xmath98 form a closed subset of @xmath95 , and this subset does not contain @xmath42 ( since we assumed @xmath152 ) , we have that the distance from @xmath42 to the boundaries of these @xmath98 is positive .    in particular , for an arbitrary neighborhood @xmath146 of @xmath42 , and an arbitrary @xmath150 , we can find a smaller neighborhood @xmath153 with the property that any @xmath98 intersecting @xmath154 satisfies @xmath155 .",
    "however , since the @xmath98 are actually _ round _ disks in @xmath95 , we have that @xmath156 ( for some uniform constant @xmath157 ) , which gives us control of @xmath158 in terms of @xmath159 .",
    "so in particular , picking @xmath154 much smaller than @xmath146 , we can force @xmath158 to be much smaller than the distance from @xmath154 to the boundary of @xmath146 .",
    "hence @xmath147 , completing the claim .",
    "the image @xmath160 is a bounded distance away from @xmath129 .",
    "first of all , observe that the boundary @xmath161 of the set @xmath162 is compact , forcing @xmath163 to be compact .",
    "since @xmath103 is injective by hypothesis , we must have @xmath164 , yielding @xmath165 as we know that @xmath142 lies in the injectivity set @xmath124 .",
    "hence the minimal distance between @xmath166 and @xmath167 is positive .",
    "now recall that we need to find a point in @xmath124 where the composite map @xmath168 fails to be injective . to do this ,",
    "we start by observing the following :    the image of the spine is entirely contained in @xmath124 ( i.e. @xmath169 ) .",
    "heuristically , the idea is that if the claim was false , one would find a @xmath98 intersecting the image of the spine .",
    "the pre - image of the boundary of this @xmath98 would look like a tripod @xmath36 within the space @xmath162 ( see figure 3 ) . but @xmath170 lies within the set @xmath124 , so its pre - image should be homeomorphic to a subset of @xmath171 .",
    "we argue by contradiction . if not , then there exists a point @xmath172 with the property that @xmath173 .",
    "this implies that @xmath174 lies in one of the open disks @xmath98 .",
    "note that we already have a point @xmath175 whose image lies in @xmath176 .     which intersects the spine.,width=336 ]",
    "now consider the pre - image @xmath177 of @xmath170 .",
    "let @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) be the three closed leaves of the tripod , and consider the intersection @xmath180 .",
    "the set @xmath181 is the pre - image of @xmath170 for the restriction of the map to the union @xmath182 , hence must separate @xmath42 and @xmath174 .",
    "@xmath181 is a closed subset of @xmath183 , and since @xmath184 , @xmath181 must be homeomorphic to a closed subset of @xmath185 .",
    "this implies that @xmath181 consists of either a union of intervals , or of a single @xmath171 .",
    "we first note that @xmath181 _ can not _ be an @xmath171 , for then @xmath181 would have to equal @xmath177 ( since the map is injective on @xmath170 ) .",
    "one could then take a path in the third leaf joining @xmath42 to @xmath174 , contradicting the fact that @xmath177 separates .",
    "so we are left with dealing with the case where @xmath181 is a union of intervals .",
    "now let @xmath186 be a subinterval that separates @xmath42 from @xmath174 .",

    "let @xmath337 , @xmath338 be the various connected lifts of the branching locus .",
    "theorem 1.1 tells us that we have the equalities @xmath339 , @xmath340 .",

    "the next claim is that if a lift of a chamber @xmath349 corresponds to a lift of a chamber @xmath350 , that they are in fact isometric . to see this",
    ", we consider the chamber @xmath351,@xmath352 whose lifts we are dealing with , and note that they have isomorphic fundamental groups . indeed , consider the action of the fundamental groups of the two p - manifolds on their boundary at infinity .",
    "then the fundamental group of a chamber @xmath11 can be identified with the stabilizer of @xmath81 for the action of @xmath353 as deck transformations .",

    "to see this , we note that the stabilizer of @xmath81 will clearly stabilize @xmath355 .",
    "conversely , assume that we have a non - trivial element @xmath356 in @xmath73 which stabilizes @xmath355 .",
    "note that , the @xmath229 must be permuted by any isometry , and from lemma 2.1 they separate @xmath77 into the various lifts of chambers .",

    "note that if @xmath356 stabilizes @xmath357 , then so do all its powers .",
    "since @xmath356 acts hyperbolically on the boundary at infinity , this implies that the sink / source of the @xmath356 action lies in the set @xmath355 .",

    "equivariance of the homeomorphism ensures that the corresponding image groups get identified in precisely the same way , which implies that the corresponding lifts of the chambers are glued together in an equivariant , isometric manner .",

    "it is clear from our construction that the isometry we obtain induces the original isomorphism between the fundamental groups .",
    "we point out two immediate ( and standard ) corollaries :    let @xmath1 be a simple , thick hyperbolic p - manifold of dimension @xmath2 , @xmath72 its fundamental group . then the outer automorphism group @xmath372 is a finite group , isomorphic to @xmath373 ( the isometry group of the p - manifold ) .",

    "now let @xmath374 consist of those groups which arise as the fundamental group of a simple , thick hyperbolic p - manifold of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "note that every group in @xmath375 arises as the fundamental group of a graph of groups , induced by the decomposition of the p - manifold into its chambers ( see serre [ 19 ] for definitions ) .",
    "furthermore , the gluings between the chambers are encoded in the morphisms attached to each edge in the graph of groups .",
    "a purely group theoretic reformulation of mostow rigidity is the following :    let @xmath376 be groups in @xmath374 . then @xmath377 if and",
    "only if there is an isomorphism between the underlying graph of groups with the property that :    * the isomorphism takes vertex groups to isomorphic vertex groups , * isomorphisms can be chosen between the vertex groups which intertwine all the edge morphisms .",

    ", we will use the following well known result ( for a proof , see proposition 3.1 in farb [ 6 ] ) :    let @xmath29 be a proper geodesic metric space , and assume that every quasi - isometry from @xmath29 to itself is in fact a bounded distance from an isometry .",
    "furthermore , assume that a finitely generated group @xmath378 is quasi - isometric to @xmath29 .",
    "then there exists a cocompact lattice @xmath379 , and a finite group @xmath75 which fit into a short exact sequence : @xmath380    so to prove the theorem , it is sufficient to show that any quasi - isometry of a simple , thick p - manifold of dimension @xmath2 is a bounded distance away from an isometry . in order to do this",
    ", we begin by recalling a well known `` folklore '' result .",
    "proofs of this have been given at various times by farb , kapovich , kleiner , leeb , schwarz , wilkinson , and others , though no published proof exists ( both b. kleiner and b. farb were kind enough to e - mail us their arguments , which we sketch out below ) .",
    "let @xmath381 be a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold with totally geodesic boundary ( non - empty ) .",
    "then any quasi - isometry of the universal cover @xmath382 is a finite distance from an isometry .",
    "the idea of the argument is to repeatedly reflect @xmath382 through the totally geodesic boundary components to get a copy of @xmath383 , tiled by copies of @xmath382 . now given a quasi - isometry of the original @xmath382 , we can extend to a quasi - isometry of all of @xmath383 , which has the special property that it preserves the union of the boundaries ( as sets ) .",
    "this quasi - isometry extends to a quasi - conformal homeomorphism of the boundary @xmath95 that interchanges certain families of @xmath171 ( the points at infinity corresponding to the various boundaries ) .",
    "using the fact that this homeomorphism preserves a family of circles containing nested circles of arbitrarily small size , one shows that the quasi - conformal homeomorphism is in fact conformal .",
    "this implies that there is an isometry of @xmath383 which is bounded distance from the original quasi - isometry .",
    "furthermore , by construction , this isometry preserves our original @xmath384 .    now assuming the preceding folklore theorem , we proceed to give a proof of theorem 1.3 :",
    "let us start by showing our first claim : that any quasi - isometry of the universal cover @xmath77 of a simple , thick p - manifold @xmath29 of dimension @xmath2 lies a finite distance away from an isometry .",
    "notice that our quasi - isometry induces a self - homeomorphism of the boundary at infinity @xmath385 .",
    "once again , theorem 1.1 implies that the induced map on the boundary at infinity acts as a permutation on the set of boundaries of connected lifts of the branching locus .",
    "in particular , this forces our quasi - isometry to map each of the branching strata @xmath229 _ inside _ the p - manifold to within finite distance of another branching strata , call it @xmath386 .",
    "since under a quasi - isometry we have uniform control of the distance between the images of geodesics and actual geodesics , we see that there is a uniform upper bound on the distance between the image of @xmath229 and the strata @xmath386 . as such , we can modify our quasi - isometry by projecting the images of each @xmath229 to the corresponding @xmath386 . since this projection only moves points by a bounded distance , we have that the new map is still a quasi - isometry , and is bounded distance from the one we started with .",
    "so we have now reduced to the case where the quasi - isometry maps each @xmath229 into the corresponding @xmath386 . since",
    "our induced homeomorphism on the boundary also permutes the boundaries of the @xmath81 , we can apply the same projection argument to ensure that our new quasi - isometry actually maps each @xmath81 strictly into a corresponding @xmath387 .",
    "let us denote this new quasi - isometry by @xmath103 .",
    "now proposition 3.1 forces @xmath388 , and the restriction of our quasi - isometry @xmath103 to @xmath81 is a bounded distance from an isometry @xmath389 .",
    "furthermore , as in our proof of mostow rigidity , a separation argument ensures that incidence of the chambers @xmath81,@xmath230 forces the corresponding chambers @xmath387 and @xmath390 to be incident .",
    "we now want to get a global isometry from the isometries on chambers .",
    "observe that , for an incident pair of chambers @xmath81 and @xmath230 , we can consider the branching strata @xmath391 .",
    "the image of this map under @xmath103 is @xmath392 .",
    "furthermore , we have a pair of isometries @xmath393 from @xmath391 to @xmath394 , each of which is a finite distance from the map @xmath103 , so in particular , which must be a finite distance from each other .",
    "considering the isometry @xmath395 , we obtain an isometry of @xmath391 which is bounded distance from the identity .",
    "but the only isometry of @xmath396 which is bounded distance from the identity is the identity itself .",
    "this allows us to conclude that @xmath397 and @xmath398 are exactly the same isometry when restricted to @xmath391 , allowing us to glue them together .",
    "since this holds for arbitrary incident chambers , we can combine all the various isometries into a globally defined isometry on @xmath77 .",
    "we are left with showing that the resulting isometry is a bounded distance from the original quasi - isometry .",
    "note that , for the time being , we only know that on each lift of a _ chamber _ @xmath81 the isometry is bounded distance @xmath399 from an isometry .",
    "we still need to deal with the possibility that the individual @xmath399 might be tending to infinity .",
    "this prompts the question : given that a @xmath400-quasi - isometry is a bounded distance from an isometry , can we obtain a _ uniform _ upper bound on how large this distance can get ? we need to obtain a uniform bound for quasi - isometries of the universal cover of compact hyperbolic manifolds with ( non - empty ) totally geodesic boundary .    in order to answer this , we recall that , for an arbitrary @xmath400 quasi - isometry @xmath103 on a @xmath401 space @xmath127 ( @xmath402 ) , there is a uniform constant @xmath403 ( depending solely on the constants @xmath404 ) with the following property .",
    "given any bi - infinite geodesic @xmath46 , the distance between the image @xmath405 ( which is referred to as a _ quasi - geodesic _ ) and the bi - infinite geodesic with endpoints @xmath406 is bounded above by @xmath212 .",
    "naturally , if the quasi - isometry is bounded distance from an isometry @xmath407 , then the latter geodesic is precisely @xmath408 .",
    "now let us assume that we are dealing with a space with the property that every point has a pair of perpendicular bi - infinite geodesics @xmath409 intersecting precisely in @xmath42 .",
    "we will abbreviate this property to saying that a space has ( pbig ) . then for our isometry",
    ", we see that @xmath410 , while for our quasi - isometry we only obtain @xmath411 . since @xmath412 lies in the @xmath212 neighborhood of @xmath413 , we see that @xmath414 lies in the intersection of the @xmath212-neighborhoods of a pair of intersecting geodesics , which , since @xmath407 is an isometry , are in fact perpendicular geodesics . but",
    "such a neighborhood has a diameter that is uniformly bounded by some constant @xmath415 which only depends on @xmath212 ( and hence on @xmath404 ) .",
    "note that the spaces we are interested in are universal covers of compact hyperbolic manifolds with non - empty boundary , so it is not clear that the above property holds .",
    "it is easy to see that every point is contained in a bi - infinite geodesic , but it is less clear that one can find two such geodesics which are perpendicular .",
    "for the spaces we are considering , we now make the :    * assertion : * there exists a constant @xmath416 with the property that if @xmath46 is an inextendable geodesic , then @xmath417 .    assuming this assertion , it is easy to obtain the upper bound we desire .",
    "indeed , every point in @xmath127 is the intersection of a pair of perpendicular inextendable geodesics @xmath418 ( which either terminate at the boundary , or extend off to infinity ) . the same argument",
    "as before shows that @xmath414 must lie in the intersection of the @xmath416 neighborhoods of @xmath419 and @xmath420 , giving uniform control of @xmath421    to see that the desired assertion is true , we note that we only have to deal with geodesic segments with both endpoints on boundary components , or geodesic rays emanating from a boundary component ( the case of bi - infinite geodesics having been discussed above ) .",
    "now note that , since the boundary components have the property ( pbig ) ( indeed , they are totally geodesic @xmath396 s ) , we have that for points @xmath174 on the boundary components , @xmath422 .",
    "if @xmath46 is a geodesic segment with both endpoints @xmath423 on boundary components , then we have that @xmath424 , where @xmath113 is the geodesic joining @xmath425 to @xmath426 .",
    "however , we also have that @xmath427 , so by convexity of the distance function @xmath428 , where @xmath429 is the geodesic joining @xmath430 to @xmath431 . but that geodesic is precisely @xmath408 , so the triangle inequality yields @xmath432 , giving the desired upper bound for this case .",
    "the case of a geodesic ray with endpoint on a boundary component follows from an identical argument .",
    "we conclude that we have the desired uniform bound , which implies that our gluing of the ` piecewise ' isometries is still a bounded distance from an isometry .",
    "now a consequence of every quasi - isometry being finite distance from an isometry is that any group @xmath378 quasi - isometric to @xmath433 must fit into a short exact sequence : @xmath380 where @xmath75 is a finite group and @xmath434 ( see lemma 3.1 ) .",
    "the theorem follows .",
    "for other recent results on the quasi - isometry behavior of graphs of groups , we refer to papasoglu [ 14 ] , papasoglu - whyte [ 15 ] , and mosher - sageev - whyte [ 13 ] .",
    "we note that the only place in our arguments where we use the assumption that @xmath47 is in the proof of the strong jordan separation theorem . more specifically , we make use of the fact that the schoenflies theorem holds in dimension @xmath62 .",
    "of course , this approach fails in higher dimension , as there are examples of wild embeddings of spheres in all dimensions @xmath435 .",
    "nevertheless , we still believe that the conjecture put forth in the introduction holds true ( and in fact , that the strong jordan separation theorem also holds in higher dimension )",
    ".    a more general question would be to determine which hyperbolic p - manifolds exhibit rigidity .",
    "one would need some sort of hypotheses , as the following example shows :    * example : * let @xmath16 ( @xmath201 ) be simple , thick , hyperbolic p - manifolds of dimension @xmath2 . in each @xmath16 , let @xmath436 be one of the surfaces in the @xmath62-dimensional strata , and let @xmath437 be a simple closed geodesic in each @xmath438 .",
    "we now propose to build a thick , hyperbolic p - manifold which is _ not _ rigid .",
    "let @xmath378 be a complete graph on four vertices , and @xmath439 be three triangles in @xmath378 .",
    "assign a length to each edge in such a way that the triangles @xmath439 have length equal to the corresponding @xmath440 .",
    "note that given isometries from @xmath440 to @xmath439 , we can form a thick , hyperbolic p - manifold by gluing the @xmath16 to @xmath378 by identifying the @xmath440 with the @xmath439 .",
    "furthermore , as long as the gluing isometries are homotopic , the resulting p - manifolds will all have isomorphic fundamental group .",
    "so provided we can find two different gluings which yield non - isometric p - manifolds , we will have exhibited non - rigidity .",
    "to do this , fix the gluing of @xmath329 , @xmath441 , and ` rotate ' the gluing map for the @xmath328 .",
    "note that , in the surface @xmath341 , there are countably many geodesic segments which are perpendicular to @xmath442 and intersect @xmath443 precisely at their endpoints . by rotating the gluing map suitably , we can ensure that one of the resulting p - manifolds has such a geodesic segment in @xmath341 emanating from a vertex of the triangle @xmath444 , whereas another one of the resulting p - manifolds does not .",
    "it is now clear that these two p - manifolds can not be isometric , despite the fact that they have isomorphic fundamental groups .",
    "observe that these examples will have a non - trivial one - dimensional strata ( namely the graph @xmath378 ) , so do not satisfy the simplicity hypothesis of this paper .    note that if there is no 1-dimensional strata , one can not use the ` rotation trick ' to get counterexamples ( since the isometry group of compact hyperbolic manifolds is finite if the dimension is at least two ) .",
    "perhaps the following is reasonable :    * question : * is every hyperbolic p - manifold with empty 1-dimensional strata mostow rigid ?",
    "other interesting questions arise from trying to further understand the ( full ) group of isometries @xmath445 of the universal cover of a hyperbolic p - manifold @xmath29 .",
    "these groups will be discrete , and exhibit behavior which one would expect to be between that of tree lattices ( particularly if all the chambers are isometric ) , and that of lattices in @xmath446 .    finally , we point out that we can define _ negatively curved _ p - manifolds by allowing metrics of negative curvature ( with totally geodesic boundary ) on each chamber . in this",
    "setting , the proof of proposition 2.2 still holds ( with appropriate modifications in the argument for claim 2 ) , and while there is no hope of a mostow type rigidity , one can still consider the quasi - isometry question for the resulting groups .",
    "the main stumbling point lies in the ( 3-dimensional case of the ) following :    * question : * let @xmath447 be a compact , negatively curved , @xmath4-dimensional manifold with non - empty , totally geodesic boundary , and let @xmath448 be it s universal cover with the induced metric .",
