    "the invariant vanishes on the commutator group , which is a subgroup of @xmath29 generated by commutators @xmath34 , where @xmath5 and @xmath35 run over @xmath29 .    in this paper , we establish the following properties of the commutator group of the group of interval exchange transformations @xmath29 .",

    "a new result of the present paper is that the commutator group of @xmath23 is generated by elements of order @xmath0 .",
