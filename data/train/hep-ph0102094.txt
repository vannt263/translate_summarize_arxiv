    ", two 3-branes sit at the orbifold fixed points @xmath42 ( plank brane ) and @xmath43 ( sm or tev brane ) with equal and opposite tensions with the ads@xmath41 space between them .",
    "the model contains no large parameter hierarchies with @xmath44 , the 5-d planck scale , @xmath45 , and the ads curvature parameter , @xmath46 , being of qualitatively similar magnitudes .",
    "tev scales can be generated on the brane at @xmath43 if gravity is localized on the other brane and @xmath47 ; indeed in this case the scale of physical processes on the sm brane is found to be given by @xmath48 which is of order a tev .",
    "such a model leads to very interesting and predictive phenomenology that can be explored in detail at colliders@xcite . in the simplest scenario",
    "the sm fields are constrained to lie on the tev brane while gravitons can propagate in the bulk in which case only two parameters are necessary to describe the model : @xmath49 , which is expected to be near though somewhat less than unity , and @xmath50 , which is the mass of the first graviton kaluza - klein excitation .",
    "the masses of the higher excitations are given by @xmath51 , where the @xmath52 are roots of the bessel function @xmath53 , and are thus not equally spaced .",
    "while the massless zero mode graviton couples in the usual manner as @xmath54 , the tower states instead couple as @xmath55",
    ". the most distinctive prediction of this scenario is the direct production of weak scale graviton resonances at colliders as is shown in fig .  1 for the case of a linear collider .",
    "note that for fixed mass the width of each resonance is proportional to @xmath56 ; for resonances beyond the first kk excitation , the width grows as @xmath57 .",
    "this explains why resonances with large kk number tend to get smeared out into a continuum .",
    "present searches for graviton resonances at the tevatron as well as analyses of their indirect contributions to electroweak observables already place significant constraints on the @xmath58 plane . when combined with our theoretical prejudices the complete allowed region for the rs model is shown in fig .  1 in comparison to the reach of the lhc .",
    "even given some fuzziness in our prejudices it is apparent that the lhc should cover the entire rs parameter space either by discovering a graviton resonance or excluding the model .",
    "if the sm gauge fields alone are allowed to propagate in the bulk then it can be shown that the gauge kk excitations couple much more strongly to the remaining wall fields than do the zero modes@xcite by a factor @xmath59 .",
    "the exchange and mixing of these modes contribute to the electroweak observables and result in a bound @xmath60 tev which is perhaps too high to claim a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "this strong bound can be alleviated by also placing the sm fermions in the bulk as well with the higgs field remaining on the wall for a number of technical reasons@xcite . for simplicity and to avoid fcnc we assume that all sm fermions have an identical 5-d mass @xmath61 , with @xmath62 a parameter of order unity .",

    "the general situation , in which the lorentz group is gauged as well , will give rise to an antisymmetric part to the connection coefficient , the torsion tensor .",
    "this general situation obtains in the presence of intrinsic spin ; the torsion tensor is then coupled to the intrinsic spin current , which then represents yet another source of gravity . since this current can not be eliminated by a choice of coordinates , the situation breaks the strong form of the equivalence principle .",

    "the future collider experiments may either discover the kaluza - klein ( kk ) states of the standard model fields or raise their mass limits significantly .",
    "there may also be some other light bound states which could be observed at upcoming collider experiments . compared with the usual four - dimensional dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) models , the higher - dimensional model has the advantage that the binding force can be the sm gauge interactions themselves , without the need of introducing new strong interactions .",
    "in addition , it also gives a prediction of the top quark mass naturally in the right range . in the minimal four - dimensional top quark condensate model ,",
    "the top quark is too heavy , @xmath86 gev , if the compositeness scale is in the tev range . with extra dimensions ,",
    "the kk excitations of the top quark also participate in the ewsb , so the top quark mass can be smaller .",
    "another way of understanding of the top yukawa coupling being @xmath87 instead of the strong coupling value @xmath88 is that ( the zero mode of ) the top quark coupling receives a volume dilution factor because it propagates in extra dimensions .",
    "in fact , the top quark mass can be predicted quite insensitively to the cutoff because of the infrared fixed point behavior of the renormalization group ( rg ) evaluation . the infrared fixed point",
    "is rapidly approached due to the power - law running in extra - dimensional theories . even though the cutoff scale is not much higher the the weak scale .",
    "similarly , the higgs self - coupling also receives the extra - dimensional volume suppression . as a result",

    "it is also governed by the infrared fixed point of the rg equations .",
