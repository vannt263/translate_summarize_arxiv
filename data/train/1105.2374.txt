    "the phenomenon of multiple fragmentation of relativistic nuclei can serve as a source of coherent ensembles of the lightest nuclei and nucleons . in this respect",
    "only nuclear track emulsion providing 0.5  @xmath4 m spacial resolution allow one to follow tracks of all relativistic fragments in forward cone defined by a nucleon fermi motion .",
    "the most peripheral collisions accompanied by neither blacknor graytracks of target nucleus fragments are few percents among inelastic interactions @xcite .",
    "they are referred to as the whitestars what also aptly reflects the short drop of ionization from primary to secondary tracks .",
    "such events occur as a result of electromagnetic and nuclear diffraction on heavy nuclei of emulsion composition ( i.e. , ag and br ) .",
    "minimal perturbation of a projectile make them the most valuable sample for nuclear cluster physics .",
    "excitation energy of a fragment ensemble is estimated as q = m@xmath5-m , where m@xmath5 is the ensemble invariant mass and m - a projectile mass .",
    "the value m@xmath5 is defined as m@xmath6 = ( @xmath7p@xmath8)@xmath9=@xmath7(p@xmath10p@xmath11 ) , where p@xmath12 are 4-momenta of the fragments .",
    "assumption of projectile speed conservation by relativistic fragments is sufficient to compensate the lack of momentum measurements .",
    "already it is established that final states of relativistic he fragments effectively correlate with the clustering in the nuclei @xmath13c @xcite , @xmath14li @xcite , and @xmath15be @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the described approach is used in the becquerel project @xcite to study the dripline nuclei @xmath16be @xcite , @xmath17b @xcite , @xmath15c @xcite , @xmath0c @xcite , and @xmath13n @xcite by means emulsion stacks exposed to secondary beams of the jinr nuclotron @xcite .",

    "example of such event is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the channel he+4h is found to be suppressed ( 16 events ) since it has higher threshold for an @xmath1-cluster break up .",
    "the core role of the unbound @xmath20be nucleus in the @xmath0c structure is manifested in intensive fragmentation via @xmath0c@xmath3be+2p .",
    "distribution of @xmath1-pairs in the 156 whitestars 2@xmath1 + 2p on the excitation energy q@xmath21 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ]  a. in 63 events the q@xmath21 value does not exceed 1 mev ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ]  a ) . for them , the average value is @xmath2263@xmath2330  kev and the mean - square scattering @xmath24=83  kev , which agrees well with the decay of the @xmath20be 0@xmath25 ground state .",
    "the @xmath20be 0@xmath25 contribution is approximately the same as for the neighboring cluster nuclei @xcite , @xcite",
    ".    the unbound @xmath26b nucleus can be another major product of the @xmath0c coherent dissociation .",
    "[ fig:2 ]  b shows the distribution of whitestars 2@xmath1 + 2p on the excitation energy q@xmath27 , defined by the difference of the invariant mass of the three fragments 2@xmath1+p and the mass of the proton and the doubled @xmath1-particle masses .",

    "there is a clear correlation in the @xmath20be and @xmath26b production .",
    "one can note the formation of a single event 2@xmath1 + 2p with q@xmath27 equal to the values 0.23 and 0.15  mev , i.e. , at the same time both triples correspond to the decay of the nucleus @xmath26b ( fig .",

    "there is no clear signal of @xmath31be decays .",
    "to conclude , contribution of @xmath20be nuclei is about one - third in ralativistic @xmath0c dissociation .",
    "the production of @xmath20be nuclei shows strong correlation with cascade decay @xmath0c @xmath2b@xmath3be .",
    "there is no significant contribution of decays @xmath20be@xmath182@xmath1 through the first excited state 2@xmath25 , which differs qualitatively the @xmath0c and @xmath26be nuclei @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it can be assumed that the @xmath20be 2@xmath25 state does not contribute to the ground state of the @xmath0c nucleus , and its core is formed of the 0@xmath25 state .",
    "paired protons can have the meaning of a covalent pair in the @xmath0c molecular - like system with two - center potential @xmath1 + 2p+@xmath1 .",
