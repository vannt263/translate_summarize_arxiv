    "@xcite moreover , a very recent study  @xcite gave an interpretation where the current across qcl s is entirely coherent .",
    "in addition to the studies concentrated on qcl s , there is a mounting theoretical evidence for the presence of quantum coherence features in linear absorption spectra and nonlinear ultrafast optical response for intersubband transitions in unbiased quantum wells ( qw s ) .",
    "@xcite    furthermore , experimental interest in the qcl performance in a magnetic field stimulated theoretical efforts to describe the influence of magnetic field on the physical processes involved .",

    "@xcite apart from the work done on qcl s in a magnetic field , a few theoretical investigations of qw systems subjected to a magnetic field , based on both the density matrix and nonequilibrium green s function approaches , have been reported , and confirmed the importance of quantum coherence effects on the ultrafast time scales .",
    "@xcite    currently , no experimental or theoretical data on coherent phenomena in qcl s in a magnetic field are available . since the energy spectra in such structures is discrete , it is reasonable to expect that coherent effects are more significant than for qcl s without magnetic field .",

    "@xcite scattering and dephasing processes are then restricted only to energy conserving transitions between single - particle states . for discrete energy spectra in qw s in a magnetic field ,",
    "the electron - lo phonon interaction is thus almost fully suppressed , if broadening is not taken into account .",

    "obviously , the calculation of population and polarization dynamics for the qcl s with many energy states and ll s stemming from them is extremely challenging .",
    "therefore , in our analysis , we restrict to the case of a qcl with a small number of energy levels per period , and subjected to relatively large magnetic fields , characterized by a small number of ll s stemming from those levels which are relevant for the transport . here",
