    "future colliders in the tev energy regime will attempt to clarify the physics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking . in this context",
    "it is important to understand the radiative corrections from qcd as well as from the electroweak standard model ( sm ) sufficiently in order to disentangle new physics effects . for precision measurements in the percentile regime ,",
    "higher order _ electroweak _ radiative corrections are crucial for this purpose @xcite",
    ".    the exponentiation of electroweak double logarithms ( dl ) @xcite has now been established by independent two loop calculations in the fermionic sector @xcite and therefore , using group theoretical arguments and the equivalence theorem , also in the longitudinal sector as was first derived in ref .",
    "@xcite via the infrared evolution equation method .    for universal , i.e. process independent subleading ( sl ) logarithms ,",
    "the identity of the splitting function approach and the physical fields calculation was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite at the one loop level . in ref .",
    "@xcite general formulae were presented for arbitrary dl and sl corrections at one loop including process dependent angular terms .",
    "the importance of these latter corrections was also discussed at one loop in ref .",
    "@xcite . at higher orders , these corrections are important and",
    "were first given for massless four fermion processes in ref .",
    "for this particular group of processes even sub - subleading corrections have been calculated by employing qcd results and subtracting the qed corrections from the sm @xcite . in both cases",
    "the effects of higher order subleading terms are large and need to be included in a consistent treatment .    in this paper , we are interested in calculating the angular dependent corrections to sl accuracy to all orders for arbitrary electroweak processes .",
    "these include fermion mass terms and the associated ckm mixing effects ( which are absent for massless quarks since they are automatically mass eigenstates ) , other mixing and mass gap effects of the electroweak gauge bosons and the longitudinal sector .",
    "we assume that all invariants @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the gauge boson mass with @xmath3 .",
    "although we can not directly use the framework of qcd for the sm , at high energies we can use a description based on the symmetric basis in which all terms with a mass dimension are neglected @xcite .",
    "this formulation implies for instance in the neutral scalar sector that the relevant fields are @xmath4 and @xmath5 . while strictly speaking we are calculating corrections to amplitudes with these fields ,",
    "the translation to the mass eigenstates is for the most part straightforward . in our example",
    "we have the relations @xmath6 thus , the corrections factorize analogously for the mass eigenstates . only in the neutral transverse sector",
    "we can not directly assign a well defined isospin . in this case , and for corrections involving gauge bosons only , we have to consider only the amplitude involving the non - abelian field @xmath7 since the mixing contribution with the @xmath8 field does not possess self interactions .",
    "the contributions from the regime below the scale @xmath2 are due only to qed and can be incorporated via the appropriate matching conditions in the framework of the infrared evolution equation method @xcite .    in section [ sec : ga ] we give general two loop arguments leading up to a factorization in operator form for the angular dependent corrections in the physical basis . in section [ sec : adc ] the results of section [ sec : ga ] are generalized in the framework of the infrared evolution equation method based on the lagrangian in the symmetric basis and matching at the weak scale . in section",
    "[ sec : comp ] , the results in the effective description are compared at one loop with results in the physical basis in order to clarify the method , and to the massless limit for four fermion processes also at higher orders .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "our general strategy in the following is to investigate if spontaneous symmetry breaking effects can lead to novel angular dependent sl - corrections in comparison to the known contributions in massless unbroken gauge theories at two loop order .",
    "as discussed below , the results from the latter are used as input in our factorization for the electroweak angular dependent corrections .    in the sm ,",
    "the novel effects arising due to the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism are the mixing of the mass eigenstates , the existence of a scalar sector ( which is not mass suppressed at high energies ) and the mass gap of the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "in addition to a massless non - abelian theory there are massive particles and in practice , these mass terms regularize collinear divergences and are important for phenomenological predictions for future colliders .",
    "the effect of mixing is important for photon and z - boson final states , since an external @xmath9-boson at one loop mixes with the photon field for instance .",
    "however , these mixing terms are not related to angular dependent corrections and are discussed in more detail in refs .",
    "a new complication is in principle given by the ckm - matrix elements , which enter in the couplings of massive quarks to the charged gauge bosons . for universal corrections , using the conservation of the non - abelian group charge , these terms are of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 . for the exchange of the heavy gauge bosons ,",
    "the mass terms only lead to additional mass suppressed contributions if @xmath12 .",
    "the unitarity of the ckm matrix implies that the mass independent term in @xmath13 leads to the unit matrix . for the general case with",
    "angular dependent corrections fermion mass terms remain , including in principle independent ckm matrix elements , and thus , we have to convince ourselves that at the @xmath14-loop level to sl accuracy no new @xmath15 arise from the ckm terms , where @xmath16 denotes an invariant depending on the angle between the incoming and the outgoing particle for instance .",
    "these terms are discussed below but it should be noted that a massless calculation would not serve as a check of these corrections since in this case they are automatically mass eigenstates . for other final states ,",
    "the mixing effects above the scale @xmath2 correspond to a change of basis , namely the symmetric basis , and therefore do not give rise to new effects for physical cross sections .    the new ingredient in spontaneously broken gauge theories are the mass terms .",
    "in the case of the sm , the corrections from below the weak scale are only due to qed and the angular sl terms in particular are only due to photon exchange .",
    "thus , at the two loop level , we have to consider corrections of the type depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : qedang ] and show that the mass terms do not lead to new effects compared to those in the massless case .",
    "the two scalar integrals of fig .",
    "[ fig : qedang ] , regularized with a fictitious photon mass @xmath17 , are given in massive qed by @xmath18 denoting @xmath19 , @xmath20 and where the @xmath21 are the masses of the external charged particles on their mass shell .",
    "thus , it is straightforward to see that the sum of the two diagrams factorizes to leading order : @xmath22 the omitted cross term @xmath23 leads only to corrections containing three logarithms at the two loop level .",
    "it is thus on the same level as the approximation in the beginning of our discussion which only considers scalar integrals and can therefore be neglected . to dl accuracy",

    "the required factorized form shown there for the virtual diagrams , is actually a consequence of the type of fermion mass singular terms which occur in the associated real emission diagrams shown in the lower half of fig .",
    "[ fig : ckm ] . the diagrams ii@xmath29 and",
    "ii@xmath30 do not produce fermion mass singular terms due to the virtuality ( @xmath31 ) of the line emitting the photon ( wavy line ) .",
    "thus , only the real emission diagrams in the last row remain which are of the required factorized form .",
    "the connection between the real and virtual diagrams is now provided by the kln theorem @xcite .",
    "it states that , as a consequence of unitarity , transition probabilities are free of mass singularities when summed over all degenerate final states . this is true order by order in perturbation theory in renormalization schemes which do not introduce mass singular terms via the renormalization constants . as mentioned above",
    ", we are not concerned about the last point here .    thus , the only way to cancel the real emission fermion mass singularities in fig .",

    "thus , whether we consider fundamental fermions or scalars charged under the unbroken gauge group leads to the same form of factorized corrections .    a more serious problem , in principle , is given by the mass gap of the gauge bosons , since there could be novel soft angular corrections compared to the equal mass case .",
    "this , however , is not the case since the soft angular terms from virtual scattering amplitudes in the full sm are fixed by the pure real qed corrections in the regime where the experimental energy resolution @xmath33 is below the weak scale @xmath2 .",
    "this energy cut provides a well defined observable in the sm without the inclusion of real heavy gauge boson emission . since the real qed corrections are always proportional to @xmath34 at one loop , and exponentiates at higher orders , the infrared finiteness of observable cross sections fixes the type of soft virtual angular corrections to that of pure qed effects .",

    "@xcite and subsequently confirmed by explicit two loop calculations in refs .",

    "it uses mass regulators for the soft and collinear divergences . to sl accuracy in qed , one loop results calculated in this mass regulator scheme",
    "determine the corresponding two loop logarithmic corrections .",
    "also in the general case , a main feature of the factorization formula at the two loop level is that - up to terms corresponding to higher order running coupling terms - all leading and subleading pole terms are determined by the one loop divergences in color space .",
    "the latter was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite and serves as a convenient way to incorporate soft color correlations in qcd scattering amplitudes .",
    "these are novel effects in non - abelian gauge theories and need to be properly included .    in the electroweak theory ,",
