    "these expression are valid for all frequencies smaller than the width of the gap , where the mass - gap parameter makes a major impact on the reflectivities , and also for frequencies exceeding the width of the gap ( the latter under a condition that they are much smaller than the thermal frequency ) .",
    "the obtained expressions have been applied to calculate an impact of the mass - gap parameter on the reflectivity of graphene - coated sio@xmath0 plates at the normal incidence at different temperatures .",
    "it is shown that at fixed frequency the reflectivity of graphene - coated plates decreases with increasing mass - gap parameter .",
    "calculations show that for a wider gap the reflectivity begins its decreasing from unity to the reflectivity of an uncoated sio@xmath0 plate at lower frequency . for the gap width @xmath89=0.02 ev at @xmath129=300k the reflectivities of plates coated with gapped and gapless graphene",
    "are shown to be rather close . at the same time",
    ", the reflectivity of sio@xmath0 plate coated with gapped graphene with @xmath89=0.2 ev may be smaller by up to a factor of 8 than the reflectivity of a plate coated with gapless graphene .",
    "qualitatively the dependences of reflectivities on frequency are akin in the cases of graphene coatings with different values of the mass - gap parameter and a gapless graphene coating at different temperatures .",
    "the dependence of a reflectivity on the quasiparticle mass @xmath6 is also computed over the wide range of @xmath130 from @xmath131 mev to 100 mev at different temperatures .    furthermore , the obtained expressions have been used to calculate the angle dependences of the tm and te reflectivities of sio@xmath0 and si plates coated with gapped graphene with different values of the mass - gap parameter .",
    "it was shown that the tm reflectivity has a minimum value at some incidence angle @xmath110 , which depends on the mass - gap parameter of graphene coating .",
    "these minimum values , however , are always larger than zero .",
    "thus , the reflected light from a plate coated with gapped graphene can not be fully polarized .",
    "this is different from the coating with a gapless graphene where the full ( te ) polarization of reflected light is possible at high frequencies .",
    "we have also calculated the dependence of an angle @xmath110 on the mass - gap parameter for both sio@xmath0 and si plates at different temperatures .",
    "it is shown that @xmath110 decreases with increasing mass - gap parameter and that the limiting values of @xmath110 at large @xmath6 do not depend on the temperature , but only on the plate material .",
    "the above results demonstrate that a nonzero gap of graphene has profound effects on the optical properties of graphene - coated dielectric plates , which should be taken into account in numerous applications , such as the optical detectors , solar cells , optoelectronic switches and others mentioned in sec .",
    "i. in sec .",
    "i it was also discussed that a nonzero gap arises under the influence of different factors including the defects of structure or impurities .",
    "a more full account of the role of impurities can be made by considering nonzero chemical potential .",
    "a rough estimate @xcite shows that the above results obtained for zero chemical potential can be valid for the concentration of impurities below @xmath132 . in this respect further generalization of the developed formalism , e.g. , for the case of graphene coatings with nonzero chemical potential",
    "@xcite is of interest for future work .",
