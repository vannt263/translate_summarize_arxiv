    "clustering is a generic phenomenon which can appear in homogeneous matter when density decreases ; the formation of galaxies as well as the disintegration of hot dilute heavy nuclei into lighter nuclei are extreme examples occuring in nature .",
    "as far as nuclear physics is concerned , the nucleus viewed as a collection of @xmath2-particles was very early discussed and in the last forty years both theoretical and experimental efforts were devoted to clustering phenomena in nuclei .",
    "very recently the formation of @xmath2-particle clustering from excited expanding self - conjugate nuclei was revealed in two different constrained self consistent mean field calculations  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work was to obtain , from the experimental side , some information on @xmath2-particle clustering from excited and consequently expanding alpha - conjugate nuclei .",
    "the chosen experimental strategy was to use the reaction @xmath0ca+@xmath1c at an incident energy ( 25 mev per nucleon ) sufficient to possibly produce some hot expanding reaction products , associated with a high granularity - high solid angle particle array ( to precisely reconstruct directions of velocity vectors ) .",
    "then , by selecting the appropriate reaction mechanism and specific events the required information was derived .",
    "the experiment was performed at infn , laboratori nazionali del sud in catania , italy .",
    "the beam impinging on a thin carbon target ( 320 @xmath6g/@xmath7 ) was delivered by the superconducting cyclotron and the charged reaction products were detected by the chimera 4@xmath8 multi - detector  @xcite .",
    "the beam intensity was kept around @xmath9 ions / s to avoid pile - up events .",
    "chimera consists of 1192 telescopes ( @xmath10e silicon detectors 200 - 300 @xmath6 m thick and csi(tl ) stopping detectors ) mounted on 35 rings covering 94% of the solid angle , with very high granularity at forward angles .",
    "details on a and z identifications and on the quality of energy calibrations can be found in refs .",
    "energy resolution was better than 1% for silicon detectors and varies between 1.0 and 2.5% for alpha particles stopped in csi(tl ) crystals .",
    "as a first step in our event selection procedure , we want to exclude from the data sample poorly - measured events . without making any hypothesis about the physics of the studied reaction one can measure the total detected charge @xmath11 ( neutrons are not measured ) . in relation with their cross - sections and with the geometrical efficiency of chimera ,",
    "the well detected reaction mechanisms correspond to projectile fragmentation ( pf )  @xcite with @xmath11=19 - 20 ( target fragmentation not detected ) and to incomplete / complete fusion with @xmath11=21 - 26 . at this stage",
    "we can have a first indication on the multiplicity of @xmath2-particles , @xmath12 , emitted per event for well detected events ( @xmath1319 - see fig.[fig : malpha ] ) .",
    "@xmath12 extends up to thirteen , which means a deexcitation of the total system into @xmath2-particles only .",
    "moreover a reasonable number of events exhibit @xmath12 values up to about 6 .",
    "the goal is now to tentatively isolate , in events , reaction products emitting @xmath2-particles only . to do this , knowing that at such incident energy @xmath14 as @xmath4 pf is dominated by alpha - conjugate products  @xcite , we restrict our selection to completely detected pf events ( @xmath11=20 ) composed of one projectile fragment and of four to six @xmath2-particles .",
    "charge conservation imposes @xmath15=20 - 2@xmath12 .",
    "projectiles : energy spectra ( in the @xmath16=5 system reference frame ) of evaporated @xmath2-particles associated to a @xmath4 evaporation residue .",
    "full points are experimental data and histograms are results of gemini simulations ( see text ) ]     projectiles : energy spectra ( in the @xmath16=5 system reference frame ) of evaporated @xmath2-particles associated to a @xmath4 evaporation residue .",
    "full points are experimental data and histograms are results of gemini simulations ( see text ) ]    after this double selection , the question is : from which emission source are the @xmath2-particles emitted ?",
    "several possibilities have to be considered and complementary selections must be done before restricting our study to alpha - sources emitting exclusively the @xmath12 observed ( called @xmath16 sources in what follows ) .",
    "possibilities associated to selected pf events are the following : i ) considering the incident energy of the reaction and the strong forward focusing of reaction products , it is important to identify the possible presence of preequilibrium ( pe ) @xmath2-particles in our selected pf events . with the hypothesis that all the @xmath2-particles are emitted from their centre - of - mass reference frame , we noted a thermal distribution with the presence of a high energy tail starting at 40 mev , which signs pe emission .",
    "events in which such pe emission was possibly present were suppressed to prevent errors on alpha emitter properties ; an upper energy limit was imposed to the @xmath2-particle energy , with a value of 40 mev irrespective of @xmath12 .",
    "\\ii ) @xmath2-particles can be emitted from deexcitation of pf events via unbound states of @xmath17 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and not directly from excited expanding @xmath16 sources .",
    "multi - particle correlation functions  @xcite were used to identify unbound states 100% @xmath2-particle emitters and suppress a small percentage of events ( 1.6 - 3.6% ) .",
    "\\iii ) it must be verified that the fragments associated with @xmath12 are not the evaporation residues of excited @xmath18 projectiles emitting only @xmath2-particles .",
    "as far as the two first items are concerned the effect was to suppress from 8.5 ( @xmath12=4 ) to 12.8% ( @xmath12=6 ) of previously selected events .",
    "the last item will be discussed in the following section .    to conclude on this part",
    ", one can also indicate that if excited @xmath16 sources have been formed their excitation energy thresholds for total deexcitation into @xmath2-particles vary from 20 to 50 mev when @xmath16 moves from 4 to 6 .",
    "their mean excitation energy per nucleon is rather constant around 3.3 - 3.5 mev which indicates that average lowest densities around 0.7 the normal density may have been reached due to thermal pressure  @xcite .",
    "before discussing different possible deexcitations of @xmath18 projectiles and @xmath16 sources , information on the selected reaction mechanism is needed .",
    "major features of pf events are reproduced by a model of stochastic transfers  @xcite . for primary events with @xmath11=20 excitation",
    "energy extends up to about 200 mev , which allows the large excitation energy domain ( 20 - 150 mev ) measured for @xmath16 sources when associated to a single fragment ; angular momenta extend up to 24 @xmath19 , which gives an upper spin limit for @xmath18 projectiles or @xmath16 sources .",
