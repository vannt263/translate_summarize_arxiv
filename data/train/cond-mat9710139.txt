    "of many fascinating experiments on high @xmath5 superconductors , the resonant neutron scattering peak observed in the @xmath3 family is an extremely striking one@xcite .",
    "it was first observed in the optimally doped @xmath3 materials .",
    "the mode exists only in a narrow region in reciprocal space near @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the lattice constants in the @xmath9 plane and @xmath10 is the distance between two neighboring @xmath9 planes in a unit cell .",
    "( in the following , we will set these lattice constants to unity to simplify notations ) .",
    "the energy of the resonance is @xmath11 and it disperses weakly in reciprocal space .",
    "perhaps the most striking property of this mode is its disappearance above @xmath5 .",
    "more recently , this type of collective mode has also been observed in the underdoped families of the @xmath3 superconductors . here",
    "the energy of this mode is @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for materials with @xmath5 values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . while the mode energy decreases monotonically with @xmath5 , the mode intensity increases as @xmath5 decreases .",
    "compared with the @xmath11 peak , these modes also have a broader spectral distribution below @xmath5 . in these underdoped materials the resonance",
    "is also observed above @xmath5 where it becomes significantly broader .",
    "all the modes have been observed in the neutron spin flip channel , and more recently , the @xmath11 mode was seen to broaden under a uniform magnetic field@xcite , both indicating that the modes are spin triplets .",
    "these striking resonances have generated wide theoretical interests and a number of theoretical ideas have been suggested in order to explain their properties@xcite .",
    "we believe that one key ingredient is the coupling of the neutron to the particle - particle ( p - p ) channel which occurs in the superconducting ( sc ) state via the condensate .",
    "in particular for a @xmath16 gap , the coherence factor @xmath17/2 $ ] for @xmath18 goes to unity at threshold rather than vanishing as it would for an @xmath19-wave superconductor@xcite .",
    "furthermore , two of us argued that the p - p interactions in this channel leads to a sharp resonance which was called the @xmath0-mode@xcite . in the normal state ,",
    "the resonance is decoupled from the neutron scattering , but can in principle be observed in pair tunneling experiments@xcite .",
    "this theory predicted the doping dependence of the mode energy and intensity which was subsequently verified experimentally@xcite .",
    "this picture was also later verified in detailed numerical calculations of the hubbard and the @xmath1-@xmath2 models@xcite .    in this paper , we study the @xmath0 resonance using a self - consistent linear response theory which formally takes into account the mixing of the particle - hole ( p - h ) with the p - p channels in the sc state .",
    "this formalism is explained in sec.[cf ] . in sec.[numerix ] , we present numerical results based on this formalism and show the overall structure of the spin correlation function .",
    "we then give an approximate but analytic expression for the resonance in sec.[analyt ] .",
    "in sec.[eom ] , we compare our formalism with the results obtained by using equations of motion for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and with the @xmath4 quantum non - linear sigma model . in sec.[summary ] , we summarize the results and conclude the paper with some general remarks . before going into these details ,",
    "we give here some general features of the @xmath0-resonance .",
    "the central object of the theory of the @xmath0 resonance is the so called @xmath0 operator@xcite , defined by @xmath20 with @xmath21 being pauli matrices and @xmath22 .",
    "this operator is a spin triplet and carries charge two .",
    "this operator inspired one of us ( scz ) to formulate the @xmath4 theory of high @xmath5 superconductivity@xcite . together with the total spin and total charge operators , the six @xmath0 operators form an @xmath4 lie algebra .",
    "a natural vector representation of this @xmath4 lie algebra is the superspin @xmath23 formed out of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order parameter    @xmath24    and the real and imaginary components of the @xmath25-wave superconducting ( dsc ) order parameter @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the @xmath25-wave form factor .",
    "the @xmath0 operator rotates @xmath28 and @xmath29 into each other @xmath30 =    i \\delta~\\delta_{\\alpha \\beta } \\label{commute}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore within the @xmath4 theory , af and dsc are unified into a common object , called superspin , which can be pictured as a unit vector on an @xmath4 sphere , see fig.[pi - sphere.eps ] .",
    "a direct first - order transition between these two phases can be induced by a chemical potential @xmath31 , and the superspin flops from the af direction into the dsc direction . however ,",
    "inside the dsc phase , there are 4 collective modes , which can be viewed as goldstone modes of the spontaneous @xmath4 symmetry breaking .",
    "the usual sc phase mode corresponds to the rotation inside the dsc plane , while there are three extra @xmath0 modes , corresponding to rotations towards the af directions , see fig.[pi - sphere.eps ] . because @xmath31 breaks the @xmath4 symmetry explicitly and constrains the superspin to lie at the equator , the @xmath0 fluctuations are massive . from this general consideration , we expect its mass , or the resonance energy , to decrease with decreasing doping .",
    "the @xmath4 theory therefore provides a simple picture of the @xmath0 modes as collective rotations in the @xmath4 sphere . without going into the microscopic details",
    ", this picture immediately provides us with some useful quantitative information . inside the dsc phase , the right hand side of the operator equation ( [ commute ] ) can be replaced by the expectation value of the dsc order parameter , giving @xmath30 = i \\langle \\delta \\rangle ~\\delta_{\\alpha \\beta } \\label{exp - commute}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation can be simply interpreted as the commutation relation between a set of canonically conjugate variables , just like @xmath32 and @xmath33 in elementary quantum mechanics .",
    "therefore , we see that a new set of collective quantum degrees of freedom emerges in the broken symmetry state characterized by a dsc order @xmath29 .",
    "this simple consideration explains why the @xmath0 resonance mode is only observed below @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the regime where a fluctuating @xmath29 order parameter exists , the @xmath0 resonance can also appear as a broad feature .    in the dsc state ,",
    "the @xmath0 mode couples directly to the spin operator @xmath34 .",
    "what is the dynamics associated with the @xmath0 operator ? this is a model dependent microscopic question .",
    "if one is dealing with an @xmath4 symmetric microscopic model@xcite , the dynamics of the @xmath0 operator is determined by the equation @xmath35 = \\omega_0 \\pi^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha } \\label{h - pi - com}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 symmetric models predict a sharp @xmath0 resonance whose energy scales with doping .",
    "the dynamics associated with the coupled @xmath0 and spin operator in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model is the central question studied in our current paper .",
    "however , even without detailed microscopic calculations , we can give general arguments to estimate the contribution from the @xmath0 operator to the spin correlation function .",
    "equation ( [ exp - commute ] ) leads to an important sum rule for the mixed correlation function between the spin and the @xmath0 operators . defining the mixed correlation function as @xmath37 and making use of eq.([exp - commute ] )",
    ", we have @xmath38 in addition , we also have another sum rule for the @xmath0 correlation function , which follows from the commutation relation @xmath39 = ( 1 - n ) ~\\delta_{\\alpha   \\beta } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is a filling factor ( half filling corresponds to @xmath41 ) . from these two sum rules , we can put a lower bound on the @xmath0 contribution to the spin excitation spectrum as @xmath42 as shown in the appendix .",
    "therefore , one would expect the @xmath0 contribution to the dynamic spin correlation function to scale as the square of the dsc order parameter and inversely with the doping @xmath43 .",
    "both of these conclusions are consistent with the experimental finding in the optimally doped @xmath3 that the neutron resonance mode disappears above @xmath5 as a sharp excitation , and with the doping dependence of its intensity .",
    "we can use typical values of @xmath44 ( see appendix for converting the order parameter to the quasiparticle energy gap ) , @xmath45 and doping @xmath46 to estimate the lower bound for @xmath47 as 0.32 .",
    "this is close to and consistent with the experimentally measured value , @xmath48@xcite . in a realistic model ,",
    "the @xmath0 operator is not an exact eigenoperator of the hamiltonian , and eq.([h - pi - com ] ) is only approximately fulfilled with other contributions to the energy @xmath49 .",
    "however , as long as the @xmath0 operator remains as an approximate eigenoperator , it will make a sharp contribution to the spin correlation function , and the energy of the mode will have a leading contribution of @xmath50 .",
    "in this paper , we shall study the @xmath0 mode of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model with nearest - neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "hopping . before presenting the details of the formalism",
    ", we would like to answer some general questions regarding the use of this model and the approximations .",
    "the first question concerns the effect of the n.n .",
    "coulomb interaction @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "even if we did not include a bare @xmath52 term , the reduction from the on - site hubbard model to the @xmath1-@xmath2 model would generate such a term with @xmath53 .",
    "actually , at this particular value of @xmath52 , the interaction between the quasi - particles making up a spin triplet is zero .",
    "one might be concerned that without the multiple scattering in the triplet channel , there would not be any @xmath0 resonance . however ,",
    "this is not the case . even in the absence of a triplet interaction",
    ", there is a sharp @xmath0 mode given by @xmath54 this occurs because the p - p continuum collapses to a point at total momentum @xmath55 .",
    "interaction in the triplet channel simply shifts the resonance energy from @xmath56 . in this paper",
    ", we shall only calculate the @xmath0 and spin correlation function with @xmath57 .",
    "the effect of @xmath52 is two - fold , it changes _ both _ the interaction in the @xmath0 triplet channel and the energy to destroy a @xmath25-wave pair in the ground state , thereby changing the chemical potential @xmath31 . since the @xmath52 interaction does not distinguish between the singlet cooper pair and the triplet @xmath0 pair , these two contributions will essentially cancel each other .",
    "this cancelation is indeed observed rather accurately in the numerical calculations in both the hubbard and the @xmath1-@xmath2 model@xcite . because the @xmath2 interaction is different in the singlet and triplet channels ,",
    "this cancelation does not occur .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we shall only study the effect of the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "the second question concerns the effect of the next nearest neighbor hopping term @xmath58@xcite . in the presence of this term ,",
    "the p - p continuum no longer collapses at total momentum @xmath59 , and it is not clear if the @xmath0 mode can remain sharp in the presence of @xmath58 .",
    "this question depends on the bandwidth around the @xmath60 and @xmath61 points in reciprocal space .",
    "while the bare bandwidth might be large , it is known from both photoemission and numerical experiments that many - body corrections reduce the bandwidth at these points significantly . assuming the reduced band structure , the @xmath0 mode remains sharp in the normal state .",
    "direct numerical calculations on the @xmath0 resonance also show that the @xmath0 mode remains sharp for a wide range of @xmath58 @xcite . because the many - body reduction of the bandwidth is hard to obtain from direct perturbation theory",
    ", we shall not address the @xmath58 issue in this paper .    in this work",
    ", we shall mainly discuss the two - dimensional case where the @xmath0 operator carries momentum @xmath62 .",
    "generalizations to bilayer system is straightforward . in this case",
    ", the @xmath0 operator rotates the 3d af state into the 3d dsc state , and carries momentum @xmath63 , i.e. it is odd under bilayer interchange . if the 3d @xmath0 operator is an approximate eigenoperator of the inter - layer hamiltonian , analysis presented in this paper will carry through in the bilayer case as well .",
    "finally we would like to address the issue of the large hubbard @xmath64 repulsion or the no double occupancy constraint in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall only treat the hubbard @xmath64 within the hartree approximation . in this case , its effect can be captured by a renormalization of the chemical potential@xcite and the hopping @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , we can treat the @xmath1-@xmath2 model within the slave boson mean field theory .",
    "here one replaces the electron operator @xmath65 by a product of @xmath66 . within the dsc state , the holons @xmath67 are condensed and can be replaced by its c - number expectation value . the resulting hamiltonian for the spinons",
    "@xmath68 is just a @xmath1-@xmath2 model with renormalized parameters , where the constraint is only treated on the average , again by adjusting the chemical potential and renormalizing the hopping parameter@xcite .",
    "these two formalism therefore lead to the same perturbation series in the interaction @xmath2 .",
    "we now review the self - consistent formalism for computing the spin correlation function in the sc state .",
    "this self - consistent approach has been pioneered by anderson@xcite and rickayzen@xcite in treating the problem of the response of a superconductor to an electromagnetic field and later used by bardasis and schrieffer to study collective excitations in a superconductor@xcite .",
    "the basic idea of this method is the same as that of any linear response calculation .",
    "we perturb a system by a small external field and then compute the corresponding induced response .",
    "it is however important to remember that when the system has sc order , any fluctuation in the p - h channel immediately mixes with fluctuations in the p - p , and hole - hole channels .",
    "this mixing is responsible for restoration of the transversality of the electromagnetic response of a superconductor@xcite and preserving the ward identities @xcite .",
    "microscopically it corresponds to taking into account the response of the superconductor due to the backflow of the condensate as well as the creation of the quasi - particle excitations .",
    "we have applied this formalism to the @xmath69-resonance in the negative-@xmath64 hubbard model@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and shown that it constitutes a conserving approximation , which gives excellent agreement with the exact theorems on the @xmath69-resonance of the @xmath70 hubbard model@xcite .",
    "similar formalism has been used recently by kohno , normand and fukuyama@xcite , salkola and schrieffer@xcite , and brinckmann and lee@xcite to study collective excitations .    in this paper",
    "we emphasize that the origin of the neutron resonance peak is coupling to the p - p channel below @xmath5 .",
    "the sclr formalism is a complete framework which takes this effect into account , and has been shown to agree with exact theorems where they are available@xcite .",
    "however , the naive rpa formula @xmath71 also contains partial information about mixing into the non - interacting p - p channel due to the anomalous @xmath72 term in @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the peak observed at @xmath56 in the rpa treatment may also have its origin due to p - p mixing .",
    "this argument is further strengthened by the findings in our present work that the rpa peak at @xmath56 moves to the energy of the interacting triplet pair within sclr formalism .",
    "we start by considering the @xmath1-@xmath2 model in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath74 ( only the zeeman effect of the applied field is of interest to us ) @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the spin operator .",
    "the system responds to the applied field @xmath77 in the spin channel as well as in the @xmath0 channels in such a way that the operators @xmath78 get non - vanishing time - dependent expectation values .",
    "their fourier transform will be denoted as @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the weight function , @xmath81 ( as defined earlier in eq.([gp ] ) ) , of the @xmath82 operators arises from the assumed @xmath25-wave symmetry of the order parameter ) by the possible symmetry factors @xmath83 where @xmath84 may be @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "such @xmath87 fields provide intermediate states that the spin fluctuations can be scattered into . in general this",
    "can modify the amplitude of the induced @xmath88 field .",
    "however it turns out that for the @xmath33 s of interest near @xmath89 , the effect of such @xmath87 fields is negligible . ] .    the hamiltonian ( [ t - j ] ) is then linearized by factoring out the dsc gap is the energy gap , which is related to the order parameter @xmath29 defined earlier by the relation , @xmath90 with @xmath91 . ] @xmath92 and the quantities @xmath93 and @xmath88 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we proceed by taking the first two terms in eq.([linear ] ) as the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath97 and use kubo formulas to treat the last three terms as the perturbation @xmath98 , @xmath99 \\rangle_{{\\cal h}_0 } .",
    "\\label{kubo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this procedure is described in detail in our earlier paper on the @xmath69 excitation of the negative-@xmath64 hubbard model@xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the amplitude and phase oscillations as @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "after some simple calculations , we arrive at the coupled equations for @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 : @xmath105 where @xmath106 in the equations above , @xmath107 ,   @xmath108 ,   @xmath109 ,   @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "the green s functions have been defined as @xmath112 in eq.([factors ] ) , @xmath113 should be taken to have an infinitesimal imaginary part , @xmath114 , coming from causality .",
    "solution of eqs.([set ] ) gives the dynamical spin susceptibility in this self - consistent linear response theory ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "@xmath116 \\rangle     = \\frac{s_{q\\omega } } { h_{q \\omega } } .",
    "\\label{chi - def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be written in the form @xmath117 and may be understood as a modified random phase approximation ( rpa ) where the bare bubble @xmath118 has been modified by including the ladder diagrams . fig.[diag.eps ] gives the diagrammatic interpretation of formulas ( [ chi_irr ] ) , ( [ mrpa ] ) .",
    "the procedure for finding the p - p correlation function @xmath119 \\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is very similar to the one shown above for the spin channel .",
    "we only need to add an external field in the @xmath120 channel and compute the response in the same channel . skipping the laborious but straightforward calculations we present the final expression for its fourier transform @xmath121    in the normal state this reduces to a simple t - matrix expression that was studied in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that , in the normal state , the p - p spectrum at @xmath59 is dominated by the collective @xmath0-mode resonance that appears due to the collapse of the p - p continuum ( @xmath122 ) and the repulsive interaction of two particles in a triplet state sitting on n.n .  sites .",
    "we suggested that this collective mode may contribute to the spin - fluctuation spectrum when the system becomes superconducting .",
    "however such argument raises an immediate concern that superconductivity could in principle lead to another effect @xmath123 a significant broadening of the @xmath0 resonance , due to possible scattering into the p - h excitations .",
    "the goal of the next part is to show that this does not happen .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance survives as a collective mode and affects strongly the dynamic spin - spin correlation function in the sc state .",
    "the important point here is that unlike @xmath118 , @xmath124 in @xmath125 contains information about the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , @xmath126 nearly vanishes at the @xmath0 resonance energy , where @xmath127 is sharply peaked . the combination of these two effects give rise to a sharp @xmath0 resonance",
    "it is well known that the rpa form of the spin correlation function overestimates the antiferromagnetic instability .",
    "therefore , if we see a peak in the dynamic spin correlation function , it is important to check if it is an artifact due to the rpa type of overestimate or due to a genuine collective mode .",
    "moreover , the size of the dsc gap relative to @xmath5 is significantly larger than the bcs estimate .",
    "the bcs gap equation for @xmath97 is @xmath128 with the bare pairing interaction @xmath129 .",
    "however , this gives a @xmath130 ratio of the order of 4 which is small compared to the typically observed value of 6 to 8 .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we take two approaches to these problems .",
    "we introduce an effective reduction of the antiferromagnetic vertex @xmath131 with @xmath132 , as a way to model vertex corrections , or we take the dsc gap @xmath133 to be bigger than its mean field value .",
    "both of these approaches have the effect of removing the rpa type of af instability .",
    "we shall see that the @xmath0 resonance is robust against these variations .      in this section",
    "we take @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we choose the mean - field value of @xmath136 and the reduction of @xmath137 is set by @xmath138 .",
    "we assume a finite value @xmath139 for the imaginary infinitesimal in the energy denominator and perform integration by dividing the brillouin zone into a @xmath140 lattice .",
    "this plot shows the `` mechanics '' of the resonance in @xmath141 . in the normal state",
    "the p - p channel has a sharp peak at @xmath142 .",
    "notice that there is no visible shift of the energy of this resonance in the sc state , but only a small broadening .",
    "this resonance in the p - p channel @xmath143 then leads to a peak in @xmath144 .",
    "consequently at a frequency where @xmath145 the real part of the denominator in the sclr expression ( [ mo - rpa ] ) vanishes leading to a peak in @xmath146 . at these frequencies ,",
    "the imaginary part of the denominator ( @xmath147 ) is also small , and the resonance appears to be quite sharp .    in fig.[mre.eps ] , we compare the real part of @xmath125 with that of @xmath118 . as discussed above , we have resonance peaks in @xmath148 when @xmath149 .",
    "we can see that taking @xmath125 instead of @xmath118 considerably suppresses the divergence around @xmath56 ( this divergence comes from the dynamic nesting of the fermi surface .",
    "it gives rise to the rpa peak , the only resonance one gets from a naive rpa calculation . ) and leads to the development of a peak at the energy of the @xmath0-excitation .",
    "it is easily noticeable that if we do not take into account reduction of @xmath137 , but exploit the bare value of @xmath150 , then re@xmath125 will cross it at two points ( @xmath151 and @xmath49 ) , giving rise to both @xmath123 rpa and @xmath0 peaks ( see fig.[malpha.eps ] ) .",
    "however , the divergence of re@xmath125 around @xmath49 is much stronger , making the @xmath0 peak more robust against variations in @xmath137 .    in fig.[mim.eps ] , we show the imaginary part of @xmath125 and @xmath118 .",
    "note that a dip develops in im@xmath125 at the energy of the @xmath0-excitation .",
    "this means that the @xmath0-resonance is much less damped than one might have expected . in the normal state ,",
    "the stability of the @xmath0 resonance is guaranteed by the absence of the phase space available for decay ( p - p continuum collapses to a point ) . in the dsc state , this argument no longer works .",
    "mixing of the p - h and p - p channels could provide a mechanism for the decay of the @xmath0 excitation .",
    "however , we see that the system accommodates the @xmath0 excitation by suppressing im@xmath125 at its energy . in section [ analyt ]",
    ", we shall give an approximate analytical derivation of this important feature .    in fig.[mtot.eps",
    "] , we compare the self - consistent spin - spin correlation function @xmath141 with the one obtained from the rpa calculation , @xmath152 .",
    "the latter one has an rpa peak that comes from the dynamic nesting of the tight - binding hamiltonian at momentum @xmath59 . in im@xmath141",
    ", this peak disappears almost completely , and the the spectral weight is transfered into the @xmath0-excitation .    in fig.[malpha.eps ] , we show the comparison of different choices of @xmath153 in @xmath137 .",

    "reducing @xmath153 has no effect on the @xmath0 resonance but completely destroys the rpa peak .    from the analysis carried out in this subsection ,",
    "we conclude that the rpa peak might be the the result of overestimating the af instability , while the @xmath0 peak is robust against vertex corrections .",
    "another way of suppressing af instability within rpa or sclr formalism is to choose a larger dsc energy gap .    in fig.[del.eps ]",
    ", we compare the results of sclr calculations for the spin correlation function for two choices of @xmath133 .",
    "the smaller one , @xmath155 , corresponds to the self - consistent ( mean - field ) value , and the bigger one was taken as @xmath156 . in these calculations ,",

    "fig.[del.eps ] shows that taking a larger dsc gap removes the rpa peak and increases the spectral weight of the @xmath0 peak .",
    "this has an even stronger effect than we saw in the previous section by reducing the af exchange constant .",
    "the latter one , as we found , only removes the rpa peak without affecting the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "it is also interesting to find that for the larger gap there is an increase in the energy of the resonance .",
    "a tenacious effect of the large dsc gap is explained in fig.[ri.eps ] . here",
    "the choice of parameters is the same as in the previous figure with @xmath159 . by looking at @xmath125 in this case of large @xmath133",

    "\\2 ) within model - dependent calculations , there is a well - defined @xmath0 mode in the p - p channel in the normal state , and this mode couples to the p - h spin channel in the dsc state , where it remains as a sharp excitation .",
    "the energy of this mode is not directly related to the dsc gap , but is directly related to the doping @xmath222 . in the underdoped materials ,",
    "the dsc gap increases slightly as doping is reduced , while the neutron resonance peak energy decreases with @xmath222 .",
    "this important experimental finding shows that the neutron resonance peak is not simply a ",
    "@xmath223 \" phenomenon , and our interpretation in terms of the @xmath0 resonance naturally resolves this apparent paradox . the doping dependence of both energy and intensity of the neutron resonance peak were predicted@xcite before the experiments in the underdoped superconductors were carried out@xcite .",
    "\\3 ) many approximations within our current calculations are not completely controlled .",
    "however , the main behavior can be verified in the case where exact knowledge is available .",
    "first of all , detailed exact diagonalization studies have been carried out both for the @xmath1-@xmath2 and the hubbard models@xcite .",
    "it is clearly seen that the @xmath0 mode in the p - p channel exists in all doping range , and it has a low - energy peak where both the energy and intensity scale with @xmath222 , in agreement with our@xmath224-matrix calculation .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath0 correlation function , the spin correlation function does not have sharp peaks in the high doping range . in the doping range where there are dsc fluctuations",
    ", the @xmath0 peak coincides with the spin peak . from these results",
    ", one can conclude that the @xmath0 mode is a genuine collective mode .",
    "we can also compare our approximations with the exact @xmath4 models@xcite , where the @xmath0 operators are exact eigenoperators of the hamiltonian .",
    "the manipulations presented in this work lead to results consistent with the exact @xmath4 ward identities .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance is an exact excitation of the @xmath4 models , and it has exactly the same doping dependence of the mode energy and intensity as obtained here .",

    ", they share the same quantum numbers , and both are based on approximate calculations .",
    "the origin of the rpa peak may be related to the overestimate of the magnetic instability and we see that it may not be robust against variations of the vertex corrections or variations of the gap , both of which diminish af instability . on the other hand ,",
    "the sclr treatment of the @xmath0 peak is more robust against these variations .",
    "one can test these two approximate schemes within the exact @xmath4 models . only sclr treatment including the  @xmath0",
    "\" process agree with the exact answer in this case .",
    "therefore , calculations including the  @xmath0 \" process is a better approximation than the simple rpa calculation .",
    "\\5 ) within our approximations , the spin spectrum consists of an incommensurate structure at low frequencies , a sharp commensurate peak arising from the triplet excitation in the p - p channel ( the @xmath0 peak ) , and a missing spectral weight at commensurate wavevector at higher frequencies .",
    "these features are in overall agreement with experiments . the predicted weight of the @xmath0 resonance agrees quantitatively with experiments .    therefore , while each of the above arguments are not complete on their own , the combination of them makes a strong overall case . from the interpretation of the neutron resonance peak in terms of the @xmath0 mode",
    ", we hope to learn a general principle , rather than a specific model for fitting a specific experiment . in strongly correlated systems ,",
    "most degrees of freedoms are strongly coupled , and most spectra are incoherent . usually , only a symmetry principle can forbid the decay of a collective excitation . in the case of the resonant neutron scattering peak , we believe that it is the @xmath4 symmetry principle at work , and the @xmath0 mode is the pseudo goldstone boson associated with this spontaneous symmetry breaking . in this paper , we have shown that such an interpretation is consistent with the key experimental facts , but it may not be the only possible interpretation .",
