    "the recent series of angle - resolved - photoemission experiments in high-@xmath2 superconductors have brought a large number of new insights concerning the low energy single - particle states of these materials .",
    "the experimental observations include a rather wide flat - band region around @xmath4 in the effective band dispersion@xcite and also the anisotropy of the normal state pseudogap @xcite which is consistent with the @xmath5-wave symmetry superconducting gap .",
    "many theoretical approaches and computer simulations have been performed to investigate the pseudogap .",
    "naturally , our ultimate objective is to explain the existing experimental data .",
    "however , the main purpose of this work is not to give a direct explanation of the experiments , but rather , to study the pseudogap formation in the hubbard model which is often used to describe the high-@xmath2 materials .    to avoid confusion ,",
    "we should make clear what kinds of pseudogap we are dealing with in this paper . in reality , in the literature this term has been used to represent several different features . what it is common in all cases is the fact that the pseudogap indicates a suppression or disappearance of the spectral intensity at the fermi level .",
    "we can list the following three different cases .",
    "the first one is a disappearance of the spectral intensity due to the downward shift of the band dispersion around @xmath4 region@xcite .",
    "for example , some of the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations show such behavior in the strong coupling regime and at very low dopings@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is quite interesting since it looks as if it violates the luttinger theorem on the fermi surface .",
    "the second case is an effective pseudogap in the spectral function between a strong quasiparticle peak and a weak satellite peak .",
    "it is possible to find this situation even in a normal fermi liquid .",
    "the third one is a suppression of the single - particle peak at the fermi level with a two peak structure in its place .",
    "the pseudogap of our interest is this latter case .",
    "it should be clearly distinguishable from the second case .",
    "one physical origin of this kind of pseudogap is of course the fact that it is a precursor of the spin density wave ( sdw ) transition which takes place in the @xmath6-@xmath5 hubbard model for zero doping at @xmath7 .",
    "we are aware of some models which take into account precursor effects of the superconducting transition to explain the pseudogap behavior observed in the normal phase of high-@xmath2 materials@xcite .",
    "we do nt consider the superconducting transition effects in this paper .    in our work",
    ", we provide an explanation of the origin of the pseudogap formation in the @xmath6-@xmath5 hubbard model , at half - filling , in the weak coupling regime . to calculate the spectrum we use a single - particle green s function which has a paramagnon - like one - loop self - energy correction for both charge and spin channels . at first",
    "we show the results of our numerical calculations of the density of states ( dos ) , the spectral function , and the self - energy .",
    "the analysis of the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy plays a crucial role in the understanding of the microscopic origin of the possible structures of the spectra . following this , we discuss the detailed origin of the pseudogap formation within our formulation .",
    "we found pseudogap formations at the fermi level in both the spectral function and the dos .",
    "the pseudogap in the spectral function is explained by the non - fermi - liquid behavior of the self - energy , i.e. , its imaginary part has a negative peak and its real part has a positive slope .",
    "we show that both the strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and the nesting condition on the non - interacting fermi surface are the origins of the anomalous behaviors in the self - energy .",
    "we also generally argue the relation between the spectral function and the self - energy at the fermi level .",
    "we show , for example , that if the spectral function has a pseudogap , the real part of the self - energy has a positive slope at the fermi level .",
    "an auxiliary relation is used to present the argument .",
    "this relation derived from the kramers - kronig transformation is proved in the appendix .",
    "the numerically obtained pseudogap shows a strong momentum dependence . for a certain choice of the parameters",
    ", the pseudogap appears around @xmath4 but not at @xmath8 .",
    "we show that the anisotropic pseudogap comes from the low - energy enhancement of the spin excitation around @xmath3 and the flatness of the band dispersion .",
    "in the momentum representation the hubbard model , with a nearest - neighbor hopping , on a two - dimensional square lattice can be written as @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 representing the spin index and with @xmath12 being the coupling constant of the on - site coulomb repulsion between two electrons with opposite spins .",
    "we redefine the chemical potential @xmath13 by adding the hartree - fock term and this is chosen as the origin of the energy for the half - filling case .",
    "we next introduce the single - particle green s function at finite temperature in the paramagnetic regime . in general",
    ", we can write the full single - particle green s function as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the proper self - energy . here , in the weak - coupling regime , we consider the one - loop self - energy correction to the green s function .",
    "the formulation we use is based on the standard perturbation expansion over @xmath17 .",
    "these one - loop corrections are constructed with the free ( mean - field ) fermion line and the corresponding charge or spin fluctuation lines .",
    "the charge and spin fluctuations are described in terms of the susceptibilities calculated within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "we neglect higher - order contributions which appear in the diagrammatic series expansion .",
    "this kind of approximation has already been used in paramagnon theory@xcite .",
    "thus , the one - loop self - energy is simply @xmath18 g_0({\\bf k}+{\\bf q},\\omega_n+\\nu_m )      \\label{sigpara}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the charge susceptibility as @xmath19 $ ] and the spin susceptibility as @xmath20 $ ] . to avoid the double counting of the second - order self - energy diagram ,",

    "to calculate the spectra obtained from the above green s function , we made the analytic continuation of the energy variables of the self - energy and the green s function . in this way we obtained the retarded self - energy and the retarded green s function .",

    "the corresponding real part can be obtained from the imaginary part by means of the kramers - kronig transformation . using those schemes ,",

    "the high - energy band tails are developed as @xmath17 becomes large .",

    "the pseudogap develops as we lower the temperature . using the stoner condition",
    ", we numerically found that @xmath42 is the sdw transition temperature for @xmath41 .",
    "the temperature effect appears only around the fermi level and the overall high - energy structure is left almost unchanged .",
    "a similar calculation of the dos was done in the work by kampf and schrieffer@xcite .",
    "they have also obtained the pseudogap formation near the fermi level @xmath43 for a weakly doped hubbard model at zero temperature . in their calculation",
    "they took into account only the spin fluctuation effects in an one - loop self - energy similar to ours .",
    "since the spin fluctuation effect becomes much stronger than the charge contribution near the sdw transition , the similarity of our calculation and theirs is natural .",
    "pseudogap openings in the dos in the weak - coupling regime has been observed in a qmc simulation@xcite .",
    "they obtained pseudogaps for @xmath44 and @xmath45 for several lattice sizes from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",

    "we can now explain the origin of the non - fermi - liquid negative peak behavior in @xmath55 in the present formulation .",

    "thus , the low energy enhancement in the spin fluctuation around @xmath126 makes a stronger contribution to @xmath78 at @xmath51 than that at @xmath120 . as a result",
    ", the self - energy has a remarkable momentum dependence , and the anisotropy of the pseudogap is explained .",
    "there are some qmc simulations of the spectral functions in the weak - coupling regime at half - filling@xcite . with the exception of the results from creffield et al .",
    "( ref .  ) , a clear evidence of the anisotropic pseudogap in the spectral function is lacking in the qmc simulations .",
    "we think that this is also due to the cluster size effect and the difference in method in extracting the information of the spectral function from the green s function as emphasized in ref .  .",
    "we know of no other example of the anisotropic pseudogap in the @xmath134-@xmath12 hubbard model",
    ". however , in flex calculations , for the doped hubbard model@xcite , a clear momentum dependence in the imaginary part of the self - energy at @xmath43 near the fermi momentum was obtained .",
    "they found that @xmath135 has a large value along the fermi surface which becomes larger and larger as @xmath136 approaches the @xmath4 region .",
    "this tendency is consistent with our results at half - filling shown in fig .",
    "[ spcfig2 ] ( c ) .",
    "in this work we have studied the pseudogap formation in the two - dimensional hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "we obtain a pseudogap formation in the density of states and in the spectral function .",
    "the pseudogap of the spectral function is produced when two conditions are satisfied : ( i ) a strong anti - ferromagnetic spin fluctuation , ( ii ) a nesting condition on the fermi surface .",
    "the pseudogap on the fermi energy is highly anisotropic and its associated symmetry is similar to the @xmath5-wave symmetry .",
    "the anisotropy is determined by the flatness of the band dispersion .",
    "we emphasize that the pseudogap formation discussed is highly dependent on the specific character ( perfect nesting ) of the free band dispersion or the hopping term in the square lattice .",
    "thus , the pseudogap is physically different from a gap formation such as the mott insulator transition which takes place in a strong coupling regime .",
    "our pseudogap can take place even in the weak coupling regime .",
    "we have focused on the undoped single - band hubbard model with nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "unfortunately , the model we have used may be quite simple to make a quantitative comparison with the experimental data . nevertheless , it is possible to apply our argument in the pseudogap originated , for example , in the hubbard model with the next nearest neighbor hopping ( @xmath134-@xmath137-@xmath12 model ) . in this model ,",
    "the nesting condition associated with the momentum @xmath126 holds only around the @xmath4 region ( and , of course , also at the other symmetric three parts in the brillouin zone ) .",
    "hence , the pseudogap will open in this region .",
    "however , the region in the @xmath138 direction on the fermi surface does not satisfy the nesting condition .",
    "thus , we can predict that the electronic states around this diagonal region will remain in the fermi liquid regime .",
    "our argument is consistent with the physical picture of the so - called _ hot _ and _ cold _ quasiparticles by b. stojkovi and pines@xcite .",
    "investigation with more realistic models will be done in future works .",
    "very recently , the information of the self - energy has been extracted from the angle - resolved photoemission data@xcite . in the work",
    ", it has been obtained that the observed normal state pseudogap accompanies a sharp negative peak in @xmath139 and a positive slope in @xmath140 .",
    "the tendency of their data is qualitatively in good agreement with our results .    in the present work we have used a paramagnon - theory self - energy to calculate the electronic states .",
    "this treatment has a restriction due to the stoner criterion in the rpa susceptibility .",
    "however , we believe that already in the level of this scheme , it contains important ingredients for the pseudogap formation and the partial destruction of the fermi - liquid quasiparticles at the fermi level .",
    "in particular , the anisotropic pseudogap formation in the spectral function in the calculated band dispersion indicates the coexistence of the fermi - liquid - like quasiparticles and the sdw - like quasiparticles at the fermi level .",
    "we would like to acknowledge useful discussions with s. l. garavelli and p. e. de brito .",
    "this work was supported by the conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico - cnpq and by the financiadora de estudos e projetos - finep .",
    "most part of the numerical calculations of this work have been done with the supercomputing system at the institute for materials research , tohoku university , japan .",
    "thanks the material science group at imr tohoku university for the use of the supercomputing facilities .",
    "in this appendix we give a simple proof of a relation obtained from the kramers - kronig transformation .",
    "we apply this relation to the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy in the main text of the present paper .",
    "the relation holds for any smooth functions .",
    "suppose the following kramers - kronig relation for such two functions @xmath141 and @xmath142 , @xmath143 then , the relation can be mentioned as follows .",
    "if @xmath142 has a maximum ( minimum ) at a certain point @xmath144 , @xmath141 has a positive ( negative ) slope at @xmath145 .",
    "we assume that @xmath142 has a peak at @xmath144 and it can be expanded around @xmath145 as @xmath146 .",
    "this is reasonable as far as @xmath142 is a smooth function . here",
    ", @xmath147 is the second derivative of @xmath142 at @xmath144 . if @xmath148 @xmath149 , then the peak is a minimum ( maximum ) .",
    "let s observe the difference between @xmath150 and @xmath151 with @xmath152 being a small shift from @xmath145 .",
    "we obtain that @xmath153 we easily see that the function @xmath154 $ ] decreases rapidly as @xmath155 deviates from @xmath145 and @xmath156 .",
    "we can approximate the integration using the expansion of @xmath142 around @xmath145 as @xmath157 } { ( x'-x_0)^2-\\eps ( x'-x_0)}.\\ ] ] where @xmath158 , and besides , @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath161 and @xmath162 in a way which the expansion of @xmath142 is valid . by evaluating the integral up to the leading order of @xmath152 , we obtain @xmath163 thus , for @xmath148 ( @xmath164 ) at @xmath144 , the slope of @xmath151 is positive ( negative ) .    by applying the same argument to the opposite transformation defined as @xmath165 we find that if @xmath141 has a maximum ( minimum ) at @xmath144 , the slope of @xmath142 at @xmath144 is negative ( positive ) .    in the above derivation , we assumed that the functions of our interests can be approximated with a quadratic form around a peak point we have interests .",
    "one can show the same relation in the case that the function behaves as @xmath166 around @xmath144 .",
    "this is what happens if @xmath142 is the imaginary part of the self - energy of a marginal fermi liquid@xcite .",
    "even if the peak is a @xmath167-function , the relation we argued is still applicable although the slope becomes infinite .",
    "one example of this can be seen in the mean - field green s function for the spin - density - wave states ."
