    "competition interface__. since the numerical simulations perfomed by derrida and dickman @xcite it is well known that the large space and time behavior of this interface strongly depends on the geometry of the initial profile ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "later , ferrari , martin and pimentel @xcite considered the competition interface between two clusters in the lattice last - passage percolation set - up and they established a connection between this interface and the so called second - class particle in the totally asymetric exclusion process .",

    "we do something similar but now in the context of a one dimensional layer by layer growth model @xcite , named the _ polynuclear growth _ ( png ) model .",
    "this model describes a crystal growing layer by layer on a one dimensional substrate through random deposition of particles that nucleate on the existing plateaus of the crystal forming new islands .",
    "these islands spread laterally with speed @xmath1 and adjancent islands of the same level coalesce upon meeting ( figure [ 1png ] ) .        to consider a multi - type cristal growth model we assume that the initial substrate is divided into two different types of crystals , say type @xmath1",
    "if @xmath2 and type @xmath3 if @xmath4 . the dynamics stipulates that if a nucleation occurs on a existing plateau of type @xmath5 then the new island will be of the same type .",

    "of course the behavior of this model depends on the geometry of the nucleation events , which can be seen as a point process @xmath6 in @xmath7-space - time .",
    "we restrict our attention to a particular class of point processes @xmath6 ( png growth with external sources ) and we show a law of large numbers for the competition interface .    the png model can be studied in a directed polymer context @xcite and we show that the space - time path of the competition interface is a particular example of a _",

    "we also show that the exponent whose value measures the order of the fluctuations of a @xmath0-path about its asymptotic value is at most @xmath8 .",
    "the proofs are based on the notion of maximal paths and its relation with @xmath0-paths , together with some bounds for the tail of the lenght of the longest directed polymer connecting two distinct points on the space - time plane obtained by baik and rains @xcite .",
    "the png and the directed polymer models are intrisictly related to the hammersley interacting particle system and another examples of @xmath0-paths arise naturally in this context , named the second - class particle . as a consequence , we obtain a law of large numbers for this special particle which , together with some hydrodynamic ideas introduced by cator and groenemboom @xcite , will also play and important role in studying the asymptotics of @xmath0-paths .    in the next sections we formally introduce all the models considered here and we state the main results .      the surface at time @xmath9",
    "is described by an integer - valued function @xmath10 , named the height profile at time @xmath11 , for which the discontinuity points have upper limits .",

    "a _ nucleation _",
    "event at position @xmath7 is a creation of a spike , a pair of up- and down - steps , over the previous layer .",
    "the up - steps move to the left with unit speed and the down - steps move to the right with unit speed . when an up- and down - steps collide they disappear .",
    "the nucleation events form a locally finite point process in space - time .",

    "on @xmath23 we put a poisson point process @xmath24 of intensity @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that outside @xmath25 there is no nucleation event and that all the poisson point processes involved in this construction are mutually independent . to know the value of @xmath26 one draws the trajectories of the up- and down - steps in the space - time @xmath7-plane .",
    "when two of these paths meet ( as @xmath11 increases ) they stop , which reflects the disappearing of the corresponding up- and down - step . in this way the space - time is divided into regions bounded by piecewise straight lines with slopes equal to @xmath1 or @xmath27 ( figure [ sp - ti ] ) . for fixed @xmath28",
    "the height @xmath26 is constant in each region .        to introduce the multi - type growth model",
    "we assume that the initial layer is divided into two different types of crystals , say @xmath1 if @xmath2 and @xmath3 if @xmath4 .",

    "there is a link between the png growth model and a model for directed polymers on poisson points @xcite .",
    "this directed polymer model can be regarded as a last - passage percolation model on @xmath45 and is defined as follows . put a poisson point process @xmath46 of intensity @xmath1 in the strictly positive quadrant @xmath47 .",

    "we do believe that theorem [ path ] is almost optimal , i.e. that the correct exponent should be @xmath8 .",
    "aldous and diaconis @xcite introduced a continuous time version of the interacting particle process in hammersley @xcite using the following rule . start with the poisson point process @xmath46 on @xmath105 , of intensity @xmath1 , and move the interval @xmath106 $ ] vertically through a realization of this point process ; if this interval catches a point that is to the right of the points caught before , a new point ( or particle ) is created in @xmath106 $ ] at this point ; otherwise we shift to this point the previously caught point that is immediately to the right and belongs to @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "the number of particles , resulting from this rule , at time @xmath51 on the the interval @xmath106 $ ] is denoted by @xmath107 and the evolving particle process @xmath108 is called the _ hammersley process_. in this work we consider an extension of the hammersley process , as introduced by groenemboom @xcite , where we also have two others poisson point processes @xmath48 and @xmath49 , of intensities @xmath109 and @xmath110 and on the @xmath50- and @xmath51-axis , respectively .",
    "points in @xmath48 are called sources while points in @xmath49 are called sinks .",
    "now we have the following rule : start the interacting particle process with a configuration of sources on the @xmath50-axis , which are subjected to the hammersley interacting rule in the strictly positive quadrant and which escape through the sinks on the @xmath51-axis , if such a sink appears to the immediate left of a particle .",

    "denote by @xmath114 the space - time paths of the hammersley particles with the convention that @xmath115 and that @xmath116 lies below @xmath117 .",
    "thus , @xmath70 equals to @xmath116 ( recall we have constructed both process with the same poissonian points ) .",
    "again , if the poissonian process are related by @xmath75 , the rotated space - time paths of the up- and down steps correspond to the space - time paths of hammersley particles . with this picture in mind , one can also see that the @xmath0-points are the left turns of the space - time paths of the particles in the hammersley process ( figure [ 2class ] ) .",
    "we remark also that , in the stationary regime @xmath118 , cator and groenemboom @xcite proved that the @xmath0-points inherit the poisson property of @xmath46 , which allows us to see a duality between @xmath0-paths and maximal paths : a finite @xmath0-path is a maximal path for the time reversal process .",
    "it turns out that another example of a @xmath0-path appears naturally in the hammersley process : the so called _ second - class particles_. a normal second - class particle is a special particle that starts at the origin and jumps to the previous position of the ordinary hammersley particle that exits through the first sink at the time of the exit , and successively jumps to the previous position of particles directly to the right of it , at times where these particles jump to a position to the left of the second - class particle ( figure [ 2class ] ) .",
    "the position of the second - class particle at time @xmath51 is denoted by @xmath119 .",
    "thus , if @xmath120 denotes the time of the @xmath32-th jump of the second - class particle ( with the convention that @xmath121 ) then @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , is a @xmath0-path .",

    "the fluctuations of @xmath0-paths should be gaussian .",
    "we note that , in the png context , this corresponds to the convergence of the competition interface to @xmath136 .",
    "we also remark that , analogously to the second class particle in the totally asymmetric exclusion process @xcite , the convergence to a deterministic limit value with gaussian fluctuations is due to the development of a shock in the evolution of the macroscopic profile ( hydrodynamic limit ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by studying the stationary regime @xmath118 ( section [ sstat ] ) and we prove theorem [ path ] ( in this regime ) by using remark [ stat ] together with the concept of dual second - class particles .",

    "we start by deriving the convergence in distribution of the second - class particle with coupling ideas of ferrari and kpnis @xcite and general hydrodynamics results of sepplinen @xcite .",

    "the concept of a dual second - class particle was introduced by cator and groeneboom @xcite to prove the convergence of the normal second - class particle in the stationary regime .",
