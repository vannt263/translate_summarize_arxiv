    "we begin by presenting results for the prisoner s dilemma game on the square lattice .",
    "figure  [ pdsq ] shows how the stationary fraction of cooperators @xmath1 varies in dependence on the temptation to defect @xmath2 for different values of @xmath0 . the curve for @xmath3 is a well - known result of evolutionary spatial games , according to which in the absence of the `` wisdom of the group '' effect cooperators on the square lattice die out at the critical @xmath4 , and the extinction belongs to the directed percolation universality class @xcite . as the knowledge of the group",
    "is taken into account , however , the critical temptation to defect shifts towards larger values .",
    "in fact , the higher the value of @xmath0 , the higher the critical value of @xmath2 at which cooperators die out . also worth highlighting",
    "is that for @xmath3 cooperators are never able to completely dominate the population .",
    "conversely , for @xmath5 there always exist a critical temptation to defect below which defectors die out .",
    "again , the higher the value of @xmath0 , the higher the value of @xmath2 at which defectors are still unable to survive .",
    "the conclusion that imposes itself is thus that the `` wisdom of groups '' promotes the evolution of cooperation and thus aids the resolution of social dilemmas .",
    "not only are the cooperators able to survive at higher values of @xmath2 , but also their range of complete dominance increases with increasing values of @xmath0 .    further supporting the generality of our observations are results obtained on the honeycomb lattice , which are presented in fig .",
    "[ pdhon ] .",
    "the honeycomb lattice has the lowest degree possible for spatial graphs ( @xmath6 ) , which should minimize the effects of spatial reciprocity . despite of this , taking into account the `` wisdom of groups ''",
    "has virtually an identical impact on the evolution of cooperation as it does on the square lattice .",
    "it is also well known that cooperation is markedly affected by the type of the interaction network @xcite , where in particular the scale - free degree distribution has been identified as a potent promoter of cooperative behavior @xcite .",
    "furthermore , more subtle properties of interaction networks , such as the clustering coefficient and the average degree of players have also been emphasized as being crucial @xcite .",
    "we therefore simulated the evolutionary process also on the triangular lattice , which has a high clustering coefficient , and we observed a qualitatively similar impact of the `` wisdom of groups '' effect .",
    "thereby we thus establish that the reported promotion of cooperation is to a large degree independent of the particularities of the interaction network .    besides different interaction networks , the distinction between games governed by pairwise interactions and games governed by group interactions may also play a crucial role , as emphasized in the introduction . while the prisoner s dilemma is the paradigmatic example of a pairwise driven game ,",
    "the same is true for the public goods game as the game that is governed by group interactions . with this in mind , we present in fig .",
    "[ pggsq ] the stationary fraction of cooperators in dependence on the multiplication factor @xmath7 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "note that unlike for the value of @xmath2 in the prisoner s dilemma game , here the lower the value of @xmath7 the more challenging the evolution of cooperation .",
    "for @xmath3 the outcome is again a well - known result , according to which cooperators die out at the critical @xmath8 and start dominating the population completely at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath0 the `` wisdom of groups '' is introduced to the players , and accordingly the critical values of @xmath7 shift .",
    "it can be observed that the higher the value of @xmath0 , the lower the critical multiplication factors at which cooperators are able to survive and dominate the evolutionary competition with defectors .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the interval of @xmath7 values supporting the coexistence of both strategies shrinks continuously as @xmath0 increases .",
    "altogether , these results convincingly support the fact that the `` wisdom of groups '' effect supports the evolution of cooperation not only in games governed by pairwise interactions , but also in games that are governed by group interactions .    given the general applicability of the reported cooperation - promoting mechanism , it is of significant interest to elucidate why then taking into account the wider knowledge of groups upon deciding whether or not to change a strategy is so beneficial for the effective resolution of social dilemmas .",
    "henceforth we focus on the prisoner s dilemma game on the square lattice , although we note that qualitatively identical results can also be obtained on other lattices or with the public goods game .",
    "first , we present in fig .  [",
    "prepared ] characteristic spatial patterns that emerge if the evolutionary process is initiated from a prepared initial state .",
    "the goal is to start with rough interfaces , as the evolution along them has often been identified as crucial for deciding the winner between cooperators and defectors in spatial games .",
    "for @xmath3 ( top row ) , in the absence of the `` wisdom of groups '' where the learning activity of all players is the same ( see fig .  [ alpha ] ) , defectors can easily invade cooperators , and their invasions make the interface increasingly irregular [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "this in turn further weakens spatial reciprocity and finally results in a pure @xmath10 phase ( not shown ) . for @xmath11 ( bottom row ) , when the `` wisdom of groups '' is turned on and accordingly the learning activity of players is strongly driven by the strategies of their neighbors , the evolution is significantly different . here instead of additional roughening due to invading defectors , the interface is actually smoothed as the `` peaks '' of defectors are rapidly suppressed [ panels ( g ) and ( h ) ] .",
    "the result of this process are smooth straight interfaces that bolster the effectiveness of spatial reciprocity , and hence enable the survival of cooperators even at large temptations to defect , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "we note that in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ prepared ] cooperators eventually come to dominate the population completely ( not shown ) .",
    "interestingly , the promotion of cooperation due to the smoothing of interfaces has recently been reported also in the context of the spatial public goods game with adaptive punishment @xcite . here , however , the reason lies not in punishing defectors , but rather in a dynamically modified invasion process , as we will further explain in what follows .    equipped with the insight from the evolution of spatial patterns from a prepared initial state as presented in fig .",
    "[ prepared ] , it is next of interest to investigate the evolution of spatial patterns under the effect of the `` wisdom of groups '' from a random initial state .",
    "figure  [ random ] features a series of snapshots that are characteristic for an evolutionary process that is subject to spatial reciprocity .",
    "cooperators are first rather quickly brought to the brink of extinction [ panel ( b ) ] , only to recuperate rather spectacularly after properly regrouping and forming sufficiently large compact clusters [ panels ( c ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "the final state is a pure @xmath12 phase , which is not shown .",
    "it is important to note that the `` wisdom of groups '' invigorates spatial reciprocity , yet it also requires a more delicate formation of cooperative clusters to begin with .",
    "we emphasize that the majority of small circular @xmath12 domains in panel ( b ) vanishes . only those with `` straight '' borders and of sufficient size form the nucleus from which the reinvasion of cooperators can begin , as depicted in panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the deciding battle between the two competing strategies thus takes place along the interfaces where there are `` steps '' in the straight fronts . here ,",
    "players of both strategies are `` vulnerable '' and susceptible to strategy change because they have relatively high learning activities ( these players are marked with brighter red and blue colors ) , while away from such steps the evolutionary process is significantly decelerated .",
    "although this effect affects as much defectors as it does cooperators , the later are able to draw an evolutionary advantage .",
    "the promotion of cooperation thus relies on the spontaneous emergence of a dynamically decelerated invasion process in the vicinity of straight interfaces .",
    "this is reminiscent of the effect of aging @xcite as well as interdependent networks @xcite , although here it emerges spontaneously due to the `` wisdom of groups '' effect .",
    "the foundations of this effect can be demonstrated nicely at the microscopic level , where the leading invasion processes that are responsible for the evolution along the interfaces can be studied .",
    "top two panels in fig .",
    "[ leading ] show these elementary steps .",
    "due to the introduced neighbor - dependent learning activity , one of the @xmath13 invasions , marked with the gray arrow , becomes negligible at high @xmath0 values , in turn leading to a slight bias in the evolutionary process that supports cooperation .",
    "this can actually be quantified by calculating the difference of invasion probabilities between @xmath14 and @xmath13 transitions for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ leading ] features the results , as obtained for @xmath3 and @xmath11 .",
    "since the average invasion probability is lowered for higher values of @xmath0 , the difference needs to be normalized by an appropriate factor .",
    "more precisely , the plotted quantity @xmath15 that demonstrates the impact of `` wisdom of groups '' is    @xmath16    where @xmath17 } \\,\\ ] ] as the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ leading ] shows , the critical @xmath2 value where the invasion front changes sign is overestimated ( see fig .  [ pdsq ] ) because other processes are neglected by this analysis , yet the fact that this happens at a higher value of @xmath2 for larger values of @xmath0 clearly explains the reported promotion of cooperation due to the `` wisdom of groups '' . as is well - known , it is beneficial for cooperators to be accumulated while the same is not true for defectors .",
    "the revealed dynamics further supports this cause by means of dynamically modified invasion , which is significantly decelerated in the absence of steps along the invasion fronts .",
    "summarizing the results , we have shown that by allowing individuals to exploit the `` wisdom of groups '' helps to resolve social dilemmas , regardless of whether they are described by games governed by pairwise interactions or by games governed by group interactions .",
    "the main assumption has been that the strategy of each individual player is representative for its knowledge , and that accordingly the aggregate information about this for each particular group is representative for the `` wisdom of the group '' .",
    "the later has been taken into account by modifying the learning activity of players . if the strategy of a player has been the same as the strategy of the majority of other players within the group , then its propensity to change it , and accordingly its learning activity , would be low .",
    "conversely , if the strategy has been different , the player would be eager to change it , and accordingly it would had a high learning activity . although the dynamical alteration of learning activities is obviously strategy independent , we have shown that it creates significant evolutionary advantages for the cooperators .",
    "foremost , it slows down the evolutionary process once strategies begin to aggregate .",
    "cooperators are therefore able to build compact clusters with smooth interfaces , while defectors are unable to invade efficiently . on the one hand",
    ", the `` wisdom of groups '' thus reinforces the workings of spatial reciprocity @xcite , and on the other it prevents defectors to utilize their superior fitness in pairwise comparisons with their neighbors .",
    "we have demonstrated this mechanism also at the microscopic level , by comparing the leading invasion process , which is responsible for the evolution along the interfaces , with and without invoking the `` wisdom of groups '' .",
    "we have concluded that the mechanism of cooperation promotion relies on the spontaneous emergence of a dynamically decelerated invasion process , which is conceptually similar as reported previously in the context of aging in evolutionary games @xcite and the evolution of public cooperation on interdependent networks @xcite , yet with the crucial difference that here it emerges spontaneously using a completely different motivational and methodological background .",
    "the study of the `` wisdom of crowds '' , although formally introduced in the past decade @xcite , has roots that go back a whole century @xcite .",
    "although it is accepted that it works in favor of our societies and social welfare @xcite , it is still critically probed , questioned and elaborated upon even today @xcite .",
    "as we hope this study succeeded to demonstrate , evolutionary games provide a theoretical framework that is very much susceptible to this phenomenon , and we hope to have elicit the interest of readers to continue along this line of research .",
    "we consider two different evolutionary games , namely the prisoner s dilemma and the public goods game , on different lattices of size @xmath18 and degree @xmath19 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma is characteristic for games that are governed by pairwise interactions .",
    "it entails cooperators and defectors as the two competing strategies , and it is characterized by the temptation to defect @xmath20 , reward for mutual cooperation @xmath21 , and both the punishment for mutual defection @xmath22 as well as the suckers payoff @xmath23 equaling @xmath24 . as is standard practice , @xmath25 ensures a proper payoff ranking and captures the essential social dilemma between individual and common interests @xcite .",
    "player @xmath26 with strategy @xmath27 acquires its payoff @xmath28 by playing the game pairwise with all its @xmath19 neighbors .",
    "the public goods game , on the other hand , is characteristic for games that are governed by group interactions .",
    "accordingly , players are arranged into overlapping groups of size @xmath29 , such that every player is connected to its @xmath30 nearest neighbors and is a member of @xmath31 different groups . here",
    "players must decide simultaneously whether they wish to contribute to the common pool or not .",
    "all the contributions are then multiplied by a factor @xmath32 to take into account synergetic effects of cooperation , and the resulting amount is divided equally among all @xmath29 group members irrespective of their initial decision . from the perspective of each individual , defection is clearly the rational decision to make , as it yields the highest personal income if compared to other members of the group .",
    "player @xmath26 acquires its payoff @xmath33 by playing the public goods games as a member of the group @xmath34 , whereby its overall payoff is thus @xmath35 .",
    "regardless of the interaction network and the type of the game , initially each individual on site @xmath26 is designated either as a cooperator @xmath36 or defector @xmath37 with equal probability .",
    "the evolutionary process proceeds via the monte carlo simulation procedure , comprising the following elementary steps .",
    "first , a randomly selected player @xmath26 acquires its payoff @xmath28 .",
    "next , player @xmath26 chooses one of its nearest neighbors at random , and the chosen player @xmath38 also acquires its payoff @xmath39 in the same way as previously player @xmath26 .",
    "finally , player @xmath26 can adopt the strategy @xmath40 from player @xmath38 with the probability @xmath41 } \\,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 quantifies the uncertainty by strategy adoptions @xcite ( without loss of generality we use @xmath43 for the prisoner s dilemma and @xmath44 for the public goods game throughout this paper ) , and @xmath45 is the learning activity of player @xmath26 .",
    "each full monte carlo step ( mcs ) gives a chance for every player to change its strategy once on average .",
    "importantly , we take the `` wisdom of groups '' into account by defining the learning activity as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of neighbors that have a different strategy than player @xmath26 and @xmath19 is the degree of the lattice . here",
    "the parameter @xmath0 determines just how seriously the `` wisdom of the group '' is considered . the impact of different @xmath0 values on the learning activity of players is depicted in fig .  [ alpha ] .",
    "it can be observed that for @xmath3 the classical version of the evolutionary game is recovered , where the learning activity is independent of the strategies in the neighborhood , and hence the `` wisdom of groups '' is completely ignored . for @xmath48 , however , the players are increasingly more prone to stick with the strategy that is representative for their nearest neighbors . in fact , the larger the value of @xmath0 , the stronger the feedback between the group and the individual player .",
    "presented results were obtained by means of monte carlo simulations on lattices of linear size @xmath49 .",
    "the necessary relaxation times varied between @xmath50 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that high values of @xmath0 significantly decelerate the evolutionary process , which in turn creates the need for employing extremely long relaxation times ."
