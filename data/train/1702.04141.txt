    "doping of molecular crystals formed by certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules like picene has originated a new class of superconducting materials of very promising characteristics .",
    "the pioneering work of mitsuhashi _",
    "et al._@xcite showed superconductivity of potassium - intercalated picene at 7k or 18k depending on sample processing . later , other pah crystals showing a similar laminar structure in which planes are formed by molecules stacking in a herringbone structure have also shown superconducting properties according to the temperature behavior of magnetic susceptibility .",
    "until now , there is only one report of direct measurement of zero resistivity in this area@xcite . the review by kubozono _",
    "_ provides a good starting point to learn about this emerging field@xcite .",
    "although parallel to the experimental work there have been many theoretical calculations of the electronic structure of potassium - intercalated herringbone structures , a definite consensus on the precise position of dopant potassium atoms has not been reached .",
    "experimental samples are not crystalline enough to allow a precise structural determination using x - ray diffraction .",
    "the lack of this information is particularly relevant when comparing the doping of picene crystals with the doping of pentacene crystalline samples .",
    "both elongate molecules are formed by five benzene rings , picene showing armchair sides that contrast with the zigzag sides of pentacene .",
    "both are stacked in a herringbone layered structure in the pristine crystal .",
    "potassium enters within the pah herringbone structure ( intralayer doping ) where there is space enough for three dopant atoms .",
    "this was the consensus immediately after the discovery of superconducting properties of k - doped picene@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was widely assumed that doping pentacene with alkaline metals only improves conductivity for less than one dopant per pentacene molecule .",
    "potassium , in particular , would occupy interlayer positions donating one electron to pentacene semiconducting bands . in this way , n - type semiconducting behavior could be understood@xcite .",
    "some years later , experiments carried out by mori and ikehata on potassium doped pentacene showed an unusual kind of magnetic transition at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "potassium uptake was near to the 3:1 ratio , but location of potassium atoms was not further investigated@xcite .",
    "quite a few years later , hansson _",
    "conducted the first numerical research on the atomic and electronic structures of potassium - doped pentacene@xcite .",
    "again small doping ( kpentacene@xmath0 ) would correspond to k interlayer positions but larger doping ( kpentacene ) would completely modify the herringbone structure of pristine pentacene : k would penetrate within the pah region mutating the layer structure of the original crystal .",
    "the electronic band structures calculated for both compounds show relatively broad bands that point to a conventional metallic behavior .",
    "unfortunately , subsequent experimental work contradicted this explanation : potassium - intercalated pentacene shows metallic behavior in a broad range of k concentrations ( less than one atom per pentacene molecule ) but not for kpentacene@xcite .",
    "again , the authors of this work supposed that potassium atoms occupy positions in between the molecular herringbone layers of pentacene . when interlayer doping is assumed , there is only place for one k atom per organic molecule because larger amounts of potassium imply too small distances among dopants",
    "actually , the impossibility of having doubly negatively charged pentacene ions was remarked in section iv . of ref",
    ".. however , subsequent experimental works did not recover a mott - hubbard transition as a function of potassium doping but a constant insulator ground state .",
    "used angle - resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy to reach this conclusion by doping of single crystalline pentacene thin films grown on cu(110)@xcite .",
    "roth and knupfer presented electron energy - loss spectroscopy results for potassium doped samples of tetracene and pentacene that were characterized by a finite energy gap in the excitation spectra , i.e. , none of the samples became metallic@xcite .",
    "in the last work , a maximum k doping of two atoms of potassium per pentacene molecule was achieved .",
    "potassium intercalation of pentacene remains unclear until the present moment .",
    "two papers published in 2016 present two quite contradictory scenarios .",
    "_ et al._@xcite report on thin films with the 1:1 stoichiometry .",
    "napthalene , anthracene , tetracene and pentacene are potassium intercalated and all of them show insulating character although the underlying mechanisms are different for short versus long pahs . on the contrary ,",
    "et al._@xcite analyze the properties of a wide range of k intercalated pentacene samples and observe superconductivity for a large 3:1 stoichiometry .",
    "the crystalline structure of the superconducting phase is no longer triclinic but monoclinic .",
    "definitely , potassium intercalation of pentacene calls for some clarification .",
    "most probably , important differences must be associated to structural differences of samples that are synthesized in different ways .",
    "therefore , theoretical band structure calculations based on well defined crystalline structures can help to understand different possible scenarios . moreover , although the prediction capabilities of density functional theory ( dft ) are not absolute , the possibility of comparing several structures analyzed with exactly the same approach provides important advantages . in our work",
    ", we have systematically investigated all the suggested crystalline structures of potassium intercalated pentacene emphasizing low doping level ( just one k atom per pentacene molecule ) and the greatest plausible doping level ( tree k atoms per pentacene molecule ) .",
    "the possible appearance of magnetic instabilities that can drive the compound to an insulating phase have been taken into account in our investigation . in this way",
    ", a set of well converged crystalline phases that bear all the structural motives described so far in the literature has been produced and sorted by their final cell energies .",
    "they have been collected as _ cif _",
    "files in the supplemental material@xcite . in particular ,",

    "potassium does always enter into the herringbone structure of the pristine pentacene crystal in an intralayer manner .",
    "other structural alternatives like interlayer doping produce higher values of the cell energy .",
    "extra electrons populate pentacene lumo firstly and pentacene lumo+1 afterward .",
    "simultaneously , they lead to a subtle molecular rearrangement of the herringbone structure that maximizes symmetry and produces very narrow bands . therefore ,",
    "important correlation effects have to be expected that open the door to either magnetic insulating phases as shown in our work or more exotic solutions .",
    "on the other hand , kinetically driven reaction pathways may make it possible the stabilization of a new monoclinic structure showing about 0.77 ev higher energy per cell . if this happened , our results point to a metallic band structure for this crystalline phase . in any case , a detailed experimental determination of the structure of doped pentacene is needed before closing the quest for a metal based on this pah .",
