    "the most recent super kamiokande ( super k. ) results for the study of atmospheric neutrinos and the neutrino anomaly before the large accident of the detector have been presented for the 79.3 kiloton - year ( kty ) exposure by kajita and totsuka  @xcite and at the 27th international cosmic ray conference , hamburg , august 2001  @xcite . using their reports ,",
    "we have compared the respective intensities / kty as shown in table 1 for the sub - gev results ( visible energy , @xmath6 < 1330 mev ) and for the multi - gev results ( @xmath6 > 1330 mev ) .",
    "these results are subdivided into exposures of 25.5 kty(analysis a ) and 25.8 kty(analysis b )  @xcite , also 33.0 kty  @xcite and 46.3 ( @xmath7 ) kty  @xcite , as given in the published papers and reports .",
    "table [ table : table1 ] shows a comparison of various event samples for @xmath2-like event numbers , @xmath3-like event numbers , ( @xmath2-like+@xmath3-like ) numbers and the ratio for ( @xmath2-like number)/(@xmath3-like number ) in the sub - gev and multi - gev regions  @xcite .",
    "the actual event numbers are shown in the second and the fourth column .",
    "disagreements between the related two exposures are indicated by respective identifier marks .",
    "earlier data for the sub - gev region collected during the period from may 1996 to october 1997 have been analysed independently by group a for the exposure of 25.5 kty and group b for the exposure of 25.8 kty , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the comparisons are shown in the upper part in table [ table : table1 ] .",
    "both the event rates per kty for @xmath3-like number , ( @xmath2-like number + @xmath3-like number ) and the ratio for ( @xmath2-like number)/(@xmath3-like number ) appear to be in conflict above the respective statistical uncertainties .",
    "therefore , our main purpose for the present considerations is to compare those event rates for both exposures .",
    "the systematic uncertainties depend on the different kty values , but they are smaller than the statistical ones",
    ".    in both a and b groups , the event rates for @xmath3-like event numbers marked by @xmath8 and for ( @xmath2-like + @xmath3-like ) event numbers marked by @xmath9 in the sub - gev range do not agree .",
    "also , the ratios for ( @xmath2-like)/(@xmath3-like ) events marked by @xmath10 are inconsistent in spite of the fact that the same data sample is analysed .",
    "however , the super k. group finally has considered only the result of analysis a disregarding analysis b which has given larger number of @xmath3-like events than analysis a.    .comparisons of various event samples for sub - gev and multi - gev in the super kamiokande detector . [ cols=\"<,>,^,>,<,>,<,^,>,^,>,<,>,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is generally known that a significance probability ( s.p . ) of @xmath11 0.05 in a statistical test indicates consistency for the two data sets . in the present cases , also , s.p .",
    "values of little larger than 0.05 may indicate some degrees of mis - identification . in the following",
    "we carefully check the variances of the s.p .",
    "values of the respective distributions . in table",
    "[ table : chitab ] , a small s.p .",
    "value of 0.068 was seen for the upward directed zenith angle distribution of sub - gev @xmath2-like events .",
    "further , in multi - gev @xmath2-like events , we found an extremely rare s.p .",
    "value = 0.017 for the whole zenith angle distribution .",
    "the downward directed events were also described by a s.p.= 0.044 which was smaller than 0.05 , and the upward directed one of s.p.= 0.13 was smaller than the other upward directed ones except for the sub - gev @xmath2-like events .",
    "although multi - gev @xmath3-like ( fc + pc ) events showed very large s.p .",
    "values for all the distributions , the downward - directed fc events could only be characterized by a s.p .",
    "value of 0.073 .",
    "however , all distributions of the pc events show large s.p .",
    "these varying results might be connected to the identification problem of muons and electrons .    for testing our s.p .",
    "values , we used the upward through - going muon flux and the upward - going stopping events in @xmath4 expressed with 10 bins for the former and 5 bins for the latter of the 79.3 kty exposure .",
    "both these events are sure to be muons as they are irrelevant to the identification of muons and electrons .",
    "similar @xmath12 tests were done for both distributions expressed by 5 bins each from the subdivision of the 79.3 kty exposure into the respective 33.0 kty and 46.3 kty exposures . from these data",
    ", we obtained s.p .",
    "values of 0.66 for 5 bins for the upward through - going muon flux , and a s.p .",
    "value of 0.37 for 5 bins in the upward - going stopping events .",
    "these s.p .",
    "values are not in conflict with being muons . from this",
    "we infer that the poor s.p .",
    "values shown in table [ table : chitab ] 5 , for some of the zenith angle distributions of @xmath2-like and of @xmath3-like events in the sub - gev and multi - gev ranges and also for the downward directed @xmath3-like ( fc ) events , may be connected to the poor identification capability for muons and electrons in the 33 kty and 46.3 kty exposures .",
    "thus , we come to the conclusion that these events may show an appreciate mis - identification between muons and electrons .    accordingly , the comparison of the observed zenith angle distribution of various events with the expected one based on the neutrino oscillation hypothesis is still an open question .",
    "in addition , the comparisons of the upward - going muon flux with the null and the @xmath13 neutrino oscillation hypothesis have to face the problem about the absolute value of the neutrino and muon fluxes at ground level for different zenith angles .",
    "namely , very recently , the measurement of atmospheric vertical muon fluxes at ground level in the momentum ranges from 200 mev/@xmath14 to 120 gev/@xmath14 by the caprice group  @xcite and from 0.6 to 20 gev/@xmath14 by the bess group  @xcite were done by using low mass superconducting magnet spectrometers .",
    "the former are about 10 % to 15 % lower and the latter about 20 % lower than the previous experimental results .",
    "the okayama group  @xcite using a solid iron magnet telescope has obtained the vertical muon fluxes from 1.5 to 100 gev/@xmath14 which are consistent with both the above measurements . also , the nmsu - wizard / caprice98  @xcite balloon - borne magnetic spectrometer reports new measurements at several atmospheric depths in the momentum range 0.3 - 20 gev/@xmath14 .",
    "based on our mc simulation which includes fluctuations of the produced number of photoelectrons due to the stochastic nature of energy - loss mechanisms , we conclude that the total mis - identification rate for muon and electron events is larger than or equal to 20 % in the sub - gev region and also at least several % in the multi - gev region . in both cases",
    "the correct treatment of the particle identification would lead to an increase of the muon neutrino flux , namely of 20 % in the sub - gev range and 5 % in the multi - gev region . among others ,",
    "this mis - identification problem is related to the fact that electrons will always initiate electromagnetic cascades leading to a fuzzy image of the erenkov ring pattern . on the other hand muons",
    "can occasionally undergo electromagnetic interactions ( knock - on production , bremsstrahlung and direct electron pair production ) . in these cases the muon track overlaps with the shower initiated by the secondaries created by the muon .",
    "the emerging pattern can easily be mistaken for an electron .",
    "in addition , our @xmath12 tests showed that the zenith angle distributions observed by super k. for @xmath2-like and @xmath3-like ( fc ) , except @xmath3-like ( pc ) events in the first half of the total exposure of 79.3 kty ( 33.0 kty ) and the second half ( 46.3 kty ) are inconsistent both for the sub - gev and multi - gev ranges .",
    "in special , very different s.p .",
    "values between 0.99 and 0.073 for both observed zenith angle distributions of upward - directed and downward - directed @xmath3-like ( fc ) events suggest that the downward going events suffer from mis - identifications between muons and electrons . given these results ,",
    "we conclude that due to the uncertainty of the identification capability for muon and electron events in the super k. detector one can not yet firmly establish the existence of an atmospheric neutrino anomaly . a better knowledge and precision treatment of the particle identification technique including discussions of the absolute intensities for the zenith angle dependent upward going events and the accurate atmospheric neutrino fluxes in general will certainly help to resolve the remaining problems .",
    "we wish to express our thanks to professor claus grupen of university of siegen for polishing the english sentences .",

    "<S> in the measurement of atmospheric @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluxes , the calculations of the super kamiokande group for the distinction between muon - like and electron - like events observed in the water erenkov detector have initially assumed a mis - identification probability of less than 1 % and later 2 % for the sub - gev range . in the multi - gev range , they compared only the observed behaviors of ring patterns of muon and electron events , and claimed a 3 % mis - identification . </S>",
    "<S> however , the expressions and the calculation method do not include the fluctuation properties due to the stochastic nature of the processes which determine the expected number of photoelectrons ( p.e . ) produced by muons and electrons . </S>",
    "<S> our full monte carlo ( mc ) simulations including the fluctuations of photoelectron production show that the total mis - identification rate for electrons and muons should be larger than or equal to 20 % for sub - gev region . even in the multi - gev region </S>",
    "<S> we expect a mis - identification rate of several % based on our mc simulations taking into account the ring patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the mis - identified events are mostly of muonic origin .    comparing the intensities per kiloton - year between the 33 kiloton - year ( the first half of the total exposure of 79.3 kty ) and 46.3 kton - year ( the latter half ) exposures , moreover , the respective values for @xmath2-like event numbers , @xmath3-like event numbers and the ratio for ( @xmath2-like number)/(@xmath3-like number ) are not consistent within the given statistical uncertainties in the sub - gev and multi - gev regions for the two subsamples . </S>",
    "<S> it should be also remarked that results for the whole zenith angle distributions of e - like and of @xmath3-like events in the sub - gev ranges and those of @xmath2-like and @xmath3-like(fc ) events in the multi - gev ranges are inconsistent for the 33 kton - year and 46.3 kton - year exposures . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the significance probability of the results after subdividing the whole zenith angle distribution into upward ( @xmath4 ) and downward ( @xmath5 ) going events . </S>",
    "<S> their significance probabilities also support our claim that the method used by the super k. group is inadequate for the identification of muons and electrons . </S>"
