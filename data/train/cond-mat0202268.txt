    "the study of electrical and mechanical stability of disordered systems is attracting a considerable interest in the recent literature @xcite@xmath5@xcite because of its implications on both material technology @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6 @xcite@xmath5@xcite and fundamental aspects related to the response of these systems to high external stresses @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath5@xcite .",
    "indeed , the application of a finite stress ( electrical or mechanical ) to a disordered material generally implies a nonlinear response , which ultimately leads to an irreversible breakdown ( catastrophic behavior ) in the high stress limit @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xcite .",
    "such catastrophic phenomena have been successfully studied by using percolation theories @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6 @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "critical phenomena near the percolation threshold have been widely investigated in the electrical breakdown of granular metals or conductor - insulator composites @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6 @xcite@xmath5@xcite .",
    "the associated critical exponents have been measured @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6 @xcite and theoretically studied using continuum or lattice percolation models @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath5@xcite . in particular , large attention has been devoted to the critical exponents describing the resistance and its relative noise in terms of the medium properties ( e.g. conducting particle fraction , defect concentration , etc . )",
    "@xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath6 @xcite@xmath5@xcite .",
    "however , very few attempts @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xcite have been made so far to describe the behavior of a disordered medium over the full range of the applied stress , i.e. by studying the response of the system to an external bias when the bias strength covers the full range of linear and nonlinear regimes .",
    "therefore , a satisfactory understanding of breakdown phenomena over the full dynamical regime is still missing @xcite@xmath6@xcite . on the other hand , relevant information can be obtained from such a study , like : precursor phenomena , role of the disorder , existence of scaling laws , predictability of breakdown , etc . @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xcite .    here",
    "we present a percolative model of sufficient generality to address the above issues .",
    "our aim is to provide a theoretical framework to study response and fluctuation phenomena under linear and nonlinear regimes in a wide class of disordered systems . to this purpose",
    ", we study the evolution of a random resistor network ( rrn ) in which two competing processes are present , defect generation and defect recovery , which determine the values of the elementary network resistances .",
    "both processes are driven by the joint effect of an electrical bias and of the heat exchange between the network and the thermal bath .",
    "the bias is applied through a constant voltage or , alternatively , a constant current .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are performed to investigate the network evolution in the full range of bias values .",
    "depending on the bias strength , an irreversible failure or a stationary state of the rrn can be achieved . by focusing on the steady - state",
    ", we analyze the behavior of the average network resistance , @xmath2 , and the properties of the resistance fluctuations as a function of the bias . in constant voltage conditions",
    ", a scaling relation is found between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath3 is the linear regime resistance and @xmath4 the threshold value for the onset of nonlinearity .",
    "a similar relation is found in constant current conditions .",
    "the relative variance of resistance fluctuations also exhibits a strong nonlinearity in the pre - breakdown regime whose properties are discussed . the fluctuation analysis is completed by a further investigation of the noise resistance spectrum and of the gaussian features of the fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "theoretical results agree with electrical breakdown measurements in thin films of composites @xcite and of other conducting @xcite or insulating materials @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we briefly describe the model used .",
    "section 3 presents the results of the mc simulations for the resistance and its fluctuations .",
    "the main conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "we study a two - dimensional random resistor network of total resistance @xmath7 , made of @xmath8 resistors , each of resistance @xmath9 , disposed on a square lattice .",
    "we take a square geometry , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 determines the linear size of the lattice , with the total number of resistors being @xmath12 . for the comparison with resistivity measurements in thin films ,",
    "the value of @xmath11 can be related to the ratio between the size of the sample and the average size of the grains composing the sample .",
    "an external bias , represented by a constant voltage @xmath13 or by a constant current @xmath14 , is applied to the rrn through electrical contacts realized by perfectly conducting bars at the left and right hand sides of the network .",
    "a current @xmath15 is then flowing through each resistor .",
    "the rrn interacts with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath16 and the resistances @xmath9 are taken to depend linearly on the local temperatures , @xmath17 , as : @xmath18 \\label{eq : tcr}\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath19 is the temperature coefficient of the resistance and @xmath17 is calculated by adopting a biased percolation model @xcite as : @xmath20 \\label{eq : temp}\\ ] ] here , @xmath21 is the number of first neighbours around the n_th _ resistor , the parameter @xmath22 , measured in ( k / w ) , describes the heat coupling of each resistor with the thermal bath and it determines the importance of joule heating effects .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is taken to be equal to @xmath24 to provide a uniform heating in the perfect network configuration .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) implies an instantaneous thermalization of each resistor at the value @xmath17 , therefore , by adopting eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) , for simplicity we are neglecting time dependent effects which are discussed in ref . [ ] .    in the initial state of the network ( corresponding to the perfect network configuration with no heating )",
    "all the resistors are identical : @xmath25 .",
    "now , we assume that two competing percolative processes act to determine the rrn evolution .",
    "the first process consists of generating fully insulating defects ( resistors with very high resistance , i.e. broken resistors ) with probability @xcite @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is an activation energy characteristic of the defect and @xmath28 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the second process consists of recovering the insulating defects with probability @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an activation energy characteristic of this second process . for @xmath31 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) implies that both the processes ( defect generation and defect recovery ) are correlated percolations .",
    "indeed , the probability of breaking ( recovering ) a resistor is higher in the so called `` hot spots '' of the rrn @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath32 eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) yields @xmath33 , which corresponds to random percolations @xcite .",
    "the same is true for vanishing small bias values , when joule heating effects are negligible .    as a result of the competition between these two percolations and depending on the parameters related to the particular physical system ( @xmath27 , @xmath30 , @xmath22 , @xmath19 , @xmath34 , @xmath11 ) and on the external conditions ( specified by the bias conditions and the bath temperature ) , the rrn reaches a steady state or exhibits an irreversible breakdown . in the first case",
    ", the network resistance fluctuates around an average value @xmath2 . in the second case ,",
    "a critical fraction of defects @xmath35 , corresponding to the percolation threshold , is reached , i.e. @xmath7 diverges due to the existence of at least one continuous path of defects between the upper and lower sides of the network @xcite .",
    "we note that in the limit of a vanishing bias ( random percolation ) and infinite lattices ( @xmath36 ) , the expression : @xmath37 $ ] provides a sufficient condition for the existence of a steady state @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the rrn is obtained by mc simulations carried out according to the following iterative procedure .",
    "( i ) starting from the perfect lattice with given local currents , the local temperatures @xmath17 are calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) ; ( ii ) the defects are generated with probability @xmath38 and the resistances of the unbroken resistors are changed as specified by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcr ] ) ; ( iii ) the currents @xmath15 are calculated by solving kirchhoff s loop equations by the gauss elimination method and the local temperatures are updated ; ( iv ) the defects are recovered with probability @xmath39 and the temperature dependence of unbroken resistors is again accounted for ; ( v ) @xmath7 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 are finally calculated and the procedure is iterated from ( ii ) until one of the two following possibilities is achieved .",
    "in the first , the percolation threshold is reached . in the second",
    ", the rrn attains a steady state ; in this case the iteration runs long enough to allow a fluctuation analysis to be carried out .",
    "each iteration step can be associated with an elementary time step on an appropriate time scale ( to be calibrated with experiments ) . in this manner",
    "it is possible to represent the simulation of the resistance evolution over either a time or a frequency domain according to convenience .    in the simulations , as reasonable values of the parameters , we have taken : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( k@xmath43 ) , @xmath44 ( k / w ) , @xmath45 ( ev ) , @xmath46 ( ev ) , and @xmath47 ( k ) if not stated otherwise .",
    "the values of the external bias range from @xmath48 ( a ) under constant current conditions , and from @xmath49 ( v ) under constant voltage conditions .",
    "figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b ) report a sampling of the resistance evolutions coming out from the simulations under steady state conditions for the cases of constant voltage ( fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ) and constant current ( fig . 1 ( b ) ) , respectively . at increasing the external bias ,",
    "a remarkable increase of the average resistance and of the amplitude of fluctuations is evident in both cases while approaching the breakdown .",
    "this is reached by applying an external bias just above the highest values shown in these figures .",
    "precisely , the rrn becomes unstable under constant voltage already by applying a voltage just above @xmath50 ( v ) and , under constant current , by applying a current just above @xmath51 ( a ) .    in the following , figs .",
    "2 to 4 will detail the behavior of the average resistance while figs . 5 to 10 will focus on the results of resistance fluctuations .",
    "figure 2 reports the average value of the rrn resistance as a function of the applied bias ( current or voltage ) .",
    "each value is calculated by considering the time average on a single steady - state realization and then averaging over 20 independent realizations ( rrns subjected to the same bias conditions ) .",
    "the numerical uncertainty is found to be within 0.01% at worst . at the lowest biases the resistance takes a value @xmath3 which represents the intrinsic linear response property of the network ( ohmic regime ) @xcite .",
    "we note that for the activation energy values here chosen , the average fraction of defects at the lowest bias @xmath52 is very small ( @xmath53 ) so that @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) is about 1% greater than the perfect network resistance . under constant current conditions ,",
    "when the current overcomes a certain value , @xmath56 , the average resistance starts to become dependent on the bias .",
    "thus , @xmath56 sets the current scale value for the onset of nonlinearity . by adopting as criterium for the onset of nonlinearity a resistance increase of @xmath57 over the linear response value , we determine @xmath58 ( a ) . for currents above",
    "@xmath56 the resistance increase is smooth at moderate bias and it exhibits a sharp ramp ( typical of a catastrophic behavior ) at high bias , until a threshold current value @xmath59 ( a ) above which the rrn undergoes an irreversible breakdown .",
    "a step of current values @xmath60 ( a ) has been used to determine @xmath61 , thus this value of @xmath62 gives the maximum uncertainty on @xmath61 .",
    "accordingly , we have found @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the last stable value of the resistance calculated before the breakdown .",
    "we remark that the uncertainty on the ratio @xmath66 is mainly due to the uncertainty on @xmath65 which reflects , amplified by the nonlinearity , the uncertainty on @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , under constant voltage conditions we have found @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 ( v ) and @xmath70 ( v ) are the voltage values corresponding respectively to the nonlinearity onset and to the electrical breakdown .",
    "the maximum uncertainty on @xmath71 is @xmath72 ( v ) .",
    "the significantly higher value of the ratio @xmath73 , when compared with that of the ratio @xmath74 , is a quantitative indication that the system is more robust when biased under constant voltage than under constant current conditions .",
    "this property is further emphasized by the fact that the increase of the resistance in the pre - breakdown region exhibits a lower slope under constant voltage than under constant current conditions . it must be noticed that in spite of the significant difference of the ratios @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    ", the ratio @xmath66 remains the same , within the error , under the different bias conditions .",
    "this result agrees with measurements of the ratio @xmath66 performed in composites under the joule regime @xcite .    to better analyze the dependence on the bias of the average resistance , figs .",
    "3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) report the log - log plot of the relative variation of the resistance as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "figure 3 ( a ) shows that the relative variation of the average resistance scales with the ratio @xmath1 in the whole region of applied voltages up to breakdown as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a dimensionless coefficient and @xmath78 .",
    "figure 3 ( b ) shows that also under constant current the relative variation of the average resistance scales with the ratio @xmath75 in the moderate bias region , as : @xmath79 with @xmath80 and the same exponent @xmath81 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : res_v ] ) , within numerical uncertainty . however , in this case we notice that in the pre - breakdown region the relative variation of the average resistance exhibits a superquadratic behavior characterized by a power law @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "this behavior of the average resistance with the applied bias can be understood as follows . from a macroscopic point of view , in a degradation process associated with a resistance increase , constant current conditions lead , at increasing bias , to a superquadratic increase of the power dissipated through joule heating and thus to a major efficiency in the defect generation . by contrast ,",
    "constant voltage conditions lead , at increasing bias , to a growth of the dissipated power which is subquadratic in the applied voltage , thus implying a minor efficiency in the generation of defects . in this respect",
    ", it must be underlined that the resistance increase driven by both kind of bias is further enhanced by the positive value of the temperature coefficient of the resistance .    from a microscopic point of view",
    ", the rrn resistance depends on the average fraction of defects , @xmath84 , according to the expression @xcite : @xmath85 where , for biased percolation , @xmath35 and @xmath86 are functions of the bias strength @xcite .",
    "of course , for vanishing bias , @xmath35 and @xmath86 take the well known values corresponding to random percolation : @xmath87 ( for a square lattice ) and @xmath88 ( universal value ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the dependence of @xmath35 and @xmath86 on the bias makes the analysis of @xmath2 in terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : res_scal ] ) quite problematic . nevertheless , it is interesting to analyze the behavior of @xmath84 on the bias strength and , to this purpose , fig .",
    "4 reports on a log - log plot the relative variation of @xmath84 as a function of the normalized bias . as evidenced by the figure , for the case of constant voltage conditions the average fraction of defects scales with the same exponent @xmath81 over the full range of bias values , as : @xmath89 with @xmath90 a dimensionless coefficient .",
    "a similar expression holds under constant current conditions at moderate bias : @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "however , under constant current , there is a significant increase of the slope in the pre - breakdown region up to a nearly above cubic power law .",
    "the behavior of the average fraction of defects in the moderate bias region can be understood by generalising the results obtained for random stationary percolations @xcite to the presence of a moderate external bias responsible of joule heating .",
    "in fact , for a rnn in a stationary state resulting from the competition of two random percolations , it has been found @xcite that @xmath93 , with @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the probabilities defined in section ii with @xmath33 . at moderate bias ,",
    "when the defect distribution is rather homogeneous and the variation of @xmath2 small , we can take @xmath97 with @xmath98 , where in the spirit of a mean - field theory , the average temperature increase can be expressed as @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , by differentiating : @xmath100 which by simple manipulation gives : @xmath101_0 }   \\left ( { dx \\over dt } \\right)_0 \\right ] \\left ( { i \\over i_0 } \\right ) ^2   \\label{eq : rel_p}\\ ] ] the term in the squared brackets of eq .  ( [ eq : rel_p ] ) can thus be identified with the @xmath102 coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pscal_i ] ) .",
    "in fact , by introducing the parameters used in the simulations we find for the squared brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel_p ] ) the value @xmath103 which well agrees with the previous reported value of @xmath102 . for constant voltage",
    "the factor @xmath104 inside eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel_p ] ) must be replaced with @xmath105 .",
    "this gives for the square bracket in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel_p ] ) the value of @xmath106 , which again well agrees with the value of @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pscal_v ] ) .",
    "therefore , at moderate bias , the quadratic behavior of @xmath84 is well explained by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel_p ] ) . in the pre - breakdown region ,",
    "under constant current conditions , the significant increase of the resistance and the defect filamentation characteristic of biased percolation @xcite add to give a superquadratic increase of @xmath84 with the bias .",
    "by contrast , under constant voltage , these two effects act in an opposed manner , thus their compensation results in a quadratic dependence of @xmath84 over the full range of bias values .    from the above behavior of the average defect fraction",
    "we can now understand the bias dependence of @xmath2 . at moderate bias ( @xmath75 or @xmath108 )",
    "the increase of @xmath2 is rather small .",
    "accordingly , super and subquadratic effects on the dissipated power are negligible and the average fraction of defects over the intrinsic value grows quadratically with the bias strength ( eq .  ( [ eq : rel_p ] ) ) ; at these bias values @xmath109 thus @xmath110 and also the average resistance grows quadratically with bias . at high bias ( i.e. @xmath75 or @xmath111 ) ,",
    "when entering the pre - breakdown region , the increase of @xmath2 is significant . accordingly ,",
    "super and subquadratic effects on the dissipated power are relevant as well as the increase of the average fraction of defects which now takes a nonuniform distribution ( biased percolation ) . as a consequence",
    ", the percolation threshold is lowered with respect to the random percolation value @xcite .",
    "depending on constant current or constant voltage conditions , this biased percolation effect adds to further enhancing the increase of the resistance well above the quadratic law or to keep the quadratic behavior , respectively .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by mc simulations performed with the same parameters but setting the temperature coefficient of the resistance @xmath112 . in this case",
    ", we have found that the onset of nonlinearity as well as the electrical breakdown occur at higher values of the bias .",
    "precisely we have found @xmath113 ( a ) , @xmath114 ( a ) ( thus @xmath115 ) , @xmath116 under constant current and @xmath117 ( v ) , @xmath118 ( v ) ( thus @xmath119 ) and @xmath120 under constant voltage conditions .",
    "the quadratic regime is always present at moderate bias values .",
    "however , in the pre - breakdown regime we have found @xmath121 for constant current and @xmath122 for constant voltage conditions , respectively .",
    "we finally conclude this section by remarking that the behavior described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : res_v ] ) and  ( [ eq : res_i ] ) well agrees with measurements of the resistance of composites made in the joule regime up to breakdown @xcite .",
    "it is well known that important information about the properties and the stability of different systems ( physical , biological , social , etc . )",
    "can be obtained by studying the fluctuations around the average value of some characteristic quantities of the system @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6 @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xcite@xmath5@xcite .",
    "several features of the fluctuations are usually considered , and among these , the most important are the variance ( or the relative variance ) , the power spectrum and the gaussianity property . here",
    ", we analyze the fluctuations of the rnn resistance in the full range of bias values , devoting particular attention to the features that can be identified as failure precursors .",
    "figure 5 reports the relative variance of resistance fluctuations , @xmath123 , as a function of the applied bias .",
    "the data correspond to the same simulations presented in fig .",
    "the same procedure of time averaging over a single simulation and then making ensemble averages over @xmath124 realizations provides an uncertainty of @xmath125 at worst . at low bias",
    ", the relative variance is found to achieve a constant value @xmath126 .",
    "this value represents an intrinsic property of the system determined by the competition of two random percolations , as already discussed for the case of the resistance .",
    "a detailed analysis of the scaling properties of @xmath127 can be found in ref . [ ] . at increasing bias , when @xmath128 or @xmath129 , the systematic increase of @xmath130 reveals the existence of a nonlinear regime of the response . similarly to the behavior of the resistance , by approaching the electrical breakdown @xmath130 exhibits a significant increase which is steeper under constant current than under constant voltage conditions .",
    "this feature is ascribed to the better stability of the rrn under constant voltage , since resistance fluctuations in excess over the mean value are damped in this condition . by contrast , the same kind of fluctuations are enhanced under constant current conditions . to detail the dependence of @xmath130 on the bias , we have reported in fig . 6 ( a ) its relative variation , @xmath131/\\sigma_0 $ ] , as a function of @xmath1 under constant voltage conditions .",
    "two regions can be identified in the nonlinear regime : a moderate bias region ( @xmath132 ) , characterized by a quadratic dependence on the applied voltage , and a pre - breakdown region at the highest voltages ( @xmath133 ) , where a superquadratic dependence up to a cubic power law is evidenced .",
    "accordingly , in the first region it is : @xmath134 with @xmath135 a dimensionless coefficient , while in the second region we have found : @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath130 under constant voltage conditions should be compared with that of the average resistance which remains always a quadratic function up to the breakdown , as shown in fig .",
    "the emergence of a superquadratic behavior of @xmath130 in the pre - breakdown region reflects the higher sensitivity of the resistance fluctuations with respect to the average value of the resistance to the instability of the network .",
    "the same analysis performed for the case of constant current is shown in fig .",
    "6 ( b ) . again",
    ", at moderate bias @xmath138/\\sigma_0 $ ] increases quadratically with the current as : @xmath139 with @xmath140 a dimensionless coefficient . on the other hand",
    ", the superquadratic dependence characterizes the pre - breakdown region as : @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "we note , that @xmath143 is significantly greater than @xmath144 , according to the behaviors shown in fig .",
    "moreover , @xmath143 is greater than the resistance exponent in the pre - breakdown region @xmath145 .",
    "it is noteworthy , that by neglecting the effect of the temperature coefficient of the resistance , i.e. by taking @xmath112 , the moderate bias region remains characterized by a a quadratic increase which is common to both constant current and constant voltage conditions .",
    "however , in the pre - breakdown region we have found @xmath146 .",
    "thus , the above results prove that the quadratic dependence of @xmath130 on the bias in the moderate bias region is a feature independent of the conditions on which the bias is applied and also independent of the value of the thermal coefficient of the resistance .",
    "this reflects the fact that at moderate bias the two following conditions are satisfied : i ) the variation of the average fraction of defects follows eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel_p ] ) ; ii ) the average fraction of defects is much smaller than the percolation threshold value , i.e. @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , in this nearly perfect regime @xmath148 @xcite . on the other hand , the superquadratic behavior of @xmath130 in the pre - breakdown region is a consequence of the fact that at high biases the local correlations in the defect generation and recovery processes become strong .",
    "defect filamentation , characteristic of biased percolation @xcite , implies that a small variation in the number of defects bring strong resistance fluctuations .",
    "figure 7 reports the relative variance of resistance fluctuations normalized to the linear regime value as a function of the normalized resistance .",
    "we can see that the former quantity exhibits an increase over nearly two orders of magnitude in the same range of bias where the latter quantity increases for about @xmath149 only . the log - log plot of @xmath150/\\sigma$ ] as a function of @xmath151/<r>_0 $ ] , shown in fig .",

    "the emergence of a non - gaussian behavior near the breakdown , in agreement with experiments @xcite@xmath6@xcite , can be considered a relevant precursor of failure .",

    "the relative variance of resistance fluctuations we have found that at moderate bias ( @xmath158 ) it grows quadratically with the bias , independently of constant - current or constant - voltage conditions . on the other hand a superquadratic dependence appears in the pre - breakdown region .",
    "the presence of two distinct regions in the nonlinear regime has been explained in the following terms . at moderate bias",
    "there is a small joule heating giving rise to the competitions of two nearly random percolations and to a small variation of the rrn resistance . at high bias ,",
    "local correlations typical of biased percolation become important .",
    "moreover , also the resistance variation becomes strong .",
    "therefore , as a consequence of both these effects the resistance noise depends superquadratically on the bias .",
    "the power spectral density of resistance fluctuations is found to exhibit a lorentzian spectrum and in the pre - breakdown region the amplitude of fluctuations shows the onset of non - gaussian behaviors .",
    "theoretical results agree qualitatively , and in some cases quantitatively , with breakdown experiments performed in composites @xcite@xmath6@xcite and in other conducting @xcite@xmath6@xcite or nonconducting materials @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the study of the stationary state of a rrn , resulting from the competition of biased percolations , provides an unifying framework for the interpretation of several non - linear transport phenomena in a variety of disordered systems .",
