    "the decays of charm mesons are currently a new source of information for the study of light meson spectroscopy , with the advantages of having well defined initial state ( the @xmath8 meson , a @xmath9 state with defined mass ) .",
    "this new information is complementary to that from scattering experiments and can be particularly relevant to the understanding of the scalar sector .    here",
    "we present preliminary results for the dalitz - plot analysis of the cabibbo - favored decay using data from fermilab e791 experiment .",
    "we also present an overview of our results for 3pi @xcite and 3pi @xcite dalitz - plot analyses .",
    "the e791 data was collected in 1991/92 from 500 gev / c @xmath10-nucleon interactions . for details",
    "see @xcite .    for the analysis ,",
    "when we include all known @xmath11 resonant channels plus a non - resonant ( nr ) contribution , we find that the nr decay is dominant .",
    "this is unusual in @xmath8 decays .",
    "moreover , the fit model has important discrepancies with respect to the data . by including an extra scalar resonant state , with unconstrained mass and width",
    ", we obtain a fit which is substantially superior to that without this state .",
    "the values for its mass and width are found to be @xmath12 mev / c@xmath13 and @xmath14 mev / c@xmath13 respectively .",
    "we refer to this state as the @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of such a state has been greatly discussed in the literature in recent years @xcite@xcite .",
    "we also obtain new measurements for the mass and the width of the 14 resonance : @xmath15 mev / c@xmath13 and @xmath16 mev / c@xmath13 respectively",
    ".    from our analysis of 3pi decays , we find that the dominant decay fraction comes from @xmath17 .",
    "we obtain new measurements for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 masses and widths . from 3pi",
    "decays , we find that a model with only known @xmath20 resonances plus a nr channel is not able to describe the data adequately .",
    "we find strong evidence for the presence of a light and broad scalar resonance , the @xmath21 , the @xmath22 channel being responsible for half of the decay rate .",
    "we measure the mass and the width of this scalar meson to be @xmath23 mev/@xmath24 and @xmath25 mev/@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "from the original @xmath26 events collected by e791 , and after reconstruction and selection criteria , we obtained the sample shown in figure  [ kpipi](a ) .",
    "the filled area represents the level of background ; besides the combinatorial , the other main source of background comes from the reflection of the decay @xmath27 ( through @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the crosshatched region contains the events selected for the dalitz - plot analysis .",
    "there are 15090 events in this sample , of which 6% are background .",
    "figure  [ kpipi](b ) shows the dalitz - plot for these events .",
    "the two axes are the squared invariant - mass combinations for @xmath11 , and the plot is symmetrized with respect to the two identical pions .",
    "the plot presents a rich structure , where we can observe the clear bands from @xmath30 , and an accumulation of events at the upper edge of the diagonal , due to heavier resonances . to study the resonant substructure",
    ", we perform an unbinned maximun - likelihood fit to the data , with probability distribution funtions ( pdf s ) for both signal and background sources .",
    "in particular , for each candidate event , the signal pdf is written as the square of the total physical amplitude @xmath31 ( defined below ) and it is weighted for the acceptance across the dalitz plot ( obtained by monte carlo ( mc ) ) and by the level of signal to background for each event , as given by the line shape of figure  [ kpipi](a ) .",
    "the background pdf s ( levels and shapes ) are fixed for the dalitz - plot fit , according to mc and data studies .",
    "( -400,180)(a)(-170,180)(b )    we begin describing our first approach to fit the data , which represents the conventional dalitz - plot analysis including the known @xmath11 resonant amplitudes ( @xmath32 ) , plus a constant non - resonant contribution . the signal amplitude is constructed as a coherent sum of the various sub - channels : @xmath33 each resonant amplitude is written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the relativistic breit - wigner propagator @xmath36 with mass dependent width , @xmath37 the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the blatt - weisskopf damping factors respectively for the @xmath8 and the @xmath11 resonances , they depend on the radii of the decaying meson and are set to @xmath40 gev@xmath41 and @xmath42 gev@xmath41 @xcite ; @xmath43 is the pion momentum in the resonance rest frame at mass @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 describes the angular distribution due to the spin @xmath46 of the resonance .",
    "see details in @xcite .",
    "finally each amplitude is bose symmetrized @xmath47 +   { \\cal a}_n[({\\bf 13}){\\bf 2}]$ ] .    using this model ( model a )",
    ", we find contributions from the following channels : the non - resonant , responsible for more than 90% of the decay rate , followed by @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the decay fractions and relative phases are shown in table  [ tablekappa ] .",
    "these values are in accordance with previous results from e691 @xcite and e687 @xcite .",
    "we thus confirm a high non - resonant contribution according to this model , which is totally unusual in @xmath8 decays .",
    "besides , there is an important destructive interference pattern , since all fractions add up to 140 % .    to evaluate the fit quality of model a , we compute a two - dimensional @xmath52 in the dalitz plot , from the difference in densities for the model ( from a fast - mc algorithm ) and the data .",
    "we obtain @xmath53 ( @xmath54 being the number of degrees of freedom ) , with a corresponding confidence level ( cl ) of @xmath55 . in figure  [ proj_kpipi](a )",
    "we show the @xmath11 low and high squared - mass projections for data ( error bars ) and model ( solid line ) .",
    "the discrepancies are evident at the very low - mass region for @xmath56 and near 2.5 ( gev / c@xmath13)@xmath13 for @xmath57 .",
    "these regions of disagreement are the same observed previously by e687 @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that a model with the known @xmath11 resonances , plus a non - resonant amplitude , is not able to describe the dalitz plot satisfactorily .    a similar pattern  bad fit quality with large nr fraction  is found in the analysis of the decay 3pi when allowing only the established @xmath20 resonances @xcite .",
    "there we find that the inclusion of an extra scalar resonance improves the fit substantially , giving strong evidence for the @xmath21 .",
    "see the section on 3pi below .",
    "thus , we are lead to try an extra scalar resonance in our fit model here . the possible existence of a light and broad @xmath11 scalar state has been suggested by many authors @xcite , some of them believing it would be a member of a light scalar nonet @xcite ; however , its existence has been the subject of some controversy also@xcite .",
    "a second fit model , model b , is constructed by the inclusion of an extra scalar state , with unconstrained mass and width . for consistency ,",
    "the mass and width of the other scalar state , the @xmath58 , are also free parameters of the fit .",
    "we adopt a better description for these scalar states by introducing gaussian - type form - factors @xcite to take into account the finite size of the decaying mesons .",
    "two extra floating parameters are the meson radii @xmath59 and @xmath60 introduced above .    using this model",
    ", we obtain the values of @xmath12 mev / c@xmath13 for the mass and @xmath14 mev / c@xmath13 for the width of the new scalar state ( first error statistical , second error systematic ) , referred to here as the @xmath3 .",
    "the values of mass and width obtained for the @xmath58 are respectively @xmath15 mev / c@xmath13 and @xmath16 mev / c@xmath13 , appearing heavier and narrower than presented by the pdg @xcite .",
    "the decay fractions and relative phases for model b , with systematic errors , are given in table  [ tablekappa ] .",
    "compared to the results of model a ( without @xmath3 ) , the non - resonant mode drops from over 90% to 13% .",
    "the @xmath61 state is now the dominant channel with about 50% .",
    "the meson radii @xmath59 and @xmath60 are found to be respectively @xmath62 gev@xmath41 and @xmath63 gev@xmath41 , in complete agreement with previous estimates @xcite .",
    ".results without @xmath3 ( model a ) and with @xmath3 ( model b ) .",
    "_ preliminary_. [ tablekappa ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ( -300,100)(a)(-70,100)(b )",
    "from the data of the fermilab e791 experiment , we studied the dalitz plots of the decays @xmath0 , 3pi and @xmath64 . in these three final states ,",
    "the scalar intermediate resonances were found to give the main contribution to the decay rates .",
    "we obtained strong evidence for the existence of the @xmath6 and @xmath3 scalar mesons , measuring their masses and widths .",
    "we also obtained new measurements for masses and widths of the other scalars studied , @xmath18 , @xmath65 and @xmath58 .",
