    "it is common knowledge that the kramers - kronig relations connect real and imaginary parts of an analytic function describing some causal physical process . in statistical physics and electrodynamics any material susceptibility satisfies the kramers - kronig relations @xcite .",
    "specifically , they are used to calculate the real part of the dielectric permittivity , @xmath0 , along the real frequency axis and the dielectric permittivity , @xmath1 , along the imaginary frequency axis @xcite . both are expressed through the imaginary part of the permittivity , @xmath2 , at all real frequencies .    in the last few years",
    "the kramers - kronig relations have been repeatedly used to calculate the thermal casimir force in the framework of the lifshitz theory ( see , e.g. , reviews @xcite and recent proceedings @xcite ) .",
    "the casimir force @xcite acts between neutral material bodies and originates from the zero - point oscillations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the lifshitz theory allows one to express the casimir force at a temperature @xmath3 in terms of @xmath1 of the body materials at discrete matsubara frequencies @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath6 .",
    "the tabulated optical data for the complex index of refraction and hence for @xmath2 are , however , available only in some restricted frequency regions @xcite .",
    "therefore the direct calculation of @xmath1 using the kramers - kronig relations is not possible and different approaches to find @xmath1 have been proposed .    in the first approach @xcite the quantity @xmath2 obtained from the tabulated optical data",
    "is extrapolated using the imaginary part of the drude dielectric function to all lower frequencies including zero frequency .",
    "then @xmath7 at all @xmath8 is found from the kramers - kronig relations and is substituted into the lifshitz formula at nonzero temperature . from the theoretical point of view",
    "this approach may seem straightforward , but it leads to a violation of the nernst heat theorem for perfect crystal lattices with no impurities @xcite and to contradiction with the experiment measuring the casimir force at separations from 160 to 750 nm @xcite .",
    "the second approach @xcite is based on the concept of the leontovich surface impedance @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to practically the same contributions to the casimir force , as the first approach , at all matsubara frequencies with @xmath9 .",
    "the contribution of the zero - frequency term is , however , different and fixed by the impedance used . as a consequence",
    "the second approach is not applicable at separations below the plasma wavelength ( equal to 137 nm for au ) where the leontovich impedance boundary condition becomes invalid .",
    "the third approach @xcite does not use the tabulated optical data but employs the dielectric permittivity of the free electron plasma model at all frequencies .",
    "both the second and the third approaches are in agreement with thermodynamics .",
    "they are also consistent with the experiment @xcite performed at separations above the plasma wavelength . however ,",
    "both the second and third approaches can not be applied in the experiment @xcite where measurements start at short separations of 60 nm .",
    "this experiment although performed at @xmath10k was found to be consistent with the lifshitz theory at zero temperature .",
    "( the comparative analysis of all approaches is contained in [ 1820 ] . ) note that the third , plasma model approach , may seem to be in disagreement with the kramers - kronig relations because the dielectric permittivity of the plasma model is entirely real . in this connection",
    "the plasma model approach has been criticized @xcite for the complete neglect of dissipation .",
    "thus at the moment none of the theoretical approaches to the thermal casimir force is consistent with all the available experimental information .    in the present paper",
    "we derive the generalized kramers - kronig relations for the permittivities of the free electron plasma and a plasma - like model which incorporates dissipation due to interband transitions .",
    "we demonstrate that the permittivity of the plasma model ( as any function analytic in the upper half - plane ) satisfies the kramers - kronig relations if the contribution from the pole of the second order at zero frequency is correctly taken into account .",
    "then we compare theoretical computations of the thermal casimir force using the free - electron plasma model and the generalized plasma model incorporating interband transitions with the zero - temperature casimir force calculated using the tabulated optical data .",
    "we demonstrate that the theoretical results using the generalized plasma model are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "thus currently it is the only model for the thermal casimir force which is consistent with all measurements performed to date .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of different types of dissipation processes and their role in the theoretical description of the casimir force .",
    "we consider the generalized plasma - like dielectric permittivity of the form @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the plasma frequency and the oscillator term @xmath13 takes into account the interband transitions of core electrons . here",
    "@xmath14 are the resonant frequencies of the core electrons , @xmath15 are the respective relaxation frequencies , @xmath16 are the oscillator strengths , and @xmath17 is the number of oscillators . the dielectric permittivity ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) was used in sec .",

    "this contribution to @xmath19 is entirely real and does not include dissipation .",
    "it must be emphasized that the oscillator term ( [ eq2 ] ) does not include the oscillator with zero resonant frequency @xmath20 .",
    "thus it does not describe conduction electrons but only the core electrons .",
    "if the core electrons were excluded from our consideration then @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the dielectric permittivity ( [ eq1 ] ) leads to the usual plasma model .",
    "note that for the purpose of the computations below we follow the notations from @xcite ( level 2,d ) for the parameters of the interband oscillators .",
    "because of this we have replaced the relaxation parameter @xmath23 in @xcite for @xmath15 and the oscillator strengths @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of molecules per unit volume , as in @xcite , for @xmath16 . here",
    "we also use @xmath26 in place of @xmath27 @xcite . equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) incorporate dissipation due to interband transitions but do not include processes of electron scattering on phonons , impurities , grain boundaries , surfaces and other electrons . below",
