    "in the theory of the finite fermi systems @xcite it was shown that the giant resonances in nuclei can be considered as the zero - sound excitations which exhaust the large part of the energy - weighted sum rules @xcite .",
    "the same approach is used in the random phase approximation @xcite , in the gas - liquid model @xcite . in this paper",
    "the attempt is made to obtain the information about the giant resonances in nuclei on basis of the solutions of the dispersion equation for the zero - sound excitations in the nuclear matter .",
    "we consider the zero - sound dispersion equation in the symmetric nuclear matter @xmath7 here @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the state density of two sorts of nucleon on the fermi - surface , @xmath10 is the fermi momentum .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is the constant of the landau - migdal effective quasiparticle - quasihole interaction @xcite .",
    "@xmath12    here @xmath13 , @xmath14 are pauli matrices in the spin and isospin space .",
    "the polarization operator @xmath1 is the integral over a nucleon particle - hole loop . here",
    "the simple model of the interaction @xmath15 is used when the interaction is determined by the set of constants . in such model the equation ( [ 1 ] ) is true for all channels of the interaction : scalar ( @xmath11 ) , isospin ( @xmath16 ) , spin ( @xmath17 ) and spin - isospin ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "but the values of @xmath19 are different @xcite .",
    "for example , the constant , responsible for the monopole isoscalar excitations is very small in the nuclear matter .",
    "the polarization operator is taken in a usual way : @xmath20 functions @xmath21 are the migdal s function @xcite @xmath22 , \\ ] ] here @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the equation ( [ 1 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath25    the method of calculation of ( [ 1 ] ) is presented in @xcite .",
    "the polarization operator @xmath1 ( [ 3],[4 ] ) has two overlapping cuts on the real axis of the complex @xmath26-plane .",
    "these are the logarithmic cuts of the functions @xmath21 and @xmath27 .",
    "the physical sense of the cut is the appearance of the real @xmath28-pair at the definite values of @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath29 , @xmath2 in the particle - hole loop in @xmath1 . for not too large wave vectors @xmath2",
    "the collective excitations have the frequencies which are larger than the @xmath28-pair ones .",
    "it means that @xmath0 lies on the real axis of the complex @xmath26-plane more to the right than the cut . with increasing @xmath2 , the cut ( @xmath28 mode ) overlaps with the solution @xmath0 ( collective mode ) .",
    "the solutions @xmath0 become complex and go through the cut to the nearest unphysical sheet of the riemann surface of the logarithm in ( [ 4 ] ) . the physical nature of the imaginary part of @xmath0 is determined by the structure of the cut , i.e. the excitation of the real @xmath28-pair with the further escape of a particle .",
    "so we accept that @xmath5 corresponds to the escape width of the excitations .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the zero - sound excitations in the matter exhaust the large part of the energy - weighted sum rules .",
    "the giant resonances have the same property by the definition .",
    "besides , the equations of the random phase approximation which are used in calculation of the energies and the width of the giant resonances are similar to equations for the zero - sound in the nuclei @xcite .",
    "therefore it is interesting to see what can we know about the giant resonances in the nuclei if to use @xmath0 obtained in the nuclear matter . to establish such relation",
    "we must know the wave vectors @xmath30 which corresponds to the definite giant resonance in the nucleus with the atomic number @xmath31 .",
    "there are some models which consider the nuclei as a drop of a liquid and calculate the energies , @xmath30 and other parameters of resonances @xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath32 for different @xmath31 and compare the real part @xmath33 with the energies of the giant resonances . to evaluate the escape width we use @xmath34 which corresponds to the half of the escape width .",
    "the branch @xmath32 depends on the nuclear matter parameters : the fermi momentum @xmath10 , the value of the effective isovector coupling constant @xmath16 , the value of the effective mass @xmath29 .",
    "variation of these parameters in the acceptable limits permits us to obtain the reasonable correspondence between the experimental data and @xmath32 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the dispersion law of the zero sound is the linear one and @xmath32 grows with @xmath30 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath32 appears when the overlapping of the collective and the @xmath3 modes starts ( i.e. at a definite @xmath35 ) and then grows by the absolute value with @xmath30 @xcite . in the model",
    "@xcite @xmath30 is inversely proportional to @xmath36 ; @xmath30 ( and , consequently , @xmath4 and @xmath37 ) decrease with @xmath31 .",
    "then the energies and escape widths of the giant resonances obtained on basis of @xmath32 decrease with @xmath31 increasing .",
    "the approach used in this paper is too simple to pretend on the satisfactory description of the giant resonances in nuclei .",
    "but it may be very useful if we need the qualitative dependence of the resonance parameters on such variables as the temperature , the difference of the proton and neutron densities , on the form of the effective interaction , on the additional open @xmath3 channels ( isobar - particle - nucleon - hole channel , for example ) .",
    "the essential problem of this approach is the definition of @xmath30 for different excitations .",
    "the steinwedel - jensen model @xcite defines @xmath30 for the excitations of the different multipolarity .",
    "we follow the paper @xcite for the giant dipole resonances : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , @xmath40  fm . using relation @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "we obtain @xmath41 .",
    "this model @xcite is good enough for the giant dipole resonances but it gives too large @xmath30 for the excitations with other multipolarity .    to define",
    "the escape widths more precisely we can make use of the following consideration .",
    "the linear dispersion law for the zero - sound @xmath42 gives us the coefficient of the proportionality @xmath43 .",
    "this coefficient depends on the parameters of the nuclear matter @xmath44 which were used to calculate @xmath0 .",
    "then , using the phenomenological fit ( [ 17 ] ) @xmath45 , we define @xmath46 for the nucleus @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath33 is equal to @xmath45 by the definition and the escape width is determined through @xmath47 .",
    "the theory of the finite fermi - systems @xcite describes the excitations of the dipole collective states with the help of the residual isospin effective quasiparticle interaction @xmath16 .",
    "the values of @xmath16 are determined from the experimental data and changed from 1.0 to 2.0 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) are shown .",
    "the real parts @xmath4 are placed at the positive frequencies and @xmath5 are shown at the negative frequencies . in fig .",
    "1 the solutions are presented for the different values of the effective constants in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , the nuclear matter densities and effective mass @xmath29 .",
    "main _ set of the nuclear matter parameters is the following : @xmath48  mev , @xmath49 ( @xmath50  mev ) , @xmath11=2 @xcite .",
    "the curve @xmath51 on the fig .",
    "1a , b , c is the same and corresponds to the these parameters .    in the fig .  1a the branches @xmath0 are presented for @xmath11=0.2,1.0,2.0 . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the frequencies of the zero - sound excitations grow with @xmath11 at the fixed @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "our calculations demonstrate and it is seen in fig .",
    "1a that such behavior takes place for the real @xmath0 . in the region of overlapping of the collective and @xmath28 modes the behavior",
    "is changed : increasing of @xmath11 gives the decreasing of @xmath4 and increasing of @xmath5 .    in fig .",
    "1b the branches @xmath0 are shown for different @xmath10 . increasing @xmath10 from 200mev to 300mev results in the growth both @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "1c we demonstrate the branches when @xmath29 is changed from 600mev to 940mev .",
    "increasing of @xmath29 gives decreasing of @xmath4 and increasing of @xmath5 .",
    "thus we have a different dependence on the nuclear matter parameters .",
    "to pass from zero - sound excitations in the nuclear matter to the giant resonances in the nuclei we must know the wave vector , corresponding to the definite excitations in a nucleus @xmath31 .",
    "we use the modification of the model steinwedel - jensen , suggested in @xcite : @xmath52 .",
    "we compare @xmath53 with the phenomenological formula for gdr @xcite :    @xmath54    in fig .",
    "2a the curve @xmath55 is described by ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "the calculation with the main set of parameters results in too high energies ( curve @xmath51 , fig .",
    "2a ) and small width of gdr ( curve @xmath51 , fig .",
    "it is possible to find such parameters of the nuclear matter that the description of the curve @xmath55 in fig .",
    "2a will be satisfactory .",
    "for the heavy nuclei we can choose @xmath56  mev , @xmath11=1.0 and @xmath57 ( the curves @xmath58 in fig .",
    "2a , b ) . for the light nuclei we should suppose rather small density in nuclei @xmath59  mev , @xmath11=1.2 and @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "2a , b , curves @xmath60 ) .    for the nuclei @xmath61 from ( [ 17 ] )",
    "we have @xmath62  mev , the experimental escape width is @xmath63  mev . on the fig .  2 ( the curve @xmath60 )",
    "we obtain @xmath64  mev and @xmath65  mev .",
    "for the nuclei @xmath66 from ( [ 17 ] ) we have @xmath67  mev , the experimental escape width is @xmath68  mev . on the fig .  2 ( the curve @xmath58 )",
    "we obtain @xmath69  mev and @xmath70  mev .",
    "thus , we have obtain a satisfactory description of gdr in the heavy nuclei , but for the light nuclei we should suppose a very low nuclear density .",
    "now we try to describe the escape widths more precisely .",
    "the wave vectors @xmath30 related to the giant dipole resonances in the nuclei are rather small @xmath71 for @xmath72 @xcite . as it is shown in fig .",
    "1 the dependence @xmath42 can be considered as the linear one .",
    "for the set of parameter : @xmath56  mev , @xmath57 , @xmath73 we obtain @xmath74 .",
    "define @xmath30 using eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) as @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath33 is equal to @xmath45 by the definition and the escape width is defined as @xmath75 .",
    "the calculations give @xmath76mev and @xmath77mev .",
    "the escape widths of gdr can be approximated by the formula : @xmath78    we can do an observation about the monopole giant resonances ( gmr ) .",
    "as it was mentioned , eq.([1 ] ) describes the excitations in the different channels and the constant @xmath11 of the effective interaction ( [ 2 ] ) which is responsible of the monopole excitations , is small in the nuclear matter @xmath79 @xcite . in fig .",
    "1a we see that at @xmath80 0.4 the real parts of @xmath0 depends on the @xmath11 weakly , but @xmath37 increase quickly",
    ". then we can conclude that in our simple model the energies of gmr and gdr are close in the heavy nuclei @xcite but the escape widths of gmr are appreciably larger .",
