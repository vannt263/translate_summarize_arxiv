    "metallic two - dimensional electron systems frequently exhibit multiple enhanced fluctuations in the charge , magnetic and pairing channels , which lead to a variety of competing instabilities . in the last decade , nematic order and nematic fluctuations in two - dimensional metals have attracted increasing interest . @xcite in a homogeneous nematic state an orientational symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken , without breaking the translation invariance . a nematic state can be formed by partial melting of stripe order in a doped antiferromagnetic mott insulator.@xcite alternatively , a nematic state can be obtained from a pomeranchuk @xcite instability generated by forward scattering interactions in a normal metal.@xcite on a square lattice , the most natural candidate for a pomeranchuk instability has a @xmath2 symmetry , which breaks the equivalence between @xmath3- and @xmath4-directions .    a direct experimental signature of nematic order is a pronounced in - plane anisotropy in transport or spectroscopic measurements , in the absence of additional bragg peaks indicating a broken translation invariance.@xcite evidence for nematic order with a @xmath2 symmetry has been observed in several strongly interacting electron compounds .",
    "a nematic phase with a sharp phase boundary has been established in a series of experiments on ultrapure @xmath5 crystals in a strong magnetic field.@xcite nematic order has also been observed in the high temperature superconductor @xmath6 in transport experiments @xcite and neutron scattering.@xcite due to the slight orthorhombicity of the @xmath7 planes one can not expect a sharp nematic phase transition in @xmath6 .",
    "however , the strong temperature dependence of the observed in - plane anisotropy indicates that the system develops an intrinsic electronic nematicity , which enhances the in - plane anisotropy imposed by the structure .",
    "@xcite    nematic fluctuations close to a continuous nematic quantum phase transition induce non - fermi liquid behavior with a strongly momentum dependent decay rate of electronic excitations .",
    "@xcite mean - field theories for nematic transitions driven by forward scattering interactions in two dimensions indicate that the transition is typically first order at low temperatures , @xcite such that a quantum critical point remains elusive .",
    "however , order parameter fluctuations can change the order of the transition , in favor of a continuous transition even at zero temperature.@xcite    so far , only homogeneous nematic states have been considered .",
    "however , metlitski and sachdev @xcite recently found a tendency toward formation of a _ modulated _ nematic state in a two - dimensional metal with strong antiferromagnetic spin - density wave fluctuations . in that state",
    "the nematic order oscillates spatially across the crystal , with a small and generally incommensurate wave vector that points along the brillouin zone diagonal and increases in length with the distance of the fermi surface from the van hove points .",
    "the modulated nematic order occurs as a secondary instability generated by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , and is related by an emergent pseudospin symmetry to the familiar @xmath0-wave pairing instability.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate the possibility of a modulated nematic state from a different starting point .",
    "we consider a model of tight - binding electrons on a square lattice with an interaction that has an attractive @xmath0-wave component for forward scattering in the charge channel . within a random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    ", we analyze at which wave vector the modulated nematic fluctuations are maximal . for electron densities above van hove filling we find the same diagonal wave vector as metlitski and sachdev in their spin - density wave model.@xcite below van hove filling a modulation parallel to the @xmath3- or @xmath4-axis can be favored .    in realistic models",
    "nematic fluctuations compete with other potential instabilities such as magnetism and superconductivity . here",
    "we do not address this competition .",
    "our model interaction is restricted to a specific @xmath0-wave charge channel .",
    "the competition of modulated nematic fluctuations with antiferromagnetism , superconductivity and charge density wave order in the two - dimensional ( extended ) hubbard model has been the subject of a recent renormalization group analysis.@xcite    the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we define our model and introduce the @xmath0-wave charge susceptibility . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the momentum dependence of the static @xmath0-wave charge susceptibility .",
    "we identify the peaks which determine the wave vector of the leading instability in the ground state , and we compute the singular momentum dependence around the peaks .",
    "we also determine the shift of the peaks at low finite temperature .",
    "we finally conclude in sec .  iv .",
    "we consider a one - band model of electrons on a square lattice with a dispersion @xmath8 and an interaction of the form @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of lattice sites , and @xmath11 is a @xmath0-wave density fluctuation operator ; @xmath12 is a form factor with @xmath2 symmetry such as @xmath13 .",
    "the coupling function @xmath14 is negative and may depend on the momentum transfer @xmath15 .",

    "hence , for @xmath21 , the operator @xmath22 differs significantly from the socalled @xmath0-density wave order parameter @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite    for the kinetic energy we use a tight - binding dispersion of the form @xmath24 where @xmath17 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the hopping amplitudes between nearest , next - to - nearest , and third - nearest neighbors on the square lattice , respectively .",
    "we assume @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 as is adequate for cuprate superconductors .",
    "the dispersion has saddle points at @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 . for @xmath33",
    "the saddle points are shifted to @xmath34 and @xmath35 . a special situation ( van hove filling )",
    "arises when the fermi surface touches the saddle points , so that the density of states diverges logarithmically at the fermi level .",
    "the chemical potential corresponding to van hove filling is given by @xmath36 the amount of @xmath0-wave charge fluctuations can be quantified by the dynamical @xmath0-wave charge ( density ) susceptibility @xcite @xmath37 \\ket \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the time dependent operator corresponding to @xmath22 in the heisenberg picture .",
    "within rpa , the @xmath0-wave charge susceptibility in the model defined above is given by @xmath39 with the bare @xmath0-wave polarization function ( particle - hole bubble ) @xmath40 here and in the following @xmath41 is the fermi function and @xmath42 .",
    "the factor 2 in eq .",
    "( [ rpa ] ) is due to the spin sum .",
    "an instability toward an ordered state with an order parameter @xmath43 is signalled by a divergence of the static susceptibility @xmath44 for a certain wave vector @xmath45 . within rpa",
    "the instability is reached once @xmath46 while @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath49 the ordered state is a homogeneous nematic with unbroken translation invariance .",
    "the case @xmath50 leads to a modulated nematic state with a modulation vector @xmath45 . in previous studies of the above model",
    "it was always assumed that the coupling function @xmath14 is sufficiently strongly peaked at @xmath51 such that the leading instability is at @xmath49 . in the present paper",
    "we consider the case where @xmath14 exhibits no or only a weak dependence on @xmath15 in some region around @xmath51 .",
    "the leading instability in the @xmath0-wave charge channel then occurs at wave vectors at which @xmath52 has a peak . in the following we therefore study the structure of the @xmath0-wave particle - hole bubble , paying particular attention to its extrema",
    "in this section we analyze the momentum dependence of the @xmath0-wave particle - hole bubble @xmath53 at zero frequency .",
    "we will also consider the usual ( @xmath54-wave ) particle - hole bubble @xmath55 for comparison .",
    "the latter is given by eq .",
    "( [ pi_d^0 ] ) without the @xmath0-wave form factor .",
    "the structure depends significantly on the electron density which is determined by the chemical potential .",
    "there are three qualitatively different cases : below , at , and above van hove filling .",
    "we will first analyze @xmath52 in the ground state , and treat finite temperatures subsequently .      in fig .  1 we show @xmath52 in the ground state as a function of @xmath15 , for hopping parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , with three different choices for the electron density below , at , and above van hove filling , corresponding to @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "in all cases there are enhanced ( negative ) values along the lines in the brillouin zone given by the condition    -wave particle - hole bubble @xmath52 as a function of @xmath15 at temperature zero for an electron density below ( a ) , at ( b ) , and above ( c ) van hove filling .",
    "the plots on the right are 3d and sign - reversed versions of the color - coded planar intensity plots on the left . in the 3d plot at van hove filling , the divergence at the origin has been cut off .",
    "the dashed lines drawn in the planar plots are defined by the condition @xmath62.,width=307 ]    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "geometrically these lines can be constructed by expanding the fermi surface by a factor two and then backfolding pieces outside the first brillouin zone into the first zone , as illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "the momentum transfers @xmath15 satisfying the condition ( [ lines ] ) are special in that they connect fermi points with parallel tangents .",
    "( [ lines ] ) is the lattice generalization of the condition @xmath65 in a continuum system with a circular fermi surface . with this in mind",
    ", one may call such momentum transfers _ @xmath66-momenta _ on the lattice , too , although the fermi momenta in a lattice system do not have a common modulus @xmath67.@xcite in the following we will refer to the lines defined by eq .",

    "3 we show the @xmath54-wave particle - hole bubble @xmath68 for comparison . there is again some structure tracing the lines given by @xmath69 .",
    "however , the strongest weight now lies in a region near @xmath70 in the brillouin zone , which is generated by particle - hole excitations connecting the saddle point regions near @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the @xmath0-wave bubble",
    "these contributions are suppressed by the @xmath0-wave form factor , since @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "note that this suppression hinges upon the symmetric choice of the momentum in @xmath73 at the center of the fermionic momenta @xmath74 . to obtain the polarization bubble describing @xmath0-density wave fluctuations",
    "as defined by chakravarty et al.@xcite one would have to replace @xmath75 by @xmath76 and @xmath77 by @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ pi_d^0 ] ) . for @xmath21 one then picks up large contributions from the saddle point region .",
    "incommensurate charge density waves with conventional @xmath54-wave symmetry have also been discussed for two - dimensional electron systems , especially in the context of cuprate superconductors.@xcite in that scenario , the incommensurate modulation vector is however determined by a competition between coulomb energy and phase separation tendencies , not by peaks in the polarization function @xmath68 .",
    "peaks in @xmath68 at small incommensurate wave vectors occurring for large doping ( far from half - filling ) can be associated with modulated _ ferromagnetic _ fluctuations , for example , in a two - dimensional hubbard model . @xcite    at van hove filling , the @xmath0-wave particle - hole bubble is strongly peaked at @xmath51 , which is a crossing point of eight lines satisfying @xmath62 .",

    "( [ lines ] ) are closest to the origin , that is , on the @xmath79- and @xmath80-axes .",
    "the leading instability is thus a modulated nematic with a small modulation vector along one of the crystal axes , or a superposition of such modulations .",
    "let us denote the distance of the points of highest weight from the origin by @xmath81 .",
    "solving @xmath62 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , one obtains @xmath84 further away from van hove filling , the global maxima of @xmath85 can be situated at inflection points of the @xmath66-lines , which are inherited from inflection points of the fermi surface .",
    "explicit expressions for these points are rather lengthy so that we refrain from reporting them .",
    "they are not linked to any symmetry axis of the lattice .    above van hove filling , the distance of the lines eq .",

    "are not the global extrema . above van hove filling , the lines eq .",
    "( [ lines ] ) intersect on the diagonals in the brillouin zone , and the heighest weight is reached at these intersection points .",
    "the leading instability is thus a modulated nematic with a diagonal modulation vector @xmath88 , or a superposition of such modulations . solving @xmath62 for @xmath89 and @xmath83 or @xmath90 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath91 close to van hove filling , @xmath92 is small .",
    "note that @xmath92 is defined only for @xmath93 . for @xmath94 ,",
    "no intersection points exist .    , the grey dotted lines represent momenta @xmath95 .",
    "the momentum represented by the long dashed red line can be reduced to one of the short incommensurate momenta by adding a reciprocal lattice vector.,width=240 ]    the wave vector @xmath96 connects antiferromagnetic _ hot spots _ on the fermi surface ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "this is because these hot spots lie on the magnetic brillouin zone boundary and have parallel fermi surface tangents , and are therefore connected by a diagonal `` @xmath66-vector '' .",
    "the length of @xmath97 is thus twice the distance between the hot spots and the nearest @xmath98-point @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "an instability toward a modulated nematic state with the same modulation vector @xmath97 has been obtained in a recent study of secondary instabilities generated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations.@xcite in that analysis , @xmath97 arises naturally as a vector connecting hot spots since these are the points where ( commensurate ) antiferromagnetic fluctuations couple most strongly to electronic excitations at the fermi surface .",
    "it is remarkable that the same modulation vector emerges as a peak in the @xmath0-wave particle - hole bubble , where it is selected by the fermi surface geometry without any relation to antiferromagnetism .",
    "away from van hove filling , there is a region around @xmath51 where @xmath52 is relatively flat and isotropic ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this region is clearly limited by the @xmath66-lines @xmath62 . for @xmath99",
    "one may expand around @xmath1 .",
    "the leading terms are @xcite @xmath100 the first coefficient is given by a weighted density of states at the fermi level , @xmath101 with a minus sign , so that @xmath102 is always negative .",
    "the second coefficient can be written in the form @xcite @xmath103 here @xmath104 with @xmath105 , and @xmath106 with @xmath107 , and the primes denote derivatives . near van hove filling , the coefficient @xmath108 is dominated by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , since @xmath109 diverges for @xmath110 , while @xmath111 remains finite .",
    "the sign of @xmath108 is typically positive for @xmath112 , and negative for @xmath113 .    hence , away from van hove filling , the interaction term @xmath16 from eq .",
    "( [ h_i ] ) generates a homogeneous nematic instability only if @xmath14 decays sufficiently rapidly at finite @xmath15 .",
    "that is , below van hove filling , @xmath114 with @xmath115 has to be smaller than @xmath116 . furthermore , above van hove filling , @xmath117 with @xmath96 needs to be smaller than @xmath116 , and the curvature of @xmath14 around the origin has to compensate for the negative curvature of @xmath52 .",
    "the rpa analysis therefore indicates that an instability toward a modulated nematic state is more natural .",
    "on the other hand , fluctuations beyond rpa may smear out the peaks resulting from the fermi surface geometry , which could favor a homogeneous nematic state over a modulated one . in principle",
    ", such fluctuations may also wipe out a nematic instability completely.@xcite      the maxima of @xmath85 lie on ridges following the @xmath66-lines given by @xmath118 in the brillouin zone .",
    "the height of the ridges evolves regularly along these lines , with few exceptions .",
    "the shape of the ridge determined by the @xmath15-dependence of @xmath52 perpendicular to the lines is generically singular . to discuss the form of this singularity",
    ", we introduce a coordinate @xmath119 describing the oriented distance from the closest @xmath66-line , see fig .  5 .",
    "we denote points on the @xmath66-line by @xmath120 , and the radius of curvature at @xmath120 by @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the electron velocity at the corresponding point @xmath123 on the fermi surface ( the radius of curvature of the fermi surface at @xmath123 is @xmath124 ) .",

    "altshuler et al.@xcite also specified the momentum dependence for small tangential shifts , in analogy to the isotropic case .",
    "that dependence , however , is generally modified by a non - universal variation of the bubble along the ridge .    at points of zero curvature , in particular inflection points , @xmath134 diverges and the expression ( [ near2k_f ] ) is not applicable . for @xmath135",
    "such points exist typically below van hove filling , and they can host the global extrema of @xmath52 . above van hove filling the global extrema",

    "<S> to assess the strength of nematic fluctuations with a finite wave vector in a two - dimensional metal , we compute the static @xmath0-wave polarization function for tight - binding electrons on a square lattice . at van hove filling and zero temperature the function diverges logarithmically at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> away from van hove filling the ground state polarization function exhibits finite peaks at finite wave vectors . </S>",
    "<S> a nematic instability driven by a sufficiently strong attraction in the @xmath0-wave charge channel thus leads naturally to a spatially modulated nematic state , with a modulation vector that increases in length with the distance from van hove filling . above van hove filling , for a fermi surface crossing the magnetic brillouin zone boundary , the modulation vector connects antiferromagnetic hot spots with collinear fermi velocities . </S>"
