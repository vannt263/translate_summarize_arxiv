    "there is also evidence that spiral galaxies are surrounded by a large amount of non - luminous mass of unknown nature .",
    "these two facts suggest that baryonic dark matter is a possible candidate for halo dark matter .",

    "reveal the presence of _ some _ baryonic matter in the galactic halo , although the inferred optical depth shows that this dark baryonic matter probably does not provides _ all _ the sought missing mass . on the other hand ,",
    "microlensing experiments towards the central regions of the galaxy yield a mass density of unseen star - like objects about three times larger than the value expected from standard disk+bulge models ( udalski et al .",
    "1994 ; alcock et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "these two results from microlensing experiments - the lack of events in the halo and the excess of events in the bulge - lead to the tempting conclusion that more ( resp .",
    "less ) galactic dark matter than expected previously resides in the disk ( resp .",
    "the halo ) . on the other hand , severe constraints on the amount of dark matter in the disk and in the halo arise from the observed large - scale kinematic properties , i.e. the rotation curve of the galaxy at distances larger than the observed luminous distribution , as well as from the small - scale dynamical properties , i.e. the stellar velocity dispersion in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this latter information is derived from the measurement of the vertical acceleration due to the galactic potential near the sun , which yields the determination of the local dynamic surface density .",
    "finally , star counts have now been obtained at very faint magnitudes , either from the hst or from ground - based deep - magnitude surveys , and provide stringent constraints on different parameters entering galactic modeling such as scale lengths , scale heights , and more indirectly stellar mass functions .",
    "these two latter type of constraints , galactic dynamics and star counts , have usually suggested that most of the galactic missing mass resides in the outer so - called dark halo .",
    "there is then an apparent conflict between the afore - mentioned microlensing results and standard astronomical observations .",
    "this paradigm stresses the need to reconsider the standard model of the galaxy , where all dark matter resides in the halo , and to derive a galactic mass - model consistent with the three types of observational constraints , kinematics , star counts and microlensing .",

    "we will discuss in detail the two possibilities of an essentially non - baryonic and a dominantly baryonic mass model for the galaxy ( mra , chabrier & schaeffer , 1997 ) .",
    "in this section we examine the most recent observational determinations of the kinematic properties of the galaxy . we first consider the asymptotic circular velocity , in the milky way and in other spiral galaxies , and then the velocity distribution in our galaxy up to 60 kpc .",
    "different determinations of the total _ mass _ of the galaxy , converted into equivalent circular rotation velocities @xmath6 , are also examined . in the second part of this section , we focus on the determination of the local surface density , inferred from the measurement of the gravitational acceleration of the galactic potential near the galactic mid - plane . from all these observations",
    ", we derive the most likely values for the galactic mass , rotation velocity , and amount of dark matter near the sun , to be reproduced by the final galactic model .",
    "the most recent determinations of the circular velocity as a function of the galactic radius have been reviewed by fich and tremaine ( 1991 ) .",
    "their compilation of the measurements of the outer rotation curve from co , hi and hii observations yields the accurate determination of a velocity of about 220 @xmath7 , constant within @xmath810% up to 14 kpc , with extremely small error bars ( a few % ) . at larger distance there is a hint for a small increase of the rotation curve , but the uncertainty in the data does not allow any robust conclusion . in any case , there is no sign for a significant decrease of the velocity up to about 20 kpc .",
    "more recent observations of neutral hydrogen out to 2.5 @xmath9 , where @xmath10 kpc is the galactocentric position of the sun , yield a slightly lower value @xmath11 ( merrifield , 1992 ) . on the other hand , schechter",

    "this will decrease the afore - mentioned stellar value .",
    "the determination of the rotation curves of external galaxies ( casertano and van albada 1990 ) characterizes what these authors call `` bright galaxies '' , with circular velocities bracketted between 180 and 260 @xmath7 .",
    "these rotation curves show occasionally a slight drop beyond 20 kpc , which for all of them remains within less than 20% at 35 or 40 kpc , almost within the error bars .",
    "the rotation curves are thus flat within the error bar determination ( @xmath13 ) up to the furthest distance at which hydrogen is detectable , i.e more than twice the radius of the visible stellar component .",
    "although no rotation velocity measurements exist for our galaxy beyond 19 kpc , fich and tremaine ( 1991 ) argue that , by comparison with other galaxies , our rotation curve should extend similarly up to at least 35 kpc .    note that the galactic rotation is well confined to the disk plane . at 1 kpc above the disk ,",
    "metal - rich stars show similar rotation velocities and are considered as belonging to the ( thick ) disk population .",
    "most of the metal - depleted stars ( @xmath14 < -1.5 $ ] ) , which probe essentially the halo population , rotate only with @xmath15 assuming a rotation velocity 220 @xmath7 for the local standard of rest , arguing for a non - rotating , or slowly rotating halo ( beers and sommer - larsen , 1995 ) .      attempts to determine the gravitational potential of our galaxy at large distances , from the study of the motion of globular clusters , require some modelling of the velocity distribution in the galactic halo , which enters the jeans equation ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the compilation of harris and racine ( 1979 ) led frenk and white ( 1980 ) to use a 66 cluster sample , with various assumptions for the shape of the galactic halo , to determine the mass of the galaxy within 33 kpc .",
    "these clusters show an overall @xmath16 circular rotation ( assuming @xmath17 ) , again advocating for a slow rotation of the halo , but also for important non - circular motion . translating the dynamically measured mass of the halo within a given radius into an effective circular rotation velocity ( @xmath18 ) , their results can be summarized as follows : this velocity always lies within the range @xmath19 , for _ all _ models , at the 90% confidence level . with the additional constraint",
    "that the globular cluster distribution is not more flattened in the outer region than in the inner region , the allowed velocity - range reduces to 200 - 265 @xmath7 .",
    "a second restriction stems from the fact that if the velocity distribution is not isotropic , the radial rms velocity @xmath20 must be larger than the tangential velocity @xmath21 , because of infall towards the centre of the galaxy .",
    "this leads to the final range @xmath22 , the uncertainty being due to systematic errors .",
    "the more distant the constraint , the more relevant it is to determine the dark matter content of the galaxy , but the more uncertain the data . the sample of 17 globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies at galactocentric distances from 20 up to 60 kpc has been analysed by hartwick and sargent ( 1978 ) .",
    "they determine the mass within 60 kpc , under the two opposite extreme assumptions of purely radial or purely isotropic velocity distributions , respectively . translated into a circular velocity , this leads respectively to @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "caldwell and ostriker ( 1981 ) used the more realistic geometrical mean of the two values @xmath25 .",
    "the latter finally has been scaled by bahcall et al ( 1983 ) to @xmath26 ( to which must be added a @xmath27 uncertainty ) in order to take into account more recent determinations of the local parameters near the sun .",
    "these results are consistent with the more recent and much more precise ( although requiring a modelling of the galaxy profiles ) determination of the mass of the galaxy by kochanek ( 1996 ) , i.e. @xmath28 and @xmath29 at the 90% c.l . , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the mass within 30 and 60 kpc , respectively .",
    "this yields , within the @xmath32 error level we have been using all along the present analysis , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "fich and tremaine ( 1991 ) discuss the implications of the velocities measured for the `` magellanic stream '' , a hydrogen bridge between the magellanic clouds and the galaxy .",
    "a detailed modelling shows that the @xmath35 ( @xmath36 fits better ) halo should extend up to at least 60 kpc .",
    "although such a conclusion is reached by means of several `` natural '' assumptions , and may be questioned , the raw data show gas velocities around 200 @xmath7 .",
    "peebles ( 1989 , 1990 , 1994 ) has examined the total mass of the local group , dominated by andromeda and the milky way . he finds total masses around @xmath37 , suggesting a total mass of about @xmath38 for our galaxy .",
    "moreover , a modelling of all objects at a distance of 4 mpc from the galaxy shows indeed that their velocity distribution is consistent with the mass being attached to the objects .    in summary",
    ", all these studies lead to the conclusion that the milky way has a mass @xmath39 , with a nearly constant rotation velocity @xmath40 , which implies an extension of a galactic dark halo up to at least 100 kpc .",
    "this undetected mass has to be compared with the mass under the form of visible matter , @xmath41 , which sets the scale for the amount of dark matter in the galaxy .",
    "an important constraint on the mass density of the galactic disk in the solar neighbourhood is obtained from the study of the vertical acceleration @xmath42 by means of the local stellar velocity distribution .",

    "( 1987 ) , the surface density of the disk should be reduced to :    _ = 489 ,    in remarkable agreement with the afore - mentioned determination .",
    "a subsequent reanalysis of the kuijken & gilmore ( 1989 ) work gives in fact @xmath63 ( gould , 1990 ) .",

    "( 1992 ) considered their value to disagree significantly with the bienaym et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and kuijken & gilmore ( 1991 ) values is that even with a @xmath32 deviation , the probability for @xmath49 , as given by ( 7 ) , to be less than @xmath66 is only 7% and thus has only one chance in 14 to occur , as stated by these authors .",
    "more optimistically , comforted by the recent flynn & fuchs ( 1994 ) result , we note that all these determinations of @xmath49 should rather be considered as consistent at the @xmath32 level : the uncertainty - weighted average of these four different results ( 5)-(8 ) yields :    _ = 51 6,[siga ]    very close to eq .",
    "( [ sigff ] ) .",
    "we thus may consider the value ( [ sigff ] ) as the most accurate present determination of the solar dynamical density .",
    "the determination of the faint end of the stellar luminosity function ( lf ) , an essential issue to infer the low - mass star and the sub - stellar contributions to the galactic mass budget , has also been subject to strong debate .",
    "wielen et al . (",
    "1983 ) found that , whereas the lf was steadily rising up to @xmath67 , there was a dip beyond this value , leaving very little possibility for a substantial contribution of low - mass stars to the mass of the disk .",
    "subsequent studies ( stobie et al . 1989 , tinney et al . 1992 ) showed that the dip is even more pronounced and starts already at @xmath68 .",
    "gould , bahcall and flynn ( 1996;1997 ) , using hst observations at faint magnitudes , confirm a dropping lf beyond @xmath69 , which corresponds to @xmath70 , although the last bin of the hst lf clearly shows an upturn at @xmath71 .",
    "most of these lfs are based on a photometric determination of the distance , which thus relies on a color - absolute magnitude relationship , up to about a few hundred pc . on the other hand , kroupa ( 1995 )",
    "used a nearby lf , allowing a _ geometric _ determination of the distance .",
    "this yields larger statistical errors , due to the number - limited sample , but better systematic corrections , in particular the ones arising from the unresolved binary companions .",
    "the nearby lf agrees with the photometric one up to @xmath72 but is essentially flat beyond this limit . doing a careful correction for the malmquist bias and for the presence of unresolved binaries , kroupa , tout and gilmore ( 1990 ; 1993 ) and kroupa ( 1995 ) have shown that the properly corrected ground - based photometric lfs are consistent with the local geometric lf .",
    "the issue , however , remains unsettled for the hst lf ( gould et al .",
    ", 1996 ; 1997 ) .",
    "the hst is almost not subject to malmquist bias since its limit magnitude allows the observation of the bottom of the main sequence up to the edge of the disk , but it is subject to uncompleteness due to unresolved systems near the faint end and thus misses essentially all secondaries in late m - dwarf binary systems . ] .",
    "gould et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , however , found that even with this correction , their lf is inconsistent with the nearby lf . near the end of the lf ,",
    "the binary correction is , according to these authors , at most a factor 2 , whereas a factor @xmath73 is required to reconcile the two kinds of lfs .",
    "therefore , unresolved binaries are certainly not the source of the discrepancy between the two lf s . an important quantity to calculate correctly",
    "the correction due to binaries is the rate of binaries and the mass - distribution of the secondaries .",
    "an accurate determination of such quantities require decade - long observations , as conducted for example by duquennoy and mayor ( 1991 ; dm91 ) for nearby f and g stars , with a fairly accurate sensitivity ( @xmath74 ) . note that , altough there are severe natural observational biases toward the detection of near equal - mass systems either from imaging or from spectroscopic surveys , the completeness and the uniformity of the dm91 sample render it almost without any observational selection effect , yielding an almost unbiased mass - ratio determination for f and g star binaries .",
    "the main conclusion of the dm91 study is that a fairly large number ( @xmath75 ) of single stars form a multiple system , and that the shape of the mass - distribution increases toward small mass ratios ( @xmath76 ; see their figure 10 ) .",
    "m - dwarf surveys to address the same issue are still in their infancy and suffer from severe incompleteness and observational biases , so that it will require more years to do a similar analysis for m - dwarf binaries . in any case , as mentioned above , even a full knowledge of the binary correction will not account for all the discrepancy between photometric and geometric lfs . for this reason ,",
    "we have considered in the present paper both ( nearby and hst ) lfs .",
    "we have converted both lfs into _ mass - functions _ ( mf ) , using low - mass star models which accurately reproduce observed mass - m@xmath77 relationships ( chabrier , baraffe & plez , 1996 ) .",

    "the afore - mentioned discrepancy between the two lfs is obvious on the mf , in particular in the domain @xmath78 , with a factor @xmath73 ratio at @xmath79 .    noting that the two lowest bins in the nearby lfs are the least statistically significant ( 2 stars , see kroupa ( 1995 ) ) , mra et al .",

    "we then have fitted the mfs derived from the nearby and the hst lfs with such segmented power - laws .",
    "the characteristics of these mfs are given in table [ tablemf ] and illustrated in figure 1 .",

    "this is consistent with a recent study by mazeh , latham & stefanik ( 1996 ) on the distribution of secondary masses near the substellar limit .",
    "although this study relies on the detection of 3 very - low - mass companions out of 20 f and g dwarfs and subgiants , and thus preclude the precise determination of a substellar mf , these detections suggest that the mass distribution ( the primaries of the sample all have @xmath91 ) rises near the sub - stellar limit .    in any case , whereas the precise determination of the shape of the mf near the bottom of the main sequence , which requires larger statistics , is of prime importance for star - formation theory , the qualitative behaviour , and its overall characterization , is what is most essential to estimate the stellar and sub - stellar mass contributions to the disk mass budget .",

    "these faint magnitude star counts have been shown to be entirely consistent with a thick disk + flattened spheroid population , characterized by their respective i-(v - i ) relationships and mass functions ( [ diskmf ] ) and ( [ sphemf ] ) ( chabrier & mra , 1997 ) .",
    "as shown by these authors , a ( even flattened ) dark halo with the afore - mentioned @xmath133 profile and mf ( 16 ) would predict at least 500 more stars than observed in the hdf field of view .",
    "this shows that , if the dark halo lf is the same as the spheroid one , there is a negligible stellar population in the _ dark halo _ , less than 0.1% of the dynamical mass .    a promising technique to determine more accurately the halo mf comes from the recent surveys of the outer parts of nearby galaxies ( sackett et al .",
    "1994 ; lequeux et al . 1996 ) and from the relation between the slope of the mf and the inferred colors of the halo diffuse emission ( mra , 1997 ) .",

    "although mass segregation effects are expected to be small near the half - mass radius ( see e.g. king et al . , 1995 ; chabrier & mra , 1997 ) , the evolution of the clusters , and their evaporation , might lead to _ initial _ mfs ( imf ) slightly steeper that the afore - mentioned determination .",
    "this would yield even better agreement with the mf ( [ sphemf ] ) and would be consistent with the suggestion that the formation of spheroid field stars and globular clusters has occured in a similar manner and time frame ( fall and rees , 1985 ) .    since the dark - halo stellar population is likely to be insignificant , as mentioned above , eq . ( [ sphemf ] ) gives the total halo ( spheroid + dark halo ) stellar contribution to the dynamically - determined local density @xmath136 , namely @xmath137 .",
    "this puts more stringent limits than the ones obtained from the hst counts alone ( flynn et al . , 1996 ) and shows convincingly that low - mass stars represent a completely negligible fraction of the halo mass .    in summary , the star count analysis of different stellar populations corresponding to different regions of the galaxy , based on accurate evolutionary models for low - mass stars ( baraffe et al . , 1997 ; chabrier et al . , 1996 , 1997 )",
    ", leads to the determination , slope and normalization , of the mf in the disk , the bulge and the spheroid , down to the bottom of the main sequence .",
    "surprinsingly enough , given the different metallicities in these regions and the wide range of stellar masses considered , these mf s are very similar and reasonably well described by power - law mfs @xmath138 with @xmath139 . a flatter mf below @xmath140 for the disk , as sugested by the hst lf , can not be excluded but a more precise determination requires better statistics at the faint end of the lf .",
    "these mfs , consistent with all observed lfs and deep - photometry counts , yield a fairly well determined contribution of _ all main sequence stars _ to the disk and halo _ mass budgets _ , the dark halo stellar contribution to the galactic mass being essentially insignificant .",
    "the determination of the amount of mass under the form of _ sub - stellar _ objects requires the analysis of the microlensing experiments .",
    "within the past few years the microlensing technique has been applied succesfully to the search for dark matter , by inferring the presence of dark objects in the galaxy through their gravitational effect on luminous matter , as proposed initially by paczyski ( 1986 ) .",
    "several groups worldwide have carried out microlensing experiments to determine the amount of dark matter either in the halo of the galaxy ( eros and macho experiments ) or in its central parts ( ogle and macho experiments ) .",
    "we examine below these various experiments and connect the results with the afore - mentioned stellar mfs to determine the contribution of _ sub - stellar objects _ to the galactic mass budget .",
    "numerous events have been detected in the direction of the galactic centre by the ogle ( paczyski et al . , 1996 ) and",
    "macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) surveys .",
    "we focus here on the 40 events obtained from the first - year analysis of the macho collaboration , whose detection efficiency @xmath141 is well determined ( alcock et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the number of events observed by ogle during the first two years is too small and the attempt to use averages would be dominated by small number statistics . at any rate , adding , as an extreme value , the 9 ogle events to the 40 macho ones would not improve significantly the statistics .",
    "the interpretation of the three large - time events ( @xmath142 days ) in the macho survey is still unclear and will be discussed below .",
    "note that there is no event with @xmath143 days .",
    "the number of observed events allows a statistical analysis from their time distribution .",
    "the average effective time @xmath144 can be used to estimate the average lens mass @xmath145 and thus the minimum mass down to which the mass function ( [ diskmf ] ) extends ( see appendix ) :    m = c2 t_e ^-1 ^-1[sqrtm]where the averages are relative to the effective probability distributions @xmath146 for each variable ( see appendix ) . for a simple gaussian velocity distribution , @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "the geometric factor @xmath149 is approximatly 0.39 for a standard ( bahcall & soneira , 1980 + kent , 1992 ) disk+bulge model , and is not very sensitive to the choice of the model .",
    "the mean duration of the 40 events , taking into account the experimental efficiency , is @xmath150 days ( omiting the efficiency leads to @xmath151 days ) .",
    "then a first estimate of the average lens mass is :    ^2 = 0.15which is only a rough estimate , with a velocity dispersion @xmath152 for the bulge .",
    "excluding the three longest events yields @xmath153 .",
    "these estimates introduce the dilemma that will be discussed in detail below : in the first case , microlensing results are compatible with essentially no brown dwarf in the disk / bulge , whereas in the second case , the mass function must extend significantly in the brown dwarf domain .    as mentioned in the appendix a.2 , we stress that @xmath154 has a long power - law tail at large times , since @xmath155 , which yields an unphysical divergence of the moments . therefore , the statistics for the mass of the microlensing events can _ not _ be evaluated correctly from the calculation of the moments , as done sometimes in the literature , but must be evaluated accurately by using the detailed time distribution ( note , however , that the moments of @xmath156 behave correctly ) .",
    "we have calculated the time distribution with a monte - carlo algorithm ( see appendix ) , which determines the number of events :    n_th = e_0^+ ( ) dd d[nth ]    where @xmath157 is the total exposure ( in star - years ) and @xmath158 the experimental efficiency factor ( alcock et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "calculations have been done for a standard disk model ( bahcall & soneira , 1980 ) , and a kent ( 1992 ) model for the bulge , for the two mfs considered in  3.1 .",
    "we have taken velocity dispersions @xmath159 for the bulge and @xmath160 for the disk ( @xmath161 in the radial direction ) , respectively , with a linear interpolation in the intermediate region located between @xmath162 and 3 kpc from the galactic center . as will be shown below",
    ", the uncertainty in the velocity distribution of the stars is the main cause of uncertainty in the present calculations .",
    "our calculations take into account the motion of the sun and of the source star in the determination of the lens velocity as well as the variation of the distance of the _ source _ stars in the disk and the bulge ( see appendix ) .",
    "the distance of the source stars in the bulge is typically 7.5 kpc from the sun , as determined by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) from the observed lf in baade s window .",
    "the time - distribution and number of events obtained from these calculations , for a given model , are compared to the macho observations ( alcock et al .",
    "since the efficiency does not include binary events , we must exclude those events .",
    "however , only a small fraction of the events are expected to be due to both components of a binary system ( 1 out of 45 in the first year , a fraction which seems to be confirmed by the following two years ) . in most cases , the einstein disks of the stars in a multiple system do not overlap , and can in first approximation be treated independently .",
    "the time distribution is therefore barely affected by the binarity .",
    "in any case the number of events has to be corrected only slightly ( typically a few percent ) . in this section",
    ", we are mostly interested in the determination of the mass function in the substellar regime , which is derived only from the time distribution of the observed events .",
    "the consistency between models and observations is analyzed with a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test test for low statistics , and does not depend on any binning of the data . ] .",
    "we will first assume that the mass function in the bulge is the same as in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the mass function is extrapolated in the brown dwarf domain down to a minimum mass , @xmath163 , which is determined when the best agreement between theory and observation is achieved .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ distte1 ] , for the mass functions ( a ) and ( b ) defined in  3.1 , with @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively .",
    "the ks test gives a probability of 85% for mf ( a ) and only 45% for mf",
    "the value @xmath166 for mf ( b ) , and its steeper slope in the brown dwarf domain renders mf ( b ) very similar to a dirac delta - function .",
    "longer timescale events are then more difficult to reproduce . on the other hand , for mf ( a ) , the relative contribution of higher masses is larger , with a better fit of the long timescale observations .",
    "we have also computed the time distribution in case ( b ) with @xmath167 , which correspond to the absence of brown dwarfs in the disk .",
    "this corresponds to the general decreasing behaviour of the hst mf , ignoring the last bin .",
    "the time distribution , also shown in fig .",
    "[ distte1 ] , is incompatible with the observed time distribution , with a ks result of 5% , as already pointed out by han and gould ( 1995 ) .",
    "these results suggest that brown dwarfs are required to explain all the 40 events of the macho first year bulge observations , unless the effect of amplification bias ( alard , 1997 ; han , 1997 ) is important enough to account for the excess of short timescale events .",
    "it has been suggested ( alcock et al 1997 ; han and gould , 1995 ) that the large time events may have another origin than main sequence stars , and might be due to stellar remnants , white dwarfs or neutron stars .",
    "they may be due also to rare statistical fluctuations due to the large tail of the time distribution or , more speculatively , to dwarf nova eruptions ( della valle and livio , 1996 ) . if we exclude the 3 longest events from the present analysis , the agreement between theory and observation improves significantly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ distte2 ] for the same mfs .",
    "this yields minimal masses for the two mass functions @xmath168 in case ( a ) , and @xmath169 in case ( b ) .",
    "the ks significance of the two mfs is 50% in case ( a ) and 40% in case ( b ) .",
    "the minimum masses given above depend on the model used for the calculations , in particular the poorly - determined velocity dispersions in the bulge population ( ibata & gilmore , 1995 ) .",
    "this yields the largest uncertainties in the present results , since @xmath170 .",
    "these mass functions yield a brown dwarf contribution to the surface density in the solar neighborhood , assuming the same scale height as for the m - dwarf population , i.e. @xmath171 pc :    _ bd 33  [ sigbd1 ]    therefore the brown dwarf contribution to the local surface density is about 10% to 20% of the total stellar contribution ( [ sigmastar2 ] ) .",
    "this represents @xmath172% of the observed baryonic mass ( [ sigobs ] ) . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ sigbd1 ] ) , the brown dwarf contribution is also compatible with zero .",
    "the _ total _ surface density in the form of baryonic matter in the disk is thus ( eqs .",
    "( [ sigobs ] ) and ( [ sigbd1 ] ) ) :    _ baryon = 46 6[sigbar ]    consistent with the dynamical determination ( [ sigff ] ) .",
    "there is no need for any additional dark matter .",
    "the contribution of _ stellar and substellar objects _ to the surface density is ( eq.([sigmastar2 ] ) and eq.([sigbd1 ] ) ) :    _ ss = 30 5   pc^-2[sigss ]    this yields an optical depth ( see e.g. kiraga & paczyski , 1994 ) :    @xmath173    i.e. @xmath174 , a factor @xmath8 2 to 3 smaller than the observed value @xmath175 ( alcock et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , although the observed time - distribution of the events is well reproduced by the present model , the optical depth amounts to @xmath176 of the observed value .",
    "this clearly suggests a bulge strongly elongated along the line - of - sight or , similarly , a bar model ( zhao 1994 ) . we have not included a bar - model in our calculations , but from the present analysis , its contribution to the optical depth corresponds to :    _ bar 110 ^ -6 m_bar/(10 ^ 10 ) [ taubar ]    in good agreement with various models ( zhao , spergel & rich , 1995 , 1996 ; han & gould , 1995 ; stanek et al . , 1997 ; bissantz et al . ,",
    "infrared observations from dirbe seem to constrain the mass of the bulge within 2.4 kpc to @xmath177 , although this value is obtained by substracting a model - disk contribution ; a more general constraint concerns the _ bulge_+_disk _ mass @xmath178 ( bissantz et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "note however that the three long - time events contribute about 1/3 to the observed optical depth , so that the discrepancy between the value ( [ taudisk ] ) and the observed one is reduced appreciably if these events are removed , leading to a smaller mass for the bulge .",
    "moreover , as noted recently by han ( 1997 ) and alard ( 1997 ) , the optical depth toward the bulge might be overestimated by as much as a factor 1.7 , because of amplification bias due to pixel lensing .      as mentioned by alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , there are significant uncertainties in the estimated bulge optical depth , because essentially of blending effects .",
    "for this reason , the macho collaboration has conducted a separate analysis of the events whose source is a bulge _ giant _ ( alcock et al . 1997 ) .",
    "although the statistics are significantly diminished ( @xmath179 source giants and 13 events ) , the efficiency and the reliability of the results are improved appreciably .",
    "the corresponding optical depth is also substantially larger , but only at the @xmath180 level , than the value obtained when including the totality of the events , namely @xmath181 .",
    "the mean duration of these events is @xmath182 days , which yields an unrealistic average mass of 0.6 @xmath84 from relation ( [ sqrtm ] ) .",
    "this high value is confirmed by the complete calculation , with a minimum mass @xmath183 .",
    "this minimum mass is the same for both mfs ( a ) and ( b ) because they are identical for @xmath184 .",
    "such a high minimal mass is not allowed in the disk , since many stars with mass @xmath185 are observed in the solar neighborhood .",
    "therefore , either the bulge mass function is different from the disk mf , or the three long time scale events have a different origin ( most likely stellar remnants ) .    without including the three afore - mentioned long - time events , which all correspond to a bulge clump giant source , the mean duration is @xmath186 days , yielding an average mass of 0.15 @xmath84 .",
    "the minimum mass derived with the complete calculations to reproduce the time distribution in that case is @xmath187 in case ( a ) and @xmath188 in case ( b ) .",
    "the ks test gives a result of 70% in both cases .",
    "figure [ figmod ] shows the model distribution compared to observations in case ( a ) .",
    "it is thus possible to explain the observed time distribution with a main sequence stellar population with the mass function ( a ) or ( b ) plus a stellar remnant population .      the ogle collaboration ( pacziski et al .",
    ", 1994 ) and the macho collaboration ( alcock et al . , 1997 ) , have observed the same region , near the baade s window , in the direction of the bulge .",
    "the macho collaboration observed _ six _ events whose source lies on the _ disk _ ms , with a magnitude @xmath189 .",
    "the sources of 3 of these 6 events lie near the very red edge of the ms and could well be bulge blue helium core burning giants .",
    "this could be easily verified from their spectra . however , the remaining 3 sources are likely to be disk ms stars .",
    "these events yield an optical depth @xmath190 , whereas the standard disk model ( with no dark population ) yields @xmath191 and a _ maximal disk _ ( see paper ii ) yields @xmath192 . but the macho efficiency used for the derivation of this optical depth is an average over all source stars .",
    "since we are considering only sources with @xmath193 , the efficiency for these brighter sources must be higher . with an extreme ( unlikely ) 100% efficiency , the optical depth for disk sources is @xmath194 in better agreement with disk models .",
    "we stress that theoretical estimates depend strongly on the disk scale length and scale height .",
    "the average time for the corresponding 3 events is @xmath195 days .",
    "since the source stars are as bright as the bulge clump giants , the blending is expected to be negligible for these events .",
    "the mean duration would correspond to a minimum mass smaller than 0.005 @xmath84 , definitely in the brown dwarf domain .",
    "however , the extrapolation of either mass function ( a ) or ( b ) down to a minimum mass of 0.005 @xmath84 requires a moderate power - law exponent in order not to exceed the local dynamical limit ( @xmath196 if @xmath197 and @xmath198 if @xmath199 for mf ( a ) ) .",
    "moreover , such a low minimum mass overproduces short time scale events for bulge sources , especially when only clump giant sources are considered .",
    "figure [ figmod ] shows the calculated time distribution of the microlensing events obtained with the mf ( a ) with _ two different minimum masses _ for the bulge and the disk , as inferred from  4.1.1 and 4.1.2 . a minimum mass @xmath200 for the _ bulge _ and @xmath201 for the _ disk _ , with both mfs ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the model distributions agree with a 70% ks result with the observed one .",
    "such a disk brown dwarf population corresponds to a local surface density :    _ bd 20 - 30 [ sigbd2 ]    clearly any solution between the above one and the one where @xmath202 everywhere ( cf  [ sourcegeante ] ) , i.e. no brown dwarf , looks acceptable .",
    "the disk contribution to the bulge optical depth in this model is @xmath203 , slightly larger than the optical depth of a standard ( no brown dwarf ) disk ( @xmath204 ) , but still insufficient to explain the observed @xmath205 .",
    "whereas small number statistics and uncertainty in the distance of the sources prevent a reliable determination of the brown dwarf contribution to the disk mass budget in this case , the present analysis corresponds to a brown dwarf and a dynamical density in the disk , from ( [ sigobs ] ) , ( [ sigbd1 ] ) and ( [ sigbd2 ] ) :    _ bd0 - 30 ; _ 40 - 70,[total ]    possibly larger than the value ( [ sigff ] ) determined in  2.1 .",
    "a mass - dependent scale height does not change significantly the brown dwarf contribution , unless their scale height is larger than @xmath206 kpc .",
    "these results leave open the following possibility : * i ) * the mass functions of the disk and the bulge are different , in particular in term of minimum mass , and * ii ) * the dynamical upper limit for @xmath49 ( eq . [ sigff ] ) and the observed density of baryonic matter ( eq . [ sigobs ] ) imply that 20 to 30 @xmath62 of the solar surface density can be in the form of brown dwarfs , in agreement with the microlensing analysis ( eq . [ total ] ) .",
    "note that the possibility for the disk and bulge mass functions to be different has also been suggested by gould et al .",

    "however , although these authors invoke a large population of brown dwarfs in the _ bulge _ , the present analysis suggest that they could as well be located in the _",
    "disk_. a more precise determination of the amount of brown dwarfs in the disk requires microlensing observations optimized for characteristic timescales of a few days , corresponding to a sampling of two observations per day .",
    "we stress the need for such microlensing searches .",
    "the present analysis illustrates the difficulty to reach robust conclusions about the mass under the form of sub - stellar objects in the central regions of the galaxy , and more precisely in the disk and the bulge , from present microlensing experiments .",
    "the situation will certainly be clarified once future projects will be operational , allowing much better statistics in both parts of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , the macho survey has now a total of more than 200 candidate microlensing events , still under analysis , which will improve the present determinations .    the volume density of _ disk _ brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood deduced from the two types of calculations described above , global vs separate disk / bulge analysis , correspond respectively to @xmath207 ( from eq .

    "as will be shown in paper ii , the number of observed events can not be explained by dark objects in the lmc itself . as shown by chabrier & mra ( 1997 ) and graff & freese ( 1996 ) , extrapolation of the mf ( [ sphemf ] ) into the brown dwarf domain",
    "yields a negligible fraction of brown dwarfs in the galactic halo .",
    "a substantial amount of these objects in the halo thus implies a significantly different , much steeper mf beyond the hydrogen - burning limit . in order to estimate the _ maximum contribution _ of halo substellar objects to the microlensing counts",
    ", we consider , as in mra et al ( 1996b ) , a halo mf @xmath219 with @xmath220 , essentially a dirac - peaked mf .",
    "the _ maximum normalization _ of @xmath221 at 0.1 @xmath84 is the observed count of halo subdwarfs in the solar neighborhood , derived in  3.4 .",
    "we thus take as the _ upper limit _ for the dark halo substellar mass function :    \\(m ) = 4.010 ^ -3 ( ) ^-5 ^-1 ^-3[halomf ]    a kolmogorov - smirnov test done on the @xmath222 distribution of the eros + macho halo events shows unambigously that such a mf is not consistent with the observations , whatever the value of @xmath163 .",
    "the optical depth can be reproduced only if @xmath223 , but the time distribution is in severe conflict with the observed one , as shown by a 0.02% ks probability ( @xmath224 days ) .",
    "the expected average mass of microlensing events is related to the characteristic timescale of the event and to the velocity dispersion ( see appendix eqs .",
    "a2 and a15 ) .",
    "the average tangential velocity is proportional to the dispersion of the gaussian velocity distribution @xmath225 ( see appendix ) . assuming a _ maximal _ dark halo @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the local dark matter density ( bahcall 1986 ) , this dispersion corresponds to the asymptotic rotation velocity with the relation @xmath228 , where @xmath229 km.s@xmath230 , as given by the isothermal sphere model ( binney and tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "this yields an average mass , corrected for blending , @xmath231 , as suggested by the macho collaboration ( alcock et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "several observations ( beers & sommer - larsen , 1995 ; dahn et al . , 1995 ;",
    "layden et al . , 1996 ) suggest that the halo population velocity ellipsoid is radially elongated , by a factor @xmath232 .",
    "this yields a projection effect which decreases the velocity dispersion . on the other hand , this dispersion is bound by the velocity of the line - of - sight toward the lmc ( eq . [ vrel ] ) , which is ( after proper calculations ) , @xmath233 .",
    "this corresponds to a minimum mass @xmath234 but to a _",
    "zero _ dispersion velocity , clearly an irrealistic possibility .",
    "when considering such a `` modified '' halo model , with a non - isotropic velocity dispersion tensor at 1@xmath148 of 80 @xmath7 and an important oblateness , the time distribution can be reproduced with @xmath235 , still above the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "however , the number of observed events implies a normalization for the halo mf at 0.1 @xmath84 significantly larger than the maximum value ( [ sphemf ] ) , inferred from observed low - mass stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "these calculations show that , if the results of the recent macho analysis are confirmed , the possibility for halo dark objects to be field brown dwarfs is clearly excluded , even for a mf substantially steeper than the ones in the disk and the spheroid , for any halo model . this analysis , consistent with the macho observations ( alcock et al . , 1996 ) and with star count analysis at faint magnitudes ( chabrier & mra , 1997 ) , and the one conducted in  3.4 and 3.5 , suggest a negligible mass - fraction under the form of field stars and brown dwarfs in the dark halo . different solutions to try to reconcile star counts and microlensing observations in the halo will be considered in paper ii .",
    "in this paper , we have examined in detail all the observational sources that constrain the mass distribution of the galaxy .",
    "this includes dynamical constraints , circular rotation velocity and vertical velocity dispersion in the solar neighborhood , star counts in the disk , bulge and spheroid , and microlensing observations towards the galactic halo and the galactic center .",
    "the star counts yield the derivation of stellar mass functions for the disk , the bulge and the spheroid down to the bottom of the main sequence . a substantial discrepancy , however , remains between the mf inferred from the nearby lf and the one deduced from the hst lf in the range @xmath236 .",
    "although the nearby mf is consistent with a steadilly rising power - law @xmath138 with @xmath237 down to the bottom of the main sequence , the hst mf is essentially flat below 0.6 @xmath84 .",
    "interestingly enough , the significantly rising last bin of the hst mf , indicates an upturn of the mf near the brown dwarf domain , so that both type of mfs , nearby and photometric , suggest the presence of a substantial amount of brown dwarfs in the galactic disk .    we have determined the normalization of these mass functions and shown that the ratio of the halo to disk main sequence stellar density is about @xmath238 near the bottom of the main sequence .",
    "the presence of the spheroid is proven unambigously by the observed star counts of high velocity stars but its contribution to the galactic mass is negligible .",
    "these calculations yield the determination of the contribution of main sequence stars , and thus of _ observed _ baryonic matter , to the disk and halo mass budget .",
    "the detected ( thin+thick ) disk stellar surface density corresponds to @xmath239 , whereas the halo ( spheroid + dark halo ) density corresponds to less than @xmath240 of the dynamically determined dark matter , significantly less than the limit determined by the hst ( flynn et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the contribution of sub - stellar objects to this mass depends on the lower limit down to which the mass functions can be extrapolated .",
    "this limit is fixed by the microlensing observations , in particular by the time distribution of the events .",
    "this combined analysis of star counts for the luminous part of the mass function , which yields the determination of the slope and normalization near the brown dwarf limit , and of microlensing experiments , which determines the minimum mass , yields a _ consistent determination _ of the dark matter under the form of star - like objects , low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , in different parts of the galaxy .",
    "although uncertainties due to either small statistics or ill - constrained velocity dispersion and location of the sources in the bulge prevent for now a precise determination , the derived brown dwarf surface density in the solar neighborhood , for a scale height @xmath241 pc ( gould et al . , 1997 ) , is likely to be in the range @xmath242 so that the total local density in the disk is @xmath243 . as will be shown in paper ii ( mra et al . , 1997 ) , this is in agreement with various observational determinations .",
    "more statistics of microlensing events towards the bulge will allow a separate determination of the brown dwarf contribution in the bulge and in the disk .",
    "an attempt based on the analysis of the events whose source is a clump giant or a disk main sequence star , respectively , yield rather surprising results ( hampered by present observational uncertainties ) : most brown dwarfs would be present in the disk , whereas the bulge would contain almost none of these objects .",
    "this stresses the need for further observations in this region .    for the halo ,",
    "we show that brown dwarfs have a negligible contribution ( @xmath244 ) to the halo mass .",
    "a steep ( @xmath245 ) mass function in the halo seems to be excluded both by the microlensing analysis and by the m - dwarf lf .",
    "therefore , the present analysis excludes main sequence stars and brown dwarfs as a significant contribution to the halo mass budget .",
    "the nature of the dark events observed in the halo remains a puzzle .",
    "halo white dwarfs remain the least unlikely candidates , although this scenario implies severe constraints on the age of the halo and its initial mass function ( chabrier et al . , 1996 ; adams & laughlin , 1996 ) .",
    "more attention will be devoted to this problem in paper ii .    these calculations , which combine observational constraints arising from star counts , microlensing experiments and kinematic properties , yield the consistent determination of the amount of dark matter under the form of stellar and sub - stellar objects in the differents parts of the galaxy .",
    "this yields new insight on the distribution of baryonic dark matter in the galaxy and bears important consequences for the derivation of a consistent galactic mass - model .",
    "this will be examined in the next paper ( mra , chabrier and schaeffer , 1997 , paper ii ) .",
