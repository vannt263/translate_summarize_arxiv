    "in the past few decades , large galaxy redshift surveys have revealed structures on ever - increasing scales .",
    "the largest structures found are superclusters , collections of thousands of galaxies with sizes as large as 100 mpc .",
    "the mere existence of these structures places important constraints on theories of the formation of galaxies and clusters .",
    "the shapley supercluster , the subject of this paper , is one of the most massive concentrations of galaxies in the local universe ( scaramella et al .",
    "1989 ; raychaudhury 1989 ) , so it is also of particular interest to consider its effect on the dynamics of the local group .",
    "the shapley supercluster ( ssc ) is a remarkably rich concentration of galaxies centred around r.a.@xmath14 dec .",
    "@xmath15 which has been investigated by numerous authors since its discovery in 1930 ( see quintana et al .",
    "it consists of many clusters and groups of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath16 .",
    "the ssc lies in the general direction of the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ) , and is located 130  beyond the hydra - centaurus supercluster ( itself @xmath17  away from us ) .",
    "quintana et al .",
    "( 1995 ) estimated that for @xmath18 and @xmath19= 75the gravitational pull of the supercluster may account for up to 25% of the peculiar velocity of the local group required to explain the cmb dipole anisotropy in which case the mass of the supercluster would be dominated by inter - cluster dark matter .",
    "a major study of the ssc was made by bardelli et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 and references therein ) who also studied inter - cluster galaxies in the core region of the supercluster .",
    "they derived a total mean overdensity of the ssc of @xmath20 on a scale of @xmath21 mpc and found that the central part of the supercluster contributes about 26  to the peculiar velocity of the local group .",
    "the early studies of the shapley supercluster were limited ( primarily by observational constraints ) to the various rich abell galaxy clusters in the region , but this might give a very biased view of the overall supercluster as they represent only the most concentrated peaks in the luminous matter distribution .",
    "we have commenced an investigation into the larger scale distributions of galaxies throughout the entire ssc region and close environs using data from wide - field multi - fibre spectrographs such as the flair - ii system on the u.k .",
    "schmidt telescope ( ukst ) of the anglo - australian observatory ( parker & watson , 1995 , parker 1997 ) . with such multiplexed facilities we are able to measure many more galaxy redshifts over large angular extents and obtain a more complete picture of the composition and disposition of galaxies in the entire supercluster .",
    "a preliminary analysis based on 301 new , bright ( @xmath22 ) galaxy redshifts obtained with flair - ii in a 77  deg@xmath23 region of the supercluster has already been published by our group ( drinkwater et al .  1999 , hereafter d99 ) .",
    "the measured galaxies were uniformly distributed over the selected inter - cluster regions , and most ( @xmath24 ) were found to be members of the supercluster .",
    "the d99 sample traced out two previously unknown sheets of galaxies which appeared to link various abell clusters in the supercluster .",
    "we also found that in a 44 deg@xmath23 sub - area of the supercluster _ excluding _ the abell clusters , these sheets alone represent an overdensity of a factor of @xmath25 compared to a uniform galaxy distribution . within the initial survey area of d99",
    "the new galaxies contribute an additional 50% to the known contents of the shapley supercluster in that region , implying a corresponding increase in contribution to the motion of the local group .",
    "a much larger galaxy sample over a similar area of sky was presented by quintana et al.(2000 ) .",
    "they measured nearly 3000 galaxy redshifts in an area of about @xmath26 .",
    "they estimated the upper bound on the mass of the central region and found the overdensity to be substantial , but still only able to contribute to a small fraction ( @xmath27% ) of the observed motion of the local group ( reisenegger et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "in this paper we present radial velocities for an additional 409 bright ( @xmath28 ) galaxies spread over an extended region to the east , west and south of the main ssc concentration .",
    "we analyse a combined magnitude - limited sample from this paper and d99 of 710 galaxies with measured redshifts , of which 464 ( 65 per cent ) are members of the supercluster based on their redshift range ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "they seem to link the two previously identified galaxy sheets found in d99 and also establish a connection with a third feature at @xmath5= 15000near r.a.=  13h .",
    "the new sample also tends to fill a previous gap in the galaxy distribution between the foreground hydra - centaurus region and the ssc .",
    "future study of the ssc will cover even larger regions using data from the flash survey of kaldare et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( also with the ukst / flair - ii system ) and the 6df survey of the southern sky currently in progress ( watson et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the observed galaxy sample and observations are described in section  2 , the results are presented in section  3 and a brief discussion of the significance of these new measurements is given in section  4 . a full and detailed analysis and interpretation of the new redshifts from d99 , this work and a compilation of all literature redshifts in the ssc is the subject of a separate paper ( proust et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "unless otherwise noted in this paper we use a hubble constant of @xmath3 giving a distance of 200 mpc to the main supercluster ( @xmath30 ) so 1 degree subtends a distance of 3.5 mpc .",
    "in 1997 we began a concerted campaign to obtain complete samples of galaxies down to the same magnitude below @xmath31 for constituent clusters and inter - cluster regions of the ssc using the flair - ii system at the ukst . during the period 1997 - 2000 we subsequently observed more than 700 selected galaxies over 7 ukst standard fields in the ssc region , namely in fields 382384 and 443446 .",
    "the main ssc core centred on a3558 at @xmath32 , @xmath3331@xmath34 is in field 444 .",
    "as each selected abell cluster has a projected angular diameter of 2.5 to 3.0 degrees , the wide - field ukst flair - ii system was an ideal facility for this project whilst additionally permitting us to probe the regions between the dominant clusters neglected in previous studies .",
    "these combined fields covered an area of 182  deg@xmath10 which allows us to investigate the outer limits of the ssc out to radii of more than 10  deg ( 35 ) from a3558 .",
    "all target galaxies were originally obtained from the red eso / src sky survey plates of the above fields scanned by the paris observatory mama plate - measuring machine ( guibert & moreau 1991 ; moreau 1992 ) .",
    "the images were classified using standard star / galaxy separation techniques ( e.g. dickey et al .",
    "1987 , heydon - dumbleton et al .",
    "we defined a galaxy sample to a photometric limit of @xmath35 , corresponding ( assuming a mean @xmath36 ) to @xmath37 , the nominal galaxy limiting magnitude of the flair - ii system ( parker & watson 1995 ) .",
    "this corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath38 at the shapley distance of 200 .",
    "this selection gave total galaxy samples of 6001000 per field .",
    "all previously catalogued matches to literature redshifts were then removed from the target samples prior to observation .",
    "table  1 gives the journal of flair - ii observations reported here .",
    "an interim magnetic - button fibre - ferrule system , implemented with the 71-fibre flair - ii plateholder , was commissioned during these observations .",
    "this was as a proof of concept for the recently - commissioned automated robotic fibre positioner that will replace flair - ii at the ukst and known as 6df - for 6-degree field ( e.g. watson et al . 2000 ) .",
    "note that typically 6  fibres were devoted to the blank sky regions to facilitate sky - background subtraction .",
    "an overall redshift success rate of 75% was achieved from the flair - ii data .",
    "_ here we only present the first 10 lines of our 710-line catalogue of all galaxies observed . the complete table is provided in the electronic latex   input file of the paper and as a separate text file . _"
