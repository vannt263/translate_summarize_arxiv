    "in order to determine the g factors of each pa resonance additionally to the @xmath33 component the @xmath761 components were measured .",
    "simplified fits using a loss coefficient with a single gaussian frequency dependence of each zeeman component were used to determine the line centers .",
    "a drift of the initial atom number @xmath77 during the measurement was taken into account by a linear variation of @xmath77 .",
    "the magnetic field was calibrated by measuring the atomic zeeman splitting at a given current through the helmholtz coil and using the atomic g factor @xmath78 @xcite of the @xmath79 state .      for the weakest bound states",
    "@xmath34 we could measure the atomic zeeman splitting within minutes after measuring the molecular zeeman splitting .",
    "several measurements during a day indicate that no resolvable change in the field strength on this time scale occurred .",
    "therefore the uncertainty in the field strength was below 0.1% . for deeper bound molecular states it was not possible to observe the atomic zeeman splitting during the same measurement run .",
    "the field strength was therefore calibrated several times on different days by the atomic zeeman splitting of @xmath80mhz for the same coil current .",
    "the asymmetry of the splitting , i.e. the difference between the @xmath81 and the @xmath82 splitting was up to @xmath83khz , which is in the order of 1% of the total splitting .",
    "possible mechanisms for the asymmetry could be a quadratic molecular zeeman effect , tensor and vector light shifts caused by the dipole trap and @xmath84 dependent light shifts from the pa laser . as the asymmetry did not show a clear systematic behaviour we have used the mean value of the splitting for the determination of the effective g factors and have included the full asymmetry into the uncertainty ."
