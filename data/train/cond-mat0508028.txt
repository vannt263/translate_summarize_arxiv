    "we present a generative model for constructing networks that grow via competition between cycle formation and the addition of new nodes .",
    "the algorithm is intended to model situations such as trading networks , kinship relationships , or business alliances , where networks evolve by either establishing closer connections by adding links to existing nodes or alternatively by adding new nodes . in arranging a marriage , for example , parents may attempt to find a partner within their pre - existing kinship network . for reasons such as alliance building and incest avoidance ,",
    "such a partner should ideally be separated by a given distance in the kinship network @xcite .",
    "such a marriage establishes a direct tie between families , creating new cycles in the kinship network .",
    "alternatively , if they do not find an appropriate partner within the existing network , they may seek a partner completely outside it , thereby adding a new node and expanding it .",
    "another motivating example is trading networks @xcite .",
    "suppose two agents ( nodes ) are linked if they trade directly .",
    "to avoid the markups of middlemen , and for reasons of trust or reliability , an agent may seek new , more distant , trading partners . if such a partner is found within the existing network a direct link is established , creating a cycle . if not , a new partner is found outside the network , a direct link is established , and the network grows . a similar story can be told about strategic alliances of businesses @xcite ; when a business seeks a partner , that partner should not be too similar to businesses with which relationships already exist .",
    "thus the business will first take the path of least effort , and seek an appropriate partner within the existing network of businesses that it knows ; if this is not possible , it may be forced to find a partner outside the existing network .",
    "all of these examples share the common property that they involve a competition between a process for creating new cycles within the existing network and the addition of new nodes to the network .",
    "while there has been an explosion of work on generative models of graphs @xcite , there has been very little work on networks of this type . the only exception that we are aware of involves network models of autocatalytic metabolisms @xcite .",
    "such autocatalytic networks have the property that network growth comes about through the addition of autocatalytic cycles , which can either involve existing chemical species or entirely new chemical species .",
    "previous work has focused on topological graph closure properties @xcite , or the simulation of chemical kinetics @xcite , and was not focused on the statistical properties of the graphs themselves .",
    "we call graphs of the type that we study here _ feedback networks _ because the cycles in the graph represent a potential for feedback processes , such as strengthening the ties of an alliance or chemical feedback that may enhance the concentration corresponding to an existing node @xcite",
    ".    we study the degree distributions of the graphs generated by our algorithm @xcite , and find that they are well - described by distribution functions that have recently been proposed in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , more precisely in nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "such distributions occur in the presence of strong correlations , e.g. phenomena with long - range interactions .",
    "our intuition for why these distributions occur here is that the cycle generation inherently generates long range correlations in the construction of the graph .",
    "the growth model we propose closely mimics the examples given above . for each time step ,",
    "a starting node @xmath1 is randomly selected ( e.g. the person or family looking for a marriage partner ) and a target node @xmath2 ( the marriage partner ) is searched for within the existing network .",
    "node @xmath2 is not known at the outset but is searched for starting at node @xmath1 .",
    "the search proceeds by attempting to move through the existing network for some @xmath3 number of steps without retracing the path .",
    "if the search is successful a new link ( edge ) is drawn from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . if the search is unsuccessful , as explained below , a new node @xmath4 is added to the graph and a link is drawn from @xmath1 to @xmath4",
    ". this process can be repeated for an arbitrary number of steps . in our simulations , we begin with a single isolated node but the initial condition is asymptotically not important .    for each time step",
    "we randomly draw from a scale free distribution the starting node @xmath1 , the distance @xmath3 ( number of steps necessary to locate @xmath2 starting at @xmath1 assuming that such a location does occur ) , and for each node along the search path , the subsequent neighbor from which to continue the search .",
    "while node @xmath2 is nt randomly selected at the outset , it is obviously guaranteed that the shortest path distance from @xmath1 to @xmath2 is at most @xmath3 .",
    "we now describe the model in more detail including the method for generating search paths , and the criterion for a successful search .    *",
    "* _ selection of node @xmath1_*. the probability @xmath5 of selecting a given node from among the @xmath6 nodes of the existing network is proportional to its degree raised to a power @xmath7 .",

    "[ eq2 ] . * * _ generation of search path_*. in the search for node @xmath2 , assume that at a given instant the search is at node @xmath14 , where initially @xmath15 .",
    "a step of the search occurs by randomly choosing a neighbor of @xmath14 , defined as a node @xmath16 with an edge connecting it to @xmath14 .",
    "we do not allow the search to retrace its steps , so nodes @xmath16 that have already been visited are excluded .",
    "furthermore , to make the search more efficient , the probability of choosing node @xmath16 is weighted based on its unused degree @xmath17 , which is defined as the number of neighbors of @xmath16 that have not yet been visited . the probability for selecting a given neighbor @xmath16 is @xmath18 } \\over { \\sum_{m=1}^m { \\big[1+{\\mbox u}(m)^\\gamma\\big ] } } } ,     \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the number of unvisited nearest neighbors of node @xmath14",
    "@xmath20 is called the _ routing parameter_. if there are no unvisited neighbors of @xmath14 the search is terminated , a new node is created , and an edge is drawn between the new node and node @xmath1",
    ". otherwise this process is repeated up to @xmath3 steps , and a new edge is drawn between node @xmath21 and node @xmath1 . in the first case we call this _ node creation _ , and in the second case , _",

    "the sizes of the nodes represent their degrees and in figure [ weight graphs ] the thickness of the edge is proportional to the number of successfully created feedback cycles in which the edge participated ( i.e. the number of times the search traversed this edge ) .",
    "the attachment parameter @xmath7 controls the extent to which the graph tends to form hubs ( highly connected nodes ) . when @xmath28 there is no tendency to form hubs , whereas when @xmath7 is large there tend to be fewer hubs .",
    "as the distance decay parameter @xmath29 increases the network tends to become denser due to the fact that @xmath3 is typically very small .",
    "as @xmath30 increases the search tends to seek out nodes with higher connectivity , there is a higher probability of successful cycle formation , and the resulting graphs tend to be more interconnected and less tree - like .    despite that fact that network formation in our model depends purely on local information , i.e. each step only depends on information about nodes and their nearest neighbors , the probability of cycle formation is strongly dependent on the global properties of the graph , which evolve as the network is being constructed . in our model",
    "there is a competition between successful searches , which increase the degree of two nodes and leave the number of nodes unaltered , and unsuccessful searches , which increase the degree of an existing node but also create a new node with degree one .",
    "successful searches lower the mean distance of a node to other nodes , and failed searches increase this distance .",
    "this has a stabilizing effect  a nonzero rate of failed searches",
    "is needed to increase distances so that future searches can succeed . using this mechanism to grow",
    "the network ensures that local connectivity structures , in terms of the mean distance of a node to other nodes , are somewhat similar across nodes thus creating long - range correlations between nodes .",
    "because these involve long - range interactions , we check whether the resulting degree distributions can be described by the form @xmath31 where the _ @xmath0-exponential _",
    "function @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33^{{1}/{(1-q ) } } \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( e_{1}^{x } = e^{x } )     \\label{eq5}\\ ] ]    if @xmath34 , and zero otherwise .",
    "this reduces to the usual exponential function when @xmath35 , but when @xmath36 it asymptotically approaches a power law in the limit @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath38 , the case of interest here , it asymptotically decays to zero .",
    "the factor @xmath39 coincides with @xmath40 if and only if @xmath41 ; @xmath42 is a characteristic degree number .",
    "the @xmath0-exponential function arises naturally as the solution of the equation @xmath43 , which occurs as the leading behavior at some critical points .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite to arise as the stationary solution of a nonlinear fokker - planck equation also known as the _ porous medium equation_. various mesoscopic mechanisms ( involving multiplicative noise ) have already been identified which yield this type of solution @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath0-exponential distribution also emerges from maximizing the entropy @xmath44 @xcite under a constraint that characterizes the number of degrees per node of the distribution .",

    "( [ constr2 ] ) . both constraints ( [ constr1 ] ) and ( [ constr2 ] ) impose @xmath52 .",
    "now to arrive at the ansatz ( [ eq4 ] ) that we have used in this paper , we must provide some plausibility to the factor @xmath53 in front of the @xmath0-exponential .",
    "it happens this factor is the most frequent form of density of states in condensed matter physics ( it exactly corresponds to systems of arbitrary dimensionality whose quantum energy spectrum is proportional to an arbitrary power of the wave - vector of the particles or quasi - particles ; depending on the system , @xmath54 can be positive , negative , or zero , in which case the ansatz reproduces a simple @xmath0-exponential ) . such density of states concurrently multiplies the boltzmann - gibbs factor , which is here naturally represented by @xmath55 .",
    "in addition to this , ansatz ( [ eq4 ] ) provided very satisfactory results in financial models where a plausible scale - free network basis was given to account for the distribution of stock trading volumes @xcite .",
    "an interesting financial mechanism using multiplicative noise has been recently proposed @xcite which precisely leads to a stationary state distribution of the form ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "it is for this ensemble of heuristic reasons that we checked the form ( 4 ) .",
    "the numerical results that we obtained proved a posteriori that this choice was a good one .",
