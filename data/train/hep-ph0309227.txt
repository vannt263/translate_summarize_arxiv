    "soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite provides a systematic framework in which to discuss the factorization properties of exclusive @xmath2-decay amplitudes for processes in which the external hadronic states contain highly energetic , collinear partons inside light final - state mesons , and soft partons inside the initial @xmath2 meson .",
    "power counting in scet is based on an expansion parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the large energy carried by collinear particles ( typically @xmath5 in @xmath2 decays ) and @xmath6 is of order the qcd scale .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "three of us have argued that the intricate interplay between soft and collinear degrees of freedom makes it necessary to introduce modes with virtuality @xmath7 , which have unsuppressed interactions with soft and collinear fields . in the strong - interaction sector of scet , the leading - order couplings of these `` soft - collinear '' fields to soft or collinear particles can be removed using field redefinitions , leaving residual interactions that are suppressed by at least two powers of @xmath8 . a puzzling aspect of this analysis was the finding that soft - collinear modes have virtualities that are parametrically below the qcd scale .",
    "we argued that this is to some extent a consequence of dimensional regularization and analyticity . what matters is not the virtuality but the fact that the plus and minus components of soft - collinear momenta are commensurate with certain components of collinear or soft momenta .",
    "yet , one might worry whether the scaling laws derived for interactions of the soft - collinear fields might be invalidated by some non - perturbative effects , thereby upsetting the power counting of the effective theory .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to build up confidence in the new modes by showing explicitly that they are necessary to correctly reproduce the _ ultraviolet _ ( uv ) behavior of the effective theory , which has to match the scale dependence of short - distance coefficient functions derived in the matching of full - theory amplitudes onto matrix elements of scet operators .",
    "specifically , we compute the anomalous dimensions of the leading - order current operators containing a heavy and a collinear quark , a soft and a collinear quark , and four - quark operators obtained from combining these two currents .",
    "we find that without the inclusion of soft - collinear fields the results for the anomalous dimensions would be incorrect and violate fundamental principles of renormalization theory , such as the independence of renormalization - group ( rg ) functions of infrared ( ir ) regulators .",
    "the explicit examples we investigate exhibit two other important features : first , in the presence of external operators such as flavor - changing currents , the soft - collinear fields can in general no longer be decoupled at leading order in @xmath9 using field redefinitions .",
    "their effects must therefore be studied carefully in applications of scet to exclusive @xmath2 decays .",
    "this complicates proofs of qcd factorization theorems .",
    "secondly , only the sum of soft , collinear and soft - collinear contributions to an amplitude is physically meaningful . through the particular scaling @xmath10 of soft - collinear momenta",
    "the amplitude becomes sensitive to the large scale @xmath11 .",
    "part of this sensitivity has a short - distance interpretation , as reflected in the anomalous dimensions of scet operators .",
    "however , in cases where the soft - collinear modes can not be decoupled , amplitudes may contain additional dependence on the large scale that is of ir origin . in a strongly coupled theory such as qcd",
    "this dependence can not be factorized using rg techniques .",
    "the construction of an effective theory for collinear particles must account for the fact that different components of particle momenta and fields scale differently with the large scale @xmath11 . to make this scaling explicit one introduces two light - like vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14 and @xmath15 . typically , @xmath16 is chosen to be the direction of an outgoing fast hadron ( or a jet of hadrons ) , and @xmath17 points in the opposite direction .",
    "any 4-vector can be decomposed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "this relation defines the light - like vectors @xmath20 .",
    "the relevant scet degrees of freedom describing the partons in the external hadronic states of exclusive @xmath2 decays are soft and collinear , where @xmath21 for soft momenta and @xmath22 for collinear momenta . here and below we indicate the scaling properties of the components @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding effective - theory fields and their scaling relations are @xmath24 ( soft heavy quark ) , @xmath25 ( soft light quark ) , @xmath26 ( soft gluon ) , and @xmath27 ( collinear quark ) , @xmath28 ( collinear gluon ) . at leading order in power counting",
    "the effective strong - interaction lagrangian splits up into separate lagrangians for the soft and collinear fields .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the effective theory also contains soft - collinear quark and gluon fields , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which have leading - order couplings to both soft and collinear fields .",
    "the formalism incorporating these fields has been developed in @xcite , borrowing methods developed by beneke and feldmann @xcite .",
    "it will be briefly reviewed here .    in interactions with other fields , the soft - collinear fields ( but not the soft and collinear fields ) are multipole expanded as @xmath31 the first correction terms are of @xmath32 , and the omitted terms are of @xmath33 and higher .",
    "soft - collinear fields can couple to soft or collinear fields without altering their scaling properties .",
    "this motivates the treatment of the soft - collinear gluon field as a background field .",
    "however , in order to preserve the scaling properties of the fields under gauge transformations one must expand the transformation laws in @xmath9 .",

    ", we have explicitly shown that they are needed for obtaining the correct ultraviolet behavior of effective theory amplitudes .",
    "the explicit examples we have investigated show that only the sum of soft , collinear and soft - collinear contributions to an amplitude is physically meaningful . in cases",
    "where the soft - collinear modes can not be decoupled by field redefinitions , scet amplitudes become sensitive to the large scale @xmath11 through the particular scaling @xmath154 of soft - collinear momenta .",
    "only part of this sensitivity is of a short - distance nature , as described by the anomalous dimensions of scet operators .",
    "in addition , amplitudes may contain a long - distance dependence on the large scale that can not be factorized using renormalization - group techniques .    in the strong - interaction sector of scet the leading - order interactions of soft - collinear fields with soft or collinear fields can be removed using field redefinitions , leaving residual interactions that are power suppressed . in the presence of external operators",
    "this decoupling property is no longer guaranteed , but depends on whether external operators remain invariant under the decoupling transformation .",
    "we have shown , for instance , that currents containing a soft and a collinear quark are not invariant , implying that the effects of soft - collinear contributions to current matrix elements must be studied carefully .    in summary , we have completed the discussion of the scet lagrangian at leading power and including external operators relevant to weak interactions .",
    "the framework developed here forms the basis for systematic , complete proofs of qcd factorization theorems for exclusive @xmath2-meson decay amplitudes .",
    "in particular , our finding of the decoupling of soft - collinear contributions for color singlet - singlet four - quark operators completes the proof of factorization for the decay @xmath153 .    _",
