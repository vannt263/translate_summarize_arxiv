    "most communication systems take into account not only the reliability but also the security of the data they transmit .",
    "this is particularly true in wireless environment , where the data is inherently more sensible to security threats .",
    "consequently , the design of such systems need to include both coding schemes for providing error - correction and ciphering algorithms for encryption - decryption .",
    "it is common practice to first encrypt the data to ensure its safety , and then to encode it for reliability . in this paper",
    ", we consider the reverse scenario , namely systems which first encode the data , and then encrypt it , which we call the _ encoding - encryption paradigm_.    though counter - intuitive at first , there are actually many real life applications where the encoding encryption paradigm is used .",
    "a famous illustrative example is the most widespread standard for mobile telephony gsm , standing for  global system for mobile communications \" ( see @xcite and @xcite , for the coding , respectively security details ) . in the gsm protocol ,",
    "the data is first encoded using an error - correction code so as to withstand reception errors , which considerably increases the size of the message to be transmitted .",
    "the encoded data is then encrypted to provide privacy ( secrecy of the communications ) for the users .",
    "it is interesting to mention that block ciphers are not suitable in the context of the encoding - encryption paradigm , since the receiver needs to first decrypt the data despite the noise , before performing the decoding .",
    "this leads to use of stream ciphers and thus when we refer to the security of systems using the encoding - encryption paradigm , we implicitly mean the security of the keystream generator and the users secret key .    from a security perspective",
    ", there are of course pros and cons to the encoding - encryption paradigm .",
    "since it implies encryption of redundant data ( introduced by error - correction ) , it could be an origin for mounting attacks against the employed keystream generator .",
    "undesirability of redundant data from a cryptographic security point of view has indeed been already pointed out in the seminal work by shannon @xcite , where cryptography as a scientific topic has been established . on the other hand ,",
    "the encoding - encryption paradigm has the advantage to offer protection in the case of a known plaintext attacking scenario , since an adversary can only learn a noisy version of the keystream , which makes the cryptanalyis of the employed keystream generator more complex .",
    "security evaluation can be performed under two attacking scenarios , depending on whether one considers an active or passive adversary .    a _ passive adversary _",
    "s ability is limited to monitoring ( and recording ) communications between the legitimate parties , so as to use the recorded data as input for mounting a _ known plaintext attack _ against the considered system .",
    "stronger attacks come from _ active adversaries _ , which can possibly include many attacking settings . in this paper",
    ", we consider active attacks motivated by the class of so - called hopper and blum ( hb ) authentication protocols @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . following the original work by @xcite ,",
    "hb authentication protocols are challenge - response based , where the response could be considered as the encoded and encrypted version of the challenge , which is deliberately degraded by random noise . a simple active attack on the improved hb@xmath0 authentication protocol @xcite was provided in @xcite , where it is assumed that an adversary can manipulate challenges sent during the authentication exchange , and thus learn whether such manipulations give an authentication failure .",
    "the attack consists of choosing a constant vector and using it to perturb the challenges by computing the xor of the selected vector with each authentication challenge vector , and that for each of the authentication rounds .",
    "to summarize , the active attacker has the following abilities : ( i ) he can modify the data in the communication channel between the legitimate parties ; and ( ii ) he can can learn the effect of the performed modification at the receiving side .",
    "this is the model that will be adopted in this work .",
    "to evaluate the security of systems using the encoding - encryption paradigm under threats of both passive and active adversaries as described above , both computational and information theoretical analyses are valid . in this paper , we focus on the latter .",
    "we propose a security enhanced approach which employs a dedicated coding , following the frameworks of homophonic @xcite and wire - tap channel coding @xcite .",
    "the improved security is a consequence of combining the pure randomness introduced by the wire - tap coding and the random noise which is inherent in the communication channel .",
    "we measure the security increase with respect to the secret key in terms of its equivocation , that is the amount of uncertainty that the adversary has on the key , given all the information he can collect .",
    "a preliminary study of the security enhancement has been provided in in the case of a passive adversary .",
    "the enhancement is based on the constructions reported in @xcite , and also motivated by the fact that in the computational complexity evaluation scenarios , this approach provides resistance against the generic time - memory trade - off based attacking approaches @xcite , and particular powerful techniques like the correlation attacks @xcite .    _",
    "motivation for the work_. the aim of this work is to propose and elaborate a model for the security evaluation of communication systems which employ the encoding - encryption paradigm together with a dedicated wire - tap encoder for security enhancement . in a general security evaluation scenario ,",
    "both passive and active attacks should be treated , and while the enhanced system should be resistant to these , it should be with a slight / moderate increase of the implementation complexity and the communications overhead .",
    "it may be worth emphasizing that our target is to increase the security of existing schemes , such as gsm , which is why we have a small margin of freedom in designing the security scheme , since we can not touch most of the existing components of the system .",
    "_ summary of the results_. this paper proposes and analyzes from the information - theoretic point of view the security of communications systems based on the encoding - encryption paradigm under passive and active attacks , when equipped with an additional wire - tap encoder .",
    "we show that with the aid of a dedicated wire - tap encoder , the amount of uncertainty that the adversary must face about the secret key given all the information he could gather during different passive or active attacks he can mount , is a decreasing function of the sample available for cryptanalysis .",
    "this means that the wire - tap encoder can indeed provide an information theoretical security level over a period of time , but after a large enough sample is collected the function tends to zero , entering a regime in which a computational security analysis is needed for estimation of the resistance against the secret key recovery .    _",
    "organization of the paper_. in section [ sec : model ] , we start by describing precisely the system model together with its security enhanced version and we dedicate subsection [ subsec : wiretap ] to the design of the wire - tap encoder .",
    "the security analysis is done in two parts : first the passive adversary is studied in section [ sec : passive ] , while the active one is investigated in section [ sec : active ] .",
    "practical implications of the given security analysis and some guidelines for design of security enhanced encoding - encryption based systems are pointed out in section [ sec : appli ] . concluding remarks including some directions for future work are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a class of communication systems which , to provide both reliability and security , employs the encoding and then encryption paradigm , namely : the message is first encoded , and then encrypted using a stream ciphering .",
    "the detailed model is shown in figure [ fig : figure-1 ] .",
    "the transmitter first encodes a binary message / plain text @xmath1_{i=1}^m \\in \\{0,1\\}^m\\ ] ] using an error - correcting code @xmath2 @xmath3_{i=1}^n\\in\\{0,1\\}^n,\\ ] ] that maps a @xmath4-dimensional plain text to an @xmath5-dimensional encoded message , @xmath6 .",
    "the encryption is done using a keystream generator , which takes as input the secret key @xmath7 of the transmitter , and outputs @xmath8_{i=1}^n\\in\\{0,1\\}^n\\ ] ] yielding @xmath9_{i=1}^n\\in\\{0,1\\}^n\\ ] ] as the message to be sent over the noisy channel , where @xmath10 denotes xor or modulo 2 addition .",
    "we denote the noise vector by @xmath11_{i=1}^{n}\\in\\{0,1\\}^n\\ ] ] where each @xmath12 is the realization of a random variable @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 . upon reception of the corrupted encrypted binary sequence of ciphertext @xmath16_{i=1}^n \\in\\{0,1\\}^n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the receiver who shares",
    "the secret key @xmath7 with the transmitter can decrypt first the message @xmath17 and then decode @xmath18 despite of the noise thanks to the error - correction code .",
    "we remark that in practice a keystream generator can be considered as a finite state machine whose initial state is determined by the secret key and some public data . for simplicity , and because it does not affect our analysis , we can ignore the existence of the known data , and focus on the secret key . in this setting the output of the keystream generator is determined uniquely by the secret key , and it is enough to assume that the transmitter and receiver only share the key .    note further that the trick of reversing the order of encryption and error - correction would not have been possible if a block cipher was used for encryption , since decryption must be done before removing the channel noise .",
    "we finally assume that there is a noiseless feedback link that connects the receiver to the transmitter , so that the receiver can either acknowledge the reception of the message , or inform of the decoding failure , so as to get the missing message sent back .",
    "origins for the construction given in this paper are the approaches for stream ciphers design recently reported in @xcite , though the focus of this paper is very different , since its goal is enhancing the security of existing encryption schemes .",
    "this difference has a number of implications regarding the security issues and implementation complexity of the scheme .",
    "the construction proposed in this paper employs the following main underlying ideas for enhancing security :    * involve pure randomness into the coding&ciphering scheme so that the decoding complexity without knowledge of the secret key employed in the system approaches the complexity of the exhaustive search for the secret key .",
    "* enhance security of the existing stream cipher via joint employment of pure randomness and coding theory , and particularly a dedicated encoding following the homophonic or wire - tap channel encoding approaches .",
    "* allow a suitable trade - off between the security and the communications rate : increase the security towards the limit implied by the secret - key length at the expense of a low - moderate decrease of the communications rate .    regarding the homophonic and wire - tap channel coding , note the following . the main goals of homophonic coding are to provide : ( i ) multiple substitutions of a given source vector via randomness so that the coded versions of the source vectors appear as realizations of a random source ; ( ii ) recoverability of the source vector based on the given codeword without knowledge of the randomization .",
    "the main goals of wire - tap channel coding are : ( i ) amplification of the noise difference between the main and wire - tap channel via randomness ; ( ii ) a reliable transmission in the main channel and at the same time to provide a total confusion of the wire - tapper who observes the communication in the main channel via a noisy channel ( wire - tap channel ) .",
    "accordingly , homophonic coding schemes and wire - tap channel ones have different goals and belong to different coding classes , the source coding and the error - correction ones , but they employ the same underlying ideas of using randomness and dedicated coding for achieving the desired goals .    for enhancing the security",
    "we exploit the underlying approaches of universal homophonic coding @xcite and generic wire - tap coding when the main channel is error - free ( see @xcite and @xcite , for example ) .",
    "accordingly , we may say either `` homophonic coding '' or `` wire - tap channel coding '' to address the dedicated coding that enhances security .",
    "the main feature of the dedicated coding is that the encoding is based on randomness and that the legitimate receiving party who shares a secret key with the corresponding transmitting one can perform decoding without knowledge of the randomness employed for the encoding . for simplicity of the terminology",
    "we mainly ( but not always ) say `` wire - tap channel coding '' to describe the dedicated coding which provides the enhanced security .",
    "let @xmath19 denote a wiretap or homophonic code encoder . to enhance the security of the system considered",
    ", it is added at the transmitter end ( see figure [ fig : figure-2 ] ) involving a vector of pure randomness @xmath20_{i=1}^{m-\\ell } \\in \\{0,1\\}^{m - l},\\ ] ] that is , each @xmath21 is the realization of a random variable @xmath22 with distribution @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath19 is invertible .",
    "the wiretap encoding is done prior to error - correcting encoding , thus out of the @xmath4 bits of data to be sent , @xmath24 are replaced by random data , letting actually only @xmath25 bits @xmath1_{i=1}^l \\in \\{0,1\\}^l\\ ] ] of plaintext , to get as in ( [ eq : y ] ) @xmath26 as codeword to be sent .        as before , the receiver obtains @xmath27 and starts with the decryption @xmath28 he then first decodes @xmath29 if the decoding is successful , he computes @xmath18 using @xmath30 and",
    "let the transmitter know he could decode .",
    "otherwise he informs the transmitter than retransmission is required .",
    "similarly to a linear error - correction code where @xmath2 can be represented by multiplying the data vector by the generator matrix of the code , we can write @xmath31 , following the so - called coset encoding proposed by wyner @xcite , as follows : @xmath32 \\left [ \\begin{array}{l } { \\bf h}_1\\\\ { \\bf h}_2\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ { \\bf h}_l\\\\ { \\bf g}^c \\end{array } \\right ] =   [ { \\bf a}|| { \\bf u } ] { \\bf g}_h,\\ ] ] where    * @xmath33 is a @xmath34 generator matrix for a @xmath35 linear error - correction code @xmath36 with rows @xmath37 , * @xmath38 are @xmath25 linearly independent row vectors from @xmath39 , * and @xmath40 is a @xmath41 binary matrix corresponding to @xmath19 .    in words , to each @xmath25-bit message @xmath42 $ ] is associated a coset determined by @xmath43 though this correspondence is deterministic , a random codeword @xmath44 is chosen inside the coset by : @xmath45 where @xmath46 $ ] is a uniformly distributed random @xmath47-bit vector .      in our scenario",
    ", we need to combine wiretap encoding with error - correction encoding , both being linear operations .",

    "the statement is intuitively clear .",
    "the security depends on the length @xmath154 of the key noting that this length is fixed in the system .",
    "accordingly , when the keystream generator is used for a period @xmath151 that varies , as long as @xmath200 , the key is protected by the randomness of the noisy channel and of the wiretap encoder , but that protection can not last forever if the adversary collects too much data .",

    "while the transmitter sends @xmath203 in an already security enhances setting ( [ eq : ych ] ) , the receiver sees its noisy version @xmath204 the active adversary is allowed to inject some extra noise @xmath205 over the channel , so that now , the legitimate receiver sees @xmath206 , where @xmath207 contains both the noise @xmath208 coming from the channel and the noise @xmath205 controlled by the adversary : @xmath209 as earlier ( section [ sec : model ] ) , the receiver first decrypts its message using its secret key and locally generated keystream @xmath210 and then try to decode @xmath211 : @xmath212 under the assumption that the error correcting code can correct the errors introduced by @xmath213 , so as to get @xmath214 because of the extra noise @xmath215 , the probability of decoding correctly at the receiver may decrease . in the meantime",
    ", the active attacker can listen to the feedback channel so that he knows whether the decoding failed or was successful .",
    "his goal is again to find the key .",
    "his strategy then consists in adding different noise vectors @xmath215 and to observe the feedback channel to see whether the chosen noise made the decoding fail , in order to gather information .",
    "we keep our earlier notation , that is    * @xmath21 , random bits used in the wiretap encoder , * @xmath82 , output bits of the keystream generator , * @xmath216 , random components of the additive noise @xmath217 , * @xmath85 , bits of the plain text , * @xmath97 , bits of the received message    are realizations of certain random variables @xmath22 , @xmath83 , @xmath218 , @xmath13 , @xmath219 , @xmath98 , @xmath84 and @xmath86 , @xmath220 .",
    "the corresponding vectors of random variables are denoted as follows : @xmath87_{i=1}^{\\ell}$ ] , @xmath88_{i=1}^{m-\\ell}$ ] , @xmath89_{i=1}^n$ ] , @xmath221_{i=1}^n$ ] , @xmath222_{i=1}^n$ ] , @xmath223_{i=1}^n$ ] , and @xmath100_{i=1}^n$ ] . similarly to ( [ eq : z2 ] ) , @xmath224    finally , let @xmath225 be a binary flag which indicates whether the decoding result is indeed @xmath226 or has failed , and accordingly @xmath225 can be considered as a realization of a binary random variable @xmath227 .",
    "the lemma below gives a bound on the resistance of the scheme to an active attack where the adversary not only controls the noise but also knows @xmath228 and @xmath225 .",
    "[ lem : boundactive ] the equivocation of the keystream segment knowing the plaintext , the received signal , and the decoding tag , can be lower bounded as follows : @xmath229 where @xmath230 since @xmath231 .    as in lemma",
    "[ lem : bound ] , we start with two different chain rule decompositions of the same joint entropy . on the one hand , @xmath232 since from ( [ eq : z2act ] ) we have that @xmath233 implying @xmath234 , and @xmath235 , since knowing @xmath236 and @xmath237 , decoding can be performed on @xmath238 and the decoded value can be compared to @xmath236 , yielding @xmath227 .    on the other hand , @xmath239 noticing that @xmath240 again using from ( [ eq : z2act ] ) that @xmath241 , and that @xmath242 for the same reason as above .    by combining the two decompositions",
    ", we deduce that @xmath243 where @xmath244 since @xmath245 implies that @xmath246 and conditioning reduces entropy , namely , @xmath247    similarly , again using ( [ eq : z2act ] ) and that @xmath248 we obtain that @xmath249    to summarize , equation ( [ eq : hxaz ] ) is now given by @xmath250 where @xmath251 and @xmath252 is known to the adversary , so that we in fact have @xmath253 using further that @xmath126 and @xmath127 are mutually independent .",
    "we are finally left with bounding @xmath254 . for the adversary ,",
    "recovering @xmath132 when @xmath133 , @xmath126 and @xmath134 are given is the decoding problem of removing the noise @xmath127 ( he knows @xmath255 ) employing the code @xmath2 with error probability @xmath135 . this can be bounded",
    "using fano s inequality : @xmath256 since knowing whether the receiver could decode the worst noise does not affect the error capability of @xmath2 .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "let us compare the result of lemmas [ lem : bound ] and [ lem : boundactive ] : @xmath257 where @xmath230 since @xmath231 . as expected , the equivocation in the case of an active adversary is smaller than for a passive adversary , since @xmath258 .",
    "based on the above , we easily get a counterpart of theorem [ theor : pass ] for the case of an active adversary .",
    "[ theor : act ] when @xmath165 , @xmath84 , @xmath166 , there exists a threshold @xmath259 such that @xmath260 we have that @xmath261 , the threshold for a passive adversary .",
    "when @xmath169 , @xmath170 , lemma [ lem : bound ] directly implies that @xmath262 is achievable .",
    "when @xmath173 grows , we know from ( [ eq : hkaz ] ) that @xmath263 now it is shown in the proof of theorem [ theor : pass ] that every term tends to zero , using a decoding argument , which will hold similarly here , since the knowledge of @xmath227 can not make the decoding more difficult .",
    "this section provides a generic discussion of the usefulness and possible applications of the proposed approach .",
    "the analysis given in sections [ sec : passive ] and [ sec : active ] shows that in systems where the encoding - encryption paradigm is employed , involvement of pure randomness via concatenation of dedicated wire - tap and error - correction coding ( instead of error - correction only ) provides an increased cryptographic security , by combining pseudo - randomness , randomness and coding , which in a known - plaintext cryptanalytic scenario implies an increased resistance against threats on the secret key .",
    "the performed information - security evaluation more precisely points out the following desirable security properties of the proposed approach : ( i ) when the sample available for cryptanalysis is below a certain size , the scheme provides uncertainty about the secret key ; ( ii ) complexity of the secret key recovery appears as a highly computationally complex problem even if the available sample is such that the posterior uncertainty about the secret key tends to zero .",
    "the main consequence of ( i ) is that even if exhaustive search were to be employed for the secret key recovery , a ( large ) number of candidates will appear .",
    "the statement ( ii ) is an implication of the proofs of theorems 1 and 2 , where the reduction to zero of the posterior uncertainty about the secret key appears assuming employment of a decoding which has complexity proportional to the exhaustive search over all possible secret keys .",
    "accordingly , the uncertainty tends to zero at the expense of a decoding with exponential complexity .",
    "actually , the decrease of the uncertainty about the secret key with the increase of the sample available for cryptanalysis appears as a consequence of decoding capabilities of a low rate random binary block codes , but at the expense of the decoding complexity which is exponential in the secret key length .",
    "the above features ( i ) and ( ii ) hold not only in a passive attacking scenario where the attacker performs cryptanalysis based on recording the ciphertext from a public communication channels , but also in certain active attacking scenarios where the attacker can modify the ciphertext and learn the effects of these modifications .",
    "the encoding - encryption paradigm for secure and reliable communications enjoys the following desirable properties : ( i ) when the decryption is performed by bitwise xoring the keystream to the ciphertext , an error in a bit before decryption causes an error in the corresponding bit after decryption , without any error - propagation , and ( ii ) provides non - availability of the error - free keystream when the communication channel is a noisy one .",
    "the proposed approach for enhancing the security of the communications systems which follow encoding - encryption paradigm could be employed in the design of these systems from scratch as well as in upgrading of the existing ones .    in the case of upgrading the existing systems ,",
    "the implementation assumption is that the employed , already existing , binary linear block error - correction code @xmath264 which encodes @xmath4 bits into a codeword from @xmath265 , could be replaced with a binary block code @xmath266 with the same error correction capability but with @xmath267 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath268 random bits can be concatenated with @xmath4 information bits and mapped into the new @xmath4-bits via a homophonic encoder .",
    "the obtained output from homophonic encoder is the input for the error - correcting one .",
    "taking into account the notation from section 2 , the previous means that instead of performing @xmath269 which is a linear mapping @xmath270 , the following should be performed : @xmath271 where @xmath272 is a concatenation of an @xmath4-dimensional vector and an @xmath268-dimensional one , @xmath19 is a linear mapping @xmath273 and @xmath55 is a linear mapping @xmath274 . on the receiving side ,",
    "the decoding procedures after decryption are straightforward ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : the error correction decoding removes the random errors , and the message @xmath226 is obtained by truncating of the inverse linear mapping corresponding to the homophonic decoding .    in the case of a design of the encoding - encryption system from the scratch",
    ", the design should include a coding box which performs the concatenation of homophonic and error - correction coding in a manner which fits the rate of the concatenated code to the given constraints .",
    "note that from an implementation point of view , replacement of a linear block encoding by a concatenation of a block linear homophonic and error correction encoding is a replacement of one binary matrix with another binary matrix which is the product of the matrices corresponding to the homophonic and error - correction encoders .",
    "accordingly , the implementation complexity of two concatenated codes could be approximately the same as the implementation complexity of an error correcting code only .",
    "the problem addressed in this paper is the one of enhancing security of certain communications systems which employ error correction encoding of the messages and encryption of the obtained codewords in order to provide both secrecy and reliability of the transmission .",
    "this paper yields a proposal for providing the enhanced security of the considered systems employing randomness and dedicated coding and the information - theoretic security evaluation of the proposed approach .",
    "the analysis given in this paper implies that in the systems where the encoding - encryption paradigm is employed , the cryptographic security can be enhanced via involvement of a homophonic coding based on pure randomness as follows : instead of just error - correction encoding before the encryption , this paper proposes employment of a concatenation of linear block homophonic and error - correction encoding .",
    "the proposal and its cryptographic security evaluation are given in a generic manner and accordingly yield a generic framework for particular applications .",
    "note that the information - theoretic consideration of the cryptographic security yields a basic evaluation of the related cryptographic features . on the other hand",
    ", the information - theoretic security evaluation also provides specification of the settings when it is possible to perform the secret key recovery , but it does not specify and only indicates the expected complexity of this problem . we show that with the aid of a dedicated wire - tap encoder , the amount of uncertainty that the adversary has about the key given all the information he could gather during different passive or active attacks he can mount , is a decreasing function of the sample available for cryptanalysis .",
    "this means that the wire - tap encoder can indeed provide an information theoretical security level over a period of time , after which a large enough sample is collected and the function tends to zero , entering a regime in which a computational security analysis is needed .",
    "an interesting issue for further work is the characterization of the transition region in which the uncertainty drops from a certain value to close to zero .",
    "also , because after all , the uncertainty tends to zero , the computational complexity based evaluation of cryptographic security is a direction for a future work .",
