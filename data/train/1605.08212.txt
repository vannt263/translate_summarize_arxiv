    "emission lines of iron group elements , particularly of fe and ni , show rich spectra covering a wide wavelength range in a variety of solar and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "their lines are observed from almost all ionisation stages as may be noted from the _ atomic line list ( v2.04 ) _ of peter van hoof ( @xmath5 ) , chianti database @xcite at @xmath6 and the atomic and molecular database stout @xcite .",
    "similarly , many of these elements are also useful for studies of fusion plasmas .",
    "however , to reliably model the spectral lines in plasmas , atomic data are required for several parameters , such as energy levels and radiative rates ( @xmath3-values ) .",
    "therefore , over the past few decades several workers have reported data for many such ions , including ourselves  see for example @xcite .",
    "however , ( in general ) most of the work has been performed for highly ionised systems and comparatively less attention has been paid to the lowly ionised species .",
    "this is because such ions are more problematic and usually require much larger calculations to achieve a reasonably satisfactory level of accuracy .",
    "iron is a very important element for both astrophysical and fusion plasma studies , and emission and absorption lines of fe  v have been observed in many hot stars and nebulae  see for example , kramida @xcite and references therein .",
    "its lines have also been observed in white dwarfs @xcite and are useful for the study of the fine - structure constant in a gravitational field .",
    "the first investigation of the fe  v spectrum was undertaken as early as 1937 by bowen @xcite , who identified 57 levels of the 3d@xmath1 , 3d@xmath24s and 3d@xmath24p configurations .",
    "this study was subsequently extended by other workers , such as @xcite .",
    "therefore , a very rich experimental spectrum of high accuracy , involving as many as 982 lines , is available for this ion @xcite .",
    "a critical compilation of all measured lines of several ions with 19 @xmath7 z @xmath7 28 was undertaken by sugar and corliss @xcite , and their recommended energy levels are also available on the nist ( national institute of standards and technology ) website http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/asd.cfm @xcite .",
    "later , azarov et al .",
    "@xcite also measured many lines of the 3d@xmath24d and 3d@xmath25s configurations of fe  v. a similar situation exists for co  vi @xcite , and as for fe  v , its lines were studied as early as 1938 @xcite .",
    "however , the observed spectrum of ni  vii is not as rich as for the other ti - like ions fe  v and co  vi , because many levels are missing for the 3d@xmath1 and 3d@xmath24p configurations and none has been measured for 3d@xmath24s  see table  [ ene - ni7 ] or the nist website .",
    "additionally , the situation regarding radiative data ( @xmath3-values ) is even worse , particularly for co  vi and ni  vii , although some results are available for fe  v @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we calculate energy levels and @xmath3-values for three ti - like ions , namely fe  v , co  vi and ni  vii .",
    "as noted above , calculations for lowly ionised ions are generally not straightforward , and hence require a significant amount of effort .",
    "this also applies to ti - like species .",
    "early calculations for energy levels were performed by ekberg @xcite , who adopted a least - square fit to the observed values , apart from applying a few corrections . in spite of this , differences between the observed and calculated energies are between @xmath8299 and @xmath9470 @xmath10 ( see tables iii  v of @xcite ) , although they equate to less than 0.2% .",
    "later , omalley et al .",
    "@xcite performed relativistic configuration interaction ( rci ) calculations with @xmath11 vectors , and determined energies for 5 ( @xmath12 ) levels of the 3d@xmath1 and 19 ( @xmath13 ) of 3d@xmath24p configurations .",
    "they achieved a good accuracy within @xmath14 of the measurements  see their table  iii .",
    "the largest _ ab initio _ calculation available so far is by nahar and pradhan @xcite , who adopted the breit - pauli @xmath15-matrix method to calculate energies for 3865 levels of fe  v. however , the main problem with their work is that differences with measurements are up to 10% , for several levels and of all configurations  see their table  iii or table  iii of @xcite for a shorter version .",
    "the most difficult to determine are the energy levels of the 3d@xmath1 configuration , as may also be noted from table  1 of ballance et al .",
    "@xcite , who adopted the general - purpose relativistic atomic structure package ( grasp ) to calculate energies for 359 levels of the 3d@xmath1 , 3d@xmath24s , 3d@xmath24p , 3d@xmath24d , and 3d@xmath164s@xmath17 configurations .",
    "since their focus was on the calculation of collisional data , they could only include a limited ci ( configuration interaction ) , but differences between their energies and those of nist are up to @xmath18 for several levels , particularly those belonging to 3d@xmath1 .",
    "adopting the same grasp code as by @xcite , we have performed our calculations with much more extensive ci , but differences with the nist compilation remain significant , both in magnitude and orderings , particularly for the lowest 34 levels of the 3d@xmath1 configuration . therefore , we employed the flexible atomic code ( fac ) of gu  @xcite which ( generally ) provides results of comparable accuracy with other atomic structure codes , but is much more efficient to run and hence saves both computational and human time . unfortunately , the results obtained with this code are as unsatisfactory as with grasp . to be specific , we included ci with up to 100915 levels ( @xmath19 ) , but differences in energy for the levels of the 3d@xmath1 configuration of fe  v are up to 15% , as shown in table  [ table_a ] .",
    "therefore , it became clear that we either have to extend the ci to a much higher order , or have to apply another approach , such as the use of non - orthogonal orbitals .",
    "however , having recently gained experience from our work on cr - like ions @xcite , we have employed the quasi - relativistic approximation ( qr ) @xcite .",
    "in this work we investigate the lowest two even - parity configurations 3d@xmath1 and 3d@xmath24s with 72 energy levels and one odd - parity configuration 3d@xmath24p with 110 levels .",
    "we utilise the quasi - relativistic ( qr ) approach @xcite as it was done in our previous studies @xcite of spectroscopic parameters for iron peak elements . at the start of the calculations we solve quasi - relativistic hartree - fock equations ( qrhf ) @xcite for the ground configuration , and determine all one - electron radial orbitals ( ro ) for electrons with principal quantum number @xmath20 .",
    "next we solve qrhf equations in the frozen - core potential for all @xmath21 electrons ( @xmath22 ) for the configurations 3d@xmath24@xmath23 .",
    "subsequently the determined ro basis is extended by including transformed radial orbitals ( tro ) @xcite to effectively account for correlation effects @xcite .",
    "tros are determined for electrons with principal quantum number @xmath24 and all allowed values of the orbital quantum number @xmath25 . using this methodology ,",
    "our basis consists of 55 ros .",
    "the same ros are utilised both for even and odd configurations . this way we avoid issues with ro non - orthogonality , important in the calculation of radiative transitions .",
    "inaccuracies in level energies arising from that approximation are minimised by the adoption of a large ci basis .",
    "the correlation effects are included using the ci method .",
    "therefore a list of admixed configurations ( ac ) is constructed for each investigated configuration ( adjusted configuration ) .",
    "this ac list is composed by including one- and two - electron promotions from the active shells ( @xmath26 and @xmath21 ) of the investigated configuration to all those of the same parity , which can be described by the ro basis generated earlier .",
    "the presence of various admixed configurations in the ci basis dictates what kind of additional symmetries are included in the eigen - functions of the investigated configurations .",
    "thus the number of acs can be considered as the main criterion for the inclusion of electron correlation effects .",
    "the adopted ro basis includes one - electron radial orbitals having orbital momenta from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "their combinations in the admixed configurations enable us to construct nearly all necessary symmetries of momenta .",
    "therefore the method of tro construction @xcite and extensive set of the principal quantum numbers @xmath29 ensures a very effective inclusion of the radial correlations .",
    "parameters of the calculation for the ti - like ions under consideration are presented in table  [ table_b ] .",
    "the large maximum numbers of ac for the even @xmath30 and odd @xmath31 configurations , together with possible configuration state function ( csf ) numbers ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) given in this table , indicate that it is impossible to include into the ci wavefunction expansion all csfs originating from the arranged ac sets .",
    "therefore one needs to select the admixed configurations according to their average contributions into the eigen - functions of the investigated configurations .",
    "the contributions are determined in the second order of the perturbation theory ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we apply the selection criteria @xmath34 , i.e. all acs with the average contribution @xmath35 are excluded from the calculations .    the two even - parity configurations , namely 3d@xmath24d and 3d@xmath174s@xmath17 , are close to the investigated configurations in their energies , and hence strongly affect these . to correctly determine their influence and to account more consistently for the 3- and 4-electron correlation corrections , the set of selected acs is extended by adding the admixed configurations that interact strongly with above mentioned ( 3d@xmath24d and 3d@xmath174s@xmath17 ) configurations .",
    "the selection criteria for these configurations is much larger ( @xmath36 ) . in the case of odd - parity configurations ,",
    "the additional admixed configurations are generated for the 3s@xmath173p@xmath373d@xmath37 , 3s@xmath173p@xmath383d@xmath24f , 3s@xmath173p@xmath383d@xmath174s4p , and 3s@xmath173p@xmath383d4s@xmath174p set of ac . the numbers @xmath39 in table  [ table_b ] represent the reduced ( even and odd ) configurations included in the ci basis , which are about 4 to 5 times smaller than the initial ones .",
    "a comparison of @xmath39 values for the three ions considered here demonstrates that , for the same configuration selection criteria @xmath40 , the number of selected configurations ( slightly ) decreases as the degree of ionisation increases .",
    "such behaviour confirms the well - known fact that the importance of correlation effects decreases with increase of the electrostatic potential affecting moving electrons .    while performing actual ci calculations , the value of the @xmath39 parameter is not so important compared to the number of csf ( @xmath41 ) generated by the configurations included in the ci basis .",
    "corresponding c - values for the even and odd configurations are also given in table  [ table_b ] .",
    "we note that their values are quite large ( e.g. @xmath42 ) , and it becomes time consuming to perform calculations for hamiltonian matrices of such sizes .    at the next step",
    "we reduce the number of csf , a procedure which relies on the relocation of the virtually excited electrons to the front of the active shells of ac .",
    "we further discard those csfs which have off - diagonal matrix elements of operator , describing electrostatic interaction with the investigated configurations , equal to zero @xcite .",
    "the numbers of csf after these reductions are given as @xmath43 and @xmath44 in table  [ table_b ] .",
    "one can see that this step reduces the basis of csfs by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "we note that this type of significant csf reduction does not affect the effectiveness of the ci wavefunction expansion .",
    "interestingly , while the ionisation degree increases and consequently the number of selected configurations @xmath39 decreases , the number @xmath15 of produced csfs increases .",
    "this behaviour demonstrates that the above described ac reduction procedure leads to the inclusion of different configurations for different degrees of ionisation in the isoelectronic sequence .",
    "therefore the values of @xmath15 can increase .    in our computational method ,",
    "the most important factor limiting the calculation is the number of csfs with the same total @xmath45 momenta .",
    "for the fe  v , co  vi , and ni  vii ti - like ions considered here , the largest number @xmath46 of same @xmath45 momenta is attributed to the @xmath2f term , both for even and odd configurations , given in table  [ table_b ] .",
    "it is clear that their values are proportional to @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "correlation effects are very important for medium ionisation stage ions with an open 3d shell .",
    "when we implement the ci model , we include a huge number of admixed interacting configurations , but our limited computing resources necessitate some compromises  see table  [ table_b ] .",
    "although each separate configuration can not significantly affect the calculated results , the combined influence of such ( omitted ) configurations is comparatively appreciable , and hence causes some discrepancies between the calculated and experimental level energies .",
    "therefore , we reduce integrals of the electrostatic interaction for all investigated configurations by @xmath47 , as in @xcite . such a minimal change of integral values noticeably reduces discrepancies in the theoretical level energies , leading to more accurate transition wavelengths .",
    "this in turn reduces the influence of errors in transition energies , and subsequently on transition parameters .",
    "relativistic effects are included in the breit - pauli approximation as described in @xcite .",
    "the level energies of the investigated configurations and their eigen - functions are determined by diagonalising the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "these data are utilised to determine radiative transition parameters for electric dipole ( e1 ) , electric octupole ( e3 ) , and magnetic dipole ( m2 ) transitions among the levels of even- and odd - parity configurations , and for magnetic dipole ( m1 ) and electric quadrupole ( e2 ) transitions among the levels of the same parity configurations ",
    "see section [ rad ] .",
    "these parameters are further used to determine the total radiative lifetimes @xmath48 of the excited levels . by utilising the determined ci wavefunctions",
    ", we also compute electron - impact excitation cross sections and rates in the plane - wave born approximation .",
    "these parameters are not discussed in the present paper but they are freely available from the database adamant ( http://www.adamant.tfai.vu.lt/database ) .    apart from our own computer codes developed specifically for the calculation of spectroscopic parameters and electron - impact excitation cross - sections in the qr approximation , we adapt the codes from the mchf package @xcite for use of the quasi - relativistic radial orbitals .",
    "level energies obtained in the qr approximation are listed in table  [ table_a ] for all 34 levels of the 3d@xmath1 configuration of fe  v , and agreement with the corresponding experimental data of nist is highly satisfactory .",
    "the ordering of the levels is also the same in both theory and measurements .",
    "generally , our calculated energies are slightly higher , but the discrepancies for most of the levels are less than @xmath49 , except for seven which deviate by up to @xmath50 .",
    "the largest relative discrepancy of @xmath51 is for level 23 ( @xmath52 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the highest level @xmath53 of the ground configuration 3d@xmath1 shows the largest absolute discrepancy of @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the averaged relative disagreement for the levels of the 3d@xmath1 configuration is only @xmath55 .",
    "more importantly , agreement between our calculations and the nist compilations is much better ( within 0.5% ) for levels of the 3d@xmath24s and 3d@xmath24p configurations ",
    "see table  [ ene - fe5 ] in which energies for all 182 levels of fe  v are listed .",
    "the averaged relative discrepancy for the excited configuration levels is only @xmath56 , and is @xmath57 for levels of the even - parity configuration 3d@xmath24s and @xmath58 for the odd - parity 3d@xmath24p .",
    "this good agreement for a larger number of levels is highly satisfactory and encouraging .",
    "however , we note that the @xmath59 designations listed in the table are not always definitive , because we have performed just a formal identification based on the maximum percentage contribution of a particular csf in the ci wavefunction expansion , and some levels are highly affected by csf mixing . for this reason their description using just a simple @xmath59 notation",
    "is not definitive in all cases , and other , more sophisticated level identification schemes have to be applied instead of an @xmath45 designation .",
    "all such levels are shown by a superscript  a \"  see e.g. , levels 83 , 87 , 89 , and 104 in table  [ ene - fe5 ] . however",
    ", this is a rather general atomic structure problem , as also noted in our earlier papers @xcite .    in table",
    "[ ene - co6 ] we compare our calculated energies with the nist compilations for all 182 levels of co  vi . as for fe  v , measurements are available for most levels , and discrepancies with these are slightly lower . the averaged relative discrepancy for the ground configuration is @xmath60 .",
    "similar to fe  v , the largest relative disagreement is for level @xmath52 .",
    "the averaged relative discrepancy for the excited configurations is only @xmath57 , with @xmath56 for the 3d@xmath24s configuration and only @xmath61 for 3d@xmath24p .    unfortunately , as it has been stated in section  [ intro ]",
    ", the number of levels for which measurements are available is very limited for ni  vii .",
    "therefore it is not used to calculate and compare the averaged relative discrepancies .",
    "nevertheless , in table  [ ene - ni7 ] we list our calculated energies for all the 182 levels of ni  vii along with those of nist .",
    "the differences between the theoretical and experimental energies are smaller that @xmath62 , excluding level 2 where it is 1.4% ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the discrepancies are no greater than @xmath64 , and below @xmath65 for common levels of the 3d@xmath24p configuration .",
    "therefore , for all three ti - like ions fe  v , co  vi and ni  vii there are no significant discrepancies for energy levels between theory and measurements , and therefore our results listed in tables  [ ene - fe5],[ene - co6],[ene - ni7 ] can be confidently applied to the modelling of plasmas",
    ".    for all three ions investigated the qr calculations are performed in the same approximation .",
    "consequently , a comparison of the discrepancies for specific level energies in fe  v and co  vi enables us to draw conclusions about the accuracy of the theoretical energies for those ni  vii levels which have no experimental data .    finally , we note that data in the tables  [ ene - fe5],[ene - co6],[ene - ni7 ] are provided for only the lowest 182 levels of the 3d@xmath1 , 3d@xmath24s and 3d@xmath24p configurations .",
    "inclusion of similar results for levels of the 3d@xmath24d or 3d@xmath24f configurations is not feasible , because these cover a much wider energy range ( and number over 1000 ) and intermix with many levels from other configurations ( such as 3p@xmath373d@xmath37 and 3d@xmath25@xmath23 ) , whereas there is no such intermixing among the lowest 182 .",
    "also listed in tables  [ ene - fe5],[ene - co6],[ene - ni7 ] are the land @xmath0-factors ( dimensionless ) that show the splitting of energy levels in a magnetic field , and represent the zeeman effect for a particular @xmath59 level .",
    "it is given by @xmath66 where the sum is over all csfs for that level , @xmath41 is the configuration , @xmath59 are total moments of the level , and @xmath67 is a weight ( a square of the expansion coefficient ) of a particular csf for the level eigen - function . sometimes measurement of @xmath0 are available and hence may help in assessing the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "unfortunately , for the ions considered here no experimental results are available with which to compare our data , but omalley et al .",
    "@xcite have reported @xmath0-factors for 19 ( @xmath13 ) levels of the 3d@xmath24p configuration of fe  v calculated in the relativistic configuration interaction ( rci ) approximation .",
    "therefore , in table  [ table_c ] we have included their and our @xmath0-factors for ready comparison . for most levels there are no discrepancies between the two independent calculations , but our results are lower by @xmath68 for two , namely 89 ( @xmath37f@xmath69 ) and 138 ( @xmath2d@xmath69 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-factors are sensitive to primarily those levels which have low @xmath45-purity , and hence the differences between the two calculations .",
    "apart from spectral modelling ( including diagnostics ) and the determination of the total radiative lifetimes ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath3-values are required for calculations of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) in stellar opacities , and radiative levitation and acceleration of heavy elements  see for example , @xcite and references therein . for this reason , nahar and",
    "pradhan @xcite performed very large calculations of energy levels and e1 @xmath3-values for transitions in fe  v , as already stated in section  [ intro ] .",
    "however , for more sophisticated modelling applications , and particularly the determination of @xmath48 , corresponding results for the electric quadrupole e2 , magnetic dipole m1 , and magnetic quadrupole m2 transitions are also desirable .",
    "therefore , in a separate paper @xcite they reported @xmath3-values for the m1 and e2 transitions of fe v.    in tables  [ tran - fe5],[tran - co6],[tran - ni7 ] we list transition energies ( @xmath70 , @xmath10 ) , wavelengths ( @xmath71 ,  ) , emission radiative rates ( @xmath3-values , s@xmath72 ) , weighted oscillator strengths ( @xmath73 , dimensionless ) , and transition line strengths ( @xmath39-values in atomic units ) for the e1 , e2 and m1 transitions of fe  v , cu  vi and ni  vii , respectively .",
    "these results are among the 182 levels listed in tables  [ ene - fe5],[ene - co6],[ene - ni7 ] , but we only include those transitions with @xmath3-values ( and other parameters ) which are @xmath74 of the largest value for an emission transition probability from the upper level @xmath75 . hence to save on space data for very weak transitions are not provided , as their impact on plasma modelling should be insignificant . for the same reason , @xmath3-values for the m2 and e3 transitions are also not included in tables  [ tran - fe5],[tran - co6],[tran - ni7 ] .",
    "however , @xmath3-values ( and other related parameters ) for all ( including much weaker ) transitions , along with electron - impact excitation data determined in the plane - wave born approximation , are freely available in ascii format from the adamant database at vilnius university ( http://www.adamant.tfai.vu.lt/database ) .",

    "there are no available theoretical or experimental @xmath48 data for comparison purposes , but there are no appreciable disagreements with previous theoretical results of @xmath0 , available for only a few levels .",
    "radiative rates for the three ions have also been reported for all e1 , e2 and m1 emission transitions .",
    "earlier data for the e1 transitions are available for fe  v by @xcite .",
    "however , in comparison to our calculations and those of others @xcite , their @xmath3-values appear to be less accurate , and so are their energy levels which differ from the measurements and our work by some @xmath97 for many levels",
    ". unfortunately , no such data are available for transitions in co  vi and ni  vii . among other types , @xmath3-values for the m1 and e2 transitions are also available @xcite , but only among the levels of the 3d@xmath1 and 3d@xmath24s configuration of fe  v. the m1 transitions are comparatively stronger than e2 , and there are no discrepancies between the present and the earlier results for any type of radiative transition . however , the present data cover the full range of all types of transitions among the lowest 182 levels .",
    "we believe our present data will be useful not only for the modelling of plasmas but also for further accuracy assessments .",
