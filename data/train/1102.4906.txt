    "from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observation , the relic abundance of the cold dark matter in the universe is determined to be @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scaled current hubble parameter in units of @xmath7 .",
    "since the standard model ( sm ) can not accommodate dark matter , new physics is expected . in this paper , we study dark matter in a model containing an @xmath0 triplet scalar with the hypercharge y=0 or 2 under @xmath8 , which is clearly one of the minimal extensions of the sm . in the model , the triplet is odd under an @xmath1 symmetry so that it neither directly couples to the sm fermions nor develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev )",
    ". we will refer to the model as the inert triplet model ( itm ) .",
    "since the neutral component of the triplet scalar can be the lightest one and stable in both y=0 and 2 cases , it is a good dark matter candidate . it can be shown that there are three and five new parameters in the y=0 and 2 itms , which are the same as those in the inert singlet and doublet models @xcite , respectively .",
    "clearly , the y=0 itm is one of the minimal inert models .    besides the relic abundance",
    ", the direct searches of dark matter also provide constraints on new physics models .",
    "for the spin - independent ( si ) cross section , one has that @xmath9 for the range of the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) mass smaller than @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "note that if the dark matter mass is larger , the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dd_constraint ] ) will be relaxed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : y=0 ] , we introduce the itm of the y=0 case and discuss the relic abundance as well as the direct detection of dark matter .",
    "we extend our study to the y=2 itm in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmy=2 ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in addition to the sm particles , we introduce an @xmath0 triplet scalar with y=0 and impose an @xmath1 symmetry in which the triplet is assigned to be odd and the others even .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the triplet scalar does not develop the vev to keep the @xmath1 symmetry unbroken .",
    "the relevant lagrangian is given by @xmath11 + \\lambda_1 |h^\\dag h|^2      \\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\lambda_2 \\left({{\\rm tr}}[t^2]\\right)^2 + \\lambda_3 h^\\dag h\\ { { \\rm tr}}[t^2 ] \\label{eq:3vertex},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the covariant derivative and the doublet @xmath13 and triplet @xmath14 scalars are defined as @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . in order to assure the stability of the potential , we require the conditions @xmath18 the potential in eq .",

    "after @xmath21 acquires the vev , the scalars gain the following masses : @xmath22 note that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the massless nambu - goldstone bosons eaten by the sm gauge fields .",
    "although the masses of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are degenerate at the tree level , a small mass splitting @xmath27 will appear once the radiative corrections @xcite are taken into account .",
    "hence , @xmath28 turns out to be the lightest component of the triplet scalar and moreover , it is stable due to @xmath1 .",
    "since the triplet scalar is added to the sm , one may think that it affects the so - called oblique ( s and t ) parameters .",
    "in general , however , an y=0 triplet has no contribution to the s parameter , while the contribution to the t parameter is also vanishing in the limit of @xmath29 @xcite . even if we consider the mass splitting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) , its effect is negligibly small .",
    "therefore , the constraint on the higgs boson mass ( @xmath30 ) from the precision electroweak measurements is the same as that in the sm . in our calculation",
    ", we restrict @xmath30 to be within the range of @xmath31 as estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite with the excluded region of @xmath32 reported by the tevatron @xcite .",
    "since the decay widths of @xmath4 and @xmath33 precisely measured by the lep and tevatron , agree well with the sm predictions , the new decay processes @xmath34 and @xmath35 must be strongly suppressed . to this end",
    ", we impose the following condition : @xmath36      we now examine the thermal relic abundance of @xmath25 .",
    "the evolution of the number density of @xmath25 is obtained by solving the boltzmann equation @xmath37 where @xmath13 is the hubble parameter , @xmath38 stands for relative velocity of @xmath28 , @xmath39 represents the thermal average of a function in brackets , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the number density , the number density in thermal equilibrium and the total annihilation cross section of @xmath25 , respectively . in the model ,",
    "since the mass splitting between dark matter ( @xmath28 ) and charged components ( @xmath26 ) is much smaller than their masses , the coannihilation effects of @xmath43 and @xmath44 should be included in @xmath42  @xcite .     with the vertical axis of @xmath45 $ ] , where black , gray , and white regions show the parameter regions larger than , agreed with , and smaller than the wmap constraint , respectively , while the straight line indicates the lep bound for @xmath25.,width=188 ]    in fig .",

    "micromegas2.4__@xcite to scan the parameter @xmath46 from @xmath47 to @xmath48 . for small couplings , i.e. @xmath49",
    ", the dark matter annihilation is governed by the weak interaction .",
    "so the annihilation cross section does not decrease so much . in this case , the main ( co)annihilation modes are @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . on the other hand , in the large coupling region ( i.e. @xmath53 ) , the main annihilation modes are @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "although some of those annihilation are mediated by the higgs @xmath21 , the relic abundance is not subject to @xmath30 so much as long as we take @xmath56 . since the trilinear coupling of @xmath21 involves only @xmath57 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:3vertex ] ) ) , the cross sections are enhanced .",
    "note that the relic abundance depends on only @xmath58 , whereas both @xmath59 and @xmath60 are irrelevant to the annihilation interactions . from the figure",

    "we remark that @xmath62 is allowed if there are some other dark matter sources .       and nucleus particles , where numbers on lines represent the cross sections in @xmath63 unit , while light gray and dark gray regions are allowed by direct searches of dark matter . , width=188 ]",
    "the si cross section of the y=0 itm is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : direct_detection ] . > from the figure , we can see that in most of the region , the model escapes the constraint from the direct search .",
    "we note that the contribution of the si cross section is insensitive to @xmath30 as long as @xmath64 even though it comes from the @xmath25-quark and @xmath25-gluon collisions through the @xmath65 coupling .",
    "since the @xmath25-quark ( u , d ) scattering has a small cross section due to the small yukawa couplings , while @xmath25-gluon scattering occurs only in loop level , the si cross section is clearly suppressed .",

    "the total relic abundance of @xmath69 and @xmath70 is shown and @xmath70 are the same , which simplifies our calculation to the relic abundance of @xmath69 only .",
    "it is justified since the interactions of @xmath69 and @xmath70 are almost the same . ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : relic_abundance2 ] .",
    "note that the masses of @xmath26 and @xmath72 are automatically fixed if @xmath73 and @xmath74 are known .",
    "it is easy to see that the relic abundance tends to be large compared to that in the y=0 case .",
    "moreover , the mass splitting among the triplet scalars is not so small unless the absolute value of @xmath75 is enormously small",
    ". since coannihilations of the triplet scalars are not so effective , the relic abundance gets enhanced . however , in the small @xmath74 region ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) , the masses of @xmath69 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are still degenerate . as the result",
    ", the coannihilation involving @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( e.g. , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) is active . in the large @xmath75 region , as the mass degeneracy of the triplet components is lifted , the coannihilation effect becomes weaker , which enhances the relic abundance .",
    "however , the annihilation cross section becomes large due to the large couplings of @xmath81 and @xmath75 , which suppresses the relic abundance more effective than the coannihilation effect .",
    "region with @xmath82 , where the light gray region is allowed by wmap . ]    in the region with @xmath83  gev , the relic abundance drastically changes due to the resonance effect as well as the opening of new annihilation final states .",
    "we show the relic abundance in the small mass region in fig .",
    "[ fig : relic_abundance100 ] . in the figure , we have fixed @xmath84 . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the relic abundance tends to be small due to the large coupling .",
    "the main annihilation mode is @xmath86 , while @xmath87 is also effective if @xmath88 is large . for @xmath89 , we find that the relic abundance suddenly decreases at @xmath90  gev and @xmath91  gev due to @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath94 , the main interaction mode at the large @xmath88 region is @xmath95 since the gauge interaction is more effective than the higgs interaction . in this case",
    ", the relic abundance becomes much smaller . for a smaller @xmath75 ( i.e. @xmath96 ) ,",
    "the figure is similar to that for the case of @xmath85 as the relic abundance is small due to the large coannihilation cross section of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we note that for @xmath100 , the figures are similar to those with @xmath101 and @xmath102 since the main interactions enhanced by the large higgs coupling are proportional to @xmath103 .    in the region with @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is most effective , the relic abundance is reduced . in the case of @xmath106 ,",
    "the tri - higgs couplings proportional to @xmath103 are canceled to be @xmath107 .",
    "since the effective couplings of the higgs bosons are very weak , the relic abundance is determined by gauge interactions .",
    "we comment on the direct detection of the y=2 case . unlike y=0",
    ", there are three scattering processes in the y=2 model .",
    "two of them are the same as those in the y=0 case , while the other one is the @xmath25-quark scattering through the gauge coupling of @xmath25 to @xmath4 as shown explicitly in appendix .",
    "the latter has a larger cross section due to the gauge coupling . because of this large cross section , almost all region",
    "is excluded by the direct detection constraint in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dd_constraint ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have checked that in all of the regions allowed by lep experiments , the si cross section is larger than about @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , even if the ratio of @xmath81 and @xmath74 ( i.e. , the coupling of dm - gluon scattering ) is changed , the cross section is still larger than the constraint from the direct detection .",
    "we have studied dark matter in the two inert triplet models . in the y=0 model , we have shown that the favored region by the wmap result is around @xmath109 based on the relic abundance .",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath25 scatters quarks only for the small yukawa couplings as it does not couple to @xmath4 at the lagrangian level , while the @xmath25-gluon scattering occurs at loop level , dark matter ( @xmath25 ) in most of the regions , including that favored by wmap , is allowed from the direct detection . for the y=2 case , @xmath110 is preferred in terms of the relic abundance of @xmath25 .",
    "however , since the @xmath25-quark scattering is allowed at tree level due to the @xmath111 coupling , which enhances the scattering cross section , most of the regions is excluded by the direct detection . +   + * acknowledgement * we are grateful to g.  b@xmath112langer and a.  pukhov for their kind help for _ micromegas_. the work of t.a . was supported in part by the national natural science foundation of china under grant no .",
