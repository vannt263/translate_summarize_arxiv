    "rtws with power law distributed run lengths  have been repeatedly invoked as optimal foraging strategies @xcite .",
    "this optimality however holds only in the particular case where the targets are distributed in space according to a poisson law , and are in addition assumed to regenerate at the same location after a finite time . in the opposite case of destructive search , where each target can be found only once , the search is optimized by the trivial ballistic excursion .",
    "these restrictive conditions have weakened the robustness of lvy strategies and made their applicability to field data rather disputed over the years @xcite . in this context , assessing the search efficiency of general rtws  and in particular lvy walks  in the basic setting of a single target in a finite domain appears as a very important issue that has remained unsettled so far : this is the goal of this article .    from a technical point of view , a natural observable to quantify the search efficiency is the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) to a target . in the case of a single target in the interior of a bounded domain  or equivalently regularly spaced targets in infinite space  , the full fpt statistics , and in particular its mean , have been derived asymptotically for markovian scale invariant random walks @xcite ( see also @xcite for an extension to non - markovian processes ) .",
    "these results have been be extended to the narrow - escape case , in which the target is embedded in the boundary of the confining domain @xcite .",

    "more recently , the mfpt for lattice persistent random walks has been studied in ref .",
    "this however does not solve the case of rtws , which can not be defined as a continuous limit of lattice walks  a striking difference being that the mfpt for lattice walks can be controlled by infinitely long periodic orbits @xcite , which do not exist for general domain shapes or boundary conditions in continuous space .",
