    "random walks are widely used in physics so as to model the features of transport processes where the migrating ( possibly massless ) particle undergoes a series of random displacements as the effect of repeated collisions with the surrounding environment  @xcite .",
    "while much attention has been given to random walks on regular euclidean lattices , and to the corresponding scaling limits , less has been comparatively devoted to the case where the direction of propagation can change continuously at each collision : for an historical review , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "such processes , which are intimately connected to the boltzmann equation , have been named _ random flights _ , and play a prominent role in the description of , among others , neutron or photon propagation through matter  @xcite , chemical and biological species migration  @xcite , or electron motion in semiconductors  @xcite .    within the simplest formulation of this model , which was originally proposed by pearson ( 1905 )  @xcite and later extended by kluyver ( 1906 )  @xcite and rayleigh ( 1919 )  @xcite , it is assumed that particles perform random displacements ( ` flights ' ) along straight lines , and that at the end of each flight ( a ` collision ' with the surrounding medium ) the direction of propagation changes at random .",
    "when the number of transported particles is much smaller than the number of the particles of the interacting medium , so that inter - particles collisions can be safely neglected , it is reasonable to assume that the probability of interacting with the medium is poissonian . for the case of neutrons in a nuclear reactor ,",
    "e.g. , the ratio between the number of transported particles and the number of interacting nuclei in a typical fuel@xmath2moderator configuration is of the order of @xmath3 , even for high flux reactors  @xcite .",
    "it follows that flight lengths between subsequent collisions are exponentially distributed ( hence we will call this process _ exponential flights _ in the following  ) .",
    "we assume that collisions can be either of scattering or absorption type . at each scattering collision , the flight direction changes at random , whereas at absorption events the particle disappears and the flight terminates .",
    "each flight can be seen as a random walk in the phase space of position @xmath4 and direction @xmath5 in a @xmath0-dimensional setup .",
    "the particle density @xmath6 represents the probability density of finding a transported particle at position @xmath4 having direction @xmath5 at a time @xmath7 , up to an appropriate normalization factor . in many applications ,",
    "the actual physical observable is the average of the density @xmath6 over the directions @xmath5 , namely @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a normalization factor corresponding to the surface of the unit @xmath0-dimensional sphere and @xmath10 is the gamma function  @xcite .",
    "along with the development of monte carlo methods , numerical solutions @xmath11 to complex three - dimensional linear / nonlinear transport problems coming from applied sciences are becoming accessible to an high degree of accuracy : criticality calculations in reactor cores  @xcite , scattering and absorption in heated plasmas  @xcite , propagation through anisotropic scattering centers in atmosphere or fluids  @xcite , and charge transport in semiconductors under external fields  @xcite , only to name a few .",
    "nonetheless , even for the simplest systems , many theoretical questions remain without an answer , so that the study of exponential flights has attracted a renovated interest in recent years ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite . in particular , it has been emphasized that the dimension @xmath0 deeply affects the nature of @xmath11 , and prevents in most cases from obtaining explicit results . the aim of our work is to investigate exponential flights in a generic @xmath0-dimensional setup , under simplifying hypotheses . here",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "within the natural framework of statistical mechanics , the evolution of the particle density @xmath6 for exponential flights is governed by the linear boltzmann equation  @xcite .",
    "linearity stems from neglecting inter - particle collisions . in the hypothesis that an average particle energy can be defined ( the so called one - speed transport ) , and that the physical properties of the medium do not depend on position nor time , the boltzmann equation for the density @xmath6 reads  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is total cross section of the traversed medium ( carrying the units of an inverse length ) , @xmath16 is the scattering cross section , @xmath17 is the particle speed , and @xmath18 is the source .",
    "the total cross section @xmath15 is such that @xmath19 represents the average flight length between consecutive collisions ( the so - called mean free path ) , and is related to the scattering cross section @xmath16 and to the absorption cross section @xmath20 by @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is the scattering kernel , i.e. , the probability density that at each scattering collision the random direction changes from @xmath23 to @xmath5 .",
    "= 9.0 cm    denoting by @xmath6 the solution of the boltzmann equation   for a medium without absorptions ( @xmath24 ) , the complete solution with absorption @xmath25 can be easily obtained by letting @xmath26 thanks to linearity  @xcite .",
    "this allows primarily addressing a purely scattering medium ( @xmath27 ) , without loss of generality .    at long times , i.e.",
    ", far from the source , the direction - averaged particle density @xmath11 is known to converge to a gaussian shape , namely , @xmath28 the quantity @xmath29 playing the role of a diffusion coefficient  @xcite . however , eq .   is approximately valid for @xmath30 , and can not capture the particle evolution at early times , nor the finite - speed propagation effects . indeed , diffusion implicitly assumes a non - vanishing probability of finding the particles at arbitrary distance from the source .",
    "deviations from the limit gaussian behavior are well known , e.g. , for neutron  @xcite as well electron transport  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we outline the relation between @xmath11 and the underlying exponential flight process .",
    "consider a @xmath0-dimensional setup .",
    "a particle , originally located at position @xmath31 in a given domain , travels along straight lines at constant speed @xmath17 , until it collides with the medium .",
    "the position of a particle at the @xmath32-th collision can be expressed as a random walk @xmath33 , i.e. , a sum of random variables @xmath34 .",
    "the flight lengths @xmath35 are assumedly identically distributed and obey an exponential probability density @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the exponential law in eq .   stems from assuming a uniform distribution of the scattering centers in the traversed medium .",
    "heterogeneous materials , such as complex fluids , would generally lead to clustered scattering centers , obeying to , e.g. , negative binomial distributions , and in turn to non - exponential flight lengths  @xcite .",
    "however , we will focus our attention on homogeneous media .    at each collision , the particle randomly changes its direction according to the scattering kernel @xmath22 . for the sake of simplicity , we assume here that the scattering is isotropic , so that @xmath22 has a uniform distribution , independent of the incident direction @xmath23 .",
    "once a flight length has been sampled from @xmath38 , the new direction @xmath5 is therefore uniformly distributed on the @xmath0-sphere of surface @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , by virtue of the apparent spherical symmetry , the transition kernel , i.e. , the probability density of performing a displacement from @xmath40 to @xmath34 , depends only on @xmath35 , and reads @xmath41    we initially neglect absorptions , so that @xmath42 : in one - speed transport , this condition can be either seen as the particles been scattered , or equivalently being absorbed and then re - emitted ( with the same speed ) at each collision .",
    "this latter interpretation would correspond , e.g. , to a _ criticality _",
    "condition in multiplicative systems for neutron transport .",
    "we define then the free propagator @xmath43 as the probability density of finding a particle at position @xmath4 at the @xmath32-th collision , for an infinite medium , i.e. , in absence of boundaries .",
    "we adopt here the convention that the particle position and direction refer to the physical properties before entering the collision ; for instance , the index @xmath44 refers to uncollided particles , i.e. , particles coming from the source and entering their first collision .    assuming that all the particles are isotropically emitted at @xmath45 , the particle density @xmath43 must depend only on the variable @xmath46 , because of the spherical symmetry . on the basis of the properties exposed above",
    ", the particle propagation as a function of the number of collisions is a markovian process in the variable @xmath47 , where for each collision @xmath48 the new propagator is given by the convolution integral @xmath49 with initial condition @xmath50 .",

    "the link between the travelled distance , the flight time and the number of collisions is provided by the speed @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , once a flight of length @xmath96 between any two collisions has been sampled from @xmath38 , the flight time must satisfy @xmath97 .",

    "several boundary conditions can be conceived according to the specific physical system , among which the most common are reflecting and leakage .",
    "this issue has been extensively examined , e.g. , for radiation shielding in reactor physics  @xcite and for electron motion in semiconductors  @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on leakage boundary conditions , where particles are considered lost as soon as their trajectory has traversed the outer boundary @xmath139 of the domain .",
    "while the volume @xmath138 is in principle totally arbitrary , in the subsequent calculations for the sake of convenience we will assume that @xmath140 is a sphere of radius @xmath141 centered in @xmath142 .",
    "from the point of view of the propagator , leakages can be taken into account by assuming that the population density @xmath73 at any @xmath32 vanishes at the so - called extrapolation length @xmath143 , i.e. , @xmath144  @xcite .",
    "because trajectory do not terminate at the boundary , but rather at the first collision occurred outside the volume , the extrapolation length is expected to be larger than the physical boundary of @xmath145 and can be determined from solving the so - called milne s problem associated to the volume  @xcite . in general , @xmath143 is of the kind @xmath146 $ ] , the dimensionless constant @xmath147 depending on the dimension of the system  @xcite .",

    "this means that the inter - collision length is so small as compared to the total travelled distance that the first collision outside the domain will actually be very close to the last collision inside the domain , which corresponds to @xmath73 vanishing at @xmath141  @xcite .",

    "a remarkable feature is that in either case the spread does not explicitly depend on the dimension @xmath0 .",
    "intuitively , this can be understood by considering that ( independently of the dimension @xmath0 of the embedding setup ) the vectors @xmath169 and @xmath170 define a plane with random orientation , so that space is explored by plane surfaces at each collision .",
