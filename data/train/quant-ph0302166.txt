    "brillouin and sommerfeld showed that in the region of anomalous dispersion , which is inside of the absorption band , the group velocity can exceed @xmath0 , the light speed in a vacuum , or even be negative @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that for a gain medium , superluminal propagation is possible at the outside of the gain resonance .",
    "superluminal effects are also predicted in terms of quantum tunneling or evanescent waves @xcite .",
    "superluminal group velocities have been confirmed experimentally in various systems , and most controversies over this counterintuitive phenomenon have settled down . however , there seem a several questions remain open ; for example , `` how far we can speed up the wave packets , '' `` is it really nothing to do with information transmission , '' `` what kind of applications are possible , '' and so on . in this paper",
    "we will try to solve some of these problems by utilizing a simple circuit model for negative group delays .",
    "negative delay in lumped systems such as electronic circuits is very helpful to understand various aspects of superluminal group velocity .",
    "mitchell and chiao @xcite constructed a bandpass amplifier with an @xmath1 resonator and an operational amplifier .",
    "an arbitrary waveform generator is used to generate a gaussian pulse by which a carrier is modulated .",
    "the circuit basically emulates an optical gain medium which shows anomalous dispersion in off - resonant region .",
    "_ @xcite extended this circuit by using two @xmath1 resonators which correspond to the two raman gain lines @xcite . at the middle of two gain peaks the frequency dependence of amplitude response",
    "is compensated and the pulse distortion can be minimized .",
    "the present authors @xcite used an operational amplifier with an @xmath2 feedback circuit .",
    "it provides negative delays for baseband pulses . in previous experiments , optical or electronic , a carrier frequency ( @xmath3 )",
    "is modulated by a pulse which varies slowly compared with the carrier oscillation and the displacement of the envelopes is measured . without carriers ( @xmath4 ) , the system becomes much more simple .",
    "the amplitude response symmetric with respect to zero frequency is helpful to reduce the distortion .",
    "the baseband pulse is simply derived from a rectangular pulse generator and a series of lowpass filters .",
    "the time constants can easily be set at the order of seconds and we can actually observe that the output led ( light - emitting diode ) is lit earlier than the input led .",
    "in addition to the usefulness as a demonstration tool , this circuit turned out to be very convenient to look into the essentials of negative group delays and superluminal propagation because of its simplicity .    in this paper",
    "we exploit the circuit model in order to investigate some of the fundamental problems .",
    "first we discuss the relation between negative group delay and superluminarity , and then the approximate realization of ( positive and negative ) delays by lumped systems .",
    "then we consider the spectral condition imposed on input pulses and describe the design of lowpass filters for pulse preparation .",
    "next in order to increase the advancement , a number of negative delay circuits are cascaded .",
    "we find that an advancement as large as the pulse width is possible but the slow increase of the advancement and the exponential increase of out - of - band gain almost prohibit the achievement of further advancements . finally by regarding our system as a communication channel",
    ", we discuss the causality in lumped systems .",
    "the group velocity @xmath5 in a dispersive medium is defined as @xmath6 where the wavenumber @xmath7 is a function of frequency @xmath8 .",
    "it corresponds to the propagation speed of an envelope of signal whose spectrum is limited within a short interval containing @xmath3 .",
    "similarly the group delay is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the frequency - dependent phase shift .",
    "it corresponds to the temporal shift of the envelope of the band - limited signal passing through a system . for a medium with length @xmath11 ,",
    "the phase shift is given by @xmath12 and we have @xmath13    these two quantities seem almost identical , but the group delay is a more general concept because it can be defined even for a lumped system . the lumped system is a system whose size @xmath11 is much smaller than the wavelength @xmath14 of interest . neglecting the propagation effects , the behavior of the system can be described by a set of ordinary differential equations with respect to time . for distributed systems , on the other hand ,",
    "the spatio - temporal partial differential equation must be used .",
    "the relation between negative group delays and superluminality can easily be understood when we consider a system consisting with a vacuum path ( length @xmath11 ) and a lumped system ( delay @xmath15 ) which is located at the end of the path .",
    "the total time @xmath16 required for a pulse to pass through the system is @xmath17 the corresponding velocity @xmath18 satisfies the relation : @xmath19 for @xmath20 ( positive delay ) , @xmath5 is smaller than @xmath0 . for @xmath21 ( negative delay )",
    ", there are two cases . in the case",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath5 is larger than @xmath0 ( superluminal in a narrow sense ) , while in the case @xmath23 , @xmath5 becomes negative ( negative group velocity ) . in the latter case",
    "the contribution of the lumped part dominates that of the free propagation path .    normally the superluminality has been considered as a propagation effect .",
    "but in many cases , it seems more appropriate to discuss in term of the negative group delay for a lumped system .",
    "let us take experimental parameters from @xcite , in which the negative delay of @xmath24 was observed .",
    "we note that the pulse length @xmath25 is much longer than the cell length @xmath26 .",
    "therefore we can safely use the lumped approximation . since we can eliminate the carrier frequency by the slowly - varying envelope approximation",

    "( [ eq : ttotal ] ) or ( [ eq : vgdecom ] ) , which is positive or negative , dominates the first term are very likely . for typical atomic experiments , the bandwidth @xmath28 , which is of the order of mhz to ghz , roughly determines advancement as @xmath29 , @xmath30 to @xmath31 , while the passage time @xmath32 is less than the order of@xmath31 .",
    "forcible assignment of a velocity to such cases , @xmath33 in the above example , would have caused some confusions .",
    "a mathematical representation for ideal delays can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the impulse response of the system and @xmath15 is the delay time .",
    "its fourier transform is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37    for @xmath20 ( positive delay ) , the impulse response @xmath38 is causal , i.e. , it is zero for @xmath39 .",
    "the positive delay can be realized easily , if you have an appropriate space ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "but there is no way to make ideal , unconditional negative delays , because @xmath38 is non - causal in this case .",
    "it should be noted that no lumped systems ( @xmath41 ) can produce ideal positive or negative delays . from now on let us consider how to make approximate delays with lumped systems .",
    "the amplitude and the phase of the ideal response function @xmath42 are @xmath43 in @xcite , we used a circuit having a transfer function @xmath44 by which negative delay is provided for baseband pulses ( @xmath4 ) . here",
    "we will examine several transfer functions which can be realized with an operational amplifier and a few passive components .",
    "first , we consider a function with a single pole : @xmath45 the stability condition that all the poles reside in the upper half plane requires @xmath46 , therefore , only positive delays @xmath47 can be achieved with this type of transfer function .",

    "secondly , we will check a function with a single zero : @xmath49 in this case , no sign restrictions are imposed on @xmath50 , therefore , both positive and negative delays can be realized ; @xmath51 . a circuit for @xmath52 ( @xmath46 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : elementary_cir](b ) .",
    "perhaps this is the most simple circuit which provides negative delay .",
    "again it works only in the region @xmath48 .",
    "even worse is the rising of gain @xmath53 at the outside of the band .",
    "we can also construct a positive delay circuit utilizing the relation @xmath54 .    by observing the sign restrictions for @xmath55 and @xmath52",

    "this circuit is called the all - pass filter .",
    "the phase function is the same as the above cases aside from the factor 2 , but the amplitude response in independent of the frequency as in the case of ideal delay .",
    "the stability condition implies @xmath46 , therefore , only positive delays are possible .",
    "it turned out that lumped circuits can provide a delay , positive or negative , only for a band - limited signal . from the approximate transfer function , @xmath57 ,",
