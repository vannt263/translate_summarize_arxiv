    "the evidence for the existence of a dark sector in the universe has made the present era of cosmology fascinating and challenging . at present , the microscopic natures of dark energy and dark matter are still an open question , with both components only probed gravitationally @xcite . regarding dark matter , there are various particle physics candidates which may belong to the class of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) or which may interact only gravitationally . on the other hand , for particle physics explanations of the observed dark energy ,",
    "the main fundamental question is whether dark energy is a cosmological constant or a dynamical field . while in the former case",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath3 of dark energy is constant and equal to @xmath1 , in the latter case it is a function of redshift @xmath4 and in general differs from @xmath1 , providing a way to distinguish both fundamental types of dark energy experimentally .",
    "such a deviation of @xmath3 from @xmath1 will be searched for in various future surveys , studying supernovae , baryonic acoustic oscillations , weak gravitational lensing effects , galaxy clusters , or other techniques @xcite .",
    "one obstacle to relate dark energy more explicitly to particle physics is the fact that the amount of the observed energy density @xmath5 ev is _ much _ smaller than the `` theoretical expectation '' . in this paper",
    "we will not address this `` cosmological constant '' problem , i.e.  the suppression / cancellation of the various generic contributions to dark energy which are too large , but assume that it is resolved by some other mechanism .",
    "our work is motivated by the intriguing observation that the energy density of dark energy is close to another very small scale in particle physics , namely the one of neutrino masses .",
    "the discovery of flavour conversion of neutrinos from various sources , interpreted within the framework of neutrino oscillations , points to two mass eigenvalues of the light neutrinos above about @xmath6 ev and @xmath7 ev @xcite , while searches for neutrino masses from tritium @xmath8-decay and neutrinoless double @xmath8-decay yield an upper bound for each mass eigenvalue of roughly @xmath9 ev @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the scale of dark energy to that of neutrino masses has inspired the proposal of the so - called mass varying neutrino ( mavan ) scenario @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", the relic neutrino density contributes to the effective potential for the dynamical field which is called `` acceleron '' .",
    "one consequence is that neutrino masses vary on cosmological time scales and , since the relation between neutrino masses and @xmath10 remains valid in earlier cosmic epochs , also dark energy behaves differently from a cosmological constant .",
    "compared to other dynamical models of dark energy ( e.g.  quintessence @xcite ) , in the mavan scenario one does not have to choose a mass for the dynamical field of the order of the present hubble parameter @xmath11 .",
    "in fact it can be much larger , even of the order of the neutrino mass scale , due to the stabilising effect of the contribution of the relic neutrino density to the potential . as a result",
    ", the field adiabatically tracks the minimum of the effective potential whose evolution is controlled by the time evolution of neutrino number density .",
    "the mavan models have been investigated in many studies , e.g.  regarding possible experimental signatures and constraints @xcite as well as model - building issues @xcite .",
    "it has turned out that while there are many interesting possible signatures and attractive features , the scenario is tightly constrained by the requirement of consistency with late time structure formation . in particular , it has been pointed out @xcite that if neutrinos are non - relativistic today , due to fifth force effects the neutrinos would cluster at late time and finally form `` neutrino nuggets '' which would spoil the dark energy behavior of the neutrino fluid .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the phenomenology of a generalised scenario which we will refer to as mavan hybrid scenario , where in addition to a mavan sector a cosmological constant ( from a false vacuum ) is driving the accelerated expansion of the universe today . as we will show , for a generalised power law potential in the mavan sector the effective equation of state parameter @xmath0 as well as the fraction to which the dark energy is of dynamical nature is determined by the neutrino mass scale .",
    "we will also analyse the possibility to realise neutrino dark energy with a `` high - scale '' seesaw mechanism , where the right - handed neutrino masses are close to the gut scale , and comment on how such models might help to suppress the formation of `` neutrino nuggets '' and resolve stability problems of mavan models with non - relativistic neutrinos . for the main part of the paper we will focus on neutrinos that are non - relativistic today .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we will review the basics of the mavan scenario .",
    "section 3 contains the definition of the phenomenological framework and the analysis is performed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the possibility of realising neutrino dark energy with a `` high - scale '' seesaw mechanism and in section 6 we comment on how this might help to solve stability issues for non - relativistic neutrinos .",
    "section 7 contains our summary and conclusions .",
    "in the basic mavan scenario a singlet fermion @xmath12 ( right - handed neutrino ) and a dynamical real scalar field @xmath13 ( called `` acceleron '' ) are introduced .",
    "their dynamics gives rise to the acceleration of the universe and to neutrino masses which vary with time .",
    "the basic form of the lagrangian is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is neutrino dirac mass , @xmath16 is a dimensionless coupling in dark sector and @xmath17 is the potential energy of the acceleron field .",
    "the standard model neutrino @xmath18 as well as the singlet neutrino @xmath12 are both written as two - component left - chiral weyl spinor fields .",
    "if @xmath19 , i.e.  if the majorana mass of the right - handed neutrino is much larger than the neutrino dirac mass , one can effectively integrate out @xmath12 from the low energy theory which leads to the effective lagrangian @xmath20 the neutrino mass @xmath21 depends on the dynamics of @xmath13 .",
    "taking into account the masses of the non - relativistic relic neutrinos we now include a term proportional to the relic neutrino number density @xmath22 to the effective potential , @xmath23    the effective potential @xmath24 for the acceleron @xmath13 has a minimum because the first term pushes @xmath13 to larger values whereas as the second term @xmath17 is assumed to favour smaller values of @xmath13 ( e.g.if @xmath25 ) . typically , in this type of models a sub - ev scale is introduced in order to realize the desired values of @xmath17 ( and finally of @xmath26 ) . as a consequence of the two contributions to the potential and since @xmath27 decreases with time , the field value of the acceleron field @xmath13 becomes smaller with time when it adiabatically tracks the minima of the potential ( if the mass of @xmath13 is above the hubble parameter ) .",
    "the combined @xmath13 and neutrino fluid drives the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "we remark that unlike in conventional quintessence models the scalar field does not roll down an extremely flat potential but it rather gets stabilised by the finite neutrino density . for this reason",
    ", the slope of the potential can be much higher than in quintessence scenarios and the mass of the scalar field @xmath13 can even be as high as the neutrino mass scale , whereas in quintessence models it has to be as tiny as the hubble scale .",
    "although the model can successfully explain the present acceleration of the universe with masses of the dynamical scalar field much larger than the hubble scale ( e.g.  in the sub - ev range ) and provide a connection between dark energy and the physics of neutrino masses , it has also some shortcomings : for example , the potential is not stable under radiative corrections , unless new states appear with sub - ev masses , and it still has to be rather flat in order to be consistent with present constraints on the equation of state parameter .",
    "furthermore , the mavan scenario with non - relativistic neutrinos has a problem with respect to the consistency with late time structure formation , as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "if neutrinos are non - relativistic today , due to fifth force effects the neutrinos could cluster at late time and finally form `` neutrino nuggets '' which would spoil the dark energy behavior of the neutrino fluid .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that under certain conditions these problems might be overcome @xcite .",
    "for example , in supersymmetric theories of neutrino dark energy the potential can be stable under radiative corrections ( for example in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking where supersymmetry breaking is only transmitted to the dark sector via gravity such that the dark sector superpartners are light ) and stability problems with respect to neutrino density perturbations can be avoided if neutrinos are highly relativistic , although then the connection to neutrino masses is weakened since the two observed mass scales correspond to non - relativistic neutrinos .",
    "after having reviewed the basics of the original mavan scenario in the last section , we will now set up the framework for our analysis .",
    "it consists of a generalised mavan potential of power law type plus a constant vacuum energy contribution . in the following",
    "we will specify it explicitly and comment on how it may be realised in classes of models as well as on the connection to the ( in principle ) experimentally measurable neutrino mass scale .      in the following we will consider a rather general setup where neutrino dark energy is realised in a type of `` hybrid dark energy '' setup with the theory being in a false vacuum at present time .",
    "this implies that in addition to the time varying contribution of the acceleron field there is an additional contribution of the energy density of the false vacuum .",
    "motivated by the notion of providing a rather general framework for our study , we will therefore consider an effective potential for neutrino dark energy of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath13 is the acceleron field as a real scalar field as in section [ sec : scenarios ] , unless stated otherwise .",
    "] , @xmath30 is the energy density of the sm neutrinos today and @xmath31 is the scale factor .",
    "the main ingredients are a constant term @xmath32 ( from a false vacuum ) , a potential for @xmath13 which is monotonically increasing with @xmath33 ( in our case a general power law potential @xmath34 ) and an effective term @xmath35 , where we assume @xmath36 in order to generalise the conventional seesaw relation .",
    "we note that the potential of eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) is not the most general form of a potential that may arise in a realistic model . instead of the monomial potential that we are considering",
    ", it can for instance also be a polynomial or logarithmic function of the field @xmath13 , or a combination of both .      to motivate the appearance of the constant vacuum energy in the `` hybrid scenario '' by an example",
    ", we may consider the following superpotential ( after ew symmetry breaking ) , @xmath37 where hats indicate superfields .",
    "@xmath38 denotes the sm singlet ( right - handed neutrino ) superfield(s ) , and the most relevant contributions to the scalar potential stem from the f - terms @xmath39 .",
    "the first term contributes the constant vacuum energy while the second term gives a mass term ( @xmath40 ) to the acceleron field .",
    "together with the additional effective potential term @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the vev of the higgs field which couples to the neutrinos , the potential for the acceleron has a minimum for a non - zero field value of @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath43 also gives a time - varying mass to the right - handed neutrino , @xmath44 .    while the above superpotential may serve as a simple example which could realise the generalised potential of eq .",
    "( [ effective_potential ] ) with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , it should be kept in mind that that there is in principle a large variety of possible models which can give rise to other values of @xmath47 and @xmath8 ( as well as to other non - power - law forms of the potential ) . for example , different powers of @xmath13 may appear in the superpotential or the neutrino masses may originate from a different type of seesaw mechanism ( e.g.  from a so - called double @xcite or multiple seesaw ) such that @xmath48 , and so on .",
    "furthermore , one may anticipate that the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath8 in realistic values should be positive integers .",
    "however , it is also possible that fractional values of the exponents appear , for example if the kinetic terms in a model are non - canonical and therefore a field transformation has to be performed in order to bring the kinetic terms back to canonical form .",
    "we will discuss the possible origin of the generalised potential in more detail in the appendix .      from neutrino oscillation experiments ,",
    "two so - called mass squared differences are known : @xmath49 is known mainly from atmospheric neutrinos and @xmath50 from solar neutrino data and from the kamland experiment .",
    "the experimental values are about @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xcite . with this nomenclature",
    "we also know that @xmath53 , but @xmath54 can be the heaviest or the lightest of the mass eigenvalues .",
    "for the sum @xmath55 defined as @xmath56 we know that there is a lower bound from oscillations ( saturated if @xmath57 and @xmath58 ev , @xmath59 ev ) and also an upper bound from neutrinoless double @xmath8 experiments of about @xmath60 ev ( with @xmath61 ev ) @xcite . finally , we have approximately @xmath62 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the lightest of the neutrino mass eigenvalues ( @xmath63 or @xmath54 ) can be arbitrarily small .",
    "one important question is whether this sum @xmath55 is relevant for the mavan setup , or whether the mass of only one of the light neutrinos matters . to answer this question , we have to go to the full three family scenario where we distinguish two possible cases .    in one possible situation ( which we may call case i ) @xmath55 is indeed relevant .",
    "this case applies when the vev of the field @xmath13 gives masses to all the right - handed neutrinos @xmath64 such that the part of the lagrangian relevant for neutrino masses reads for instance ( @xmath65 is a coupling matrix ) @xmath66 the seesaw suppressed mass matrix of the light neutrinos is then given by @xmath67 if we diagonalise @xmath68 , the effective potential reads @xmath69 where we have assumed that @xmath70 for all generations @xmath47 of neutrinos .    on the other hand",
    ", we could have the situation ( which we may call case ii ) that each @xmath64 gets its mass from a different scalar field , e.g.  from the vevs of fields @xmath71 and @xmath72 and that we have a lagrangian of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 are coupling constants .",
    "now the light neutrino mass matrix would be given by @xmath75 in this example , only @xmath63 would be relevant for the effective potential for @xmath13 .. ] if consistency of the mavan scenario ( for a particular form of the potential ) would require a very light neutrino mass scale @xmath76 ev , this could be realised in case ii .",
    "the relevant mass would then be @xmath63 for a so - called normal hierarchical spectrum or @xmath54 for an inverted hierarchical spectrum .    in the following , we will mainly be interested in case i , since it has a particularly close link to the observed neutrino masses which manifests itself in the upper and lower experimental bounds on today s value of @xmath55 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mbar_range ] ) .",
    "we will therefore present our results using the notation for case i where the relevant neutrino mass scale is @xmath55 .",
    "most of the formulae can readily be adopted to case ii , as long as neutrinos remain non - relativistic .",
    "in this section we will investigate the dynamics and phenomenology of the mavan hybrid scenario with a general power law potential @xmath77 the observed small neutrino masses are generated by a version of the seesaw mechanism , and we will assume a general dependence of the neutrino masses on @xmath13 of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the vev of the sm higgs field ( which is proportional to the dirac masses of the neutrinos ) .",
    "the notation @xmath80 is introduced in section [ sec : connectiontomnu ] .      as a first step of our analysis we consider the background dynamics of the scalar field @xmath13 in the mavan hybrid scenario defined in section [ sec : mavanhybrid ] , which leads to an effective potential for @xmath13 of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 and where the index `` @xmath83 '' indicates todays values of the parameters .",
    "the second term in the potential originates from the coupling between neutrino and the scalar field in the effective lagrangian . in the following discussions ,",
    "if we do not mention the values of @xmath47 and @xmath8 , we will assume @xmath84 and @xmath85 which corresponds to the `` standard '' mavan scenario , i.e.  where the potential for @xmath13 is quadratic and where the seesaw mechanism is of type i. we will also focus on the case where the neutrinos are non - relativistic today .",
    "the friedmann equation in our scenario takes the form @xmath86 and the scalar field @xmath13 obeys the following modified klein gordon equation @xmath87 we note that while the dark matter density @xmath88 redshifts as @xmath89 , the time dependence of the neutrino energy density is non - trivial due to the time - dependence of @xmath13 .",
    "now we use _ adiabaticity _ , i.e.  the feature of mavan scenario that the acceleron field adiabatically follows the minimum of the effective potential since long time back in the cosmic history .",
    "consequently , the condition @xmath90 determines the evolution of the scalar field to be @xmath91 the present value of @xmath92 can be found from the above equation and is given by @xmath93 which allows to derive the relation @xmath94 where @xmath95 has been used with @xmath4 being the redshift . from this expression",
    "we can calculate the kinetic energy of the field compared to the total energy density carried by the field , @xmath96 we can see that if the field value of @xmath13 today is smaller than the planck scale @xmath97 , the kinetic energy of the field can consistently be neglected for the relevant time of the evolution of the dark energy is typically required with respect to the stability issues for non - relativistic neutrinos ( c.f .",
    "discussion in section [ stability ] ) . ] .",
    "in addition , a constant vacuum energy contribution further reduces the significance of the kinetic energy compared to the hubble constant during the evolution . we will discuss the adiabaticity condition of the acceleron field in section [ the mavan hybrid scenarios with high scale seesaw mechanism ] .    using eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) and comparing the potential energy @xmath17 to the acceleron - dependent neutrino fluid density in eq .",
    "( [ effectivevback ] ) , we find that the ratio of the cosmological density parameters of these two components is given by @xmath98 where we have substituted @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we would like to highlight the result that the ratio of the energy densities from the interaction term and from the potential term @xmath17 is constant in time .",
    "this feature , which is basically a by - product of the adiabaticity condition , will be useful to derive constraints on the model parameters from cosmological observations and it will lead to a particularly close connection to the neutrino mass scale in the mavan hybrid scenario with power law potentials .      using the above results for the background evolution , we will now investigate how the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath8 and @xmath32 of the model are constrained by cosmological observations , in particularly regarding the dark energy equation of state , as well as by the present bounds on ( and eventually by a future measurement of ) the neutrino mass scale @xmath55 .",
    ", as we will discuss below .",
    "in fact , one `` smoking gun '' signal of mavan scenarios would be a `` cosmological upper bound '' on the sum of neutrino masses ( if they are assumed as constant in time ) which is incompatible with todays lower bound from terrestrial experiments .",
    "] we will start by deriving the effective dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the main point here is that when the dark energy equation of state is extracted from cosmological data sensitive to the hubble scale @xmath101 , it is always assumed that the dark matter component redshifts as @xmath102 .",
    "massive neutrinos also contribute a small fraction to the dark matter today .",
    "the total dark matter density today is then given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the amount of cold dark matter and where @xmath105 is calculated from the actual value of the neutrino mass @xmath106 ( which may be determined more precisely by future experiments ) , i.e.  @xmath107 .",
    "however , as we have already mentioned , the neutrino masses vary with time and therefore this contribution does not redshift as @xmath102 . consequently , an observer will not extract the intrinsic dark energy equation of state , but rather an effective one , @xmath108 .",
    "more explicitly , the effective dark energy density ( which defines the effective equation of state @xmath108 ) is extracted from the hubble equation ( assuming for simplicity a flat universe ) @xmath109 where it is ( wrongly , but for a model - independent analysis unavoidably ) assumed that the neutrino density redshifts like ordinary matter .",
    "we would like to add a few remarks to clarify the notation : @xmath105 ( i.e.  the value of the quantity @xmath110 today ) is same as @xmath111 .",
    "however , in an earlier epoch , the true neutrino energy density @xmath112 is _ not _ equal to the quantity @xmath113 .    to calculate @xmath114 ,",

    ", we will now comment on how the `` high - scale '' seesaw might help with respect to stability issues for non - relativistic neutrinos .",
    "in this section we will comment on the stability issue regarding the neutrino density perturbations , which are typically considered as a serious problem for mavan scenarios with non - relativistic neutrinos .",
    "let us first briefly review the problem : soon after the introduction of the original mavan scenario @xcite , it has been pointed out @xcite that the original scenario faces a catastrophic instability for non - relativistic neutrinos due to the extra force carried between neutrinos and the acceleron field @xmath13 . with the mass @xmath195 of the field @xmath13 much larger than the hubble scale , it has been argued that the adiabatic perturbations at scales between @xmath196 are unstable .",
    "let us now discuss how this problem might be overcome in the mavan hybrid scenarios with a `` high - scale '' seesaw mechanism . rather than attempting a full numerical analysis of the density perturbations of the neutrinos in this paper ( which we will leave for a future study ) , we will provide qualitative arguments and analytical estimates which will show how the mavan hybrid scenarios might help to suppress dangerous instabilities .",
    "we will start with a general consideration regarding the coupling between the neutrinos and the acceleron field , and then turn to analytical criteria for the occurrence of the instabilities .    one main difference between the mavan hybrid scenarios with power law type potentials ( where a `` high - scale '' seesaw mechanism is in principle possible ) and",
    "the standard mavan scenario is that in the former the present value @xmath92 of the acceleron field can be much larger than the ev scale , even close to the gut or planck scale .",
    "one can readily see that this might help with respect to the stability issue , when the heavy right - handed neutrino fields @xmath12 are integrated out the theory .",
    "then , the interaction term between the light neutrino(s ) and the acceleron field becomes ( for , e.g. , @xmath197 ) @xmath198 where @xmath199 with @xmath200 denoting the quantum fluctuations around the classical value of the field @xmath92 . with @xmath201 , the term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stab_1 ] ) takes the form @xmath202 where @xmath203 . in the usual mavan scenario",
    "the field value @xmath92 is not much larger than @xmath152 .",
    "in contrast to this , as we have discussed in the previous section , in the mavan hybrid scenarios with power law potentials the present value of @xmath92 can in principle be as large as the gut scale ( or planck scale ) and the coupling between neutrinos and @xmath13 can be strongly suppressed ( by a factor @xmath204 ) .",
    "let us now turn to the analytical criteria : first of all we note that when revisiting the stability issues of the mavan scenario , in ref .",
    "@xcite bjaelde @xmath205 have argued that a negative value of the sound speed does @xmath206 always indicate the occurance of an instability . due to the dragging force of cold dark",
    "matter , neutrino perturbations can remain stable even if the sound speed of the dark energy fluid becomes negative . more specifically , the dragging force due to the dark matter and baryons can stabilise the neutrino perturbations if the condition @xcite , @xmath207 is satisfied , where @xmath208 and where the coupling function @xmath209 is defined as @xmath210 with @xmath211 for the case @xmath46 . using the above definitions the stability condition of eq .",
    "( [ compare ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath212 from this equation we can see that a small value of @xmath213 ( i.e.  a small neutrino mass scale today ) as well as a larger value of @xmath214 compared to @xmath215 can help to stabilise the neutrino perturbations",
    ".    setting @xmath216 for simplicity and using eq .",
    "( [ stabilitycondition ] ) , we find that , e.g. , for @xmath217 ev , @xmath209 has to be smaller than @xmath218 or for @xmath219 ev , @xmath209 has to be less than @xmath220 . in order to avoid the instability the present value of @xmath13 should therefore be larger than about @xmath221 for @xmath219 ev and @xmath222 for @xmath217 ev . for the case",
    "@xmath219 ev this condition is well compatible with the adiabaticity condition in eq .",
    "( [ kinoverdensity ] ) and the simple analytical consideration suggests that the instability problem might be cured . on the other hand , for @xmath223 the adiabaticity and the stability conditions can not safely be satisfied simultaneously and we conclude that whether the instability appears has to be checked numerically . and",
    "it is therefore still negative in our model , however , as we have mentioned before we are following the argument of @xcite that despite a negative sound speed the instability can be avoided by the dragging force of dark matter . ]    finally , we would like to note that , as we have discussed in section 4 , for the most standard types of potentials ( e.g.  with @xmath224 ) the dynamical contribution to the total dark energy is rather small ( typically a few percent ) , and the main contribution arises from a constant vacuum energy density .",
    "this means that even if the neutrinos would cluster , the observable effects on the smoothness of dark energy are much smaller than in the standard mavan scenario .",
    "another related question is whether the scales on which neutrinos might cluster finally leads to any observable effect @xcite .",
    "we conclude by remarking that although we have given some arguments which suggest that stability problems for non - relativistic neutrinos could be resolved in certain mavan hybrid scenarios with `` high - scale '' seesaw , this issue requires further investigations ( which are left for future studies ) .",
    "motivated by the intriguing proximity of the energy density of dark energy and the neutrino mass scale we have studied the phenomenology of hybrid scenarios of neutrino dark energy , where in addition to a so - called mass varying neutrino ( mavan ) sector , a cosmological constant ( from a false vacuum ) is driving the accelerated expansion of the universe today . within the generalised framework we have focused on phenomenological issues such as on the connection to the neutrino mass scale and on its consequences for the dynamical nature of dark energy .",
    "we have therefore calculated the effective equation of state parameter @xmath0 in the mavan hybrid scenario where the effective potential for the dynamical real scalar field ( the `` acceleron '' field @xmath13 ) has the following form @xmath225 we found that , for the case of a power law potential in the mavan sector , @xmath0 is determined by the neutrino mass scale and by the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath8 ( c.f .",

    "[ weffective_plot ] ) , which could be tested in future cosmological observations . for the considered scenarios ,",
    "we have also calculated how the neutrino mass scale determines which fraction of the dark energy is dynamical , and which originates from the `` cosmological constant like '' vacuum energy .",
    "in particular , for the case of a mass term potential and a standard seesaw relation ( i.e.  @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) we found that compatibility with the terrestrial neutrino mass bounds requires a large contribution of constant vacuum energy ( c.f .",
    "( [ eq : mnuvsgamma ] ) ) .    another interesting question , which we have investigated in the mavan hybrid scenario with power law potentials is whether it is possible to realise neutrino dark energy with a `` high - scale '' seesaw mechanism , where the right - handed neutrino masses are close to the gut scale .",
    "we found that the field value of the `` acceleron '' field as well as the masses of the right - handed neutrinos can indeed be large and in principle a hybrid scenario of neutrino dark energy might be realised with a `` high - scale '' seesaw .",
    "we have also commented on how the hybrid mavan scenarios with `` high - scale '' seesaw might allow to suppress the formation of `` neutrino nuggets '' and resolve stability problems of dark energy models with non - relativistic neutrinos .    in summary , we have found that the considered hybrid scenarios of neutrino dark energy have several attractive features , in particular the close connection to the neutrino mass scale and an effective dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath0 which depends only on the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath8 of the potential and on the neutrino mass scale .",
    "the prediction that @xmath226 for @xmath2 provides a `` smoking gun '' signal for such interacting dark energy scenarios , which could be observed in future surveys .",
    "issues which are still open , and which are left for further studies , are whether a mavan hybrid scenario with `` high - scale '' seesaw can indeed solve the stability problems of conventional mavan scenarios with non - relativistic neutrinos and whether a consistent model can be constructed where this is realised .",
