    "a large variety of systems in physics , chemistry , biology , population genetics , or traffic flows can be modeled by reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "these processes are stochastic out - of - equilibrium models describing particles of one or several species which randomly diffuse on a lattice and can undergo some reactions at given rates when they meet @xcite .",
    "these models are of fundamental importance both from a phenomenological and from a theoretical point of view .",
    "they generically feature pattern formation and non - equilibrium phase transitions , such as the ubiquituous transition to an absorbing state which traps the system @xcite .",
    "reaction - diffusion processes hence provide simple models to study non - equilibrium scaling and phase transitions . whereas the one - species processes are relatively well understood @xcite , the multi - particle processes are far less explored .",
    "in this work , we consider the diffusive epidemic process ( dep )  @xcite , which is the two - species ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) reaction - diffusion system with reactions : @xmath4 the species @xmath2 and @xmath3 diffuse independently with diffusion constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "they can be interpreted as healthy and sick individuals respectively , undergoing infection on contact at rate @xmath7 and spontaneous recovery at rate @xmath8 .",
    "a salient feature of this process is that the total number of particles is conserved .",
    "this model was theoretically studied using field theory and renormalization group ( rg ) in  @xcite .",
    "an action for dep was derived using the doi - peliti formalism  @xcite and analyzed perturbatively . for equal diffusion rates",
    ", the authors found that at a critical population density , a continuous absorbing phase transition occurs with upper critical dimension @xmath0 , which does not belong to the ubiquitous directed percolation ( dp ) universality class but to a new class ( kss ) introduced in  @xcite to model the effect of pollution on a population .",
    "the kss universality class is endowed with the critical exponents @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( that is @xmath12 ) to first - order in @xmath13 . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the authors of  @xcite predicted a continuous transition of yet a new ( woh ) universality class ( distinct from dp and kss ) with exponents @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) to all orders in @xmath17 . for @xmath18 , a fluctuation - induced first order transition was conjectured and was seemingly confirmed in  @xcite by analytical arguments and numerical simulations in @xmath19 .",

    "one of the outcomes of the previous analysis is that for dp - c , the identities @xmath20 and @xmath24 imply @xmath25 exactly for @xmath26 .",
    "hence the dp - c action can not account for a non - trivial value of @xmath23 , as seems to be observed in this case in lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry ( [ symiii ] ) provides a possible scenario for the transition from dep to dp - c .",
    "let us examine an infinitesimal version of  ( [ symiii ] ) : @xmath27 .",
    "the associated ward identity implies that the corresponding symmetry is transposed to the effective action .",
    "accordingly , the effective action is invariant under @xmath28 .",
    "we expect @xmath29 to have a positive scaling dimension so that in terms of adimensioned fields , one gets @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , when the renormalization group scale @xmath7 flows to zero , the constant shift term becomes dominant and the ( time independent version of the ) symmetry ( [ symi ] ) is recovered .",
    "in fact , we present below results from the integration of the nprg flow which confirm to some extent this scenario .    however , let us note that this property is not sufficient to ensure that the dep transition belongs to the universality class of dp - c . indeed , the exponents of dp - c follow from the conjunction of both the space - time gauged shift ( [ symi ] ) and the duality relation ( [ symii ] )",
    "however , none of these symmetries is preserved for dep , since a renormalization of the @xmath31 propagator is allowed .",
    "consequently @xmath32 can still depart from @xmath33 even though the shift symmetry is restored in the infrared at the dep fixed point .",
    "of course , these symmetries can always appear as accidental symmetries of the fixed point .",
    "indeed , the field theoretical results @xcite suggest that this is the case for spacial dimensions close to the upper critical dimension , where the only relevant terms are the cubic ones , and the cubic action satisfies these gauged symmetries .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the gauged identities remain attractive at the relevant infrared fixed point in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "this connects with the original question raised in @xcite : the dp - c fixed point has _ a priori _ more symmetries than the dep one . whether the dp - c fixed point continues to control the dep transition in low dimensions ( as it does near the upper critical dimension ) , is a dynamical question to be investigated .",
    "our task in the remainder of the article is to study both dp - c and dep through their respective symmetries with the help of nprg techniques .",
    "the nprg procedure for equilibrium systems @xcite can be straightforwardly generalized to out - of - equilibrium phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is to modify the generating functional ( [ partfunc ] ) by adding a scale dependent quadratic regulator .",
    "generically , @xmath34",
    "\\equiv \\int \\mathcal{d}[\\phi ] \\ , e^{-s -\\frac{1}{2}r_k^{\\alpha\\beta}\\phi_{\\alpha}\\phi_{\\beta } + j^{\\alpha}\\phi_{\\alpha}}\\ , , \\ ] ] where , as before , greek indices stand for coordinate and internal indices .",
    "the role of the regulator @xmath35 is to smoothly replace momenta @xmath36 in the propagator with @xmath7 ( denoting @xmath37 ) . here , both the @xmath38 and @xmath39 propagators are regulated ; more precisely @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are running coefficients defined in eq .",
    "( [ ansatzdpc ] ) . in this work ,",
    "we choose to use the cutoff function @xmath45 proposed by litim  @xcite @xmath46 which allows for analytical integration on momenta .",
    "the regulated cumulant generating functional and its ( modified ) legendre transform are then defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , generalizing previous definitions in presence of the infrared regulator .",
    "the evolution of @xmath49 with the rg scale @xmath7 is given by the exact flow equation  @xcite : @xmath50 which smoothly interpolates between the mean - field effective action @xmath51 and the exact effective action @xmath52 , when @xmath7 is lowered from a microscopic uv cutoff @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "at this point , in order to integrate ( [ wetterich ] ) , some approximations have to be made based on the properties of @xmath35 and on identities coming from the symmetries of @xmath49 .      in order to propose appropriate anstze for @xmath49",
    ", its general form must be constrained by the symmetries of the action .",
    "this is achieved as previously through the use of ward identities , generalized to account for the presence of the infrared regulator @xmath35 ( see appendix  [ ward ] ) .",
    "in particular , the ward identity ( [ wardidsansreg ] ) remains true for @xmath49 , and yields that @xmath49 endows the same general form as ( [ gammagen ] ) @xmath55\\ , , \\ ] ] with the explicit kinetic terms unrenormalized and @xmath56 invariant under ( [ symi ] ) .",
    "this implies that the nprg flow maintains the property @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath26 , then the flow also preserves @xmath59 , _ i.e. _ @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , using the duality transformation ( [ symii ] ) , one obtains the constraint ( see appendix [ ward ] ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the effective potential , which corresponds to @xmath49 evaluated for homogeneous static fields ( divided by the space - time volume ) . within an adequate parametrization of @xmath61",
    ", one can deduce from ( [ ward0 ] ) that @xmath20 exactly , and at the same time identify the relevant direction of the flow , see appendix  [ ward ] .",
    "hence , within the nprg framework , the modified ward identities also fix the exact values for the critical exponents of dp - c , gathered in table  [ exact ] .      using the above contraints",
    ", we propose an ansatz for @xmath49 . in this work",
    ", we restrict to the local potential approximation , or lpa , modified minimally to account for the renormalization of the fields  @xcite , a modification which is referred to as lpa. it means that the only momentum dependence of @xmath49 is contained in the bare propagator ( up to the scaling factor for the field ) , while the potential part @xmath61 is renormalized : @xmath62 furthermore , while some of the results presented below are valid for an arbitrary potential , the integration of the flow and the search for a fixed point are performed by taylor expanding @xmath61 ( around a minimum for @xmath63 , see appendix [ ward ] ) to a finite order ( from cubic up to sextic ) and truncating the corresponding flow equations at the same order .",
    "the derivation of the flow equations is explained in appendix [ nprg ] .",
    "the lpa ( or lpa ) approximations are simple to implement , and straightforward to relate to known perturbative renormalization results .",
    "it gives a fairly accurate view of the physics in most problems .",
    "however , it also has limitations , as emphasized in the following .    for the cubic order ( which corresponds to a renormalization of the coupling constants of the vertices of the dp - c bare action )",
    ", we find a critical fixed point for any dimensions below @xmath64 and for any value of @xmath21 .",
    "it corresponds to the fixed point precedently described perturbatively in  @xcite . for @xmath65",
    ", we also find that a fixed point exists , but the flow can not reach it since this would require for the vertex @xmath66 to change sign , which is prevented in our scheme by the expansion around the minimum .",
    "this is manifest in eq .",
    "( [ eqmin ] ) , the corresponding coupling @xmath67 can not vanish .    from the quartic to sextic order , we find a fixed point with one unstable direction for all values of @xmath21 , but only for @xmath68 .",
    "let us first discuss the case @xmath69 .",
    "the values of @xmath70 at the corresponding fixed point are displayed as a function of the dimension in fig .",
    "[ result_mu0 ] .",
    "a striking difference is manifest between the lowest and higher orders . for @xmath71",
    ", we obtain the value @xmath72 at quartic order . for higher orders ,",
    "the values of @xmath70 at different dimensions are similar to those of the quartic order , but the fixed point solution is lost at a dimension slightly higher than @xmath71 . if extrapolated to @xmath73 , these values seem to be in accordance with the simulations in @xmath73 , but the fixed point solution disappears in dimension @xmath74 .",
    "unfortunately , it is computationally too costly to implement the septic and higher orders . the way to progress would be to deal with richer anstze , for example using the full effective potential without truncation . at this point , as discussed below , it is not clear whether the disappearance of the fixed point is an artifact due to the finite - order truncation of the lpa , or if it is related to the intrinsic nature of the dp - c fixed point and its relation to dep .

    "thick saltires mark the disappearance of the fixed point .",
    "( colors online),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] ;    in the @xmath76 case , this problem seems even sharper ( see fig . [ result_mu ] ) , since the domain of existence of the fixed point with one unstable direction describing the transition around @xmath77 is not under control as the truncation order increases .",
    "finally , when @xmath65 , the same fixed point as for @xmath76 is present , but it can not be reached from the bare action . besides this fixed point , from the order four in the field expansion , we find a new fixed point in the physical region of parameters .",
    "in contrast with the perturbative calculations but in agreement with the numerical simulations , this finding supports the existence of a second order phase transition for @xmath65 . however , we are not able to convincingly assess the convergence of this result with the order of the truncation in the field expansion , since the domain of existence of this fixed point also varies significantly as the order is increased .",
    "let us note that for @xmath26 , as @xmath24 , the only non - trivial exponent for the dp - c class is @xmath78 ( see table [ exact ] ) .",
    "this exponent is related to @xmath79 , the critical initial slip exponent .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to compare the value of @xmath78 obtained for @xmath80 in @xmath71 to simulations in order to test the relevance of the corresponding fixed point .",
    "unfortunately no such determination exists in the literature for @xmath81 . in both cases ,",
    "the disappearance of the dp - c fixed point gives rise to the same question as in the @xmath69 case .",

    "as already mentioned , some dp - c predictions for critical exponents ( such as @xmath85 for @xmath26 ) seem to be inconsistent with the results of lattice simulations . independently of this last point",
    ", it is unsatisfactory from a nprg point of view not to pinpoint how the dp - c symmetries can emerge along the flow from a microscopic action lacking these symmetries .    as an attempt to clarify this issue",
    ", we studied the flow of a potential @xmath86 symmetric under the transformation ( [ symiii ] ) related to the dep action , taylor expanded both in @xmath29 and @xmath87 around a minimum value .",
    "we find that , in dimensions @xmath88 where the dp - c fixed point exists , the effective action preserves the rescaling symmetry ( [ symiii ] ) along the flow , which progressively behaves as the shift symmetry ( [ symi ] ) , eventually recovered at long distance , for any value of @xmath21 , confirming the scenario proposed in sec .",
    "[ scenario ] .",
    "however , this scenario only holds for values of @xmath75 where the dp - c fixed point exists and has the appropriate number of relevant directions in order to control the critical behaviour ( which depend on @xmath21 and on the order of the truncation ) . below this value",
    ", the flow leads to another fixed point which is unphysical or diverges .",
    "this new fixed point is presumably spurious but its existence may be the reason why the dp - c fixed point ceases to exist below a certain dimension .",
    "we conjecture that if a more elaborate approximation describing a broader theory space than dp - c was used , the same mechanism would occur in small dimensions but the flow would lead to a genuine fixed point , which is absent in our truncation .",
    "let us explain why the lpa does not suffice to resolve this issue .",
    "first , let us note that the analysis of the diagrams involved in the perturbative renormalization of the theory shows that the conjunction of the @xmath89 term as a multiplicative factor of the potential and the it@xmath90 s prescription  @xcite ( which forbids tadpoles in the perturbative formalism and also within the lpa approximation ) implies that in practice the @xmath91 propagator can not be renormalized and hence no fixed point other than the dp - c one can be reached starting from the dep action .",
    "the same conclusion holds within the lpa approximation , regardless whether the effective potential is expanded or not . in order to study the possible differences between dep and dp - c , a more elaborate approximation , allowing in particular for a renormalization of the @xmath91 propagator",
    "has to be implemented . in this respect",
    ", the grassberger formulation seems to be a better starting point because , as already said , its variation under the time - gauged shift ( [ symi ] ) is linear .",
    "futhermore , in the case @xmath69 , the kpz - like tilt symmetry of ( [ tilt ] ) could be exploited .",
    "this may constitute the subject of a future work .",
    "we analyzed the action of dp - c and dep , and provided a detailed analysis of their respective symmetries , unveiling in particular new symmetries that were not identified before .",
    "we then studied the dp - c action in the framework of non - perturbative renormalization , using a modified local potential approximation lpa. we recovered the results of previous field theoretical studies at one - loop in the @xmath17-expansion @xcite , that is the existence of a dp - c fixed point for @xmath69 and @xmath76 .",
    "however , it turns out that this result can not be simply extended to @xmath73 and @xmath92 .",
    "indeed , we observed ( within the lpa ) that this fixed point no longer exists below a certain dimension @xmath74 . at this stage ,",
    "two possible explanations can be contemplated .",
    "the disappearance of the dp - c fixed point can be an artifact of the lpa approximation implemented in this work , which means that finding the dp - c fixed point is low dimensions requires a higher - order approximation .",
    "the alternative interpretation is that the dp - c fixed point ceases to control the absorbing transition in low dimensions , and thus that the transition in the dep model is driven by another fixed point , which has less symmetries than the dp - c one .",
    "investigating this scenario also requires a more elaborate approximation , able to distinguish between the dep and dp - c renormalizations .",
    "this interpretation means that the transitions observed in lattice simulations in @xmath73 or 2 do not correspond to the dp - c universality class , but to a genuine dep class , where the exponent values are not fixed by the exact dp - c identities .",
    "this scenario could explain the mismatch between the exact predictions coming from the symmetries of the dp - c fixed point , and results obtained in lattice simulations .",
    "in conclusion , the study of dep and of its possible coarse - grained counterpart , dp - c , is far from being a settled subject .",
    "we hope to be able to answer the questions raised in this article in future studies .",
    "within the nprg framework , in the presence of the infrared regulator @xmath35 , ward identities can be derived by considering an infinitesimal change of variable in @xmath44  @xcite : @xmath93 if the jacobian of the change of variables is one , and using @xmath94 , one obtains @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "it means that the variation of @xmath49 is equal to the mean of the variation of @xmath98 ( up to a possible regulator term ) .",
    "the right - hand side can be made explicit if @xmath99 is linear in the field and the regulator term is invariant .",
    "this is a standard result for a global symmetry of the action .",
    "another interesting case is when a global shift ( @xmath100 ) symmetry of the action is gauged . under the condition that the momentum dependence of @xmath98 is only contained in its quadratic part",
    ", one can derive a local constraint on @xmath49 .",
    "this is the case for the symmetry ( [ symi ] ) of dp - c .",
    "the variation of @xmath49 under its gauged version reads @xmath101 this identity means that these two terms are not renormalized , and the remaining part of @xmath49 must be invariant under the transformation ( [ symi ] ) .",
    "that is , it can only depend on @xmath102 , hence the parametrization ( [ ansatzdpc ] ) .    the exact value for the exponent @xmath32 is then fixed by the duality ( [ symii ] ) .",
    "indeed , performing the infinitesimal change of variable @xmath103 in @xmath44 , one obtains the ward identity @xmath104 evaluating this identity for a uniform and static field configuration then yields @xmath105 since @xmath61 is analytic , let us consider the expansion of @xmath61 around a minimum @xmath106 for @xmath63 @xmath107 such that @xmath108 ( notice that the property @xmath109 can be shown to be conserved by the flow , which is why the minimum is defined after derivation with respect to @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) .",

    "<S> we consider the diffusive epidemic process ( dep ) , a two - species reaction - diffusion process originally proposed to model disease spread within a population . </S>",
    "<S> this model exhibits a phase transition from an active epidemic to an absorbing state without sick individuals . </S>",
    "<S> field - theoretic analyses suggest that this transition belongs to the universality class of directed percolation with a conserved quantity ( dp - c ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , some exact predictions derived from the symmetries of dp - c seem to be in contradiction with lattice simulations . </S>",
    "<S> here we revisit the field theory of both dp - c and dep . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the symmetries present in the various formulations of both models , some of which had not been identified previously . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate the dp - c model using the derivative expansion of the non - perturbative renormalization group formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we recover previous results for dp - c near its upper critical dimension @xmath0 , but show how the corresponding fixed point seems to no longer exist below @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> consequences for the dep universality class are considered . </S>"
