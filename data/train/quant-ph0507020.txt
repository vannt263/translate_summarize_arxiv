    "some measurements are known to be logically reversible  @xcite .",
    "royer  @xcite proposed a physically reversible quantum measurement of a spin-@xmath2 system using a spin-@xmath2 probe in an attempt to completely determine the unknown quantum state of a single system ( see , however , erratum of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the context of quantum computation  @xcite",
    ", the reversing measurement has been discussed for reducing the qubit overhead in quantum error correction  @xcite and for improving the probability of successful nonunitary gate operation in a nonunitary quantum circuit  @xcite . as an important step toward the experimental realization of a reversible measurement , a photodetection scheme that satisfies a necessary condition for logical reversibility ( `` sensitivity to vacuum fluctuations '' ) has recently been demonstrated  @xcite using a stimulated parametric down - conversion process .    in this paper , we propose a scheme for making a physically reversible quantum measurement that is experimentally feasible in view of recent advances in experimental techniques  @xcite .",
    "our model consists of two arbitrary spin systems ( a measured system and a probe system ) interacting via an ising hamiltonian .",
    "since spin can describe diverse physical systems ( e.g. , the real spin of particles , collective two - level systems , cooper pairs , interferometers , and josephson junctions ) , our model can be used to implement both physically reversible measurements and reversing measurements in such diverse systems .",
    "we explicitly construct a reversing measurement for our model , in which quantitative analysis is performed in terms of fidelity  @xcite .",
    "when the probe system has a high spin , the fidelity changes drastically in both the reversible measurement and the reversing measurement .",
    "the high - spin probe thus makes the recovery of the measured state more pronounced than for the spin-@xmath2 model , though at the cost of decreasing the probability of successful recovery .    to clarify what kind of irreversibility is at issue",
    ", we here review a projective measurement  @xcite , which is often used to describe measurement processes in quantum theory . let @xmath9 be a measured observable , whose eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the observable @xmath9 can then be decomposed as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the projector @xmath14 . from the completeness condition , the projectors @xmath15",
    "satisfy @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the identity operator .",
    "suppose that the measured system is initially in a state @xmath18 . the projective measurement with respect to @xmath15 yields an outcome @xmath10 with probability @xmath19 and then causes a state reduction of the measured system to @xmath20 clearly , the projective measurement is irreversible in the sense that we can not recover the premeasurement state @xmath18 from the postmeasurement state @xmath21 , unless we _ a priori _ know the former state .",
    "this is because the information about the states orthogonal to @xmath13 is completely lost during the measurement .",
    "one might think that any quantum measurement has this type of irreversibility , since quantum measurement entails a nonunitary state reduction associated with information readout .",
    "however , there exist quantum measurements that are logically reversible in spite of nonunitary state reduction  @xcite .",
    "to formulate the conditions for logical reversibility , we adopt a general formulation of quantum measurement  @xcite , in which a quantum measurement is described by a set of measurement operators @xmath22 that satisfies @xmath23",
    "if the measured system is in a state @xmath18 , the general measurement with respect to @xmath22 yields an outcome @xmath10 with probability @xmath24 and then causes a state reduction of the measured system to @xmath25 note that this state change depends on the outcome @xmath10 . the general measurement can be simulated by a projective measurement with the help of a measurement probe , even though the projective measurement is a special case of the general measurement ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for logical reversibility is @xmath27 for any @xmath18 in the hilbert space  @xcite . in other words",
    ", the measurement must respond to any input state so that no possibility of the premeasurement state is excluded by any outcome of the measurement .",
    "for example , usual photon counting  @xcite is logically irreversible because the detection of a photon excludes the possibility that the premeasurement state is the vacuum state . on the other hand",
    ", the necessary and sufficient condition for physical reversibility is that @xmath28 has a bounded left inverse  @xcite .",
    "thus physical reversibility implies logical reversibility , but not vice versa .",
    "an important special case is that of a finite - dimensional hilbert space , where physical reversibility is equivalent to logical reversibility .",
    "however , in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space , there exist logically reversible yet physically irreversible measurements  @xcite such as quantum counting  @xcite .",
    "a different type of reversibility is discussed in refs .",
    "a quantum measurement is said to be unitarily reversible if the premeasurement state can be recovered by a reversing unitary operation on the postmeasurement state . in this case , although successful reversal occurs with unit probability owing to the unitarity , it is essential that the premeasurement state lie within a certain subspace of the entire hilbert space .",
    "since the subspace is chosen so that the probability of each measurement outcome is the same for all states in the subspace , no information about the premeasurement state can be obtained from the unitarily reversible quantum measurement  @xcite .",

    "the weak - interaction model exhibited near - deterministic recovery of a coherent spin state ( [ eq : css ] ) .",

    "the above discussion is based on the fact that the _ joint _ measurement @xmath93 and @xmath100 changes the measured state little .",
    "one might think therefore that the measured state is changed little throughout the whole measurement process .",
    "it should , however , be recalled that the first measurement @xmath93 can change the measured state substantially ( see fig .  [ fig9 ] ) through the high spin @xmath1 of the probe .",
    "the average fidelity after the first measurement is given by @xmath308 \\left(\\sin^2\\theta+2j\\cos^2\\theta\\right ) \\label{eq : avsqfi}\\ ] ] to the second order in @xmath81 .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , this average fidelity becomes small , even if the strength of the interaction @xmath81 is decreased as @xmath309 , in accordance with the weak - interaction condition ( [ eq : weakcond ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : avsqfi ] ) is not valid when @xmath1 is so large that the second term becomes comparable to @xmath232 . )",

    "on the other hand , the change in the measured state by the joint measurement @xmath93 and @xmath100 remains small , since the effect of the second measurement can also be amplified by the high - spin probe so as to cancel that of the first measurement .",

    "( [ eq : avfd2w ] ) . as a result , in spite of the near - deterministic recovery by the weak measurements , the change in fidelity can be drastic due to the action of the high - spin probe .",

    "we follow the estimation in ref .  @xcite . for an ensemble of @xmath335 cesium atoms trapped and cooled by laser beams and with the two - mode photons",
    "being laser beams with average photon number @xmath336 , the spins @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both on the order of @xmath337 , while the strength of the interaction @xmath81 is about @xmath338 .",

    "this means that , with a half - wave plate rotated by a very small angle , we can apply the weak - interaction model of the reversible and reversing measurements for a high - spin system .",

    "conversely , when @xmath340 is large , @xmath341 should be on the order of @xmath337 to satisfy the weak - interaction condition .",
    "we have proposed a physically reversible quantum measurement on a spin-@xmath0 system using a spin-@xmath1 probe , along with an experimentally feasible interaction that can experimentally realize reversibility in quantum measurements .",
