    "the factorization of linear partial differential operators ( lpdos ) is an essential part of recent algorithms for the exact solution for linear partial differential equations ( lpdes ) .",
    "examples of such algorithms include numerous generalizations and modifications of the 18th - century laplace transformations method  @xcite , the loewy decomposition method  @xcite , and others .",
    "the problem of constructing a general factorization algorithm for an lpdo is still an open problem , though several important contributions have been made over the last decades ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the main difficulty in the case of lpdos is non - uniqueness of factorization : ( irreducible ) factors and the number of factors are not necessarily the same for two different factorizations of the same operator .",
    "for example , for the famous landau operator  @xcite @xmath0 we have @xmath1 note that the second order factor in the second factorization is hyperbolic and is irreducible .    however , for some classes of lpdos factorization is unique .",
    "for example , there is  @xcite no more than one factorization that extends a factorization of the principal symbol of the operator into co - prime factors ( see theorem  [ thm : gs ] )",
    ".    some important methods of exact integration , for example , mentioned above loewy decomposition methods require lpdos to have a number of different factorizations of certain types .",
    "also completely reducible lpdos introduced in  @xcite , which becomes significant as the solution space of a completely reducible lpdo coincides with the sum of those of its irreducible right factors may require a number of right factors .",

    "for the proof of the theorems we use invariants methods .",
    "invariants of lpdos under the gauge transformations ( see sec .  [",
