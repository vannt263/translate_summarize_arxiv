    "dynamic traffic assignment ( dta ) is the descriptive modeling of time - varying flows on traffic networks consistent with traffic flow theory and travel choice principles .",
    "dta models describe and predict departure rates , departure times and route choices of travelers over a given time horizon .",
    "it seeks to describe the dynamic evolution of traffic in networks in a fashion consistent with the fundamental notions of traffic flow and travel demand ; see @xcite for some review on dta models and recent developments . _ dynamic user equilibrium _ ( due ) of the open - loop type , which is one type of dta , remains a major modern perspective on traffic modeling that enjoys wide scholarly support .",
    "it captures two aspects of driving behavior quite well : departure time choice and route choice @xcite . within the due model , travel cost for the same trip purpose is identical for all utilized route - and - departure - time choices .",
    "the relevant notion of travel cost is _ effective travel delay _ , which is a weighted sum of actual travel time and arrival penalties .",
    "in the last two decades there have been many efforts to develop a theoretically sound formulation of dynamic network user equilibrium that is also a canonical form acceptable to scholars and practitioners alike .",
    "there are two essential components within the due models : ( 1 ) the mathematical expression of nash - like equilibrium conditions ; and ( 2 ) a network performance model , which is , in effect , an embedded _ dynamic network loading _",
    "( dnl ) problem .",
    "the dnl model captures the relationships among link entry flow , link exit flow , link delay and path delay for any given set of path departure rates .",
    "the dnl gives rise to the notion of _ path delay operator _",
    ", which is viewed as a mapping from the set of feasible path departure rates to the set of path travel times or , more generally , path travel costs .",
    "properties of the path delay operator are of fundamental importance to due models .",
    "in particular , continuity of the delay operators plays a key role in the existence and computation of due models .",
    "the existence of dues is typically established by converting the problem to an equivalent mathematical form and applying some version of brouwer s fixed - point existence theorem ; examples include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of these existence theories rely on the continuity of the path delay operator . on the computational side of analytical due models ,",
    "every established algorithm requires the continuity of the delay operator to ensure convergence ; an incomplete list of such algorithms include the fixed - point algorithm @xcite , the route - swapping algorithm @xcite , the descent method @xcite , the projection method @xcite , and the proximal point method @xcite    it has been difficult historically to show continuity of the delay operator for general network topologies and traffic flow models . over the past decade , only a few continuity results were established for some specific traffic flow models .",
    "@xcite use the link delay model @xcite to show the continuity of the path delay operator .",
    "their result relies on the _ a priori _ boundedness of the path departure rates , and is later improved by a continuity result that is free of such an assumption @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "continuity of the delay operator is shown for networks whose dynamics are described by the lwr - lax model @xcite , which is a variation of the lwr model that does not capture vehicle spillback .",
    "their result also relies on the _ a priori _ boundedness of path departure rates . @xcite",
    "consider vickrey s point queue model @xcite and show the continuity of the corresponding path delay operator for general networks without invoking the boundedness on the path departure rates .",
    "all of these aforementioned results are established for network performance models that do not capture vehicle spillback . to the best of our knowledge , there has not been any rigorous proof of the continuity result for dnl models that allow queue spillback to be explicitly captured . on the contrary ,",
    "some existing studies even show that the path travel times may depend discontinuously on the path departure rates , when physical queue models are used .",
    "for example , @xcite uses the cell transmission model and signal control to show that the path travel time may depend on the path departure rates in a discontinuous way .",
    "such a finding suggests that the continuity of the delay operator could very well fail when spillback is present .",
    "this has been the major hurdle in showing the continuity or identifying relevant conditions under which the continuity is guaranteed .",
    "this paper bridges this gap by articulating these conditions and providing accompanying proof of continuity .",
    "this paper presents , for the first time , a rigorous continuity result for the path delay operator based on the lwr network model , which explicitly captures physical queues and vehicle spillback . in showing the desired continuity ,",
    "we propose a systematic approach for analyzing the well - posedness of two specific junction models : a merge and a diverge model , both originally presented by @xcite .",
    "the underpinning analytical framework employs the _ wave - front tracking _",
    "methodology @xcite and the technique of _ generalized tangent vectors _ @xcite . a major portion of our proof involves the analysis of the interactions between kinematic waves and the junctions , which is frequently invoked for the study of well - posedness of junction models ;",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "such analysis is further complicated by the fact that vehicle turning ratios at a diverge junction are determined endogenously by drivers route choices within the dnl procedure . as a result ,",
    "special tools are developed in this paper to handle this unique situation .",
    "as we shall later see , a crucial step of the process above is to estimate and bound from below the minimum network supply , which is defined in terms of local vehicle densities in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the supply somewhere tends to zero ( that is , when traffic approaches the jam density ) , the well - posedness of the diverge junction may fail , as we demonstrate in section [ subsubsecexample ] .",
    "this has also been confirmed by the earlier study of @xcite , where a wave of jam density is triggered by a signal red light and causes spillback at the upstream junction , leading to a jump in the path travel times .",
    "remarkably , in this paper we are able to show that ( 1 ) if the supply is bounded away from zero ( that is , traffic is bounded away from the jam density ) , then the diverge junction model is well posed ; and ( 2 ) the desired boundedness of the supply is a natural consequence of the dynamic network loading procedure that involves only the merge and diverge junction models we study here .",
    "this is a highly non - trivial result because it not only plays a role in the continuity proof , but also implies that gridlock can never occur in the network loading procedure in any finite time horizon .",
    "the final continuity result is presented in section [ subseccontinuity ] , following a number of preliminary results set out in previous sections .",
    "although our continuity result is established only for networks consisting of simple merge and diverge nodes , it can be extended to networks with more complex topologies using the procedure of decomposing any junction into several simple merge and diverge nodes @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analytical framework employed by this paper can be invoked to treat other and more general junction topologies and/or merging and diverging rules , and the techniques employed to analyze wave interactions will remain valid .",
    "the main contributions made in this paper include :    * formulation of the lwr - based dynamic network loading ( dnl ) model with spillback as a system of _ partial differential algebraic equations _ ( pdaes ) ; * a continuity result for the path delay operator based on the aforementioned dnl model ; * a novel method for estimating the network supply , which shows that gridlock can never occur within a finite time horizon .",

    "@xcite provides an example of discontinuous dependence of the path travel times on the path departure rates using the cell transmission model representation of a signal - controlled network .",
    "in particular , the author showed that when a queue generated by the red signal spills back into the upstream junction , the experienced path travel time jumps from one value to another .",
    "this , however , does not contradict our result presented here for the following reason : the jam density caused by the red signal in @xcite does not exist in our network , which has only merge and diverge junctions ( without any signal controls ) . indeed , as shown in corollary [ cordelta ] , the supply functions at any location in the network are uniformly bounded below by a positive constant , and thus the jam density never occurs in a finite time horizon .",
    "the reader is reminded of the example presented in section [ subsubsecexample ] , where the ill - posedness of the diverge model is caused precisely by the presence of a jam density .",
    "the counterexample from @xcite is constructed essentially in the same way as our example , by using signal controls that create the jam density .",
    "we offer some further insights here on the extension of the continuity result to second - order traffic flow models . to the best of our knowledge , second - order models on traffic networks are mainly based on the aw - rascle - zhang model @xcite and the phase - transition model @xcite .",
    "solutions of the aw - rascle - zhang system may present the vacuum state , which , in general , may prevent continuous dependence @xcite . on the other hand , the phase transition model on networks",
    "behaves in a way similar to the lwr scalar conservation law model .",
    "however , continuous dependence may be violated for density close to maximal ; see @xcite .",
    "therefore , extensions of the continuity result to second - order models appear possible only for the phase - transition type models with appropriate assumptions on the maximal density achievable on the network , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "this paper presents , for the first time , a rigorous continuity result for the path delay operator based on the lwr network model with spillback explicitly captured .",
    "this continuity result is crucial to many dynamic traffic assignment models in terms of solution existence and computation .",
    "similar continuity results have been established in a number of studies , all of which are concerned with non - physical queue models . as we show in section [ subsubsecexample ] , the well - posedness of a diverge model",
    "may not hold when spillback occurs .",
    "this observation , along with others made in previous studies @xcite , have been the major source of difficulty in showing continuity of the delay operator . in this paper , we bridge this gap through rigorous mathematical analysis involving the wave front tracking method and the generalized tangent vectors . in particular , by virtue of the finite propagation speeds of @xmath177-waves and @xmath176-waves ,",
    "the continuity of the delay operator boils down to the well - posedness of nodal models , including models for the origins , diverge nodes , and merge nodes .",
    "minor assumptions are made on the fundamental diagram and the path departure rates in order to provide an upper bound on the total variations of the density @xmath177 and the path disaggregation variables @xmath176 , which subsequently leads to the desired well - posedness of the nodal models and eventually the continuity of the operator .",
    "a crucial step of the above process is to estimate and bound from below the minimum network supply , which is defined in terms of local vehicle densities .",
    "in fact , if the supply of some link tends to zero , the well - posedness of the diverge junction may fail as we demonstrate in section [ subsubsecexample ] .",
    "this has also been confirmed by an earlier study @xcite , where a wave of jam density is triggered by a signal red light and causes spillback at the upstream junction , leading to a jump in the path travel times .",

    "more precisely , denote by @xmath450 and @xmath451 the wave respectively before and after the interaction , we have @xmath452 where @xmath453 or @xmath454 and is bounded away from zero .",
    "since the @xmath176-waves travel only forward on the links with uniformly bounded speed , we must have that the interactions with diverge junctions can occur only finite number of times . thus we conclude that @xmath176 has bounded total variation .",
    "let @xmath455 be the shift of the @xmath96-th jump of @xmath261 , which occurs at time @xmath456 , then the expression of @xmath255 is possibly affected on the interval @xmath457 $ ] ( assuming @xmath458 ) . more precisely , if @xmath459 then no wave is generated on the virtual link while a shift in the queue is generated with @xmath460 , where @xmath461 is the jump in @xmath261 occurring at time @xmath456 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath462 then a wave @xmath463 is produced at time @xmath456 on the virtual link with shift @xmath464 where @xmath465 is the speed of the wave @xmath463 .",
    "we can then compute : @xmath466 moreover , @xmath467 , thus the norm of the tangent vector generated is the same as before .    to prove that the norm of the tangent vector @xmath252 is bounded for all times , let us first consider a backward - propagating wave @xmath463 interacting with the queue @xmath468 , and with a shift @xmath469 .",
    "then we can write : @xmath470 where @xmath471 and @xmath472 are the time - derivatives of @xmath255 before and after the interaction , respectively .",
    "therefore , denoting @xmath465 the speed of the wave @xmath463 , we get : @xmath473 thus the norm of the tangent vector is bounded .",
