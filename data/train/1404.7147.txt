    "most stars are expected to form in young star clusters ( yscs , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . like globular clusters ( gcs ) ,",
    "the densest yscs are collisional systems : their two - body relaxation timescale is shorter than their lifetime , and they undergo intense dynamical evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "yscs are considerably different from gcs : the former have generally lower mass ( @xmath3 m@xmath4 ) and smaller size ( half - mass radius @xmath5 pc ) than the latter ( see e.g. @xcite , for a recent review ) .",
    "this explains why the central relaxation time of yscs is @xmath6 myr , orders of magnitude shorter than that of gcs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "yscs populate the disc of late - type galaxies , while gcs are spherically distributed in the host - galaxy halo .",
    "finally , gcs are old ( @xmath7 gyr ) and long - lived systems , whereas yscs are young and short lived : most of them dissolve in the disc of the host galaxy in @xmath8 yr ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the stellar content of dissolved yscs is expected to build up a considerable fraction of the field population of the host galaxy .",
    "this must be taken into account when modelling the evolution of binary stellar systems in the galactic field : a large fraction of these binaries likely formed in yscs , and then evolved through intense dynamical interactions , before being ejected into the field after the disruption of the parent ysc .",
    "this scenario is important for the study of stellar black hole ( bh ) binaries . in (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we studied the formation and the dynamical evolution of accreting bh binaries in yscs .",
    "we found that dynamical interactions in yscs have a significant impact on the expected population of x - ray sources powered by bhs . in the current paper",
    ", we study the formation and the dynamical evolution of black hole - black hole ( bh - bh ) binaries in yscs . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we will compare the evolution of bh - bh binaries with that of neutron star - neutron star ( ns - ns ) binaries and with that of binaries composed of a bh and a neutron star ( ns ) in yscs .",
    "bh - bh , ns - ns and ns - bh binaries are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) detectable by ground - based detectors ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the demographics of such double compact object binaries ( dcobs ) is particularly important in light of the forthcoming second - generation ground - based gw detectors , advanced ligo and virgo @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of yscs can influence the formation and evolution of bh - bh binaries in three different ways : ( i ) dynamical friction causes the bhs ( which are more massive than most stars ) to sink to the denser ysc core , where they have a higher probability to interact with other bhs ( e.g. @xcite ) ; ( ii ) three - body encounters ( i.e. close encounters between a binary and a single star ) change the binary orbital properties : if the binary is hard ( i.e. if its binding energy is higher than the average kinetic energy of a star in the cluster ] where @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mass of the primary member and the mass of the secondary member of the binary , respectively , while @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the average mass and velocity dispersion of a star in the star cluster . ] ) , three - body encounters tend to shrink the binary semi - major axis @xcite ; ( iii ) dynamical exchanges ( i.e. three - body interactions in which one of the members of the binary is replaced by the single star ) enhance the formation of bh - bh binaries .",
    "in fact , the probability for a single star with mass @xmath14 to replace a binary member is higher if @xmath15 or @xmath16 ( where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the masses of the former binary members , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as bhs are more massive than most stars , they efficiently acquire companions through dynamical exchanges .",
    "previous studies investigated the formation and evolution of dcobs either in gcs , via monte carlo codes ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or in the field , using population synthesis simulations of isolated binaries ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our study provides a new perspective on this subject : we study the formation of bh - bh binaries in yscs , by using direct n - body simulations coupled with up - to - date stellar and binary evolution recipes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : methodsandsimulations ] , we briefly describe our simulations . in section [ sec : results ] , we present our results .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to discuss the results and to compare them with previous work .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    ".summary of initial ysc properties [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the timescale for coalescence @xcite is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the speed of light and @xmath9 the gravitational constant .",
    "@xmath19 is the timescale for a binary to merge by gw emission .",
    "it scales as @xmath20 , and it is shorter for high eccentricity .",
    "gw emission affects the coalescence timescale by shrinking the semi - major axis and circularizing the binary orbit .",
    "[ fig : vpeterstimesmap ] shows @xmath19 as a function of semi - major axis , eccentricity and metallicity of the simulated systems .",
    "most of the systems with @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 gyr is the hubble time ) have eccentricity close to zero , as a consequence of circularization by gw emission .",
    "however , we found an outlier ( with eccentricity @xmath23 , see table [ tab : dbhpeterstable ] ) produced by dynamical exchange .",
    "this is interesting not only because its coalescence timescale is short , due to the high value of the eccentricity , but also because it suggests that the use of templates which include eccentric effects in the ligo and virgo searches could be important @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this binary is destroyed by a new dynamical exchange before it merges . on the other hand",
    ", we expect to find other systems like this with a larger simulation sample , and we can not exclude that some of them can evolve ( without being destroyed by further exchanges ) till they merge",
    ". such systems would be very important for gw detection @xcite .",
    "all bh - bh binaries with @xmath21 are at low metallicity ( @xmath24 z@xmath1 and @xmath25 z@xmath1 ) , while we find none at solar metallicity .",
    "the bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : vpeterstimesmap ] show the coalescence timescale for ns - ns binaries .",
    "the total number of ns - ns binaries is much smaller than that of bh - bh binaries but they are much harder . as a consequence ,",
    "their coalescence timescales are generally shorter .",
    "the minimum coalescence timescale for bh - bh binaries in our simulations is @xmath26 gyr , while that for ns - ns binaries is @xmath27 gyr .",
    "we also found that 11 ns - ns binaries actually merged before 100 myr .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vpeterstimesmap ] , we also show the coalescence timescale for ns - bh binaries .",
    "no ns - bh mergers are expected in less than a hubble time , because ns - bh binaries are much less numerous than bh - bh binaries and they are not favoured by dynamical encounters .",
    "tables [ tab : dbhpeterstable ] and [ tab : dnspeters&table ] list the shortest coalescence timescales for bh - bh binaries and ns - ns binaries , respectively .",
    "it has been debated ( e.g. @xcite ) whether @xmath28 is a reliable indicator of the merger timescale in star clusters .",
    "in fact , dynamical interactions in star clusters may affect the evolution of a dcob and delay or anticipate the merger with respect to the expected @xmath28 . in our simulations",
    "there is good agreement between the coalescence timescales and the actual mergers , thus , we can conclude that in most cases dynamics does not affect the actual merger timescale of the simulated ns - ns binaries .",
    "since most stars form in yscs , the mass density of yscs in the universe is expected to scale as the star formation rate ( sfr ) density ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , from the results discussed in section  [ sec : coalescencetimescale ] and using a drake - like equation , the merger rate of bh - bh binaries can be estimated as @xmath29\\,{}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm sf}}{1.5\\times{}10^{-2}\\,{}{\\rm m}_\\odot{}\\,{}{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{}{\\rm mpc}^{-3}}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\\left(\\frac{t_{\\rm life}}{10 ^ 8{\\rm yr}}\\right)\\,{}\\left(\\frac{f_{\\rm sf}}{0.8}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the cosmological density of sfr at redshift zero ( @xmath31 from @xcite ) , @xmath32 is the average lifetime of a ysc , @xmath33 is the fraction of star formation ( sf ) that occurs in yscs ( we take @xmath34 from @xcite ) , and @xmath35 is the number of bh - bh binary mergers per solar mass per year , as estimated from our simulations ( see table  [ tab : dbhpeterstable ] ) . in equation  [ eq : mrgrdbhb ] , we assume that @xmath36 does not change significantly with time . this approximation is reasonable for the distance range of advanced ligo and virgo ( see the short discussion at the end of this section ) .",
    "equation  [ eq : mrgrdbhb ] has been derived following the same approach as explained in mapelli et al .",
    "( 2010a , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the main differences between equation  [ eq : mrgrdbhb ] of this paper and equations 2 and 3 of @xcite are the following : ( i ) in equation  [ eq : mrgrdbhb ] we just estimate the merger rate , while @xcite estimate the detection rate for different interferometers ; ( ii ) in equation  [ eq : mrgrdbhb ] we derive @xmath35 directly from our simulations , while in @xcite we used the results of a toy model for intermediate - mass bhs .",
    "in particular , we estimate @xmath35 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of simulated yscs , @xmath39 is the average mass of a single ysc m@xmath4 , equation  [ eq : mrgrdbhb2 ] suffers from the approximation that we do not consider a mass spectrum for the simulated yscs . on the other hand , yscs with @xmath40 m@xmath4",
    "are among the most diffuse yscs in the local universe ( @xcite ) . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will consider a mass spectrum for the yscs .",
    "] , and @xmath41 is the number of bh - bh binaries that are expected to merge within a time @xmath42 . for example , at @xmath25 z@xmath1 , we find that 3 bh - bh binaries are expected to merge within @xmath43 gyr ( see table  [ tab : dbhpeterstable ] ) . at @xmath24 z@xmath1",
    ", we find 4 bh - bh binaries are expected to merge within @xmath44 gyr , while at @xmath45 z@xmath1 we do not find any bh - bh binaries that merge within @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath47 depending on the metallicity .",
    "the resulting values of the merger rate are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , if we assume that all yscs in the local universe have metallicity @xmath51 and 0.01 z@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "thus , the merger rate of bh - bh binaries is @xmath52 if we assume that all yscs in the local universe formed at low metallicity ( @xmath53 ) , and is @xmath54 if we assume that all yscs in the local universe formed at high metallicity ( @xmath55 ) , since in our simulations we did not find any bh - bh binary at @xmath55 with coalescence timescale shorter than the hubble time .",
    "even if the statistics is low , this result is important , as we can conclude that bh - bh binaries are enhanced at low metallicity , where more massive bhs can form .    as a first - order approximation",
    ", we can assume that the merger rate of bh - bh binaries in the local universe is included in this range of values , i.e. @xmath56 . for a more realistic assumption about the metallicity of yscs in the local universe , see the discussion at the end of this section .",
    "similarly , the merger rate of ns - ns binaries can be estimated as @xmath57\\,{}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm sf}}{1.5\\times{}10^{-2}\\,{}{\\rm m}_\\odot{}\\,{}{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{}{\\rm mpc}^{-3}}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\\left(\\frac{t_{\\rm life}}{10",
    "^ 8{\\rm yr}}\\right)\\,{}\\left(\\frac{f_{\\rm sf}}{0.8}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the number of ns - ns binary mergers per solar mass per year and can be derived as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of ns - ns binaries that actually merged during our simulations and @xmath61 myr is the assumed ysc life ( and the duration of the simulation ) . in the case of ns - ns binaries",
    "we use the number of merged binaries ( rather than the number of expected mergers , as in the case of bh - bh binaries ) , because we have sufficient statistics to do so . at @xmath62 and 0.01",
    "z@xmath1 @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "thus , the merger rate of ns - ns binaries is @xmath64 if we assume that all yscs in the local universe formed at high metallicity ( @xmath55 , see table  [ tab : dnspeters&table ] ) , and is @xmath65 if we assume that all yscs in the local universe formed low metallicity ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "this is another important results of our simulations , as it implies that ns - ns mergers are suppressed at low metallicity .",
    "as a first - order approximation , we can assume that the merger rate of ns - ns binaries in the local universe is included in this range of values , i.e. @xmath67 . in equation  [ eq : mrgrdnsb ] , we assume that @xmath68 does not change significantly with time .",
    "this approximation is reasonable for the distance range of advanced ligo and virgo ( see the short discussion at the end of this section ) .",
    "finally , the merger rate of ns - bh binaries is @xmath69 for all considered metallicities , as we found no simulated systems with coalescence timescale shorter than the hubble time . in our simulations ,",
    "ns - bh systems are much less common than bh - bh binaries , since the latter are favoured by dynamical exchanges with respect to the former .",
    "our estimates of the merger rate show that there is a possible trend with metallicity : the mergers of ns - ns binaries are favoured at high metallicity ( @xmath70 ) , while the mergers of bh - bh binaries are more frequent at low metallicity ( @xmath71 z@xmath4 ) .",
    "we recall that @xmath24 z@xmath4 is the typical metallicity of gcs in the milky way ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath25 z@xmath4 is the metallicity of many irregular galaxies and dwarf galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. @xcite ) , while a metallicity close to solar is normally found in the bulges of giant spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a metallicity gradient ( with @xmath72 decreasing at larger distance from the centre ) has been found in most local late - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the metallicity of the local universe is quite patchy , with a preference for higher metallicity at the centre of the most massive galaxies and for lower metallicity in the outskirts of massive galaxies as well as in dwarf and irregular galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the sloan digital sky survey shows that the sf in the last gyr has a bimodal distribution : about half of it occurs at solar metallicity , while the remaining half takes place at @xmath73 z@xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that about half of the yscs that formed in the last gyr have @xmath74 z@xmath1 , while the remaining half have @xmath73 z@xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , a negligible fraction of yscs formed at @xmath24 z@xmath4 in the last gyr .",
    "if we assume ( as suggested by @xcite ) that half of the yscs that formed in the last gyr have @xmath74 z@xmath1 , while the remaining half have @xmath73 z@xmath1 , the rate of mergers we expect today from our simulated yscs ( using equations [ eq : mrgrdnsb ] and [ eq : mrgrdbhb ] ) is @xmath75 and @xmath76 , for ns - ns and bh - bh binaries , respectively .",
    "the aforementioned values of @xmath68 and @xmath36 have been derived from the typical properties of yscs in the local universe and assuming a metallicity mixture valid for the last gyr ( i.e. up to redshift @xmath77 ) .",
    "are they valid over the entire distance range of advanced ligo and virgo ? according to @xcite ,",
    "the distance range of advanced ligo and virgo will be @xmath78 mpc ( @xmath79 ) and 1 gpc ( @xmath80 ) for ns - ns and bh - bh mergers , respectively .",
    "thus , we can conclude that our estimated merger rates are fairly uniform ( within the uncertainties ) across the range of advanced ligo and virgo , especially in the case of ns - ns mergers .",
    "we recall that the dcobs that form in yscs will be ejected to the field as a consequence of evaporation , natal kicks and three - body encounters , and because of the disruption of the parent yscs by the tidal field of the host galaxy .",
    "thus , the merger rate we estimate in this section represents the expected merger rate for the field .",
    "this is very important , as previous studies estimated the merger rate either for for long - lived gcs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or for the field ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in previous work , the effect of dynamics has been included only in the estimate of the merger rate within gcs , while field binaries have been assumed to form and evolve in isolation ( through population synthesis codes ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that most stars form in yscs and evolve dynamically via three - body encounters , before being ejected into the field .",
    "our results show that the estimate of the merger rate in the field should account for dynamical evolution .",
    "[ fig : mgrcomparison ] compares our predictions of the merger rates with some of the most representative estimates available in the literature . from this figure",
    ", it is apparent that our prediction of @xmath68 is fairly consistent with the estimate derived from short gamma - ray bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , our results for @xmath68 and @xmath36 are consistent with the estimates provided in @xcite . in contrast , our results for @xmath81 are significantly lower than predicted by @xcite .",
    "we recall that the value of @xmath68 reported by @xcite is derived from the observed rate of ns - ns binaries in the milky way ( @xcite ) , while the values of @xmath81 and @xmath36 are obtained from population synthesis codes ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) and are only indirectly constrained by the sn rate .    the main differences between the approach presented in @xcite and ours are the following .",
    "( i ) the estimates presented in @xcite are based on population synthesis simulations of isolated binaries and do not account for the fact that most stars form in yscs ; ( ii ) the mass spectrum of bhs is significantly different ; ( iii ) @xcite assume that most galaxies in the local universe are milky way analogues , while in this paper we adopt the cosmic sfr by @xcite .",
    "the fact that we account for the dynamical evolution of yscs and include more massive bhs than @xcite affects the results significantly , as the formation of bh - bh binaries is enhanced with respect to that of ns - bh systems .",
    "in general , our simulated dcobs can not evolve in isolation but frequently undergo three - body encounters that perturb their orbits , while the results of @xcite are obtained assuming that all binaries evolve in isolation .",
    "recent studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite adopt a bh mass spectrum much more similar to ours and investigate the dependence of the merger rate on metallicity , even if they do not include three - body encounters . as a consequence ,",
    "the distribution of bh - bh binary chirp masses in the three aforementioned papers is very similar to our distribution .",
    "the main difference is the absence of massive bhs that come from a merger in the papers by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , because they do not allow merged binaries to acquire a new companion dynamically .    in their standard model ,",
    "@xcite find an estimate of @xmath68 that is fairly consistent with ours , while their prediction for @xmath81 and @xmath36 are about a factor of ten higher . in addiction ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite present an alternative model in which common envelope ( ce ) phases on the hertzsprung gap are allowed ( i.e. the binary is not assumed to merge when one of the two members reaches the hertzsprung gap ) .",
    "the merger rates obtained with this assumption are a factor of @xmath82 higher than our results .",
    "this discrepancy is consistent with our expectations , as our simulations adopt the same recipes for the ce phase as in the standard model of @xcite to model the ce phase ( see @xcite for a definition ) , and we assume that all binaries that enter a ce phase when at least one of the two members is in the hertzsprung gap merge . ] .",
    "@xcite study the merger rate of dcobs in gcs and in the field by means of monte carlo simulations and population synthesis models , respectively .",
    "they find that ns - ns binaries and ns - bh binaries should dominate the dcob population in the field , whereas bh - bh binaries are the main merger candidates in gcs .",
    "we confirm their result , in the sense that the formation of bh - bh binaries is enhanced by dynamics in star clusters .",
    "our results agree with those of @xcite also for the importance of dynamical exchanges : @xcite find that 6 per cent ( 94 per cent ) of bh - bh binary merger candidates come from primordial binaries ( dynamical exchanges ) , while we find that 1.7 per cent of our bh - bh binaries come from primordial binaries .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite neglect the fact that many of the merger candidates in the field have been ejected from yscs ( by dynamical ejection , natal kick or ysc disruption ) .",
    "accounting for field dcobs that were ejected from yscs increases the relative importance of bh - bh binaries in the field , especially at low metallicity .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find a merger rate @xmath83 mpc@xmath84 myr @xmath85 in dense star clusters , substantially higher than our result ( @xmath86 mpc@xmath84 myr @xmath85 ) , because they assume that the bhs remain in dynamical equilibrium with the rest of the cluster .",
    "this suppresses the dynamical ejection of bhs .",
    "other recent papers ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) focus on dcob merger in dense stellar systems and gcs . in particular , @xcite perform monte carlo simulations of gcs in which they assume that the bh population is concentrated in the core and dynamically decoupled from the rest of the cluster , because of the spitzer instability ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite find that most bh - bh binaries are ejected from the parent star cluster and that the resulting merger rate is @xmath87 mpc@xmath84 myr @xmath85 , much lower than in @xcite , because of the assumed spitzer instability .",
    "the merger rate estimated by @xcite is very similar to our result .",
    "@xcite and @xcite perform monte carlo simulations of gcs .",
    "they ( i ) include a treatment of metallicity that is close to ours ( even if their maximum bh mass is generally lower than ours , as they use the same distribution as in @xcite ) , ( ii ) assume neither spitzer instability nor rigid equilibrium between the bhs and the rest of the cluster _ a priori_. @xcite find that the bhs strongly mass segregate and evolve similarly to what assumed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite find an even lower merger rate than the one derived by @xcite and by our paper , but they admit that this may be due to their approximate treatment of three - body encounters . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of orbital periods in the simulations by @xcite is similar to ours ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vorbprophist ] ) .",
    "furthermore , both this paper and @xcite find that most bh - bh binaries form dynamically , through exchanges .",
    "finally , @xcite find that bh - bh binaries form earlier and are more stable at low metallicity , because bhs are more massive , in agreement with our results ( see figures [ fig : vcountintime ] and [ fig : lifetimes ] ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results confirm that most bh - bh binaries in star clusters come from dynamical exchanges , in agreement with the findings of monte carlo simulations of dense star clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our simulated star clusters are a factor of @xmath88 less massive and a factor of @xmath89 smaller than those studied in previous work ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , they are expected to be much more numerous in the local universe than those considered by previous work ( since the mass function of yscs scales as @xmath90 , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical evolution timescale of our simulated yscs is much shorter , as @xmath91 .",
    "thus , most dcobs that form in our simulated yscs will be ejected to the field ( by ysc evaporation , three - body encounters or tidal fields ) , over a timescale much shorter than found in previous work .",
    "therefore , our yscs can be considered the building blocks of the galaxy disc , and the merger rate we have estimated represents the expected merger rate of the field population .",
    "we studied the impact of metallicity and dynamics on the formation and evolution of dcobs .",
    "to this purpose , we have run 600 n - body realizations of yscs chosen to match the properties of the most common yscs in our galaxy",
    ". we simulated yscs , because most stars form in yscs .",
    "thus , we can not study the formation and evolution of dcobs without accounting for the fact that most of them originate in yscs .    for our simulations , we used an upgraded version of the public code starlab , which includes recipes for metallicity - dependent stellar evolution and winds , and which allows stars with final mass larger than @xmath92 to directly collapse to a bh .",
    "direct collapse leads to the formation of massive stellar bhs ( @xmath93 ) at low metallicity .",
    "we found that , while the number of nss is about four times larger than the number of bhs , the number of bh - bh binaries is about ten times higher than the number of ns - ns binaries .",
    "the reason is that dynamical interactions enhance the formation of bh - bh binaries with respect to ns - ns binaries .",
    "heavier bhs sink to the centre of the ysc , where they are more likely to interact with other bhs : bhs can acquire companions through three - body exchanges . since the probability of a dynamical exchange is higher when the single star is more massive than one of the members of the binary and since bhs are among the most massive objects in a ysc , exchanges favour the formation of bh - bh binaries .",
    "bh - bh binaries form earlier at low metallicity , because bhs are more massive in metal - poor yscs . furthermore ,",
    "bh - bh binaries formed at low metallicity are more stable : they live longer than bh - bh binaries in metal - rich yscs .",
    "the simulated bh - bh binaries have very large chirp masses ( @xmath94 m@xmath1 ) , because of the direct collapse at low metallicity and because mergers between stars and bhs are allowed .",
    "bh - bh binaries span a wide range in periods ( @xmath2 yr ) .",
    "in contrast , most ns - ns binaries have periods @xmath95 yr . as a consequence , the coalescence timescale is generally longer for bh - bh binaries than for ns - ns binaries .",
    "the minimum coalescence timescale for bh - bh binaries and ns - ns binaries is @xmath26 gyr and @xmath27 gyr , respectively .",
    "only 7 bh - bh binaries are expected to merge within a hubble time .",
    "moreover , no bh - bh binaries merge during our simulations , while 11 ns - ns binaries do .    from our simulations , we can estimate the merger rate of dcobs in the local universe .",
    "we find a merger rate @xmath96 , @xmath69 and @xmath97 for bh - bh , ns - bh and ns - ns binaries , respectively .",
    "the merger rate of ns - ns binaries is fairly consistent with the estimates based on both the observed galactic ns - ns binaries ( @xcite ) and the observed rate of short gamma - ray bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "the merger rate of bh - bh binaries is consistent with recent monte carlo simulations of dense star clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the merger rate of ns - bh binaries is quite low with respect to previous estimates based on population synthesis codes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this can be explained with the fact that the formation of ns - bh binaries is less favoured by dynamical exchanges than the formation of bh - bh binaries .",
    "our merger rates are still affected by a number of assumptions that will be improved in forthcoming studies .",
    "first , in our study we assume that the lifetime of the simulated yscs is 100 myr , but we do not take into account the presence of a realistic galactic tidal field .",
    "second , we explore only a limited portion of the parameter space . in forthcoming studies",
    ", we will consider yscs with different concentration , half - mass radius , total mass and binary fraction .",
    "our simulated yscs are expected to dissolve in the galactic disc in @xmath98 myr , that is much shorter than the coalescence timescale of all bh - bh binaries and of some ns - ns binaries .",
    "the dcobs that form within the simulated yscs are ejected in the field ( due to three - body interactions or because of the disruption of the parent ysc ) . once in the field",
    ", the dcobs will not undergo more dynamical interactions and will continue their evolution in isolation , until they merge .",
    "thus , the mergers of ( most ) our simulated dcobs are expected to take place in the field .",
    "accounting for the fact that most dcobs form in yscs and evolve through dynamical interactions is a crucial step towards obtaining a realistic description of the demographics of dcobs , in light of the forthcoming advanced ligo and virgo scientific runs .",

    "as we mentioned in section  [ sec : dbhpopulation ] , in our paper a binary system is defined as a bound pair , i.e. the most general possible definition . on the other hand ,",

    "we consider stable and unstable binaries separately .",

    "it is remarkable that bh - bh binaries are at least ten times more numerous than ns - ns and ns - bh binaries , when considering both the stable binary sample and the unstable binary sample .",
    "this shows that dynamics has a strong impact on the population of dcobs , regardless of the distinction between stable and unstable binaries .",
    "it is also worth noting that we have found no unstable ns - ns binaries .",

    "the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : appendixdistro ] shows the distribution of bh - bh binaries per ysc ( integrated over the simulation time ) . here , the difference between stable and unstable binaries is quite marked : a single ysc can host up to @xmath103 unstable binaries , but only up to @xmath104 stable binaries . fig .",
    "[ fig : appendixtime ] compares the average number of bh - bh binaries per ysc as a function of time for stable ( top ) and unstable ( bottom ) binaries .",
    "it is worth noting that unstable binaries peak at @xmath105 , i.e. immediately after the core collapse : it is reasonable to expect that the formation of loose binaries is triggered by the increase of the central density due to the core collapse phase ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the number of stable binaries steadily increases with time ( because they tend to survive for a longer time , after their formation ) .",
    "the differences among metallicities that we discussed in section  [ sec : dbhpopulation ] still hold , when considering stable and unstable binaries separately .",
    "[ fig : appendixsma ] shows the distribution of semi - major axes of bh - bh , ns - ns and ns - bh binaries at @xmath25 z@xmath4 , distinguishing between stable ( top ) and unstable ( bottom ) binaries . as it is reasonable to expect , most unstable ( stable ) binaries have semi - major axes @xmath106 au ( @xmath107 au ) . however , there are also some unstable binaries with @xmath108 smaller than that of stable binaries .",
    "the reason is that the stability criterion depends not only on the separation of the two objects , but also on their mass ( in this sense , it is a hardness criterion ) and eccentricity .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : appendixsma ] , the most loose unstable binaries have semi - major axes as large as @xmath109 au , that is @xmath110 pc ( similar to the initial ysc tidal radius ) , with periods comparable to the initial central two - body relaxation time ( @xmath111 10 myr , see also fig .",

    "these extremely loose bound pairs are very short - lived : it is reasonable to expect that they would completely disappear , if a galactic tidal field would be included in our simulations .",
    "on the other hand , these highly unstable systems are completely negligible from the point of view of gw sources .",
    "[ fig : appendixgw ] confirms that unstable dcobs are completely negligible from the point of view of gw emission : their coalescence timescale is by orders of magnitude longer than the hubble time .",
