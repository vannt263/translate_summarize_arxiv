    "in our recent publication @xcite we have considered the associated production of charged gauge bosons @xmath4 and charged charmed mesons @xmath5 at the lhc and came to the conclusion that same - sign @xmath6 events could serve as an indicator of double parton interactions @xcite .",
    "our consideration was only restricted to the central region , i.e. to cms @xcite and atlas @xcite kinematic conditions , since these were the only collaborations who provided the data ( though not on same - sign @xmath7 configurations ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the lhcb collaboration is going to measure the production cross sections for all of the four @xmath7 charge combinations .",
    "now , we feel it very tempting to foreshadow the experimental measurement with a theoretical prediction .",
    "the planned work needs to be done with care , since the momentum conservation requirement in the large-@xmath8 region may spoil the factorization hypothesis commonly used in double parton scattering ( dps ) calculations .",
    "this motivates us to introduce certain corrections to the theory .",
    "we also wish to extend our analysis to the production of @xmath9 states .",
    "the latter is closely similar to the @xmath7 case in its part , but the background coming from single parton scattering ( sps ) is rather different and awaits a special survey .",
    "our previous calculation @xcite was done in the @xmath10-factorization technique , but in the present paper we adopt ` combined ' approach .",
    "that is , the production of heavy systems like @xmath11 or @xmath12 bosons as well as their sps production in association with heavy quarks is done in the traditional collinear scheme , while the @xmath10-factorization is used for solely produced @xmath13 or @xmath14 pairs ( the latter constitute one branch of a double parton interaction ) .",
    "then we benefit from easily including higher - order radiative corrections which are taken into account in the form of @xmath10-dependent parton densities .",
    "thus , we rely on a combination of two techniques , with each of them being used at the kinematics where it is most suitable ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 at large @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 at small @xmath8 ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we reconsider the dps formalism in the forward ( lhcb ) kinematics and introduce corrections matching the momentum conservation requirement .",
    "then we test our theory by applying it to the associated @xmath0 production , where the existing data @xcite form grounds for a comparison .",
    "we further use the corrected formalism to make predictions on the charm - associated @xmath4 production in sec .",
    "iii and on the beauty - associated @xmath4 production in sec .",
    "our findings are summarized in sec .",
    "as far as the sps contributions are concerned , the calculations are straightforward and need no special explanation . throughout this paper ,",
    "all calculations are based on the following parameter setting .",
    "we employ the approach @xcite for relatively light states ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) and collinear factorization for states containing @xmath11 or @xmath12 bosons .",
    "we used kimner - martin - ryskin @xcite parametrization for unintegrated quark and gluon distributions with martin - stirling - thorne - watt ( mstw ) @xcite collinear densities taken as input ( or pure mstw densities for collinear calculations ) ; we used running strong and electroweak coupling constants normalized to @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; the factorization and renormalization scales were chosen as @xmath18=@xmath19=@xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 or @xmath23 for all processes involving @xmath11 and @xmath12 bosons , and @xmath18=@xmath19=@xmath24 for the production of sole @xmath25 pairs ( @xmath26 ) ; the quark masses were set to @xmath27  gev , @xmath28  gev , @xmath29  gev , @xmath30- and @xmath31-quarks were converted into @xmath32 and @xmath3 mesons using the peterson fragmentation function @xcite with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , and normalized to @xmath35 @xcite , @xmath36=0.40 and @xmath37=0.40 .",
    "our choice of renormalization scale is slightly different from the conventional one by using @xmath38 rather than @xmath39 , but we then can fit the experimental data ( see below , eqs .",
    "( 4),(15),(22 ) ; otherwise , with @xmath18=@xmath40 , the calculations would lie slightly below the data points ) .",
    "we do not mind developing here a rigorous theory of heavy quark production , but are rather interested in understanding the relative importance of the different contributions .",
    "our simple prescription would suffice for that purpose .    to calculate the dps contributions one commonly makes use of a simple factorization formula ( for details see the reviews @xcite and references therein ) , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a normalization constant that encodes all `` dps unknowns '' into a single phenomenological parameter . deriving",
    "this formula relies on two simplifying approximations : that ( i ) the double parton distribution functions can be decomposed into longitudinal and transverse components , and ( ii ) the longitudinal component @xmath43 reduces to the diagonal product of two independent single parton distribution functions : @xmath44 ( here @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the longitudinal momentum fractions of the partons @xmath47 and @xmath48 entering the hard subprocesses at the probing scales @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "the latter approximation is acceptable for such collider experiments where only small @xmath8 values are probed ; however , this can not be said of the lhcb conditions , especially with respect to heavy systems as electroweak bosons . at the lhcb conditions ,",
    "the probed @xmath8 values are not far from the phase space boundary where the evident restriction on the total parton momentum @xmath51 violates the dps factorization ansatz .",
    "setting the boundary condition in the form of theta - function @xmath52 would result in a steplike discontinuity at the edge of the phase space .",
    "this does not seem physically consistent for the parton densities . in a more accurate approach @xcite , @xmath53 the kinematical constraints",
    "are smoothly put into play with the correction factor @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a parameter to be fixed phenomenologically .",
    "the integrand and its derivative remain continuous at the phase space border .",
    "one often chooses n=2 .",
    "this choice of the phase space factor can be partly justified  @xcite in the framework of perturbative qcd and gives double parton distribution functions which satisfy the momentum sum rules  @xcite reasonably well . to feel the size of the possible effect we also tried @xmath56 .",
    "the case of unconstrained phase space is presented in table  i as @xmath57",
    ". a numerical value of @xmath58 15 mb has earlier been obtained empirically from fits to @xmath59 and @xmath60 data .",
    "this will be taken as the default value throughout the paper .",
    "as we will see , variations within some reasonable range @xmath58 15 @xmath61 5 mb would affect our dps predictions ( with the respective errors presented in the tables ) , though without changing our basic conclusions .",
    "now we are ready to compare predictions with the data . for the lhcb fiducial phase space @xcite",
    "we obtain @xmath62 in excellent agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , reporting @xmath63 .",
    "as the experimental statistics is very limited ( 7 @xmath64 events and 4 @xmath65 events ) it is more reasonable not to consider the @xmath64 and @xmath65 cross sections separately , but rather to rely on the sum of them . taken separately , the @xmath64 and @xmath65 data are at variance with other measurements .",
    "there exist independent publications @xcite ( including the one by lhcb collaboration ) which all agree with each other showing the ratio @xmath66 , in contrast with @xmath67 seen in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the authors of @xcite seem to greatly underestimate their statistical errors .",
    "so , we calculate the @xmath68 production cross section at the quark level and then convert @xmath30-quarks into @xmath69 and @xmath32 mesons with the overall probability normalised to 85% ( with the remaining 15% left for @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "we estimate the yields from the different subprocesses as @xmath72 summing up and multiplying by the quark fragmentation probability and by the @xmath73 branching fraction we arrive at @xmath74 pb . this result is consistent with the theoretical calculation presented in @xcite under the name of ` mcfm massive ' .",
    "adding the dps contribution in the form ( [ doubleab ] ) gives @xmath75 pb , which significantly exceeds the data .",
    "after applying the correction factor ( [ dxdr ] ) the agreement becomes rather satisfactory ( see table i ) .",

    "the sps and dps contributions are shown separately , with @xmath80 indicating the power of the correction factor in eq.([dxdr ] ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the production of @xmath81 states is dominated by the quark - gluon scattering at @xmath82 @xmath83 where the main role belongs to strange quarks , @xmath84 . among the variety of processes contributing to both and same - sign @xmath7 states ,",
    "the most important ones are the quark - antiquark annihilation at @xmath85 , @xmath86 and quark - gluon scattering at @xmath87 , @xmath88 in addition to that , there present indirect contributions from the production of top - quark pairs @xmath89 followed by a long chain of decays : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath93 ( and the charge conjugated modes ) .",
    "all other possible processes are suppressed by extra powers of coupling constants or by kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix .",
    "subprocesses @xmath94 and @xmath95 , though formally of the same order as ( [ qq2wcc ] ) , are heavily suppressed by the gluon propagator having vitrtuality of order @xmath96 rather than @xmath97 .",
    "our parameter setting was basically described in sec .",
    "ii . for the indirect contributions we also assumed @xmath98 branching fraction for @xmath99 and used the inclusive branching fractions @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 listed in the particle data book @xcite .",

    "associated @xmath9 production is not simply a repetition of the @xmath7 case with a different quark mass .",
    "indeed , the contributing parton subprocesses are significantly different .",
    "first , there is no analog to process ( [ gq2wc ] ) , as the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa couplings of a @xmath31-quark to the quarks of two lighter generations are really negligible .",

    "we find it worth saying a few words on the specific properties of sps and dps kinematics at the lhcb conditions .",
    "parton momentum configurations in the sps channels are very asymmetric . to produce a heavy @xmath136 system with both @xmath11 and @xmath31 having large positive rapidity",
    ", the positive light - cone momentum fraction of the incoming parton must be large .",
    "on the average , valence @xmath137 quarks carry larger @xmath8 than valence @xmath138 quarks , thus favoring the production of @xmath139 in comparison with @xmath2 bosons in subprocesses ( [ qq2wbb ] ) and ( [ gq2qwbb ] ) .",
    "this property is illustrated in figs . 1 , 2 .",
    "sea quarks are mainly concentrated in the small-@xmath8 region and can not contribute at a significant level .",
    "in general , the desired large positive light - cone momentum is easier to get with two independent partons in dps than with a single parton in sps .",
