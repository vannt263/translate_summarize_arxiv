    "during recent years , studies on the growth of phthalocyanine ( pc ) films on different surfaces , especially metallic substrates have become a major field for the surface science and organic electronic communities .",
    "these molecules can create self - assembled layers , which make the thin - film processing very convenient@xcite .",
    "phthalocyanines are synthetic macrocyclic compounds , constructed of four lobes ; each lobe is composed of one pyrrole and one benzene group .",
    "metal - free phthalocyanine ( h@xmath2pc ) is noted as h@xmath2c@xmath3n@xmath4h@xmath5 .",
    "the flexibility of this molecule provides an opportunity to replace the two central h atoms with a metallic atom ( @xmath6pc ) ( a metal - oxygen or metal - halogen can also be inserted into the pc center ) .",
    "this property has made these molecules very attractive for research , since electronic , optical , physical and magnetic properties of pcs can be tuned by changing the metallic center  @xcite . in particular , research on transition - metal phthalocyanines has received lots of attention , owing to the significant effect of the @xmath7 orbitals on molecular properties  @xcite .",
    "these intrinsically semiconducting molecules , show very high thermal ( stable up to @xmath8c ) and chemical stability in addition to their electronic , optical and magnetic properties .",
    "these characteristics make @xmath6pc a promising candidate to be used in organic solar cells  @xcite , organic light - emitting diodes ( oleds )  @xcite and organic field - effect transistors ( ofets)@xcite . the function of these devices is influenced by another essential factor : interaction and charge transfer at the interface between @xmath6pc and substrate .",
    "numerous studies , applying several experimental and theoretical methods , have been carried out to investigate the interfacial interaction and charge transfer , as well as the effect of these interactions on the device functionality .",
    "interaction at the interface between @xmath6pc and substrate determines the layer growth mode , molecular configuration , charge transfer , magnetic and optical properties of the molecular layer , which could effectively modify the organic device function .",
    "this has encouraged many groups to investigate the effect of substrate - adsorbate interaction on the properties of the molecular layer and consequently the potential devices which would have organic components of similar nature  @xcite .",
    "manipulation of the @xmath6pc - substrate interaction is possible by either decorating the molecules ( adding external atoms or molecules to the center or the periphery of pcs )  @xcite , by modifying the substrate by inserting intermediate layers  @xcite , or by adding layers on top of @xmath6pc  @xcite .",
    "for instance , upon adsorption of pyridine on an ordered layer of fepc on au(111 ) , pyridine molecules coordinate to the iron .",
    "this coordination leads to a strong ligand field which modifies the magnetic and electronic properties of the iron atom  @xcite .",
    "in another study , gerlach _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that by fluorination of cupc adsorbed on cu(111 ) and ag(111 ) , the molecular distortion and interfacial interactions are modified . due to the interaction with the substrate",
    ", cupc is adsorbed non - planar on these substrates , yet parallel to the sample surface in both cases .",
    "they reported that fluorination resulted in a reduction of the molecule - substrate attraction and consequently a more `` planar '' molecular configuration , with the molecular layer further away from the substrate .",
    "bending of @xmath6pc molecules on different substrates has been reported , which generally comes together with an inhomogeneous charge transfer at the interface between molecule and substrate  @xcite .    in this article , we have studied the electronic structure of znpc on pt(111 ) and on two iodine - induced surface structures , from sub - monolayer to thick films .",
    "the spectroscopy experiments were done at beamline d1011 , at max - lab , swedish national synchrotron radiation laboratory .",
    "d1011 is a bending - magnet beamline which offers photons in the energy range @xmath9  ev to @xmath10  ev selected by a modified sx-700 plane grating monochromator  @xcite .",
    "the experimental system consists of separate analysis and preparation chambers accessible via a long - travel manipulator .",
    "the photoelectron spectra were measured using a scienta ses200 ( upgraded ) electron energy analyzer .",
    "the binding energy of all photoelectron spectra is calibrated with respect to the fermi level , measured directly on the pt sample .",
    "these spectra are normalized to the background at the low - binding - energy side of the core - level spectra .",
    "the total experimental resolution for core - level spectra are @xmath11  mev ( @xmath12  ev , n@xmath13 ) , @xmath14  mev ( @xmath15  ev , c@xmath13 ) , @xmath16  mev ( @xmath17  ev , pt@xmath18 ) and @xmath19  mev ( @xmath20  ev , i@xmath21 and zn@xmath22 ) .",
    "the photoelectron spectra are obtained at normal emission .",
    "numerical curve fitting is done using donjiac - unji line profiles , which includes a lorentzian broadening ( @xmath23 ) from the finite core - hole life time , a gaussian broadening ( @xmath24 ) from limited experimental resolution and sample inhomogeneities and an asymmetry ( @xmath25 ) on the high binding energy side due to excitation of electrons across the fermi level  @xcite .    for pt@xmath18 best fits",
    "were obtained with @xmath26  ev , @xmath27  ev and @xmath28 , while these numbers are @xmath29  ev , @xmath30  ev and @xmath31 for c@xmath13 and @xmath32  ev , @xmath33  ev as well as @xmath31 for n@xmath13 . to fit i@xmath21 we use spin - orbit doublets , with a branching ratio ( br ) of @xmath34 ,",
    "a spin - orbit split ( so ) of @xmath35  ev , @xmath36  ev , @xmath37  ev and @xmath38 .",
    "xas were collected at the nitrogen k - edge in total electron yield ( tey ) mode using an mcp detector .",
    "the photon energies were calibrated using the kinetic - energy difference in the pt@xmath18 peak measured by first- and second - order light .",
    "the absorption spectra were normalized to the spectrum of a clean sample .",
    "xas were taken at three different angles between the surface plane and the electric - field vector : @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the preparation chamber is equipped with an ion sputtering gun , low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) optics , a gas - inlet system and ports for evaporators .",
    "the base pressure in this chamber was lower than @xmath42  mbar .",
    "the pt(111 ) single crystal was purchased from http://www.spl.eu/[surface preparation laboratory , the netherlands ] . before the measurements ,",
    "the pt sample was prepared by cycles of ar sputtering , annealing in o@xmath2 atmosphere and subsequently flashing at higher temperature .",
    "ar sputtering was done at @xmath43  mbar , for @xmath16 minutes ; annealing in oxygen was done at @xmath43  mbar while the sample was heated to @xmath44  k. after annealing , the sample was flashed at @xmath45  k. a few cleaning cycles were needed to attain a clean and organized surface . the cleanliness of the sample was confirmed by wide - range pes tracing any expected impurities and eventually finding none .",
    "the clean sample showed a sharp @xmath46 leed pattern .",
    "iodine was deposited on the surface from an electrochemical cell .",
    "in this cell an agi pellet is heated to about @xmath47  k. an ionic current flows through the cell ( @xmath48a in this case ) and i@xmath2 molecules are emitted into the chamber . a @xmath16-minutes iodine deposition on pt(111 ) results in a @xmath49 reconstruction , confirmed by leed and i@xmath21 photoelectron spectra",
    "heating this saturated iodine layer , at @xmath50  k it transforms into a @xmath51 structure , also confirmed by leed and i@xmath21 core - level spectra .",
    "the znpc layers were prepared by sublimation from a quartz crucible with a diameter of about @xmath52  mm , after degassing for more than @xmath53  h. the monolayers of znpc were obtained by deposition on the substrate kept at room temperature .",
    "the molecules were purchased from http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/[sigma-aldrich ] ( @xmath54  % dye content ; the remaining @xmath55  % consisted mainly of water , which was removed by the long outgassing ) .",
    "the thickness of the znpc layer was estimated from the attenuation of the pt@xmath18 signal and the increase of the n@xmath13 and c@xmath13 signals . at sufficiently large thickness",
    "it is reasonable to apply an exponential attenuation model .",
    "the coverage 1  ml refers to the number of molecules needed to cover the pt(111 ) surface , and 6  ml refers to a six times higher surface coverage , without implying any particular growth mode .",
    "we also compare with other similar systems measured on the same beamline .",
    "the method is not exact and the values we give are therefore approximate .",
    "stm experiments were done in a rhk 3500 uhv stm ( in a different system from the photoemission experiments ) using mechanically cut pt - ir tips in constant - current mode .",
    "the sample was prepared in a preparation chamber connected to the stm chamber via a gate valve .",
    "this chamber is also equipped with leed optics , an ar - ion sputter gun and sample heating .",
    "the sample was mounted on a mo sample holder .",
    "the sample temperature was measured with chromel - alumel thermocouples , spot - welded on the side of the sample or by a pyrometer .",
    "in this section the experimental results from znpc on pt(111 ) are presented .",
    "below , absorption spectra and core - level photoemission spectra from different steps of the znpc deposition on pt are shown and the effect of znpc adsorption on the substrate , as well as reactions at the interface and within the molecular layers is discussed .",
    "stm images are also presented from znpc layers adsorbed on pt(111 ) .",
    "x - ray absorption spectra measured from a monolayer ( ml ) and a thick film ( tf ) of znpc on pt(111 ) at 3 different angles are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "a ml refers to the coverage , in which tightly - packed , flat - lying molecules would cover the entire surface  @xcite ; the coverage for a tf here is about 10 mls .",
    "the xas measurement angles are : @xmath56 ( normal incidence ) , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( grazing incidence ) , where @xmath59 is the angle between the electric - field vector and the surface plane . in the orbital configuration of phthalocyanines @xmath60 orbitals extend normal to the molecular plane and @xmath61 orbitals lie in the molecular plane . in the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , excitation into the @xmath62 states are seen as peaks between @xmath63  ev and @xmath64  ev photon energy , while excitation into the @xmath65 states appears at photon energies above @xmath66  ev  @xcite .",
    "the multiplot demonstrates that molecules are lying almost parallel to pt(111 ) in the monolayer , while they are slightly tilted in the thick film",
    ".    a closer look at the n k - edge spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] discloses a shoulder - like peak on the lower photon energy side of the first resonance associated to excitation into the lumo in the ml spectra [ marked in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] ] , especially visible in the spectra measured at @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "another noticeable change is the variation in the relative intensity of the peaks in each spectrum going from the ml to the tf .",
    "a similar behavior was observed for fepc adsorbed on ag(111 ) but interestingly not for fepc on au(100 )  @xcite .",
    "a splitting of the first resonance is caused by a hybridization of nitrogen orbitals and metal - related states .",
    "spectra recorded from pt(111)-znpc after different preparations . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , pt@xmath18 photoemission spectra from different sample preparations are presented .",
    "the lowermost spectrum is measured from clean pt(111 ) and comprises two peaks : the bulk peak at @xmath67  ev and the surface peak located at a @xmath68  ev lower be , in good agreement with previous studies  @xcite .",
    "upon adsorption of znpc the surface peak loses intensity drastically and is further reduced at higher coverage , unlike the znpc / au(111 ) system , where even at a high coverage , the surface peak keeps its intensity  @xcite .",
    "another difference compared to au(111 ) is that after adsorption of znpc on pt(111 ) , a new peak ( c ) appears at higher be .",
    "the appearance of the new chemically shifted peak at @xmath69 following adsorption of organic molecules has been reported previously ; e.g. for propene and ethylidine : @xmath70  ev , 2-butenal : @xmath71  ev and cch@xmath72 : @xmath73  ev are observed  @xcite .",
    "adsorption of other molecules such as co  @xcite and o@xmath2  @xcite also resulted in adsorption - induced chemical shifts up to @xmath74  ev , depending on the coverage .",
    "our observation indicates that znpc is chemisorbed on pt(111 ) .",
    "the total integrated area under s and c remains roughly at a value which is comparable with the area under the surface peak of the clean surface . even at the highest coverage , s has @xmath75  % relative intensity , meaning that some surface atoms are untouched by the adsorbate layer .",
    "the initial surface peak represents one monolayer of pt , contributing to @xmath76  % of the total pt@xmath18 intensity .",
    "thus , @xmath75  % represents @xmath77 ml of surface atoms .",
    "_ showed that the @xmath78 symmetry of the molecule is responsible for the vanishing intrinsic electrostatic moment  @xcite , giving weak intermolecular forces where the favorable adsorption positions are determined mainly by the interaction of molecules with the substrate  @xcite . however , in our case the chemisorption bond will lead to local geometric and/or electronic `` deformation '' of both substrate and molecule , which as previously shown will create a substrate - mediated intermolecular repulsion  @xcite .",
    ".[tab : i ] pt@xmath79 curve - fitting results . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our results do not provide sufficient evidence that a bending of the molecular plane is the only reason for the site - dependent charge distribution in the molecules .",
    "hence , we also discuss the other possibility , the effect of different wave - function overlap for the different atoms of the molecule with the substrate .",
    "our pt@xmath18 and zn@xmath22 photoemission results confirm zn - pt interaction at the interface .",
    "moreover , xas displayed that nitrogen atoms are involved in the interaction between the molecules and the substrate .",
    "this is in agreement with the results from the fepc / ag(111 ) system , where fe l - edge and n k - edge xas confirmed that both fe and n atoms are involved in the interfacial interaction  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the splitting of the first resonance and the change of the line shape were not observed for fepc / au(100 ) , indicating that n is less involved in the bond to au than to ag  @xcite .",
    "other studies are in line with this ; for fepc on au(111 )  @xcite and on au(110 )  @xcite , the metal @xmath7-states on the central atom are the main molecular contributor to the molecule - surface bond .    altogether , our core - level - spectroscopy results suggest a non - planar molecular configuration for znpc on pt(111 ) , induced by an attractive zn - pt interaction .",
    "it is shown that znpc molecules do not form a complete monolayer on a pt surface . instead , upon increasing the coverage ( up to 1 ml ) , a surface - mediated intermolecular repulsion forces znpc into multilayers .",
    "the molecules are lying almost parallel to the substrate at lower coverage , while they prefer a tilted position for a higher coverage , due to the decrease of the molecule - substrate interactions .",
    "our photoemission results illustrate that znpc is practically decoupled from pt , starting from the second layer .",
    "adsorption of iodine on pt(111 ) leads to two different reconstructions : @xmath51 at 1/3 ml and @xmath49 at 3/7 ml iodine coverage  @xcite . in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "iodine occupies three - fold hollow sites  @xcite . for the @xmath1 reconstruction , both fcc and hcp hollow sites together with the top sites",
    "are occupied  @xcite .",
    "pt@xmath18 photoemission spectra from the pt(111)-i surfaces together with their numerical fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "these spectra were measured before and after znpc adsorption , as indicated in the figure . the bottom spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig:5a ] , from @xmath0 before znpc deposition , consists of two peaks : the bulk peak at @xmath80  ev and the surface - induced peak at @xmath81  ev .",
    "the surface shift is @xmath82  ev . the relative surface intensity is @xmath83  % . for the @xmath1 surface",
    "the spectrum is practically the same despite the different surface order and different adsorption geometries ; the surface shift is @xmath84  ev and the relative intensity is @xmath83  % .",
    "the top spectra in each panel were recorded after adsorption of znpc .",
    "there are no observable changes in either of the spectra .",
    "the surface shifts and the relative surface intensity remain unaltered .",
    "this shows that the znpc does not affect pt when an iodine layer is present .",

    "they were measured at the same three angles as for the bare pt substrate above .",
    "on @xmath0 the angular dependence of the @xmath62 and @xmath65 intensities implies a flat lying geometry at ml coverage . at increasing coverage",
    "the molecules adopt a slightly tilted geometry . on @xmath1",
    "the monolayer also appears to lie down flat on the surface and keep this orientation at higher coverage",
    ". a closer look at the first resonance reveals that the extra shoulder on the low - photon - energy side observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] is not present here , indicating that n is less involved in the interfacial interactions than on pt(111 ) .",

    "[ fig:8a ] . the same two components ( c@xmath88 and c@xmath89 ) obtained for the thick film on the @xmath90 surface can be fitted to all spectra .",
    "there is practically no coverage - dependent shift .",

    "the n@xmath13 spectra are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:8b ] . again , and",
    "similar to the c@xmath13 and zn@xmath22 levels , there is no coverage - dependent shift ; the binding energy is stable at @xmath91  ev .",
    "the low - coverage binding energies of n@xmath13 and c@xmath13 are just a little smaller than the low - coverage results from @xmath90 , whereas for zn@xmath22 the difference is larger .",
    "c@xmath13 and n@xmath13 spectra from znpc on @xmath1 are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:8c ] and  [ fig:8d ] , respectively . at the lowest coverage ,",
    "the binding energies are lower than for @xmath0 . however , with increasing thickness , both c@xmath13 and n@xmath13 shift to higher binding energies .",
    "the curve fitting reveals the presence of different components in the first layer , b@xmath92 , p@xmath92 and n@xmath92 , and components from the growing film , ( b@xmath2 , p@xmath2 and n@xmath2 ) .",
    "these interface components together with the coverage - dependent shift suggest a charge transfer from the substrate to the molecules .",
    "the coverage - dependent shifts are @xmath93  ev for benzene carbon , @xmath94  ev for pyrrole carbon and @xmath93  ev for nitrogen , thus very close to the zn@xmath22 shift of @xmath87  ev .",
    "on pt(111 ) a pt - zn mediated interaction , including charge transfer and a deformation of the molecular plane , was suggested , based on different thickness dependent shifts . for both iodine substrates ,",
    "the thickness - dependent shifts are about the same for all atoms , in strong contrast to the findings on pt(111 ) ( see table  [ tab : ii ] ) , indicating a homogeneous charge distribution and charge transfer screening .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath0 there is no coverage dependent shift at all .",
    "the origin of the coverage dependent shift is a reduced screening of the core hole when the distance to the surface increases . obviously , the charge transport time to the core hole depends on the conductivity of the organic film , which apparently is higher on @xmath0 than on @xmath1 than on @xmath90 .",
    "the conductivity can have different origins ; structure within the film  @xcite and doping or perhaps a combination .",
    "the i@xmath21 spectra , together with their numerical fits are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra are presented in the left panel and from @xmath1 in the right panel .",
    "the amount of deposited znpc is indicated in the figure .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum is fitted with one spin - orbit doublet , i@xmath92 at @xmath95  ev ( i@xmath96 ) , representing hollow site iodine , while the @xmath1 spectrum holds two clearly separate components ( i@xmath92 and i@xmath2 ) at @xmath97  ev and @xmath98  ev binding energies .",
    "i@xmath92 represents hollow - site iodine and i@xmath2 represents top - site iodine .",
    "this shift has been observed previously  @xcite and it was explained as being essentially due to the distance between the iodine adatom and the surface rather than the ionicity / charge on the adatom  @xcite .",
    "the adsorption of znpc induces changes in i@xmath21 spectra from both surfaces . on @xmath1 i@xmath92",
    "narrows and shifts slightly to higher binding energy .",
    "i@xmath2 shifts closer to i@xmath92 , i.e. even more to higher binding energy and is also reduced in intensity . on @xmath0 the i@xmath2 peak develops and at the same time both peaks shift gradually to higher binding energy . at the highest coverage",
    "the i@xmath21 spectra are rather similar .",
    "the appearance of i@xmath2 on the @xmath0 surface may at first seem surprising , since very small , if any , changes were observed in c@xmath13 , n@xmath13 , zn@xmath22 and pt@xmath18 spectra .",
    "one further observation is important : the relative intensity of i@xmath2 increases with the znpc coverage , thus it is not an interface effect .",
    "instead , we suggest that iodine is taken from the pt surface and dissolved in the znpc thin film .",
    "iodine has been used as dopant in organic films for many years  @xcite .",
    "depending on the concentration the conductivity in for example pbpc was increased by as much as nine orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the i@xmath2 from the @xmath0 surface component is shifted to lower binding energy , which in a simple picture signifies a higher local electron density and/or good conductivity for screening of the final state core hole .",
    "the screening of the core hole can not be better than when the iodine is in direct contact with pt , so we propose that the shift is due to iodine being in a negatively charged state , i.e. it acts as an acceptor dopant in the znpc film .",
    "this is in agreement with previous results in nipc  @xcite and pentacene  @xcite .",
    "on @xmath1 there are coverage dependent shifts in c@xmath13 , n@xmath13 and zn@xmath22 , which suggest that the iodine doping is lesser in this case .",
    "the shifts are smaller than on pt(111 ) , thus there is most probably doping .",
    "the dopant related i@xmath2 component unfortunately overlaps with the original i@xmath2 component , thus iodine doping can not unambiguously be confirmed by our i@xmath21 spectra .",
    "doping and differences in conductivity will also affect the structure and relative molecular orientation in the organic film , since the charge distribution within molecules and the screening of electrostatic forces will be different .",
    "the electronic structure of znpc layers , from sub - monolayers to thick films , on pt(111 ) is studied by means of x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) , x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "our core - level - spectroscopy results suggest a non - planar , buckled molecular configuration for znpc adsorbed on pt(111 ) , induced by the zn - pt interaction .",
    "it is shown that znpc molecules do not form a complete monolayer on the pt surface , due to a surface - mediated intermolecular repulsion .",
