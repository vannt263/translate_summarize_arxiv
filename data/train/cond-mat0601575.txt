    "the close interplay between charge dynamics and magnetism is the basic feature of the manganites a@xmath0b@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( a = la , nd and b = sr , ca ) . generally speaking ,",
    "these perovskites show poor conductivity in the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase at high @xmath8 , metallic conduction in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase , charge localization and ( often ) ordering in the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase at low @xmath8 .",
    "the metallic fm phase is explained by the double - exchange mechanism @xcite , with corrections @xcite for the jahn - teller distortion that the oxygen octahedra around the mn@xmath7 ions experience as they receive an additional electron .",
    "the polaronic nature of the carriers is confirmed by the observation of characteristic bands in the mid - infrared @xcite which depend both on doping and temperature .",
    "the insulating character of the af phases is basically explained by the hund s mechanism .",
    "each mn@xmath7 ion has three electrons @xmath9 , and spin @xmath10 = 3/2 .",
    "an mn@xmath6 ion at site @xmath11 has an additional electron @xmath12 with spin @xmath13 = 1/2 and hund s energy @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be up and the system slightly electron - doped , so that the 6 nearest neighbors at sites @xmath16 are all mn@xmath7 with @xmath17 . in the high - temperature pm phase",
    "the @xmath18 are randomly oriented .",
    "one at least will be up , and will allow for a @xmath19 hopping with no change in the hund s energy ( fig .",
    "[ scheme]-a ) .",
    "as the @xmath16 site is initially undistorted , the electron will then pay an energy    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the @xmath22 jahn - teller splitting .",
    "its value may include corrections for the `` breathing '' distortion of the oxygen octahedra around mn@xmath7 @xcite , or for the binding energy of a magnetic polaron which forms around the hopping electron @xcite .    in an af phase of type @xmath4 all the @xmath18 are antiparallel to @xmath23 .",
    "if the system enters such phase below the nel temperature @xmath24 , the hund s final energy becomes @xmath25 and the hopping electron will pay an extra - energy @xmath26 . according to calculations for camno@xmath27 , based on the local density approximation@xcite ,",
    "the lowest antiparallel state is @xmath9 . in this case",
    "the energy diagram is that of fig .",

    "as @xmath32 is much larger than the thermal energy available below @xmath24 , the @xmath30 electron will remain localized at @xmath11 . in an af phase of type @xmath5 on the other hand , both @xmath18 above and below @xmath15 are up while the four in - plane ones are down @xcite .",
    "the electron will pay just @xmath33 to move along the @xmath34 axis , a much higher @xmath32 to move in the plane .",

    "we show that , in a manganite at low electron dilution , this induces a spectacular effect in its mid - infrared absorption .",
    "this effect allows one to determine , with unprecedented precision , most of the energies involved in the above equations .",
    "the experiment is performed on sr@xmath0ce@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( scmo ) , where ce is in the + 3 state @xcite and provides the electrons , because : i ) unlike the la - based manganites @xcite , it exhibits a good chemical stability at low doping ; ii ) it exhibits different af phases and nel temperatures for different @xmath3 , and this will provide a good check of the results .",

    "we have measured , for both @xmath3 = 0.05 and 0.10 , the reflectivity @xmath47 of polycrystalline pellets of sr@xmath0ce@xmath1mno@xmath2 , prepared and controlled as described in ref . .",
    "@xmath47 was measured at nearly normal incidence ( 8@xmath48 ) on an accurately polished surface .",
    "the absence of `` ghost '' peaks in @xmath49 around 0.1 ev , as those reported for certain single crystals after polishing @xcite , excludes appreciable surface damage to our polycrystalline pellets , where the radiation penetrates deeply due to their poor optical conductivity ( @xmath50 10@xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 at all frequencies and temperatures , see below ) . in order to minimize errors due to residual irregularities of the surface ,",
    "the reference was obtained by evaporating a metal film onto the sample ( gold for @xmath54 14000 @xmath53 , silver between 14000 @xmath53 and 20000 @xmath53 ) .",
    "the results were then corrected for their real reflectivity .",
    "data were collected by a rapid - scanning interferometer between 30 and 20000 @xmath53 and by thermoregulating the samples within @xmath55 2 k between 380 and 15 k. from 20000 to 40000 @xmath53 , @xmath49 was measured at room temperature with respect to a silver mirror by using a monochromator coupled to a charge - coupled device .",
    "the polycrystalline nature of the material may be source of errors , especially in the far infrared , if the transport properties are strongly anisotropic @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case , the in - plane mn - o(2 ) bond length differs from the orthogonal mn - o(1 ) one by less than 1.5 % @xcite .",
    "moreover , anisotropies in @xmath56 , as those reported for scmo in ref . above @xmath3 = 0.30 , are rigorously excluded for our sample with @xmath3 = 0.05 , where also the @xmath37 phase is isotropic ( @xmath4 ) . as the same bands are observed at @xmath3 = 0.10",
    ", one can conclude that the latter spectra are also fully reliable .",
    "both the reflectivity @xmath49 and the resulting optical conductivity @xmath56 are shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma_005 ] for the 0.05 sample .",
    "three main phonon lines , as predicted for the pm3 m structure of these perovskites @xcite , are observed at low @xmath57 .",
    "they are partially shielded at high @xmath8 by a weak drude contribution accounting for the poor dc conductivity of the pm phase . on the opposite side ,",
    "the strong band at 18000 @xmath53 is due to o - mn charge transfer @xcite .",
    "the usual sum rule on @xmath56 is fulfilled , provided that it is integrated up to 15000 @xmath53 . however , in the mid - infrared range a broad band dramatically shifts towards higher energies when cooling the sample . in order to better study this effect ,",
    "the imaginary part of the dielectric function @xmath58 was fitted to a drude - lorentz model as in ref . .",
    "then , both the far - infrared contributions from phonons and drude , and the tail of the strong band at high energy in fig .",

    "[ bands_005 ] , sr@xmath59ce@xmath60mno@xmath27 shows in the pm phase a single band @xmath35 peaked at 2500 @xmath53 , or about 0.3 ev . at 220 k , as @xmath24 is approached by cooling the sample , the peak energy does not change but its intensity decreases rapidly until , at 180 k , the @xmath35 band is fully replaced by a @xmath61 band peaked at @xmath62 7500 @xmath53 , or approximately 0.9 ev .",
    "the spectral weights @xmath63 and @xmath64 , obtained by integrating the @xmath56 of the corresponding bands , are plotted vs. temperature in fig .",
    "[ int_005 ] .",
    "therein , one can appreciate the on - off transfer of spectral weight from @xmath35 to @xmath61 , and check that it is triggered by the pm - af transition at @xmath24 .",
    "basing on the scenario described above , one can reasonably associate the @xmath35 band of the pm phase with inter - site transitions with @xmath15 and @xmath18 parallel .",
    "@xmath33 in eq .",
    "[ jt ] is therefore 0.3 ev .",
    "the @xmath61 band observed below @xmath24 is instead due to the same transitions with @xmath15 and @xmath18 antiparallel , so that @xmath32 in eq .",
    "[ t2 g ] is 0.9 ev .",
    "the fact that antiparallel hopping is not observed at all in the pm phase implies that therein the @xmath30 electron tends to align the core spins of the neighboring mn@xmath7 ions , forming magnetic polarons .",
    "this is indeed predicted to occur @xcite in the electron - doping region of la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath27 with @xmath65 , which corresponds to the present case .",
    "their binding energy @xcite of @xmath62 0.1 ev should be subtracted to the peak energy of @xmath35 , thus providing in eq .",
    "[ jt ] @xmath66 0.2 ev for a mn@xmath6 ion in a matrix of mn@xmath7 .    the optical response of the @xmath3 = 0.10 sample",

    "[ sigma_010]-a and -b in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath56 , respectively , up to 380 k , well in the pm phase .",
    "besides the phonon lines , a pronounced peak appears in @xmath56 at 12000 @xmath53 or 1.5 ev .",
    "its shape is also shown as provided by a lorentzian fit .",
    "this contribution , which at @xmath3 = 0.05 is not resolved from the o - mn charge - transfer but is required by the fit , is also clearly seen in srmno@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "bands at 1.5 ev were observed in several hole - doped manganites , and assigned to @xmath22 transitions of different kind according to different authors .",
    "they were proposed to occur within the mn@xmath6 ions @xcite , or in inter - site jumps with either @xmath23 and @xmath18 antiparallel @xcite or parallel @xcite )",
    ". however , the band at 1.5 ev here appears at low or even zero doping @xcite , where there are no mn@xmath6 ions .",
    "moreover , 1.5 ev appears to be much higher than the expected jahn - teller splitting @xmath22 , which should be on the scale of the lattice excitations .",
    "therefore , also in agreement with ref . , it seems reasonable to assign the 1.5 ev band to the @xmath67 crystal field splitting @xmath29 in eq .",
    "[ t2 g ] .",
    "the subtraction procedure described above , when applied to the mid - infrared absorption of @xmath3 = 0.10 ( fig .",
    "[ bands_010 ] ) shows again two bands @xmath35 and @xmath61 , with @xmath35 which transfers most of its spectral weight to @xmath61 below @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , as in the 0.05 sample , magnetic polarons should be present in the pm phase at @xmath3 0.10 .",
    "they are expected to have a lower binding energy than at 0.05 .",
    "indeed , magnetic and dc resistivity measurements on ca@xmath0la@xmath1mno@xmath2 for @xmath65 show that the polaron energy may decrease by an order of magnitude as @xmath3 increases @xcite .",
    "this is fully consistent with fig .",
    "[ bands_010 ] , where @xmath35 is peaked at 1700 - 2000 @xmath53 ( depending on @xmath8 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the bare @xmath68 = 0.2 ev measured for @xmath3 = 0.05 , with a negligible correction for the energy of the magnetic polaron .",
    "@xmath61 is peaked instead at 6500 @xmath53 or 0.8 ev . in @xmath69 ,",
    "both bands are well represented at any @xmath8 by lorentzians",
    "which , in terms of @xmath56 , are shown at 320 k in the same figure .",
    "the spectral weights @xmath63 and @xmath64 change with temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ int_010 ] . a comparison with the @xmath41 of fig .",
    "[ chi]-b shows a transfer of spectral weight between the two bands around @xmath70 295 k , even if much less pronounced than for @xmath3 = 0.05 .",
    "indeed at @xmath3 = 0.10 both bands are present also below @xmath24 , with @xmath71 1/3 .",
    "this is consistent with the 0.10 system being in a phase of type @xmath5 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "basing only on the spin population ratio in a @xmath5-type phase one would obtain @xmath72 = 1/2 .",
    "however , the dipole matrix elements can not be the same for @xmath19 hopping with @xmath23 and @xmath18 parallel and antiparallel , as the final states are different . also partial charge ordering ,",
    "as that observed in nd@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 for @xmath73 0.3 @xcite , might affect @xmath72 through an anisotropic distribution of the 10% mn@xmath6 ions .",
    "for example , if the latter ions were distributed preferentially along the @xmath34 axis , where the ion spins are parallel , part of the transitions which produce band @xmath35 would become mn@xmath6 - mn@xmath6 .",
    "they would then move to much higher energies , due to the hubbard repulsion , making @xmath74 .",
    "one can now determine the energies involved in the electron hopping .",
    "both @xmath75 0.4 ev , on the scale of lattice excitations as expected , and @xmath76 ev , are measured directly .",
    "the hund s splitting can then be found using eq .",
    "one finds @xmath26 = 0.9 - 0.2 + 1.5 = 2.2 ev for @xmath3 = 0.05 , @xmath26 = 0.8 - 0.2 + 1.5 = 2.1 ev for @xmath3 = 0.10 . within the 10 % uncertainty of the experiment",
    "both samples provide the same value , which also falls in the range calculated in ref . for a @xmath77 hund",

    "if instead the lowest final state with antiparallel spin were @xmath30 , one would obtain @xmath26 = 0.7 ( 0.6 ) ev for @xmath3 = 0.05 ( 0.10 ) .",
    "these values , however , would be much lower than usually expected for the hund s splitting .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have directly observed the dramatic change of the mid - infrared optical conductivity induced by the onset of the hund s mechanism at the pm - afm transition .",
    "the effect , so clearly observed for the use of an electron system at high dilution , allowed us to determine @xmath21 , @xmath29 , and @xmath26 with good accuracy .",
