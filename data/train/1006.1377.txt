    "one of the critical issues in wireless multi - user networks is efficient allocation of available radio resources in order to improve the network performance @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore , power allocation strategies in wireless multi - user networks have been extensively studied @xcite@xcite . in practical wireless networks , however , both the available transmission power of individual nodes and the total available bandwidth of the network are limited and , therefore , joint bandwidth and power allocation must be considered @xcite@xcite .",
    "such joint bandwidth and power allocation is important for both systems with and without relaying . in the case of severe channel conditions in direct links",
    ", relays can be deployed to forward the data from a source to a destination in order to improve communication efficiency @xcite@xcite .",
    "there are numerous works conducted on the resource allocation in wireless relay networks ( see , for example , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "power allocation with the decode - and - forward ( df ) protocol has been studied in @xcite under the assumption that transmitters only know mean channel gains . in @xcite ,",
    "a power allocation scheme that aims at maximizing the smallest of two transceiver signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) has been studied for two - way relay networks . to optimize effective capacity in relay networks , time / bandwidth allocation strategies with constant power",
    "have been developed based on time division multiple access / frequency division multiple access ( tdma / fdma ) in @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite@xcite as well as most of the works on the resource allocation in wireless relay networks consider the case of a single user , i.e. , a single source - destination pair .",
    "resource allocation for wireless multi - user relay networks has been investigated only in few works @xcite@xcite .",
    "power allocation aiming at optimizing the sum capacity of multiple users for four different relay transmission strategies has been studied in @xcite , while an af based strategy in which multiple sources share multiple relays using power control has been developed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the works mentioned above ( except @xcite ) have assumed equal and fixed bandwidth allocation for the one - hop links from a source to a destination .",
    "in fact , it is inefficient to allocate the bandwidth equally when the total available bandwidth is limited .",
    "moreover , the problem of joint allocation of bandwidth and power has never been considered for wireless multi - user relay networks .",
    "various performance metrics for resource allocation in multi - user networks have been considered .",
    "system throughput maximization and the worst user throughput maximization are studied using convex optimization in @xcite .",
    "sum capacity maximization is taken as an objective for power allocation in @xcite , while max - min snr , power minimization , and throughput maximization are used as power allocation criteria in @xcite .    in some applications",
    ", certain minimum transmission rates must be guaranteed for the users in order to satisfy their quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements .",
    "for instance , in real - time voice and video applications , a minimum rate should be guaranteed for each user to satisfy the delay constraints of the services . however , when the rate requirements can not be supported for all users , admission control is adopted to decide which users to be admitted into the network .",
    "the admission control in wireless networks typically aims at maximizing the number of admitted users and has been recently considered in several works .",
    "a single - stage reformulation approach for a two - stage joint resource allocation and admission control problem is proposed in @xcite , @xcite , while another approach is based on user removals @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the problem of joint bandwidth and power allocation for wireless multi - user networks with and without relaying is considered , which is especially efficient for the networks with both limited bandwidth and limited power .",
    "the joint bandwidth and power allocation are proposed to ( i )  maximize the sum capacity of all users ; ( ii )  maximize the capacity of the worst user ; ( iii )  minimize the total power consumption of all users .",
    "the corresponding joint bandwidth and power allocation problems can be formulated as optimization problems that are shown to be convex .",
    "therefore , these problems can be solved efficiently by using convex optimization techniques . the joint bandwidth and power allocation together with admission control",
    "is further considered , and a greedy search algorithm is developed in order to reduce the computational complexity of solving the admission control problem .",
    "the optimality conditions of the greedy search are derived and analyzed .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "system models of multi - user networks without relaying and with df relaying are given in section  [ sec_md ] . in section  [ sec_al ] , joint bandwidth and power allocation problems for the three aforementioned objectives",
    "are formulated and studied for both types of systems with and without relaying .",
    "the admission control based joint bandwidth and power allocation problem is formulated in section  [ sec_ad ] , where the greedy search algorithm is also developed and investigated for both types of systems with and without relaying .",
    "numerical results are reported in section  [ sec_sim ] , followed by concluding remarks in section  [ sec_con ] .",
    "consider a wireless network , which consists of @xmath0 source nodes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 destination nodes @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the network serves @xmath6 users @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where each user represents a one - hop link from a source to a destination .",
    "the set of users which are served by @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "a spectrum of total bandwidth @xmath10 is available for the transmission from the sources .",
    "this spectrum can be divided into distinct and nonoverlapping channels of unequal bandwidths , so that the sources share the available spectrum through frequency division and , therefore , do not interfere with each other .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the allocated transmit power and channel bandwidth of the source to serve @xmath7 .",
    "then the received snr at the destination of @xmath7 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the channel gain of the source  destination link of @xmath7 and @xmath15 stands for the power of additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) over the bandwidth @xmath12 .",
    "the channel gain @xmath14 results from such effects as path loss , shadowing , and fading . due to the fact that the power spectral density ( psd ) of awgn is constant over all frequencies with the constant value denoted by @xmath16 , the noise power in the channel is linearly increasing with the channel bandwidth .",
    "it can be seen from that a channel with larger bandwidth introduces higher noise power and , thus , reduces the snr .",
    "channel capacity gives the upper bound on the achievable rate of a link .",
    "given @xmath17 , the source  destination link capacity of @xmath7 is @xmath18 it can be seen that @xmath12 characterizes channel bandwidth , and @xmath19 characterizes spectral efficiency and , thus , @xmath20 characterizes data rate over the source  destination link in bits per second .",
    "moreover , for fixed @xmath12 , @xmath20 is a concave increasing function of @xmath11 .",
    "it can be also shown that @xmath21 is a concave increasing function of @xmath12 for fixed @xmath11 , although @xmath17 is a linear decreasing function of @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , it can be proved that @xmath21 is a concave function of @xmath11 and @xmath12 jointly @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath22 relay nodes @xmath23 , @xmath24 added to the network described in the previous subsection and used to forward the data from the sources to the destinations .",
    "then each user represents a two - hop link from a source to a destination via relaying . to reduce the implementation complexity at the destinations ,",
    "single relay assignment is adopted so that each user has one designated relay",
    ". then the set of users served by @xmath23 is denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the relays work in a half - duplex manner due to the practical limitation that they can not transmit and receive at the same time . a two - phase decode - and - forward ( df )",
    "protocol is assumed , i.e. , the relays receive and decode the transmitted data from the sources in the first phase , and re - encode and forward the data to the destinations in the second phase .",
    "the sources and relays share the total available spectrum in the first and second phases , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that the direct links between the sources and the destinations are blocked and , thus , are not available .",
    "note that although the two - hop relay model is considered in the paper , the results are applicable for multi - hop relay models as well .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the allocated transmit power and channel bandwidth of the relay to serve @xmath7 .",
    "the two - hop source  destination link capacity of @xmath7 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the one - hop source  relay and relay  destination link capacities of @xmath7 , respectively , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the corresponding channel gains .",
    "it can be seen from that if equal bandwidth is allocated to @xmath12 and @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be unequal due to the power limits on @xmath33 and @xmath26 .",
    "then the source  destination link capacity @xmath20 is constrained by the minimum of @xmath34 and @xmath30 .",
    "note that since all users share the total bandwidth of the spectrum , equal bandwidth allocation for all one - hop links can be inefficient .",
    "therefore , the joint allocation of bandwidth and power is necessary .",
    "different objectives can be considered while jointly allocating bandwidth and power in wireless multi - user networks .",
    "the widely used objectives for network optimization are ( i )  the sum capacity maximization ; ( ii )  the worst user capacity maximization ; and ( iii )  the total network power minimization . in this section ,",
    "the problems of joint bandwidth and power allocation are formulated for the aforementioned objectives for both considered systems with and without relaying .",
    "it is shown that all these problems are convex and , therefore , can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization methods .      in the applications without delay constraints ,",
    "a high data rate from any user in the network is preferable .",
    "thus , it is desirable to allocate the resources to maximize the overall network performance , e.g. , the sum capacity of all users .      in this case , the joint bandwidth and power allocation problem aiming at maximizing the sum capacity of all users can be mathematically formulated as    @xmath35    the nonnegativity constraints on the optimization variables @xmath36 are natural and , thus , omitted throughout the paper for brevity . in the problem  , the constraint stands that the total power at @xmath37 is limited by @xmath38 , while the constraint indicates that the total bandwidth of the channels allocated to the sources is also limited by @xmath10 .",
    "note that since @xmath20 is a jointly concave function of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the objective function is convex .",
    "the constraints and are linear and , thus , convex . therefore , the problem  itself is convex . using the convexity ,",
    "the closed - form solution of the problem  is given in the following proposition .",
    "* proposition 1 : * _ the optimal solution of the problem  , denoted by @xmath39 , is @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 . _",
    "* proof : *  see appendix a.    proposition  1 shows that for a set of users served by one source , the sum capacity maximization based allocation strategy allocates all the power of the source only to the user with the highest channel gain and , therefore , results in highly unbalanced resource allocation among the users .",
    "the sum capacity maximization based joint bandwidth and power allocation problem for the network with df relaying is given by    @xmath48    introducing new variables @xmath49 , the problem  can be equivalently rewritten as    @xmath50    note that the constraints and are convex since @xmath29 and @xmath30 are jointly concave functions of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the constraints are linear and , thus , convex .",
    "therefore , the problem  itself is convex .",
    "it can be seen that the closed - form solution of the problem  is intractable due to the coupling of the constraints and .",
    "however , the convexity of the problem  allows to use standard numerical convex optimization algorithms for solving the problem efficiently @xcite .    intuitively , the sum capacity maximization based allocation for the network with df relaying can not result in significantly unbalanced resource allocation as that for the network without relaying .",
    "it is because the channel gains in both transmission phases for the networks with relaying affect the achievable capacity of each user .",
    "the following proposition gives the conditions under which the sum capacity maximization based resource allocation strategy for the network with relaying does not allocate any resources to some users .",
    "* proposition  2 : * _ if @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , then @xmath55 .",
    "_    * proof : *  see appendix a.    in particular , if two users are served by the same source and the same relay , and one user has lower channel gains than the other user in both transmission phases , then no resource is allocated to the former user .",
    "fairness among users is also an important issue for resource allocation .",
    "if the fairness issue is considered , the achievable rate of the worst user is commonly used as the network performance measure . in this case , the joint bandwidth and power allocation problem for the network without relaying can be mathematically formulated as    @xmath56    similar , for the networks with relaying , the joint bandwidth and power allocation problem can be formulated as    @xmath57    introducing a variable @xmath58 , the problem  can be equivalently written as    @xmath59    similar to the sum capacity maximization based allocation problems , it can be shown that the problems  and  are convex .",
    "therefore , the optimal solutions can be efficiently obtained using standard convex optimization methods .",
    "the next proposition indicates that the worst user capacity maximization based allocation leads to absolute fairness among users , just the opposite to the sum capacity maximization based allocation .",
    "the proof is intuitive from the fact that the total bandwidth is shared by all users , and is omitted for brevity .",
    "* proposition  3 : * _ in the problems  and  , the capacities of all users are equal at optimality . _",
    "another widely considered design objective is the minimization of the total power consumption of all users .",
    "this minimization is performed under the constraint that the rate requirements of all users are satisfied . the corresponding joint bandwidth and power allocation problem for the network without relaying",
    "can be written as    @xmath60    while the same problem for the network with relaying is    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the minimum acceptable capacity for @xmath7 and the constraints and indicate that the one - hop link capacities of @xmath7 should be no less than the given capacity threshold . similar to the sum capacity maximization and worst user capacity maximization based allocation problems , the problems  and  are convex and , thus , can be solved efficiently as mentioned before .",
    "in the multi - user networks under consideration , admission control is required if a certain minimum capacity must be guaranteed for each user .",
    "the admission control aims at maximizing the number of admitted users and is considered next for both systems with and without relaying .",
    "the admission control based joint bandwidth and power allocation problem in the network without relaying can be mathematically expressed as    @xmath63    where @xmath64 stands for the cardinality of @xmath65 .",
    "note that the problem  can be solved using exhaustive search among all possible subsets of users .",
    "however , the computational complexity of the exhaustive search can be very high since the number of possible subsets of users is exponentially increasing with the number of users , which is not acceptable for practical implementation .",
    "therefore , we develop a suboptimal greedy search algorithm that significantly reduces the complexity of finding the maximum number of admissible users .",
    "consider the following problem    @xmath66    the following proposition provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the admissibility of a set of users .",
    "* proposition  4 : * _ a set of users @xmath65 is admissible if and only if @xmath67 .",
    "_    * proof : *  see appendix b.    according to proposition  4 , the optimal value @xmath68 is the minimum total bandwidth required to support the users in @xmath65 , given that all power constraints are satisfied .",
    "this is instrumental in establishing our greedy search algorithm , which removes users one by one until the remaining users are admissible .",
    "the ` worst ' user , i.e. , the user whose removal reduces the total bandwidth requirement to the maximum extent , is removed at each greedy search iteration . in other words , the removal of the ` worst ' user results in the minimum total bandwidth requirement of the remaining users .",
    "thus , the removal criterion can be stated as @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the user removed at the @xmath71-th greedy search iteration , @xmath72 denotes the set of remaining users after @xmath71 greedy search iterations , and the symbol ` @xmath73 ' stands for the set difference operator .",
    "note that , intuitively , @xmath74 should be the ` best ' set of @xmath75 users that requires the minimum total bandwidth among all possible sets of @xmath75 users from @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the corresponding minimum total bandwidth requirement .",
    "thus , the stopping rule for the greedy search iterations should be finding such @xmath78 that @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in other words , @xmath81 is expected to be the maximum number of admissible users , i.e. , the optimal value of the problem  , denoted by @xmath82 .",
    "it can be seen from proposition  4 that using the exhaustive search for finding the maximum number of admissible users is equivalent to checking @xmath68 for all possible @xmath83 and , therefore , the number of times of solving the problem  is upper bounded by @xmath84 . on the other hand",
    ", it can be seen from that using the greedy search , the number of times of solving the problem  is upper bounded by @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the complexity of the proposed greedy search is significantly reduced as compared to that of the exhaustive search , especially if @xmath6 is large and @xmath82 is small . moreover",
    ", the complexity of the greedy search can be further reduced .",
    "the lemma given below follows directly from the decomposable structure of the problem  , that is , @xmath86 .",
    "* lemma  1 : * _ the reduction of the total bandwidth requirement after removing a certain user is only coupled with the users served by the same source as this user , and is decoupled with the users served by other sources .",
    "mathematically , it means that _ @xmath87 _ for _ @xmath88 , @xmath89 .    for the sake of brevity , the proof of the lemma",
    "is omitted as trivial .",
    "let @xmath90 denote the set of remaining users served by @xmath1 after @xmath71 greedy search iterations .",
    "applying lemma  1 directly to the removal criterion in , the following proposition can be obtained .",
    "* proposition  5 : * _ the user to be removed at the @xmath71-th greedy search iteration according to can be found by first finding the ` worst ' user in each set of users served by each source , i.e. , @xmath91 and then determining the ` worst ' user among all these worst users .",
    "mathematically , it means that _ @xmath92 _ where _ @xmath93 .",
    "the proof is omitted for brevity .",
    "proposition  5 can be directly used to build an algorithm for searching for the user to be removed at each greedy search iteration .",
    "it is important that such algorithm has a reduced computational complexity compared to the direct use of . as a result , although the number of times that the problem  has to be solved remains the same , the number of variables of the problem  solved at each time is reduced , and is upper bounded by @xmath94 .",
    "we also study the conditions under which the proposed greedy search algorithm is optimal .",
    "specifically , the greedy search is optimal if the set of remaining users after each greedy search iteration is the ` best ' set of users , i.e. , @xmath95 where latexmath:[$\\mathcal{n}^{\\ast}_{i } \\triangleq \\textrm{arg } \\min _ {    users .",

    "the following theorem provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the proposed greedy search .",

    "_ c1 : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 ; _",

    "* proof : *  see appendix b.    theorem  1 decouples the optimality condition into two equivalent conditions per each set of users @xmath9 . specifically , the condition c1 indicates that the set of remaining users in @xmath9 after each greedy search iteration is the ` best ' set of users , while the condition c2 indicates that the reduction of the total bandwidth requirement is decreasing with the greedy search iterations .",
    "theorem  1 allows to focus on equivalent problems in which users are subject to the same power constraint .",
    "the following proposition stands that the condition c2 of theorem  1 always holds , which reduces the study on the optimality of the proposed greedy search only to checking the condition c1 of theorem  1 .",

    "then the problem  for the set of users @xmath9 can be rewritten as    @xmath114    the following lemma gives a condition under which c1 holds for a specific @xmath71 .",

    "it is worth noting that c1 does not hold in general . indeed , since the reduction of the total bandwidth requirement is maximized only at each single greedy search iteration , the greedy search does not guarantee that the reduction of the total bandwidth requirement is also maximized over multiple greedy search iterations . in other words , it does not guarantee that the set of remaining users is the ` best ' set of users . in order to demonstrate this , we present the following counter example .",
