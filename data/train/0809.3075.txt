    "it is well known that in the limit of zero quark masses the classical action of qcd is invariant under the exchange of quark fields with different chirality .",
    "this classical chiral symmetry , however , appears to be broken in quantum theory .",
    "its spontaneous breakdown gives rise to massless goldstone particles ( pions ) , and to nonzero expectation value of the chiral condensate @xmath5 . since pions are the only massless hadrons in this limit , one can describe infrared qcd using an effective chiral theory where pions are the only degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "at sufficiently high temperatures chiral symmetry is restored again , and the effective chiral theory is not valid any more , which means that at such temperatures the effective degrees of freedom are not pions .",
    "it is commonly believed that the restoration of chiral symmetry is associated with the confinement - deconfinement transition , with the chiral condensate being the order parameter . for quenched gauge theories",
    "the chiral condensate is not an exact order parameter , since in this case it does not correspond to expectation value of any physical quantity and can be defined only indirectly , via the banks - casher relation @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density of eigenvalues @xmath8 of the dirac operator and @xmath9 is the volume of the four - dimensional box in which the theory is considered .",
    "thus the equation ( [ bankscasher ] ) relates the chiral condensate and the density of small eigenvalues of the dirac operator .    in quenched @xmath10 gauge theories",
    "a commonly used order parameter is the expectation value of the polyakov line , which is associated with @xmath11 center symmetry and which is equal to zero in the confinement phase , where center symmetry is unbroken @xcite .",
    "thus the polyakov loop and the chiral condensate are the proper order parameters for the deconfinement phase transition in the limits of infinite and zero quark masses , respectively . however ,",
    "numerical simulations indicate that both the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop can be used as approximate order parameters even when the corresponding symmetries are absent . in particular , for qcd with dynamical quarks",
    "polyakov line changes rapidly in the vicinity of the deconfinement phase transition @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the chiral condensate using the staggered dirac operator in quenched @xmath0 gauge theory has also shown that it goes to zero in the deconfinement phase @xcite . however , in some recent lattice studies of quenched @xmath0 lattice gauge theory with chirally invariant lattice dirac operator it was found that even above the deconfinement phase transition there are still some small eigenvalues @xmath8 which yield nonzero chiral condensate in the banks - casher relation ( [ bankscasher ] ) @xcite . to be more precise , it turns out that in the deconfinement phase with spontaneously broken center symmetry chiral condensate behaves differently depending on the sign of the polyakov loop . for field configurations with positive polyakov loop",
    "the chiral condensate eventually goes to zero at some temperature above @xmath4 , while for configurations with negative polyakov loops the chiral condensate stays nonzero at all temperatures which were considered @xcite . since for @xmath0 gauge theory with dynamical fermions at temperatures above the deconfinement phase transition positive values of polyakov loop are favoured , at @xmath12 it seems reasonable to consider only field configurations with positive polyakov loops in order to capture this important feature of the full qcd already in the quenched approximation @xcite .",
    "the value of the chiral condensate is usually extracted from the results of lattice simulations by measuring the probability distribution @xmath13 of the eigenvalues of the dirac operator @xmath14 and by using the banks - casher relation ( [ bankscasher ] ) .",
    "a much more precise method was proposed in @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the fact that the properly rescaled eigenvalue distribution @xmath13 at @xmath15 is universal and coincides with the eigenvalue distribution of the so - called chiral ensemble of random matrices @xcite : @xmath16 the form of the function @xmath17 depends only on the global symmetries of the dirac operator and on the topological charge of the gauge fields .",
    "one can also consider the probability distribution @xmath18 of the lowest nonzero eigenvalue of the dirac operator , which is also universal if @xmath19 is rescaled by the factor @xmath20 .",
    "numerically it was found that for the low - lying eigenvalues the universality holds with a good precision already at not very large lattice volumes , which can be easily achieved in lattice simulations @xcite . in this case for @xmath13 with @xmath21 of order of",
    "@xmath22 one has the following approximate equalities : @xmath23 thus in order to find the value of @xmath24 one can fit the lowest edge of the numerically obtained distributions @xmath13 or @xmath18 with the universal functions @xmath25 or @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are fitting parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is related to @xmath24 as @xmath29 .",
    "since such numerical procedure involves fitting lattice data with some function rather than finding a single value @xmath30 , the precision of this method is usually significantly higher than that of the banks - casher relation .",
    "finite - volume corrections are also believed to be smaller , which allows one to measure the chiral condensate using such small lattices as @xmath31 @xcite .",
    ".lattice parameters which were used for simulations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as an example , the histograms of the distributions @xmath13 and @xmath18 at temperatures @xmath32 ( @xmath33 lattice , @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 lattice , @xmath37 ) are plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : distribs ] together with the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 at the values of @xmath24 which best fit the lattice data .",
    "these values are summarized in table [ tab : ch_cond ] , where the results obtained using the banks - casher relation are also included for comparison .",
    "it can be seen that for all plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribs ] the lattice data agrees with the universal distributions within the range of statistical errors . for @xmath33 and @xmath36 lattices the fits for different topological sectors give different results for @xmath24 , and the banks - casher relation also yields somewhat higher value of the chiral condensate . for @xmath40 lattice",
    "the agreement between all measurements is much better .",
    "this indicates that for small lattices finite - volume effects are rather significant .",
    "these effects , however , influence only the value of @xmath24 but not the shape of the distribution of small eigenvalues , which remains universal .",
    "+    the distributions of eigenvalues for @xmath40 lattice at @xmath41 , which is just above @xmath4 , are plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : distribs_above ] .",
    "it can be seen that these distribution are indeed not similar to those predicted by random matrix theory , and can be characterized by a strong excess of eigenvalues below approximately @xmath42 .",
    "this characteristic peak in the density of the eigenvalues of the dirac operator has already been discussed in section [ sec : banks_casher ] .",
    "although it is most likely that this peak is a lattice artifact which disappears in the continuum limit , it seems useful to compare its shape with the one predicted by the model of dilute instanton - anti - instanton gas @xcite . in this model instantons and anti -",
    "instantons interact at the scale of several lattice spacings rather than at a physical scale @xcite , thus its success can serve as another argument that a strong excess of small eigenvalues at @xmath12 is a lattice artifact .    in the model proposed in @xcite each near - zero mode is associated either with an instanton or anti - instanton and the matrix elements of the dirac operator between the modes @xmath43 and @xmath44 are approximated by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is some energy scale , @xmath47 is the minimal distance in lattice units between the instanton associated with the mode @xmath43 and the anti - instanton associated with the mode @xmath44 and @xmath48 is a typical scale of interactions between instantons and anti - instantons induced by fermionic fields .",
    "matrix elements between the modes associated with two instantons or two anti - instantons are assumed to be zero . with @xmath46 being equal to the inverse lattice spacing ,",
    "the optimal value of @xmath48 for our data is @xmath49 .",
    "eigenvalue distributions obtained from this model at the optimal value of @xmath48 are also plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : distribs_above ] .",
    "these distributions agree well with lattice data in the range @xmath50 , while for @xmath51 the density of eigenvalues of lattice dirac operator is significantly lower .",
    "thus at high temperatures the distributions of eigenvalues within the characteristic peak near @xmath52 are well described by the model used in @xcite , with the interaction scale between instantons being fixed in units of lattice spacing .",
    "this again suggests that the modes which constitute this peak should turn into exact zero modes in the continuum limit .",
    "this conclusion immediately rises the question about the model which could describe the spectrum of small eigenvalues of dirac operator at not very high temperatures above @xmath4 in the continuum limit .",
    "in this work we have measured the spectrum of low - lying eigenvalues of overlap dirac operator and the value of the chiral condensate in quenched @xmath0 lattice gauge theory with tadpole - improved symanzik action .",
    "our results suggest that depending on the temperature , the theory can be in the three regimes : a conventional confinement phase at @xmath53 , for which the polyakov line is zero and the chiral condensate is nonzero , a phase at @xmath54 , for which the polyakov line is nonzero and the chiral condensate is either very small or zero and which is therefore very similar to the conventional deconfinement phase , and a sort of `` transition regime '' at @xmath55 , where the polyakov line is nonzero and the chiral condensate is still comparable with a typical hadron scale . the chiral condensate changes rapidly at the transitions between all these regimes , which suggests that even in quenched theory center and chiral symmetries are closely related @xcite , although in a somewhat more specific way than in the theory with dynamical fermions .",
    "the distributions of low - lying eigenvalues of the dirac operator are universal in the confinement phase up to the critical temperature @xmath4 , and are described by the chiral orthogonal ensemble of random matrices , as it should be @xcite . on the other hand , in the `` transition regime ''",
    "the distributions of small eigenvalues become non - universal .",
    "this could be expected , since the proof of the universality of @xmath56 and @xmath57 at small @xmath21 is essentially based on the validity of the effective chiral theory @xcite , although it is often claimed in the literature that the spectrum of small eigenvalues should be universal whenever the eigenvalue density near zero is finite @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that at temperatures above @xmath4 , at which quarks are not confined in mesons anymore and the effective chiral theory becomes invalid , these distributions become non - universal . in this temperature range the data are better described by the phenomenological model of dilute instanton - anti - instanton gas considered in @xcite .",
    "it could be interesting to further investigate the applicability of such a model , since lattice simulations indicate that the density of topological charge is arranged into fractal - like structures which do not resemble instantons at all @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a typical feature of the dirac spectrum in the `` transition regime '' which is described by the model of @xcite , namely , the characteristic peak near @xmath52 , seems to be a lattice artifact which disappears in the continuum limit .",
    "it is therefore an open question what kind of continuum model may describe the properties of small dirac eigenvalues above @xmath4 and what are the objects responsible for the persistence of near - zero eigenmodes of the dirac operator .",
    "finally , at temperatures above approximately @xmath58 the density of small eigenvalues rapidly drops down once more to a value which is very close to zero .",
    "unfortunately , due to limited statistics it is very difficult to measure this density and to establish whether it is exactly equal to zero or not .",
    "it is an intriguing open question , since for quenched theory chiral symmetry is not a symmetry of the action at all and there are no theoretical reasons to expect that the chiral condensate turns to zero at some temperature .",
    "if it really does , this would mean that in pure gauge theory there are in fact two finite - temperature phase transitions , and it is not clear what might be the origin of the second transition .",
    "it is interesting to note here that some gauge theories constructed using the gauge / gravity duality , such as the sakai - sugimoto model , indeed exhibit two finite - temperature phase transitions , a deconfinement one and the one associated with spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
