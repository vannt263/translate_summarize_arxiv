    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has become one of the premier tools for understanding early universe astrophysics , classical cosmology and the formation of large - scale structure .",
    "it has a wealth of information about the origin and evolution of the universe encrypted in its signal .",

    "the small angular scale power spectrum of the temperature and polarization anisotropies contain information on the cosmological parameters and the structure that existed at decoupling ( see e.g.  bennett , turner & white  @xcite ) .",

    "1997 ; hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "experimentally , a flurry of results have been reported in the last five years .",
    "the study of the microwave sky has moved beyond the `` detection phase '' and into the `` imaging phase '' , with the next generation of experiments planning to provide detailed information about the shape of the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropies over a wide range of angular scales .",
    "the advent of low - noise , broadband , millimeter - wave amplifiers ( popieszalski  @xcite ) has made interferometry a particularly attractive technique for detecting and imaging low contrast emission , such as anisotropy in the cmb .",
    "an interferometer directly measures the fourier transform of the intensity distribution on the sky . by inverting the interferometer output ,",
    "images of the sky are obtained which include angular scales determined by the size and spacing of the individual array elements . in this paper",
    "we discuss a formalism for interpreting cmb anisotropies as measured by interferometers and examine what two upcoming experiments , the degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi ) and cosmic background interferometer ( cbi ) , may teach us about cosmology .    several previous papers have dealt with the analysis of cmb data from interferometers ( martin & partridge  @xcite ; subrahmanyan et al .",

    "the use of interferometers to study fluctuations in the cmb goes back over a decade ( see table  [ tab : int ] ) .",
    "early work using the vla and atca concentrated on small angular scales , reporting a series of upper limits . recently the cat ( osullivan et al .",
    "@xcite ) has reported a detection of anisotropy on sub - degree scales , at low frequencies ( @xmath1ghz ) .",
    "several groups are now planning to build interferometers which operate at higher frequencies and over a larger range of angular scales , with sensitivities which should enable them to map in detail the cmb anisotropy spectrum from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    ".current experiments to measure cmb temperature anisotropies with interferometers .",
    "there are published upper limits from vla , ryle and atca .",
    "the cat has published a detection while vsa , dasi and cbi are expected to begin operations around 1999 - 2000 .",
    "the location , number of dishes / horns , frequency and ( approximate ) coverage in @xmath0 space are listed . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for all of these theories the uncertainties are larger due to the large correlations between parameters : if the bin size or noise is too large then one can not distinguish between variations in different parameters , inflating the marginalized errors . to decrease the correlations one must increase the resolution in @xmath4 , which means obtaining more sky coverage , or increase the total range of @xmath4 covered , which means combining dasi and cbi .",
    "the combination of dasi and cbi is particularly powerful , with the marginalized errors for each model being below 20% for all parameters within 1 year of observing .",
    "the resolution which we have in @xmath4-space is limited by the amount of sky that we have surveyed , which for a single pointing is equal to the size of the primary beam . by combining several contiguous pointings of the telescope we can increase the amount of surveyed sky and",
    "therefore increase the resolution in @xmath4-space .",
    "this is known as mosaicing .",
    "the idea here is to measure the visibility as a function of position @xmath5 from the map or phase center @xmath6 we then sample @xmath7 at a series of points by repointing the entire telescope .",
    "let us denote this by a sampling function @xmath8 which will be a sum of delta functions .",
    "we compute the fourier transform of @xmath9 which is simply the convolution @xmath10 where @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the original vector in the @xmath13 plane , and @xmath14 is the variable conjugate to @xmath5 .    if our sampling function is a sum of delta functions then @xmath15 is a sum of plane waves . thus simply summing our @xmath7 at points @xmath16 with weight @xmath17 changes our aperture in @xmath4-space from @xmath18 to @xmath19 which can be made much narrower",
    "this is completely analogous to the usual case of fraunhofer diffraction through many holes , treated in most textbooks on optics .",
    "the simplest example is when @xmath20 and the @xmath16 lie on a regular @xmath21 grid with spacing @xmath22 then @xmath23\\   { \\sin\\left[n 2\\pi v_x\\delta_x\\right]\\over\\sin\\left[2\\pi v_x\\delta_x\\right]}\\   { \\sin\\left[n 2\\pi v_y\\delta_y\\right]\\over\\sin\\left[2\\pi v_y\\delta_y\\right ] }   \\quad .\\ ] ] the second diffraction spike occurs at @xmath24 .",
    "if we choose @xmath25 sufficiently small ( nyquist sampling ) then this will be outside the range where @xmath18 vanishes . fig .",
    "[ fig : mosaic ] shows the gain for a @xmath26 mosaic .    in the absence of a preferred direction in the theory ,",
    "the power spectrum of the sky is symmetric in @xmath27 , so choosing a mosaicing strategy based on a cartesian grid is not optimal .",
    "we would like to have the mosaicing maximally rotationally symmetric within the observing constraints . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mosaic ] we compare the @xmath26 square to 7 points laid out at the center and vertices of a regular hexagon , with all points equidistant from their neighbors .",
    "note that mosaicing does not increase the _ range _ of @xmath4 to which we are sensitive ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : vuv ] ) , it simply enhances our _ resolution _ by allowing us to follow more periods of a given wave .",
    "thus we retain our ability to reject long - period noise or foregrounds .",
    "if the goal were simply a measurement of the power spectrum , it is just as efficient to use smaller telescopes ( with intrinsically better @xmath4 resolution ) and integrate for longer as it is to use large dishes and mosaic to increase the resolution .",
    "the advantage of the later method is that it allows better imaging of each piece of sky for checks of systematics , non - gaussian features and foregrounds and it is easier to avoid `` dropouts '' in the @xmath4 coverage for the power spectrum .",
    "there are two routes to analyzing mosaiced data .",
    "the first is to treat the visibilities @xmath28 as separate data , highly correlated in a calculable way , with apparently low resolution but much information in the correlations between visibilities .",
    "the theory correlation matrix of mosaiced data can be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : suwij ] ) with a modified window function which allows different pointing centers for each visibility @xmath29 } \\quad .\\ ] ] we discuss this further in  [ sec : osf ] below .",
    "the other route is to statistically weight the @xmath30 from the different @xmath16 to form a synthesized data set with fewer visibilities and correlations and intrinsically higher resolution .",
    "this method is perhaps simpler to understand but the weighting of the different @xmath16 will probably not be optimal for parameter estimation or power spectrum estimation .",
    "a set of data from several ( mosaiced ) pointings involves many measured visibilities , very few of which are independent .",
    "thus likelihood analysis requires repeated inversion of a large matrix , which can be computationally quite slow .",
    "one method for increasing the efficiency of the calculation is to work with a subset of the data which contains most of the signal , but has fewer elements .",
    "this transformation can be accomplished using an `` optimal subspace filter '' .",
    "consider first the case of a single ( unmosaiced ) pointing .",
    "for the _ dasi _ the visibilities will be measured at a specified set of @xmath12 at any one time , and then the instrument will be rotated about an axis through the center of the aperture plane to obtain a different set of @xmath12 with the same lengths but different orientations . in this way",
    "most of the @xmath13 plane will be covered allowing for imaging .",
    "the number of rotations will be chosen to almost fully sample the @xmath13 plane at the highest resolution ( largest baseline or largest @xmath4 ) .",
    "this means that considerable oversampling of the smaller baselines must result , since the aperture @xmath18 has a fixed width @xmath31 .",
    "phrased another way , the correlation matrix @xmath32 of our visibilities has dimension @xmath33 .",
    "however only a fraction of the entries are uncorrelated and contain `` new '' information about the theory .",
    "the rest are primarily a measure of the noise in the experiment . thus if we could perform a change of basis to those combinations which measure primarily signal and those which measure primarily noise we could work in a much smaller subspace of the data ( the `` signal '' subspace ) with little loss of information about the theory . in calculating the likelihood function",
    "we need to invert @xmath34 .",
    "since matrix inversion is an @xmath35 process , reducing the amount of data can dramatically decrease the processing time .    as a simple example of this technique ,",
    "imagine that we measure a visibility twice , with independent noise in each measurement .",
    "the signal in these two measurements is totally correlated .",
    "the sum of the two measurements is primarily sensitive to the signal ( with noise @xmath36 of each individual measurement ) while the difference measures primarily noise . thus if we `` change basis '' to the sum and difference of the two measurements we could work with the sum only with little loss of information",
    "this would halve the size of the matrix we would need to invert in the likelihood function and speed processing by a factor @xmath37 .",
    "optimal subspace filtering ( also known as the _ signal - to - noise eigenmode analysis _ or _ karhunen - loeve transform _ ) is a method designed to estimate the best change of basis and subspace in which to work .",
    "recent applications of this method to the cmb and large - scale structure can be found in ( bond  @xcite , bunn & sugiyama  @xcite , bunn , scott & white  @xcite , white & bunn  @xcite , bunn & white  @xcite , vogeley & szalay  @xcite , bond & jaffe  @xcite , tegmark , taylor & heavens  @xcite and tegmark , et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the above example",
    "@xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "this matrix has eigenvalues 2 and 0 and ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "the eigenvalues measure the signal - to - noise carried by the combination of data points @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are the ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors .",
    "in general it can be shown that to find the optimal subspace on which to project one finds the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the noise where @xmath46 is any square root of the noise correlation matrix , for example that defined by cholesky decomposition . ] in measurement @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath48 is positive definite and symmetric finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is straightforward ( e.g.  by jacobi transforms ) .",
    "arrange the eigenvectors in decreasing order of eigenvalue .",
    "the first @xmath49 eigenvectors in the sequence define the best @xmath49-dimensional subspace to use in filtering the noise from the data .",
    "once increasing the dimension of the subspace adds eigenvectors whose eigenvalues are @xmath50 the gain for the extra computing burden is marginal .",
    "the advantage of optimal subspace filtering when fitting mosaiced data is obvious .",
    "one wishes to cover the @xmath13 plane fully with the small effective apertures @xmath18 obtained after summing the individual pointings .",
    "thus each pointing oversamples the @xmath13 plane considerably in terms of its larger `` unmosaiced '' @xmath18 , and these visibilities are highly correlated .",
    "the optimal subspace filter identifies which combinations of the visibilities measure primarily the cosmological signal and which are mostly noise , allowing an optimal weighting to be given to the individual visibilities sets while retaining the processing time advantage of a smaller data set .",
    "in addition to power spectrum estimation and parameter constraints , one goal of dasi and cbi is to image the microwave sky .",
    "since interferometers do nt measure the temperature of the cmb sky directly , it is necessary to `` invert '' the measured visibilities to form a sky image . in general",
    "this inversion is not unique ( the dc level for example remains unconstrained ) and so must be regularized . on a field - by - field basis images of the sky",
    "can be made using the usual methods of synthesis imaging in radio astronomy ( e.g.  cornwell  @xcite ) and will form a useful data checking tool .    it is possible however to try to make a larger scale image of the microwave sky using other ( statistical ) techniques .",
    "on degree angular scales , such as probed by dasi , regularized images have been made from the acme / max ( white & bunn  @xcite ) , saskatoon ( tegmark et al .",
    "@xcite ) and cat ( jones  @xcite ) experiments by a variety of techniques .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward procedure for going from the visibility data to a sky image is wiener filtering .",
    "wiener filtering has been used extensively on cmb and large - scale structure data in the past ( e.g.  lahav et al .",
    "@xcite , bunn et al .",
    "@xcite , zaroubi et al .",
    "@xcite , bunn , hoffman & silk  @xcite ) and the reader is referred to those papers for a description of the underlying theory .",
    "the implementation of the wiener filter in the basis defined in  [ sec : osf ] is treated in many of the references given in that section .",
    "the wiener filter provides an estimate of the sky temperature at a point as a linear combination of the visibility data .",
    "if we assume that foregrounds and point sources have been removed from the visibility data and that the underlying sky is gaussian , then wiener filtering is the `` optimal '' imaging method . because it is linear , under the assumption of a gaussian sky , the error matrix in the map is also easy to calculate .    to proceed ,",
    "let us imagine pixelizing the sky into very many small pixels at position @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "this is purely a bookkeeping device which allows us to use a matrix notation for the wiener filter , the continuum limit is obtained trivially with a sum over pixels replaced by an integral .",
    "we denote the underlying temperature fluctuation on the sky by @xmath53 which is related to the @xmath54th visibility by @xmath55 where the weight matrix @xmath56 is ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : visdef ] ) @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the noise in the @xmath54th visibility .",
    "we have labelled @xmath59 with a subscript @xmath54 to allow for the possibility of mosaicing .    on an algorithmic note , it is computationally simpler to split the visibility into its real and imaginary parts and modify @xmath56 to have cosine and sine components so that one deals only with real variables .",
    "the number of data points is then doubled , and the noise covariance matrix must be modified by a factor of 2 also .",
    "we shall use a complex notation , with the understanding that the implementation of the algorithm may be in terms of real valued data .",
    "if we assume that the correlation matrices of the theory and noise are known ( or computed from the data , see seljak  @xcite ) then the wiener filtered estimate of the @xmath53 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the signal ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : cordef ] ) and noise ( eq .  [ eqn : cndef ] ) correlation matrices .",
    "the combination @xmath63 is essentially @xmath64 of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cvdef ] ) , we have written it in this way to allow the possibility of including other data sets as discussed below .",
    "notice that the form of the wiener filter is `` signal/(signal+noise ) '' as is usually the case .",
    "an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wfdef ] ) can be obtained for the ( formal ) error correlation matrix of the estimates ( see the above references ) .",
    "the most serious problem is that the wiener filtered image constructed in this manner is missing large scale power .",
    "this can be included by fitting to another data set , which retains the long wavelength modes , at the same time as the visibility data . in this case one",
    "extends the data vector @xmath65 to include the extra temperature data , with the associated @xmath56 . in the case of a mapping experiment ,",
    "@xmath56 is simply the beam .",
    "for most current degree scale experiments it is a beam modulated on the sky by a chopping pattern .",
    "we will defer a detailed analysis of how well we can reconstruct the sky under various observing strategies , and the noise properties of the images , to a future publication where we also plan to discuss the effect of sky curvature .",
    "neither the dasi or cbi will be polarization sensitive initially , however some instruments operating at smaller angular scales ( e.g.  the vla ) are already sensitive to linear polarization .",
    "the ( linear ) polarization of the cmb anisotropies is an important theoretical prediction , and can encode a great deal of information about the model ( for a recent review see hu & white  @xcite ) so we discuss it briefly here .",
    "our analysis is very similar to the small - angle formalism developed in seljak  ( @xcite ) , though we caution the reader that we have a different sign convention for the @xmath66- and @xmath67-modes , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we consider here only the small scale limit , so we treat the sky as a plane with a righthanded coordinate system upon it so that the sky is the @xmath68 plane .",
    "we define polarization in the horizontal ( @xmath69 ) and vertical ( @xmath70 ) directions to be @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "polarization in the @xmath73 and @xmath74 directions is defined to be @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively . in terms of light traveling to us along @xmath77 the intensity tensor @xmath78 , with @xmath79 , is @xmath80 where the angled brackets indicate an average over a time long compared with the frequency of the wave , @xmath81 is the electric field component and @xmath82 are the pauli matrices .",
    "we have neglected @xmath83 since this corresponds to circular polarization , which is not generated cosmologically . under a rotation by an angle @xmath84 around @xmath77 the temperature",
    "is clearly left invariant while @xmath85 transforms as a spin-2 tensor @xmath86 we expand @xmath85 in basis states known as spin - spherical harmonics @xmath87 with coefficients @xmath88 in analogy with the temperature fluctuations ( seljak & zaldarriaga  @xcite ; kamionkowski , kosowsky & stebbins  @xcite ; hu & white  @xcite ) . we can form states of definite parity , @xmath89 , which are called @xmath66- and @xmath67-mode polarization respectively ( not to be confused with the @xmath66 and @xmath67 modes of the radiation ) and which have angular power spectra @xmath90 and @xmath91 like the temperature .",
    "in addition the @xmath66-mode of the polarization is correlated with the temperature , so there is a fourth power spectrum : @xmath92 .",
    "the spin-2 spherical harmonics are better known in the context of quantum mechanics as wigner functions : @xmath93 where @xmath94 $ ] is the rotation operator and @xmath95 are the angular momentum operators . the case @xmath96 are the well known spherical harmonics .",
    "thus we can relate the @xmath87 to the usual @xmath97 through raising and lowering operators ( zaldarriaga & seljak  @xcite ) .",
    "the raising and lowering operators are differential operators since differentiating @xmath98 with respect to its arguments inserts @xmath99 inside the bracket in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sylmdef ] ) . in the flat space case",
    "the operators are trivially @xmath100 , with an overall normalization @xmath101 from the normalization of the angular momentum states .",
    "going to the flat space limit ( see appendix ) and acting on the fourier integral with @xmath102 we find that the fourier coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath104 are related to the measured @xmath105 and @xmath106 through @xmath107 where the signs reflect the definition of @xmath66 and @xmath67 in ( @xcite ) , and come from differentiating an imaginary exponential twice .",
    "[ we caution the reader that the power spectra output by the program _",
    "cmbfast _ differ in the sign of @xmath92 from this convention ( @xcite ) .",
    "obviously @xmath108 and @xmath109 are invariant under the sign change . ]",
    "if we recall that changing the sign of the polarization rotates the polarization `` vector '' through @xmath110 we see that the @xmath66-mode has polarization always tangential in the @xmath13 plane ( seljak  @xcite ; it would be radial under a sign change ) .",
    "we now have 4 non - vanishing power spectra , all diagonal in @xmath12 , whose diagonal parts we can denote by @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : suflat ] ) .",
    "this is all the formalism we need to allow us to reconstruct the power spectrum of temperature and polarization , or provide constraints on theoretical models .",
    "we proceed as in hu & white  ( @xcite ; see also zaldarriaga  @xcite ) by defining a vector of our data @xmath115 at each point @xmath116 .",
    "the likelihood function for this data is analogous to eq .",

    "alternatively one can provide upper limits ( or measurements ) of a bandpower for polarization or temperature by calculating @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the amplitude of a flat power spectrum ( i.e.  @xmath127constant ) for the @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 power spectra . [",
    "if information on the temperature is absent one merely drops the @xmath132 entries of the correlation matrix above . ]",
    "if one believes that there is no foreground contamination , the cosmological signal on small scales should be dominated by @xmath66-mode polarization and so one can set @xmath133 in evaluating the likelihood .",
    "the theoretical study of cmb anisotropies has advanced considerably in recent years , both in terms of theoretical predictions and comparison with observational data . in this paper",
    "we have developed some of the formalism necessary for the analysis of interferometer data , such as will be returned by vsa , dasi , cbi and vla , in the modern language of anisotropy ( temperature and polarization ) power spectra .",
    "although the fundamental entities measured by an interferometer differ considerably from those measured in single - dish experiments , much of the analysis can be presented in an analogous manner including power spectra , window functions and the like .",
    "this allows one to use directly the sophisticated analysis techniques which already exist for single - dish experiments .",
    "the formalism presented here is based upon the `` flat sky '' approximation and is thus best suited to the study of small - scale anisotropies . in this regime",
    "interferometers can provide high - sensitivity measurements of the high-@xmath0 peaks in the angular power spectrum , effects of gravitational lensing , the damping tail of the anisotropies and proto - galaxy formation and second order anisotropies .",
    "for cbi the cosmological signal would be higher if the universe had significant spatial curvature since this would shift the features in the angular power spectra to smaller angular scales , however for both vsa and dasi significant signal is expected simply based on existing measurements .",
    "several outstanding problems remain , all associated with extending the framework of this paper to larger angular scales where the curvature of the sky and the full 3d nature of the fourier transforms become important .",
    "we intend to return to these issues in a future paper .",
    "we would like to acknowledge useful conversations with wayne hu , douglas scott and max tegmark .",
    "we thank lyman page for many comments which helped to clarify the paper . m.w .",

    "the derivation of the correlation function eq .",
    "( [ eqn : suflat ] ) given in the text is sufficient for the purposes of this paper .",
    "however , sometimes it is convenient to treat the sky as flat and replace spherical harmonic sums with fourier transforms at the temperature ( rather than the 2-point function ) level .",
    "we give some details of this in this appendix , the reader is also referred to zaldarriaga & seljak  ( @xcite ) .    in the flat sky approximation",
