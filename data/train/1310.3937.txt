    "upon the observation of a new boson at a mass around 125 gev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , the higgs precision ( higgcision ) era has just begun .",
    "a study based on a generic framework for the deviations of the couplings from their standard model ( sm ) values shows  @xcite that the sm higgs boson  @xcite provides the best fit to all the most updated higgs data from atlas  @xcite , cms  @xcite , and tevatron  @xcite .",
    "in addition to a number of more or less model - independent studies   @xcite , there are also studies done in the 2hdm  @xcite and supersymmetric  @xcite frameworks . in this work ,",
    "we perform global fits to the general 2hdms ( _ higgcision in 2hdms _ ) closely following the generic framework suggested in ref .",
    "we use the most updated data from the atlas , cms , and the tevatron and include the scenarios with cp - conserving ( cpc ) and cp - violating ( cpv ) couplings . we find that higgcision in 2hdms can be performed very efficiently by using _ only _ 3 parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath0 , as shown later ) , if one can neglect the charged - higgs contribution to the higgs couplings to two photons . to consider the case when the charged - higgs contribution to the @xmath5 couplings is significant",
    ", one may need only one additional parameter .",
    "furthermore , we relax the requirement on the discrete symmetries , which are often imposed on the yukawa couplings to guarantees the absence of tree - level flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc )  @xcite , to see which of the 2hdms is preferred .",
    "we find that the differences in the chi - squares among various types of 2hdms are very small and one can not see any preferences in both the cp - conserving and cp - violating cases .",
    "a number of important findings in this work are :    1 .   the sm provides the best fit in terms of @xmath1-values .",
    "the general 2hdm fits at most improve marginally in the total @xmath6 at the expense of additional parameters though , and so the @xmath1-values do not improve at all ; 2 .",
    "the differences among various types of 2hdms are negligible in fitting the higgs data ; 3 .",
    "the gauge boson coupling @xmath7 is constrained to be close to 1 , which means that the observed higgs boson is responsible for the most part of the electroweak symmetry breaking ; and 4 .",
    "the @xmath0 is constrained to a small value .",
    "finally , we emphasize that future precision measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath0 can provide us with the discriminating power among various types of 2hdms especially when @xmath2 deviates from its sm value @xmath3 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the interactions of the higgs bosons , including deviations in the yukawa couplings and deviations in the loop functions of @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 vertices , as well as the notation used in the analysis . in sec .",
    "iii , we fix the higgs potential and yukawa couplings of the general 2hdms under consideration and describe how to perform higgcision in 2hdms .",
    "we articulate that only 4 fitting parameters are needed if we concentrate on the couplings of the candidate for the 125 gev higgs boson .",
    "we present the results of various fits in sec .",
    "v and conclude in sec .",
    "for the higgs couplings to the sm particles assuming the higgs boson is a generic cp - mixed state without carrying any definite cp ",
    "parity , we follow the conventions and notations of cpsuperh  @xcite in which the higgs couplings to fermions are given as @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the up- and down - type quarks and charged leptons , respectively , and those to the massive vector bosons are @xmath12 in the sm , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . for the loop - induced higgs couplings to two photons , two gluons and @xmath16 , and their relevance to the couplings @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite . without loss of generality , we use the following notation for the parameters in the fits : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote additional loop contributions to the loop factor @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively ; and similarly for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 represents an additional nonstandard decay width of the higgs boson ( e.g. , decay into the lighter higgses ) .",
    "here we assume generation independence and also custodial symmetry between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 bosons .",
    "our analysis is based on the theoretical signal strength which may be approximated as the product @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote the production mechanisms and @xmath31 the decay channels . for explicit expressions of @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ", we again refer to ref .",
    "@xcite , but by noting they are basically given by the ratios of the higgs couplings to the corresponding sm ones .",
    "the general 2hdm potential may be given by  @xcite @xmath34 with the parameterization @xmath35 and denoting @xmath36 and @xmath37 , one may remove @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 from the 2hdm potential using three tadpole conditions . then , including the vacuum expectation value @xmath41 , one may need the following 13 parameters plus one sign : @xmath42\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to fully specify the general 2hdm potential . here",

    "one may take the convention with @xmath49 without loss of generality .",
    "on the other hand , the yukawa couplings are given in the interactions @xmath50 & + & h_l\\ , \\overline{l_r}\\ , l^t\\,(i\\tau_2)\\ , \\left(-\\eta_1^l\\,\\widetilde\\phi_1 -\\eta_2^l\\,\\widetilde\\phi_2\\right ) \\ + \\",
