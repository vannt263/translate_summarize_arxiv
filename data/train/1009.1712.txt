    "exactly soluble lattice - statistical models attract scientific interest as they offer a valuable insight into diverse aspects of cooperative phenomena  @xcite . the mapping technique based on generalized algebraic transformations  @xcite belongs to the simplest mathematical methods , which allow to obtain the exact solution for various statistical models . recently",
    ", this approach has been applied to an interesting diamond - chain model of interacting spin - electron system  @xcite .",
    "this motivated us to start studying a similar spin - electron system on doubly decorated two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices in order to provide a deeper insight into how the mobile electrons influence their magnetic properties  @xcite .",
    "the investigated model system might provide guidance on a magnetic behavior of magnetic metals such as srco@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite , which contain both localized spins and itinerant electrons .",
    "consider a hybrid lattice - statistical model of interacting spin - electron system on doubly decorated 2d lattices ( see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which have one localized ising spin at each nodal lattice site and two delocalized mobile electrons at each couple of decorating sites .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the model can be written as a sum over bond hamintonians @xmath2 , where each bond hamiltonian @xmath3 involves all interaction terms of @xmath4th couple of delocalized electrons @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) represent usual creation and annihilation fermionic operators , respectively , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the standard spin-1/2 operator .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath11 takes into account kinetic energy of mobile electrons , @xmath12 describes the ising interaction between the itinerant electrons and their nearest ising neighbors and @xmath13 denotes the on - site coulomb repulsion . following the rigorous approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one obtains a simple universal equality @xmath14 which establishes an exact mapping relationship between the partition function @xmath15 of the interacting spin - electron system on the doubly decorated 2d lattice and the partition function @xmath16 of the spin-1/2 ising model on the corresponding undecorated lattice of @xmath17 vertices with the coordination number @xmath18 and the effective temperature - dependent nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath19 .",
    "note that the relation ( [ 2.02 ] ) allows direct calculation of all relevant physical quantities to be useful for understanding of magnetic behavior of the considered system .",
    "now , let us proceed to a discussion of the most interesting numerical results obtained for the interacting spin - electron model on doubly decorated 2d lattices with the on - site coulomb repulsion . before doing this",
    ", however , it is noteworthy that the special case of this hybrid system without the on - site repulsion term has already been examined in detail by present authors in the earlier paper  @xcite . the exact results for this particular model revealed that the ground state of the system consists of an interesting four - sublattice quantum antiferromagnetic phase @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath20 is characterized by a perfect nel order of the ising spins situated at the nodal lattice sites and the quantum entanglement of four microstates @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 of itinerant electrons delocalized over decorating lattice sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , whose probability amplitudes depend on a mutual ratio between the hopping term @xmath11 and the ising interaction @xmath12 .      with this background ,",
    "the purpose of the present work is to shed light on how the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath25 affects the spontaneous long - range order to emerge in @xmath20 . for simplicity",
    ", we will further assume the ferromagnetic ising interaction @xmath26 , because the sign change @xmath27 brings just a trivial change in the mutual orientation of the nodal ising spins with respect to their nearest - neighbor electrons .",
    "the deeper insight into the effect of the on - site coulomb repulsion on a probability distribution of four entangled microstates in @xmath20 may be gained from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which shows the abundance probabilities of relevant microstates as functions of @xmath28 for the fixed @xmath29 .      as one",
    "can clearly see from this figure , the abundance probability @xmath30 of the majority microstate @xmath21 monotonically increases upon strengthening the on - site repulsion at the expense of the abundance probabilities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 of minority microstates , until they asymptotically reach the values @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , one may conclude that in the limit of infinitely strong on - site repulsion each decorating lattice site is occupied by just one mobile electron , which prefers the ferromagnetic alignment with respect to its nearest ising neighbor . providing that within the second - order perturbation theory the kinetic term @xmath11 at half - filling is equivalent to the af heisenberg interaction between spins",
    ", one may conclude that for sufficiently strong repulsion , the ground state of the interacting spin - electron system is identical with the one of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg antiferromagnet defined on the same doubly decorated lattice  @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we depict the critical temperature of the spin - electron model on doubly decorated square lattice as a function of the the on - site coulomb repulsion for several values of the kinetic term .",
    "as one can see , the critical temperature monotonically decreases upon strengthening the coulomb repulsion for sufficiently small hopping terms @xmath38 , while for stronger kinetic terms @xmath39 it exhibits a more striking dependence with a pronounced maximum due to a mutual competition between the sufficiently strong hopping term @xmath37 and the coulomb term @xmath28 .",
    "in conclusion , the effect of on - site coulomb repulsion on the ground - state properties and critical behavior of the interacting spin - electron system on doubly decorated 2d lattices have been examined using the generalized decoration - iteration transformation .",
    "the obtained exact results clearly show that the dependence of critical temperature on a strength of the on - site coulomb repulsion basically depends on whether the kinetic term is greater than or less than the boundary value @xmath40",
