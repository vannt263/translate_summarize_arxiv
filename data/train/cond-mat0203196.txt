    "the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance effect in epitaxial manganite thin films has renewed interest in the doped manganite perovskite materials ln@xmath5b@xmath6mno@xmath3 ( ln = trivalent rare - earth ions ; b = divalent alkaline - earth ions ) for potential sensor and magnetic recording applications as well as the need to understand the mechanisms underlying their behavior.@xcite it has been found that properties such as ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath0 , resistivity @xmath7 , and magnetoresistance are sensitive to the epitaxial strain due to lattice mismatch of the film with substrate .",
    "@xcite when the film is grown on the substrate whose lattice parameter is smaller or larger than that of the bulk material , the epitaxial strain is expected to be compressive or tensile , respectively .",
    "compressive strain usually reduces the resistivity and shifts @xmath0 towards the higher temperature .",
    "these effects have been confirmed in la@xmath8ca@xmath9mno@xmath3 films@xcite and la@xmath8sr@xmath9mno@xmath3 films@xcite grown on various substrates .",
    "the observed strain effect is usually interpreted qualitatively within double exchange model , @xcite since the hopping matrix element @xmath10 could be altered by epitaxial strain through changing the mn - o bond length @xmath11 and the mn - o - mn bond angle @xmath12 .",
    "it has been also proposed that the jahn - teller electron - phonon coupling plays an important role in strain effect on @xmath0.@xcite however , recent detailed studies show that compressive strain does not always lead to enhancement of @xmath0,@xcite while the cationic vacancies due to the oxygen annealing significantly enhance the @xmath0 values much higher than any bulk values in the series compounds.@xcite in most cases , tensile strain suppresses ferromagnetism and reduces @xmath0 in manganite films . but some anomalous results have also been reported , showing @xmath0 enhanced by tensile strain . @xcite",
    "most interestingly , there are reports of multiple phase segregation in fully strained epitaxial films.@xcite the ferromagnetic coupling within the metallic regions accounts for the changes of @xmath0 and conductivity .",
    "thus , the strain effect in manganite films is far from being fully understood and challenging .",
    "lightly doped la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath3 shows a great variety of intriguing phenomena originating from a pronounced interplay between spin , lattice , charge , and orbital degrees of freedom . as a result many phenomena like charge order,@xcite orbital order , @xcite and phase separation@xcite have been recently observed in this regime of the phase diagram .",
    "la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 is in the phase boundary of a spin - canted antiferromagnetic insulator and a ferromagnetic insulator.@xcite this material has the lowest @xmath0 among the series compounds,@xcite which makes it possible to perform systematic investigations of the resistivity in the paramagnetic regime over a broad temperature range without using specialized equipment to extend the temperature range .",
    "meanwhile , the pressure derivative of @xmath0 , @xmath13 , in this material is highest among the manganese perovskites.@xcite it has been generally believed that pressure changes @xmath0 and @xmath7 in a similar manner as epitaxial strain .",
    "thus , transport properties , transition temperatures , and phase transitions are expected to be significantly affected by epitaxial strain in the la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 films . moreover ,",
    "these investigations are most important for the understanding of the fruitful phenomena and the use of these films as magnetic devices as well as air electrodes in high - temperature solid oxide fuel cells.@xcite    in this work we investigate the transport properties by measuring resistivity and magnetization of the epitaxial la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 films on srtio@xmath3 .",
    "the data clearly show that the high - temperature resistivity of the films can be well ascribed by a model for small - polaron hopping in the adiabatic limit .",
    "we experimentally find that the small polaronic formation energy @xmath4 decreases with the reduction of the film thickness , which can account for the strain effect on @xmath0 .",
    "we suggest that the electron - phonon coupling is responsible for the strain effect on the high - temperature electronic transport and the ferromagnetic transition temperature .",
    "thin films of la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 were grown using the pulsed laser deposition technique .",
    "the target used had a nominal composition of la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 .",
    "the substrates were ( 100 ) single crystal of srtio@xmath3 .",
    "the laser energy density on the target was 2 mj/@xmath14 and the ablation rate was 5 hz . the substrates were kept at a constant temperature of 850@xmath15c during the deposition which was carried out at a pressure of 0.40 mbar of oxygen .",
    "the films were @xmath16 @xmath17 annealed at 940@xmath15c in oxygen at 1.0 bar for 30 minutes .",
    "this procedure always results in films of high crystalline quality and in very sharp film - substrate interfaces .",
    "the thickness of the films was varied from 200 to 2000 @xmath18 as measured by dektak .",
    "the chemical composition of the films was determined by microprobe analysis , which showed a ( la , sr)/mn ratio of 1:1 and a sr content of @xmath19 .",
    "the structural study was carried out by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) at room temperature by a rigaku x - ray diffractometer with a rotating anode and cu @xmath20 radiation , @xmath21 @xmath18 .",
    "the resistivity @xmath7 was measured from unpatterned samples with sputtered chromium gold contacts using a standard four - probe technique .",

    "the features of the @xmath33 curves are ferromagnetic with @xmath34 emu/@xmath35 at 10 k. the magnetization was taken at 0.5 t to avoid the variation due to magnetic domain rotation at lower fields .",

    "[ fig2 ] , there are few measurements in other manganites films to support this phenomenon",

    "thus , the large enhancement of @xmath0 and @xmath39 in this film should be dominated by compressive strain .",
    "the lack of this enhancement observed previously in la@xmath37ca@xmath38mno@xmath3 thin film may be due to oxygen deficiency .",

    "the results of the temperature dependence of the resistivity are shown in fig .",
    "the resistivity of our films displays semiconducting behavior at high temperatures , and metallic behavior for @xmath42 .",
    "it has an upturn at @xmath36 , and then becomes of semiconducting character .",
    "the neutron scattering study demonstrates that the point of resistivity upturn is consistent with the onset temperature of the polaron order .",
    "@xcite the magnitude of resistivity of our films is smaller than those of the single crystals.@xcite for example , the resistivity of the 2000 @xmath18 film at @xmath43 k is 83.7 @xmath44 cm . note that the compressive strain decreases the resistivity in our thin films .",
    "this behavior is typical for manganites films under compressive strain.@xcite the observed @xmath39 ( defined as the temperature where @xmath45 changes sign ) of @xmath46 k in our films are comparable to those of la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 single crystals.@xcite for films with thicknesses @xmath47 and 2000 @xmath18 , @xmath39 almost coincides with @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xmath39 is significant smaller than @xmath0 for the ultrathin films .",
    "the scenario to correlate with this observation could be the existence of microscopic phase segregation due to the formation of small ferromagnetic clusters , which are large enough to give a magnetic contribution in ultrathin films but not to allow metallic conductivity appearing in zones of ferromagnetic insulating behavior .",
    "the smaller @xmath39 value compared to @xmath0 has reported previously in la@xmath48sr@xmath49mno@xmath3 thin films .",

    "additional increase of resistivity on cooling can be seen at low temperatures proceeded by a minimum at @xmath36 .",
    "the structural data of single crystals show that a phase transformation from a pseudocubic @xmath52 type to an orthorhombic @xmath53 type structure occurs near @xmath36.@xcitethe low - temperature phase is known to be a spin - canted antiferromagnetic phase for @xmath54,@xcite which results from competing antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction between half - filled @xmath55 orbitals along the @xmath56 axis mn - o - mn bonds and ferromagnetic double - exchange interaction via @xmath57 conduction electrons . with the reduction of the film thickness , @xmath36 shifts towards low temperatures and @xmath7 decreases in the insulating low - temperature phase .",
    "it has been reported that @xmath36 increases and @xmath7 decreases under pressure in la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 single crystals.@xcite although @xmath7 behaves in a similar manner under compressive strain and external pressure , the observed variation of @xmath36 is in sharp contrast with the pressure measurements . it has been established@xcite that pressure influences @xmath36 in the same way as an increase in @xmath58 with a maximum within the range @xmath59 for the slightly doped la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath3 . at low - pressures , the thermoelectric power through @xmath36 is sensitive to the charge carrier density .",
    "it is indicated that pressure induces the change of carrier concentration , which should account for the dependence of @xmath36 on pressure .",
    "the growth conditions such as film deposition and oxygen annealing are same for all films studied here .",
    "the carrier concentration in these films should not be different .",
    "therefore , the dependence of @xmath36 on strain is possibly different from the pressure effect on @xmath36 .",
    "an interesting feature is the absence of the jump in resistivity in films near @xmath60 k. the structural analyses on la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 crystals@xcite reveal that the system undergoes another structural transition around characteristic temperature @xmath61 k from an orthorhombic @xmath62 phase having a dynamic jahn - teller distortion to a orthorhombic @xmath53 phase at lower temperatures where jahn - teller distortion becomes static and cooperative .",
    "the jump in resistivity at @xmath63 in single crystals has been reported by urushibara @xmath64 @xmath65@xcite the absence of the jump indicates that the compressive strain in films either suppresses the structural phase transition or shifts @xmath63 towards higher temperatures above 350 k. there is competition between the charge mobility and the structural phase transition in the slightly doped la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath3.@xcite the change tendency of @xmath63 and @xmath36 is usually different under pressure or magnetic field.@xcite in our films , @xmath36 decreases with decreasing film thickness due to the compressive strain .",
    "thus , the increase of @xmath63 is possible under compressive strain .    the preconditions for polaron formation ,",
    "namely , large electron - lattice coupling and low electronic hopping rates , appear to be satisfied for manganites.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have represented @xmath66 versus inverse temperature . a linear behavior is obtained between 165 and 350 k. this is strong support of the mechanism of adiabatic small polaron conduction .",
