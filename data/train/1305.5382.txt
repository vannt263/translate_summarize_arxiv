    "the magnetic properties of the cubic crystal cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 are of great interest for several reasons .",
    "first of all , having the space group @xmath7 without centre of inversion , this crystal becomes a cubic helimagnet below the critical temperature of about 58 k. moreover , it is the first cubic crystal beyond the class of itinerant magnetics with @xmath8 crystal structure @xcite , for which a - phase , associated with skyrmion lattice @xcite , has been recently observed @xcite .",
    "secondly , being an insulator , cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 has magnetoelectric properties @xcite , which provides a new physical significance in comparison with the @xmath8 crystals .",
    "the interconnection between magnetization gradients and electric polarization makes this crystal potentially applicable for data storing devices and spintronics @xcite . and",
    "thirdly , but not finally , the more complex than @xmath8 structure ( 16 magnetic copper atoms in two non - equivalent positions in the unit cell ) makes it an interesting object for studying the spin textures .",
    "most of the known twisted magnetics possess symmetry lower than cubic .",
    "their strong anisotropy orients magnetic helices in special crystallographic directions .",
    "as opposed to them , in cubic magnetics without centre of inversion , the binding between magnetic and crystal structures can be so subtle , that the helix can be easily reoriented along any direction without essential change of its pitch and energy .",
    "nevertheless , at the microscopic level , this seeming freedom is achieved by correlated tilts of discrete magnetic moments tightly bound with atoms in the crystal .",
    "besides , the easier seems to be the phenomenology of the isotropic system as compared with anisotropic one , the more complex appears its description in terms of discrete spins , particularly when the magnetic helix is oriented by the field in some arbitrary direction . as it has been shown recently for the helimagnetics with @xmath8 structure ( mnsi - type ) , this freedom of the helix rotations",
    "is achieved by extra tilts ( or canting ) of the local magnetic moments , which always accompany global spiralling , but are not described in the phenomenological theory . moreover ,",
    "the canting still remains , when the spiralling disappears in strong magnetic field .    as a rule , in papers discussing the spin canting some class of canted antiferromagnetics",
    "is implied @xcite , where small relative tilts of magnetic moments belonging to different sublattices result in appearing of weak magnetization .",
    "the phenomenon is called weak ferromagnetism , and it serves as direct evidence of the canting , because the tilt angles of individual spins are directly proportional to the observed spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the canting in ferromagnetics is less elaborated , and it has been known for many decades that it is more difficult to observe small changes of strong magnetization than small magnetization of weak ferromagnetics . here , a refined experiment would be useful , e.g. on observation of forbidden bragg reflections of antiferromagnetic origin @xcite .",
    "repeating small rotations ( cantings ) of spins belonging to neighbouring atomic planes can result in a global twist of crystal magnetization .",
    "therefore , in chiral ferromagnetics , the twist and the canting are often mistaken for the same thing .",
    "only recently , it was suggested how to distinguish between canting and twist in ferromagnetics @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the canting should always appear when there are more than one magnetic atom in the unit cell .",
    "it leads to coexistence of several spin helices within the helimagnet , which differ by phases and rotational planes ( figure  [ fig : canting ] ) .",
    "it was shown by example of cubic helimagnets with @xmath8 structure that the canting makes contribution to the magnetic energy comparable with that of global spiralling .",
    "therefore , it should be taken into account when calculating propagation number of spin helices from the first principles , i.e. starting from the heisenberg microscopical model of ferromagnetism .",
    "even more intriguing is the fact that , if the dzyaloshinskii  moriya ( dm ) vectors are perpendicular to the bonds between magnetic atoms ( which is predicted by many quantum mechanical models ) , both twist and canting in mnsi - type crystals are determined by the same components of the dm vectors .",
    "the study of the cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 crystal , with its structure different from @xmath8 , also can help us to distinguish between general regularities of twisted cubic magnetics and particularities of the mnsi - type crystals .",
    "the twist and the canting ( by example of a one - dimensional crystal with two magnetic atoms in the unit cell ) .",
    "the canting of spin sublattices leads to the combination of two helices with the same propagation vector and a constant phase shift.,width=264 ]    in this paper , a general theory of the spin canting in cubic helimagnetics is developed , which unifies the cases of the mnsi - type and cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 crystals . a microscopical description of the spin structures is made for the case of weakly non - collinear spins .",
    "the latter means that the angle between neighbouring spins is close to 0 or to @xmath9 , i.e. both the spiralling and canting are small .",
    "it is just the case of the majority of itinerant magnetics with @xmath8 structure ( exemplified by mnsi ) and twisted ferrimagnetic cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 .",
    "we confine ourselves only to the case of the twist induced by the dm interactions ; the case of the twist owing to the frustrated exchange is beyond the scope of our consideration . in section  [ sec :",
    "balance ] , the definition of canting is given .",
    "then , the transition to continuous approximation is performed ( section  [ sec : continuous ] ) , and the density of the magnetic energy is calculated ( section  [ sec : energy ] ) . in section  [ sec : collinear ] , it is shown which simplifications can be made in the case , when , in the absence of the dm interaction , all the spins of the system remain collinear .",
    "we assert that two different kinds of the canting exist in the twisted magnetics .",
    "the first of them is connected with the gradients of the magnetization , and it arises even in the absence of the dm interaction ( in this case the magnetization gradients can be induced by an external influence , e.g. from a surface ) . in order to take this kind of canting into account , it is convenient to use the method of fictitious `` exchange '' coordinates ( section  [ sec : collinear ] )",
    ". then , simple expressions can be found for the macroscopic constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the helix propagation number @xmath10 ( section  [ sec : phenomenological ] ) .",
    "the second kind of canting is induced by the dm interactions .",
    "it can be described in terms of the `` tilt '' vectors , whose symmetry is found to be determined by the symmetry of the crystal ( section  [ sec : collinear ] ) .",
    "the canting of this kind still remains even in the ferromagnetic state , when the helical spin structure is unwound by the external magnetic field .",
    "this residual canting can be measured , using neutron and x - ray diffractions ( see discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] ) . in sections  [ sec :",
    "mnsi ] and [ sec : cu2oseo3 ] , the theory is applied to the cases of mnsi and cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in the classical heisenberg theory of magnetics , the energy of a magnetic structure is written as @xmath11 \\right ) - \\mu_\\mathrm{b } g_i \\mathbf{h } \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_i \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 enumerates all the magnetic atoms , the inner sum ( @xmath13 ) is taken over close neighbours of @xmath12th atom , the coefficient @xmath14 is needed because each bond is included twice in the sum , @xmath15 is the magnetic moment of @xmath12th atom ( @xmath16 is the direction of classical spin , @xmath17 ) , @xmath2 are the isotropic exchange constants , whereas the antisymmetrical exchange is characterized by the dzyaloshinskii ",
    "moriya ( dm ) vectors @xmath3 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is an external magnetic field .",
    "the equation of @xmath12th spin balance can be easily found copying out the part of ( [ eq : e1 ] ) associated with the @xmath12th spin , @xmath21 \\right ) + \\mu_\\mathrm{b } g_i \\mathbf{h } \\right\\ } \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_i \\equiv -\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_i\\ ] ] ( notice the absence of @xmath14 in comparison with ( [ eq : e1 ] ) ) .",
    "it is evident that @xmath22 is minimal , when @xmath23    being of relativistic origin , the dm interaction is considerably weaker than the isotropic exchange , @xmath24 therefore it is convenient to develop a perturbation theory with a small parameter of the order of @xmath25 . in the case of twisted magnetics",
    "we can also neglect the influence of the external magnetic field on canting , supposing that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the field of full `` unwinding '' of the magnetic helix .",
    "indeed , it has been found in @xcite that the energy of canting is of the order of @xmath28 , while the energy of the interaction of canting with an external magnetic field ( @xmath29 ) is determined by the canting of the second order and being proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "it follows from the finding of @xcite that , in ferromagnetics , the canting of the first order has antiferromagnetic character and does not contribute in this part of the magnetic energy .",
    "notice that , accordingly to the elementary phenomenological theory , the field does not affect the helix pitch , which is in a good agreement with experimental data .",
    "neglecting the dm interaction and external magnetic field , equation ( [ eq : si ] ) determines an equilibrium system of spins @xmath31 with @xmath32    the isotropy of the exchange interaction results in that both the structure energy and spin balance remain unchanged , if all the spins rotate as a unit by arbitrary angle relative to immovable atomic structure , or , which is practically the same , if the atomic structure rotates preserving initial spin directions .",
    "the latter understanding is important for a cubic crystal structure , where equivalent atomic positions connect to each other by rotational symmetry transformations .",
    "it is obvious that a spin balance can be achieved , when @xmath33 are equal for all the equivalent positions ( figure  [ fig : equiv ] ) .",
    "here we suppose that the twist is induced only by the dm interactions , and leave the possibility of the pure exchange spiralling outside the scope of our consideration .",
    "notice that such pure exchange twist reveals a threshold behaviour , i.e. it can appear only at some values of the exchange constants .",
    "three magnetic atoms ( green ) in positions connected by rotational symmetry elements , and their nearest magnetic environments . in absence of non - symmetric dm interaction ,",
    "a balance is achieved , when the spins in the equivalent positions ( equally coloured circles ) have the same directions.,width=264 ]    the non - isotropic dm interaction breaks the symmetry of @xmath33 , because dm vectors of equivalent bonds change ( rotate ) with the bond directions .",
    "therefore spin @xmath16 deviates from @xmath33 by a small angle of order of @xmath25 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath34 , this spin change , hereinafter referred to as `` canting '' , in the first approximation is perpendicular to @xmath33 . introducing correction @xmath35 of first order on @xmath25 , we find @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are parallel and perpendicular to @xmath33 components of @xmath35 , correspondingly ; @xmath39 is the canting of @xmath12th spin in the first approximation , and @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath28 change of the spin along @xmath33 ( figure  [ fig : circle ] ) .",
    "deviation of spin @xmath41 from the equilibrium state @xmath42 in presence of non - isotropic dm interaction . the tilt angle @xmath43 .",
    "in a simple approximation the deviation can be decomposed into two parts , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    ", width=264 ]",
    "in cubic crystal without centre of inversion , a constant direction of magnetic moment density vector is energetically unfavourable , and magnetic structure becomes twisted . besides , the strength of the twist is characterized by the same ratio @xmath25 as the canting does . if the magnetic moment density changes slowly along the crystal , a transition can be performed from discrete spins to smooth continuous spin functions @xmath46 , whose number coincides with the number of magnetic atoms in the crystal unit cell .",

    "let us average out ( [ eq : u1 ] ) using the crystal symmetry .",

    "indeed , the energy ( [ eq : e1 ] ) does not depend explicitly on the atomic coordinates , as opposed to expression ( [ eq : e2 ] ) , where they are included in vectors @xmath48 .",
    "obviously , the coordinates should disappear after minimization of the energy , therefore we can choose them arbitrarily , e.g. using condition ( [ eq : xideal ] ) .",

    "they often add to the energy a correction term in the form @xmath101 . yet",
    "a trouble emerges here , namely , the magnetization in some areas can exceed the saturation value @xmath100 .",
    "the form @xmath99 , resulting from the heisenberg model , resolves this difficulty .    because , as is seen from ( [ eq : rho ] ) , @xmath90 are independent of spatial derivatives of @xmath63 , the energy @xmath102 does not contain the derivatives as well .",

    "for example , figure  [ fig : ferro ] shows the canting arrangement in the periodic structure , if the external magnetic field is along the [ 001 ] axis .",

    "for that , the structure is divided into `` strong '' tetrahedra of copper atoms , with the summary magnetic moments being considered as individual classical spins . indeed , as is seen from table  [ 5bonds ] , the bonds 2 and 3 have the maximal absolute values of the exchange interaction constants .",
    "the approximation of strong tetrahedra corresponds to the infinite constants : @xmath247 , @xmath248 .",

    "therefore , @xmath259 then , from ( [ eq : calj])([eq : k ] ) can be calculated @xmath260 mev , @xmath261 mev , and @xmath262 .",

    "in order to calculate @xmath226 in the one - helix model ( without canting ) , the formulae ( [ eq : calj])([eq : k ] ) can be used with real coordinates instead of exchange ones . indeed , in this case , using the data from @xcite , we find @xmath266 , which is very close to the value calculated in @xcite without taking the canting into account . in order to understand this essential difference , notice that , accordingly to ( [ eq : cald ] ) , the phenomenological parameter @xmath267 determining spiralling of the magnetic structure is composed of the scalar products @xmath268 .",
    "it is well known from the superexchange theory , that the dm vectors are approximately perpendicular to the bonds ( see also third column in table  [ bexch ] ) . were the perpendicularity of the dm vectors to the bonds exact ,",
    "the spiralling would be absent on condition that expression ( [ eq : cald ] ) contained vectors @xmath78 with real coordinates .",
    "however , the expression depends on the exchange ones , and , consequently , @xmath5 is a linear combination of differences @xmath269 with coefficients from the dm vector components .",
    "therefore , the exact numerical values of @xmath146 can strongly affect the spiralling , determining both pitch and sense of the magnetic helix .    in table",
    "[ bexch ] , the calculated with the use of ( [ eq : coord ] ) lengths of the `` exchange '' bonds @xmath270 are listed .",
    "as one can see , the lengths @xmath271 of the 2nd and the 3rd bonds are considerably less than the real ones .",
    "it rather justifies the approximation of strong tetrahedra @xcite , in which @xmath272 .",
    "another important factor is the angle between the dm vector and the bond @xmath270 in exchange coordinates . from table",
    "[ bexch ] it is seen that , in accordance with @xcite , the angles @xmath273 are really close to @xmath274 .",

    "moriya one .",
    "it is important here to attend to the calculation accuracy of dm vector projections on the bond directions ( in exchange coordinates ) , because only these projections affect the twist .",
    "if vectors @xmath3 are almost perpendicular to bonds , then their projections on the bond directions are relatively small in size , and even a slight change of their values can have a strong influence on the phenomenological constant @xmath5 and consequently on the propagation number @xmath226 . on the other hand , the isotropic parameters @xmath2 can provide their influence both through the phenomenological constant @xmath4 and the exchange coordinates .",
    "it is noteworthy , that although @xmath2 and @xmath3 decrease with distance , their contributions into the macroscopic parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , accordingly to ( [ eq : calj ] ) and ( [ eq : cald ] ) , are proportional to @xmath279 and @xmath280 , correspondingly .",
    "moreover , the number of neighbours also increases with distance .",
    "thus , for example , there are eight non - equivalent bonds in the second magnetic environment ranging from 5.35 to 5.54  .    as can be seen from ( [ eq : coord ] ) , the maximal deviation of the exchange coordinate from the real one is for @xmath281 , @xmath282 . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that for itinerant magnetics of the mnsi - type in the frame of rkky model , @xmath146 can have practically any value ( we would remind that the ideal coordinates are nothing but some functions of the exchange parameters @xmath2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , some limitation can result from the condition of validity of the theory . in",
    "order to study this we should first understand the origin of the exchange coordinates . when a transition is performed from discrete spins to continuous magnetic moment",
    ", some frustrations appear from the fact that the spins correspond poorly to the values of smooth function ( e.g. helicoid ) in their physical positions .",
    "it is just the cause why , accordingly to equation ( [ eq : u1 ] ) , two kinds of canting can be distinguished : the first one determined by the dm interaction , and the second one connected with spatial derivatives .",
    "the latter is due to existence of several magnetic helices , with small phase shifts from the average single helix .",
    "the appropriate displacement of the magnetic atoms into the fictitious positions ( which does not influence the magnetic energy ) makes all the individual helices confluent , and the canting due to spatial derivatives disappears ( figure  [ fig : exch ] ) .",
    "in fact , the small deviation @xmath269 of the exchange coordinate from the real one for cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 means that the phase shifts of the individual helices are also small , which correlates with the assumption about small cantings between neighbouring spins .",
    "greater phase shifts would mean that we could not already consider the spins as weak non - collinear , and the simplifications of section  [ sec : collinear ] would be impossible .",
    "( a ) in the real spin structure there are several magnetic helices , corresponding to different magnetic atoms in the unit cell , with phase shifts between them .",
    "( b ) when the atoms `` move '' ( arrows ) from the real positions to the fictitious ( exchange ) ones , the phase shifts disappear and the helices become confluent.,width=264 ]    another important property is the sense of the magnetic chirality . in the case when a twist arises from a spontaneous break of symmetry , the helix sense can be plus or minus with equal probability and in each case it is casual . in contrast , for the magnetics without centre of inversion , exemplified by mnsi , cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 and other crystals , the sense of the magnetic chirality correlates with the structural one .",
    "thus , in pure mnsi , the left - handed atomic structure results in the left - handed magnetic helix @xcite . besides , the chiral interlink in mnsi - type helimagnetics is found to be strongly dependent on their atomic composition @xcite . in the present work , using the magnetic data from @xcite , we obtain @xmath283 , i.e. the helicoid is right for the structure described in @xcite and used in simulations of @xcite . recently , this important result has been experimentally proved by dyadkin _",
    "_ @xcite .    in the first approximation ,",
    "the cantings , being only small corrections to spins , are perpendicular to the latters . consequently , the cantings of all @xmath284 magnetic atoms in the unit cell are determined by @xmath285 variables .",
    "thus , for cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 the number of canting components amounts to 32 per unit cell .",
    "surprisingly , that , owing the ( tetrahedral ) symmetry of the crystal , we can make with a considerably lower number of parameters in order to describe the local magnetic structure : four exchange coordinates @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 , and four tilt vector components @xmath290 , @xmath291 , @xmath292 , @xmath293 . for mnsi - type helimagnetics",
    "there are only two parameters : @xmath146 and @xmath294 .    in ( [ eq : rho2 ] ) , the values of tilt vectors @xmath295 are calculated with the use of energetic parameters @xmath163 , @xmath164 from @xcite .",
    "in addition to the propagation number @xmath226 , given by ( [ eq : k ] ) , these , characterizing the canting , vectors are the experimentally observed parameters of the magnetic structure . in @xcite",
    "the conditions were proposed of a diffraction experiment to find the canting in the mnsi - type helimagnets . because the magnetic atoms in these crystals are situated at the special positions @xmath91 , the tilt vectors are defined by only one parameter @xmath294 , which is proposed to be found in the measurement of the `` forbidden '' bragg reflection @xmath296 , @xmath297 in the unwound by magnetic field structure . in the general case of cubic helimagnets with almost collinear spins ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic ( canting ) part of the structure factor is determined by the vector @xmath298 where @xmath299 is a reflection vector , and summation is taken over all magnetic atoms in the unit cell .",
    "in particular , for the copper atoms in the general positions @xmath92 and the pure magnetic reflection @xmath296 , @xmath297 , this sum has the view @xmath300 it is obvious that , in order to find all components of tilt vectors @xmath295 for magnetic atoms in all non - equivalent positions , several forbidden reflections with different @xmath301 should be measured .",
    "notice that , as far as the measurable parameters @xmath226 , @xmath295 are determined by greater number of constants @xmath2 , @xmath3 , the problem of finding of the latter from experimental data is unsolvable in general . at the best",
