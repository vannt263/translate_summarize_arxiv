    "gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) are cosmic explosions that release an extreme amount of energy in a very short time . as it was already noticed in the 1980s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and became more obvious later , grbs form two distinct populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the short and long grbs ( sgrbs and lgrbs , respectively ) , defined at first approximation on the basis of the burst duration ( sgrbs lasting less than @xmath2 in the observer frame ) , and likely corresponding to two different progenitors .    the merger of a double neutron star ( ns - ns ) or a neutron star ",
    "black hole ( ns - bh ) binary system is currently the leading model for sgrbs .",
    "the events predicted by this model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are expected to have comparable time scale and energy release to those observed in sgrbs . in such systems ,",
    "the delay between binary formation and merging is driven by the gravitational wave inspiral time , which is strongly dependent on the initial system separation .",
    "some systems are thus expected to drift away from the star - forming regions in which they formed , before merging takes place .",
    "simulations @xcite show that a large fraction of the merging events should take place in the outskirts or even outside the galaxies , in low density environments .",
    "a much faster evolutionary channel has been proposed @xcite , leading to merging in only @xmath3 , when most systems are still immersed in their star - forming regions .",
    "the above scenarios are based on `` primordial '' binaries , i.e. , systems that were born as binaries . alternatively",
    ", a sizeable fraction of ns - ns systems may form dynamically by binary exchange interactions in globular clusters during their core collapse @xcite . the resulting time delay between star formation and merging",
    "would be dominated by the cluster core - collapse time and thus be comparable to the hubble time @xcite .",
    "merger scenario differs from the collapse of a massive star , which is believed to be associated with long duration grbs ( lgrbs ) .",
    "these two types of progenitors produce different outcomes when exploding as grbs . at variance with lgrbs",
    ", we have no `` smoking gun '' ( like supernova signatures ) to identify the nature of the progenitors of sgrbs .",
    "however , sgrbs are not distinguished from lgrbs only by their duration , but also by other observed properties . if we consider the prompt emission , negligible spectral lag @xcite and hard spectra @xcite are common for sgrbs . as opposed to lgrbs ,",
    "for which the isotropic equivalent gamma - ray energy , @xmath4 , is of the order of @xmath5 and for which the host galaxies are typically dwarf galaxies with high star formation rate @xcite , sgrbs are typically less energetic ( @xmath4 is of the order of @xmath6 ) , they occur in both early- and late - type galaxies with lower star formation rate and are associated with an old stellar population @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sgrbs have been found to be inconsistent with the @xmath7 correlation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the afterglows of sgrbs tend to be significantly fainter on average than those of lgrbs @xcite .",
    "this is believed to be a consequence of the energetics and the surrounding environment @xcite . as shown in @xcite , a powerful tool to characterise",
    "the grb environment is the study of their x - ray absorbing column densities . by a systematic analysis of lgrbs with known redshift promptly observed by the _",
    "swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , @xcite found clear evidence that lgrb x - ray afterglows are heavily absorbed and occur in dense environments , as expected in the context of a massive stellar progenitor .",
    "in this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of the full sample of sgrbs with robust redshift determination , promptly observed from the burst occurrence , and without the autonomous slew delay due to an observing constraint or due to a low merit value .",
    "] by the _ swift _ xrt up to january 2011 . for all these events we derived the intrinsic x - ray column densities .",
    "our findings are then compared to the results of @xcite obtained for lgrbs , with the aim of checking if the surrounding environment of these two classes of events is different and if this is perhaps related to the type of progenitor ( as already discussed by @xcite ) , as well as to various sgrbs properties ( redshift , duration , host galaxy offset and normalised host galaxy offset ) .",
    "in section [ sect : data ] , we present the analysis of x - ray data taken from the _ swift _ xrt and describe how our sample was built . in section [",
    "sect : results ] , we perform various analyses on our sample and discuss the results .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section [ sect : conclusion ] .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a standard cosmology with parameters : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "we collected the information on the @xmath1 of the fluence in gamma - rays ( in this case , in the @xmath11 energy band ) is detected . ] in the observer s frame from the _",
    "swift_-bat refined analysis gcn circulars , together with the properties in gamma regime ( spectral hardness and spectral lag ) for all grbs detected with the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) until january 2011 .",
    "we consider all grbs classified as short in the swift - bat refined analysis gcn circulars@xmath12 , where additional properties in the gamma regime ( apart from @xmath1 ) , such as the lack of a spectral lag and the hardness ratio are used to assess the short nature of a grb .",
    "these criteria enable to include in our sample also sgrbs with an extended emission ( ee ) , for which @xmath1 can be well above @xmath13 .",
    "we selected the events observed by the _ swift _ xrt and obtained a list of @xmath14 sgrbs .",
    "to exclude any observational biases , we checked the time delay between the bat trigger and the start of the observations by the xrt .",
    "we found that for @xmath15 sgrbs the xrt observations started with significant delay of hours or even days after the bat trigger due to observing constrains .",
    "we eliminated these sgrbs and ended up with @xmath16 sgrbs . among these , @xmath17 had no x - ray afterglow detected and @xmath18 had an x - ray afterglow too faint to perform any spectral analysis ( see section [ subsect : analysis ] ) . also these @xmath19 sgrbs have been excluded from our analyses .",
    "for the remaining @xmath20 sgrbs ( see table [ tab : he_properties ] for the complete list ) we retrieved the redshift information from the literature .",
    "we used only redshifts that are robust , meaning that an optical afterglow ( oa ) was detected and found to lie within the host galaxy s light with a sub - arcsecond precision ( so that the association between a host galaxy and a grb is clear ) , and that the spectrum of the associated host galaxy was recorded .",
    "we obtained robust redshifts for @xmath15 sgrbs , mainly from the gcn circulars archive or from published papers .",
    "we put the remaining @xmath21 sgrbs to redshift @xmath22 , to extend our analysis on sgrbs intrinsic x - ray absorption with the obtained lower limits .",
    "the sample of @xmath15 sgrbs with robust redshifts includes also @xmath23 grbs for which the classification as a sgrb is still debated ; grb  060614 was a supernova - less grb at @xmath24 down to very deep optical limits , with spectral lag typical for sgrbs , but with a @xmath1 of @xmath25 and time - averaged spectral properties similar to lgrbs ( @xcite ) . the possibility that this event is a sgrb with an ee was also suggested ( @xcite ) .",
    "grb  090426 can be classified as a sgrb based on its @xmath1 , but the spectral and energy properties are more similar to those of lgrbs ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , grb  100724a can be classified as a sgrb based on its @xmath1 , but spectral lag and hardness of the spectrum point towards a lgrb classification @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainty in the classification , we do not consider also these @xmath23 grbs in our analyses and thus end up with @xmath0 sgrbs with robust redshift determination .",
    "another selection criterion for sgrbs could be the inconsistency with the @xmath7 correlation ( @xcite ) , in which case one additional grb could be considered short : grb  060505 ( see also @xcite ) . however , grb  060505 was not observed promptly by the _",
    "swift _ xrt and so we did not include it in our analyses .    for the sake of simplicity throughout the paper we name as sample the sample of @xmath0 sgrbs with robust redshift determination ( presented in table [ tab : sample ] ) , and as sample the sample of @xmath21 sgrbs without robust redshift determination ( presented in table [ tab : sample_lowerlimits ] ) ."
