    "<S> the lower qd is slightly small , so its energy difference between ground state and first excited state is larger than that of the upper one . from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we know that for qd separation @xmath1 nm the tunneling coupling between the two dots is weak and the qd system can be discussed in terms of a simplified single - particle picture@xcite . applying an electromagnetical field we can excite one electron from the valence to the conduction band in the lower dot which can in turn tunnel to the upper dot . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1(c ) shows this transport . </S>",
    "<S> using this configuration the hamiltonian of the system in the electric dipole approximation reads as follows @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy of level @xmath4 of the quantum dots , and @xmath5 @xmath6 are projection operators . </S>",

    "<S> the density matrix elements of the system evolve according to the liouville equation @xcite , @xmath13-\\frac{1}{2}\\{\\gamma , \\rho\\}.\\ ] ] in what follows we assume a diagonal relaxation matrix @xmath14 , and choose the relaxation rates for off - diagonal element of the density matrix as @xmath15 , and then @xmath16 @xmath17 as the lower quantum dot is initially in the ground state @xmath18 , @xmath19 on substituting these initial conditions into ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and making the substitutions , @xmath20 after the substitution , this set of equation can be solved , for example , by first writing in the matrix form @xcite , @xmath21 with @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> then integrating @xmath27 we yield @xmath28 and @xmath29 from eq.(9 ) and eq.(10 ) , we have @xmath30 therefore , the electric polarizability @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the density of the double quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic susceptibility @xmath34 is expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the magnetic dipole matrix element and @xmath37 is the speed of light in vacuum . in eq.(13 ) , we have used the relation @xmath38 between the envelopes of magnetic and electric fields , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and then we have @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 the results for the real and imaginary parts of the relative electric permittivity @xmath44 and the relative magnetic permeability @xmath45 as a function of @xmath8 with three different detunings ( @xmath46 ) are depicted in figure 2 . in the figure , we consider @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xcite , @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xcite , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . from fig.2 ( a ) and ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that the curves of the real and imaginary part of @xmath44 are symmetrical when @xmath8 varies from -0.5 to 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 ( c ) and ( d ) show that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath45 are almost symmetrical . for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , </S>",
    "<S> the real parts of relative conductivity and permittivity are both negative . </S>",
    "<S> this means a dnim is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> in other cases , @xmath56 or @xmath57 , one can achieve a snim . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the influence of detuning on the relative conductivity and permittivity . as the detuning @xmath58 increases from @xmath59 to @xmath60 </S>",
    "<S> , the resonance peaks will enhance . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , a small detuning is preferred in such a quantum dot system .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 demonstrates the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index @xmath61 and the ratio @xmath62 as a function of the tunneling with @xmath46 . </S>",

    "<S> the low - loss negative index materials are desired . </S>",
    "<S> the curve of @xmath63 shows that the refractive index can be adjusted and controlled from -5 to 3 continuously for @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath8 is changed in @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the real part of refractive index will be negative . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath62 curve shows that the very low loss and the negative refractive index may be obtained at some point near @xmath67 for @xmath64 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the negative index of refraction can be obtained by means of voltage - controlled the coupled quantum dots system such as the vertically self - organized inas quantum dots . as the bias voltage is changed , the refractive index can be adjusted continuously from negative to positive for some fixed detunings and simultaneously the loss of light in the system will be small . </S>",
    "<S> the snim and the dnim can be achieved only by simply changing the external bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that our prediction will be observed in the near future experiment .    </S>",
