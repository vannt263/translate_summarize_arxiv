    "current astronomical observations on cosmological scales ( cmb anisotropy @xcite , supernovae @xcite and sdss@xcite ) reveal that our universe is spatially flat , with about two thirds of the energy content resulting from what is referred to as dark energy .",
    "this energy has a negative pressure to account for the accelerated expansion of the universe . while , on smaller , galactic scales , the rotational curves of galaxies strongly indicate that the biggest contributions to their mass density arises from non - luminous matter , which has given rise to speculations on the existence of dark matter@xcite .    on the other hand , it is also interesting to inquire if we can solve the current observational puzzles , both dark matter and dark energy , by modifying einstein gravity in spite of its many successes , in particular , the solar system tests .",
    "mond theory is a striking modification of the newtonian laws of motion and explains the rotational curves with amazing accuracy@xcite without introducing any dark matter .",
    "after some initial problems , a consistent relativistic extension of the mond theory has recently been proposed by bekenstein@xcite , which has spurred extensive studies on its successes and pitfalls@xcite . in that extension ,",
    "general relativity has been modified by including two scalar fields ( one dynamical while the other is non - dynamical ) , one vector field .",
    "in addition , the theory contains one arbitrary function whose form is dictated in part by its primary purpose , i.e. , to address the data on the rotational curves of galaxies , or equivalently , the dark matter problem .",
    "consistency with data from the bullet clusters@xcite indicates that ev scale hot neutrinos must also be included as explicit dark matter candidate@xcite .",
    "the remarkable features of this theory are that it can explain the galaxy rotational curves without introducing dark matter ( just as its non - relativistic counterpart , mond theory ) and at the same time reduce to general relativity in the appropriate limits .",
    "the price one pays is the additional complication of the whole system : two scalar fields , one vector field and gravitational field .    a natural question to ask is if the new framework also works for cosmology",
    "can it help to tackle the dark energy problem ?",
    "we will show in this paper that under appropriate conditions , the scalar field could mimic the behavior of the dark energy models@xcite . specifically , in the `` slow roll '' regime , it will be seen to reduce to the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "although the current formulation of teves is still not as mature as the dark matter models , it has the potential , to naturally solve the cosmic puzzles currently explained by dark energy and dark matter without invoking either of them explicitly@xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief outline of gravity in the teves framework . following bekenstein@xcite ,",
    "the action for the whole system could be written as @xmath3    where @xmath4    @xmath5\\sqrt{-g } d^4 x\\ ] ]    @xmath6 } \\mathfrak{u}_{[\\beta,\\nu ] } -2(\\lambda / k)(g^{\\mu\\nu}\\mathfrak{u}_\\mu \\mathfrak{u}_\\nu + 1)\\big]\\sqrt{-g } d^4 x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath7    are the actions for gravity , scalar field , vector field and luminous matter respectively . in the framework of teves , there are two different frames , physical frame corresponding to the `` real universe '' and einstein frame .",
    "the metric in physical frame ( @xmath8 ) relates that in einstein frame ( @xmath9 ) by @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is a timelike 4-vector field , @xmath2 and @xmath12 are respectively the dynamical and the non - dynamical scalar fields , f is a free function to be specified by dynamics while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two positive dimensionless parameters .",
    "varying the action , one can arrive at the following equations of motion for the vector , scalar and gravitational fields @xcite :    @xmath15}{}_{;\\beta}+\\mathfrak{u}^\\alpha \\mathfrak{u}_\\gamma \\mathfrak{u}^{[\\gamma;\\beta]}{}_{;\\beta}\\right)+ 8\\pi g\\sigma^2 \\big[\\mathfrak{u}^\\beta\\phi_{,\\beta}\\,g^{\\alpha\\gamma}\\phi_{,\\gamma}+ \\mathfrak{u}^\\alpha ( \\mathfrak{u}^\\beta\\phi_{,\\beta})^2\\big ] \\nonumber   \\\\ & = & 8\\pi g ( 1-e^{-4\\phi } ) \\big[g^{\\alpha\\mu } \\mathfrak{u}^\\beta   \\tilde t_{\\mu\\beta } + \\mathfrak{u}^\\alpha \\mathfrak{u}^\\beta \\mathfrak{u}^\\gamma \\tilde t_{\\gamma\\beta}\\big ] \\label{vectoreq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath16    @xmath17_{;\\beta}= kg\\big[g^{\\alpha\\beta } + ( 1+e^{-4\\phi } ) \\mathfrak{u}^\\alpha \\mathfrak{u}^\\beta\\big ] \\tilde t_{\\alpha\\beta}. \\label{s_equation}\\ ] ]    @xmath18 + \\theta_{\\alpha\\beta } \\label{gravitationeq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 \\label{tau } \\nonumber \\\\ & -&{\\frac{1}{4}}g \\ell^{-2}\\sigma^4 f(kg\\sigma^2 )   g_{\\alpha\\beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath20 } \\mathfrak{u}_{[\\nu,\\beta ] } -\\frac{1}{4 } g^{\\sigma\\tau}g^{\\mu\\nu}\\mathfrak{u}_{[\\sigma,\\mu ] } \\mathfrak{u}_{[\\tau,\\nu]}\\,g_{\\alpha\\beta}\\big)- \\lambda \\mathfrak{u}_\\alpha\\mathfrak{u}_\\beta \\label{theta}\\ ] ]    @xmath21 is the energy momentum tensor of ordinary matter in the physical coordinate system . @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "in a cosmological setting , the symmetries of the frw universe will simplify the above equations considerably .",
    "it is worth recalling here an underlying assumption in such applications .",
    "one interprets the fields in the problem , say the scalar field , as consisting of both a spatially homogenous ( time dependent ) part and an inhomogeneous one . on cosmological scales",
    "the spatially inhomogeneous part may be neglected in the first approximation while at galactic scales , the inhomogeneous part plays a prominent role and the homogenous part is negligible ( quasi - static approximation ) .",
    "henceforth , we will restrict ourselves to cosmological scales , more specifically to the flat universe case , and consider the line element :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that the physical frame and einstein frame become the same once the @xmath27 is constant 1 .",
    "the vector field in this case could be chosen as @xmath28 and the scalar field depends only on time @xmath29 . in einstein frame , the equations of motion and the field equations have simpler forms though their dynamical evolution are essentially the same as those in physical frame ( they are related by a non - singular transformation ) .",
    "so , in this section , we will analyze the dynamics of the system in einstein frame .",
    "@xmath30    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 are respectively the density and pressure of non - relativistic matter .",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are the effective energy density and pressure of the scalar field @xmath2 , defined as :    @xmath36}{4\\ell^2k^2 g}\\\\\\nonumber p_{\\phi}=\\frac{\\mu \\dot{\\phi}^2}{k g}-\\frac{\\mu^2}{4\\ell^2k^2 g}f(\\mu)=\\frac{\\mu^2[f(\\mu)+\\mu f'(\\mu)]}{4\\ell^2k^2 g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 relates to @xmath38 via the @xmath12 equation ( eq.[sigma eq ] ) :    @xmath39    here we need to emphasize , as suggested in @xcite , that the above definitions are held in the effective sense due to the fact that @xmath40 and @xmath41 terms contain @xmath2 .",
    "but in the `` slow roll '' regime ( @xmath42 as we will see later ) , they are well defined as the @xmath2 is merely a constant factor .",
    "the equation of motion of the scalar field @xmath2 in a frw background is given by    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "it is worth nothing that , under the specific form of @xmath1 we choose in eq.([bfform ] ) , eq.([scalar ] ) is consistent with the `` slow roll '' approximation @xmath45 under two different situations : first , as in the usual scalar field dark energy dynamical system , the matter density @xmath40 decreases to zero at late times , which leads to a @xmath34 dominated universe ; second , @xmath46 , which lead to a universe with both @xmath40 and @xmath34 . in next section",
    ", we consider the second possibility when fitting the model to the supernovae data . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume that @xmath38 varies slowly , then we can consider the two energy components to be approximately adiabatic , and energy momentum conservation leads to    @xmath47    where the subscript @xmath48 denotes @xmath49 and @xmath2 . to get a closed system of equations",
    ", we also need to specify the equation of state of the energy / matter content .",
    "this equation of state is specified by @xmath50 , which is 0 for non - relativistic matter . while for the scalar field",
    ", this equation of state is given by its equation of motion , i.e.,eq.([scalar ] ) which can be expressed as ,    @xmath51    in the `` slow roll '' regime , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is worth noting that from eq.([eofs scalar ] ) , the equation of state could approach @xmath54 from either greater than -1 ( quintessence case ) or less than -1(phantom case ) if we choose the form of @xmath1 appropriately . in this paper , we focus on the case with @xmath55 .",
    "eqs.([friedman eq]-[acceleration eq ] ) are expressed in terms of the scale factor in the einstein picture . in the following",
    ", we will continue to work in einstein frame to investigate the dynamics of the scalar field .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear now that we will get the evolution of the whole dynamical system if the form of @xmath1 is specified .",
    "however , at present there are no theoretical arguments in favor of any specific choice , thereby providing a lot of freedom in this regard .",
    "the constraints on the form of @xmath1 are phenomenological in nature motivated by the condition that the correct physics is obtained .",
    "besides the toy model @xmath1 suggested by bekenstein , there are some others forms suggested to account for the better fit to data@xcite . in this section",
    ", we will consider the the choice of the form of @xmath1 that will lead to an acceptable cosmology in addition to accommodating the mond theory and newton s law . from eq.([rho and p ] ) , the positive energy condition , @xmath56 and the non - vanishing of @xmath34 as @xmath57 may restrict the freedom in the choice of the form of @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , the existence of mond and newtonian limits also give constraints on the form of @xmath1 as@xcite    @xmath58    with @xmath59 an arbitrary function of @xmath37 with the requirement of non - vanishing @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the case proposed by bekenstein@xcite .",
    "therefore , we suggest a form of @xmath1 that meets the above requirements as @xmath62}{\\mu^2}+\\frac{\\alpha}{\\mu^2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "when @xmath64 , the above reduces to the form in@xcite .",
    "then , from eq.([sigma relation ] ) , we can obtain the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 as @xmath65    for a consistent cosmology , we require @xmath66 . note also that @xmath67 when @xmath68 , for which the energy density eq.([rho and p ] ) becomes @xmath69 and the equation of state reduces to , @xmath70 at late times , which corresponds to a de sitter phase .",
    "this not only provides an acceptable cosmological state but also ensures the consistency of our previous assumption @xmath45 .",
    "next , we show that such a phase corresponds to a dynamical de sitter attractor@xcite . to do this",
    ", we introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 a scaling constant of dimension @xmath29 .",
    "we can rewrite the eqs.([friedman eq]-[conservation ] ) in terms of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 and linearize them around the critical point @xmath78 , then , we arrive at the following system of equations    @xmath79    it is easy to see that the eigenvalues of the coefficients matrix of eq.([neweq ] ) are @xmath80 which indicates that the critical point is stable , i.e. a dynamical attractor .",
    "one comes to the same conclusion by noting that @xmath67 leads to a minimum of the energy density @xmath34 . in figs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we plot the numerical results for the dynamical system defined above .",
    "note that our intention here is merely to illustrate the possibility of a consistent cosmology and not to fit the exact observational data .",
    "so , for convenience , we have set the parameter @xmath81 and the rest to unity .",
    "since the attractor corresponds to all @xmath2 with @xmath67 , we can choose @xmath82 so that @xmath83 , which is indicated by the previous discussion . in our numerical analysis",
    ", we chose @xmath84 and the initial @xmath38 from 0.001 to 0.005 with an increment of 0.001 .",
    "we should point out that the above conclusion wo nt change even if we choose other values for @xmath2 .",
    "then the physical frame and einstein frame are different by a factor of @xmath85 . in fig .",
    "( 3 ) , we plot the corresponding evolution of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 with respect to @xmath37 given the form of @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ bfform ] ) .",
    "the analysis in preceding section is carried out in the einstein frame .",
    "but we need to work in physical frame if we want to compare the theory with observation data .",
    "the two frames are mathematically equivalent to each other although the physical interpretations are different . with a simple transformation",
    ", one could convert the the equations from einstein frame to physical frame . under the `` slow roll '' approximation(@xmath88 ) , the system can be casted as :    @xmath89    @xmath90    @xmath91    where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath92 and we have used @xmath93 and @xmath94 under the condition @xmath42 .    in the spirit of mond , @xmath95 is the density of baryons . comparing eq.([neweq1 ] ) to the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology , we can find that the term @xmath96 plays the equivalent role of non - relativistic matter ( baryons and dark matter ) .",
    "that is to say , @xmath97 can be considered as an `` effective '' dark matter density .",
    "we introduce @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 as the energy density fraction of baryon , dark energy and non - relativistic matter respectively , where @xmath101 is the critical energy density . from eq.([sigma relation ] ) , one can observe that for any choice of @xmath1 , @xmath37 is a constant as @xmath42 and therefore @xmath34 is constant in the `` slow roll '' regime . as a result , the above system could be reduced to @xmath0cdm universe with the relation @xmath102    from the discussion in the previous section , we know that @xmath67 with @xmath2 at any value is a dynamical attractor . from eq.([relation ] ) , we can fix the @xmath2 value via observation , i.e. the ratio of @xmath103 . from big bang nucleosynthesis@xcite",
    ", we can give a constraint on the baryon density ( @xmath95 and hence @xmath104 ) , while from snia@xcite , we can constrain the total density of non - relativistic matter(@xmath96 and hence @xmath105 ) . combining the two",
    ", we can give a constraint on @xmath2 as @xmath106 and the results are shown in fig.(4 ) .",
    "in this paper , we show a possible late time background @xmath0cdm like cosmology in the framework of teves theory by choosing the @xmath1 as a specific form that also meets the requirements of newtonian and mond limits .",
    "we show the dynamical system has a late time de sitter behavior and the scalar field at the de sitter attractor should be @xmath107 so as to be in agreement with current astronomical observations .    on the other hand , the framework of the teves theory involves an arbitrary function in addition to many parameters as well as auxiliary fields .",
    "this not only provides much freedom in matching the theory to observations , but also adds uncertainties .",
    "clearly , they must be constrained from further phenomenological investigations of the testable predications of the theory .",
    "it would be interesting to see if the model can be made compatible with all the astronomical data with a unique choice for the arbitrary function .",
    "are there any theoretical constraints on this function ?",
    "the analysis in this paper is aimed at suggesting a possibility to reduce the complicated dynamical system of teves into the customary @xmath0cdm under slow roll approximation and thus get some feedback from the cosmological observational constraints on @xmath108 .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath1 , though without any deep theoretical basis , phenomenologically explains both dark matter and dark energy in the same framework .",
    "it remains to be checked in future how this form of the function @xmath1 can be embedded in the larger context of an appropriate function that explains all the data .",
