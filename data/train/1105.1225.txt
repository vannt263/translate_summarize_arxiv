    "the question is now , when the voltage probe is included in the ab interferometer , is the phase symmetry broken due to the voltage ( electrochemical potential ) fluctuation of the voltage probe in the nonlinear transport regime ?",

    "the coherent indirect coupling in a laterally coupled double quantum dot characterizes the coherence between two quantum dots .",
