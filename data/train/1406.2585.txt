    "in the cosmological evolution of baryons in the universe are predicted to have left imprints in the spectrum of the cosmic radio background .",
    "the primordial gas was predominantly hydrogen . at cosmic times between 0.13 to 1.35 myr the expansion of the universe resulted in a transformation of the state of the hydrogen from highly ionized to almost completely neutral . in this recombination epoch",
    "the trickle of bound electrons down atomic states adds recombination lines to the radiation content .",
    "this forest of recombination lines is expected to be detectable today as a ripple in the spectrum of the cosmic radio background [ 1,2 ] .",
    "subsequently , following the formation of the first collapsed objects  which may be massive population iii stars or ultra - dwarf galaxies  the neutral recombined hydrogen gas is irradiated by first light .",
    "this energetic uv and x - ray radiation transforms the level populations in the hydrogen 21-cm spin flip transition , alters the strength of the coupling between these levels and the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "it also heats the gas thus altering the kinetic temperature and finally results in a reionization of the intergalactic hydrogen . the interaction between these spin - flip levels with the cosmic microwave background changes over cosmic time resulting in spectral distortions at frequencies below 200  mhz where the redshifted 21-cm transition appears [ 3 ] .",
    "these spectral features caused by events during the epochs of recombination and reionization as well as relatively wider spectral distortions in the cosmic microwave background that arise from energy injection in the early universe  followed by partial or saturated comptonization  are all orders of magnitude smaller in brightness compared to the brightness of the radio sky .",
    "therefore , their detection requires development of purpose - built sensitive spectral radiometers .",
    "previous work in this direction includes proposals for antenna elements [ 4 ] and receiver system designs [ 5 ] as well as space missions [ 6 ] .",
    "these have been for single element total power spectral radiometers .",
    "some systems have been deployed in remote sites ; edges [ 7 ] , sci - hi [ 8 ] , bighorns [ 9 ] and saras [ 10 ] have reported results of observations .",
    "some of these have yielded outcomes of scientific value ; however , they have all been limited by systematic errors and methods that reduce these are critical to progress in this research .",
    "a limiting factor in absolute measurements of the spectrum of the sky with a spectral radiometer is unwanted additive contributions generated within the receiver electronics .",
    "radiometers to date rely on switching schemes to cancel these .",
    "most often the input to the receiver is switched between the sensor of the sky electromagnetic radiation and a load that provides a reference spectrum .",
    "another common technique is the use of correlation receivers in which the signal from the sensor is split into two parts , amplified in separate receiver chains and a cross correlation spectrum computed between the two arms .",
    "this nominally eliminates the receiver noise contributions because their noise voltages are statistically independent .",
    "absolute measurements of the cosmic radio background using a single antenna element as the sensor of the sky radiation will always include emissions from the resistive losses in the antenna and associated balun . additionally , although switching schemes and correlation receivers do cancel internal sources of receiver noise to a large extent , accuracy in spectral measurements is limited by small - magnitude changes in system bandpass , impedance matching in switching schemes and multi - path propagation of internal noise .",
    "these manifest in the measurement as uncalibrated spectral structure that often takes the form of spectral ripples with a range of periods .",
    "radio interferometers have the advantage of being unresponsive to additive noise contributions arising from ohmic loss in antennas as well as noise in amplifiers and receiver chains .",
    "this is because these components , which are generated in different arms of an interferometer , are uncorrelated .",
    "however , interferometers are also almost completely insensitive to the uniform sky brightness and hence unsuitable for absolute measurement of the cosmic radio background and its spectrum .",
    "a way to retain the advantages of interferometers and make absolute measurements of spectral structure in the uniform sky brightness is to construct a space beam splitter that divides and directs the incident sky power into two antennas that form an interferometer pair .",
    "the interferometer then responds to , and provides a measurement of , the common mode power .",
    "we present below this concept , which we call a ` zero - spacing interferometer ' . the sections that follow develop the design of the electromagnetic space beam splitter for this configuration .",
    "the system design of the zero - spacing interferometer will be presented in a subsequent manuscript .",
    "the configuration of a zero - spacing interferometer that responds to the mean cosmic radio background is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : screen ] . a vertical sheet that is an electromagnetic beam splitter",
    "is placed at the geometric center of a pair of antennas , which are placed at a common height above ground .",
    "the antennas are frequency independent and their radiation patterns are directed on the two sides of a common portion of the vertical sheet . the ground below the antennas and vertical sheet is covered with absorber tiles to make the antenna pattern on the sheet independent of frequency .",
    "radiation from throughout the sky above is incident on the vertical sheet from either side .",
    "since the sheet is a beam splitter , all incident radiation is partially transmitted and partly reflected .",
    "each antenna , therefore , receives sky em radiation transmitted through the beam splitter from the far side as well as reflected off the beam splitter from the near side .",
    "the fields sensed by the antennas are amplified and cross - correlated and the spectral distribution of the cross power spectrum is a measurement of the spectral distribution of the absolute sky brightness .",
    "the antenna pair forms an interferometer that is potentially sensitive to uniform sky brightness ; therefore , we refer to this configuration as a ` zero - spacing interferometer ' .",
    "it is of interest to first compute the transmission and reflection properties of the beam splitter that would maximize the sensitivity to this component .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : screen ] , @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the em waves from the sky that are incident on the two sides of the beam splitter and @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the complex reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "the signals sensed by each of the two antennas , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are vector sums of reflected and transmitted signals : @xmath8 and @xmath9 cross - correlation of these antenna signals gives the measurement : @xmath10 since the two incident beams @xmath2 and @xmath3 are from different sky directions they are uncorrelated and hence the last two terms in the above equation average to zero .",
    "the product becomes @xmath11 equation  [ equal_split ] is the measurement equation for the zero - spacing interferometer ; the real part is proportional to the sum of the powers incident from the two sides of the beam splitter where as the imaginary part is proportional to the difference . for uniform sky , the imaginary component will vanish .",
    "the pair of antennas for the zero - spacing interferometer will have to be directive and with substantial fraction of their beam solid angle on the screen .",
    "nevertheless , because the antenna patterns will also have sidelobes directly on the sky , there will be direct rays from the sky to the antennas and that will yield unwanted responses . in the planned experimental setup",
    ", the screen is oriented north - south and so as the sky drifts east to west every part of the sky results in a response from both east and west sides of the screen as the piece of sky transits the meridian .",
    "therefore , when the response is averaged over 24  h in local sidereal time , the spectral structure in the interferometer response that is due to direct rays will average over time to give a constant signal across the observed spectrum .",
    "what will survive is the spectral structure due to spectral signals in the cosmic radio background , which is what the zero - spacing interferometer is designed to measure . in the average response , this will be the real part of equation  [ equal_split ] .",
    "for a beam splitter that has no charge or time varying magnetic field and hence no curl or divergence sources of the electric field , the electric field will be continuous across the surface .",
    "this implies that @xmath12 the real and imaginary parts of this equation lead separately to the relationships : @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for a lossless electromagnetic beam splitter , conservation of power",
    "requires that @xmath15 .",
    "these lead to the condition that @xmath16 , which implies that for such a lossless beam splitter the measurement @xmath17 has zero response to a uniform sky background .",
    "thus , beam splitters that are capacitive or inductive and hence lossless would have net phase difference of @xmath18 between reflected and transmitted components and for such beam splitters the net response of the zero - spacing interferometer would be zero for uniform sky ( see equation  [ equal_split ] ) .",
    "we next consider the case of beam splitters that are composed of multiple parallel sheets , which may be individually capacitive or inductive , but whose spacings are adjusted to tune the net phase .",
    "such a compound beam splitter may be described by it its net properties as a four - port network of the form shown in fig .",

    "even if composite , will manifest a phase difference of @xmath18 between the transmitted and reflected components as is the case for a partially silvered mirror .",
    "the lack of response to uniform sky is a consequence of this property .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that if the zero - spacing interferometer should respond to uniform sky , the beam splitter has to be lossy and not have a @xmath18 phase shift between transmission and reflection coefficients .",
    "the conductance @xmath33 between a pair of opposite faces of a uniform rectangular slab of conducting material is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the surface area of each of the two faces , @xmath36 is the spacing between the faces and @xmath37 is the bulk conductivity of the material of the slab .",
    "sheet conductance ( @xmath38 ) of a conducting sheet is defined as the conductance between a pair of opposite edges of a square piece of this sheet . if the sheet has thickness @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 the unit for sheet conductance is siemen - square .",
    "the space beam splitter is taken to be a sheet of conductance @xmath42 ( siemen - square ) , where @xmath37 is the material conductivity and @xmath43 is the sheet thickness . when an electromagnetic wave traveling in one medium is incident on a second medium with a different intrinsic impedance , in general the wave will be partially reflected and partially transmitted .",
    "since the second medium considered here has a definite value of conductance , a part of the incident energy will also be absorbed at the sheet .",

    "snell s law applies here and the angle of reflection is equal to that of incidence .",
    "the angle of transmission is the same as angle of incidence because the wave travels into the same medium ( air , whose intrinsic impedance @xmath1 is 377  @xmath50 ) following propagation through the sheet . for oblique incidence",
    "it is necessary to consider a pair of polarizations for the incident electric field : ( 1 ) an e - plane incidence , where the incident e - field is in the plane of incidence and ( 2 ) an h - plane incidence , where the incident e - field is perpendicular to the plane of incidence .",

    "the emissivity will depend on the physical temperature of the resistive sheet and its opacity . the fractional coherence between the emission on the opposite sides will depend on the opacity : an opaque screen will have maximum emissivity and zero mutual coherence and as the opacity reduces the emissivity reduces and the fractional mutual coherence increases .",

    "for oblique incidence , measurements of @xmath134 were made separately for @xmath53-plane incidence , in which the transmitter and receiver antennas were mounted parallel to ground , and for @xmath51-plane incidence , in which the antennas were mounted in the plane of incidence and inclined at @xmath137 to the vertical . at each frequency",
    ", the distance between the antennas and resistor grid was adjusted so that the fresnel number @xmath138 was in the range 0.30.5 , where @xmath139 is the dimension of the resonant antenna , @xmath140 is the wavelength of the measurement and @xmath141 is the distance between the antennas and the resistor grid .",

    "measurements of reflection coefficients were also carried out for three cases : normal incidence , h plane incidence at an angle of @xmath137 and e plane incidence at an angle of @xmath137 . for normal incidence , a single antenna was used as a trans - receiver .",
    "the trans - receiver antenna was placed on one side of the resistor grid and connected to the output terminal of the network analyzer . in this particular case ,",
    "the @xmath125 scattering parameter served as a measurement of the reflected power .",
    "the linearly polarized antenna was mounted perpendicular to the ground at a fixed height of 2.0  m and at each measurement frequency the distance between the antenna and resistor grid was adjusted to be four times the fresnel number .",
    "oblique incidence measurements were made separately using a pair of antennas and as the @xmath126 scattering matrix element .",
    "for these reflection coefficient measurements both antennas were placed on the same side of the resistor grid . as in the transmission case , for h - plane measurements",
    "the linearly polarized antennas were mounted horizontally and their relative heights above ground were adjusted so that the nominal ray path between the antennas reflected off the center of the screen with an incidence angle of @xmath137 .",
    "the pair of antennas were placed in the plane of incidence for e - plane measurements , with one tilted to @xmath137 and the other to @xmath142 with respect to the vertical .",
    "calibration of the reflection measurements to derive the reflection coefficients of the resistor grid required additional calibration measurements .",
    "these secondary measurements of the scattering matrix element were done separately without the grid and , additionally , with a reflector plate ( aluminum sheet ) replacing the resistor grid .",
    "the amplitude and phase recorded in this second calibration measurement are denoted by @xmath143 and @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is either 11 or 21 depending on whether @xmath125 or @xmath126 was measured .",
    "the complex @xmath146 and @xmath128 calibration measurements that were made without the resistor grid in place were subtracted from the corresponding measurements made with the resistor grid and with aluminum reflector in place .",
    "this subtraction was aimed at cancellation of space propagation terms and invariant extraneous reflections from the environment .",
    "the reflection coefficient of the resistor grid is estimated as follows : @xmath147    fig .",
    "[ graph_6 ] shows a plot of reflection coefficient @xmath148 versus frequency for normal incidence",
    ". plots of @xmath148 versus frequency for oblique incidence at @xmath137 are shown in figs .",
    "[ graph_7 ] and [ graph_8 ] for cases where the incident electric fields are , respectively , in the @xmath53 and @xmath51 planes .",
    "as expected , the modeling of the reflection and transmission that takes into account the finite size of the resistor grid provides a better match to the measurements .",
    "these refined computations of the expected coefficients are based on physical optics modeling of the diffraction along the edges .",
    "the numerical computation sampled the electric field over a finely spaced square array of points on the plane of the resistor grid . the sampling extended over an area up to ten times larger in extent along the upper and two adjacent sides of the resistor grid .",
    "the bottom fourth side was omitted since ground blocks paths in that dimension .",
    "the first step of the computation was to propagate all rays from the phase center of the transmitter antenna to each and every point on the chosen grid plane assuming inverse square law propagation of power in free space .",
    "the computed electric field at each sampling point on the plane was computationally reflected or transmitted knowing the angle of arrival of each ray . reflection and transmission coefficients of the resistor grid were adopted over the @xmath135  m@xmath136 area of the resistor grid . beyond that , transmission coefficient of unity and reflection coefficient of zero was assumed . in the case of e - plane incidence in which the electric field is oriented in the plane of incidence , a correction factor of ( cos@xmath149 ) was applied to account for the tilt between the measuring antennas and the plane of the resistor grid .",
    "the array of emergent fields were propagated with space loss to the receiving antenna and the components along the polarization direction of the receiving antenna were added vectorially to obtain the net response .    in the case of transmission",
    ", the numerical computation of the net received field is repeated for the case where there is no resistor grid between the antennas .",
    "the pair of computations made for the cases with and without the resistor grid are used as in equation  [ tau_measurement ] to derive the expectation for @xmath74 .",
    "the computation of the net received field for reflection is repeated for the case where the resistor grid is replaced with a perfect reflector with @xmath150 and the pair of computations used as in equation  [ gamma_measurement ] to derive the expectation for reflection coefficient .    the results of this physical optics based expectation for the measurements of transmission and reflection coefficients are also shown in figs .  [ graph_3][graph_8 ] along with expectations corresponding to an infinite size for the resistor wire grid .",
    "if an infinite screen with ( @xmath151  square@xmath102 sheet resistance were used for power splitting , then the reflection and transmission coefficients would be close to 0.5 .",
    "the physical optics modeling demonstrates good agreement between measurements and modeling for the finite size resistor grid based space beam splitter : the discordance between modeling and measurements has a standard deviation of about 5% .",
    "a resistor wire grid is a good approximation to a resistive sheet and may be made arbitrarily close in performance to a sheet by reducing the grid size . from the point of view of minimizing wind loading on a vertically mounted beam splitter of the dimensions required for meter wavelength operation , a resistor wire grid may be a practically preferred alternative to a resistive sheet .",
    "however , a resistive sheet would have wider bandwidth of operation compared to a grid and the sheet would be frequency independent over the entire domain wherein the sheet resistance remains close to the nominal value . however , in both cases , the finite size of realizations of space beam splitters would manifest edge diffraction effects in the response , which would be frequency dependent .    as a comparison and reference , we have also computed the transmission and reflection coefficients for a @xmath135  m@xmath136 beam splitter that is assumed to be a resistive sheet of ( @xmath151  square@xmath102 sheet resistance .",
    "these are shown in figs .",
    "[ graph_9][graph_14 ] in which the response of such a finite size resistive sheet is compared with a resistor grid of the same total size ; it may be noted that the resistor grid is assumed to have resistors of value @xmath121 that is somewhat different from @xmath119 .",
    "the figures show that the electromagnetic performances of the wire grid and continuous sheet beam splitters are very similar in the frequency range explored here , in which the grid size is a small fraction of the wavelength .",
    "events in the early history of the universe are believed to have left imprints in the spectrum of the cosmic radio background .",
    "their detection requires precision receivers .",
    "a major problem in their detection is confusion from internal noise of spectral radiometers , which includes self - generated noise in the low - noise amplifiers as well as noise added by ohmic losses in the antenna and passive interconnects .",
    "radiometers operating as interferometers avoid this problem since ohmic losses and amplifier noise are uncorrelated between elements in different arms .",
    "however , detection of uniform sky brightness with an interferometer requires a space beam splitter operating at radio wavelengths .",
    "towards building such a zero - spacing interferometer for absolute measurements of spectral signatures in the radio sky , we have developed an electromagnetic space beam splitter as a semi - transparent resistive sheet .",
    "a two - element interferometer with antennas on either side of a vertical resistive sheet forms a zero - spacing interferometer .",
    "the antenna beam solid angle is expected to be directed at the vertical resistive sheet so as to dominantly respond to sky brightness that is either reflected or transmitted from the sheet on the two sides . with the use of the beam splitter ,",
    "half the incident sky power is absorbed in the resistive sheet , a quarter is transmitted and a quarter reflected .",
    "resistive sheets are frequency independent and hence their reflection ( @xmath73 ) and transmission ( @xmath74 ) properties are independent of frequency , thus providing smooth transfer function for the sky spectrum without altering the cosmological signatures embedded therein",
    ".    the electromagnetic beam splitter has been realized as a square grid of resistive wire or a square grid of resistors .",
    "such a realization would , admittedly , have frequency independent characteristics only at wavelengths substantially longer than the grid size and considerably smaller than the physical size of the sheet .",
    "reflection and transmission coefficients were measured , both for normal as well as oblique incidences , as well as for cases where the incident electric field is in the plane of incidence and perpendicular to this plane .",
    "the measurements were done as @xmath125 and @xmath126 scattering matrix parameters using a network analyzer and a pair of linearly polarized antennas resonant at the measurement frequency .",
    "the measurements were calibrated using corresponding measurements made without the resistor grid and separately by placing a conductive aluminum sheet in its place .",
    "the measurements of reflection and transmission coefficients agree with expectations .",
    "the development continues with designing antennas appropriate for the zero - spacing interferometer configuration , which would then lead to a system design .",
