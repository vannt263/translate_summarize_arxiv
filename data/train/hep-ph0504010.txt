    "our idea is that wimps with velocities smaller than the cdms threshold but larger that the dama threshold could explain the data . our idea is based on the following observation .    the minimum wimp speed required to produce a nuclear recoil energy @xmath2 is given by elementary kinematics as @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the reduced wimp - nucleus mass , @xmath5 is the wimp mass and @xmath6 is the nucleus mass .",
    "the nuclear energy threshold @xmath7 observable with a particular nucleus corresponds through eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) to a minimum observable wimp speed , the speed threshold @xmath8 .",
    "speed thresholds for several direct detection experiments listed in table  1 are plotted in fig .  1 as a function of the wimp mass in the range @xmath9 gev .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) , it is easy to see that the speed threshold of na in dama is smaller than that of ge in cdms - suf for @xmath10 .    to understand the dependence of the speed threshold on nuclear mass , consider the simple case @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath12 is independent of the nucleus mass @xmath6 , and @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath13 . using the nuclear masses of na and ge , @xmath14  gev and @xmath15  gev , and the energy thresholds in table  1 , the product @xmath16 is smaller for na in dama than for ge in cdms - suf ( notice that dama used `` electron - equivalent '' energies , which we indicate with kevee units ; these need to be converted into nucleus recoil energies using the so - called quenching factors listed in the caption of table  1 ) . for @xmath17 , the ge @xmath8 in cdms - suf",
    "is 2.44 times the na @xmath8 in dama .    for @xmath5",
    "not necessarily much smaller than @xmath6 , we can refer to fig .  1 . the speed threshold of ge in cdms - suf , of si and ge in cdms - ii , of ge in edelweiss , as well as those of other experiments using heavier nuclei , are larger than the speed threshold of na in dama in the wimp mass range shown .",
    "three light nuclei , namely si in cdms and al and o in cresst , have speed thresholds lower than na in dama , and can be used to test and constrain our idea .     of several experiments and target nuclei .",
    "the dama na threshold is lower than the cdms - suf ge threshold for @xmath18 gev.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a small component of si is present in cdms .",
    "si is lighter than ge , although heavier than na , @xmath19  gev .",
    "given the nuclear energy recoil thresholds in table  1 , the speed threshold of si in cdms - suf is smaller than that of na in dama for all wimp mass values .",
    "however , considering the cdms - suf efficiency close to 5  kev energies is about 8% , the effective exposure of the cdms - suf si detector near threshold is about 0.5  kg - day , which may be too small to have detected the signal which dama might have seen in its na detector . in any event , cdms has not yet used its si component to set limits on dark matter , but only to help in background rejection .",
    "light nuclei are used by cresst , in particular o ( @xmath20  gev ) .",
    "cresst - i  @xcite used sapphire ( al@xmath21o@xmath22 ) , which besides o contains al , similar in mass to si .",
    "cresst - i has set limits on dark matter with a very low nuclear recoil threshold of 0.6  kev , but with a small exposure of only 1.5  kg - day .",
    "the speed threshold for o in cresst - i is so low that cresst - i is sensitive to the bulk of the halo dark matter particles we are proposing .",
    "cresst - ii uses calcium tungstate ( cawo@xmath23 ) , which also contains the light o nucleus , but background discrimination sets a relatively high threshold of @xmath24 kev .",
    "cresst - ii has run a prototype without neutron shield and set the limits quoted in table  1 @xcite .",
    "the completed cresst - ii will test our idea .    in summary , for light enough wimps it could be possible to have dark matter wimps with a speed above threshold for na in dama , and below threshold for ge in cdms and edelweiss .",
    "that is , we could have a dark matter signal visible for dama but not observable in cdms and edelweiss and compatible with all experimental data .",
    "our procedure is the following . given a dark halo model , including the wimp velocity distribution , we find the viable region by making sure that we produce the correct amplitude for the dama modulation in the viable region and that all of the current experimental constraints are satisfied .",

    "this gives rise to a modulation in the expected counting rate with a period of a year .",
    "for a conventional halo , the counting rate varies approximately sinusoidally  @xcite , while for other halo models , in particular for models with streams , the time dependence is in general not sinusoidal  @xcite .",
    "we define the amplitude of the annual modulation as half of the difference between maximum and minimum counting rates .",

    "<S> our idea is based on attributing the dama signal to scattering off na , instead of i , and can be tested in the immediate future by detectors using light nuclei , such as cdms - ii ( using si ) and cresst - ii ( using o ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the nature of dark matter is one of the fundamental problems of physics and cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> popular candidates for dark matter are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) . </S>",

    "<S> here we show that it is possible to have a dark matter signal above the wimp speed threshold for dama and below the wimp speed threshold for cdms and edelweiss , so that the positive and negative detection results can be compatible . </S>",
    "<S> we find : ( 1 ) that with the standard dark halo model there is a solution for wimp masses about 6 - 9 gev and wimp - proton scattering cross section of about 1 femtobarn ( @xmath0  @xmath1 ) , and ( 2 ) that this region of solutions can be enlarged if a dark matter stream is suitably added to the standard dark halo . </S>",

    "<S> we proceed in a purely phenomenological way in choosing the wimp mass and cross section , although we concentrate on spin - independent cross sections only . </S>",
    "<S> we do not attempt to provide an elementary particle model to support the values of masses and cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> as justification of our approach , let us recall that there is no proven particle theory of dark matter . </S>",

    "<S> the usual signature searched for in accelerators , for example at lep , tevatron or lhc , is the emission of a charged particle related to the neutral particle in question . </S>",
