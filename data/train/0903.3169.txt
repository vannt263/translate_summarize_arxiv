    "gravitational collapse is believed to be the underlying mechanism for the most energetic events observed in the universe : grbs and supernovae .",
    "while it is commonly accepted that the remnant of such events is a black hole or a neutron star , the details of the process are uncertain . in relation to grbs , we investigate here the collapse of a fast rotating magnetized object , which can be understood in terms of the ` spinar paradigm ' .",
    "we define spinar as a critically - fast rotating magnetized relativistic object , whose quasi - equilibrium is maintained by the balance of centrifugal and gravitational forces .",
    "the evolution of a spinar is determined by its magnetic field .",
    "a benefit of the spinar model is that it describes transparently and in a simple way the main features of a real collapse .",
    "the properties of rotating magnetized objects were first investigated to understand the mechanisms of active galactic nuclei by , e.g. , @xcite , of pulsars by @xcite , and of supernova explosions by @xcite .",
    "a rotation - supported ` cold ' configuration with magnetic field received the name ` spinar '  ( see early reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "stellar mass spinars were suggested by  @xcite . in the works by @xcite and @xcite a burst of electromagnetic radiation produced during the collapse of a spinar was studied , and a spinar mechanism for grbs was first suggested .    as @xcite point out , there should be energy release in a process of spinar formation as well .",
    "this approach enables one to consider a two - stage scenario of a collapse . at the first stage , a spinar forms from a collapsing rotating body when centrifugal forces halt contraction .",
    "the effective dimensionless kerr parameter of the spinar is greater than unity . at the second stage ,",
    "the angular momentum is carried away , and the spinar evolves to a limiting kerr black hole or a neutron star , depending on its mass .",
    "@xcite develop a 1d model of the magneto - rotational collapse of a spinar , which includes all principle relativistic effects on the dynamics and the magnetic field , along with the pressure of nuclear matter and neutrino cooling .",
    "a variety of burst patterns is obtained , generally a combination of two peaks .",
    "it is shown that the spinar paradigm agrees with the basic observed grb properties .",
    "potential progenitors of spinars are rotating wr stars without h and he envelops , which are already considered as possible progenitors of grbs  ( for a review , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the spinar mechanism requires the presence of a high angular momentum in the wr core at the start of the collapse .",
    "a direct collapse to a black hole is impossible if the rotating core has an effective dimensionless kerr parameter greater than unity : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the moment of inertia of the core , @xmath3 is the angular velocity , @xmath4 is the core mass .",
    "equation   corresponds to the following condition on the specific angular momentum : @xmath5 fast rotation can be a result of the evolution of a rotating single massive star or a star in a close binary system ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "different scenarios for the collapse of a wr core are possible depending on the unknown properties of the collapsing core , among them the quantity and distribution of the angular momentum within the core .",
    "these scenarios have so far included : a highly magnetized rotating neutron star , a black hole surrounded by an accretion disc ( the ` collapsar ' model ) , a hypermassive rotating neutron star with an accretion disc  ( see references in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this regard ,",
    "the spinar mechanism is a natural complement to the range of potential grb producers .",
    "it is important to note that in distinction from the collapsar model of  @xcite , in the spinar paradigm a grb begins with a spinar formation and continues with its collapse to a limiting black hole . in the collapsar model",
    ", we first have the formation of a black hole , and after that a grb develops , powered from an accreting disc - like envelope and by the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "it is essential for the spinar that the central part of a core with mass @xmath6 has large angular momentum ( effective kerr parameter @xmath7 ) .",
    "in contrast , the collapsar model requires that there is less angular momentum in the centre and an excess at the periphery .",
    "there are calculations of the structure of wr cores supporting a hypothesis that may be there is too much angular momentum in the centre .",
    "for example , the results of @xcite indicate that the inner part of a wr core with mass @xmath8 is characterized by the effective dimensionless kerr parameter not less ( or not significantly less ) than an effective kerr parameter of the whole core .",
    "consequently , if a core has the effective kerr parameter considerably greater than unity and can not undergo a direct collapse to a black hole , then the inner part is equally prohibited to do so .",
    "the results of such models , usually intended for single stars , are generally uncertain as they are strongly dependent on the physics assumed .    in the present work we consider only massive stars collapsing in binary systems . in a binary system ,",
    "tidal interaction and synchronization lead to the fast rotation of a massive pre - collapse core  @xcite .",
    "binary systems as grb sites were considered by , e.g. ,  @xcite .    in previous work",
    "@xcite , the dependence of qualitative features of grbs on the initial parameters of collapsing cores ( their angular momentum , magnetic flux , and mass ) have been studied by calculating numerous models on a uniform grid of parameter values .",
    "it is clear , however , that the initial parameters are not distributed uniformly , and their values are defined by the course of previous evolution .    to derive the initial distribution on the effective ker parameter ,",
    "we use a population synthesis of binary stars carried out by the scenario machine  @xcite .",
    "we perform population synthesis for different binary evolution parameters and analyse the resulting set of grbs , which can be classified into different kinds of events .",
    "below we focus particularly on the precursor phenomenon  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , regarding it as a primary energy release accompanying a spinar formation .",
    "the ` lead time ' of a precursor , namely , the separation time from the main pulse , is an important and robust parameter that we calculate .",
    "as we show , there should be grbs with precursor occuring hunderds and thousands of seconds in advance .",
    "we also investigate the dependences between energy and temporal characteristics of two grb pulses .    in the next section",
    "we give a brief account of the relevant aspects of the population synthesis of binary stars . in sect .",

    ", we take typical values of the parameters , also used in @xcite .    to estimate the effective kerr parameter at the start of collapse , we need a relation between the radius and the mass of a rotationally - synchronized core at the evolutionary stage , after which , and until the collapse",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ table : prec_wind_models ] we give the approximate ratios of the number of grbs with precursor to the number of all grbs for different binary evolution parameters .",

    "if we halve the efficiency @xmath50 of the precursor , the relative number of precursors becomes greater but not significantly ( @xmath51  per cent for population ` 1 ' , for example ) . to provide some glimpse of the significance of the numbers , we can say that , if we change the level for calculating peak duration and energy to @xmath52 and keep other parameters unchanged , then the number of grbs with precursor drop to 6 per cent for population ` 1 ' .",

    "summarizing , the spinar paradigm explains observed precursor separation times and predicts that there are very early precursors with rest - frame time separations more than 100 s , which is the maximum determined rest - frame separation so far  @xcite .",
    "our results show that the rate of grbs with precursor , which have separations longer by up to one order of magnitude than those observed so far , is about half the detected rate  ( compare the second and third columns of table  [ table : prec_wind_models ] ) .",
    "the number of modeled grbs with precursor with lead times in the range from @xmath56 s to @xmath57  s is comparable to the frequency of precursor events observed so far . at the same time",

    "[ fig : prec_distrib]c .",
    "one should keep in mind that a rest - frame time interval as , for example , @xmath56  s , is dilated to @xmath58  s in the observer s frame . at this point ,",
    "an important general conclusion can be made : grbs at high redshifts will show precursor events which should arrive @xmath59  s in advance of the main event .",
    "this prediction is very strong as it does not depend on a grb model .",
    "the relative frequencies of the grbs with precursor , obtained in the spinar paradigm , agree reasonably well with observational facts .",
    "@xcite find precursors in @xmath60  per cent of _ batse _ long and short grbs detected before may 1994 ; @xcite finds that precursors are present in @xmath61  per cent of bright , long grbs in the final _ batse _ catalog ; @xcite obtains that about @xmath62  per cent from 105 grbs with measured redshift , observed by _",
    "swift _ before march 2008 , have precursor activity .",
    "note that these researches use different criteria for precursor search and selection .",
    "all these data agree quite well with the modeled ratios within an accuracy of @xmath63 per cent  ( see table  [ table : prec_wind_models ] ) .",
    "note that there is no significant difference in the ratios between the different binary evolution scenarios ( for wind model w1 ) and different @xmath37 .",
    "apparently , the strong wind scenario experiences the most difficulty in describing the reported ratios ( population ` 6 ' ) .",
    "to speak of a more robust result , the spinar model provides a clear explanation of the diversity of observed time separtions between precursor and main peak , which , moreover , can be related to the main physical parameters of a collapsing object in a simple way ( equation  [ eq : teor_sep ] or  [ eq : teor_sep_s ] ) . to our knowledge , explaining both relatively short ( @xmath51  s ) and long ( @xmath64  s ) switch - off times presented difficulties for most of the grb engine models  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "accretion has so far been neglected by us , but could be easily incorporated in the equations , as pointed out by  @xcite ; this is a topic for a forthcoming paper . as a preliminary result , we found that accretion of up to @xmath65m@xmath66 during the overall grb time ( @xmath67  s ) does not change qualitatively any of the results presented .      among 15 grbs with precursor studied by  @xcite",
    "there is one ( grb  070306 ) with two precursors .",
    "the first precursor is @xmath68  s from the second precursor , which is ahead of the main pulse by @xmath69  s. each pulse is stronger than the previous one .",
    "this grb is not shown in the figures in the present paper .",
    "one way to explain such a phenomenon is an unstable regime of jet with a constantly operating central engine .",
    "a mechanism of a modulated relativistic wind , resulting in long time gaps in emission , was considered by  @xcite .",
    "other possibilities appear if we consider the basic elements of the spinar paradigm . as we argue in the introduction",
    ", the course of a collapse is affected by the initial distribution of the angular momentum in the rotating object . in this",
    "regard , spinar and collapsar models are ` opposite ' options . in reality",
    "there is most probably an assortment of mixed scenarios .",
    "one possibility , provided by a particular angular momentum distribution in a pre - collapse core , is that a black hole forms first ( primary pulse ) , then a spinar ( heavy accretion disc ) forms around it ( second pulse ) , followed by a fatal collapse ( hyper - accretion ) of a spinar into a black hole ( third pulse ) .",
    "another explanation for a three - stage collapse can be that an accretion disc aggregates at some stage of a spinar evolution .",
    "here we should mention the ` initial jet and fallback collapsar ' scenario  @xcite with its characteristic disc time of @xmath64  s. in its context , we can speculate why the majority of grbs with precursor ( or grbs with one or more quiescent periods , see  @xcite ) are not three - step events .",
    "the fallback scenario works for explosions that are not too weak or too strong according to @xcite .",
    "an explosion which is too weak leads to a direct collapse to a bh , or a spinar if it rotates fast enough .",
    "rotating progenitors possibly favor ` direct collapse to a spinar ' without a huge explosion ; this view is supported by general and computational  @xcite arguments that rotation weakens the bounce and hence the explosion .",
    "numerical studies yield further options for gravitational collapse : fragmentation of a rotating collapsing body , a multiple black hole system formation  ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and its eventual merger . such scenarios ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can provide a burst with several pulses , but are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "let us provide some relations for the energetics of the precursor jet .",
    "the precursor jet is apparently the first to break through a shell that probably surrounds the central object . @xcite",
    "arrive at a condition for a jet to penetrate the surrounding shell .",
    "the jet breaks through if the momentum imparted on a part of the shell is greater than the momentum corresponding to the escape velocity : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the efficiency of processing the energy of the collapse to the pushing jet , @xmath19 is the speed of the jet , which is approximately the speed of light , @xmath72 is the portion of the shell s surface subject to the jet . substituting universal constants ,",
    "one has : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is in solar masses .    now consider the relations for the observed jet : @xmath75 it is natural to assume that the energy of the jet punching the shell is not the same as that of the observed @xmath76-jet and to introduce a factor @xmath77 between them , which depends , among other things , on the spectral band observed . here",
    "@xmath78 is the solid angle corresponding to the observed jet s opening angle , @xmath79 is the rest - frame isotropic bolometric energy , which can be derived from the values observed in a spectral energy band .    from the above we derive the minimum value @xmath79 that corresponds to a jet still capable of going through the shell : @xmath80",
    "let us now illustrate this with some numbers .",
    "[ fig : prec_distrib]a possibly indicates that @xmath81  erg from the data of @xcite .",
    "comparing with equation  , one can obtain an implicit estimate of @xmath82 for the observational data mentioned as low as @xmath83  per cent , if @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    in sect .",
    "[ s : results ] , we introduced the parameter @xmath50 to match the modeled energy of the pulses with the rest - frame isotropical values @xmath79 .",
    "we estimated it as . using and ,",
    "@xmath50 can be expressed as follows : @xmath86 if the half - opening angle of a jet @xmath87  rad  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath88 then @xmath89 and we come at an estimate for the effieciency of processing the energy of the collapse to the jet in the shell : @xmath90 .",
    "currently , much effort is put into numerical computations of grbs and simulations of jets emerging from rotating magnetized configurations , to name just a few , by @xcite and others .",
    "we believe that the progress with the spinar mechanism for grbs demands a further development by means of a mhd simulation .    in the present work ,",
    "we calculate many models of two - stage spinar evolution provided that fast rotating stellar cores are produced in binary systems due to a tidal synchronization mechanism .",
    "the pre - collapse parameters of wr stars are calculated by the scenario machine dedicated to the population synthesis of binary systems  @xcite .",
    "we analyse the resulting set of grbs , which can be classified into different classes . for grbs with precursor ,",
    "separation times between the precursor and the main pulse are fully consistent with observational data .",
    "we find that precursor events with the rest - frame time separation from the main pulse @xmath45  s occur in about @xmath91 per cent of the modeled grb events , for the weak wind scenarios of binary evolution and independently of the poorly established value of @xmath37 .",
    "this rate , however , depends on the specifics of the jet generation and its reliability is limited by the framework of our simple model . taking this into account , we think the modeled rate agrees very well with the observed values .",
    "comparison of the time and energetic characteristics of the modeled bursts with the observational data for grbs with measured redshifts  @xcite is made and a good general agreement is found .",
    "we predict that very early precursors with a rest - frame time separation more than 100  s should exist , and the number of grbs with precursor with separations in the range from @xmath56 s to @xmath92  s is about half the number of those observed so far .",
    "super - early primary pulses , up to @xmath93  s , are also found in the model ; they , however , may be too weak to be detected or to develop as a jet .",
    "finally , whether or not the present model works in all cases , the observational evidence is that rest - frame separation times of @xmath94  s take place .",
    "high - redshift long grbs , up to @xmath95 , are expected to be detected by future experiments  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we confidently expect precursor events arriving up to @xmath961000  seconds in advance of the main grb episode .",
