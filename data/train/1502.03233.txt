    "recent advances in symplectic geometry and topology showed that while some closed contact @xmath0-manifolds have only finitely many stein fillings , others have infinitely many , up to diffeomorphism ( see @xcite for a recent survey ) . among the @xmath2-manifold topologists , it is common to call a stein filling of a contact @xmath0-manifold exotic compared to another filling , if these two fillings are homeomorphic but non - diffeomorphic .",
    "the first examples of a closed contact @xmath0-manifold admitting infinitely many exotic _ simply - connected _ stein fillings were discovered in @xcite .",
    "the stein fillings in that article , and many others which appeared in the literature since then , were given as lefschetz fibrations over the disk whose boundary is a fixed open book supporting the contact manifold in question .",
    "recently , akbulut and yasui @xcite constructed an infinite family of exotic simply - connected stein fillings of a fixed contact @xmath0-manifold , where the fillings ( with @xmath3 ) are described by explicit handlebody diagrams , rather than lefschetz fibrations . in this paper , we consider the infinite set of contact open books each of which has a fixed exotic stein filling in their family as its page and identity as its monodromy , and show that the resulting closed contact @xmath1-manifolds are all diffeomorphic but pairwise non - contactomorphic .",
    "moreover , we give two alternative arguments to distinguish the contact @xmath1-manifolds : one is based on the barden s classification @xcite of simply - connected closed @xmath1-manifolds , and the other is based on the diagrammatic language developed for contact @xmath1-manifolds in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the latter approach is that we can explicitly identify the contact @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "we briefly review the infinite family of exotic simply - connected stein fillings of a fixed contact @xmath0-manifold due to akbulut and yasui @xcite .",

    "cancel the upper @xmath9-/@xmath10-handle pair and the lower @xmath9-/@xmath10-handle pair to get a diagram consisting of only two @xmath10-handles and no @xmath9-handles for both @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "this already implies that @xmath11 , and allows one to easily compute the intersection forms of @xmath4 and @xmath7 , which turns out to be unimodular and indefinite , for all @xmath6 .",
    "such forms are classified , up to isomorphism , by their rank , signature and parity .",
    "the signature of all the forms are zero , the form of @xmath4 is even , and the form of @xmath7 is even if and only if @xmath6 is odd .",
    "thus , by boyer s generalization @xcite of freedman s celebrated theorem @xcite , one concludes that @xmath7 is homeomorphic to @xmath12 if and only if @xmath6 and @xmath13 have the same parity and @xmath7 is homeomorphic to @xmath4 if and only if @xmath6 is odd .",
