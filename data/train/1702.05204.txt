    "this result is particularly important because it links the rich one - variable theory to this two - variable setting .",

    "this information allows us to study the geometry of these numerical ranges and in particular , investigate the classical problem :    `` when is zero in the numerical range @xmath75 ? ''    an answer to the zero inclusion question often yields useful information .",
    "for example , the numerical range of a compact operator @xmath23 is closed if and only if @xmath109 , @xcite .",
    "bourdon and shapiro @xcite studied the zero inclusion question for composition operators showing , among other things , that the numerical range of a composition operator other than the identity always contains zero in the closure of the numerical range . more recently , higdon @xcite showed that if @xmath110 is a holomorphic self - map of @xmath38 with denjoy - wolff point on the unit circle that is not a linear fractional transformation , then zero is an interior point of the numerical range of the composition operator @xmath111 .    in our setting , we obtain several results related to the zero inclusion question for @xmath96 .",
    "first , in proposition  [ lem : general ] , we obtain two conditions guaranteeing that zero is in this numerical range ; these conditions involve the foci of the elliptical disks comprising @xmath96 .",
    "we then impose additional restrictions on the coefficients of the rational inner function . under these restrictions , in proposition  [ lem : positive_eigenvalues ] , we obtain necessarily and sufficient conditions for both zero to be in the interior and zero to be in the boundary of the numerical range .    in section [ sec : boundary ]",
    ", we further study the shape of the numerical range @xmath96 . due to the complexity of the computations , we only consider rational inner functions of the form @xmath112 , where @xmath113 for a polynomial @xmath114 with no zeros on @xmath41 , a zero on @xmath99 , and @xmath115 .",
    "we initially consider the question :    `` when is the numerical range @xmath75 circular ? ''    for more general operators , this question has a long and interesting history .",
    "for example , anderson showed that if an @xmath97 matrix @xmath116 has the property that @xmath117 is contained in @xmath118 and there are more than @xmath59 points with modulus @xmath37 in the numerical range , then @xmath119 and zero is an eigenvalue of @xmath120 of multiplicity at least @xmath121 .",
    "in @xcite , wu extends these results .",
    "we show that for our restricted class of rational inner functions , which seem to be the ones most likely to produce a circular numerical range , @xmath75 is never circular .",
    "we then interpret the union of circles comprising @xmath75 as a family of curves .",
    "using the theory of envelopes , we are able to obtain a precise description of the boundary of the numerical range . the exact parameterization is given in theorem [ thm : boundary ] .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more information and other references about this question .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge institut mittag - leffler , where this work was initiated .",
    "the authors would also like to thank elias wegert for sharing a simple method for computing the envelope of a family of curves .",
    "let @xmath42 be a rational inner function on @xmath41 with @xmath61 . as mentioned earlier , there is a basically unique polynomial @xmath57 with no zeros on @xmath41 such that @xmath87 , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 have no common factors .",
    "an application of bzout s theorem implies that @xmath124 have at most @xmath125 common zeros , including intersection multiplicity and moreover , they will have exactly @xmath125 common zeros if @xmath126 moreover , one can easily check that @xmath57 and @xmath64 have the same zeros on @xmath99 .",
