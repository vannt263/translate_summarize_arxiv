    "echelle spectrographs are the most common instrument for recording high - dispersion astronomical spectra .",
    "since many echelle diffraction orders can be cross - dispersed and thereby recorded simultaneously on rectangular - format media [ e.g.  modern charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) ] , more - or - less continuous wavelength coverage over much of the optical range can be achieved whilst maintaining high resolving power , where @xmath4 is the instrumental profile s full - width at half - maximum . ] . to fully exploit the velocity precision available in high - resolution spectra , precise wavelength calibration over much of the optical range is required .",
    "this is now usually done by comparison with exposures of a thorium - argon ( thar ) hollow - cathode emission - line lamp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "after @xcite first suggested that th transitions might act as reliable wavelength standards , many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) measured th laboratory wavelengths and confirmed their suitability for such purposes .",
    "there are several reasons the thar spectrum has proven an enduring standard for astronomical spectroscopy : ( i ) most optical thar transitions have measured laboratory wavelengths , most of which are resistant to pressure and stark shifts ; ( ii ) th has one stable isotope and terrestrial ar is almost entirely composed of @xmath5ar @xcite .",
    "also , both th and @xmath5ar have even nuclei .",
    "therefore , no unresolved isotopic or hyperfine structure in the thar lines is expected ; ( iii ) most thar lines are unresolved at most practical resolving powers , i.e.  @xmath6 ; ( iv ) the thar line - density is high , @xmath01 line per  , over most of the optical range ; ( v ) thar lamps are fairly cheap , are commercially available and have lifetimes of typically @xmath01yr .",
    "other calibration sources include iodine absorption cells ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but these degrade the object signal and can only be used over a comparatively short wavelength interval ( typically @xmath750006500 ) .",
    "another , potentially ultra - stable , absolute calibration system might be based on the new technology of laser frequency combs @xcite , a possibility now under development .    despite the distinct advantages , there are , however , several drawbacks to using thar spectra for wavelength calibration .",
    "firstly , different thar lines have widely different intensities , far beyond the typical dynamic range of modern ccds ( i.e.  a factor of @xmath750000 ) .",
    "secondly , the wavelength distribution of lines is highly non - uniform ; it turns out that _ most _ thar lines are blended with relatively strong nearby lines , even at @xmath6 .",
    "it is therefore important to carefully select which thar lines are to be used when calibrating echelle spectra .",
    "this task is complicated by the fact that a given line s intensity ( relative to other lines ) varies from lamp to lamp and even within the one lamp over time .",
    "thar lines arise from a variety of th and ar ionization states and so , as the lamp ages and/or the operating current and pressure are varied , the relative strengths of different lines can change .",
    "thus , ideally , detailed selection of thar lines for wavelength calibration is best carried out separately for each thar exposure .",
    "however , in practice , most spectrograph - specific data reduction pipelines carry out only simple and minimal line selection , thereby assuming that a detailed pre - selection of lines has already been carried out .",
    "that is , for most practical purposes , it suffices to have a thar line - list pre - selected for the spectrograph of interest .    in this paper",
    "we detail an algorithm to pre - select thar lines for any echelle spectrograph and we apply the algorithm to the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the european southern observatory s ( eso s ) very large telescope ( vlt ) on cerro paranal , chile .",
    "eso have already pre - selected thar lines to calibrate uves and the line - list is included with the eso pipeline for uves data reduction .",
    "their selection derives from the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) who constructed simulated thar emission spectra based on line tables in the literature .",
    "report ` effective ' wavelengths for selected thar lines given the expected degree of line blending based on the relative line intensities in the literature .",
    "the effective wavelengths therefore depend on resolution ; the eso list is based on the @xmath8 results of .",
    "however , the eso list is not identical to the list and seems to include @xmath9 lines which were rejected by because no effective wavelengths could be found .",
    "furthermore , all wavelengths are only given to 3 decimal places ( in units of  ) and , in many cases , the wavelengths were _ truncated _ , rather than rounded , from 4 decimal places .",
    "such treatment of the thar line - list can cause non - negligible systematic effects in several applications . in this paper",
    "we focus on the effects it has had on current constraints on cosmological variations in the fine - structure constant , @xmath10 , derived from vlt / uves quasar absorption spectra . if @xmath10 were different in the high - redshift absorption clouds , the relative wavelengths of different metal - line transitions would differ from those observed in laboratories on earth .",
    "this effect provides a precise observational probe of possible variations in @xmath11 over cosmological time- and distance - scales called the ` many - multiplet ' ( mm ) method @xcite .",
    "analyses of a large sample of quasar spectra from the keck high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) have so far provided the first evidence for variation in @xmath10 @xcite with the most recent results indicating a smaller @xmath10 in the absorption clouds at the fractional level of @xmath12 @xcite . clearly , such a potentially fundamental result must be refuted or confirmed with many different telescopes and spectrographs .",
    "some first attempts with vlt / uves have now been made ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , generally yielding no variation in @xmath10 . while detailed analyses of hires thar spectra have shown no signs of strong systematic errors @xcite , no similar general assessment has yet been made for the bulk of the uves constraints on @xmath13 .",
    "given the errors in the eso thar line - list , it is imperative to do so .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : synth ] the various thar transition tables in the literature are combined according to their different strengths and weaknesses .",
    "section [ sec : select ] details the line selection algorithm .",
    "section [ sec : final ] describes the final thar line - list for use in calibrating vlt / uves spectra and shows the distortions of the wavelength scale introduced by the errors in the eso line - list .",
    "section [ sec : alpha ] assesses the general implications these distortions have for current uves constraints on a varying fine - structure constant .",
    "before selecting which thar lines are to be used to calibrate uves , we first require a list of laboratory wavelengths for as many features as possible which appear in measured uves thar lamp spectra .",
    "most features , especially below @xmath14 , are either known to be due to th or are unidentified ( but probably due to th ) , while @xmath77per cent of the features are from ar and @xmath15per cent are from ` contaminant ' species such as nai , mgi , caii and fei .",
    "the th and ar lines , and even some of the contaminant lines , are catalogued in various atlases derived from painstaking ( but usually rather old ) laboratory work .",
    "these atlases provide our starting point .",
    "however , every thar lamp gives a somewhat different spectrum and there always appear additional lines which can not be found in any atlas , even as ` unidentified ' lines .",
    "these are probably due to additional contaminant ions and molecular species in the lamp .",
    "this means that our prior knowledge of the thar spectrum from any given lamp is , at best , incomplete , thereby necessitating the selection procedure detailed in the next section .",
    "there is no single thar atlas covering the whole wavelength range of uves , @xmath7303010540 .",
    "however , there is one atlas of th lines only which does cover this range , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) .",
    "the absolute velocity precision varies from @xmath715 to @xmath7120depending on the line intensity .",
    "identify a large number of thi , ii and iii lines in their spectrum but a large number of unidentified lines remain , most of which are probably due to th . furthermore , on comparison with real thar lamp spectra , one notices that there are still several thousand lines which can not be accounted for by ar or contaminant species .",
    "very recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) used a large library of thar spectra taken over one month with the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher ( harps ) spectrograph on the 3.6-m eso telescope to improve the measurement precision of many thar lines , at least over the harps wavelength range of @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "they identified in their spectra lines from the atlas which showed no strong wavelength variations with time and obtained line positions with a root - mean - square variation ( rms ) of typically @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "thus , while bootstrapping their overall wavelength scale to that of , they were able to correct the wavelengths of individual lines , especially weaker lines . moreover , they were able to measure the wavelengths of all other features in their thar spectra , again at the @xmath18@xmath19 precision level .",
    "they removed from their list lines which saturated their ccd , ( very few ) lines which appeared in the catalogue but which were not detected in the harps spectra and , most importantly , they removed lines which were either closely blended with other lines at the harps resolving power of @xmath20 or were observed to change position with time .",
    "the latter indicates either that the line experiences significant shifts with changing lamp pressure or current or that the line is actually a blend and that the relative intensities of the blended lines varies with changing lamp conditions . in this work",
    "we use all lines from the atlas excluding those which have relative wavelength errors amounting to @xmath21 ; a total of 8219 out of 8442 lines are used from .",
    "the catalogue ranges from @xmath16 to @xmath17 . in selecting lines for use in calibrating uves",
    ", we use the line list for th and contaminant lines outside this range . however , it is important to begin with a list which includes the known ar lines as well so that ( i ) the maximum number of known blends can be identified and removed and ( ii ) the maximum number of lines are available for calibrating uves .",
    "three ar line - lists exist with similar wavelength precision ",
    "* hereafter ) , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter )  each of which has different advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the atlas contains both ari and arii lines whereas contains arii lines only and contains ari lines only .",
    "fewer lines are listed by compared to and since the experiment was less sensitive to weak lines .",
    "the velocity precision achieved by for the ari lines is better than that of but the velocity precision of the arii lines is better than s . finally , there is a calibration difference such that the @xcite wavenumbers are larger than @xcite s by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite s calibration should be more reliable since it uses calibration lines in the same recorded spectra as the arii lines .",
    "therefore , we use the @xcite calibration scale in synthesising the ar line - lists",
    ".    the different lists of ari and arii lines are combined in the following ways .",
    "we do not consider the ariii lines from since there are very few of them and since their wavelengths have larger uncertainties ( w.  whaling , private communication ) .",
    "* ari : following the recommendation in we used wavenumbers ( scaled by @xmath23 ) when available , otherwise values were used . for lines",
    ", the intensity scale of was used as re - cast by onto a logarithmic scale . for lines ,",
    "the intensity scale was used .",
    "* arii : wavelengths were used here since claim that they are relatively insensitive to pressure - shifts and that their values are more precise than s . in the few cases where reports an arii line that does nt , the wavelength ( scaled by @xmath23 ) was used . for lines",
    "the intensity scale was used ( this is the same as the intensity scale ) . for values",
    ", the intensity scale of was used as re - cast by onto a logarithmic scale . note that uses the intensity scale of @xcite for arii lines above air wavelengths of @xmath24  and below @xmath25 .",
    "this subtlety is neglected in the considerations below .    after combining the ,",
    ", , and lists in the above way we obtain the list hereafter referred to as lpwn . note from the above that the intensity scales for each species ( e.g. thi , ari , arii ) are different and that the relative intensities of lines from different species depend on many factors such as lamp pressure and current and the relative partial pressures of th and ar gas used .",
    "one should not simply use the above line - list , lpwn , to calibrate uves spectra because of the potential for line - blending .",
    "the fourier transform spectra of , , and and the harps spectra of all have resolving powers @xmath26 whereas the uves resolving power is typically @xmath27@xmath28 and possibly as high as @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , a major part of the line selection that follows is the rejection of ` close ' blends .",
    "the concept of ` close ' clearly depends on the relative intensities of the blended lines and so it is necessary to put all lines in lpwn list onto the one intensity scale typical of uves thar spectra .",
    "furthermore , since there are always additional unknown lines in measured thar spectra , a given thar line can only be used for calibration if it is _ measured _ to be reliable in the uves thar spectrum . for these reasons",
    "we have constructed a uves thar spectrum for use in the line selection process .",
    "thar spectra taken as part of regular uves maintenance activities with a @xmath30 slit and no ccd rebinning were retrieved from the eso science archive .",
    "exposures from several different standard uves wavelength settings ( 346 , 437 , 580 , 600 , 760 and 860-nm ) were used to provide complete wavelength coverage , with the exception of three small echelle order gaps redwards of @xmath31(@xmath32@xmath33 , @xmath34@xmath35  and @xmath36@xmath37 ) .",
    "the uves pipeline was used to extract and wavelength calibrate the data .",
    "several modifications to the pipeline , which will be reported elsewhere , were made to improve object extraction and wavelength calibration .",
    "the data were re - dispersed to a log - linear wavelength scale using uves poplermim / uves_popler.html ] , code specifically written to re - disperse and combine uves data from multiple wavelength settings .",
    "overlapping regions of spectra were cut away so that only one raw exposure contributed to the final spectrum at any given wavelength .",
    "no effort was made to flux - calibrate the final spectrum and the blaze - function of the echelle grating was still evident in the combined spectrum . however , our results from the intensity re - scaling in the next section demonstrate that this is a minor consideration .",
    "the final spectrum has a resolving power of @xmath38 and the log - linear dispersion is set to @xmath39 .",
    "the above line - list , lpwn , is treated as the input catalogue to the following algorithm for selecting a final list for calibration of uves .",
    "we make three passes through the algorithm , refining at each pass the line list used to calibrate the uves thar spectrum and other parameters specified below .",
    "figures [ fig : alpha][fig : comp ] pertain to the final pass through the algorithm .",
    "1 .   wavelength calibrating the uves thar spectrum : the procedure in section [ ssec : uves_thar ] for constructing the uves thar spectrum requires an input line - list for the wavelength calibration stage . at the first",
    "pass we use the line - list provided by eso with the uves pipeline .",
    "at the second and third passes the output from the previous pass through the algorithm is used . note that the line - list used at the first pass is irrelevant ; only an approximate wavelength scale needs to be established initially and this is greatly refined by subsequent passes through the algorithm .",
    "2 .   gaussian fitting : each line in the input list lpwn is searched for in the uves thar spectrum and fitted with a gaussian .",
    "the fit includes the 13 pixels centred on the pixel with maximum intensity .",
    "a first - guess continuum level is defined by averaging the first and last 2 pixels in the window .",
    "a first - guess continuum slope is defined from the difference between these averages .",
    "a first - guess amplitude is defined as the maximum intensity minus the continuum level .",
    "a first - guess width is defined from the velocity difference between the first and last pixels which have intensities less than the continuum plus half the first - guess amplitude .",
    "the first - guess central velocity is calculated as the intensity - weighted velocity of the 3 central pixels .",
    "a 5-parameter gaussian fit is performed and the best - fit parameters are used in the subsequent steps of the line selection algorithm .",
    "the initial guesses and gaussian fitting procedure are identical to those we used in our modifications to the uves pipeline .",
    "3 .   intensity re - scaling : the different th and ar atlases combined above have different intensity scales .",
    "furthermore , one would not expect to find the same relative intensities for lines of different ionization stages ( e.g.  ari and arii ) in the laboratory and uves spectra since the thar lamps will have had different operating conditions ( e.g.  pressure , current etc . ) .",
    "we therefore aim to place all lines from the different ionic species ( i.e.  thi / ii / iii , ari / ii , contaminant and unidentified species ) from each different intensity scale ( i.e.  , , and / ) on a single intensity scale directly related to the uves thar spectrum .",
    "first , any pairs of lines within 13 km / s of each other are removed from the input line list lpwn . for each ` category ' of line  for example , thi from , thi from , arii from , arii from etc .",
    " the catalogued intensities are compared with those measured from the gaussian fits performed on the uves thar spectrum .",
    "the median ratio of measured and catalogued intensity , @xmath40 , is defined as the scale - factor .",
    "all lines from this category are then scaled to the uves intensity scale by multiplying their catalogued intensities by @xmath40 .",
    "two examples of this process are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "figure [ fig : inten ] shows all lines from all categories placed on the uves intensity scale",
    ". +   refers to the re - scaled listed intensities and @xmath41 is the amplitude of the line measured from the uves thar spectrum . ]",
    "blend removal : if , when gaussian - fitting a single line , another weaker blending line is present but ignored in the fit , then the centroid returned from the fit will be shifted towards the blending line .",
    "the magnitude of the shift will depend not only on the velocity separation between the two lines , @xmath42 , but also on the relative intensities of the two lines , @xmath43 .",
    "when the two lines are not resolved from each other , it is easy to estimate the velocity shift : the new centroid wavelength is approximately the intensity - weighted mean wavelength of the two blended lines , @xmath44 the velocity shift due to the blending line is therefore @xmath45 however , if the two lines are further apart and are partially resolved it is not clear how @xmath46 will depend on @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ fig : blend](right ) shows the results of a numerical experiment where two blended lines are varied in relative intensity and separation and fitted with a single gaussian with similar initial guesses as in step ( ii ) .",
    "a by - eye fit to the contours of constant velocity shift gives the following relationship : @xmath47 the first term on the right - hand - side is just the previous equation and applies when @xmath42 is small with respect to @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the speed of light and @xmath50 is the spectrograph s fwhm resolution ) .",
    "we therefore reject lines from the input line - list lpwn which have blending lines within @xmath51 with relative intensities greater than that predicted by equation ( [ eq : blend ] ) to produce shifts greater than a tolerance of @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",
    "this tolerance is similar to the overall wavelength calibration residuals achievable at a typical uves resolution of @xmath53 with the final thar list .",
    "removal of weak lines : if thar lines appear weak in the uves lamp spectrum then the uves pipeline s line - identification algorithm can fail or yield a false identification .",
    "the velocity precision available in very weak lines is also too small to be useful in calibrating the uves wavelength scale .",
    "we therefore reject any lines with measured intensities ( above the measured continuum ) less than 4 times the measured continuum level .",
    "fwhm selection : any additional unknown features in the uves thar spectrum can cause blending with the lines remaining after steps ( iv ) & ( v ) above . the next three steps aim to reject those lines which are effected in this way .",
    "the first of these steps is to remove lines whose widths are clearly inconsistent with the instrumental resolution , in this case @xmath38 or @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ fig : fwhm ] shows the distribution of @xmath4 for all lines which survive steps ( iv ) & ( v ) above . after visual inspection of the lines lying away from the main cluster around @xmath55 it was clear that lines wider than @xmath56  or narrower than @xmath73.5 should be removed .",
    "lines were too wide when they were blended with other unknown features or where saturation of the ccd occurred .",
    "lines were typically fitted as very narrow when they were very weak .",
    "+   of @xmath74.3 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate our selection criteria for suitable calibration lines .",
    "the structure seen in this band is due to slightly differing resolutions in the different exposures from different wavelength settings . ]",
    "high slope rejection : one of the improvements we made to the uves pipeline was the addition of a continuum slope parameter to the gaussian fitting of thar lines during wavelength calibration . if a line is close to a strong , previously unknown feature in the uves thar spectrum then a large slope ( relative to the line s intensity ) might be needed to fit the line properly .",
    "since these unknown features probably vary with lamp conditions , lines fitted with large continuum slopes are best avoided when calibrating the wavelength scale .",
    "figure [ fig : slope ] shows the distribution of the absolute velocity difference , @xmath57 , between two gaussian fits ",
    "one made including the slope parameter , the other made with the slope fixed to zero  with continuum slope normalized by the line intensity .",
    "visual inspection of lines with @xmath57 greater than @xmath58 showed that some of them have large asymmetries which are due to close blends with unknown features .",
    "therefore , all lines with @xmath59 are removed from the list at this stage . +   to reject lines which might be effected by additional unknown features in the uves thar spectrum . ]",
    "large residual rejection : as a final selection step we reject lines which are fitted at wavelengths at some variance to those expected from the input line list lpwn . since the thar line - list supplied with the uves pipeline is known to contain several inaccuracies ( see section [ sec : intro ] ) we do not apply this criterion in the first pass through the selection algorithm . in the second pass we reject lines which are fitted at positions more than @xmath60 away from the expected position . in the third pass we reduce this parameter to @xmath61 , less than 1/10th of a pixel .",

    "the complete table is available at http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath7mim/pub.html and in the online version of this paper .",

    "the line - list supplied with the uves pipeline contains 2387 lines over the wavelength range covered by uves .",
    "so , although a large number of lines are rejected in the selection algorithm , there are certainly enough remaining lines to provide a reliable calibration of the uves wavelength scale . figure [ fig : select](left ) shows the distribution of lines with wavelength in bins which approximate the size of extracted uves echelle orders .",
    "compared to the initial input list , the distribution of lines is quite uniform .",
    "this is mainly because of the rejection of close blends and demonstrates why the lpwn catalogue should not be used without first selecting unblended and otherwise reliable lines . of course",
    ", since lpwn contains so many lines , one can always achieve very low _ formal _ wavelength calibration residuals simply by defining a sufficiently small rejection threshold during the calibration .",
    "however , it is important to realise that with this approach many of the lines eventually used for calibration will actually be blends which will distort the wavelength solution .",

    "distortions of the wavelength scale of the magnitude and over the wavelength ranges just discussed are critically important to current uves constraints on cosmological variations in the fine - structure constant , @xmath10 , which employ the uves pipeline and eso line - list .",
    "the velocity shift , @xmath72 , of a transition due to a small relative variation in @xmath10 , @xmath73 , is determined by the @xmath74-coefficient for that transition : @xmath75\\,\\hspace{1em}\\rightarrow\\hspace{1em}\\frac{v}{c } \\approx -2\\frac{\\delta\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\frac{q}{\\omega_0}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the rest - frequencies in the laboratory and at redshift @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the laboratory value of @xmath10 and @xmath80 is the shifted value measured from an absorber at redshift @xmath78 .",
    "the mm method is the comparison of measured velocity shifts from several transitions ( with different @xmath74-coefficients ) to compute the best - fitting @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the variation with wavelength in the magnitude and sign of the velocity shift in fig .  [ fig : eso ] will lead directly to spurious measurements of @xmath13 depending on ( i ) which transitions are utilised to compute @xmath13 and ( ii ) the redshift of the absorption system .",
    "an example of this problem arises in the results of @xcite who studied 23 absorption systems and concentrated mainly on the mgii @xmath812796/2803 doublet and the five strong feii transitions redwards of 2340 .",
    "the single absorber which dominates their sample , with a quoted uncertainty on @xmath13 of just @xmath82 , lies at redshift @xmath83 .",
    "this places the three feii transitions used in their analysis at observed wavelengths between @xmath84 & @xmath85  and the mgii doublet appears at around @xmath86 .",
    "[ fig : eso ] implies that a spurious velocity shift of @xmath87 between the feii and mgii lines will be measured in this system .",
    "the three feii lines all have large , positive @xmath74-coefficients @xmath71400@xmath88 while the mg ii doublet transitions both have very small @xmath74-coefficients @xmath7150@xmath88 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : da ] ) therefore implies that the @xmath87 velocity shift corresponds to a spurious @xmath89 , four times larger than the 1-@xmath90 uncertainty quoted by @xcite .",
    "this example of converting the residuals in fig .",
    "[ fig : eso ] into predictions of the systematic error in @xmath13 are easily generalised to any absorption redshift once a set of @xmath91 transitions is specified . fig .",
    "[ fig : fsc ] shows two examples , one utilising the mgii doublet and the five redder feii transitions , the other using those five feii lines plus the feii@xmath921608 transition . at each step in redshift ,",
    "the value of @xmath93 is calculated as follows : for each transition @xmath94 , the 7 thar lines which fall closest to its redshifted wavelength are identified and their mean residual , @xmath95 , ( as defined in fig .  [",
    "fig : eso ] ) is calculated .",
    "the error in each @xmath95 is assumed to be the same and is set equal to the rms residual of all @xmath96 thar lines , divided by @xmath97 .",
    "a linear least - squares fit between the @xmath95 values and the corresponding @xmath74-coefficients [ equation ( [ eq : da ] ) ] ) formally has zero @xmath98-intercept , the fit between the @xmath95 and @xmath74 values must contain the @xmath98-intercept as a free parameter , to be determined simultaneously with @xmath93 .",
    "this amounts to determining the best - fitted redshift of the set of the thar lines , mimicking the situation in the quasar spectra where one must determine the best - fitting @xmath13 and redshift simultaneously . ]",
    "then yields the best - fitted value of @xmath99 and its uncertainty .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : thar ] shows the values of @xmath93 for each of the 23 absorbers in the @xcite analysis .",
    "as described above , some absorbers are particularly sensitive to miscalibrations due to their redshift and the particular transitions used to determine @xmath13 . however , for 18 of the 23 absorbers , @xmath100 is less than @xmath101 .",
    "it is nevertheless important to asses the impact this has on the overall weighted mean value of @xmath13 .",
    "the values of @xmath13 , corrected by their respective @xmath93 values , are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : thar ] .",
    "the errors bars are the quadrature addition of the original errors quoted by @xcite and the errors in @xmath99 shown in the lower panel .",
    "the weighted mean of the corrected values is @xmath102 ; a 2.5-@xmath90 ` detection ' of variation in @xmath10 compared to the null result of @xmath103 claimed by @xcite .",
    "note that the error bars on the @xmath13 values from @xcite plotted in fig .",
    "11 have been shown to be significant underestimates in @xcite .",
    "thus , once larger , more appropriate error bars are used , the relative importance of wavelength calibration errors on the corrected @xcite result diminishes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , figs .",
    "[ fig : fsc ] & [ fig : thar ] clearly demonstrate how the eso line - list and the wavelength calibration procedure of the original uves pipeline cause significant systematic effects in measurements of @xmath13 at the @xmath82 precision level .",
    "values of @xcite .",
    "the lower panel gives the systematic error @xmath93 for each absorber while the upper panel shows the original @xmath13 values ( red / grey squares ) corrected by their respective @xmath93 values ( solid circles ) . even though the weighted mean calibration error is just @xmath104 , the fact that some of the ( apparently ) most precise @xmath13 values have large corrections means that the corrected weighted mean @xmath13 shifts significantly to @xmath102 . ]    a similar analysis is presented by @xcite who cross - correlate two uves thar spectra , one calibrated using the eso line - list and the other calibrated using the line - list distributed by the national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) , to determine the distortions of the wavelength scale over the range @xmath105@xmath106 .",
    "they find very similar structures ( in their figure 7 ) to those seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eso ] , including the sharp spike around @xmath107 .",
    "@xcite then test the effect these distortions would have on a single mg / feii absorber at @xmath108 , using only the redder feii lines and the mgii doublet1608 line in this test despite the fact that their analysis of the real absorber relies most heavily on this single transition . ] . since these lines are all redshifted to wavelengths where the mean calibration residual is similar ( i.e.  between @xmath109 & @xmath110 )  falling just short of the spike around @xmath107   it is not surprising to find little - to - no effect on @xmath13 at this redshift .",
    "based on this single - redshift example , @xcite claim that current uves constraints on @xmath13 should be fairly immune to any problems introduced by the eso line - list and ( unmodified ) uves pipeline wavelength calibration procedures . as demonstrated in the specific examples above and in the more general cases illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : fsc ] & [ fig : thar ] , such a simplistic extrapolation to other redshifts significantly underestimates the systematic errors involved .    finally , note that in @xcite and @xcite we carried out a similar analysis on the keck / hires spectra which provided our previous constraints on @xmath13 .",
    "the wavelength calibration employed the noao thar line - list discussed above . in those works we found no such structures like those seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsc ] .",
    "thus , although the current uves constraints on @xmath13 have been adversely affected by the eso line - list , such a problem does not generally exist for hires constraints to any significant degree .",
    "we have implemented a simple iterative algorithm to select thar lines for use in calibrating echelle spectrographs .",
    "the algorithm combines the expected line properties ( e.g.  degree of blending ) , based on the input line - list , with properties of the thar spectrum observed on the spectrograph of interest ( e.g.  resolution , relative line intensities etc . ) . we emphasise that although this paper has focused on the application of this algorithm to vlt / uves spectra",
    ", the algorithm can be applied to any other spectrograph ; all that is required is a thar spectrum taken on that spectrograph and a reduction code which allows repeatable wavelength calibration with different thar line - lists .    using the most recent and reliable thar laboratory wavelengths , including that of @xcite , we have produced a new thar line - list which , we argue , should be used to calibrate uves spectra in preference to the list distributed by eso .",
    "the main advantages of the former over the latter are : ( i ) more homogeneous input line catalogues with mutually consistent wavelength scales ; ( ii ) more accurate and precise laboratory wavelengths ; ( iii ) only unblended lines appear in the final list ; and ( iv ) only lines which are _ observed _ to be useful in uves spectra are included .",
    "indeed , the wavelength calibration residuals achieved using the new uves line - list ( @xmath111 ) are more than a factor of 3 better than those achieved with the eso or @xcite list ( @xmath112 )  see fig .  [",
    "fig : wavres ] .",
    "an assumption one makes in using our new line - list to calibrate uves spectra is that the relative line intensities ( i.e.  lamp conditions like pressure , current etc . ) are similar to those in the sample uves thar spectra used in our selection algorithm .",
    "however , ideally , the selection algorithm should be included in the wavelength calibration procedure itself , thus producing the best selection of thar lines for each individual thar exposure being reduced .",
    "the new line - list has been used to probe distortions of the wavelength scale introduced into uves spectra which were originally wavelength calibrated with the eso line - list .",
    "the distortions include sharp , short - range corrugations with peak - to - peak amplitude up to @xmath775  and longer - range variations between @xmath70 and @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eso ] ) .",
    "these distortions have serious implications in the context of current uves estimates of possible variations in the fine - structure constant , especially those of @xcite  see figs .",
    "[ fig : fsc ] & [ fig : thar ] .",
    "for example , if one employs the common mg / feii combination of transitions to derive @xmath13 then the errors in the eso line - list cause a spurious value of @xmath113 for absorption redshifts @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "although @xcite claim an overall precision in @xmath13 of @xmath117 from 23 mg / feii absorbers ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a single absorber at @xmath83 strongly dominates their sample with an individual error on @xmath13 of @xmath82 .",
    "however , at this redshift , and considering which transitions are used to derive @xmath13 in this system , we find that a spurious systematic shift of @xmath118 has affected this system .",
    "once such wavelength calibration corrections are applied to the entire sample , the null result of @xmath103 claimed by @xcite becomes @xmath102  a 2.5-@xmath90 ` detection ' .",
    "the new thar line - list we present here should aid in avoiding such important yet elementary errors in future analyses of uves spectra .",
    "we thank r.  engleman and w.  whaling for detailed discussions about the th and ar line - lists , respectively , and for providing the lists in electronic form .",
