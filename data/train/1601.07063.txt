    "average human mortality rates increase exponentially with age , following gompertz s law @xcite .",
    "this exponential growth holds well for ages between 40 and 100 years , and possibly older @xcite .",
    "individual mortality is preceded by the dynamical process of _ aging _ , which can be viewed as the accumulation of organismal damage with time @xcite . because individuals can accumulate health problems at different times",
    ", the health status of populations of a given age is heterogeneous .",
    "individual `` frailty '' could account for at least some of the differences in mortality rates for individuals of the same age @xcite , where frailty results from the individual accumulation of damage during aging .",
    "one quantitative measure of frailty is the time - dependent  frailty index \" ( fi ) @xcite , quantitatively denoted @xmath0 .",
    "clinically , the frailty index is assessed by scoring a broad portfolio of possible age - related deficits as either @xmath1 ( healthy ) or @xmath2 ( damaged ) .",
    "then @xmath0 is the proportion that are damaged , and ranges from @xmath1 for perfectly healthy individuals to a theoretical maximum of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in elderly populations the frailty index is as predictive as chronological age for various health - outcomes  including mortality @xcite .",
    "many different portfolios of age - related deficits , of different sizes , have similar behavior @xcite .",
    "for example , an fi can be created from biomarkers and laboratory tests @xcite .",
    "an fi can also be calculated for mice , and shows similar behavior as for humans @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our understanding of frailty accumulation in individuals remains largely empirical @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the frailty index broadens significantly with age @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the stochasticity of frailty dynamics is significant @xcite .",
    "indeed , longitudinal studies show both increases and decreases of @xmath0 with increasing age of individuals @xcite , and there are also direct indications that at least some individual deficits are reversible @xcite .",
    "two additional observations focus our approach .",
    "first , the time - dependent average @xmath3 shows a significant upward curvature vs. age @xcite . while linear accumulation of deficits with age indicates independent damage processes for each deficit , and negative curvature can indicate saturation , upward curvature indicates an increasing rate of deficit accumulation with age @xcite .",
    "second , average mortality rates increase with increasing @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this increase underlies the additional clinical predictive value of the fi , as compared to age alone .",
    "early quantitative models of human mortality , such as that of strehler and mildvan @xcite , focused on obtaining the time - dependent mortality directly .",
    "more recently , to capture the upward curvature of @xmath3 , researchers have introduced explicit time - dependent damage or repair rates in the dynamics of individual health deficits @xcite . to relate deficits with mortality ,",
    "researchers have also included explicitly time - dependent dynamics for individual deficits @xcite .",
    "conceptually , individuals are comprised of interconnected , or networked , processes and components .",
    "networks underly both healthy function @xcite and human disease @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that a network approach would be appropriate in the study of human aging at various scales @xcite . indeed , earlier work proposed biochemical networks at the cellular level @xcite , and demonstrated networks of correlations between age - related deficits @xcite .",
    "recently , vural et al have presented a network model of animal mortality @xcite .",
    "often complex networks are assumed to be scale - free , where the number of connections ( edges ) @xmath4 from each node has a power law distribution @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "such scale - free networks are heterogeneous  with a few large hubs that have a large numbers of connections , and many more nodes that are not well connected .",
    "conversely , nodes in random networks are homogeneous  all have similar connectivity .",
    "there are indications that networks of human physiology @xcite , disease @xcite , longevity - related proteins @xcite , and age - related deficits @xcite are heterogeneous , and may be scale - free @xcite .    in order to better understand how deficit dynamics can lead to both the observed behavior of @xmath3 and the observed mortality , we have developed a stochastic model of interacting deficits .",
    "we represent an individual as an undirected network of connected deficit nodes , each of which has two stable states corresponding to healthy or damaged . in our model , damage and repair rates have no explicit time - dependence , but do depend on the state of connected nodes .    for scale - free and random network models , random removal of more than a threshold fraction of nodes leads to a failure of network connectivity @xcite . to determine animal mortality , the network model of vural _ et al .",
    "_ used a frailty threshold .",
    "however an explicit threshold on @xmath0 can not recover the continuously increasing mortality rates with increasing @xmath0 that are seen with clinical human data @xcite . to attempt to recover this behavior , we take mortality to occur when one ( or more ) of the most highly connected nodes is damaged , while frailty is represented by the average damage state of highly connected nodes that are not mortality nodes .    with our model",
    "we recover much of the existing frailty phenomenology , along with a gompertz - like increase of mortality with age .",
    "this addresses two basic questions .",
    "first , can the upward curvature of @xmath3 be captured _ implicitly _ by interactions between deficits , or must it imply an _",
    "explicit _ age - dependence in , e.g. , the damage or repair rates of individual deficits ?",
    "second , can the increase of mortality with respect to @xmath0 be captured implicitly by interacting deficits , or must it imply an explicit dynamical dependence of mortality on @xmath0 ? in both cases , we show that the behavior can arise naturally and implicitly from interacting deficits alone .",
    "for each individual , we consider network nodes @xmath6 to represent continuous valued physiological parameters @xmath7 , where increasing damage corresponds to increasing @xmath8 , that each follow stochastic over - damped dynamics following an effective potential : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is gaussian white noise , @xmath11 is the interaction parameter , and @xmath12 is the average damage of all nodes connected with the @xmath6th node ( i.e. a local frailty ) . for simplicity , we take @xmath13 to be an asymmetric double - well potential ( see fig .  [",
    "f : doublewell ] ) @xmath14 \\label{v}\\ ] ] with local minima at @xmath15 and @xmath2 , and an intervening barrier at @xmath16 .",
    "the interaction term in eqn .",
    "[ e : dynamics ] can also be represented by a tilted effective potential @xmath17 , which then shifts the local minima for each node and also shifts the intervening barrier @xmath18 .    under the effects of noisy dynamics , individual nodes will transition randomly between the two local minima corresponding to healthy states ( with @xmath19 ) and damaged states ( with @xmath20 ) , which we discretely label with deficit indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",

    "the interaction strength @xmath11 is kept small enough so that local minima are well defined even when @xmath30 .",
    "rates depend on the local frailty @xmath12 through eqn .",
    "[ e : dynamics ] .",
    "these transition rates , @xmath31 vs @xmath12 , are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : doublewell](c ) .",

    "[ e : kramerrate ] for each node @xmath6 using exact random sampling of transition times between healthy and damaged states @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "after each transition of any node , local frailties @xmath32 and transition rates are updated for all connected nodes .    rather than determining the kramer s rate parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 directly from eqns .",
    "[ e : dynamics ] and [ v ] , we tune them phenomenologically .",
    "@xmath33 is adjusted so that our model results agree with the most likely death age in human mortality statistics , which is 87.5 years @xcite .",

    "[ e : dynamics ] .",

    "@xmath55 is a diagnostic measure , and is not directly involved in either damage or repair of individual nodes or in mortality .",

    "the choice of the number of deficits @xmath51 included in the diagnostic frailty @xmath55 has no influence on the model dynamics .",

    "conversely , at a given @xmath0 the mortality rates are only relatively weakly dependent on age .",
    "much ( though not all ) of the weak age dependence within the quartiles results from variations of @xmath0 within the quartile . at younger ages ( @xmath59 years ) ,",

    "[ f : oldyoung ] ( a ) , we find this pattern with our model data . the distribution does not become left - skewed , even though we must have @xmath61 , since mortality typically removes individuals as they reach higher @xmath0 . on the right , in fig .",

    "the peak of the death - age distribution is rescaled to @xmath65 years in each case , and this leads to continued agreement of mortality rates at older ages . with this logical-``or '' with multiple mortality nodes ,",

    "we note that in our model there is no strict frailty maximum , and so multiple - node `` or '' may not be the underlying cause of the population frailty maximum . clearly the mortality condition is important , and is a sensitive control of qualitative model behavior .",

    "the frailty index @xmath0 is a quantitative measure of individual aging that is as informative as chronological age in predicting health outcomes , including mortality .",
    "the fi is defined as the fraction of damaged health - related deficits .",
    "given the increasing health burden on our burgeoning elderly population , it is important to better understand the observed quantitative dynamics of the frailty index . to do this",
    ", we have developed a stochastic model of damage and repair of interacting deficits .",
    "the stochasticity of @xmath0 is important , and we have qualitatively recovered the observed broadening of the distribution @xmath60 with age ( see fig .  [",
    "f : oldyoung ] ) .",
    "stochasticity can , in principle , arise from either stochastic damage or stochastic repair  or both .",
    "we have found that a significant amount of explicit deficit repair is consistent with observed age - dependent mortality and @xmath0 ( see appendix fig .  [ r ] ) .",
    "we have addressed our two key questions .",
    "first , can the observed upward curvature of @xmath0 vs age be obtained with time - independent interactions between deficits , or must explicitly time - dependent damage rates be invoked ? we have shown ( see fig .  [",
    "f : fidata ] ) that time - independent interactions ( @xmath66 ) alone are sufficient .",
    "second , can we recover the observed connection between @xmath0 and mortality without building @xmath0 directly into model mortality ?",
    "we have shown that this is indeed possible ( see fig .",
    "[ f : gompertzdata ] ) , since the ( highly connected ) deficits we have used for mortality have no overlap with the ( less connected ) deficits that we have used for our frailty measure @xmath55 .    due to deficit interactions ,",
    "our model repair rates are age dependent ( see fig .  [",
    "f : rates ] ) . while strong age - dependent slowing in human wound - healing rates",
    "have been reported since the seminal work of lecomte du noy @xcite , more recent emphasis has been on the proximal mechanisms controlling these rates  resulting in questions about how or whether to attribute slowed healing to age per se @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , age - related slowing of wound - healing is also reported in e.g. mice @xcite . echoing this ,",
    "bone fracture repair is impaired in older rats @xcite , though recent emphasis has been on detailed mechanisms behind this slowing @xcite . indeed , there are many age - related changes that could be considered even at the cellular level @xcite .",
    "our model provides a coarse - grained picture of interactions between deficits , and indicates that age - related slowing may be driven by frailty - related slowing .",
    "given the large variability of @xmath0 at a given age ( see fig .  [",
    "f : oldyoung ] ) , we conclude that @xmath0 is important to control for when assessing age - dependent repair rates .",
    "it is attractive to think that highly connected model deficits correspond to clinically - accessible high - level physiological states .",
    "indeed , we use our most connected node to indicate mortality and reserve the next - most connected nodes for @xmath55",
    ". however , there is no direct equivalence between model deficits and any specific physiological deficits .",
    "indeed , we may best think of our model deficits as combinations of physiological measures .",
    "similarly , we might think of conveniently accessible clinical deficits ( see e.g. @xcite ) as reflecting combinations of cellular , organ , and systems - level mechanisms ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if so , the effective connectivity of individual clinical deficits may be difficult to directly assess .    in the appendix",
    ", we have systematically varied each of our key model parameters to see how they affect mortality , @xmath0 and deficit transition rates .",
    "the default parameters used in our paper were found to give reasonable qualitative agreement with current data @xcite . we have illustrated how including more highly connected nodes in our mortality rules can improve @xmath0 evolution and distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ f : or ] )  albeit at the expense of further overestimating mortality rates at younger ages .",
    "this was done by triggering mortality if _ any _ of multiple mortality nodes are damaged . complementing this , in fig .  [ and ] we have explored triggering mortality only if _ all _ of multiple mortality nodes are damaged . in that case , we can get better agreement with mortality rates but worse agreement with @xmath0 behavior .",
    "the sensitivity of our model results to mortality rules is promising since it will allow us to better explore the connection between model deficits and mortality and so between clinical deficits and human mortality .    while we have found that both the average and the distribution of connectivities affect our model behavior when other parameters are kept fixed ( see fig .",
    "[ k ] and [ network ] ) , we caution that we have not exhaustively searched parameter space and so can not rule out alternative topologies @xcite .",
    "we have also not explored differences between directed ( see e.g. @xcite ) and non - directed network links . in this work",
    "we have only used non - directed links , and have predominately considered scale - free networks . in future work , we will use our model to develop new diagnostics that are more sensitive to network topologies and apply them to clinical data in order to better characterize effective interaction networks of clinical deficits .",
    "the emerging prospects of large quantities of laboratory or biomarker data @xcite , as well as tracked health data @xcite , usable for assessing frailty present the question of how to rationally incorporate new data when it is available to best contribute towards health assessment . in future work , we will use our model to learn how to construct a better @xmath0 that is more predictive of individual mortality .",
    "such a frailty measure may include aspects of individual frailty trajectories , but also an optimized compromise between number and quality of deficits . our computational model will allow us to start this development with high - quality model data , before we test our insights against current and emerging clinical data .",
