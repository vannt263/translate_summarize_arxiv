    "two is the critical dimension for anderson localization , namely , above 2 dimensions states are localized only above a critical strength of the disorder ( impurities ) whereas below 2 dimensions states are localized for any strength of the disorder@xcite .",
    "for this reason one can expect rich phase structures in two dimensions .",
    "it is well understood that a complete understanding of the quantum hall transition involves delocalization@xcite@xcite . in these localization problems ,",
    "understanding the quantum phase transition in the conductivity requires finding the right renormalization group fixed point at large distances .",
    "this usually occurs at strong coupling , which is why these problems are considered difficult .",
    "the conventional theoretical framework leads to sigma models on various spaces@xcite . for the quantum hall transition the sigma model",
    "was worked out by pruisken@xcite .",
    "these results are important , but the sigma models have generally been too difficult to solve .",
    "the most recent progress can be found in @xcite .",
    "critical theories in 2 dimensions are conformally invariant and this imposes strong constraints on the theory@xcite .",
    "early efforts to use conformal field theory methods in the study of disordered dirac fermions were made by bernard@xcite , mudry et .",
    "@xcite , and nersesyan et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "perturbed conformal field theory methods were also used for disordered statistical mechanical models@xcite @xcite ; generally these are more difficult problems since the non - random theories are interacting so that one has to use replicas .",
    "many of the important problems here also are driven to strong coupling under renormalization group ( rg ) flow .    in this work",
    "we describe a general approach to disordered dirac fermions at strong coupling which uses the all - orders functions proposed in @xcite .",
    "these models are not integrable , but one can nevertheless sum up all orders in perturbation theory for the function .",
    "in some insightful work , chalker and coddington proposed a simple network model which is now believed to be in the universality class of the integer quantum hall transition@xcite .",
    "this network model has been shown to be equivalent to a certain theory of random dirac fermions@xcite , and this is the model we analyze using our methods .",
    "this model also appeared in the work@xcite .",
    "a sigma model formulation was proposed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is a first attempt at understanding the implications of these all - orders @xmath4eta functions , and for this reason is in part conjectural .",
    "the functions generally do not have non - trivial zeros , but rather have poles .",
    "we point out that functions with poles are also known to occur in supersymmetric gauge theory@xcite . in the next section",
    "we propose a general scheme for the fixed points of marginal symmetry breaking ( anisotropic ) current - current perturbations for a current algebra @xmath5 in 2 dimensions based on these @xmath4eta functions and certain hypotheses .",
    "since there is no small parameter in these theories , one generally does not flow to a single fixed point , but rather to a fixed point manifold in the couplings . in the case of large couplings",
    "we show that this manifold generally corresponds to a sub - current - algebra @xmath6 of @xmath5 and argue that the infra - red fixed point is the current algebra coset @xmath7 .",
    "the function shows an interesting duality , namely @xmath8 flows to @xmath9 as the length scale varies from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . this is a new form of duality since the more well - known manifestations occur in scale - invariant theories . here",
    ", theories at a scale @xmath10 and coupling @xmath8 are equivalent to a theory at scale @xmath11 and coupling @xmath9 .    assuming our hypotheses for interpreting the @xmath4eta functions are correct , they turn out to predict a very tight phase structure ; in fact the resulting phase diagram is _ exact _ in the sense that the phase boundaries are precisely determined .",
    "we are unaware of any other models where the exact function allows one to determine so precisely the phase diagram . as an illustration we work out the simplest possible case of an anisotropic @xmath1 perturbation .",
    "this is the subject of kosterlitz - thouless transitions which have previously only been studied at weak coupling@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram is unexpectedly rich . at small coupling one phase exhibits",
    "the symmetry restoration recently studied at one loop@xcite@xcite , however it appears this symmetry does not persist at strong coupling .",
    "another phase has a line of fixed points corresponding to a free boson at a certain radius of compactification .",
    "if we extend the physical regime of couplings of the network model , the resulting disordered dirac theory again has a number of phases .",
    "though many of the features are similar to the anisotropic @xmath1 case , some features are novel and not completely understood .",
    "one phase ( @xmath12 ) has a line of fixed points related to @xmath13 studied in @xcite , and appears to be the only massless phase .",
    "it is in the same universality class as dense polymers and is also closely related to the disordered xy model@xcite .",
    "a sigma model version of this theory was proposed by zirnbauer in connection with the quantum hall transition@xcite , based on the work@xcite@xcite . in the physical regime of the network model",
    "we show that this phase is not easily realized since it corresponds to imaginary gauge potential .",
    "the other phases do not automatically fall into the category of @xmath14 , as explained below .",
    "an unexpected feature of our analysis is that initially positive couplings which are variances of real disordered potentials can flow to negative values , which in turn can be viewed as corresponding to imaginary potentials and thus non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "this could signify that our approach breaks down for reasons we do not yet comprehend .",
    "if this feature turns out to be sensible , it implies that the studies of delocalization transitions in non - hermitian quantum mechanics made by hatano and nelson@xcite may have some bearing on hermitian systems .",
    "the general class of quantum field theories we consider are current - current perturbations of a conformally invariant field theory .",
