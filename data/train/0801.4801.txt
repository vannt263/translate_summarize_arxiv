    "simultaneous imaging in different filter - bands is of interest in a variety of astrophysical areas .",
    "the primary aim is to measure the spectral energy distribution or its evolution in variable objects in order to uncover the underlying emission mechanism .",
    "examples are , among others , ( 1 ) monitoring of all kinds of variable stars ( flare stars , cataclysmic variables , x - ray binaries ) to determine the outburst mechanisms and differentiate between physical state changes and changes induced by geometrical variations , like eclipses ; ( 2 ) monitoring of agn to understand the physical origin of the observed variability ; ( 3 ) determining the inclination of x - ray heated binaries @xcite ( 4 ) mapping of galaxies to study the stellar population ; ( 5 ) multi - color light curves of supernovae @xcite ; ( 6 ) differentiate achromatic microlensing events @xcite from other variables with similar light curves ; ( 7 ) identifying objects with peculiar spectral energy distributions , e.g. photometric redshift surveys for high-@xmath2 active galactic nuclei , or identifying brown dwarfs ; ( 8) follow - up observations of transiting extrasolar planets @xcite ; or ( 9 ) mapping of reflectance of solar system bodies as a function of their rotation to map their surface chemical composition @xcite .    a new need for multi - band imaging arose with the observation of a large number of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows with the _ swift _ satellite @xcite . with its much more sensitive instruments it detects grbs over a very wide redshift range . since intermediate to high - resolution spectroscopy to measure the physical conditions of the burst environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is constrained to the first few hours after a grb explosion , a rapid determination of the redshift became important .",
    "this is best done with multi - band photometry ( until integral field units have grown to several arcmin field - of - views ) and deriving a photometric redshift based on the ly@xmath3 break @xcite .",
    "previous and current instruments with simultaneous imaging capability in different filter bands include andicam ( a novel double - imaging camera ; two channels , one for visual , the other for near - infrared @xcite , presently operated at a 1.3 m telescope ) , busca ( bonn university simultaneous camera ; four visual channels @xcite , presently operated at the 2.2 m telescope at calar alto ) , hipo ( high - speed imaging optical photometer for occultations ; two visual channels @xcite , to be operated on sofia , the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ) , mitsume ( multicolor imaging telescopes for survey and monstrous explosions ; three channels with fixed bands g , r@xmath4 and i@xmath4 @xcite , operated at a 50 cm telescope ) , trispec ( triple range imager and spectrograph ; three channels with one ccd and two near - ir detectors and wheels for filters , grisms and wollaston prisms @xcite ) , sqiid ( simultaneous quad infrared imaging device ; @xmath1 and narrow - band @xmath5 filters in front of individual 512x512 quadrants of an aladdin insb array , designed for the f/15 cassegrain foci of the kpno 2.1-m and 4-m telescopes @xcite ) , ultracam ( ultrafast , triple - beam ccd camera for high - speed astrophysics @xcite ; portable instrument which has been used , among others , at the very large telescopes at eso , or the william herschel telescope , canary islands ) .    here",
    "we describe the design ( @xmath62 ) and performance ( @xmath66 ) of a 7-channel imager , called grond ( * g*amma-*r*ay burst * o*ptical and * n*ear - infrared * d*etector ) , which was specifically designed for grb afterglow observations .",
    "we also mention some basics of the operation scheme ( @xmath63 ) , related software ( @xmath64 ) , and the changes to the telescope infrastructure which were implemented to use grond for rapid follow - up observations ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the primary goal of identifying grb afterglows and measuring their redshift led to the concept of a camera which allows observations in several filters throughout the optical and near - infrared region at the same time .",
    "the simultaneity is dictated by the fact that a typical grb afterglow fades by about 23 mag between 510 min after the grb , and by another 4 mag in the following 50 min ( e.g. kann  2008 ) . rapidly determining the photometric redshift of grbs at @xmath7 requires multi - band photometry in at least 34 bands . in order to have a stable lever arm to determine ( i ) the intrinsic power law slope of the continuum emission and ( ii ) the galactic foreground as well as grb host intrinsic extinction , near - infrared bands up to @xmath8 are essential . extending the wavelength coverage beyond @xmath8 by including , e.g. an @xmath5 channel ,",
    "was seriously considered during the design phase , but both the prospects of detecting a grb in the @xmath5 band as well as the substantial , additional technical constraints due to the required lower temperatures led us to drop this possibility .",
    "going as blue as possible is warranted by detecting the ly - break down to redshifts of @xmath93 ; however , also including a @xmath10 or @xmath11 band turned out to be difficult due to space and logistics constraints . leaving out one or two bands within our wavelength band would increase the error in the photo-@xmath2 determination by a factor of three at least ( for the redshift range covered by that band ) .",
    "thus , we decided to use four bands in the visual , plus the standard @xmath1 bands in the near - infrared ( nir ) .",
    "the field - of view ( fov ) of the camera should be large enough to cover the typical error boxes of gamma - ray bursts , but on the other hand have a pixel scale less than the mean seeing to allow accurate photometry . given the typical brightness of grb afterglows , a reasonably large telescope with permanent access is another important requirement . finally ,",
    "as grond would act as pathfinder to pre - select `` interesting '' grbs for more detailed follow - up observations , a nearby 810 m telescope was considered advantageous in the search for the final host telescope .    ]",
    "the final choice for the telescope was the mpi - owned 2.2 m telescope , operated by eso on la silla ( chile ) ; see @xmath6[tel ] .",
    "this telescope is a f/8.005 ritchey - chretien telescope @xcite with a focal length of 17600 mm , on an equatorial fork mount ; the intrinsic image quality is 04 .    ]",
    "the prime goal for grond is to investigate the high - redshift universe , thus emphasis was put on the nir channels , and not on the visual ones .",
    "consequently , it was decided to develop a focal reducer in the nir with a 10@xmath12 10  field - of view in order to cover grb error boxes with a typical error radius of a few arcmin ( anticipated to occur about twice per week ) .",
    "in contrast , in the visual channels , no lens system was planned and the plate scale provided by the telescope optics was used .    the separation of the different photometric bands has been achieved using dichroics , whereby the short wavelength part of the light is always reflected off the dichroic , while the long - wavelength part passes through .",
    "thus , the first dichroics are used to split off the visual bands which is done in the converging beam before the telescope focus .",
    "the relatively short back focal distance of 550 mm implied very tight constraints on separating the beams and still having enough space for the detectors .",
    "this , unfortunately , also prohibited using larger - format ccd detectors , since the consequently larger beams could not be separated further .    after passing a diaphragm at the nominal telescope focal plane ,",
    "the beam is folded by 180  for space constraints , and fed into a collimator ( fig .",
    "[ optlayout ] , [ 3dopt ] ) .",
    "the splitting of the three near - infrared channels occurs in the parallel beam between collimator and camera objective of the nir focal reducer .",
    "one might expect different ghosting effects in the visual arm ( dichroics in converging beam ) and the near - ir arm ( parallel beam ) . while it is true that reflections from the back surface of the dichroic in the parallel beam produce ghosts which are not offset relative to the main image , the effect of these ghosts is negligible .",
    "both the dichroic as well as the anti - reflection coatings have efficiencies of about 99.5% in their transmitting regions . since back surface ghosts involve two coating passages , they arrive with @xmath130.0025% ( corresponding to 11 mag fainter ) of the original intensity , undiscernable in data analysis .    another typical concern of dichroics is their polarisation dependent location of the cut wavelengths , in particular since gamma - ray burst afterglow emission shows variable optical / nir polarisation .",
    "we have therefore embarked on a dedicated study of this effect prior to the coating of the optics .",
    "while standard cut wavelengths differ by 7% ( 3 - 4% ) for dichroic cubes ( plan - parallel plates ) between the perpendicular polarisation directions , the final grond coatings only have a difference of 1% ( e.g. 15 nm for the @xmath14 dichroic coating ) .",
    "for a 100% polarised white light beam this leads to a 0.1% change in the transmitted flux , which in turn implies a 10@xmath15% change in the color terms ( see @xmath66.2 ) , and thus is tolerable .",
    "the entire system has been designed for a working temperature of 80 k in vacuum , because deviations from the nominal temperature by more than 20 degrees would lead to refractive index changes large enough to cause noticable image quality degradation , and we considered it too risky to predict an equilibrium temperature gradient between the visual and nir part . since the mechanical assembly was done at room temperature , all optics ( and mechanical ) system parameters had to be calculated for a temperature of 80 k. for example , the focal length of the focal reducer differs by 3 mm between 293 k and 80 k , compared to a depth of focus of 25 @xmath16 m .",
    "we imposed a high accuracy requirement on the mechanical support structure , so that an alignment of the optics system is only required along the optical axis .",
    "for the visual channels the incoming 1:8 telescope beam is split using 4 dichroics ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ optlayout ] ) .",
    "the field of view is determined by the telescope focal length ( 17.6 m ) and the size of the ccds ( @xmath17 m ) . for each ccd",
    "the field of view is @xmath18 arcmin@xmath19 , and the plate scale is 0158/pixel .",
    "all four ccds are backside illuminated e2v devices without anti - blooming structures and are operated in inverted ( aimo ) mode .",
    "the chips come on nickel plated ceramic base plates .",
    "since each of the detectors serves in one and only one filter band , different sensitisations of the detectors have been applied : @xmath20 : astro - broadband on normal silicon , @xmath21 : mid - band on normal silicon , @xmath22 and @xmath23 : basic - nir on deep - depletion silicon .",
    "the use of dichroics implies that adjacent bands have identical 50% transmission wavelengths , making the sloan filter system @xcite the obvious choice .",
    "thus , the dichroics were designed such that the combination of their cut - off wavelengths defines bands identical to the sloan system , with the exception of the @xmath22 band . since in the sloan system @xmath24 overlap at their @xmath2570% transmission values",
    ", we decided to compromise the @xmath22 band in favour of standard - width @xmath21 and @xmath23 bands .",
    "channel only involves reflections from the dichroics , and therefore is symmetric ( and thus shows the image quality provided by the three mirrors of the telescope ) .",
    "each panel is 27@xmath16m@xmath1227@xmath16 m , corresponding to 2x2 pixels of the detector .",
    "[ visspot ] ]    the telescope beam is first split by reflecting off the @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands , then the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands . the long wavelength part of the beam ( the nir part ) is then passed through the primary cold stop in the focal plane .",
    "two further dichroics are placed into each of the two visual beams to separate @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the dichroic plates are wedge shaped by @xmath251319 arcmin so that they compensate for the astigmatism of a plane - parallel plate in the converging 1:8 beam of the telescope @xcite .",
    "the curvature of the focal plane of the telescope has a radius of 2205 mm , which corresponds to a focus difference of 43@xmath16 m between the center and edge of the ccd .",
    "this is smaller than the depth of focus of @xmath2560@xmath16 m at the shortest wavelength used , but of course causes astigmatism ( see fig .",
    "[ visspot ] ) .",
    "originally , no other optics were planned except for the dichroics .",
    "after first light it became apparent that the @xmath20 and @xmath22 bands suffered from single reflections of @xmath21 and @xmath23 light , respectively , off the backside of the dichroics , at a strength of about 0.5% of the incident intensity .",
    "thus , each of the ccd channels has been equipped with a short - pass filter to block these single reflections .",
    "the backsides of those 3 mm glass filters have anti - reflection coatings at @xmath2699.5% efficiency , except for the @xmath20-band ( see below ) .",
    "another post - commissioning change has been implemented for the @xmath20 band : originally , no short - wavelength cutoff was foreseen , since we expected the transmission of the telescope mirrors and the entrance window as well as the efficiency of the ccd detector to fall off rapidly enough below @xmath25400 nm . in fact , the ill - defined cut - off led to a photometric uncertainty of about 5% which was deemed unacceptable ( see @xmath6[limmag ] ) .",
    "we therefore implemented a short - wavelength edge - filter with a cut - off wavelength of 380 nm .",
    "the nir part is designed as a focal reducer system allowing for an optimized adjustment of the focal length , or equivalently the field of view . in this way",
    "the required 10  fov is imaged onto a @xmath27 rockwell hawaii-1 array ( pixel size",
    "18.5@xmath16 m , plate scale of 060/pixel ) .",
    "the focal reducer system ( 5 collimator lenses with a resulting f@xmath28=360 mm and 6 camera lenses with f@xmath29=129.6 mm for each nir channel ) has a pupil reduction factor of 48.89 and a pupil diameter of 45 mm .",
    "for the f/8 telescope the resulting effective focal length is 6336 mm .",
    "a diaphragm is placed in the telescope and collimator focus , including blocking of the m2 mirror and m2 spider structure .",
    "the two beam splitters for reflecting off the @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands are located in the parallel beam of the focal reducer , between collimator and the camera objectives ( fig .",
    "[ optlayout ] , [ 3dopt ] ) .",
    "in addition , each channel has a cold pupil stop near the dichroic , as well as a filter in front of the first camera lens defining the standard @xmath1 bands ( which also prohibit long - wavelengths single reflections to reach the detector ) .",
    "the @xmath1 filters differ from canonical nir filters in their much reduced blocking range which is sufficient for grond because of the action of the dichroics .",
    "thus , the mean transmission in the @xmath1 bands ( including dichroics ) is 98% .    because of the parallel beam",
    ", the dichroics could be manufactured as true plane parallel plates and mounted in a compact 60  box which allows for a space - saving splitting of the beam into the @xmath32 and @xmath8 channels .",
    "the @xmath8 channel includes an additional flip mirror for dithering purposes .",
    "but for the three infrared channels .",
    "the focal reducer was designed to optimize the image quality ( point source shape ) , but still contains image distortions , i.e. plate scale changes depending on the position in the focal plane .",
    "these geometrical distortions are corrected during the data reduction process ( see @xmath6[pipeii ] ) .",
    "each panel is 37@xmath16m@xmath1237@xmath16 m , corresponding to 2x2 pixels of the detector .",
    "[ irspot ] ]    the focal reducer system designed for grond differs substantially from that of other optical focal reducer systems ( e.g. the calar alto faint object spectrograph cafos , the multi object spectrogragh for calar alto mosca , or the potsdam multi - aperture spectrophotometer pmas @xcite at calar alto ) , since no optical glasses could be used .",
    "basically only four media are available for transmission in the 9002400 nm range : caf@xmath33 , baf@xmath33 , oh - free silica and undoped yag .",
    "because of its transmission characteristics , yag is particularly suited for nir optics ( but also difficult to grow in large dimensions ) . using these four optical media , and after measuring their refractive indices at the foreseen operational temperature of 80 k , the focal reducer system could be designed with a high performance ( fig .",
    "[ irspot ] ) using software developed by us ( laux  1999 ) .",
    "the 3d visible and nir model as well as the optics components cad files were created using the zemax software package .        the grond cryostat ( fig .",

    "the components inside the grond cryostat have different thermal requirements .",
    "in addition , in the case of single component failures , no sensitive components should be exposed to dangerous thermal conditions .",
    "the complete internal structure is mounted on a titanium alloy ( tialv ) plate that provides thermal insulation .",
    "this plate is mounted on the front plate of the cryostat , which accordingly becomes the nominal reference point of the system . as the different components ( front plate , titanium plate , optical bench ) have different temperatures , the mounting must allow for thermal contractions .",
    "this is achieved by using long holes and centering pins to mount the titanium plate .",
    "the internal components ( optical benches ) are connected to the back plate of the cryostat using a metallic membrane that allows contractions only along the optical axis of the instrument .",
    "the cooling system is based on a two - stage sumitomo closed - cycle cooler ( ccc ) with a srdk-408-s cold head which provides a cooling power of 35 w down to 45k at the warm stage , and 6.3 w down to 10k at the cold stage .",
    "the cold head is mounted using a bellow ( to reduce vibrations ) on the back plate of the vessel .",
    "the first stage of the ccc ( higher temperature and higher cooling power ) is used to cool the optical benches ( visual and near - ir ) and all optics components to 80k ( temperature - controlled ) . the second stage ( lower temperature and lower cooling power )",

    "thermal connections between the two baseplates and the components are realised using copper flanges , copper ledges and flexible copper lines .",

    "the cylinder segments are additionally covered with multi - layer insulation foil .     ]",
    "the implementation of the optical requirements with the geometrical and mechanical constraints such as tight space , minimum weight and different temperature regions within the main housing resulted in substantial complexity which in turn required most sub - units and their interrelations to be treated simultaneously .",
    "the development of the optical / mechanical configuration included considerations such as : ( i ) space requirements for the 4 ccd cameras and 3 nir - detector units , ( ii ) use of structural components , such as optical benches , mounting interfaces / connections , and cold connections , ( iii ) assembly and handling procedures , ( iv ) cabling , ( v ) low - temperature induced contractions interacting in 3 dimensions .",

    "the tight space constraints also made it necessary to develop a new , much smaller detector board ( shrinking from originally 220 mm diameter to a square of 50x70 mm ) . consequently , the mechanics also had to be re - designed from scratch and the opportunity was taken to implement two new features : ( i ) motorised positioning of the detector along the optical axis , and ( ii ) a gimbal mounting to allow manual alignment of the detector plane perpendicular to the optical axis in both degrees of freedom ( fig .",

    "linear motors are used for moving the m3 mirror and the main shutter door in front of the entrance window .",
    "the board works with two limit switches , between which the motor can move .",
    "the forward  backward movement of the mirror is possible by software - controlled command ( from the grond instrument workstation ) or manually over a special control box at the telescope s m1 mirror cell .",
    "_ resolver boards _    an ad2s82a represents the main part of the resolver board , which is a variable resolver - to - digital converter .",
    "the resolution of this converter is variable and can be set up to 16 bit , which means that a maximum resolution of approximately 20 arcsec is possible .",
    "the sine - wave for the ltn resolver is produced by the maximum high frequency waveform generator max038 .",
    "this produces an optimal signal for the resolver .",
    "a high speed voltage follower is connected at the outlet side to provide a high current driver for long cables .",
    "likewise the offset of the sine - wave can be adjusted with a voltage buffer .",
    "all resolver boards used in the grond electronic rack have the following configuration : resolution : 16 bit ; peak - to - peak sine wave amplitude : 2 v ; frequency : 10khz ; offset : 0v .",
    "finally , the primary power of all motor power supplies is switched on by a zero crossing switch .",
    "this prevents a high inrush current on the main power line during switch on .    _ temperature control _",
    "the electronic rack has two temperature control systems .",
    "the temperatures of the nir detector system is monitored by lakeshore temperature controllers .",
    "each of the three nir detectors has its own lakeshore controller ls331 which in turn has two control loops : loop1 with 50w maximum heating power is used to warm up and regulate parts of the baseplate .",
    "loop2 with 1w maximum heating power controls the detector temperature with an accuracy of @xmath360.1deg .",
    "the nominal operating temperature of the grond nir detectors is 65k .    for the optical ccds , temperature sensors and controlled heaters",
    "are directly mounted to the ccd detector backside and controlled via pulpo ( see section [ pulpo ] ) .",
    "since each pulpo can control only one shutter , two pulpos are incorporated in the electronic rack .",
    "the nominal heating power of the pulpo is 7w in each circuit . for safety reasons , the power at the ccds",
    "was reduced to 1w .",
    "a third heater , also controlled by each pulpo , is mounted on each of the two clock - bias board thermal shields , with 7w heating power .",
    "* irace : * the readout system for the infrared detectors , the irace ( infrared detector high speed array control and processing electronics ; meyer  1998 ) system , was supplied by eso .",
    "as read - out mode ( ` imode ` ) , the double - correlated mode is used , as it is the only valid mode for science observations .",
    "one change was made to the basic irace system , namely to read out all three detectors simultaneously and store the data into one fits file .",
    "* fiera : * the fiera ( fast imager electronic readout assembly ; beletic  1998 ) system was also provided by eso .",
    "implemented changes include ( i ) independent read - out for two pairs of ccds ; ( ii ) a 3.8 m instead of the nominal 1.8 m cable to the front - end electronics ( which does not increase readout noise ) . for grond , the two - port readout of each detector is used and one fits file with four separate extensions is written after each exposure ( the two read - out ports are combined into one image before writing to file ) .",
    "furthermore , two read - out speeds are typically used : the fast mode ( 625 kpixel / s ; read - out noise of @xmath923 e@xmath38 ) in the 4 min and 6 min observation blocks ( see below ) , and the slow mode ( 50 kpixel / s , @xmath95 e@xmath38 ) in all longer observation blocks .",
    "the fiera system includes pulpo @xcite , a separate electronics box used to measure and control temperatures ( via 3 heaters ) , measure the vacuum in the cryostat ( two inputs ) , and to operate one shutter .",
    "the grond operation scheme is designed to be as generic as feasible , but primarily suitable for prompt , automatic grb follow up observations .",
    "additionally , it should provide the basic functionality to perform observations of any other , non - transient object .",
    "however , operating a seven channel imager in a single cryostat implies various observational constraints which should be considered in the creation of the observation blocks ( obs ; chavan  2000 ) .",
    "each observation is built by combining exposures ( differing in number and length ) of the seven detectors based on an appropriate set of parameters .",
    "this approach provides the most generic background for science observations with the current instrument design .",
    "the most important parameters are the number of telescope dither positions ` ntd ` , the number of telescope pointings ` ntp ` , the number of exposures in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 band ` ngr ` , the number of exposures in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 band ` niz ` , the corresponding integration times ` uitgr ` and ` uitiz ` , the number of @xmath8 mirror dither positions ` nmd ` , the number of @xmath8 mirror pointings ` nmp ` , the number of @xmath1 exposures in a single @xmath8 mirror position ` nint ` , the number of stacked @xmath1 exposures ` ndit ` , and the @xmath1 integration time ` dit ` .    in order to comply with the grond science objectives ,",
    "different default ob types are defined for autonomous observations of grb afterglows .",
    "the obs are named after the total integration time in the @xmath8 band , namely 4  min , 8  min , 20  min and 40  min obs , all with 4 different telescope dither positions , as well as 6  min , 12  min , 30  min and 60  min obs with 6 telescope dither positions .",
    "all parameters for grond observations can be adapted for use in non - standard obs , within their constraints as described above .",
    "however , all bands and their readout have to be synchronised for telescope dithering , which means that the integration time of the optical bands must be adapted to the parameters of the infrared observations ( and/or vice versa ) . for non - standard obs , this remains the responsibility of the user .    by default , one standard ob consists of four or six telescope dither positions : ` ntd = ntp=4 or 6 ` , each with six @xmath8 band mirror dither positions ( ` nmd = nmp=6 ` ) .",
    "a total of ` nint`=1 , 2 , 5 and 10 single @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath8 integrations are possible at each @xmath8 mirror dither position .    a generic break - down of the shortest 4  min ob and the underlying structure in a single telecope dither position can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : grondcam ] .",
    "schemes for the other default obs differ in the number of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath8 integrations ( ` nint ` ) and telescope ditherings ( ` ntd ` ) , and the ccd detector read - out mode ( ` omode ` ) .",
    "the grond instrument software is based on the standard eso / vlt software environment .",
    "the ccd detectors are handled as a normal array of 4 chips , each with 2-port read - out .",
    "the single fiera controller drives all 4 chips .",
    "the two shutters are operated in parallel . in order to integrate longer in the bluer ( @xmath34 ) channels ,",
    "two special read - out modes were introduced : one that drives only the @xmath35 ccds ( i.e. one can read out only these two chips while leaving the image in the other two intact ) and a second read - out where the @xmath34 chips are not wiped / reset at the start of the exposure .",
    "when combined , these two readout modes allow a special operation mode where one takes one @xmath34 image for every two @xmath35 frames .",
    "thus , in the bluer channels the efficiency is significantly improved due to the additional exposure time .",
    "there is a resulting trade off between the dark time ( between reset / wipe and read - out ) and the exposure time in the @xmath34 channels .",
    "the latter can not be precisely known because of the not exactly predictable overhead of a fiera exposure . as",
    "the dark current is negligible in the ccds , this trade off is justified . for very short exposures of very bright targets a fast read - out mode",
    "is also provided , which reduces the read - out time from 46s to 4.4s .",
    "the near - ir chips are operated normally .",
    "the 3 chips with 4 amplifiers each are treated as 12 video channels and are stored in a single frame .",
    "this implies that all three chips must be read out together . as a consequence ,",
    "the efficiency of the @xmath14 channels are slightly reduced : this is because the integration time for faint targets is limited by the sky brightness in the @xmath8-band to @xmath2510 seconds while the other two bands could , in principle , integrate longer .",
    "this results in a 2 second overhead .",
    "in addition , the @xmath14 chips must also wait for the dither mirror movements resulting in an additional 0.5sec overhead for each mirror movement .",
    "there is no additional read - out noise due to the larger number of @xmath14 reads since the total noise is dominated by poisson noise of the sky background .",
    "the two arms ( optical and near - ir ) are operated in semi - parallel .",
    "both detector systems are started independently consecutively ( within milliseconds ) and the requested number of frames are taken with as little dead time as possible .",
    "in general the two detector systems are _ not _ synchronised  except after telescope slews .",
    "the instrument control software has no provisions to fill the time available between telescope movements .",
    "it is the user s responsibility to request the optimal number of exposures . in order to ease this task ,",
    "a few optimal configurations are offered .",
    "relatively frequent telescope offsets are required to be able to determine the sky variations in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 band ( the @xmath8-band is handled by the built - in dither mirror ) . in order to increase efficiency and to simplify usage , the dither pattern is a predefined circle  the user only defines the number of dither positions .",
    "grond uses so - called combined offsets , i.e. guiding continues without operator interaction after a telescope offset . the operator is only required to select the guide star at the beginning of an ob .",
    "observations , both in visitor and service mode , are done through obs .",
    "the user can use the normal p2pp tool ( p2pp manual 2007 ) like for any eso instrument ( despite grond not being an official eso instrument ) . in the case of grb observations ,",
    "obs are generated in real time by a special process .",
    "the input parameters are provided by the grond pipeline host ( see next section ) , which is translated into a standard ob . to reduce overheads",
    ", the instrument workstation always provides the current telescope pointing to the pipeline machine .",
    "thus , the pipeline may conclude that the current pointing is good enough ( i.e. the aim coordinate and error circle fall within the field - of - view of the optical ccds ) and skip the telescope preset . in this case guiding will continue without operator interaction , even when executing several obs consecutively ( guiding does not stop at the end of an ob ) . at the start of each ob ,",
    "the instrument is focused by moving m2 ( see @xmath6[foc ] .",
    "as grond is fine - tuned for grb follow - up where speed is crucial , no manual focusing is foreseen before a grb observation starts  but the necessary templates are available for standard observing runs .    to make data analysis easier , all images produced by grond contain important information in the fits headers .",
    "thus , the images can be fed into standard software such as iraf as the required header cards describing the bias / trim / overscan regions and amplifiers are included .",
    "the visual channels are also identified by the header ( @xmath0 ) ; the infrared channels are in one image ( see above ) .",
    "obviously , all other relevant parameters ( gain , read - out noise , etc . ) are also included for each chip in the header .",
    "crude astrometry ( wcs cards ) is also included in each image . in the optical",
    "the astrometry is correct , apart from a shift introduced by the pointing of the telescope .",
    "the astrometry is correct for all chips ( i.e. individual chip shifts , rotations , etc .",
    "are included ) .",
    "as there are no significant distortions in the optical channels , the astrometry is very accurate ( 02 )  once the pointing origin is fixed . in the near - ir channels ,",
    "the astrometry does _ not _ include the focal plane distortions ( which is significant due to the focal reducer ) .",
    "furthermore , the near - ir detector system produces a single image so an extra processing step is required to slice the image into the three bands and to extract the necessary information from the header .",
    "the header cards also take into account the @xmath8-band dithering mirror position .      [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      a first set of calibration observations was performed during mid - july 2007 , though not in photometric conditions .",
    "thus , the constants in the following equations may change slightly ( see www.mpe.mpg.de/~jcg/grond for updates ) .",
    "first , we derive transformation equations between the grond ( g ) visual bands and the sloan ( s ) filter system :    @xmath39 + @xmath40 + @xmath41 + @xmath42    next , the transformations between the grond nir bands and the 2mass ( 2 m ) system are as follows :    @xmath43 + @xmath44 + @xmath45    for transformation from 2mass to other systems see carpenter ( 2003 ) .    finally , the transformations between the visual grond bands and the wfi ( w ) system are :    @xmath46 + @xmath47 + @xmath48 + @xmath49    only for the @xmath21 band we reach a residual 1% rms scatter , while for @xmath22 and @xmath23 the residual rms scatter is 2% . for",

    "grond is an imaging system capable of operating in seven colors simultaneously .",
    "it has been designed and built at mpe garching , and commissioned at the 2.2 m mpi / eso telescope on la silla , chile .",
    "first observations show that all properties are according to specifications / expectations .",
    "the first observations of gamma - ray bursts with grond have also been obtained ( greiner  2007a , b ; primak  2007 , krhler  2007 ) .",
