    "lifshitz published his famous analysis of the low - energy tails of the density @xmath12 of states of an electron in a medium with randomly scattered immobile impurities  @xcite .",
    "he demonstrated that , in @xmath2-dimensions , the spectrum @xmath12 of the random schrdinger operator decays as @xmath13 this exponential decay is in striking contrast to the polynomial decay associated with a periodic schrdinger operator , and is caused by the presence of arbitrarily large , albeit rare , regions without impurities .",
    "a decade later balagurov and vaks  @xcite and donsker and varadhan  @xcite published their celebrated work on trapping kinetics in a medium with randomly placed immobile traps ( called @xmath4 ) .",
    "they found that the long - time decay of the survival probability @xmath14 of a particle ( called @xmath1 ) diffusing in such a @xmath2 dimensional medium follows the stretched - exponential law @xmath15 where @xmath3 is the mean density of traps , @xmath16 is the particle diffusion coefficient , and @xmath17 is the @xmath2-dependent constant  @xcite @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the first zero of the bessel function @xmath20 and @xmath21 $ ] denotes the volume of a @xmath2-dimensional sphere of unit radius .",
    "the superscript @xmath4 on the survival probability emphasizes that the traps @xmath4 are immobile .",
    "balagurov and vaks obtained the decay form in eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) exactly for @xmath22 . while they furthermore deduced this behavior for general @xmath2 by noticing the close mathematical connection between the trapping problem and the lifshitz problem , donsker and varadhan",
    "were the first to obtain the rigorous exact solution of this essentially many - body problem in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "they determined not only the time dependence but also the decay coefficient @xmath17 of eq .",
    "( [ ll ] ) . note that this law stands in stark contrast to the purely exponential decay predicted by standard chemical kinetics for the reaction @xmath23 of mobile particles and traps , and even to the predictions of the smoluchowski approach based on a reaction - diffusion equation , @xmath24 , &   d=1\\\\ \\exp [ - 4 \\pi \\rho d t/\\ln(d t / a^2 ) ] , &   d=2 \\\\ \\exp ( - 4 \\pi \\rho d t ) , & d=3 \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the sum of the diffusion coefficients of the particle and the traps  @xcite .    in mathematical analogy with the source of the lifshitz tail ,",
    "the decay law  ( [ tr ] ) arises from the presence of arbitrarily large regions without traps in which the particle can diffuse for a relatively long time before being trapped .",
    "although the survival probability of a particle in any one such region is purely exponential , the ensemble average over a random distribution of such trap - free voids produces the anomalously slow decay .    the decay law in eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) has been also generalized to trapping reactions on fractals and in inhomogeneous structures  @xcite , to @xmath1 particles performing subdiffusive motion  @xcite or attached to the extremities of polymer chains @xcite , and also to agglomerated random distributions of traps distributed on immobile polymer chains in solution  @xcite or in clusters  @xcite .",
    "the history of this problem and many other results have been summarized in several reviews ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the survival probability eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) [ as well as the lifshitz tail result of eq .",
    "( [ dens ] ) ] is valid only when the traps ( or impurities ) are strictly immobile .",
    "indeed , if one allows them to diffuse , no matter how small the diffusion coefficient , the particle survival probability is described by a faster decay law . as proved by bramson and lebowitz @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , when both species diffuse , the survival probability of the @xmath1 particle at long times is given by @xmath26 the time dependences are the same as in the smoluchowski problem , but the constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 are in general different , may depend on the diffusion coefficients of the particle and of the traps ( but see below ) , and were not determined in this original work .    when traps diffuse , the many - body trapping effects captured by eq .",
    "are thus no longer applicable and the @xmath1 particle survival probability decays with time according to the faster time dependencies in eq .",
    "( [ bramsleb ] ) .",
    "the underlying fluctuation mechanism governing the trapping dynamics has changed when the traps are allowed to move . while the time dependence in the decay laws  ( [ bramsleb ] ) is consistent with smoluchowski - like results , which in fact represent a two - body approximation , the decay amplitudes @xmath29 are not simply functions of the sum of the diffusion coefficients .",
    "in particular , the exact form ( including the coefficients ) of the leading large-@xmath30 behavior for @xmath22 and @xmath31 has only recently been found by bray and blythe  @xcite and , surprisingly , @xmath32 and @xmath33 depend only on the diffusion coefficient @xmath34 of the traps and are independent of @xmath16 , the diffusion coefficient of the @xmath1 particle !",
    "this implies that the survival probability of the diffusing @xmath1 particle in this scenario is asymptotically identical to that of an @xmath1 particle that remains still , that is , to @xmath35 .",
    "this remarkable result has subsequently been extended to systems in which both the particles and the traps move subdiffusively  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is again found that the survival probability of a subdiffusive @xmath1 particle in a sea of subdiffusive traps is identical to that of and @xmath1 particle that remains still ( as in the bramson - lebowitz scenario ) , @xmath36 . however , it is still not clear what happens when traps move subdiffusively and the particle is diffusive . in one dimension",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the asymptotic survival probability of the diffusing particle is the same when surrounded by subdiffusive traps characterized by a mean square displacement that grows as @xmath5 with @xmath37 as it is for a stationary particle , _ provided the subdiffusive traps move sufficiently rapildy _",
    "( @xmath38 ) , again akin to the bramson - lebowitz scenario .",
    "however , few results seem to be currently available for @xmath39 and/or if the subdiffusive traps are  too slow .",
    "\" an interesting question is then the following : will the trapping tails associated with immobile traps withstand sufficiently slow sub - diffusion , thus leading to a survival probability such as that of the donsker - varadhan result , or will they switch to appropriately rescaled bramson - lebowitz forms ?",
    "this is the main question that we pose in this paper .    in this pursuit",
    ", we follow the general idea  @xcite of constructing lower and upper bounds on the survival probability of a diffusive particle in a sea of subdiffusive traps whose motion is described by a continuous time random walk that starts at time @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "if these bounds coincide asymptotically , then we can extract an exact asymptotic result for the survival probability of the particle .",
    "we write the asymptotic survival probability in the form @xmath41 where the constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 depend on @xmath11 and on dimension , and explore whether a convergence of upper and lower bounds provides the exponents @xmath43 and perhaps even the exponential prefactor @xmath42 .",
    "we broadly anticipate our results by noting that if the subdiffusive particles are sufficiently slow , specifically if @xmath7 , these bounds lead to a donsker - varadhan behavior , and the lifshitz or trapping tails thus remain unchanged . if @xmath8 and @xmath44 , then the bounds lead to a bramson - lebowitz behavior that is , a survival probability behavior associated with a stationary particle ( note that , albeit for a different system , this result is implicit in  @xcite ; that work addresses diffusive particles in a fractal medium , while here we are considering subdiffusive motion in euclidean geometries ) .",
    "however , if @xmath8 and @xmath45 we are not able to establish a unique asymptotic behavior .",
    "the detailed results are exhibited later in the paper .    in sec .",
    "[ model ] we formulate the model of moving particle and traps . in sec .",
    "[ lowerbound ] we calculate a lower bound on the survival probability of the particle , and in sec .  [ upperbound ] we obtain two upper bounds .",
    "the consequences of these bounds on the survival probability are collected in sec .",
    "[ collection ] .",
    "a brief recapitulation of the results is given in the concluding section .",
    "in this section we formulate the general model that allows us to highlight the approximations made to obtain upper and lower bounds on the survival probability .",
    "consider a @xmath2-dimensional system of volume @xmath46 containing a single _ diffusive _ @xmath1 particle of radius @xmath47 and @xmath48 randomly moving point traps @xmath4 ( a finite trap radius would add nothing interesting to the problem for our purposes ) .",
    "the initial position of @xmath1 is the origin , and one realization of its trajectory is denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "the starting points @xmath50 of the traps are randomly ( poisson ) distributed throughout the volume , and a trajectory of the @xmath51th trap is denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "next we define @xmath53 the indicator function @xmath54 $ ] of the event that the @xmath1 particle has not met any of the @xmath4s up to time @xmath30 for a given realization of their trajectories can then be written as @xmath55=\\prod_{k=1}^k   \\psi[{\\bm a}_t,{\\bm b}_t^{(k ) } ] = \\prod_{k=1}^k \\exp\\left[- \\int^t_0   v({\\bm a}_{\\tau } - { \\bm b}_{\\tau}^{(k ) } - { \\bm b}_0^{(k ) } ) d\\tau\\right].\\ ] ] consequently the @xmath1 particle survival probability is @xmath56 \\right\\}\\right)\\right\\},\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath57 denotes an average over all @xmath1 particle trajectories @xmath49 that start at the origin .",

    "we have labeled each of the latter trajectories by a trap label @xmath51 , but since the traps move independently we can omit the label .",

    "nevertheless , it unfortunately does not seem possible to evaluate the survival probability exactly from this expression , the main mathematical difficulty being that the average over all possible trajectories @xmath66 has to be performed for each fixed @xmath65 . only after this average has been performed can one then go on to carry out the further average over the @xmath1 particle trajectories .",
    "this appears to be a non - tractable mathematical problem , and recourse has to be made to controllable approximations .",
    "we do it here by constructing lower and upper bounds on @xmath0 and identifying conditions and regimes where these converge asymptotically .",
    "a lower bound was originally devised in  @xcite for diffusive particles and traps and was extended in  @xcite to the case of ( sub)diffusive particles and traps .",
    "we adapt this method to the current situation in which the traps @xmath4 perform continuous - time random walks , so that we may restate this bound in the language introduced above . following bray and blythe ,",
    "we introduce a notional spherical volume @xmath68 of radius @xmath69 centered at the origin , and pick only those realizations of initial trap distributions for which this volume is completely devoid of traps . the probability that the region will initially be empty of traps is @xmath70 we furthermore introduce the probability @xmath71 that the @xmath1 particle does not leave the notional volume @xmath68 during time @xmath30  @xcite , @xmath72 thirdly",
    ", we introduce the probability that no @xmath4 particle enters the notional volume up to time @xmath30 , that is , the probability that an immobile @xmath2-dimensional target of radius @xmath69 survives up to time @xmath30 in the presence of a concentration @xmath3 of traps all of which perform subdiffusive motion  @xcite : @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the gamma function , and @xmath34 is the anomalous diffusion coefficient of the traps , that is , the coefficient in the mean square displacement relation @xmath75 .",
    "since the functional in eq.([l ] ) is positive definite , the two latter constraints on the trajectories of @xmath1 and the @xmath4s naturally lead to a lower bound on the survival probability @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , for these constrained trajectories the functional in eq.([w ] ) is strictly equal to zero , and hence eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) restricted in this way is equal to unity . as a consequence , the probabilities associated with the random processes @xmath65 and @xmath66 subject to these constraints can simply be factored , immediately leading to the lower bound on @xmath0 @xmath76 finally , we note that this lower bound @xmath77 is in fact a family of lower bounds dependent on the radius @xmath69 of the notional volume separating particle and traps . this radius can be chosen to give the best lower bound , that is , the maximal lower bound , which we simply denote as @xmath78 .",
    "the optimal radii are shown explicitly in appendix  [ appa ] , and are shown to depend on dimensionality and on @xmath11 .",
    "the associated optimal lower bounds for the survival probability of @xmath1 , which also depend on dimensionality and on @xmath11 , then immediately follow .",
    "we thus have @xmath79 where , for @xmath80 , @xmath81 for @xmath31 we have @xmath82 for @xmath10 the results are @xmath83 there is thus a change in behavior of the lower bound in all dimensions when @xmath11 crosses the value @xmath84 .",
    "an upper bound on the survival probability @xmath0 of the diffusive particle was recently derived on the basis of the so - called  pascal principle , \" which states that the @xmath1 particle survives longer if it remains still than if it moves .",
    "the problem with a static @xmath1 particle and moving traps is the so - called  target problem , \" and consequently we label this upper bound on the survival probability as @xmath85 .",
    "the pascal principle was conjectured in  @xcite and was proved in  @xcite for @xmath80 for conventional diffusive motion . in",
    "@xcite the statement was proved for a rather general class of random walks on @xmath2-dimensional lattices .",
    "a similar statement was introduced more than a decade earlier in  @xcite in the context of excitation energy migration .",
    "this upper bound is given by eq .",
    "( [ ctrw - target ] ) obtained in  @xcite if we set @xmath86 , the radius of the @xmath1 particle . for visual ease",
    "we explicitly rewrite eq .",
    "( [ ctrw - target ] ) with this replacement , @xmath87 to clearly tie together the various notations introduced so far , we note that @xmath88 and @xmath89    however , this upper bound when associated with the lower bound is not always sufficiently tight to provide the desired information about the asymptotic survival probability of the diffusive particle .",
    "we thus introduce and alternative new upper bound , which in some cases is lower than the above . in the next section",
    "we then explicitly pick the bounds to be used and exhibit the information that can be obtained from them .",

    "<S> we study the long - time tails of the survival probability @xmath0 of an @xmath1 particle diffusing in @xmath2-dimensional media in the presence of a concentration @xmath3 of traps @xmath4 that move sub - diffusively , such that the mean square displacement of each trap grows as @xmath5 with @xmath6 . starting from a continuous time random </S>",
    "<S> walk ( ctrw ) description of the motion of the particle and of the traps , we derive lower and upper bounds for @xmath0 and show that for @xmath7 these bounds coincide asymptotically , thus determining asymptotically exact results . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic decay law in this regime is exactly that obtained for immobile traps . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for sufficiently subdiffusive traps , the moving @xmath1 particle sees the traps as essentially immobile , and lifshitz or trapping tails remain unchanged . for @xmath8 and @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> the upper and lower bounds again coincide , leading to a decay law equal to that of a stationary particle . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this regime the moving traps see the particle as essentially immobile . for @xmath10 , however , the upper and lower bounds in this @xmath11 regime no longer coincide and the decay law for the survival probability of the @xmath1 particle remains ambiguous . </S>"
