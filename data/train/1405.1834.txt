    "under - actuated dynamical systems are those that have more degrees - of - freedom than control inputs .",
    "examples include spacecrafts , underwater autonomous vehicles and mobile robots .",
    "control and stabilization of these systems are challenging tasks and are currently hot topics of research for both engineers and applied mathematicians @xcite .",
    "new stabilization strategies are validated and tested on classical benchmark systems such as the ` ball on a beam ' and ` inverted pendulum ' systems @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem comes from introducing some kind of perturbation to these dynamical systems , to study the robustness in front external disturbances @xcite . also , one such systems which has drawn the attention of control researchers is the mobile inverted pendulum ( mip ) which is a two - wheeled robot with a central body that carries a payload .",
    "the robot has the advantage of having a small footprint in addition to its ability to turn about its central axis .",
    "a commercial variant of the mip is the well known segway @xcite .",
    "we can define a segway robotic mobile platform ( rmp ) as self - balancing personal transport unit which is similar to the classic control inverted pendulum stabilization problem .        in this paper , a laboratory device",
    "is designed to create a commanded disturbance to the furuta pendulum ( rotational inverted pendulum ) .",
    "this pendulum is modified by adding a second inverted pendulum coupled to the main one ( see figure [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "the induced motion on the second pendulum causes displacement of the center mass of the system , producing a kind of perturbation similar to that presented on mip transportation unit . roughly speaking , modifying the position of an inverted pendulum ( the person driving the segway )",
    ", the displacement of the base ( the segway ) is obtained . in practice",
    ", we modify an existent experiment furuta pendulum presented in figure [ maq - pendu ] ( provided by ecp - systems ) by replacing weight @xmath0 by this second inverted pendulum .",
    "figures [ fig11 ] and [ fig1 ] present this new experimental realization .",
    "this external perturbation ( second pendulum ) is quantized by measuring its angular position via an encoder from _ passport _ company .",
    "so , we can study directly how this disturbance actuates on our inverted pendulum .",
    "our control objective is to experiment with this dynamic system in order to prove robust stability of an output feedback controller .",
    "many nonlinear results exist in the bibliography , incorporating experimental applications @xcite , but the purpose of the present paper is to design an easy control algorithm that solves a complex nonlinear problem . for linear systems ,",
    "@xmath1 control theory offers the possibility of including robustness considerations explicitly in the design and the opportunity to formulate physically meaningful performance objectives that can be expressed as @xmath1 design specifications @xcite , and solved via the linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) techniques @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to point that firstly the @xmath2 linear controller clammed in @xcite was implemented in our furuta experiment , but experimentally the closed - loop systems was unstable @xcite .",
    "based on lmi techniques , @xcite presents a hierarchy intelligent control scheme for a segway vehicle , but without real experimentation . also , a fuzzy control is designed and implemented to the same problem in @xcite . with simplicity in mind , we propose a linear approach .",
    "an output feedback lmi controller is obtained from the unperturbed model ( the one without the second inverted pendulum )",
    ". the stability is proved , and the controller performance is evaluated experimentally . according to experiments ,",
    "the output feedback lmi controller is robust against this kind of perturbation . in particular , its possible realization as a segway navigation control unit center is proved . for control application on the segway , we use a lmi-@xmath1 controller originally designed to stabilize the inverted pendulum .",
    "we modify it to fit the navigation control objective .",
    "this change consists to do not take into account the displacement variable of the load disk ( see figure [ maq - pendu ] ) , that is , the output control ignores the disk position .",
    "doing this modification on the control law , the disk position moves freely and we obtain navigation .",
    "this paper presents a laboratory device motivating first the segway realization . then , mathematical model as well as the control problem are firstly described in section three . experimental test and results",
    "are commented in section four , showing controller robustness .",
    "finally , section five gives the conclusions .",
    "as it was said in the introduction , under - actuated dynamical systems are those that have more degrees - of - freedom than control inputs .",
    "one such systems which has drawn the attention of control researchers is the mip .",
    "the robot has the advantage of having a small footprint in addition to its ability to turn about its central axis .",
    "a commercial variant of the mip is the well known segway @xcite .",
    "we can define a segway robotic mobile platform ( rmp ) as self - balancing personal transport unit which is similar to the classic control inverted pendulum stabilization problem .",
    "the navigation of this unit is due to , basically , the displacement of the center of mass of the body .",
    "this line of reasoning motivates us our design showed in figures [ fig11 ] and [ fig1 ] . with this new device , the position of the center of gravity of the second inverted pendulum",
    "is modified by hand , to induce a perturbation which produces displacement of the furuta pendulum . at this respect , the main pendulum , attached to the rotating base ( figures [ maq - pendu ] , [ fig11 ] , [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] ) , can emulate the segway machine , with the difference that the segway moves linearly , but the furuta pendulum rotates .",
    "the second inverted pendulum can emulate a person ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the laboratory device is described in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the original experiment is formed by the load and drive disk , with the main pendulum , as figure [ maq - pendu ] shows .",
    "these parts emulate the segway . in this experiment",
    ", we consider the load and drive disk as an ensemble , and we define it as the load disk . at @xmath3",
    "cm ( figure [ 441 ] ) , we place the new device laboratory that emulates the person driving the segway .",
    "its total weight is @xmath4 gr .",
    "the second pendulum is added to change its center of mass .",
    "its weight is @xmath5 gr .",
    "it is possible to modify the weight and structure of the second pendulum changing its end - piece .",
    "we have angular position measurements of the disk ( @xmath6 ) and the main pendulum ( @xmath7 ) . also , the angular position of the second pendulum is measured off - line from the control - loop via an encoder .",
    "the rotating base system driven by a motor shown in figures [ maq - pendu ] and [ 441 ] is representative of the pendulum attached to experimental model 220 apparatus @xcite , where @xmath8 is the magnitude of angular rotation of the disk with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the magnitude of angular rotation of the pendulum with respect to @xmath11 . in the case study described in this paper , the mass set at @xmath12 ( weight @xmath0 in figure [ 441 ] )",
    "is changed by a second inverted pendulum with total mass @xmath4gr ( figures [ fig11 ] and [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the equations of motion for the unperturbed case are obtained from lagrange s equations and may be linearized in the case of @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite : @xmath15where @xmath16 is normalized , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; @xmath19 includes equivalent inertia of all elements that move uniformly with the motor disk ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the pendulum moments of inertia , relative to its center of mass ; @xmath22 is the center of gravity of the combined pendulum road and weight ( @xmath23 ) ; @xmath24 is the gravity constant ; and @xmath25 is the control effort . for more details on parameters and modeling ,",
    "see @xcite .    as equations ( [ ein ] ) and ( [ zwei ] )",
    "suggest , the state vector is defined by @xmath26\\;.\\ ] ] our control purpose is to navigate the load disk , induced by the second pendulum .",
    "this scenario is defined considering the load disk plus the main pendulum as the segway , and the second pendulum as the person driving it .",
    "so , the feedback control must consider the position @xmath10 and velocity @xmath27 of the main pendulum induced by the second pendulum ( by hand in the experiment , but in the future modified using radio control ) . also , the velocity of the load @xmath28 has to be taken into account , because the velocity of the segway must be controlled .",
    "a linear output feedback strategy is adopted to simplify the approach .",
    "in fact , it is convenient to point that firstly the @xmath2 linear controller clammed in @xcite was implemented in our furuta experiment .",
    "notwithstanding , the experimental test indicates that the closed - loop system was unstable .",
    "also , when the state - feedback control was implemented ( full information case ) , the disk returned to its equilibrium position , and we did not obtain navigation ( or segway displacement ) . to obtain navigation",
    ", we have to ignore the load disk position @xmath29 .",
    "that is the reason to consider an output feedback control defined by @xmath30 , with @xmath31 $ ] . in matrix notation",
    ", we have : @xmath32 0&0&1&0\\\\[2ex ] 0&0&0&1\\\\[2ex ] \\end{array}\\right]}_{\\mathbf{c}_2}\\mathbf{x}(t)\\ ] ] remark that @xmath33 is right - hand invertible , that is , there exists @xmath34 such that @xmath35 .",
    "this property will be used in the control synthesis .",
    "only the load disk angle position ( @xmath36 ) and the main pendulum angle position ( @xmath37 ) are available by the experimental platform , but velocities will be required in the control design .",
    "so , an observer is constructed to estimate the velocities @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the control aim of this work is to design a robust control verifying two properties .",
    "one is to ensure local stability .",
    "the other is the requirement imposed to the control design to be robust in front of @xmath40 disturbance .",
    "the problem of robust controller with guaranteed @xmath1 performance is addressed to answer this question : does there exist a feedback control such that the @xmath1 norm of the closed - loop system from input disturbance named @xmath41 to output @xmath42 is less than some prescribed value @xmath43 ?",
