    "the possibility to describe in terms of hydrodynamic equations the evolution of a system where some physical quantities are not conserved is a challenging problem of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "several questions have to be faced as for example the validity of the underlying ( and in practice approximate ) kinetic theory , the choice of the hydrodynamical fields that are supposed to describe the relevant excitations in the problem , or the consistency of the method itself that is used to deduce the coarse - grained description from the kinetic theory .",
    "much attention has been recently paid to such questions , mainly in the field of granular gas dynamics ( see e.g @xcite ) . in such systems ,",
    "the kinetic energy is not conserved , while the linear momentum and number of particles are . however , even for low dissipation , the derivation of the hydrodynamic relations , based on a hard - sphere - like boltzmann equation is not a simple task and several approximations have to be invoked  @xcite .",
    "these difficulties lead to consider some simpler models by choosing ad - hoc collision term in the boltzmann equation .",
    "the so - called maxwell and very hard particles ( vhp ) models  @xcite are particularly interesting and reproduce some qualitative features of the granular gas of inelastic hard spheres  @xcite .",
    "another class of problems for which not only energy but also the density and momentum are not conserved is probabilistic ballistic annihilation ( pba ) .",
    "in such a system , the particles move ballistically between collisions .",
    "when two particles meet , they undergo an instantaneous collision and are removed from the system with probability @xmath0 or undergo an elastic scattering with probability @xmath1 . since collisions are assumed to be instantaneous , two body events only are taken into account .",
    "the pba model was first introduced in one dimension in  @xcite . in the limit @xmath2 , where density , momentum and kinetic energy are conserved ,",
    "one recovers a system of hard spheres for which the hydrodynamic equations are well known  @xcite .",
    "the other limit @xmath3 ( pure annihilation ) has been the object of some work  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in the long time limit the annihilation dynamics is exactly described by the boltzmann equation in dimensions higher than one  @xcite .",
    "this may qualitatively be understood by the fact that the density of the gas decays and , at late times , the packing fraction is very low .",
    "this fact lead to conjecture that the boltzmann equation is an adequate description of pba at late times for @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "given that @xmath0 may be considered as a perturbation parameter allowing to recover the elastic limit , the pba model is particularly interesting in view of testing the relevance and validity of the hydrodynamic description in general , which is a controversial issue and a long term goal of the present work .",
    "the analytical treatment with usual hard sphere dynamics however appears to be quite involved  @xcite , and we study here the simplified maxwell and vhp versions of pba .",
    "the motivation is here is not only to test the ability of simplified kinetic models to mimic the hard sphere dynamics for a model far from equilibrium ( and with no conserved quantity , a more severe situation than that of granular gases ) but also to shed some light on some peculiar features obtained in the hydrodynamic study of ref .",
    "in particular , this work exhibited divergent transport coefficients for a critical value of @xmath0 .",
    "we will see that such singularities are absent in the simplified approaches , which may indicate that they are not associated with any physically relevant phenomenon .",
    "it will also appear that maxwell and vhp approaches provide useful bounds for the hard sphere dynamics , so that similar inequalities as those found in @xcite concerning the scaling exponents can be obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section2 ]",
    "we introduce the boltzmann equation for both maxwell and vhp models of probabilistic ballistic annihilation , as well as the balance equations for the coarse - grained fields . in section  [ section3 ]",
    "we briefly describe the chapman - enskog scheme while section  [ section4 ] is devoted to the maxwell model .",
    "we first find the homogeneous state , and solve the corresponding homogeneous balance equations . to first order in the chapman - enskog expansion",
    "we then study the effect of a small spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "we follow the traditional route to compute the transport coefficients , which consists in truncating the first - order velocity distribution function to the first nonzero term in a sonine polynomial expansion  @xcite .",
    "we then show that this truncation does not constitute an approximation for the transport coefficients since they can be obtained by solving the maxwell model _ exactly _ to first order .",
    "the vhp model is subsequently investigated in section  [ section5 ] .",
    "we first find the homogeneous cooling state , and then solve the corresponding homogeneous equations .",
    "we implement monte carlo simulations in order to check the decay exponents found analytically .",
    "next , we establish the transport coefficients to first order in the chapman - enskog expansion before presenting a comparison of the transport coefficients of the different models . in sec .",
    "[ section6 ] we finally perform a linear stability analysis of the navier - stokes hydrodynamic equations around the spatially homogeneous state , and compare the results with pba of hard spheres .",
    "we show as well that the second order decay rates may accurately be neglected .",
    "our main findings and conclusions are summarized in section  [ section7 ] .",
    "since the underlying calculations of this paper are cumbersome , we present only the main steps in order to focus onto the more relevant results .",
