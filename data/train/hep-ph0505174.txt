    "one of the most important aims of particle physics is the test of models , particularly the standard model . testing the standard model means , on one hand , to increase the accuracy of its parameters and , on the other hand , the search for deviations of its predictions from measured quantities to discover new effects . to do this experiments",

    "therefore theoretical calculations have to be performed with increasing numerical precision .",
    "a parameter of the standard model of particular interest is the strong coupling constant @xmath1 .",

    "this means , we need to calculate large numbers of more and more complicated feynman diagrams . therefore different methods for the evaluation of such multiloop feynman diagrams have been developed .",

    "a prescription to solve problems with a large number of complicated feynman diagrams is to reduce them to a set of master integrals , e.g. by means of the traditional integration by parts method , and then evaluate these .",
    "the aim of the project described in this article is to develop a method for the calculation of massless integrals .",
    "more precisely , we want to consider the planar ( @xmath8 ) and non - planar ( @xmath9 ) three - loop propagator diagrams :    @xmath10 @xmath11    they can be considered as the master integrals of the corresponding class of feynman diagrams , which are `` building blocks '' of the calculations for @xmath5 in @xmath7 . + we are interested in the @xmath12-expansion of the diagrams , where @xmath12 is the parameter of _ dimensional regularization_. this means , the integrals are formally calculated in @xmath13 dimensions and then expanded in @xmath12 . by means of this procedure",

    "renormalization_.    it is thus essential for renormalization to know the pole structure of a feynman diagram and the finite part of the expansion .",
    "however , when one has to deal with products of graphs with poles as in the case of the following diagram ,        which appears within the mentioned calculations of @xmath5 , one has to calculate higher @xmath12 orders of the second factor in order to ensure , that the result is correct up to the finite term .",

    "then the program checks , whether there is an integer relation between the numbers within the desired accuracy .",
    "we used an implementation of this method by o. veretin @xcite .",
    "assuming that the transcendentals are the same as for the planar diagram , as it is the case in the lower orders in @xmath12 , we find the following result for the 2nd order coefficient of the @xmath12 expansion of @xmath9 : @xmath183 this agrees with the analytical result which was found in the meantime @xcite .    comparison of this result with table [ tab_e2_2 ] shows , that all the digits printed for the rho algorithm are correct .",
    "this proves the power of this algorithm for our problem and justifies the confidence in the convergence acceleration techniques retrospectively .",
    "in this section we show that the coefficient of @xmath24 for the planar diagram can be found analytically by means of the described method .",
    "the steps we take are the same as described in section [ nonplanar ] .",
    "the structure of the sums and of the terms are similar and so is the procedure of the calculation .",
    "the difference is , the terms that cause problems in the case of @xmath9 , because we do not know algorithms for their evaluation , do not appear in the case of @xmath8 .",
    "after application of the algorithms we have the sum in the form @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the contribution for @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 @xmath189    @xmath190 consists only of terms that can be calculated with summer .",
    "doing this we arrive at the known result @xmath191",
    "we described a method for the calculation of massless , dimensionally regularized feynman integrals in their @xmath12-expansion .",
    "it is based on the expansion of the integrand in terms of gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "this yields sums over gamma functions which can be expanded in harmonic sums . as a consequence one arrives at sums over rational functions and products of such with harmonic sums which can be simplified by the introduced summation algorithms and then be calculated numerically or analytically .",
    "the procedure in principle is independent of the gegenbauer polynomial technique .",
    "it can be useful wherever there are sums of the described form .",
    "the method should be expandable to more complicated problems , e.g. higher orders of the diagrams under consideration or more complex diagrams .    in the case of the nonplanar diagram we could not get to a complete analytical solution . to achieve this , further knowledge in the summation techniques is required .",
    "for this work we combined the abilities of different computer programs , in particular the pattern matching facilities of mathematica , the code generation functions of maple , and form s power of managing very large expressions .",
    "it is the idea to implement the method in one programming language to make it stand - alone .",
    "this could either be done in form or in c++ .",
    "the summation algorithms of ref .",
    "@xcite have already been implemented in both , the form version has recently been published @xcite . in @xcite also a mathematica implementation was introduced .",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath12 expansion of the nonplanar three - loop - diagram @xmath9 could be calculated numerically to 20 digits @xmath192    the analytical result for the @xmath193 term given in @xcite could be reproduced , @xmath194    application of the pslq algorithm to the @xmath195 term gives @xmath196 which agrees with @xcite .    also the analytical result up to order @xmath24 for the planar diagram was verified .",
