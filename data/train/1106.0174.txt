    "a zero - range process ( zrp ) , which was first introduced in mathematical literature @xcite , is a widely studied markov chain in statistical mechanics .",
    "a homogenous zrp is a system of interacting particles which hop between the lattice sites ( or boxes ) of a homogeneous lattice with the rates that depend only on the number of particles in the departure site .",
    "this can be generalized to a heterogeneous zrp ( hzrp ) in which the particles hop between the lattice sites ( or boxes ) of a heterogeneous lattice so that the particles hopping rates also depend on the departure site .",
    "different types of these processes have been introduced and studied in related literature ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they have also a variety of applications in different fields of physics for instance in transport processes including traffic flows , shaken granular gases , particle condensation and phase separation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is long known and well - stablished that there is possibility for mapping a one - dimensional driven - diffusive system defined on a discrete lattice with periodic boundary conditions onto a zrp @xcite .",
    "+ recently the study of the one - dimensional driven - diffusive systems which can be mapped onto the walk models has drawn physicists attention @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the simplest system of this type , that is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) with open boundaries , can be mapped onto a walk model consisting of different dyck paths @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the asep is a system of hard - core particles moving in a preferred direction on a one - dimensional discrete lattice @xcite .",
    "the hard - core particles are injected from the left boundary of the lattice and hop exclusively toward the right boundary .",
    "finally they leave the lattice from the right boundary .",
    "it has also been shown that the partially asep ( pasep ) in which the hard - core particles can hop both to their leftmost and rightmost neighboring empty lattice sites can be mapped onto a weighted walk model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ in a recent paper @xcite it has been shown that a driven - diffusive system consisting of two different classes of particles defined on a discrete lattice with periodic boundary condition can be mapped onto a two - dimensional walk model .",
    "the system is defined on a ring of length @xmath0 .",
    "it consists of @xmath1 first - class particles and a single second - class particle sometimes called the impurity .",
    "both the first and second - class particles hop in the same preferred direction , and there is no overtaking .",
    "the steady - state of this system was first studied using a matrix product method ( for a review of the matrix product method see @xcite ) in @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the system can be mapped onto a hzrp if one considers the particles ( empty lattice sites ) in the driven - diffusive system as boxes ( particles ) in the hzrp @xcite .",
    "it turns out that if the single second - class particle moves slow enough , a large number of empty lattice sites pile - up in front of it otherwise the number of empty lattice sites in front of the second - class particle is of order @xmath2 . in the equivalent",
    "hzrp these two phases correspond to the cases where the number of particles in the box associated with the second - class particle is either of order of the number of empty lattice sites or @xmath2 . in @xcite the author",
    "has shown that the grand - canonical partition function of this disordered driven - diffusive system is equal to that of a walk model defined on the first quarter of a two - dimensional plane .",
    "the random walker starts from the origin and takes consecutive steps either upward or downward , provided that it does not lie on the horizontal axis .",
    "whenever the random walker lies on the horizontal axis , it can either goes one step upward or moves horizontally . after taking @xmath3 steps it can get to any height between @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "the paths taken by the random walker are weighted . the grand - canonical partition function of walk model is equal to the sum of these weights . if one considers the paths which contain exactly @xmath5 upward steps , then the resulting partition function is exactly that of the disordered driven - diffusive system explained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we start with a generalized disordered driven - diffusive system with long - range interactions defined on a one - dimensional discrete lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we show that the steady - state of this system , which is a product measure , can be obtained using a matrix product method .",
    "the matrices associated with the particles and the empty lattice sites satisfy an algebra which has not been studied thus far .",
    "we discuss how the driven - diffusive system can be mapped onto a hzrp .",
    "both the canonical and grand - canonical partition functions of the hzrp are calculated .",
    "an equivalent walk model is also introduced and studied in detail .",
    "finally , two simple examples are provided to confirm the results .",
    "in @xcite the author has introduced a disorder driven - diffusive system consisting of @xmath6 different particles which hop in a preferred direction on a closed ring of length @xmath0 .",
    "the particles are labeled with @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "a particle of type @xmath7 hops to its rightmost neighboring lattice site with the rate @xmath9 , provided that the target lattice site is not already occupied , according to the following rule : @xmath10 note that the particles do not overtake ; therefore , the sequence of particles is preserved . on the other hand ,",
    "the particle s hopping rate is a constant and depends only on the particle type @xmath7 .",
    "let us denote the number of empty lattice sites in front of a particle of type @xmath7 as @xmath11 . in the steady - state the probability of finding the system in the configuration @xmath12",
    "is given by : @xmath13 in which the normalization factor @xmath14 is called the canonical partition function of the system .",
    "one should also note that @xmath15 . in ( [ pdf1 ] ) the matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 stand for the presence of a particle of type @xmath7 and an empty lattice site respectively .",
    "it has been shown that these matrices satisfy the following quadratic algebra : @xmath18 in @xcite the authors have introduced a matrix representation for the quadratic algebra ( [ algebra1 ] ) as follows : @xmath19 in which @xmath20 . note that @xmath21 is the standard basis of an infinite - dimensional vector space that is @xmath22 . the steady - state probability distribution ( [ pdf1 ] ) can now be calculated and one finds : @xmath23 in which the normalization factor @xmath14 is given by : @xmath24 let us now consider a generalized disordered driven - diffusive system consisting of different types of hard - core particles .",
    "we assume that a particle of type @xmath7 hops one lattice site forward according to the following rule : @xmath25 this is a disordered driven - diffusive system with long - range interactions since the hopping rate of the particle of type @xmath7 , that is @xmath26 , depends on the number of empty lattice sites in front of it .",
    "the steady - state probability distribution of this generalized disordered system @xmath27 is a product measure and can still be written as a trace of a matrix product similar to ( [ pdf1 ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising since this generalized disordered driven - diffusive system can be mapped onto a zrp .",
    "therefore it has a product measure steady - state . in order to verify this , note that the matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 in ( [ pdf1 ] ) satisfy the following algebra : @xmath28 provided that we define @xmath29 and that @xmath30 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the matrix representation ( [ rep1 ] ) satisfies the algebra ( [ algebra2 ] ) . using the algebra ( [ algebra2 ] ) , straightforward calculations",
    "show that the steady - state probability distribution of the generalized disordered driven - diffusive system ( [ pdf1 ] ) can be simplified to ( [ pdf2 ] ) .",
    "+ it should be noted that for the special case @xmath31 ( equivalently @xmath32 ) the matrix representation ( [ rep1 ] ) satisfies both ( [ algebra1 ] ) and ( [ algebra2 ] ) ; however , for a general @xmath26 the matrix representation ( [ rep1 ] ) only satisfies ( [ algebra2 ] ) .",
    "the generalized disordered driven - diffusive system introduced in the previous section can be mapped onto a hzrp . as for this mapping a particle of type @xmath7 in the driven - diffusive system should be considered as the @xmath7th box in the zrp .",
    "the number of empty lattice sites in front of that particle in the driven - diffusive system is then equal to the number of particles in the box associated with that particle . in this case",
    "if the number of particles in the @xmath7th box is @xmath11 then the rate at which a particle moves from @xmath7th box to @xmath33th box is given by @xmath26 .",
    "note that if the particles in the driven - diffusive system move forward , they move backward in the zrp ( see fig .",
    "[ graphics1 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen the particle s hopping rate from one box to the next box depends on both the box number and the number of particles inside it , which can be at most of order of the total number of empty lattice sites in the driven - diffusive system . in fig .",
    "[ graphics1 ] we have provided a simple sketch of such mapping .",
    "mapping between a disordered driven - diffusive system ( above ) and a heterogeneous zero - range process ( below ) with a periodic boundary condition.,width=288 ]    the steady - state of the hzrp defined above is still given by ( [ pdf2 ] ) .",
    "this has already been obtained in @xcite using a different approach .",
    "+ in @xcite the authors have studied a homogeneous zrp and calculated its steady - state probability distribution using a matrix product method similar to that which we have done here .",
    "their algebra and its matrix representation are special cases of ( [ algebra2 ] ) and ( [ rep1 ] ) .",
    "the main difference is that in a homogeneous system the particles hopping rates do not depend on the box number .",
    "in @xcite the author has shown that a simple disordered driven - diffusive system , consisting of a finite number of ordinary particles in the presence of a single impurity , which can be mapped onto a hzrp , has a walk model interpretation . in this section",
    "we aim to show that the generalized hzrp introduced in the previous section has a simple equivalent walk model in a special case .",
    "note that if the particles hopping rates are constant and do not depend on the number of empty lattice sites in front of each particle , the model converges into the process introduced and discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ let us start with the definition of the disordered driven - diffusive system .",
    "we assume that the driven - diffusive system is defined on a ring of length @xmath0 and consists of two different types of particles .",
    "there is one second - class particle ( let us consider it as the first particle ) which hops to its rightmost vacant neighboring lattice site with the rate @xmath34 provided that there are @xmath35 empty lattice sites in front of it .",
    "there are also @xmath1 first - class particles on the ring which are considered as @xmath36nd , @xmath37rd , @xmath38 and @xmath6th particles .",
    "each first - class particle hops to its rightmost vacant neighboring lattice site with the rate @xmath39 provided that there are @xmath35 empty lattice sites in front of it .",
    "a simple example is plotted in fig .",
    "[ graphics2 ] .",
    "we associate the operators @xmath17 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 to an empty lattice site , a first - class particle and a second - class particle respectively .",
    "these operators satisfy the algebra ( [ algebra2 ] ) for @xmath42 .",
    "their matrix representation is also given by ( [ rep1 ] ) in which @xmath43 for @xmath42 .",
    "it is much easier to work in a grand - canonical ensemble in which the number of first - class particles is controlled by a fugacity . according to the matrix product method",
    "discussed above and following @xcite the grand - canonical partition function of this system can be written as : @xmath44 in which @xmath45 .",
    "now one can rewrite ( [ gcpf1 ] ) using the matrix representation of @xmath41 given in ( [ rep1 ] ) as : @xmath46 in which we have used the fact that : @xmath47 note that @xmath48 on @xmath49 can be written as a linear superposition of @xmath50 . expanding ( [ gcpf2 ] ) as a power series in @xmath51 ,",
    "the canonical partition function of the generalized driven - diffusive system is equal to the coefficient of @xmath52 .",
    "+ this disordered driven - diffusive system can be mapped onto a hzrp consisting of @xmath6 boxes and @xmath5 similar particles .",
    "the boxes are divided into two different types .",
    "the rate at which a particle leaves the first box @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 while the rate at which a particle leaves the other boxes @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 .",
    "the mapping guaranties that the partition function of the disordered driven - diffusive system is equal to that of the hzrp .",
    "+ in @xcite it has been shown that a much simpler hzrp in which the particles leave the boxes at a constant rate can be mapped onto a two - dimensional walk model . in",
    "that which follows we will show that the hzrp defined above can also be mapped onto a walk model .     a disordered driven - diffusive system on a ring of length @xmath57 containing @xmath58 particles .",
    "the first particle ( white disk ) is considered as a second - class particle while the rest of the particles ( black disks ) are considered as first - class particles.,width=192 ]    one can see that the expression ( [ gcpf2 ] ) can be interpreted as the partition function of a simple random walk model if we consider @xmath59 as the transfer matrix of a two - dimensional random walk defined on the lattice sites of a two - dimensional plane @xmath60 . each step taken by the random walker has a weight . the random walker moves according to the following rules :    *   for @xmath61 from the lattice site @xmath62 to @xmath63 with a weight @xmath2 where @xmath64 .",
    "this is called an upward step . *   for @xmath61 from the lattice site @xmath62 to @xmath65 with a weight @xmath66 where @xmath64 .",
    "this is called a horizontal ( for @xmath67 ) or a downward ( for @xmath68 ) step .    keeping in mind that the random walker does not take any steps in the negative @xmath69-direction",
    ", we assume that it starts from the origin @xmath70 and takes @xmath3 consecutive steps according to the above mentioned rules .",
    "finally the random walker should be at the lattice site @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "we define the weight of a path of length @xmath3 as a product of the weights of the steps taken by the random walker times an extra weight associated with the destination point that is @xmath73 if the random walker s destination lattice site is @xmath71 .",
    "it is now easy to see why the transfer matrix of the walk model is exactly equal to @xmath59 defined in ( [ gcpf1 ] ) and ( [ rule ] ) .",
    "the partition function of the walk model is also given by ( [ gcpf2 ] ) .",
    "the disordered driven - diffusive system defined in previous section contains exactly @xmath6 particles . when we map this system onto a hzrp it contains @xmath6 boxes . as we saw",
    "the grand - canonical partition function of the disordered driven - diffusive system ( or equivalently the hzrp ) is equal to that of the walk model defined by the rules in previous section .",
    "it is easy to verify that if we are interested in the canonical partition function of the disordered driven - diffusive system , we need the sum of the weights of the paths which contain exactly @xmath5 upward steps or equivalently @xmath1 downward and horizontal steps . this is because each downward or horizontal step contains one @xmath51 in the weight of that step . in what follows",
    "we show how we can calculate the canonical partition function of the disordered driven - diffusive system .",
    "+ the expression ( [ gcpf2 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath74 in which we have defined @xmath75 .",
    "clearly we have @xmath76 . using the matrix representation ( [ rep1 ] )",
    "one finds that @xmath77 satisfies the following recursion relation : @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",

    "this can be achieved using ( [ gcpf3 ] ) and ( [ rrsolv ] ) and the result is :    @xmath83f_{1}(k_{m-2}-1)f_{2}(n - k_{0}-1).\\ ] ]    this is the canonical partition function of three different models which can be mapped onto each other ; a disordered driven - diffusive system , a hzrp and a two - dimensional walk model as described in previous sections .",
    "let us investigate two special cases studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in the first case we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( equivalently @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "using the fact that : @xmath88 in which @xmath89 is the usual binomial coefficient , it is easy to see that ( [ cpf1 ] ) results in : @xmath90 which is exactly the canonical partition function of the system studied in @xcite . in the second case introduced and studied in @xcite",
