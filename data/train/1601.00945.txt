    "1em    large quantity of relativistic runaway electrons is one of the most feared by - product of tokamak disruption , especially for large devices with higher total plasma current and higher poloidal magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "those highly relativistic electrons are the direct result of high toroidal inductive field during disruption , which in turn is the consequence of drastically arising bulk plasma resistivity as the thermal energy is mostly lost after thermal quench @xcite . if left unchecked , runaway electrons can multiply exponentially by coulomb - collision avalanche @xcite , and up to 70% of initial plasma current can be converted into relativistic runaway current , forming the so called  runaway current plateau `` @xcite . furthermore , the high energy electrons will keep being accelerated until effective radiation drag from synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung radiation finally balance the toroidal inductive field @xcite .",
    "this will result in a highly anisotropic relativistic electron beam with energy on the order of tens of mevs @xcite , as well as a ' ' bump on the tail \" kind of distribution function in the momentum - space @xcite .",
    "the evolution of runaway electrons in momentum - space has been under substantial investigation during past decades @xcite .",
    "however , the corresponding evolution in configuration space has not received due attention . during the aforementioned runaway current plateau",
    ", it is widely observed that there is a gradual inward drift of runaway current @xcite .",
    "this inward drift will ultimately result in the intersection between runaway electrons and the wall , causing tremendous damage to the first wall due to its localized way of energy deposition @xcite .",
    "the reason of this displacement is attributed to the force imbalance under externally generated vertical field @xcite , while the possible role played by the dynamic of relativistic electrons in a self - generated magnetic field has not been fully explored .",
    "similar horizontal drift of runaway orbit has been studied using test particle model @xcite .",
    "it is found that the balancing of canonical angular momentum budget will induce a trajectory drift to compensate any change in mechanical angular momentum , resulting in horizontal motion if runaways are accelerated or decelerated .",
    "this horizontal drift is directional , as opposed to the diffusion - like behavior of stochastic scattering @xcite .",
    "however , the result of ref . can not be directly applied to the aforementioned inward drift , due to the fact that the current during plateau phase is carried by runaway electrons themselves .",
    "thus its crucial for us to go beyond test particle model and consider the runaway orbit drift as an nonlinear process , so that any drift relative to the magnetic axis will result in further displacement of axis itself .    in this paper , the aforementioned inward drift is studied by considering the current carrying runaway electrons in an 2d equilibrium during runaway plateau phase .",
    "those runaways are being decelerated by effective radiation drag as the original inductive accelerating field is greatly reduced during plateau @xcite .",
    "it is found that the runaway current always move inward due to the balance between canonical angular momentum change and mechanical angular momentum input if their momentum is decreasing .",
    "it is also found that the eddy current and the vertical field are important in stabilizing this inward drift . in the absence of both",
    ", the runaways will not stop until it hit the first wall even for very small amount of momentum loss .",
    "a characteristic time scale is estimated by considering the synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung radiation drag , and the result is found to reasonably agree with experimental observations .",
    "this agreement indicates the inward drift motion we discuss here plays an important role in understanding runaway displacement during plateau phase .",
    "the rest of the paper will be arranged as follows . in section [ s :",
    "angularmomentum ] , the transit orbit of runaway electrons will be given by seeking its constant canonical angular momentum of runaways . in section [ s :",
    "orbitdrift ] , we consider the displacement of runaway current center for any variation of parallel momentum .",
    "the zeroth order drift of runaway current will be given as a function of runaway momentum change for both ideally conducting wall case and no wall case .",
    "further , a characteristic time scale of such drift will be estimated using effective radiation drag . in section [",
    "s : conclusion ] , a conclusion of the work will be given .",
    "1em    we consider a large aspect ratio toroidal system with major radius @xmath1 , while @xmath2 is defined as major radius corresponding to the geometry center of the poloidal cross section of the system . for simplicity , we consider the first wall to be a rectangle toroid elongated along z direction .",
    "let the short side of the rectangle be @xmath3 , while the long side of it be @xmath4 .",
    "the inverse aspect ratio @xmath5 is a small number .",
    "four walls of the toroid are designated by numbers respectively .    a schematic plot of the system of interest is shown in fig.[fig:1 ] along with two coordinate systems @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath2 does not necessarily correspond to the runaway current center . since we are primarily interested in the orbit drift of runaways , no velocity space instabilities will be discussed . also ,",
    "since the vertical stability of the runaway current is essentially a equilibrium problem which is a separate topic from what we are concerned here , it will not be treated in our consideration as well .    in the absence of radiation drag",
    ", we will obtain the transit orbit of runaway electrons by seeking its constant canonical angular momentum surface . an easy way to see how this is done",
    "is to realize that the parallel momentum @xmath8 is a near - constant across the transit orbit for runaway electrons , as the variation of perpendicular kinetic energy @xmath9 is of @xmath10 comparing to @xmath11 if we assume @xmath12 .",
    "thus the invariance of canonical angular momentum @xmath13 defines a 2d trajectory surface in configuration space for runaway electrons .",
    "a more rigorous consideration would write @xmath8 as a function of hamiltonian @xmath14 and configuration space coordinates @xmath15 , then we have @xmath16 .",
    "the invariance of @xmath14 and @xmath17 in time again defines the trajectory surface @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , due to the separation of time scale between the runaway electron s bounce time and their deceleration time , the trajectory within one bounce period can still be defined by the near - conservation of canonical angular momentum even when the radiation drag is included .    in our consideration , all of the runaways are assumed to be located on a torus with minor radius @xmath18 , and with a single energy and pitch angle . while this is certainly not realistic , it serves to demonstrate the most fundamental physical idea . in reality , the runaway electrons have a distribution both in configuration space and in velocity space , but the well known hollowed image of runaway radiation strongly suggest a hollowed spatial profile which peaks at certain minor radius @xcite , justifying our spatial assumption for the runaways as a zeroth order approximation .",
    "on the other hand , the single energy assumption is intended to mimic the `` bump on tail '' distribution of runaways in velocity space , as well as to greatly simplify the model .",
    "the effect of eddy current as a result of current center motion is taken into account by considering a simplified ideally conducting wall .",
    "this ideally conducting wall will stabilize current displacement , thus serving as a maximum stabilization scenario .",
    "in real tokamak , it s effect will be reduced by finite resistivity .    since assuming all the runaways are of the same energy and pitch angle , its sufficient for us to write down the lagrangian of a single runaway electron to describe dynamic of the whole runaway torus .",
    "we write down the relativistic guiding center lagrangian for runaways in the absence of radiation as follows @xcite , l(,,t ) = -mc^2 .here , @xmath19 is the charge of electron , @xmath20 is electron mass , @xmath21 is the speed of light , @xmath22 denotes the direction of magnetic field which is largely in toroidal direction due to the strong toroidal guide field .",
    "@xmath23 is the relativistic factor = .@xmath24 stand for the magnetic field , and the magnetic momentum is @xmath25 , while @xmath8 and @xmath26 are the momentum parallel and perpendicular to the field line , respectively .",
    "we now look at the contribution from vector potentials term by term , @xmath27 is the vector potential generated by the runaway current , @xmath28 is the vector potential corresponding to eddy current generated in a ideally conducting wall as a reaction to runaway current motion .",
    "thus @xmath29 describe the total vector potential of a runaway current loop surrounded by the first wall .",
    "apart form those contributions , @xmath30 corresponds to an additional toroidal electric field which is generated by external coil and has the following form , _",
    "ex(r ) = - , _ ex = e_ex0.we should point out that , since we are considering runaway electrons with high energy , the current carried by those electrons is just i_r = n_rec .here , @xmath31 is the total runaway population .",
    "hence we know that the kinetic energy change of those electrons will only have minimal impact on the current itself , so that the inductive electric field from the change of poloidal magnetic flux is negligible . in a more realistic consideration , the distribution of runaways in velocity space has to be considered , and there may be small inductive field exist due to low energy runaways slowing down thus reducing the runaway current",
    ". however , those inductive field would be much smaller than the toroidal field at the beginning of current quench due to the much slower current decay rate .",
    "last , there is an additional contribution @xmath32 representing the constant magnetic field imposed by external coils , which include a toroidal field along @xmath33 direction and a vertical field along @xmath34 direction _",
    "t + _ z , _ t = -,_z = b_z0.the vertical field here represents the externally applied position control field , which will keep the current at the center of the system at the beginning of our consideration .",
    "it serves as a simplified mimic of the horizontal position control field in a real tokamak , as it is constant in space and time , as opposed to the real field which varies in both .",
    "nonetheless , any gradual spatial variation or active position control can be treated as additional effects , while we are only concerned with the fundamental trend of runaway drift here . due to the form of those constant field",
    ", @xmath32 can be chosen to have the following form _",
    "c = r_0b_t0-+b_z0r.only the @xmath33 component of @xmath32 will contribute to the trajectory of runaway electrons .",
    "the constant @xmath35 is chosen so that at the beginning of the runaway plateau the runaway current center coincide with the geometry center of the system @xmath2 .",
    "now the vector potential contribution from the runaway current itself will be write down explicitly .",
    "we assume _ a priori _ that the radial variation of runaway orbit along @xmath36 direction is of @xmath37 , so that the poloidal cross - section of runaway orbit can be approximated as a circle .",
    "hence the magnetic field directly generated by the runaway current is axis - symmetric with regard to the runaway current center in the large aspect ratio limit .",
    "we will check the validity of this assumption _ a posteriori_. this yields the following simple contribution _",
    "= , _ r = - , k(x ) = 1 , ( x0 ) ; k(x ) = 0 , ( x<0 ) ; i(x ) = 1-k(x ) .here , @xmath38 is the minor radius of runaway electrons relative to the runaway current center .",
    "the step function @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the fact that there is no current within the runaway torus , thus the runaway current contribution to the poloidal field is zero within the torus , and the vector potential have a simple @xmath41 behavior .",
    "further , the response from the ideally conducting wall will be treated by simple magnetic image method .",
    "we treat the movement @xmath42 of runaway current @xmath43 effectively as adding a pair of new current , one at the original position of the current and with value @xmath44 which cancels the original current , the other at distance @xmath42 and with value @xmath43 which represents the moved current .",
    "the image currents corresponding to those two effective currents then represent the eddy current contribution to current center displacement . a schematic plot of this treatment is shown in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "this yields _ w = _",
    "w^(+ ) + _ w^(- ) , _",
    "w^(+ ) = ( + + + ) , _",
    "w^(- ) = - ( + + + ) .here , @xmath45 represents the distance between runaway and the positive and negative image current centers generated by corresponding wall as designated in fig.[fig:1 ] respectively . for leading order contribution",
    ", it would be well enough for us to just take the four pairs of `` primary '' image currents directly corresponds to the current center displacement",
    ".    finally , using above equations , eq .",
    "( ) can be rewritten as follows , l = p_r + p _",
    "-h , p_r = er_0b_0 -e , p_= er_0b_0r -e + ( p+ea_d)r , p_= r , h = mc^2 .here , @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 for a large aspect ratio torus , and it can be approximately seen as a constant . it can be seen from eq .",
    "( ) that there is no explicit dependence on @xmath33 in the lagrangian , so that the euler - lagrange equation yields = ( ) = p_= 0 .that is , the symmetry of the system demands the canonical angular momentum of runaway electron to be a invariant in time .",
    "this invariant will define the surface of runaway orbit in configuration space . in the presence of non - conservative forces such as radiation drag , the toroidal component of the modified euler - lagrange equation write @xcite ( ) - = q_.here",
    ", @xmath49 corresponds to the change of angular momentum caused by radiation drag .",

    ".here , @xmath51 is the total mechanical angular momentum change caused by radiation drag .",
    "it is averaged along the trajectory of runaway electrons , thus is only the function of time .    due to the symmetry along @xmath33 direction",
    ", this system is essentially 2d .",
    "it would be convenience for us to express the 2d poloidal plane in terms of cartesian coordinates for the purpose of studying runaway orbit projection in this plane .",
    "we choose @xmath52 to coincide with @xmath1 , and @xmath53 to coincide with @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath54 corresponds to @xmath55 , and @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath57 .",

    ", we will consider the displaced runaway orbit for changing parallel momentum as a sequence of stationary trajectory surfaces with time dependent terms dropped , each surface corresponds to a different parallel momentum and a different displacement .",
    "direct impression of runaway orbit drift with respect to a given change in parallel momentum can then be obtained by comparing the original runaway orbit at the beginning of plateau with the decelerated one , as shown in fig.[fig:3 ] and fig.[fig:4 ] respectively . here ,",
    "the runaway current @xmath43 acts as a given parameter and does not change in time .",
    "the radius of runaway torus is @xmath59 .",

    "the runaway electron parallel momentum is set to be @xmath61 , the constant vertical field is chosen as @xmath62 so that the runaway current center will be at @xmath2 . for runaway current on the order of @xmath63 ma , the aforementioned choice of parallel momentum corresponds to a relativistic factor @xmath64 .",
    "the inverse aspect ratio is chosen as @xmath65 .",

    "the sudden change in the field behavior within the runaway torus is due to the step functions in eq .",
    "( ) , and will not affect the runaway orbit in any way .",
    "then we consider the case when the runaways have decelerated due to radiation drag .",
    "the relativistic factor is now @xmath67 , the displacement is found by calculating the constant @xmath17 contour iteratively so that the geometric center of orbit matches the current center position @xmath68 .",

    "+ ( a ) +   + ( b )    the most important feature obtained from this comparison is that runaway electrons will drift inward as long as they are decelerating , which will contribute to the inward runaway current drift observed in runaway plateau regime .",
    "the detailed dynamic of this inward drift will be discussed in section [ s : orbitdrift ] . also , it can be seen that the deviation of runaway transit orbit from circle is less than @xmath69 comparing to @xmath18 , justifying our assumption that the runaway orbit cross - section can be approximated as a circle even with substantial displacement .",
    "1em    the runaway orbit for a given @xmath8 is demonstrated in section [ s : angularmomentum ] by iteratively seeking the constant @xmath17 surface .",
    "the explicit time dependence of this orbit is dropped .",

    "also , the runaway current drift and the total change in parallel momentum has a clean and simple linear relation , and the runaway electrons will drift inward as long as they are decelerating . this linear behavior derive from the fact that the prescribed vertical field is the dominant stabilizing term in the drift equation for no wall limit , rather than the wall current term which is dependent on the runaway current displacement .",
    "it can be further inferred that the runaways would hit the wall even for some small change in momentum on the order @xmath90 .",

    "the only difference is that guan et al .",
    "studied the outward drift of accelerating runaways in a constant poloidal field carried by plasma current , while here we are looking at the inward drift of decelerating runaways in a constant vertical field sustained by external coils .",
    "it is desirable for us to estimate the time scale of aforementioned horizontal drift caused by effective radiation drag .",

    "the resulting effective drag field is on the order of @xmath97 v / m .",

    ", we numerically integrate eq .",
    "( ) to show that such deformation actually have minimal impact on the over all shape of runaway cross - section until the runaways come really close to the wall .",
    "assuming the same initial runaway torus radius and a initial normalized parallel momentum @xmath120 ( which corresponds to @xmath121 in our case ) , the displacement of both the left and right extreme points of the runaway torus , as well as that of the current center is shown in fig.[fig:9 ] .",
    "it is apparent that the deformation of torus cross - section only becomes important when the current center is rather close to the wall ,    we can also estimate the time scale of horizontal drift in ideal wall limit by considering the deceleration caused by radiation drag . once again",
    ", we have , @xmath93 , and the effective radiation drag can still be estimated as on the order of @xmath97 v / m . at the same time , when the runaway torus is not so close to the war , the drift rate @xmath122 , hence the characteristic time scale of horizontal drift is @xmath123s .",
    "this time scale reasonably agree with experimental observation , where the current center moves one third of the minor radius in @xmath124ms @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a time scale about @xmath125s .",
    "it should be noted that the estimation here is made by using the radiative drag experienced by @xmath121 runaways , as the runaway decelerate , the drift velocity is expected to be slower , hence the actual time for runaways to hit the wall may be somewhat longer than estimated here .",
    "1em    the inward drift of runaway current center during runaway plateau is studied in this paper .",
    "this horizontal drift motion is required by the balance between change in canonical angular momentum and the mechanical angular momentum change caused by radiation drag .",
    "we are mainly interested in the plateau regime after disruption where most of the current is carried by runaway electrons themselves . in this consideration , for any drift of runaway electron relative to the field line",
    ", the current center itself will also drift . since the magnetic field lines",
    "is generated by this runaway current , the resulting current center drift motion is essentially non - linear , as opposed to the linear drift motion of test particle runaways studied in previous works @xcite .",
    "the runaway transit orbit surface is obtained by seeking the constant canonical angular momentum surface in a unperturbed 2d equilibrium .",
    "it is found that runaways will always drift inward as long as they are losing momentum .",
    "the eddy current and external vertical field are found to play a crucial role in stabilizing this horizontal drift , without which the runaways will not stop until they hit the first wall even for small amount of momentum loss .",
    "the dynamic of this inward drift is analyzed by taking the variation of canonical angular momentum and electron energy , which yield a first order ode describing the trajectory displacement for any given change in parallel momentum .",
    "the remarkable feature of this drift motion is that is does not really depends on the detailed history of deceleration , only on how much momentum is lost in total .",
    "the time scale of such displacement is estimated by using models of effective radiation drag .",
    "the time scale thus calculated reasonably agrees with experimental observation .",
    "it is noteworthy that the horizontal drift we discussed here has drastically different physics with the force imbalance along major radius , which has been invoked when discussing the observed inward motion during plateau regime @xcite .",
    "the fundamental physics here is the balance in canonical angular momentum budget , which can not be recovered by simply considering the runaway current as an ordinary current carrying circuit .",
    "an easy way to see this is by considering a runaway torus in perfect force balance .",
    "we then consider a certain loss of parallel momentum , with minimal decrease in the velocity of runaways .",
    "the change in @xmath126 force balance is negligible , so that if we only consider the runaway current as an ordinary circuit with finite mass , the previously force balanced current will still be in equilibrium along major radial direction , thus it should not move at all .",
    "however , as we have seen in lagrangian mechanics analysis , the runaways will actually drift inward in response to the change in mechanical angular momentum .",
    "hence our study here provided a new powerful mechanism which may play an important role in analyzing runaway motions during plateau regime .",
    "strong simplification has been made to ensure the runaway current drift we concerned here to be analytically tractable . in a more realistic consideration , various more complicated model such as finite distribution of runaways in phase space and the impact of finite resistive wall should be included .",
    "most importantly , the runaway beam with finite spatial distribution along minor radius could be of great interest , as the interaction between different `` rings '' of runaway torus may produce more complicated picture than that is studied here .",
    "nonetheless , our simplified model has captured the most basic and fundamental trend for runaway trajectory behavior , namely the inward drift trend for decelerating runaways . tracking the evolution of aforementioned more complicated model require numerical tools , and it is left for future works .",
