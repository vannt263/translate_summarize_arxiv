    "the non - extensive generalization of the standard boltzmann - gibbs  statistics was proposed in 1988 by c. tsallis[1 - 4 ] .",
    "this non - extensive generalization begins with the supposition of a new , fractal inspired entropy s@xmath0 where q is any real number and k is a positive constant which becomes boltzmann constant in the limit q@xmath1 . in this case , the new entropy s@xmath2 takes the form -k@xmath3 , which is simply the standard entropy formula.this new non - extensive statistics has been studied a great deal to list its properties and it is also applied to many well - known examples of the boltzmann - gibbs statistics such as ehrenfest theorem[5 ] , fokker- planck equations[6 ] and quantum statistics[7 ] .",
