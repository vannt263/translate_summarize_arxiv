    "graph theory is regarded as having begun with euler s solution to the knigsberg bridge problem in @xmath7 ; euler was possibly the most prolific mathematician of all time  @xcite , ( though both paul erds and serge lang may stake a claim to this description ) .",
    "the historical development of infinite discrete mathematics was such that  @xcite it took another two centuries until erds and a. rnyi published the unique defining relation for the infinite graph .",
    "their papers beginning in @xmath8 built upon the notion discovered by erds in the @xmath9s but that had lay dormant for a while , by giving a non - constructive existence proof of what became known as the random graph which we denote @xmath1 , and by proving its uniqueness .",
    "the binomial model of the random graph due to e. n. gilbert also dates back to @xmath8 .",
    "anatol rapoport began a study of random - biased nets in  @xcite , in which the emergence of a giant cluster in a certain limit is derived , though the derivation is heuristic .",
    "rapoport introduced _ biases _ to provide more realistic models than can be achieved by using pure randomness .",
    "the theory is summarized in  @xcite .",
    "more on the origins of random graph theory can be found in  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on studying versions of the random graph with more than two adjacency types , which for clarity we denote by colours .",
    "we have devoted much attention to the countably infinite graph with three adjacency types , calling it the _ triality graph _ , denoting it @xmath6 and using the symbols @xmath10 for its red , blue and green edges .",
    "many of our results apply more generally to multicoloured generalizations of @xmath1 having any finite or infinite number of edge - colours .",
    "a simple graph is a relational structure with one binary symmetric irreflexive relation .",
    "one feature which persists in the transition from simple graphs with edges and non - edges to graphs on any number of colours is the existence of a structure that is countable , universal ( that is contains all finite substructures ) and homogeneous ( that is for which any isomorphism between finite substructures extends to an automorphism of the entire structure )  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "let us say a little about these two properties .",
    "firstly universality .",
    "two examples of _ categories _ , that is structures and accompanying natural maps , leading to familiar universal objects are the collection of countable linear orders and order - preserving maps having the linear order of rationals as universal object , and countable boolean algebras together with boolean algebra isomorphisms that have the countable boolean algebra on countably many generators as universal .",
    "the universal objects may be of interest in their own right .",
    "one aim of studying a universal structure is the possibility of finding a unifying theme for the individual questions of interest as well as the chance that the universal object may have properties that influence those of the embedded substructures as well as being influenced by them .",
    "so in addition to the properties of the universal object itself , we may gather information that is useful in classifying the finite sub - objects .",
    "for the two examples just mentioned proof of universality gives us the theory of dense linear orders without endpoints and the result that a finitely generated subalgebra of a boolean algebra is finite .",
    "universal objects are seldom unique , because adding one point results in a different universal object , but universal homogeneous objects are unique .",
    "there are certainly instances where universal objects fail to exist , for example for the category of countable fields and mappings preserving 0 , 1 , and the field operations . in graph theory",
    ", there is no countable planar graph which is universal with respect to one - to - one graph homomorphisms , nor is there a universal graph of fixed finite degree under _ weak embeddings _",
    ", this being a @xmath2@xmath2 mapping @xmath11 from the vertices of graph @xmath12 to the vertices of graph @xmath13 such that if @xmath14 are neighbours in @xmath12 then they are also neighbours in @xmath13 .",
    "the paper by moss  @xcite contains more on the existence and nonexistence of universal graphs .",
    "a variation on this theme is the idea of _ homomorphism - universal _ structures whose relationship with embedding - universal structures is given in  @xcite .",
    "briefly , if a homomorphism is @xmath2@xmath2 then it is an embedding .",
    "another example of a phenomenon where a global structure provides a description of the possible local structures of graphs is that of _ limit graph _",
    "@xcite ; see appendix  [ permutationgroups ] .    next homogeneity . to say that a structure is homogeneous is equivalent to asserting that it has the maximum amount of symmetry ; or that many parts of the structure look alike ; or that the structure looks the same when viewed from many positions within the structure .",
    "we have mentioned the uniqueness of the countable random graph ; it also has a huge amount of symmetry . to see how remarkable and unexpected this is , contrast the situation with the finite case .",
    "construct a finite random graph on @xmath15 vertices by ordering the pairs of vertices in a countable sequence , and tossing a fair coin a total of @xmath16 times where heads means join the two vertices by an edge , and tails means do nothing . every @xmath15-vertex graph ( up to isomorphism )",
    "occurs with non - zero probability , and the probability of a particular graph arising is inversely proportional to its symmetry as measured by the order of its automorphism group .",
    "the asymmetric graphs are overwhelmingly more numerous than the symmetric ones .",
    "the probability measure associated with a countable sequence of coin tosses is discussed in appendix  [ categoryandmeasure ] . to get a feel for the meaning of homogeneity beyond its definition consider that the pentagon or 5-cycle graph is homogeneous , but that the hexagon or 6-cycle graph is not because a pair of points two steps apart and a pair three steps apart are isomorphic as induced subgraphs but are not equivalent under automorphisms of the whole graph .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of homogeneous universal structures follow immediately from frass s theorem  @xcite on relational structures . as we stated , homogenous structures are those with the maximum amount of symmetry and one of the most useful methods for constructing objects with a large amount of symmetry is based on this theorem . in the two - colour case , thinking of a two - coloured complete graph as a simple graph , the appropriate structure is _",
    "rado s graph _ , or the erds - rnyi _ random graph _  @xcite @xmath1 ; it was richard rado  @xcite who gave the first construction of @xmath1 .",
    "frass s theory has been extended in several directions .",
    "for example , a study of relational structures which satisfy the analogue of homogeneity but for homomorphisms rather than isomorphisms was begun in  @xcite .",
    "we include some material on some of the developments in an appendix on frass s theory of relational structures .",
    "multi - adjacency random graphs have been analysed before , as countable universal homogeneous @xmath17-coloured graphs @xmath18 for @xmath19 , using permutation group theory  @xcite  @xcite . in another appendix",
    "we prcis some of the results from previous research work .",
    "the random graph is unique up to isomorphism and random graphs with different numbers of colours will be pairwise non - isomorphic . allowing colours on vertices yields different graphs and in chapter 2 we comment briefly on random graphs with two - coloured vertices .",
    "much of the impetus for the renaissance of discrete mathematics beginning in the second half of last century has been finite or finitary in origin and often guided by real - world problems .",
    "this does not diminish the contribution of questions that are infinite in their nature .",
    "an apposite quote is the first sentence of the relevant chapter in the book  @xcite : `` although the theory of random graphs is one of the youngest branches of graph theory , in importance it is second to none . ''",
    "the two - coloured random graph has been studied using combinatorial  @xcite , probabilistic  @xcite , logical  @xcite and spectral techniques .",
    "the study of random graphs on any number of colours greater than two adds further scope to the field .",
    "most of the work in random graph theory so far has blended probability theory , combinatorics and logic , but our focus has been on graph constructions and group actions on the graphs .",
    "a group action can uncover some of the detailed structure and properties of an operand by seeing what actions it supports , and at the same time it can illuminate the characteristics of the acting group by giving some of its representations .",
    "this is particularly the case if a mathematical object can be uniquely determined by the algebra of functions that it can support .    in studying the infinite counterpart of a finite structure ,",
    "it is natural to let one of the parameters go to infinity .",
    "this    taking the infinite limit of a parameter of in a finite structure can not be done arbitrarily ; in discrete mathematics it may cause axiom of choice problems and in continuous mathematics , convergence issues may arise .",
    "another reason is that certain properties may be lost in taking the limit .",
    "for example , the linear group @xmath20 acting on the countably infinite vector space @xmath21 over a finite field @xmath22 is _ oligomorphic _ ( meaning that the number of @xmath20 orbits on the set of @xmath15-subsets of @xmath21 is finite for all @xmath15 ) ; the field must be finite , because fixing a vector fixes all scalar multiples of it , but an infinite field gives an infinite number of scalar multiples , contradicting oligomorphicity .",
    "however oligomorphicity is _ not _ lost when the dimension of the space goes from finite to infinite .",
    "in fact if @xmath22 is finite then @xmath21 is totally categorical ( these are the best behaved of the four classes in the categoricity spectrum implied by morley s theorem in _ model theory _ ) , whilst it is uncountably categorical if @xmath22 is countably infinite .",
    "( a set of sentences in a model is _ categorical in power _ @xmath23 ( an infinite cardinal ) if any two models of the set of cardinality @xmath23 are isomorphic . )",
    "morley showed that a set of sentences over a countable language which is categorical in some uncountable power is categorical in all ; shelah extended the notion from first - order to infinitary logic , where the compactness theorem fails  @xcite .",
    "these are all notions from logic and in particular model theory , and we defer discussions these concepts to the appendices .    the word _ oligomorphic _ is intended to capture the notion of ` few shapes ' , where the group orbits contain a finite number of structures of any given finite size ( that is , few ) and each orbit contains an isomorphism class of structures ( that is , shapes ) .",
    "one systematic way to go from the finite to the infinite is using the model theory of relational structures developed by roland frass  @xcite .",
    "this theory is widely - applicable to many different types of structures , but frass s main interest was in relational ones .",
    "if @xmath24 is a finite substructure of any homogeneous structure @xmath25 , then all automorphisms of @xmath24 extend to automorphisms of @xmath25 fixing @xmath24 .",
    "if the converse holds then @xmath24 is said to be a _",
    "finite homogeneous substructure _ of @xmath25 . rose and woodrow use the term _ ultrahomogeneous structures _ if every isomorphism between substructures of a smaller cardinality extends to an automorphism . in",
    "@xcite they prove a sufficient condition for their existence as well as others on connections between such structures and _ quantifier elimination ( q.e . ) _ which defined in the appendix on model theory .",
    "model theory is a part of pure mathematics which is very general in its notions and formalism , and simultaneously very good at solving problems when specialised .",
    "its methods are increasingly being used to great eefect in other areas of mathematics .",
    "the proofs of theorems of gdel - deligne , chevalley - tarski , ax - grothendieck , tarski - seidenberg , and weil - hrushovski which were an intersection of model - theoretic methods and techniques from other areas ; see reference  @xcite .",
    "other crossovers can be found in the work of ax - kochen - ershov , macintyre , denef and du sautoy .",
    "the important point is that such techniques were used before or instead of the usual methods of say field theory or algebraic geometry .",
    "there is a claim that algebraic geometry is in some sense a canonical special case of model theory , for while not everything can be reduced to algebraic geometry , the classical functions and the structures they give rise to are nice extensions of it .",
    "so there may be a generalization or a re - writing of deep parts of mathematics , for instance the geometric langlands programme using model - theoretic language .",
    "the tools we use are largely group - theoretic , many of the ideas such as reducts and the small index property , are at heart model - theoretic . a comprehensive treatment of the field can be found in  @xcite .    in zermelo - fraenkel set theory , @xmath26 , _",
    "@xmath27-categoricity _ of @xmath1 means that there is essentially only one countable model of set theory with symmetrised set - inclusion @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath27-categoricity is a property of the automorphism group of a structure and implies a very high degree of symmetry .",
    "homogeneity is an even stronger condition .",
    "relational structures with large automorphism groups have a high degree of symmetry ; this is also implied by an orbit space with a small number of orbits of the acting automorphism group . a countable homogeneous relational structure of a given type",
    "is determined up to isomorphism by the isomorphism classes of its finite substructures .",
    "an important outcome of frass s theorem is that determining the numbers of orbits on @xmath15-sets or @xmath15-tuples of _ oligomorphic _ permutation groups ( those having finitely many orbits in their induced action on @xmath15-tuples for all @xmath15 ) is equivalent to enumerating the unlabelled or labelled objects in certain classes of finite structures characterized largely by the _",
    "amalgamation property _ , which is a way of building larger structures from smaller ones ( see appendix  [ theoryofrelationalstructures ] ) .",
    "not all graph classes amalgamate ; for example , @xmath15-colourable graphs ( those having chromatic number at most @xmath15 ) do not have the amalgamation property .",
    "the model - theoretic equivalent of the concept of oligomorphic permutation group is given by the engeler  ryll - nardzewski  svenonius theorem  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite which states that a countable ( first - order ) structure is axiomatisable ( that is characterised up to isomorphism as a countable structure by first - order sentences ) if and only if its automorphism group is oligomorphic .",
    "the surprising conclusion of this theorem is that _ axiomatisability is equivalent to symmetry_. this result appears to be an _",
    "exception_. we know of no other such equivalences in model theory ; it does not apply to higher cardinalities .",
    "remarkable though the theorem is , it adds nothing to our knowledge of finite structures , for every finite permutation group is oligomorphic , and every finite first - order structure is categorical .",
    "indeed , if the automorphism group of the @xmath15-element structure @xmath25 has a base of size @xmath29 , then every point of @xmath25 is uniquely identified by a formula having the elements of the base as parameters .",
    "( if @xmath30 is a permutation group on a set @xmath31 , a @xmath32 for @xmath30 is a list @xmath33 of elements of @xmath31 whose pointwise stabilizer in @xmath30 is the identity .",
    "one philosophy is that a list of points of the structure @xmath25 which is a base for the automorphism group of @xmath25 should be in some sense a base for @xmath25 ; this holds for first - order structures .",
    "that is , if we can not move @xmath34 to @xmath35 by an automorphism fixing @xmath33 pointwise , this is because the structures of @xmath36)$ ] and @xmath37)$ ] are different . for more on bases ,",
    "see  @xcite and  @xcite . )",
    "the occurrence of the random graph paradigm in various areas of mathematics is well - known  @xcite , and perhaps less famously in models in physics , see for example  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "what is typically being asked for is the form of ` most ' graphs in families with certain properties .",
    "this is the essence of the so - called probabilistic method  @xcite .",
    "the underlying principle of random graph theory can in a heuristic way be considered to be diametrically opposite to the principle underlying chaos theory , where neighbouring trajectories diverge exponentially for long - term behaviour , that is on an attractor .",
    "the random graph construction has been extended to more general first - order relational structures  @xcite .",
    "it can also be viewed as a special case of the borel - cantelli lemmas concerning infinite sequences of trials , for example bernoulli trials  @xcite ; see appendix  [ categoryandmeasure ] . that such constructions can arise both via borel - cantelli or from a kolmogorov zero - one law",
    ", points to the significance of probability in proofs of existence , uniqueness as well as in building mathematical structures .",
    "in fact it can be shown  @xcite that if a class of countable relational structures contains an infinite @xmath27-categorical universal homogeneous structure @xmath25 , then @xmath25 can be constructed probabilistically . a wide range of systems that arise as complex networks",
    "have been realized as random graphs  @xcite .",
    "many random graph properties have no unique vertex - independent threshold , but rather one that depends on the system size , with critical probability obeying @xmath38 .",
    "we can think of a random graph _",
    "evolution _ or _ emergence _ as the graph develops from a starting set of isolated vertices by the addition of random edges , that is as a changing dynamical network . the alternative passive approach , to which we have tacitly adhered , is to view random graphs as a family of graphs to which is added a probability distribution , thus turning it into a probability space .",
    "as the graphs grow they can undergo a phase transition which for example leads from small components to a giant component  @xcite .",
    "threshold phenomena are neither peculiar to a particular definition of randomness nor to graphs , occurring in a variety of random combinatorial structures in the limit of large size .",
    "the existence of a limit as the number of parts or interacting units in the system becomes very large is however crucial to the possibility of a sudden change in a certain property as a function of smooth changes of a parameter  @xcite . whilst our theory is not an application of threshold effects",
    ", we do also utilize the idea of the large system limit , as we will see .",
    "random graph theory offers the opportunity to work along both the finite - infinite and the discrete - continuous boundaries of mathematics .",
    "examples of this symbiosis abound , for example the exciting work on ` continuous graphs '  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "after concepts such as function and space , the concept of _ group _ is one of the most ubiquitous ideas in mathematics and permeates almost all branches , often in a fundamental way .",
    "we have concentrated our efforts on studying the types of groups whose action is supported by random graphs , including the random graph _ reducts _ ( or closed supergroups of the automorphism groups ) and their multicoloured variants , which we felt was a good starting point from which to uncover symmetry properties of the graphs .",
    "closure as the automorphism group of some first - order structure is equivalent to closure in the topology of pointwise convergence  @xcite .",
    "switching of undirected graphs was introduced by van lint and seidel  @xcite in their study of a problem concerning equilateral @xmath15-tuples of points in elliptic geometry .    according to a theorem of simon thomas  @xcite",
    "the group of switching automorphisms of @xmath1 is one of its three non - trivial reducts , a fact that can be explained by use of the _ two - graph _",
    "@xmath39 , a relational structure derived from @xmath1 whose automorphism group is @xmath40 , the group of switching automorphisms .",
    "the extra scope gained by consideration of more than two adjacencies offers new possibilities . in the three - coloured case",
    "the equivalent group of switching automorphisms is not a reduct , for it is highly transitive but not the symmetric group ; a group is _ highly transitive _ if it acts on an infinite set and is @xmath29-transitive , meaning that it maps any @xmath29-tuple to any other @xmath29-tuple for all integers @xmath41 .",
    "however there are switching automorphism reducts for multicoloured random graphs , which together with duality - type reducts are classified in the ph.d .",
    "thesis of james h. bennett  @xcite .",
    "some of the new results provide evidence that the random two - coloured graph has different switching properties to the random graph on three or more colours ; broadly , the former has structure which appears to be diluted when more than two colours are considered .",
    "so the random graph @xmath1 appears to have contrasting symmetry properties to those of the higher - adjacency graphs , as witnessed in the results of several of the chapters .",
    "this phenomenon where the low dimensional cases of a theory are seen to exhibit special behaviour which is lost in higher dimensions arises all over mathematics .",
    "we tabulate some of the differences between the two - colour and @xmath3-colour @xmath42 properties in an appendix",
    ". it would be worth investigating whether or not this difference extends to a loss of the ` strange logic '  @xcite that arises for @xmath1 , in particular the phase transition in @xmath1 whereby over a short range , events quickly turn from being almost certainly false to almost certainly true .",
    "j. k. truss has studied countable universal edge - coloured graphs , and we list some of his results , leaving a more complete summary for appendix  [ previousresults ] . in  @xcite he proved that these graphs have simple automorphism groups .",
    "more concretely a certain subset @xmath43 of elements of these groups is defined such that : ( a ) if @xmath44 then there is a conjugate @xmath45 of @xmath46 such that @xmath47 , ( b ) if @xmath48 there are conjugates @xmath49 of @xmath50 respectively such that @xmath51 . from ( a ) and ( b )",
    "it follows that if @xmath52,@xmath45 @xmath53 , then @xmath45 is the product of five conjugates of @xmath52 .",
    "the result is proved by approximating the desired conjugacies by means of carefully chosen finite approximations .",
    "the cycle types of elements of the automorphism groups @xmath54 are also classified .",
    "elements with cycle types @xmath55 and @xmath56 for prime @xmath57 are classified up to conjugacy .",
    "finally a study is made of the relations between the groups @xmath54 , for different @xmath3 .",
    "truss looked at the highly transitive overgroup of @xmath54 , the _ group of almost automorphisms _ @xmath58 of @xmath59 , in  @xcite .",
    "a permutation of @xmath59 is said to be an almost automorphism if the set of edges whose colour it alters is finite .",
    "he proved that @xmath58 is not simple , described its normal subgroups and characterized the possible cycle types of members of @xmath58 .    in the main text we will study and in part extend the above - mentioned properties of the random graph to its edge - coloured relatives .",
    "this book is part research monograph , part introduction to and summary of ground already covered over decades written with the intention of drawing in audiences from elsewhere including beginning researchers .",
    "the style of writing is intended to convey that multicoloured random graphs are a peg onto which to hang a great breadth of material . multicoloured random graphs do have distinguishable properties from the simple random graph , as listed in the table in figure 2 of appendix e , and this book is just the beginning .",
    "we have pointed out those issues where the two - coloured random graph illustrates the property under discussion .",
    "the contents of this tractate are arranged as follows . in order to maintain the flow of the main chapters , we defer to the appendices an introduction to the objects of study and elements of the theories which we apply in the main text .",
    "chapter @xmath2 introduces the triality graph @xmath6 and proves using standard arguments some fundamental properties such as homogeneity , universality , and the pigeonhole property .",
    "we end with some comments regarding triality graphs on vertices with two colours .    in @xmath60 of chapter @xmath61",
    "we define _ switching groups _",
    "@xmath62 that act on the set of complete graphs with @xmath15 vertices and @xmath3 different adjacencies , as well as groups of switching automorphisms and identify the interrelationship of these two types of groups . in the next two sections we define two - coloured switching , firstly for finite graphs and then for the infinite random graph @xmath1 stating thomas theorem that classifies its reducts .",
    "after a section which lists the reducts of the triality graph , we turn our attention to random graphs with coloured vertices , commenting on ( but not giving ) a classification of the reducts of the _ random bipartite graph _ @xmath63 . after a section outlining some of the known results on random graphs with forbidden substructures , we give a detailed examination of the switching group @xmath64 , as motivation for the determination in theorem  [ swgpfm ] of the structure of the finite switching groups @xmath62 .",
    "one section is devoted to the switching reduct for three colours .",
    "we go on to study some of the properties of @xmath65 , thereby extending the work of d. g. higman and j. j. seidel for @xmath66 .",
    "we prove in theorem  [ extswgp ] that for @xmath5 the extended groups  [ extsw ] defined by @xmath67 generated by the switchings and vertex permutations are primitive in their action on the set of complete graphs with @xmath15 vertices and @xmath3 edge colours , whilst for @xmath66 these extended groups are not even transitive in their action . for any coloured graph @xmath68",
    "the group @xmath69 of switching automorphisms is the stabilizer of @xmath68 in @xmath70 , or equivalently the group of permutations @xmath71 such that @xmath72 for some switching @xmath52 .",
    "we also show , in theorem  [ wte ] , for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and for a given @xmath15 , that @xmath62 is a weak transitive extension of @xmath75 . in the case of a graph with a countably infinite vertex set and a finite number of colours on edges ,",
    "we show that its group of switching automorphisms is the symmetric group on the vertex set if and only if the graph is a so - called _ switched c - clique _ for some colour @xmath76 , where this latter concept is defined .",
    "different definitions of switched @xmath76-clique are given and the equivalence of these definitions is proved .    in chapter",

    "we investigate switching groups that are closed in a certain topology , identifying the parity structure which the group elements preserve .",
    "this turns out to be different to the global parity - equivalence of graphs arising in chapter @xmath61 .",
    "we end by showing the circumstances in which switching groups can form a direct limit .",
    "chapters @xmath61 and @xmath77 offer evidence that the theory of switching groups has developed somewhat from seidel s original definition .",
    "in the first section of chapter @xmath78 we outline the theory of _ local switching _  @xcite together with elements of the cohomological theory of switching classes and two - graphs . in the next section",
    "we begin a formulation of the theory for multicoloured graphs , which involves working with a set of complete multicoloured graphs with a list of edge - colours , which we call an _ sml graph_. we generalize the relevant closed switching group from the previous section together with the parity that it leaves invariant . after a subsection outlining some known material on trees , we derive in two appendices two presentations for the switching group @xmath62 .",
    "_ we should mention that there are 3 types of colour parities appearing in our work .",
    "firstly that in chapter  [ chap2 ] ( in the prelude to theorem  [ psequiv ] ) , which is defined on @xmath77-coloured complete graphs , where one of the colours is stabilized and the parity refers to that of the number of second - colour edges in triangles ( vertex triples ) on the second and third colours .",
    "secondly , in chapter  [ chap3 ] ( in the prelude to theorem  [ parthm ] ) , refers to a parity - presercing permutation of a list of colours on triangles in a complete @xmath3-coloured graph .",
    "thirdly , in chapter  [ chap4 ] ( in the prelude to lemma  [ treeprop ] ) there is also a permutation parity of list colourings on edges of multicoloured graphs , but one which generalizes the second parity in being applicable in a slightly more general graph setting . _",
    "chapter @xmath79 has two parts .",
    "the first deals with polynomial algebras and polynomial invariants related to random graphs .",
    "we reveal how the algebras related to the two - coloured random graph reducts differ in their structure to those related to random graphs with more colours .",
    "the second half of the chapter is devoted to the elucidation of an isomorphism between two algebras that have quite different structures , explaining why the isomorphism works for the very simplest infinite version of the algebras for pure point sets , whilst it fails for finite algebras .",
    "we comment on the inexhaustibility of relational structures and on links between growth rates and reconstruction . in the appendix , we begin showing the isomorphism in the case of 1 , 2 and @xmath77-vertex graphs .    in chapter @xmath80 various aspects of random graphs as cayley graphs are examined .",
    "firstly , we use the construction of @xmath1 as a cayley graph to derive results concerning cyclic automorphisms and cyclic almost automorphisms of @xmath1 .",
    "square root sets of elements of a structure such as a group are defined and a necessary and sufficient condition for a group @xmath30 to act regularly on @xmath1 is given , this being a translation of the one - point extension property , one of the equivalent ways of defining random graphs .",
    "we then construct @xmath6 as a homogeneous cayley graph for both an index @xmath77 subgroup of the modular group in theorem  [ mdgptm ] and the complex leech lattice in theorem  [ cplltm ] .",
    "more generally we construct random cayley @xmath3-coloured graphs from lattices @xmath81 in @xmath82 , for @xmath83 , identifying lattice vectors with vertices and vector pairs with edges such that the graphs are invariant under the lattice automorphism group @xmath84 .",
    "this is quite different to known links between groups , graphs and lattices , such as the cayley graph for the free abelian group on two generators being a lattice in the plane with vertex set @xmath85 , because here the graphs are random .    after a section defining",
    "so - called _ groups with triality _ we prove the existence of such a subgroup of @xmath86 , and further prove that @xmath86 has a split extension .",

    "we will derive the group generated by these @xmath96 involutions .",
    "firstly note that five of the nine entries in this matrix are redundant as generators .",
    "later , we will consider the @xmath77-set embedded in an @xmath15-vertex graph ; but for now , the three vertices of the @xmath77-set are considered as comprising the whole graph .",

    "it is found that the sylow @xmath61-subgroups of @xmath30 are not normal subgroups and so not unique , whilst @xmath568 has a normal and therefore unique sylow @xmath77-subgroup .",
    "also @xmath568 is not nilpotent which implies that the the sylow @xmath61-subgroup acts non - trivially on the sylow @xmath77-subgroup because in a finite group if the sylow subgroups commute then the group is nilpotent .    that the orbit of @xmath568 has @xmath555 elements indicates a transitive group action on these @xmath555 graphs , all of which lie in a single equivalence class . in other words ,",
    "starting from any of the graphs , we can sequentially switch to get any of the other @xmath569 .",

    "<S> multicoloured random graphs : constructions and symmetry    this is a research monograph on constructions of , and group actions on countable homogeneous graphs , concentrating particularly on the simple random graph and its edge - coloured variants . taking this family of graphs as our starting point </S>",
    "<S> , we study various aspects of the graphs , but the emphasis has been on illuminating those groups that are supported by these graphs , together with links with other structures such as lattices , topologies @xmath0 filters , rings @xmath0 algebras , metric spaces , sets @xmath0 models , moufang loops and monoids . all graphs that we consider have a countable number of vertices , but some of the associated groups have uncountable order . </S>",
    "<S> the large amount of background material included serves as an introduction to the theories that are used to produce the new results . </S>",
    "<S> the large number of references should help in making this a resource for anyone interested in beginning research in this or allied fields . </S>",
    "<S> our exposition is intended to be thorough rather than encyclopedic .    </S>",
    "<S> the countably infinite random graph which we denote by @xmath1 is known to be unique up to isomorphism ; in other words a countable random graph is isomorphic to @xmath1 with probability @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> its most common variant is as a simple graph , thus having only two possible adjacencies , edges and non - edges , no loops or multiple edges being permitted . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see there are three equivalent ways of characterizing @xmath1 up to isomorphism as a countable graph , these being the so - called one - point extension property , the injection property or a combination of universality and homogeneity .    </S>",
    "<S> there is an obvious generalization to graphs with any finite or infinite number of different adjacency types , which we realize as colours . </S>",
    "<S> our study of these generalized graphs demonstrates that whilst the basic properties such as homogeneity , universality and various stability conditions remain the same as those of @xmath1 , the infinite - vertex @xmath3-coloured random graphs @xmath4 for @xmath5 support groups with a different structure and are associated with rings of a different structure , to those of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> some of these differences are highlighted . </S>",
    "<S> we also devote some attention to uncovering properties that are unique to the graph with three adjacency types which we call the _ triality graph _ denoting it @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> much of the work on the random graph and its relations over the past half - century has been on combinatorial aspects of the theory , whilst our exposition focuses on complementary questions . </S>"
