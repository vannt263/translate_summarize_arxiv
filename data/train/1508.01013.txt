    "the oxidation and corrosion of metals affects many areas of industry , technology , and everyday life .",
    "indeed , it plays a critical role in the failure of metal parts in engineering , electrochemical and catalytic devices , as well as of metal construction parts such as piping and roofing , to name but a few .",
    "the atomistic details of the processes of metal corrosion are still unclear , however an effective solution to the problem of corrosion has been found in the use of organic molecules as corrosion inhibitors , which work by interacting with metal / oxide surfaces and forming a protective film  @xcite .",
    "widely - used organic corrosion inhibition systems , whose effectiveness has been empirically verified , are amines or zinc dithiophosphates on steel and benzotriazole ( btah  @xcite ) on copper . however , the chemical details of the inhibiting action and the structure of the protective layer these molecules form against metal surfaces are still unresolved . in this work ,",
    "state - of - the - art computational methods are applied to the btah / cu copper system , which is the most studied both experimentally  @xcite and computationally  @xcite .",
    "the aim is to identify the structures btah forms on the copper surface and obtain insights into how they affect its function as a corrosion inhibitor .",
    "most experimental studies on organic corrosion inhibitors are macroscopic studies involving the immersion of a metal specimen in a solution containing corrosive agents and organic inhibitors .",
    "information about inhibition can be gathered during sample immersion , monitoring the evolution of the material using electrochemical or spectroscopic techniques ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) or after immersion , by measuring the mass change of the specimen or the amount of metal solvated in the solution ( see _ e.g. _ ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "these studies reveal insight into the effectiveness of different chemicals .",
    "an alternative approach is to examine well - defined copper single - crystal surfaces under ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) using x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "these techniques , used mainly by the surface science community , reveal structural details of the adsorbed system .",
    "the inhibitor molecules can be deposited onto the surface either from gas phase or via an aqueous solution ( which is subsequently evaporated ) .",
    "discrepancies are seen for different experimental conditions , with zigzag structures of flatly - adsorbed molecules having been postulated  @xcite ( for molecules deposited from aqueous solutions ) , as well as a structure of vertically - adsorbed btas  @xcite ( for evaporated molecules ) . in this work",
    "we only compare our results with experiments performed on evaporated btah molecules on copper substrates in uhv , since the computational work presented here consists of molecules adsorbed on a cu(111 ) surface in vacuum conditions .",
    "previous studies have shown that btah deprotonates when adsorbed on copper surfaces , revealing that it can deprotonate not only by interacting with high - ph environments ( its pk@xmath0 is @xmath1 at @xmath2 c ) but also through its interaction with the surface .",
    "bta was seen to form nearly - upright organometallic surface complexes involving bonds between the azole nitrogen atoms and copper adatoms  @xcite . in particular stm studies",
    "showed the formation of strings of stacked dimers at low coverage and of more complex structures , also composed of bta - cu@xmath3-bta dimers , at high coverage .",
    "a number of computational studies , using density functional theory ( dft ) , have looked at the stability of btah and bta structures on copper .",
    "benzotriazole is a challenging molecule to study with dft as it combines a strongly electronegative azole moiety , which preferably interacts with the surface through chemisorption , with a benzene - like ring which can interact with the surface via van der waals ( vdw ) forces .",
    "traditionally , vdw dispersion forces have been a challenge for dft methods and are not accounted for in the most widely used exchange - correlation functionals , such as perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite , that have been used in most previous studies of btah .",
    "thus the role of vdw forces in this type of system is still largely unexplored .",
    "isolated btah was found , in calculations using pbe , to chemisorb weakly to a cu(111 ) surface in an upright geometry , forming two n - cu bonds via the triazole moiety  @xcite .",
    "physisorption , with the molecule lying flat onto the surface , was found to yield a very small binding energy ( @xmath4 ev ) with pbe  @xcite .",
    "the addition of an empirical van der waals correction lead instead to a much stronger bond ( @xmath5 ev )  @xcite . at higher coverages  @xcite",
    ", btah was found to form hydrogen - bonded ( hb ) chains with the molecules lying parallel to the surface .",
    "the dehydrogenated bta molecule was found to bind strongly to the surface in an upright configuration  @xcite when isolated , and to form cu - bonded organometallic complexes of vertical or tilted molecules at higher coverages .",
    "however , the structure of the organometallic bta - cu@xmath3 complexes is still debated .",
    "chen and hakkinen  @xcite found that deprotonated bta - cu@xmath3-bta dimers are more stable than [ bta - cu@xmath3]@xmath7 chains thus agreeing with the experimental results of grillo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and in disagreement with the dft results of kokalj _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "here we report the most extensive dft study performed to date and we explore in depth the importance of using vdw approaches in the study of adsorbate - surface interactions .",
    "intramolecular interactions and coverage effects are also examined in detail ; they are found to be particularly relevant for the systems formed by fully protonated btahs , with hydrogen bonding dominating in the low - coverage structures and vdw and electrostatic forces at high coverage .",
    "moreover , the energetics of the dissociation process and of the formation of complex structures with cu adatoms were investigated and linked to experimental conditions .",
    "the obtained structures and adsorption energy trends are comparable to the experimental results in uhv and a link with the effectiveness of the molecule as a corrosion inhibitor is discussed .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the computational methodology and set - up is presented in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ method ] ) , followed by the results for the protonated ( sec .",
    "[ sub : btah_cu111 ] ) and deprotonated ( sec .",
    "[ sub : bta_cu111 ] ) molecules adsorbed on cu(111 ) .",
    "finally , a discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "calculations of inhibitor molecules adsorbed on copper surfaces were performed by means of dft using the vasp code  @xcite . in the present work most results",
    "have been obtained with the optb86b - vdw functional , a modified version of the non - local vdw density functional  @xcite which explicitly accounts for dispersion based on the electron density .",
    "indeed , optb86b - vdw has been shown to perform best in comparison to experiment for several adsorption problems  @xcite , including the ( relevant for this work ) adsorption of benzene on cu(111 )  @xcite .",
    "a number of other functionals were also considered for testing and comparison with previous results : pbe and a number of vdw - inclusive functionals ( vdw - df  @xcite , optb86b - vdw  @xcite , pbe - d2  @xcite and pbe - ts  @xcite ) . for all functionals",
    "the calculated value for the lattice constant @xmath8 and of the bulk modulus @xmath9 are within @xmath10 of the experimental value ( see table  [ table : tests ] ) , and in good agreement with previous theoretical results  @xcite .",
    ".lattice constants and bulk moduli for all the exchange - correlation functionals used in this work .",
    "all the values are in good agreement with the experimental values corrected for the zero - point anharmonic expansion  @xcite and with previous computational results  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these are compared to the formation energy of the most stable btah / cu(111 ) structure , the hb chains , and the blue highlighting indicates the deprotonated structures which are more stable than the btah / cu(111 ) system ( e@xmath11e@xmath12 ev ) .",
    "when the formation energy of the copper adatom is not taken into account ( top half of table  [ table : btah_form ] ) most deprotonated structures , except for the isolated bta molecule , are found to be more stable than the protonated hb chains . if the formation energy of the copper adatom is considered ( bottom half of table  [ table : btah_form ] ) , only the organometallic chains and the stacked dimers are found to be more stable that the btah hb chains , and only if the hydrogen atom is assumed to adsorb on the surface . if the h atoms are assumed to associate into h@xmath13 molecules the only competitive structure to the btah hb chains are the stacked dimers ( e@xmath14 ev / mol ) .",
    "this shows that benzotriazole has a higher drive to deprotonate on defective surfaces with cu adatoms than on atomically flat surfaces .",
    "the results obtained from these four extreme cases can be used to give an approximate description of the behaviour of a real experimental system . in the work of grillo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the copper surface is reconstructed and therefore the mobility of the surface copper atoms is low thus making this system close to the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : dep_adat]b , _ i.e. _ the copper adatoms need to be extracted from the bulk . in this case (",
    "table  [ table : btah_form ] ) the stacked bta - cu@xmath3-bta dimers , with the dissociated h atoms adsorbed on the surface , are the lowest energy configuration with e@xmath15 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the stm experimental results , where stacked dimers are observed at low coverage and where the reconstruction of the cu(111 ) surface , which is generally known not to reconstruct  @xcite , indicates the presence of impurities  @xcite ( such as h atoms ) on the surface .",
    "results for the structures and energies of btah and bta on cu(111 ) have been presented here .",
    "the adsorption of fully protonated btah is relevant to applications where the environment is acidic , whereas the adsorption of bta on copper is relevant to alkaline environments and to compare with experiments of btah deposition on copper in vacuum conditions , where the molecule is found to deprotonate .",
    "benzotriazole is a complex molecule which requires treatment with a theoretical methodology capable of simultaneously describing chemisorption and physisorption . in the present work dft with a vdw - inclusive",
    "functional has been employed to optimise a large number of protonated and deprotonated structures on cu(111 ) .",
    "we find that dispersion forces significantly alter the relative stabilities of adsorbed btah structures .",
    "in addition to this , in the lowest energy tilted structure an interesting interplay with chemical bonding is found wherein dispersion forces bring the molecule close to the surface thus enhancing the chemical bonding of the molecule with the surface via the triazole group . whilst this is interesting and a potentially general effect ,",
    "we have also shown that a single absorbed molecule provides limited insight into the behaviour of the overall system . indeed , while isolated btah preferentially adsorbs on copper via the azole nitrogen atoms and @xmath16-bonding of the carbon ring with the surface , the lowest energy structure at low coverage are hb chains of flat - lying molecules .",
    "overall we have found an incredibly rich coverage - dependent phase diagram for btah on cu(111 ) .",
    "three regimes were identified for the adsorption of btah on cu(111 ) , as a function of coverage : a low coverage hydrogen - bonded regime , where the molecules preferentially adsorb flat on the surface , an intermediate regime , where mixed flat and upright structures are observed , and a high coverage regime , where the molecules adsorb upright .",
    "steric interaction drive the change in configuration from the flat - lying physisorbed to the upright chemisorbed configuration of the btah .",
    "the lowest energy configurations seen for bta are either stacked bta - cu@xmath3-bta dimers or organometallic chains , according to whether the formation energy of the copper adatom is taken into account when calculating the stability of the complexes .",
    "good agreement is seen with experimental results in uhv , where the molecule was found to adsorb via the azole moiety in a vertical or near - vertical manner  @xcite . in particular , the stacked dimer configuration was observed using stm to form on a reconstructed cu(111 ) surface , where the mobility of the copper atoms is likely to be low and therefore copper adatoms require a large amount of energy to form . in this case , the conditions of fig .",
    "[ fig : dep_adat]b apply , and indeed the expected configuration from calculations are stacked bta - cu@xmath3-bta dimers .",
    "the use of a suitable exchange - correlation functional was found to be important for all the systems considered here . indeed , for an isolated btah on cu(111 ) the ` flat ' configuration was found to be favourable only when vdw dispersion forces were accounted for , and not in the case of pbe .",
    "moreover , the ` tilted ' low coverage structure , which is the most stable with the optb86b - vdw functional and is favourable with all vdw functionals tested , is instead unstable when optimized with pbe ( the ` flat ' configuration is retrieved instead ) . at high coverage",
    ", the lack of any description of @xmath16-@xmath16 bonding in pbe leads to a larger equilibrium distance between two btah molecules and thus to ( comparatively ) weaker adsorption energies for the high - coverage structures . in the bta / cu systems",
    "it has been seen that pbe favours upright adsorption , because of the lack of dispersion interactions between the benzene - like ring and the surface . when vdw interactions are accounted for a more complex behaviour is uncovered , especially for the bta - cu@xmath3-bta dimers where many degenerate low - energy structures are seen .",
    "both btah and bta offer the possibility of forming fairly close packed layers on cu(111 ) with little cost to the adsorption energy , and , for the case of bta , with a gain in energy when the dimers are stacked , thus in principle offering a physical barrier to incoming corrosive molecules or atoms .",
    "there is however a large difference ( @xmath17 ev / mol ) in the adsorption energy of the molecule with the surface between btah and bta .",
    "since benzotriazole performs better as an inhibitor in alkaline conditions , where the likelihood of deprotonation is higher , there might be a link between the strongest interaction of the molecule with the surface and inhibition .",
    "indeed , the adsorption energy of bta ( @xmath18 ev / atom ) is fairly close to the adsorption energy of _ e.g. _ two well known corrosive agents for copper .",
    "it is likely that the actual corrosive agents in a corrosive solution are sulphur- or chlorine - containing molecules , rather than isolated atoms .",
    "however , our calculations on chlorine and sulphur atoms give a ballpark estimate which suggests that competitive adsorption could be the key here for the success of benzotriazole as a corrosion inhibitor .",
