    "in this talk , i will summarize some recent developments in qcd , concentrating on , but not limited to , topics discussed at this meeting . details , of course , can be found in the talks themselves , presented in lively sessions organized by lance dixon and joey huston for perturbative qcd , and by paul mackenzie and claude bernard for nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the future of the field is in the already - advanced convergence of these topics , sometimes thought of as nearly independent .",
    "progress on heavy quark physics is described in the proceedings from separate parallel sessions and plenary talks .",
    "i must necessarily pass over some of the most interesting recent advances in other closely related fields as well for lack of space .",
    "i have tried in the following to interleave perturbative and nonperturbative treatments of qcd dynamics .",
    "let me begin with a few general comments on the place of qcd studies in high energy physics .",
    "_ why qcd ? _ by now it is clear that qcd is a  correct \" , or phenomenologically relevant theory , at least the way classical maxwell theory is  correct \" .",
    "classical electromagnetism is an effective theory appropriate to the limit of many photons ; quantum chromodynamics might be the long - distance limit of some more fundamental , underlying theory .",
    "its self - consistency , however , leaves us to free to study qcd in its own terms .",
    "this is a fascinating , and dauting , task , despite the fact that qcd is defined through a single dimensionless parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "the overall dimensional scale is determined by comparison with other interactions , for example , by measuring the strong coupling at the mass of the z : @xmath1 .",
    "its intrinsic interest aside , qcd has important  practical \" applications , in the calculation of backgrounds to new physics and , for hadron colliders particularly , in predictions for new particle cross sections . from a theoretical point of view , however , what makes qcd so attractive is that it is a quantum field theory that requires all orders in perturbation theory and nonperturbative analysis to confront data at available energies .",
    "_ qcd is the exemplary quantum field theory .",
    "_ qcd exhibits most of the classic quantum field - theoretic phenomena discovered in the sixties and seventies , including asymptotic freedom , confinement , spontaneous symmetry breaking and instantons .",
    "the problems of strong interactions that gave rise to qcd were also , in the same time period , the original inspiration for concepts of duality and strings . as we saw at this conference , the strong interactions , now understood as qcd , are once more the meeting ground for field theory , duality and string theory .    again , qcd is evidently the correct theory of the strong interactions .",
    "given its depth , however , ",
    "tests \" of qcd should be thought of as tests , or perhaps better ,  explorations \" , of quantum field theory itself .",
    "complementary to the extraordinary accuracy of selected perturbative predictions in quantum electrodynamics are the broad predictions of qcd , interweaving nonperturbative and perturbative scales and phenomena .",
    "it was the asymptotic freedom of qcd that first drew attention to gauge field theory as the unique description of the strong interactions at short distances .",
    "this theme continues to unfold in current experiments , and to provide a basis for extrapolations between energy scales and the detection of signals for new physics .",
    "let us begin with a run - through of the underlying methods .",
    "_ infrared safety . _ infrared safe quantities are insensitive to long - distance effects , and may be calculated in perturbation theory @xcite",
    ". an infrared safe quantity may or may not be directly observable .",
    "the classic examples include the total cross section for @xmath2 annihilation to hadrons , and jet and event shape cross sections in @xmath2 .",

    ", there is a complementarity between the roles of parton distributions and the hard scattering .",
    "the distributions @xmath11 are universal among hard - scattering processes , but particular to hadron @xmath7 , while the functions @xmath12 are particular to the process , but universal among external hadrons .",

    "( [ irs ] ) and ( [ fact ] ) above must both be independent of the scales @xmath13 that define the parton distributions : @xmath14 .",

    "next - to - leading \" order calculation of its hard scattering functions @xmath18 , we determine nlo parton distributions @xmath19 at @xmath20 . using evolution",
    ", we can then predict @xmath16 for any hard process at all @xmath21 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath3 in eq .  (",
    "[ irs ] ) are known for many processes to nlo @xcite .",
    "they have been determined at nnlo for inclusive dis and drell - yan @xcite , and even to three loops @xcite for selected quantities .",
    "generally , two loop corrections are available only for single - scale processes , and the calculation of two - loop corrections for genuine scattering diagrams is an as - yet unsolved , but actively studied , problem in qcd @xcite .",
    "perturbative qcd is most successful for inclusive processes , and/or single - scale semi - inclusive .",
    "evolution in dis is perhaps still the best illustration ( see below ) .",
    "the current experimental situation in hadronic hard - scattering is reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in multiscale problems ,",
    "logarithms of ratios of distinct but perturbative scales often require resummation to all orders .",
    "formally beyond perturbative resummation , but not always less important numerically , are corrections suppressed by powers of the hard scale(s ) . in dis , and a few other cases , these corrections can be described by the operator product expansion",
    ". we shall encounter below  generalizations \" of this famous technique , usually in the form of effective field theories .      _ tevatron jets . _",
    "the most impressive success in orders of magnitude continues to be the tevatron inclusive single - jet and dijet cross sections @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cteqsinglejet ] , which shows a plot from ref .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ fact ] ) , these cross sections are of the form _ p|pj+x=_ab f_a / p^(nlo)_abj+xf_b/|p",
    ". [ 1jet ] we find a consistency between nlo theory and experiment at a few tens of percent , well within the overall systematic errors , over a range in which the cross section decreases by seven or so factors of ten .",
    "as the figure shows , reasonable choices of parton distributions ( in this case cteq5hj ) can account even for the highest - momentum data , although a slight difference remains between the d0 and cdf data at the high end .    _ dis scaling violations .",

    ".    the quality of the data , and of qcd fits to it , is illustrated by recent results on @xmath25 from h1 @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ h12 ] for various fixed @xmath24 as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "notice in particular the sharp rise of @xmath27 with @xmath26 for the smaller values of @xmath24 .",
    "this is a prediction of the evolution through parton branching described by eq .",
    "( [ factevol ] ) .",
    "deviations from such dglap evolution have been surprisingly difficult to find .",
    "the interesting results of a next - to - next to leading order analysis of dis has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the other end of the spectrum ,",
    "the excess of events reported two years ago at the largest @xmath24 and @xmath26 has all but disappeared @xcite .",
    "_ multijets , and event shapes . _ in @xmath2 annihilation , the born level process @xmath28 produces two jets , as is the case as well for hadron colliders , while in dis , the born scattering produces a single jet . in all three  canonical \" scattering processes ,",
    "the cross sections for the minimal reactions are known at nlo . beyond this , nlo cross sections are available for two jets in dis @xcite , for four in @xmath2 @xcite , and nlo three - jet cross sections are just now becoming available for hadron - hadron scattering @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen an explosion of data on these processes , and new results were discussed at this conference in @xcite , along with jet fragmentation properties @xcite .",
    "the production of vector bosons associated with jets @xcite is another important source of information about short - distance dynamics , and a reanalysis of w+1 jet cross sections has brought them back into agreement with theory over the past year .",
    "jets are theoretical - phenomenological constructs @xcite . their value is not that they are an exact reflection of short - distance reactions , but that , if they are defined properly , they are related to them in a calculable fashion .",
    "jets are generally defined in terms of energy flow into some angular region , or in terms of interative clustering schemes for the momenta of observed particles .",
    "any ( sufficiently smooth @xcite ) quantity that is insensitive to the emission of zero - momentum particles , or to the collinear branching of finite - energy massless particles , can be used to define an infrared - safe cross section .",
    "event shapes in @xmath2 annihilation or dis are chosen for this property .",
    "the best - known is the thrust , defined for individual events as the maximum fractional projection of the momenta of observed particles on an axis , as that axis is varied about the unit sphere .",
    "although event shape cross sections are infrared safe , they generally receive nonperturbative corrections that decrease rather slowly with energy , typically as a single power @xcite , _",
    "phys=^pt ( 1 + o(1/q ) ) .",
    "[ 1overq ] the theory of these power corrections is a passageway between the short - distance perturbative , and the long - distance nonperturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "we shall have more to say about them below .    _",
    "the @xmath29 lineup . _ any of the short - distance cross sections above allows a determination of the strong coupling .",
    "for example , in a factorized cross section , eq .",
    "( [ fact ] ) , given parton distributions @xmath30 , we compare @xmath31 to experiment , and solve for @xmath0 , typically evaluated at a renormalization scale equal to the factorization scale .",
    "other , more refined , choices @xcite are related by perturbative corrections . for cross sections that are infrared safe , as jet or event shape cross sections at lep @xcite , the comparison is even more direct , although power corrections , as in eq .",
    "( [ 1overq ] ) , must be taken into account for any precise determination @xcite .",
    "yet another way of determining @xmath29 is from lattice qcd calculations of energy level differences in heavy quark systems .",
    "these may be related , on the one hand to the strong coupling , and on the other to experiment , which then determines the size of the coupling at a scale that grows with the heavy quark mass .",
    "for ease of comparison , the couplings can be evolved to the mass of the z , at which a  world average \" of @xmath32 has been quoted in ref .  @xcite . since varied experiments",
    "measure the coupling over a wide range of scales , fig .",
    "[ alphafig ] , which shows the variation of measured @xmath33 with @xmath13 illustrates one of the great successes of renormalized field theory .      in the presence of multiple scales , high order contributions to hard scattering functions",
    "@xmath12 can become important .",
    "for example , in eq .",
    "( [ fact ] ) , the limit @xmath34 is associated with integrable singularities that usually enhance the cross section . these  threshold \" singularities were resummed long ago for the drell - yan cross section , and have been applied for some time to top production at leading - log accuracy @xcite . in",
    "qcd hard - scatterings , such as heavy quark and jet production , color exchange makes the resummation somewhat more complex beyond leading log .",
    "this problem has now been solved , and threshold resummation is understood in principle for a wide variety of hard scattering cross sections @xcite . as a practical matter , differing approaches to the inversion of certain mellin transforms can lead to differing numerical predictions . from a broad perspective , however , the main lesson is that the theory stays relatively close to nlo for cross sections like top production , even in the presence of superficially large corrections at higher order .",
    "an important observation @xcite , made particularly clear in the very recent publication @xcite , is a marked decrease in factorization - scale dependence for resummed cross sections .",
    "another example , currently being discussed widely , is related to the data of fig .",
    "[ e706fig ] , single - photon and pion inclusive cross sections measured by the fixed - target fermilab experiment e706 @xcite .",
    "so far , this data can be fit only by supplementing nlo with the old method of @xmath35 smearing for the initial partons @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it has been noted that the full range of fixed - target direct photon data may not be consistent among themselves @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that at collider energies , experiment and nlo agree , at least at the higher transverse momenta @xcite .",
    "can the resummation of higher orders in qcd lead to an effective @xmath35 smearing ? for w or z production at low transverse momentum ,",
    "the answer is yes , and the formalism has existed for some time . in this case , fitting the cross section @xcite requires the introduction of nonperturbative parameters that are accessible to experiment . in the past year or two , there has been some discussion on the best way of going about this @xcite , but the underlying theory is relatively well - understood . the same can not be said for w or photon cross sections at high transverse momenta , because the logarithms whose resummation requires the nonperturbative input at @xmath36 cancel order - by - order in perturbation theory in the calculation of @xmath37 at high @xmath38 .",
    "interesting observations on the relationship between the two regimes have been made , however @xcite , and futher progress in this direction can be anticipated in the coming year .",
    "one of the major challenges in perturbative qcd is the development of a theory of these and related higher - order effects , and a method for estimating their importance .",
    "we shall return to developments on resummation below .",
    "the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in eq .",
    "( [ fact ] ) summarize the structure of hadrons as seen at short distances , one parton at a time . as the hadron is probed at ever shorter distances , the distributions evolve perturbatively according to eq .  ( [ evol ] ) , but the boundary condition for this evolution stands as a truely nonperturbative reflection of the dynamics that holds the hadron together .",
    "these parton distributions have been the subject of intense study since the recognition of approximate scaling in dis structure functions thirty years ago .    over the past decade , two groups , cteq and mrs , whose memberships have themselves evolved somewhat , have undertaken coordinated  global \" approaches to the determination of parton distributions , taking into account data from a variety of processes and momentum scales .",
    "the past year has seen the development of the latest , best fits of these two groups , mrst @xcite and cteq5 @xcite , which were discussed and compared at the conference in @xcite .",
    "global fits test the self - consistency of factorized cross sections in the sense that the fits are overconstrained , and because they can be checked against experiments not incorporated into the fits .",
    "nevertheless , the fits must be improved as the data improves , and as it extends to extreme values of fractional momenta .",
    "surprises can occur , especially in regions where a particular parton distribution does not contribute at leading order .",
    "examples of such refinements from 1998 involved the ratio of @xmath39 to @xmath40 quarks in the proton , as tested by the w asymmetry @xcite and drell - yan @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "indirect constraints on parton distribution functions are tentative .",
    "other cases where the results of global fits have been rethought involve higher - order or power (  higher - twist \" ) corrections to the cross section .",
    "the extraction of pdfs requires a parameterization of such effects , assuming that they can be brought under control .",
    "examples include the role of higher twist in the extraction of neutron pdfs from deuterium data @xcite .    up to this cycle of global fits , the primary processes employed were dis , drell - yan and direct photons , the latter thought to be especially valuable for constraining the gluon distribution , which does not appear at leading order in the other two .",
    "the data of e706 @xcite , however , a sample of which was shown above in fig",
    ".  [ e706fig ] , has thrown this neat picture into disarray , as it disagrees decisively with the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ fact ] ) at nlo .",
    "a @xmath35 smearing approach has been used in the mrst fits of last year @xcite .",
    "the cteq5 fits abandon direct photons in favor of jet cross sections to constrain the gluon at large @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "yet another interesting problem is the treatment of heavy quarks . for energies near a heavy - quark mass , @xmath41",
    ", their production may be calculated directly as a hard process , part of @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ fact ] ) . for energies much above @xmath41",
    ", however , it may be advantageous to treat the heavy quark as a parton , thus automatically resumming logs of @xmath42 . a number of schemes to make this transition have been proposed @xcite , to treat charmed quark production at hera .",
    "the sophistication of these considerations of global analysis , and the need to make accurate predictions at high energy raises the question of how to estimate uncertainties in the distributions @xcite . in part to explore these issues , new sets of distributions have been produced based on dis data only @xcite , and methods have been introduced to quantify uncertainties systematically through statistical analysis @xcite .",
    "the past few years has seen a rebirth of interest in the high - energy physics of spin , which , with advances in the technology of polarized beams and targets , has made possible the systematic study of spin at the parton level @xcite .",
    "the dis cross section for a nucleon with spin @xmath43 may be represented in the standard form @xmath44 , in terms of spin structure functions defined as w _ = w_^unpol + ie_e - e_e_q^s^ g_1(x , q ) + i(e_e - e_e)^2_q^g_2(x , q ) .",
    "[ spinstructure ] the function @xmath45 has a particularly transparent interpretation in terms of quark helicity : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the difference between the distributions of quarks with helicity parallel to the hadron s helicity and against it . at this conference , precision data for @xmath48 and @xmath49 were presented by e155 @xcite .",
    "one result of these measurements is a test of of the benchmark bjorken sum rule , _ 0 ^ 1 ( g_1^p(x)-g_1^n(x))dx = 16 |g_ag_v| ( 1+c_n_s^n ) , [ bjsr ] which is now verified to a new level of accuracy .",
    "the  spin \" distributions of the nucleon , such as @xmath47 , do not necessarily describe its full spin content , and the possibility of orbital angular momentum must also be taken into account . at the same time , for gluons the distinction between these two types of angular momentum is not gauge invariant . this problem notwithstanding , an attractive formalism for the description of orbital angular momentum has been proposed @xcite , in terms of form factors , @xmath50 $ ] , which arise in matrix elements of the energy - momentum tensor , p+| t_q , g^    zero momentum transfer , the @xmath51 become expectation values of the angular momentum operators _ q = d^3x , _ g = d^3x(*e * ) . the measurement of these off - diagonal matrix elements , unlike the diagonal matrix elements that define classic pdfs ( see eq .",

    "the measurement of such amplitudes is a challenge , but one that is of great interest for the jefferson laboratory facility , and there is a correspondingly vigorous theoretical program to study the factorization and evolution properties of off - diagonal distributions @xcite .",
    "off - diagonal matrix elements interpolate , in some ways , between inclusive and exclusive processes , and between parton distributions and hadronic light - cone wave functions @xcite .",
    "the consideration of orbital angular momentum leads us to the doorstep of the long - distance , low - energy properties of hadrons , where progress has continued in lattice qcd and instanton studies .",
    "lattice methods @xcite approach qcd from a limit complementary to perturbation theory , and make possible direct calculation of long - distance properties of hadrons .",
