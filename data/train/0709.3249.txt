    "an accurate knowledge of perturbative qcd is an essential ingredient in phenomenological studies at present and future colliders . at high center of mass energies",
    "the theoretical study of multijet events becomes an increasingly important task . in the context of collinear factorization",
    "the calculation of multijet production is complicated because of the large number of contributing diagrams .",
    "there is , however , a region of phase space where it is indeed possible to describe the production of a large number of jets : the regge asymptotics ( small@xmath1 region ) of scattering amplitudes .",
    "if the jets are well separated in rapidity , the corresponding matrix element factorizes with effective vertices for the jet production connected by a chain of @xmath2-channel reggeons .",
    "a perturbative analysis of these diagrams shows that it is possible to resum contributions of the form @xmath3 to all orders , with @xmath4 being the coupling constant for the strong interaction .",
    "this can be achieved by means of the balitsky ",
    "kuraev  lipatov ( bfkl ) equation  @xcite .",
    "the bfkl approach relies on the concept of the _ reggeized gluon _ or _",
    "reggeon_. in regge asymptotics colour octet exchange can be effectively described by a @xmath2channel gluon with its propagator being modified by a multiplicative factor depending on a power of @xmath5 .",
    "this power corresponds to the _ gluon regge trajectory _ which is a function of the transverse momenta and is divergent in the infrared .",
    "this divergence is removed when real emissions are included using gauge invariant reggeon ",
    "reggeon  gluon couplings .",
    "this allows us to describe scattering amplitudes with a large number of partons in the final state .",
    "the @xmath3 terms correspond to the leading  order ( lo ) approximation and provide a simple picture of the underlying physics .",
    "this approximation has limitations : in leading order both @xmath4 and the factor scaling the energy @xmath5 in the resummed logarithms , @xmath6 , are free parameters not determined by the theory .",
    "these free parameters can be fixed if next  to  leading terms @xmath7 are included  @xcite . at this improved accuracy ,",
    "diagrams contributing to the running of the coupling have to be included , and also @xmath6 is not longer undetermined . the phenomenological importance of the nlo effects has been recently shown in the scattering of virtual photons into vector mesons @xcite as well as for azimuthal angle decorrelations in mueller  navelet jets in refs .",
    "@xcite and in deep inelastic scattering in ref .  @xcite .    while at lo the only emission vertex  the reggeon - reggeon - gluon vertex  can be identified with the production of one jet , at nlo also reggeon - reggeon - gluon - gluon and reggeon - reggeon - quark - antiquark vertices enter the game . in this contribution",
    "we are interested in the description of the inclusive production of a single jet in the nlo bfkl formalism .",
    "the relevant events will be those with only one jet produced in the central rapidity region of the detector .",
    "due to these new emission vertices at nlo we have to introduce a jet definition discriminating between the production of one or two jets by two particles .",
    "it is not sufficient to simply start from the fully integrated emission vertex available in the literature @xcite .",
    "rather , we have to carefully separate all the different contributions in its unintegrated form before we can combine them .",
    "the present text is focused on describing the main elements of the analysis presented in refs .",
    "there we show that this procedure enables us to determine the right choice of energy scales relevant for the process .",
    "particular attention is given to the separation of multi - regge and quasi - multi - regge kinematics .",
    "there we also discuss similarities and discrepancies with the earlier work of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as it turns out , the scale of the two projectiles in the scattering process has a large impact on the structure of the result .",
    "the jet vertex can not be constructed without properly defining the interface to the scattering objects . to show this",
    ", we will perform this study for two different cases : the jet production in the scattering of two photons with large and similar virtualities , and in hadron - hadron collisions . in the former case the cross section has a factorized form in terms of the photon impact factors and of the gluon green s function which is valid in the regge limit . in the latter case ,",
    "since the momentum scale of the hadron is substantially lower than the typical @xmath0 entering the production vertex , the gluon green s function for hadron - hadron collisions has a slightly different bfkl kernel which , in particular , also incorporates some @xmath0-evolution from the nonperturbative , and model dependent , proton impact factor to the perturbative jet production vertex .",
    "our final expression for the cross section of the jet production in hadron - hadron scattering contains an _ unintegrated gluon density_. this density depends on the longitudinal momentum fraction  as it also happens in the conventional collinear factorization  and on the transverse momentum @xmath0 .",
    "as an important ingredient , the hard subprocesse ( in our case , the production vertex ) depends on the ( off - shell ) initial parton momenta .",
    "this scheme of @xmath0factorization has been introduced by catani et al .",
    "@xcite , and up to now it has been considered only at lo .",
    "our results , valid in the small@xmath1 limit , show that it is possible to extend this scheme to nlo .",
    "let us start the discussion by considering the interaction between two photons with large virtualities @xmath8 in the regge limit @xmath9 . in this region",
    "the total cross section can be written as a convolution of the photon impact factors with the gluon green s function , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath10 a convenient choice for the energy scale is @xmath11 which naturally introduces the rapidities @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the emitted particles with momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 given that @xmath16 .",
    "the gluon green s function @xmath17 corresponds to the solution of the bfkl equation @xmath18 with kernel @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gluon regge trajectory and @xmath21 is the real emission contribution to the kernel which is of special interest in the following .",
    "it is possible to single out one gluon emission by extracting its emission probability from the bfkl kernel . by selecting one emission to be exclusive",
    "we factorize the gluon green s function into two components .",
    "each of them connects one of the external particles to the jet vertex , and depends on the total energies of the subsystems @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we have drawn a graph indicating this separation in fig .",
    "[ fig : crosslo ] .",
    "the symmetric situation suggests the choices @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , as the suitable energy scales for the subsystems .",
    "these choices can be related to the relative rapidity between the jet and the external particles . to set the ground for the nlo discussion of next section",
    "we introduce an additional integration over the rapidity @xmath26 of the central system in the form @xmath27\\\\ \\times \\mathcal{v}({{\\bf q}_a},{{\\bf q}_b},\\eta;{{\\bf k}_j},y_j)\\ ; \\times \\left[\\int\\frac{d^2 { { \\bf k}_b}}{2\\pi{{\\bf k}_b}^2 } \\ ,   \\phi_b({{\\bf k}_b } ) \\int_{\\delta - i\\infty}^{\\delta+i\\infty}\\frac{d\\omega'}{2\\pi i } e^{\\omega'(\\eta - y_b)}f_{\\omega'}(-{{\\bf q}_b},-{{\\bf k}_b})\\right ]   \\label{eq : masterformula1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with the lo emission vertex being @xmath28         in hadron ",
    "hadron collisions the colliding external particles do not provide a perturbative scale . there the jet is the only hard scale in the process and we have to deal with an asymmetric situation . in such a configuration the scales @xmath6 should be chosen as @xmath29 alone . at lo accuracy @xmath6",
    "is arbitrary and we are indeed free to make this choice . at this stage it is possible to introduce the concept of _ unintegrated gluon density _ in the hadron .",
    "this represents the probability of resolving a gluon carrying a longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 from the incoming hadron , and with a certain transverse momentum @xmath0 .",
    "its relation to the gluon green s function would be @xmath30 with this new interpretation we can then rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath31 with the lo jet vertex for the asymmetric situation being @xmath32",
    "it is possible to follow a similar approach when jet production is considered at nlo .",
    "the crucial step in this direction is to modify the lo jet vertex of eq .   and eq .   to include new configurations present at nlo .",
    "we show how this is done in the following first subsection . in the second subsection",
    "we implement this vertex in a scattering process . in case of hadron ",
    "hadron scattering we extend the concept of unintegrated gluon density of eq .",
    "to nlo accuracy .",
    "most importantly , it is shown that a correct choice of intermediate energy scales in this case implies a modification of the impact factors , the jet vertex , and the evolution kernel .",
    "for those parts of the nlo kernel responsible for one gluon production we proceed in exactly the same way as at lo .",
    "the treatment of those terms related to two particle production is more complicated since for them it is necessary to introduce a jet algorithm . in general terms , if the two emissions generated by the kernel are nearby in phase space they will be considered as one single jet , otherwise one of them will be identified as the jet whereas the other will be absorbed as an untagged inclusive contribution .",
    "hadronization effects in the final state are neglected and we simply define a cone of radius @xmath33 in the rapidity  azimuthal angle space such that two particles form a single jet if @xmath34 . as long as only two emissions",
    "are involved this is equivalent to the @xmath0clustering algorithm .    to introduce the jet definition in the @xmath35 components of the kernel",
    "it is convenient to combine the gluon and quark matrix elements together with the mrk contribution : @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the two particle production amplitudes . at nlo",
    "it is necessary to separate multi - regge kinematics ( mrk ) from quasi - multi - regge kinematics ( qmrk ) in a distinct way . with this purpose",
    "we introduce an additional scale , @xmath38 .",
    "the meaning of mrk is that the invariant mass of two emissions is considered larger than @xmath38 while in qmrk the invariant mass of one pair of these emissions is below this scale .    the nlo version of eq",

    "these are related to the properties of the produced jet in different ways depending on the origin of the jet : if only one gluon was produced in mrk this corresponds to the configuration ( a ) in the table below , if two particles in qmrk form a jet then we have the case ( b ) , and finally case ( c ) if the jet is produced out of one of the partons in qmrk .",
    "the factor of 2 in the last term of eq .",
    "accounts for the possibility that either emitted particle can form the jet .",
    "the vertex can be written in a similar way if one chooses to work in @xmath1 configuration language . just by kinematics",
    "we get the explicit expressions for the different @xmath1 configurations listed in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the nlo virtual correction to the one  gluon emission kernel , @xmath42 , was originally calculated in ref .",
    "it includes explicit infrared divergences which are canceled by the real contributions .",
    "the introduction of the jet definition divides the phase space into different sectors .",
    "only if the divergent terms belong to the same configuration this cancellation can be shown analytically . with this in mind",

    "the remainder is explicitly free of divergences as well since these have been subtracted out .",
    "the nlo corrections to the kernel have been derived in the situation of the scattering of two objects with an intrinsic hard scale .",
    "hence in the case of @xmath47 scattering the equation is valid also at nlo if we replace the building blocks by their nlo counterparts . the most important piece being the jet vertex , which should be replaced by the one derived in the previous subsection .",
    "we now turn to the case of hadron collisions where mrk has to be necessarily modified to include some evolution in the transverse momenta , since the momentum of the jet will be much larger than the typical transverse scale associated to the hadron . in the lo case we have already explained that , in order to move from the symmetric case to the asymmetric one , it is needed to change the energy scale . the independence of the result from this choice is guaranteed by a compensating modification of the impact factors @xmath48 and the evolution kernel @xmath49 which corresponds to the first nlo term of a collinear resummation @xcite .",
    "the emission vertex couples as a kind of impact factor to both green s functions and receives two such modifications : @xmath50",
    "we have extended the nlo bfkl calculations to derive a nlo jet production vertex in @xmath0factorization .",
    "our procedure was to ` open ' the bfkl kernel to introduce a jet definition at nlo in a consistent way .",
    "as the central result , we have defined the off - shell jet production vertex and have shown how it can be used in the context of @xmath47 or of hadron ",
    "hadron scattering to calculate inclusive single jet cross sections . for this purpose",
    "we have formulated , on the basis of the nlo bfkl equation , a nlo unintegrated gluon density valid in the small@xmath1 regime .",
    "more recently , a slightly different @xmath0factorization scheme has been investigated @xcite .",
    "a precise analysis of the connection between the two approaches is in progress ."
