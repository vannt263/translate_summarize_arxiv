    "knowledge of the @xmath0-wave scattering length plays a crucial role in the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in ultracold atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "a positive sign of the scattering length indicates that a bose - einstein condensate is stable whereas a negative sign indicates an unstable or collapsing condensate .",
    "also its magnitude is crucial in the formation of bec , as it determines the elastic and inelastic collision rates . for efficient evaporative cooling a large scattering length",
    "is required , however for a too large scattering length three - body recombination loss limits the formation and collisional stability of a bec .",
    "this gives rise to a range of about @xmath2 ( @xmath3=0.5292  nm ) that can be considered favorable .",
    "alkaline - earth elements and the alike ytterbium ( yb ) system have been the center of attraction in ultra - cold atom research because of their unique atomic structure and the availability of different stable isotopes with zero nuclear spin ( bosons ) and with large nuclear spin ( fermions ) .",
    "they are being used in frequency metrology  @xcite and are proposed for quantum information processing  @xcite .",

    "in general , isotopes of an element have different scattering lengths . therefore the ability of bec formation depends crucially on the chosen isotope .",
    "for instance , the scattering length of @xmath4sr is 123@xmath11  @xcite , which made it an ideal candidate to achieve bec despite its low abundance of only 0.6%  @xcite , as compared to the more abundant @xmath5sr ( 10% , 800@xmath11 @xcite ) and @xmath6sr ( 83% , -2@xmath11 @xcite ) , either suffering strong losses  @xcite or requiring sympathetic cooling with another isotope  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the @xmath1ca isotope has a large scattering length of about 440@xmath11  @xcite , limiting the size and stability of bec .",
    "motivated by the success of bec in sr and yb even isotopes , and @xmath1ca , we carried out calculations to obtain the scattering lengths for all the even ( bosonic ) isotopes of ca and ba , for which mass and abundance are summarized in table  [ isotopes ] .",
    "laser cooling and trapping of all stable ca isotopes have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the demonstration of magneto - optical trapping of ba  @xcite has opened its use for ultra - cold collision studies , photoassociation spectroscopy and bose - einstein condensation .",

    "in summary , we have investigated the @xmath0-wave scattering lengths of the ca and ba even ( bosonic ) isotopes . an experimentally accurate ground state potential of ca@xmath28 enabled us to calculate the scattering lengths for all the isotopes , taking knowledge of @xmath1ca scattering length as a reference .",
    "we have observed that accidentally scattering resonances appear near all even isotopes , leading to large positive and negative scattering lengths for all isotopes .",
    "only @xmath25ca shows a small improvement in terms of scattering length compared to @xmath1ca .",
    "therefore , alternative methods to that of evaporative cooling are interesting for ca , such as direct laser cooling into quantum degeneracy using a narrow transition  @xcite .    in addition , scattering lengths for all the even ba isotopes have been investigated using a tang - toennies model potential .",
    "in contrast to the ca case , here the scattering lengths vary strongly over the isotopes , resulting in a high probability that at least one isotope has a favorable scattering length to produce a bec .",
    "more accurate knowledge of the ground state ba@xmath21 potential , including the long - range coefficients , based on experimental data that covers the full vibrational spectrum is needed for an improved determination of the scattering lengths .",
