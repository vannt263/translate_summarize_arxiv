    "they have tendency to keep together rather than scatter as it is visible in fig [ bias ] .",
    "the reason is that those particles that became separated from dimers at the top of the cloud are forced to go down and they stay within whole group of particles forming dimers , while those separated from the bottom continue their motion down , so we can see diluted particle cloud below main part of the system .",

    "finally we show how the existence of trapping sites at the surface changes direction of the moving particle cloud .",
    "such trapping sites can be present at the surface due to different reasons : defects , the existence of other particles or strain of the surface .",
    "the mixture of particles and dimers is analyzed and as assumed above particles move in different way than dimers .",
    "the surface along which particles are driven contains some special regions with traps .",
    "trapped particles can jump out from a trapping site and probability of this process is assumed to be @xmath164 .",
    "we study flow of driven particle flux over surfaces with patterned stripes oriented in different ways . in these regions 0.2",
    "fraction of sites have lower energy and work as trapping sites .",
    "their positions are chosen at random . in fig .",
    "[ bias2 ] we show how the system of driven particles behaves at the patterned surface .",
    "particles enter the system on the left side between positions @xmath165 to @xmath166 along @xmath14 axis building rather sparse cloud .",
    "they are forced to move to the right .",
    "when they reach the patterned region part of them are trapped and form dimers , which have different jump rates than individual particles .",
    "panel at the left top side of the figure illustrates particles coming through the vertical potential stripes .",
    "we can see that particles are moved up inside patterned stripes and they flow down in the region outside until they reach the second stripe with the same result .",
    "next panel shows different orientation of patterned stripe . at the right top panel stripe",
    "is rotated 30@xmath167 from @xmath11 axis . in such a case particles also penetrate barrier with traps and , similarly as in the previous case , particles are driven up inside the stripe .",
    "when we rotate the stripe further toward axis @xmath11 , particles stop penetration of the barrier and start to slide along its border .",
    "it is very clearly seen in left bottom side of fig [ bias2 ] , where situation for the horizontal stripe is presented . here",
    "particles penetrate a short distance of the region with traps , then next particles are reflected from this region .",
    "the behavior of particles and dimers mixture can be compared with the behavior of the system of single particles driven across horizontal barrier in right bottom panel of fig [ bias ] .",
    "particles penetrate barrier without any change of the direction of their motion .",
    "it can be seen that in the system of different jump anisotropy for particles and dimers properly oriented region of trapping sites can act as filter or particle mirror at the surface .",
    "it can lead to self - organization of the particle mixture .",
    "collective diffusion over anisotropic surfaces was analyzed .",
    "it was shown how the mixture of particles and dimers behaves when the anisotropy of individual particle jumps is different than that for dimers .",
    "jump anisotropy , defined by the relative values of consecutive jumps along @xmath11 and @xmath14 axes can be oriented in any direction , for particles and dimers independently .",
    "explicit expression for the diffusion coefficient matrix was derived for the single particle system and for the mixture .",
    "diffusion in both cases was illustrated in the exemplary systems with almost perpendicular particle and dimer anisotropy axes .",
    "driven diffusive motion over the anisotropic surface was studied in the region above the linear response limit .",
    "we have shown that when the easy diffusion axes of both mixture components are totally different the flow of diluted driven particle cloud changes its direction in the region of trapping centers at the surface .",
