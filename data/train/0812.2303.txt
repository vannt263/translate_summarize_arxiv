    "the object of our considerations is a special case of fokker - planck equation , which describes evolution of 3d continuum of non - interacting particles imbedded in a dense medium without outer forces .",
    "the interaction between particles and medium combines diffusion in physical space and velocities space .",
    "classic fokker - planck equation contains only two forces , which act on particles : damping force proportional to velocity and random force .",
    "the aim of this work is to derive equation for the case of constrained movement - the space density of particles remains constant . as a result , our equation contains the third force - constraint reaction .",
    "this is equivalent to hydrostatic pressure .",
    "our starting point is the classical fokker - planck equation :    @xmath0    where    @xmath1 - density ;    @xmath2 - time variable ;    @xmath3 - space coordinates ;    @xmath4 - velocities ;    @xmath5 - coefficient of damping ;",
    "@xmath6 - coefficient of diffusion .    in the following section we add to this equation terms due to reaction of constraints and",
    "thus derive the fokker - planck equation for incompressible fluid .",
    "then we rewrite the equation for curvilinear coordinates . in the fourth section",
    "we obtain a stationary solution of fokker - planck equation for incompressible fluid and in the fifth section we derive linearized equation . in the last section",
    "we introduce symmetries of fokker - planck equation for incompressible fluid .",
    "in our previous work ( see ref . [ 1 - 2 ] ) we deducted equation ( 1 ) from the kinematic equation ( see below ) .",
    "the crucial point is expression for the force , which acts upon particles .",
    "we represented the force as a sum of random force @xmath7 and friction force , which is proportional to the velocity :    @xmath8    we calculated random force @xmath7 from the law    @xmath9    ( 2 - 3 ) give explicit expressions for the forces .",
    "as we show in [ 2 ] , ( 2 - 3 ) imply equation ( 1 ) .",
    "now we try to get expression for reaction of constraint .",
    "we need some additional principle for this purpose . in the following",
    "we accept the gauss principle of least constraint ( see [ 3 ] ) .",
    "gauss principle reads for discrete system of particles :    @xmath10    where    @xmath11 - material point coordinates ;    @xmath12 - accelerations ;    @xmath13 - components of outer forces , acting on this point .",
    "they are dependent on coordinates @xmath11 and velocities @xmath14 .",
    "besides @xmath13 reactions of constraints are also to be considered , though they are not given explicitly .",
    "they appear as lagrange multipliers of constrains .",
    "let us suppose , that coordinates @xmath11 and velocities @xmath14 are kinematically possible , that is they satisfy constraints ( holonomic or nonholonomic )",
    ". then effective accelerations @xmath12 provide minimum of @xmath15 , comparing with all kinematically possible accelerations .",
    "the derivation of reactions of constrains for the simple case of discrete system of particles is straightforward ( see [ 3 ] )",
    ". we deal with more complicated case of continuum with dispersed velocities - many particles with different velocities are simultaneously placed in each point of space .    but first of all we examine first intermediate case of continuum with uniquely defined velocities field , which is simpler . for this case",
    "the gauss principle was used in [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .",
    "for such a continuum ( fluid ) we have the following expression for accelerations :    @xmath16    in this way we get the following expression for gauss functional :    @xmath17    condition of incompressibility of the velocities field @xmath18 is    @xmath19    differentiating ( 7 ) on time , we get expression for constraint on accelerations field :    @xmath20    this implies the following constraint on accelerations @xmath21 :    @xmath22    to take in account ( 9 ) we use lagrange multipliers method .",
    "this gives following modified expression for gauss functional :    @xmath23\\   dv .",
    "\\eqno ( 10)\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is lagrange multiplier for constraint ( 9 ) .",
    "we seek the extreme of functional ( 10 ) with @xmath25 as unknown variables .",
    "variational euler equations for functional ( 10 ) are    @xmath26    they are identical to standard euler equations for incompressible fluid .",
    "we see , that lagrange s multiplier @xmath24 is pressure and @xmath27 is expression for reaction of incompressibility constraint .",
    "we conclude , that as for get fokker - planck equation for incompressible fluid we should :    - to add to system additional equation - expression for incompressibility constraint ;    - to add to all forces , acting on particle ( see ( 2 ) ) , gradient of the pressure as reaction of ideal constraint .",
    "@xmath28    in this way we get the following system with one integral constraint expression and one differential equation .    where @xmath29 is constant density .",
    "\\(13 ) imply equations @xmath30 .",
    "this derivation method is insufficient , because we obtained expression ( 12 ) from the wrong model .",
    "now we return to the case of continuum with dispersed velocities - there exist many particles with different velocities in each point of space .",
    "kinematic of single particle is described by differential equations :    @xmath31    @xmath32    where    @xmath33 - space coordinates ;    @xmath34 - velocities of particles ;    @xmath35 - accelerations of particles .",
    "evolution of particles density @xmath36 satisfies the following equation :    @xmath37    if accelerations are independent from @xmath36 , ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) are equations of characteristics of ( 17 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the system is equation of movement of particles - the second newton s law :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 - particles mass , the force @xmath40 is the same as in ( 2 - 3 ) , ( 12 ) .",
    "we accept ( 13 ) as constraint on @xmath36 and try to get expression for constraints on accelerations @xmath41 .",
    "( 13 ) implies    @xmath42    @xmath43    this means , that averages of @xmath36 derivatives on space and time coordinates are zero .",
    "let us integrate ( 17 ) on velocities and use ( 20 ) .",
    "we get identity :    @xmath44    but we know , that average velocity @xmath45 is equal to    @xmath46    therefore ( 22 ) is similar to ( 7 ) - the divergence of average velocity field is zero .",
    "we can write this in the following way :    @xmath47    this identity concerns the first moments of derivatives of @xmath36 on space coordinates .",
    "they are not zero , but their sum is zero .",
    "let us multiply ( 17 ) by @xmath48 and integrate the result by parts :    @xmath49    let us integrate ( 25 ) on velocities .",
    "we get expression for average accelerations ( compare this with ( 5 ) )    @xmath50    let us denote    @xmath51    where @xmath52 - components of stresses tensor .",
    "so ( 26 ) reads    @xmath53    this is very remarkable , that average acceleration is not equal to acceleration of average motion and contain additional term - divergence of stresses tensor .",
    "this follows from the fact , that accelerations are quadratic on velocities .",
    "we shall use ( 27 ) to get constraint expression .    integrate newton s law ( 18 ) and get :    @xmath54    \\(27 ) and ( 28 ) imply equations of movement :    @xmath55    the gauss functional without constraints has the following form    @xmath56    to get expression for constraint on accelerations we take divergence of ( 27 ) ( compare with ( 9 ) ) .",
    "@xmath57    the first term in the rhs of ( 31 ) is zero according to ( 21 ) .",
    "the rest terms give us the desired constraint expression :    @xmath58 dv_1 dv_2 dv_3 = 0 .",
    "\\eqno ( 32)\\ ] ]    we multiply ( 32 ) by @xmath59 and add the result to ( 31 ) .",

    "the euler s equation for ( 33 ) is :    @xmath63    this means , that reaction of constrains is really equivalent to pressure field and we return to ( 12 ) and ( 14 ) once again .",
    "now let us consider the form of ( 13 - 14 ) system in the curvilinear coordinates . we need not perform all calculations here , because we can refer for details to our previous works [ 1 - 2 ] .",
    "therefore we give here only results of calculations .",

    "only in this section we discuss the case of nonzero force field . in this case equation ( 14 ) reads    @xmath96    where @xmath97 are components of force acting on particle . for non potential forces",
