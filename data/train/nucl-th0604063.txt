    "one of the main goals of physics with modern accelerators is the detailed investigation of the response of the nuclei@xcite to large momentum transfers of around or above @xmath0 . in particular , here the lightest nucleus , i.e. the deuteron , is a preferred object due to its well known nuclear structure@xcite . in recent years many investigations with the deuteron as a target",
    "have been performed at large momentum transfers with proton@xcite and electron beams@xcite ; further studies with deuteron beams have been@xcite or will be performed@xcite in the near future . here",
    "the deuteron as a spin 1 object is very special , as it allows to measure in addition to the total and differential cross section and the analyzing power also the tensor polarization of deuteron beams@xcite .",
    "it is hoped  and that explains the genuine interest  that high momentum transfer processes reveal details of the short range reaction mechanism and of the deuteron itself , which are expected at momentum transfers up to the low @xmath1 region to be dominated by meson exchange currents@xcite and the excitation of baryon resonances@xcite .",
    "+ in most calculations the deuteron is conventionally described as an object in rest with standard s and d wave components .",
    "however it is clear that with increasing momenta or momentum transfers on the deuteron this picture has to be modified : in coordinate space a moving deuteron is quenched along its axis of motion . as a consequence the deformation of the deuteron is increasing with increasing momenta which leads to a significant modification and enhancement of the deuteron spectrum at high momentum components .",
    "this , as expected , will modify substantially predictions of observables , which depend sensitively on large momenta components of the deuteron .",
    "+ in standard calculations the quenching of the deuteron is frequently not included , instead one uses approximate descriptions , such as to go to the breit frame for the deuteron form factor@xcite , in order to hopefully minimize the error due to the approximation .",
    "+ in this note we investigate the quenching of a moving deuteron in a simple model . in chapter 2",
    "we start from the manifest covariant bethe - salpeter equation@xcite and solve , after projecting onto 3 dimensions , a still covariant quasi potential equation@xcite for an harmonic oscillator potential of the deuteron with the goal to obtain analytical solutions .",
    "these solutions are then derived explicitly within a few approximations for the d - state of the deuteron , and presented in chapter 3 , together with characteristic results for the deuteron wave function in momentum space ; subsequently we apply the same prescription to a realistic deuteron wave function from the bonn potential .",
    "finally we close in chapter 4 with a summary and some remarks to improve of the approach .",
    "in this chapter we derive for a given kinematics the quasi potential equation for the deuteron from a blankenbecler - sugar projection of the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) .      for the deuteron with the total momentum @xmath2 and the relative momentum @xmath3 between the two nucleons",
    "the bse is given as @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the kernel of the bse and @xmath6 the nucleon mass .",
    "the total 3-momentum @xmath7 is specified along the z - axis , i.e. @xmath8 , while the 4-momentum @xmath2 is given by @xmath9 with the total energy of the deuteron given as @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the deuteron mass ) . to simplify the complicated spinor structure of @xmath12 , which is a 16 component spinor , we neglect in @xmath13 and @xmath14 the binding energy of the deuteron @xmath15 , and put the two nucleons on the mass shell ; then @xmath16 ( this corresponds in keeping only the large components in each of the dirac spinors of the two nucleons ) . with this approximation the bse",
    "is simplified drastically to @xmath17      as the bse can  except for separable potentials and a few academic cases  only be solved numerically , we simplify the problem by a reduction of the bse to a 3-dimensional , but still covariant quasi - potential equation ( qpe ) by restricting the nonstatic effects in the bse . unfortunately the transition from 4 to 3 dimensions is not unique : there exists an infinite number of qpe@xcite .",
    "thus we have to invoke  guided by the underlying physics ",
    "plausible arguments for the reduction of the bse . as the two nucleons in the deuteron are expected to exhibit a symmetrical dependence on the fourth component of internal momentum @xmath3 , we put them , following the arguments of blankenbecler and sugar@xcite , in their greens function @xmath18 symmetrically off their mass shell @xmath19 where the @xmath20-function can be solved for the @xmath21-component to give @xmath22 as a consequence the greens function is now reduced to @xmath23 which depends explicitly on the external momentum @xmath24 of the deuteron",
    ". we verify that in the limit of a deuteron in rest , i.e. @xmath25 the denominator @xmath26 in the greens function recovers the standard non relativistic structure @xmath27 in this picture the full deuteron greens function in the qp limit is then given dropping terms quadratic in @xmath28 , as @xmath29 with these steps the structure of the qpe is , for a given interaction kernel @xmath5 , completely specified ( the final expression for the qpe is given in the following chapter 3 ) .",
    "in this chapter we derive the structure of the momentum dependent harmonic kernel and present the solution of the corresponding qpe both for the central and the tensor piece of the deuteron wave function in momentum space .",
    "as already mentioned we use for the potential of the deuteron an harmonic kernel , in order to end up with analytical solutions of the qpe .",
    "thus we start from the four - dimensional form @xmath30 or its fourier transform @xmath31 to reduce the 4 dimensional @xmath20-function to a 3-dimensional form we start from the representation@xcite @xmath32 or , upon performing the bs - projection @xmath33 so that the harmonic interaction kernel @xmath34 reads with the notation @xmath35",
    "@xmath36      for a deuteron in rest the total wave function of the deuteron is given schematically as a combination of s and d wave pieces @xmath37    thereby @xmath38 and @xmath39 define the strength of the s and d - wave , which depend on the underlying nucleon - nucleon potential ; with the tensor operator @xmath40 , this yields in a coupled form @xmath41 ^ 1]^ { 1m}+c_dr_d(q)[y_2(\\hat{\\underline{q}})[\\tfrac{1}{2}\\tfrac{1}{2}]^1]^{1m}\\right)[\\tfrac{1}{2}\\tfrac{1}{2}]^{0,0}\\ ] ] with radial functions @xmath42 ( the coupled form @xmath43^{0,0}$ ] denotes the isospin content of the deuteron ) . in the following",
    "we discuss the solution for the s and the d - wave separately .      with the steps given above",
    ", we obtain from eqs .",
    "( 8,15 ) and with the additional notation @xmath44 the final equation for the s - wave in momentum space @xmath45 note that the notion s - wave is somewhat misleading , as the motion of the deuteron along the z - axis breaks the rotational symmetry of the standard s - wave component and introduces angular momenta @xmath46 .",
    "+ the solution of eq . ( 18 ) is easily obtained , following standard text books .",
    "going over to cartesian coordinates with @xmath47 + we obtain with the notation @xmath48 the final equations @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 ) .",
    "then the solution for the radial part is given as @xmath51 ( @xmath52 are normalization constants ) .",
    "the modification of the momentum spectrum along the z - axis is easily seen in comparison with a deuteron in rest : comparing with the solution of the spherical harmonic oscillator @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the common oscillator parameter , we find from @xmath55 immediately an enhancement of the z - components of a deuteron in flight or , correspondingly , a quenching of the z - component of the deuteron in coordinate space .",
    "the d - state component of a deuteron in flight is more complex than the corresponding s - state .",
    "a rigorous solution , even for an harmonic kernel , can be obtained only numerically , as the tensor operator couples longitudinal and perpendicular momentum components .",
    "we suppress this coupling by the assumption that in @xmath56 ^ 2]^{0,0}\\ ] ] for @xmath57  the case we are most interested in  the unit vector for the total momentum is directed along the z - axis ( with @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) then only the terms @xmath60 and @xmath61 without an explicit dependence on the angular momentum enter in the decoupled radial equations for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "consequently we end up , after separating into cartesian coordinates , with the radial equations @xmath64 for the x , y and z components ( following the notation for the s - state equation in 3.3 ) .",
    "the solutions of these differential equations are readily obtained : the general equation @xmath65 is reduced with suitable substitutions @xmath66 to the differential equation for bessel functions @xmath67 with the corresponding regular solution @xmath68 ( @xmath69 is a bessel function of first kind . )      in this section we present typical results from the formalism derived in the proceeding sections .",
    "thereby we focus on the momentum spectrum of the s and d - state , as here the influence of the quenching of a deuteron in flight is seen most clearly . to model our static deuteron we use an oscillator parameter @xmath70 as a typical scale ( of course we are aware that the representation of deuteron wave function as an harmonic oscillator with a single size parameter is an inadequate representation for a realistic comparison ) .",
    "typical results are given in fig .",
    "1(a , b ) for the s and d - wave momentum spectrum respectively .",
    "we find that at momenta around @xmath71 for a deuteron with a longitudinal momentum of @xmath71  a typical momentum anticipated for the deuteron beam of cosy  , the spectrum both in the s and d - wave is enhanced by typically one order of magnitude .",
    "in addition , the spherical symmetry in the s - state is increasingly broken with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "this is most readily seen in coordinate space , where one obtains upon the corresponding fourier transform    fig .",
    "momentum spectrum of the s - wave of the deuteron for different external momenta @xmath24 .",
    "1b . as fig .",
    "1a , however for the d - wave of the deuteron .",
    "@xmath72    or , if we introduce explicitly angular momentum functions , @xmath73 clearly , as easily seen from an expansion of the exponential function , for @xmath74 the s - state wave function for a deuteron contains in principle an infinite sum of even angular momentum components ; spin - orbital coupling admixes an additional l=2 component for the s - state wave function .",
    "a similar qualitative argument holds also for the d - state ( quantitatively , it differs by the additional coupling of @xmath75 from the structure of the d - state in the static deuteron ) .",
    "momentum spectrum of the s - wave of the deuteron for different external momenta @xmath24 .",
    "2b . as fig .",
    "2a , however for the d - wave of the deuteron .",
    "we extent our results for an harmonic kernel to deuteron wave functions from modern nn potentials , using the recipe @xmath76 explicitly for the deuteron wave function from the bonn potential .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "2(a , b ) for the s and the d - state of the deuteron .",
    "qualitatively , the resulting pattern - the enhancement of the @xmath62 spectrum for @xmath77 - is similar as for an harmonic kernel , though quantitatively such a modification is less pronounced , as already for a deuteron in rest the bonn potential significantly enhances the high momentum spectrum of the deuteron wave function relative to an harmonic potential .",
    "in this note we investigate the momentum spectrum of a deuteron in flight .",
    "starting from the bse and following the procedure of blankenbecler and sugar , we derive a 3-dimensional qpe for the deuteron . introducing an harmonic kernel for the binding of the deuteron",
    ", we solve the corresponding equation for the s and d - state of the deuteron analytically .",
    "+ as the main result we find , that for the longitudinal component ( along the external momentum @xmath24 ) the momentum spectrum , if compared with a deuteron in rest or with the perpendicular components , is substantially modified with increasing @xmath24 : the high momentum components are significantly enhanced , as expected from the quenching of the deuteron in coordinate space along the direction of motion .",
    "this is not surprising , as even in the s - state the spherical symmetry is broken for @xmath78 and higher partial waves @xmath79 modify the s - state ( with @xmath80 for a deuteron in rest ) , whereas the conventional d - state develops in addition an l=0 component .",
    "thus the deuteron gets more and more deformed with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "+ from the quantitative point of view our results are certainly preliminary : clearly our approach has to be based on a more realistic interaction kernel for comparison with a deuteron in rest , by taking the deuteron wave function or deuteron form factors from modern nucleon - nucleon potentials@xcite .",
    "a simple , but still approximate description is to fit for example the elastic deuteron form factor for a deuteron in rest by a set of gaussians with different size parameters along the results in chapter 3 ( the result is then still analytical ) .",
    "a more rigorous step would be to solve d - quenching for a kernel from modern nucleon - nucleon potentials , at the expense however , to end up with a complicated system of coupled differential equations due to the coupling of longitudinal and perpendicular components for @xmath81 , which can be solved only numerically , so that the transparency of the analytical solution is lost .",
    "in addition it has to be stressed that lorentz boosts in the instant form are dynamical and involve the underlying interaction@xcite ( opposite to kinematical boots on the light cone @xcite ) ; thus there exist different prescriptions for their incorporation @xcite,@xcite .",
    "experimentally , detailed information on lorentz boosts of the deuteron will result a systematic study of pd and , in particular , dp reactions at cosy , where a ( polarized ) deuteron beam will be available in the very near future@xcite .",
