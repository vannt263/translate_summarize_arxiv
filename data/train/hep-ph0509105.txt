    "at least within the context of einsteinian ( or , indeed , newtonian ) gravity , evidence for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) is overwhelming .",
    "this goes back to oort and zwicky , who showed in the 1930 s that there must be dark matter in our galaxy and in distant clusters of galaxies , respectively @xcite .",
    "later measurements of the total dm density , using ever larger systems , as well as improved determinations of the total baryon content of the universe from analyses of big bang nucleosynthesis , implied that most of the dm must be non  baryonic .",
    "this was confirmed recently by analyses of data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , in particular by the wmap satellite , as well as other data on the large scale structure of the universe , which allowed to determine many cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision @xcite .",
    "one should be aware , however , that these determinations are quite indirect , and hence rely on a host of assumptions about the history of the universe .",
    "in particular , one has to assume a rather simple form of the primordial power spectrum , as predicted by simple models of inflation . while these assumptions seem rather reasonable to me",
    "( see @xcite for a more contrarian view ) , and lead to an overall quite satisfactory ( though not perfect ) description of all existing data , it is certainly possible that these assumptions are not quite correct . in this talk",
    "i will therefore use a rather conservative ( nominal ) 3@xmath0 error band for the quantity of interest here , @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the dm mass density in units of the critical density , and @xmath3 is the scaled hubble constant ; observations imply @xmath4 with @xmath5 error .",
    "the combination @xmath6 is relevant , since this quantity can most easily be computed theoretically .",
    "these calculations start from the assumption that the dm particles @xmath7 once were in full thermal ( i.e. , both kinetic and chemical ) equilibrium with sm particles .",
    "this requires the universe to once have been hotter than about @xmath8 .",
    "since the equilibrium @xmath7 number density is suppressed exponentially by the boltzmann factor for @xmath9 , the rate @xmath10 of reactions that produce can produce dm particles ; the density of such energetic sm particles is suppressed by the same boltzmann factor . ] or destroy dm particles would eventually have become smaller than the expansion rate @xmath11 . at this point",
    "the dm particles are said to decouple . under the assumption that the universe evolved adiabatically after @xmath7 decoupling",
    ", one finds for today s dm density @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 denotes thermal averaging , @xmath14 is the relative velocity of two annihilating @xmath7 particles in their cms frame , and @xmath15 is the effective annihilation cross section of two @xmath7 particles into sm particles ; in the absence of co  annihilation ( see below ) this is nothing but the usual annihilation cross section @xmath16 , summed over all final states @xmath17 that only contain sm particles .",
    "note that the constant of proportionality in eq.([md_2 ] ) is inversely proportional to the hubble parameter at decoupling .",
    "in standard cosmology , decoupling occurs when the universe was radiation dominated , so that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of effective ( relativistic ) degrees of freedom and @xmath20 is the planck mass . in this case eq.([md_2 ] ) leads to a relic density in the range ( [ md_1 ] ) for roughly weak  scale cross section , i.e. @xmath7 should be a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .    under the stated reasonable assumptions  of a sufficiently hot , adiabatically evolving universe containing essentially only sm particles",
    "after the dm particles decoupled  we have succeeded in reducing the problem of calculating the dm relic density to a problem of calculating cross sections .",
    "this requires choosing a particle physics model for @xmath7 . here",
    "i will assume that @xmath7 is the lightest neutralino @xmath21 , which is the only possible dm candidate in the visible sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite .",
    "from the particle physics point of view , this is the by far best motivated wimp candidate . in the next section",
    "i will survey the dm  allowed regions of msugra parameter space , with special focus on two quite different scenarios : a bino  like neutralino annihilating mostly through exchange of the light cp  even higgs boson , and a heavy higgsino  like neutralino .",
    "then i will briefly comment on non  minimal scenarios , before presenting my conclusions .",
    "the msugra model @xcite allows to describe the entire spectrum of superparticles and higgs bosons by four continuous parameters and a sign , @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the common ( running ) soft susy breaking scalar mass , taken at scale @xmath24 gev where the sm gauge couplings meet ; @xmath25 is the common ( running ) gaugino mass at that scale ; @xmath26 is the common ( running ) trilinear scalar soft breaking parameter , also taken at scale @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two neutral higgs fields present in the mssm , taken at the weak scale ; and @xmath29 is the supersymmetric higgs(ino ) mass parameter is fixed by the requirement of proper electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the sign of @xmath29 is not scale dependent . ] .",
    "the parameters in ( [ md_3 ] ) determine the spectrum of physical masses through a set of renormalization group equations , as well as `` threshold '' loop corrections to translate running into pole masses . in the results presented below these are calculated using the suspect program package @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum has to pass several constraints before being accepted as a possible description of nature .",
    "these include collider ( chiefly lep ) limits on the production of superparticles and higgs bosons , radiative @xmath30 and @xmath31 decays , and the dm constraint ( [ md_1 ] ) , interpreted as described in the discussion of eq.([md_2 ] ) .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "examples of scans of the msugra parameter space are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the black regions are excluded by theoretical constraints ( in particular , by the requirement that the lightest superparticle , which is stable , must not be charged ) , as well as by the searches for sparticles .",
    "the pink regions are excluded by searches for neutral higgs bosons at lep .",
    "these lep data show some ( weak ) evidence for the existence of an sm  like higgs boson with mass near 114 gev ; the msugra regions that can explain this small excess of higgs  like events are shown in red .",
    "the blue region is favored by recent measurements @xcite of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , if data from hadron production at @xmath32 colliders are used to predict the sm contribution ; in this case a positive susy contribution is required at the @xmath33 level . however ,",
    "if instead hadronic @xmath34 decay data are used to evaluate the sm prediction , the data are compatible with a vanishing , or even small negative , susy contribution to @xmath35 .",
    "the green region is excluded by the measured branching ratio for radiative @xmath30 decays .",
    "as argued in @xcite , this bound is somewhat suspect ; it can certainly be circumvented without affecting collider ( or dm ) phenomenology @xcite .",
    "this region is therefore shown behind , rather than in front of , the other regions . finally , in the yellow regions the @xmath21 relic density lies in the desired range ( [ md_1 ] ) .",
    "the results shown in fig .  1 broadly agree with those of other recent msugra scans @xcite .",
    "one recognizes several distinct regions with correct dm relic density . in the _ bulk region _ @xcite slepton masses are sufficiently small to allow a large @xmath36 cross section .",
    "however , this region is getting squeezed severely by higgs searches at lep . in the _",
    "@xmath37 co  annihilation region _",
    "@xcite the @xmath38 mass splitting is so small that co ",
    "annihilation processes like @xmath39 have to be included in the calculation of the effective lsp annihilation cross section @xcite , since they also reduce the total number of superparticles in the early universe .",
    "this increases the effective annihilation cross section in eq.([md_2 ] ) by about one order of magnitude .",
    "these regions lie close to the lower black regions in fig .  1",
    ". the _ @xmath40pole region _",
    "@xcite is characterized by @xmath41 , so that lsp annihilation is enhanced by the near  resonant exchange of the cp ",
    "odd higgs boson @xmath42 in the @xmath43channel . in msugra",
    "this can only be realized at large @xmath28 , since the contribution from the @xmath44 yukawa coupling , which scales like @xmath45 , is essential for reducing @xmath46 through renormalization group running @xcite . at large @xmath47",
    "one finds the _ focus point _",
    "@xcite or _ hyperbolical branch _",
    "@xcite region , where the lsp has a sizable or even dominant higgsino component .",
    "the location of this region depends very strongly on the precise value of the top mass .",
    "pole region in the @xmath48 plane of msugra parameter space , for @xmath49 gev , @xmath50 gev , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "notation is as in fig .  1 .",
    "]    finally , upon closer inspection you will see small dm  allowed regions at @xmath53 to 3 tev and @xmath25 close to its lower bound ( which essentially comes from chargino searches at lep ) . in these regions of parameter space",
    "the @xmath21 annihilation cross section is enhanced by the near  resonant exchange of the light cp  even higgs boson @xmath3 .",
    "this region has therefore been called the _ @xmath54pole region _ in @xcite .",
    "it featured prominently in pre ",
    "lep2 msugra scans ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but then was squeezed almost out of existence by higgs and chargino searches . it has recently been resurrected @xcite by improved calculations of @xmath55 , as well as by the somewhat increased central value of the top mass ( which , however , shows a very recent tendency of falling again , if preliminary data @xcite are to be trusted ) . for @xmath49 gev , the @xmath54 pole region requires @xmath56 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( h-{\\rm pole    \\ region}).\\ ] ] however , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , it covers quite a substantial area in the @xmath48 plane for @xmath57 gev .",
    "bounds on physical ( pole ) masses might be a more meaningful way to show the possibilities of msugra than the ubiquitous plots of allowed regions in the space of basic input parameters ( [ md_3 ] ) .",
    "for one thing , these plots always fix the values of other free parameters .",
    "usually @xmath58 is chosen , but nonvanishing values of @xmath26 can have quite significant impact on allowed spectra @xcite .",
    "similarly , the current error on the top quark mass is still significant .",
    "varying @xmath59 in its 90% c.l . interval ( according to @xcite ) moves around the lower bounds on @xmath23 or @xmath25 from higgs searches by hundreds of gev ; the shift of the focus point / hyperbolical branch region is even bigger .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath28 is still almost completely unconstrained , apart from the lower bound @xmath60 that follows from higgs searches in msugra ( for stop masses below 2 tev ) .",
    "as well known @xcite , the sparticle spectrum for models with large @xmath28 looks quite different from that for low or moderate values of @xmath28 , with quite drastic impact on collider physics @xcite .",
    "one obtains the least biased view of the allowed ranges of masses by simply scanning over the entire parameter set that is consistent with a given set of constraints .",
    "not all constraints should be treated on an equal footing .",
    "lower bounds on masses ( or cross sections or branching ratios ) from accelerator  based experiments are most robust , since both beam and detector are well controlled by the experimenter ( i hope ) .",
    "bounds on masses and tree ",
    "level cross sections usually also do nt have many theoretical ambiguities .",
    "bounds on processes that only occur at quantum level , like @xmath61 decays or the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , are already somewhat less robust , since here in general several diagrams contribute , which opens the possibility of cancellations .",
    "more generally , one can often evade those bounds by relatively minor modifications of the model . in case of @xmath62 ,",
    "there s an additional ambiguity due to the @xmath63 discrepancy between sm ` predictions ' based on different data sets , as mentioned in the discussion of fig .  1 .    including the dm constraint ( [ md_1 ] )",
    "is fine in principle , since the existence of dm really has been established beyond reasonable doubt in the framework of msugra or similar models .",
    "however , translating this into a bound on model parameters , or on physical masses , is far from trivial .",
    "the usual procedure @xcite is to take eq.([md_2 ] ) at face value . however , as discussed in the introduction , this means that one accepts a set of assumptions about the early universe that are presently untested , and indeed are difficult to test except through dark matter physics .",
    "nevertheless , since these assumptions are indeed reasonable , it makes sense to try and see where they lead us .",
    "it was hoped originally that the upper bound on the dm relic density ( the so  called ` overclosure ' constraint ) would allow to establish reliable , useful upper bounds on sparticle masses .",
    "eq.([md_2 ] ) shows that the relic density goes like the inverse of the ( effective ) @xmath21 annihilation cross section , which in turn ( through dimensional arguments , or by unitariy @xcite ) goes like the inverse square of the relevant mass scale .",
    "indeed , unitarity does allow to establish an upper bound on the mass of any wimp ; however , this bound exceeds 100 tev @xcite , and is thus not particularly useful , since we lack the means to build colliders that could cover this kind of mass range . in the context of msugra",
    ", it became clear quite early on @xcite that very , even `` unnaturally '' , large masses can be compatible with the dm constraint ( [ md_1 ] ) even in standard cosmology .",
    ".sparticle mass bounds in msugra .",
    "these have been obtained by scanning over the entire allowed parameter space , defined by @xmath64 , \\ ( m_{\\tilde t_1 } + m_{\\tilde t_2})/2 \\leq 2 $ ] tev , the lower bounds on sparticle and higgs masses from collider experiments , the constraint on @xmath61 implemented as in @xcite , simple ` ccb ' constraints @xcite , and a conservative interpretation of the constraint from @xmath62 ( essentially the overlap of the @xmath65 regions using @xmath34 decay and @xmath32 collider data @xcite ) .",
    "set ii adds the dm constraint ( [ md_1 ] ) , implemented using ( [ md_2 ] ) , to the above set of constraints .",
    "set iii is like set ii , except that the scanned region as been artifically limited to the @xmath54pole region , where @xmath66 .",
    "only _ lower _ bounds are listed for sets i and ii , while for set iii the allowed range is given ; a dash (  ) means that the upper bound is directly set by the arbitrary upper bound on the average stop mass . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     nevertheless it is clear from figs .  1 and 2 that this constraint does exclude very large chunks of otherwise allowed parameter space",
    ". one might therefore think that it would at least affect the lower bounds on sparticle masses significantly .",
    "the table below shows that this is not really the case .",
    "this table lists lower bounds on the masses of some new ( s)particles in msugra , first without ( set i ) and then with ( set ii ) including the dm constraint . in particular , the lower bounds on many new ( s)particles simply coincide with the bounds established by collider experiments .",
    "this is true for the lighter chargino , stau and scalar higgs states , and essentially also holds true for the lighter stop .",
    "the bounds on the masses of the gluino and third neutralino are essentially the same as that in a more general mssm , as long as gaugino mass unification is maintained .",
    "clearly the dm constraint still allows some new ( s)particles to be quite light !",
    "i should emphasize , however , that usually the lower bounds in the table can not be saturated simultaneously .",
    "e.g. the lower bounds on electroweak gaugino masses are saturated at @xmath67 tev , where first generations squarks and sleptons are quite heavy . nevertheless , the possibility of light sparticles even in this simplest of all potentially realistic susy models that allow wimp dark matter should be quite encouraging to experimenters !",
    "set iii shows these bounds ( including the dm constraint ) when one confines oneself to the @xmath54pole region discussed at the end of the previous subsection . in this case",
    "there are significant upper bounds on the masses of all gauginos .",
    "the reason is that one needs @xmath68 gev here . since @xmath69 and @xmath70 in msugra ( due to the assumed universality of gaugino masses at the gut scale ) , one finds quite stringent upper bounds on the masses of the lighter chargino and gluino .",
    "these bounds can be tested at the tevatron , if it manages to collect several fb@xmath71 of data ; testing the gluino mass bound at the lhc is essentially trivial . on the negative side , we see that most scalars have to be quite heavy in this region .",
    "this is required to satisfy the @xmath3 search limit from lep with small @xmath25 .      in the last subsection i imposed the naturalness constraint that the average stop mass",
    "should not exceed 2 tev .",
    "if this constraint is relaxed , the deep hyperbolical branch region becomes allowed . for @xmath72 tev ( for @xmath49 gev ) one finds @xcite dm  allowed points where the lsp is an almost pure higgsino with mass near 1 tev @xcite .",
    "this region is impossible to probe even at the lhc , since squark and gluino masses lie near 10 tev or even higher ; in fact , @xmath23 and @xmath25 could even be exponentially larger than the weak scale !",
    "a decisive test will therefore have to make do with the three relatively light sparticles , i.e. , the three higgsino  like states @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "currently the best bet for producing these sparticles in detectable quantities seems to be the futuristic @xmath32 collider clic @xcite , which may operate at center  of  mass energy @xmath75 tev .",
    "however , since the mass splittings between these higgsino states amount to at most a few gev , detecting them will not be straightforward .",
    "the reason is that one expects large fluxes of beamstrahlung photons at future @xmath32 colliders , which tend to get worse with increasing beam energy and increasing luminosity .",
    "( note that the luminosity should exceed that of lep by a factor of order @xmath76 to produce a useful number of @xmath32 annihilation events . )",
    "this flux might be so large that each annihilation event is accompanied by an `` underlying event '' consisting of one or more soft @xmath77 hadrons reactions @xcite .",
    "this can be overcome by demanding that the higgsinos are produced together with a hard photon , that is emitted at large angle to the beam .",
    "a background event would then have to contain a hard @xmath78 annihilation plus an underlying event that happens to look like the soft @xmath79 or @xmath80 decay products .",
    "a recent calculation @xcite indicates that this background ( and similar ones occurring at higher orders in electroweak couplings ) can be overcome , especially if longitudinally polarized beams are available .",
    "the small size of the dm  allowed parameter space in fig .  1 is occasionally taken as motivation to consider extensions of the msugra model .",
    "actually , a small allowed parameter space _ per so _ should not be considered to be problematic .",
    "new measurements , like the constraint ( [ md_1 ] ) , are bound to constrain the parameter space of any theory .",
    "in fact , ideally one wants to ( over)constrain the parameter space , so that it collapses to ( almost ) a point , as in qed ( considered here as interaction of electrons with photons , i.e. a 2 parameter theory ) .",
    "slightly more worrisome is perhaps the observation that almost everywhere in the dm  allowed msugra parameter space some particular relation between parameters is required to hold ( in the pole or co  annihilation regions ) , and/or one is close to the edge of the region excluded by consistency considerations : in the @xmath37 co  annihilation region one is close to the region where the @xmath81 would be lsp , leading to a forbidden charged stable particle , whereas the focus point / hyperbolical branch region is close to the edge of parameter space where consistent electroweak symmetry breaking no longer works .",
    "one might therefore ask whether more ` generic ' dm  allowed regions of parameter space exist in ( slight ) generalizations of msugra .",
    "the answer , i believe , is no .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .  3 , which shows the scaled dm relic density as function of one parameter , with all other parameters held fixed .",
    "starting point is an msugra scenario with @xmath49 gev , @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 gev , @xmath58 , @xmath51 and @xmath84 . on the red curve , which is actually still an msugra curve ,",
    "@xmath26 has been increased .",
    "this reduces the mass of the lighter stop eigenstate @xmath85 ; eventually @xmath86 co  annihilation @xcite sets in , reducing the relic density .",
    "alas , @xmath87 quickly _ undershoots _ the desired range , i.e. one gets the right relic density only for a very narrow range of values of @xmath26 .    ) is indicated by the light green band .",
    "demanding that the relic density falls in this band singles out a narrow sliver of the otherwise allowed range of the parameter @xmath88 that is being varied .",
    "see the text for further details . ]",
    "the situation is similar on the blue line , where i have increased both higgs soft breaking masses at the gut scale relative to the sfermion masses @xcite .",
    "this allows to reduce the value of @xmath89 at the weak scale , making the lsp more higgsino  like .",
    "however , again the relic density quickly falls below the desired range ; as we saw in the last subsection of the previous section , a higgsino  like lsp would need a mass near 1 tev to make a good thermal cdm candidate ; this is well above the lsp masses considered in fig .  3 .",
    "the dm constraint therefore again singles out a very narrow strip of the ( extended ) parameter space .",
    "note also that in this , as well as the previous , case the dm  allowed region is again quite close to the upper bound on the parameter that is being varied ( due to the experimental bound on @xmath90 and on @xmath91 , respectively ) .",
    "the dark green curve is for a model where gaugino masses are not universal at the gut scale @xcite .",
    "specifically , i have kept @xmath92 , but reduced @xmath93 , making the lsp more wino  like .",
    "unfortunately the curve yet again falls quickly through the desired range of relic density , i.e. the dm constraint is again satisfied only in a narrow sliver of parameter space ; in this case the allowed region is not close to the edge , though .    on",
    "can also consider generalizing the cosmological framework .",
    "all curves in fig .  3 still use the standard assumptions ( sufficiently high temperature , only sm particles contribute to the hubble expansion , no entropy production after decoupling of the lsp ) .",
    "for example , a quintessence field could significantly alter the hubble parameter during decoupling .",
    "as far as i know , only scenarios with increased @xmath11 have been analyzed so far @xcite . in this case",
    "one can increase the relic density by a large factor , e.g. allowing higgsino dark matter with `` natural '' mass of a few hundred gev .",
    "however , one needs to tune the model to have a large change of @xmath11 during lsp decoupling and in the present period ( to account for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe ) , while keeping @xmath11 very close to its standard value during big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "another way to increase the lsp density is to assume that there were non  thermal production mechanisms @xcite .",
    "finally , if the lightest neutralino is long  lived but eventually decays into a very weakly coupled superparticle , e.g. an axino @xcite or gravitino @xcite , one automatically becomes more sensitive to details of early universe cosmology .",
    "the simplest assumption is that the decay of the neutralinos ( or whatever else is the lightest sparticle in the visible sector ) is the by far dominant contribution to the relic density of this superweakly interacting sparticle @xcite .",
    "however , in general there can be significant production of gravitinos or axinos also from the thermal bath @xcite .",
    "finally , there might again be additional non  thermal production mechanisms @xcite",
    ". scenarios with very weakly interacting dark matter particles therefore allow to make any point in the parameter space of msugra ( or similar models ) dm  compatible .",
    "if the lightest neutralino remains the lightest visible sparticle , these models often have exactly the same collider phenomenology as if @xmath21 indeed was the lsp .",
    "the constraint ( [ md_1 ] ) greatly constrains the parameter space of any particle physics model of dark matter .",
    "the msugra model still works fine , although some relation between parameters seems to be required .",
    "one ( resurrected ) possibility is @xmath94 ( the @xmath54pole region ) . more generally , in msugra the dm constraint does not increase lower bounds on sparticle and higgs masses significantly .",
    "very ( almost arbitrarily ) large gaugino and sfermion masses are allowed if the lsp is higgsino  like ; it might nevertheless be possible to test this region of parameter space at clic .",
    "generalizations of msugra allow to reduce the dm relic density , but generally do not increase the fraction of dm  allowed parameter space . finally ,",
    "if the lsp resides in the hidden sector , pretty much any visible sector spectrum can be made dm ",
    "safe , at the cost of predictivity and testability .",
    "i conclude that the dark matter constraint is a great tool for model builders , but should probably not be taken too seriously by collider physicists .",
