    "the experimental results come from many experiments such as , kamiokande , sage , gallex , gno , super - kamiokande , and sno for solar neutrino @xcite ; kamland for long - baseline reactor neutrino @xcite ; kamiokande , super - kamiokande , macro , and soudan-2 for atmospheric neutrino @xcite ; k2k for long - baseline accelerator neutrino @xcite ; and chooz and palo verde for short - baseline accelerator neutrino experiments @xcite .",

    "first of all , the observed dependence is much stronger compared to the dependence on @xmath34 ; this is expected due to the large impact of @xmath45 on the soft gaugino masses , which together with @xmath46 define the tree  level neutrino mass matrix .",
    "moreover , the susy spectrum has a large impact on the one  loop corrections increasing the sensitivity to @xmath45 .",
    "both solar and atmospheric squared mass differences are too large in the region of small gravitino masses , however , this region is already partially ruled out since it leads to charginos lighter than the present experimental bounds for @xmath47 tev .",

    "solutions are concentrated in a narrow band defined by @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 gev .",
    "we note that in brpv the lsp need not to be the lightest neutralino , since it is not stable anyway . for this reason ,",
    "the region close to @xmath62 is not ruled out .",
    "smaller values of @xmath59 are not possible because the atmospheric and solar mass differences become too large .",

    "[ x1_1 ] we plot the inverse of the partial decay width ( multiplied by the velocity of light to convert it into a distance ) as a function of the most relevant brpv parameters . in frame ( [ x1_1]a )",
    "we see the inverse of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , for all practical purposes , the decay rate into electrons depends _ only _ on @xmath68 .",
    "since in first approximation , the coupling is proportional to @xmath68 , the inverse of the decay rate behaves like @xmath69 , and this is seen in the figure .",
    "the values of @xmath68 are limited by the solar parameters .",
    "the inverse of the partial decay rate @xmath70 is of the order of @xmath71 , and it s an important part of the total decay rate .",
    "in frame ( [ x1_1]b ) we have the inverse of @xmath72 as a function of @xmath73 , and similarly to the previous case , the decay rate into muons depends practically only on @xmath73 . in our reference model in eq .",
    "( [ epslam ] ) we have @xmath74 , but values indicated in the figure are also compatible with neutrino physics .",
    "the coupling of the neutralino to @xmath75 and muon is proportional to @xmath73 , so the inverse of the decay rate goes like @xmath76 , and that is observed in frame ( [ x1_1]b ) .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath73 , the partial decay length vary from centimeters to kilometers in the figure .",
    "therefore , this partial decay rate contribute little to the total decay rate of the neutralino .    the inverse of @xmath77 is plotted in frames ( [ x1_1]c ) and ( [ x1_1]d ) as a function of @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "the dependence on @xmath78 is stronger and similarly to the previous cases it goes like @xmath80 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath79 is weaker , and the inverse decay rate increases with this parameter .",
    "the inverse decay rate is of the order of @xmath81 , making it the most important contribution to the total decay rate . including the decay modes into neutrinos and a @xmath82 , the total inverse decay rate is near @xmath83",
    ". the ratios of branching ratios for our benchmark point in eq .",
    "( [ epslam ] ) are given by @xmath84 we note that if we increase @xmath73 by a factor 4 , the first ratio of branching ratios increase to @xmath85 without changing the other ratio , while still passing all the experimental cuts . from this figure , it is clear that by measuring the branching ratios of the neutralinos we get information on the parameters of the model .",
    "we calculate the production cross sections @xmath86 ( lhc ) and @xmath87 ( ilc at @xmath88 gev ) at leading order , and using the branching ratios find @xmath89 with negligible background .",
    "assuming a luminosity of @xmath90 pb@xmath91/year at both machines , we expect @xmath92 signal event per year at the lhc and @xmath93 signal events per year at the ilc ( summing over lepton charges ) .",
    "supersymmetry with bilinear r - parity violation remains a viable mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses and mixing angles . in this model ,",
    "the neutralino is no longer a candidate to dark matter .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to understand the neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "a low energy seesaw mechanism gives mass to one neutrino due to the mixing with neutralinos , and quantum corrections give mass to the other two .",
    "we show examples on how this works in supergravity and amsb , indicating how this model can be tested in future colliders .",
