    "@xmath2    both the massive lepton pairs production in hadronic collisions ( drell - yan ) and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at high energy are the most outstanding processes probing the hadron structure . on the deep inelastic side ,",
    "a large amount of work has been done to describe the copious data at medium and very small bjorken scaling variable @xmath1 , based on perturbative qcd @xcite . in the high energy domain",
    "it has been found that important unitarity corrections should be taken into account regarding the standard pqcd approach @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are currently denominated perturbative shadowing or saturation effects @xcite . concerning the drell - yan sector ,",
    "the pqcd tools have produced a reasonable theoretical understanding of the main observables , despite the small data set available at present @xcite .",
    "the forthcoming accelerator experiments ( rhic and lhc ) will scan the high energy limit of the hadronic reactions and open a new kinematic window , i.e. smaller @xmath1 values .",
    "in particular , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a new state of the hadronic matter predicted by qcd , is expected to be found there @xcite . the theoretical description of the qgp production is directly associated to a complete knowledge on saturation effects and the transition region to the high parton densities . in a specific way ,",
    "since the production scheme for @xmath3 is similar to the drell - yan one and the latter does not contain final state effects , dy can be considered as a baseline process to study @xmath3 suppression as a signature of qgp formation @xcite .    in the fast proton system",
    ", the qcd factorization theorem leads to describe the hadronic processes through the convolution of the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) with the partonic subprocesses . the latter",
    "are completely calculated in pqcd up to higher orders , whereas only the evolution in the factorization scale of the pdf s is determined .",
    "namely , the parton distributions are solutions of the dglap evolution equations , whose formalism has been successful in describing both dis and dy data @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative way to study electron - proton and hadronic reactions is claimed by the color dipole picture considering the rest frame description based on @xmath4-factorization @xcite .",
    "thus , the basic blocks are the dipole light - cone wavefunction and the dipole - target cross section .",
    "such an approach has produced an unified way to study the mentioned processes , however its complete connection with the standard dglap formalism is not provided yet and deserves further studies .    in the infinite momentum frame",
    ", the dy process corresponds to the annihilation of a quark ( antiquark ) from the projectile with antiquark ( quark ) of the target into a virtual photon ( vector boson ) , which afterwards decays into a lepton pair @xcite . in the leading order ( lo )",
    "calculation , the dy process has a simple electromagnetic character and it can be promptly given by qed theory .",
    "however , the perturbative qcd results at higher orders modify this simple picture . at present ,",
    "pqcd calculations have been developed up to the second order of the strong coupling constant @xmath5 @xcite . for practical considerations ,",
    "in general the involved next orders contributions are taken into account by a phenomenological parameter , namely a @xmath6 factor which is dependent on the dy kinematic variables .    in the rest frame",
    ", the dy process looks like a bremsstrahlung of a virtual photon decaying into a lepton pair , rather than a parton annihilation @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung of the virtual photon can occur after or before the interaction with the gluonic field of the target .",
    "the advantage of this formalism is that the corresponding cross section can be considered in terms of the same dipole cross section extracted from small-@xmath1 dis in the color dipole picture @xcite . at high energy",
    ", the unitarity corrections should be included in the dipole cross section .",
    "such effects have been considered , for example , in the phenomenological model of g.biernat-wusthoff ( gbw ) @xcite , which describes dis and @xmath7 diffractive process with good agreement .",
    "we notice , however , that the unitarity corrections to the inclusive observables , i.e. total cross section or @xmath8 , can be hidden into the parametrization based on dglap approach , absorbed in the initial conditions , thus providing an excellent data description as seen in the updated nlo qcd fits @xcite .",
    "more exclusive observables should be useful to clarify this important aspect .",
    "after this short remark , we proceed our argumentation .",
    "the main disadvantage in gbw is that a dynamical explanation of the saturation phenomenon is lacking . on the other hand",
    ", the glauber - mueller approach provides a theoretical development concerning parton saturation @xcite , constraining the pqcd description of the dipole cross section . here , we make use of this formalism to perform a description of the dy process in the rest frame .",
    "the goal of this work is to perform a study of dy at high energies considering the color dipole picture , in a similar way of recent works @xcite .",
    "our contribution is based on the use of the dipole cross section calculated in perturbative qcd , through the glauber - mueller formula @xcite , which encodes the unitarity effects ( saturation ) in the parton densities .",
    "this approach takes into account the multiple pomeron scattering hypothesis in an eikonal way keeping the unitarity of the considered process . a comparison between the phenomenological gbw dipole cross section and the theoretical glauber - mueller one",
    "is presented , verifying that the two approaches have different behaviors at higher energies .",
    "this is due to the dynamical dependence on the gluon distribution in the glauber - mueller approach , whose born term recovers the dglap kernel in double log approximation ( dla ) .",
    "the nonperturbative region , i.e. large dipole sizes contributions , is addressed considering the freezing of the gluon distribution under the initial perturbative evolution scale @xmath9 .",
    "then , we present dy calculations in the rest frame of the target at leading order in a @xmath10 collision and perform a comparison with the low @xmath1 dy differential cross section from the e772 collaboration @xcite .",
    "we also produce estimates for the cross section at rhic energies .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following .",
    "in the next section we present a brief review of the dy process in the dipole color picture , discussing the range of validity for this approach and showing the role played by the @xmath11 wavefunction . in sec . ( 3 ) we present high parton density effects calculated from the glauber - mueller approach , and confront them with the phenomenological gbw model .",
    "we estimate the contribution of the saturation effects for the dipole cross section in high energies ( lhc and rhic ) . in sec .",
    "( 4 ) , a parameter - free prediction to the differential dy cross section for the available data at small-@xmath1 and estimates to rhic are performed .",
    "finally , in the last section the results are discussed and we present our conclusions .",
    "@xmath2    before the description of the drell - yan process in the rest frame , we would like to review the main kinematical variables and the standard calculations in the laboratory system .",
    "this is important to clarify the connection between them and to emphasize the asymmetry projectile - target in the rest frame picture .    in the laboratory system ,",
    "the lepton pairs are produced in the drell - yan reaction where partons from the projectile ( fast proton ) interact with the proton target @xcite .",
    "looking at the parton level , a quark - antiquark pair annihilates into a virtual photon in leading order @xmath12 .",
    "the symmetry between target and projectile is very clear , namely we can not distinguish a quark coming from the proton target or from the incoming beam .",
    "the momentum fraction carried by the quark from the projectile is labeled @xmath13 and from the target is @xmath14 .",
    "the partonic subprocess above is well known from qed , and the hadroproduction cross section is obtained folding the partonic cross section with the quark ( antiquark ) densities evaluated at the invariant @xmath15 , the squared lepton pair mass , chosen here as the factorization scale @xmath16 .",
    "their evolution in @xmath15 is given by the standard dglap evolution equations .",

    "the center of mass energy squared is @xmath21 and the usual notation is @xmath22 the momentum fractions are rewritten as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the longitudinal momentum fraction , labeled feynman @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath21 are the kinematic variables experimentally measured , whereas the partonic variables , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are reconstructed from them .",
    "when we consider the target at rest , the dy process looks like a bremsstrahlung : the quark from the projectile radiates a photon , which carries a fraction @xmath26 of the light - cone momentum of the initial quark , later decaying into the lepton pair [ see fig .",
    "the interaction with the target can occur before or after the photon emission .",
    "thus , although diagrammatically no dipole to be present , the interference among graphs results in a product of two quark amplitudes in the dy cross section , testing the external gluonic field at two different transverse positions @xcite . therefore , a remarkable feature emerging is that the @xmath27 interaction can be described by the same dipole cross section as in dis @xcite .    in the ( @xmath28 )",
    "mixed representation , the photoabsorbtion cross section in deep inelastic is described by the convolution of the wavefunctions , @xmath29 , from the virtual photon and the interaction dipole cross section , @xmath30 .",
    "the wavefunctions are considered taking into account the first photon fock state configuration , namely a @xmath31 pair .",
    "the dipole cross section is modeled phenomenologically based on a matching between the hard and soft pieces , constrained by the dis available data .",
    "the transverse separation of the @xmath31 pair is @xmath32 , and each quark ( or antiquark ) of the dipole carries a momentum fraction @xmath26 ( or @xmath33 ) , from the incoming photon .",
    "the small dipole size configurations can be described through pqcd , whereas the large size ones belong to the nonperturbative domain .",
    "hence , one can write the photoabsorption cross section as a function of the scaling variable @xmath1 and photon virtuality @xmath34 in the quantum mechanics form @xcite ,    @xmath35    where @xmath36 indicate the transverse and longitudinal contributions to the total cross section . in a similar way , the cross section for radiation of a virtual photon from a quark after scattering on a proton has the following factorized form in the color dipole picture @xcite @xmath37 where we have the same dipole cross section as in dis . here",
    "@xmath32 is the photon - quark transverse separation , @xmath38 is the @xmath31 separation and @xmath26 is the fraction of the light - cone momentum of the initial quark taken away by the photon .",
    "we notice the difference with the dis case , where the dipole separation is just @xmath32 . here , @xmath30 is the cross section for scattering a @xmath31 pair off a proton which depends on the @xmath31 transverse separation , and which should take into account the saturation effects at high energy .",
    "the physical interpretation of ( [ gplctotal ] ) is similar to dis in the light - cone approach ( lc ) .",
    "the projectile quark state is expanded in its fock space in the form @xcite , @xmath39 where here one has the expansion in terms of the eigenstates from the quark projectile . instead , in deep inelastic the expansion",

    "in contrast , evaluating the scalar product referred above in the target rest frame shows that the projectile quark carries momentum fraction @xmath57 ( which is larger than @xmath13 ) , of the parent hadron , and correspondingly , @xmath13 is the momentum fraction of the proton carried by the photon .",

    "this feature is depicted in the upper plot , for a small @xmath145 , where gm overestimates gbw by a factor two at intermediate @xmath146 .",
    "an immediate consequence from the plots is that our prediction lies lower than gbw at @xmath147 and higher for smaller @xmath14 .",
    "we discuss these features in a theoretical and phenomenological point of view when performing the comparison with available data in the next section .",
    "@xmath2 this section is devoted to perform theoretical predictions for the available data on dy process and the forthcoming ones from rhic or lhc . in the previous section",
    ", we presented a parameter - free glauber - mueller dipole cross section which matches leading log gluon evolution and contains corrections from unitarity effects ( parton saturation ) at higher energies .",
    "therefore , this provides a clear dynamical description of the observables depending on the gluonic content of the target , also when it is a nuclear one .",
    "although perturbative qcd provides reliable results at small distances ( small dipole sizes ) , the nonperturbative sector is still far from being completely understood .",
    "the usual pdf s are evolved from a perturbative initial scale @xmath148 gev@xmath130 , and there is little information about the behavior at @xmath149 , where the perturbative description is not even justifiable . in general",
    "one makes use of regge phenomenology to estimate those contributions ( see , for instance @xcite ) , and extrapolating to lower virtuality regions ( large dipole sizes ) one needs an ansatz regarding the nonperturbative sector .",
    "the use of the grv94 parametrization @xcite in our calculations , bearing in mind that @xmath150 , meaning its evolution initial scale is @xmath151 gev@xmath130 , allows to scan dipole sizes up to @xmath152 gev@xmath153 (= 0.62 fm ) .",
    "the cut off @xmath154 defines the transverse distance scale matching the perturbative and nonperturbative sector . for the most recent parametrizations , where @xmath155 gev@xmath130 ( @xmath156 fm ) the amount of nonperturbative contribution in the calculations should increase .",
    "an additional advantage is that grv94 does not include non - linear effects to the dglap evolution since the parametrization was obtained from rather large @xmath1 values .",
    "this feature ensures that the parametrization does not include sensible unitarity corrections ( perturbative shadowing ) in the initial scale .",
    "now , we should introduce an ansatz for the large transverse separation region .",
    "a more phenomenological way is to match the pqcd dipole cross section with the typical hadronic one @xmath157 at @xmath158 , for instance as performed in @xcite . nevertheless , due to the large growth of the pqcd dipole cross section at high energies and to take a more simple technical procedure we choose an alternative way : the gluon distribution is frozen at scale @xmath158 , namely @xmath159 .",
    "then , the large distance contribution @xmath160 reads as , @xmath161 in a more rigorous analyses , one should substitute the freezening scale @xmath162 for the saturation scale @xmath163 to take into account a realistic value of the gluon anomalous dimension in all kinematic regions .    concerning our ansatz for the large @xmath117 region , one verifies in ref .",
    "@xcite that it produces reasonable data description , mainly the normalization of the structure functions .",
    "an improvement for the non - perturbative contribution is performed there , where a cut off in the @xmath117 integration ( @xmath164 ) and the addition of a soft pomeron term are considered . however ,",
    "if we do not introduce this improvement , the normalization of the structure functions remains unaffected . for completeness",
    ", the consideration of a soft term for the non - perturbative contribution was also taken into account in ref .",
    "however , for the same reasons above , we choose the technically more simple procedure .    to illustrate the role played by the small and large transverse separations in the description of the observables , in fig .",
    "( [ rinteg ] ) one shows the profile of the @xmath32-integration from eq .",
    "( [ dycs ] ) as a function of the @xmath11 transverse separation @xmath32 at typical mass @xmath25 values .",
    "it is labeled here as @xmath165 .",
    "the momentum transfer is fixed at @xmath144 , since the low @xmath14 data available lie at this magnitude . for the proton structure function @xmath166 , describing the quark content of the projectile , we use the allm updated parametrization @xcite ( good agreement with hera data at large @xmath1 ) .",
    "both transverse and longitudinal profiles are presented .",
    "the main contribution for the profiles comes from the asymmetric peaks which are shifted to larger @xmath32 as @xmath25 diminishes .",
    "for instance , in the transverse profile , the peak lies at @xmath167 fm for @xmath168 gev whereas at @xmath169 gev it takes values @xmath170 fm . as it was verified in sec .",
    "( 2 ) , the longitudinal sector selects smaller transverse sizes @xmath32 than the transverse one .",
    "indeed , from the upper plot , non - zero contributions are obtained up to large @xmath171 fm .",
    "the higher twist character of the longitudinal piece is verified through the magnitude scale of @xmath172 . due to the fact that the nonperturbative sector dominates for @xmath173 fm using the grv input ,",
    "a significant part of the contributions comes from the soft region where @xmath26 is small ( soft quark ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectations that important soft contributions take place in drell - yan process ( see related discussions at @xcite ) .",
    "now , we are able to compare the results with the available data .",
    "since the color dipole picture is valid at small momentum fraction @xmath14 , one needs to select the experimental data covering this requirement .",
    "the lowest @xmath14 data were obtained in the fixed - target dimuon production at e772 collaboration @xcite , where we select the points with @xmath174 following the similar procedure of @xcite . in fig .",

    "the leading double - logarithmic asymptotics of such an amplitude was calculated in perturbative qcd in ref .",

    "@xcite , one considers the constant value @xmath187 ( to obtain a @xmath188 in gev@xmath124 ) .",

    "the color dipole result considering only the gluon content ( sea quarks ) , eq .",
    "( [ dipgm ] ) , lies below lo fast proton frame one at @xmath190 ( where the presented data are available ) .",
    "however , in this kinematical region the valence quark content competes with the sea one and such a difference should be expected .",
    "now , we introduce the valence content , parametrized in eq .",

    "( [ dipgm ] ) : as a result our data description has been improved , equivalently to the calculations in @xcite considering the gbw model .",
    "as @xmath14 decreases the gluonic content of the target drives the observables and the color dipole considering only eq .",
    "( [ dipgm ] ) should produce quite reliable results .",
    "we have verified this feature and have found that the reggeon contribution for the rhic energies is completely negligible .    here , some comments about higher order corrections are timely . the color dipole approach results for total ( virtual ) photon cross section are equivalent to those ones obtained by @xmath76-factorization @xcite in the leading logarithmic approximation . however , the inclusion of higher order effects in the @xmath76-factorization approach turns the equivalence incompatible : the conservation of the transverse positions and sizes of the colliding objects is violated @xcite .",
    "therefore , the introduction of higher orders contributions into the dipole cross section must be taken with some care .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "( [ dyrhic ] ) for the same fixed @xmath24 . there",
    ", the @xmath14 reaches values of order @xmath192 and unitarity effects are important .",

    "such a behavior is expected from our previous conclusions where gm overestimates gbw at smaller @xmath14 due to the growth of the gluon distribution at higher energies [ see the upper plot in fig .",
    "( [ relcsgmwus ] ) ] .",
    "concerning the rest frame non - corrected dglap input , the glauber - mueller underestimates them due to the significant corrections coming from unitarity effects ( parton saturation ) .",
    "moreover , we have obtained a result almost similar to the lo breit frame calculations at the rhic energies , suggesting a good consistency in both frameworks . from the plots one verifies that the deviations are more significant as @xmath25 diminishes , corresponding to smaller @xmath14 values . in absolute values ,",
    "the corrections at rhic energies reach up to @xmath193 % .    as final comments ,",
    "we address additional advantages of the color dipole picture in the dy case .",
    "for example , it allows to obtain the transverse momenta @xmath194 distribution for the process already at leading order calculation @xcite .",
    "instead , in the parton model the lepton pair has no transverse momentum due to the assumption that in the partonic subprocess the longitudinal momenta are bigger than the transverse ones ( partons are collinear ) .",
    "therefore , an alternative way to solve this trouble is to introduce an intrinsic @xmath194 for the initial state interacting partons .",
    "however , such an assumption is not sufficient to describe the measured @xmath194 distributions .",
    "considering the compton and the annihilation subprocess the leptons acquire transverse momentum and the @xmath194-dependence can be calculated in pqcd .",
    "the resummations produce @xmath195 terms which are large as the transverse momentum goes to soft values @xmath196 ( the perturbative expansion breaks down ) .",
    "thus , the color dipole description is a nice tool to calculate that distributions since the above difficulties are avoided .",
    "one intends to address carefully this issue in a next calculation .",
    "@xmath2    the drell - yan is an important process testing the quark ( antiquark ) content of the hadron target .",
    "the measured observables are lorentz invariant , whereas the parton description is frame dependent .",
    "calculations in the fast proton system have provided a perturbative understanding of dy up to higher orders . on the other hand",
    ", the color dipole picture allows a simple description of dy driven by the gluonic content ( sea quarks ) of the target .",
    "the quark from the projectile radiates a photon decaying into a lepton pair .",
    "the basic blocks in the color dipole are the lc wavefunctions and the dipole cross section .",
    "the former is calculated from perturbation theory and the latter one is modeled taking into account general properties of both hard and soft domains .",
    "we have found that the lc wavefunction for the @xmath0 configuration plays the role of a weight function for the different transverse separations @xmath32 ( as well as dipole sizes @xmath70 ) contribution to the process .",
    "namely , small transverse separations are selected by both the transverse and longitudinal pieces . however , the transverse contribution can select non - negligible large sizes @xmath32 . in addition ,",
    "larger invariant mass @xmath25 scans smaller @xmath0 separations .",
    "moreover , the longitudinal piece is higher twist ( suppressed by a factor @xmath74 ) .",
    "these features are also present in the deep inelastic case due to the similarity between the lc wavefunctions expressions .",
    "concerning the dipole cross section , here we consider the glauber - mueller approach , which takes into account the corrections to the standard dglap formalism due to the unitarity requirements .",
    "the taming of the parton distributions ( parton saturation ) at high energies is performed considering the multi - scattering assumption from the glauber - like ( eikonal ) formalism . we have found a distinct behavior at both low and large @xmath14 when performing a comparison with the phenomenological gbw model .",
    "the main source of the deviation is that gm depends on the gluon distribution , which increases as @xmath14 diminishes .",
    "these features produce distinct results at current energies and in the forthcoming measurements .",
    "an important verification is that a non - negligible amount of non - perturbative contribution is present in the cross section .",
    "although the lc wavefunctions suppress large transverse separations , a large cross section at small @xmath197 compensates the suppression producing significant soft content .",
    "the current low @xmath14 available data lie in values ranging from @xmath176 , actually testing the validity limit of the color dipole picture .",
    "our results considering only gm dipole cross section underestimate the experimental measurements since color dipole includes only the sea quark content ( gluon radiation ) from the target . in the realistic case , for this kinematical region the valence and sea quarks have both a significant contribution in the cross section .",
    "we have parametrized the valence content through a reggeon exchange and the results turn out equivalent to the data description claimed in ref .",
    "it was found also that issues related to higher orders contributions in the color dipole picture should be taken carefully .    as the energy reached in the forthcoming experiments increases , the saturation effects should turn out to be more relevant .",
    "we perform estimates for the rhic energies and have found that the unitarity corrections are important in the description of the cross section .",
    "we expect that such correction should be larger at lhc , since the @xmath14 values probed there would be smaller than in rhic .",
    "the quite simple scenario for dy process in the rest frame allows to extend the approach to the nuclear case and also get information on @xmath194 distribution .",
    "the higher energies soon available will demand a well established knowledge on the nuclear gluon distribution which can be the input for the nuclear dipole cross section in the color dipole framework .",
    "this approach should be a useful tool to perform pqcd estimates for the future experimental measurements .",
