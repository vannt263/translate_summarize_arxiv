    "we calculate that spt - cl  j0546 - 5345 , which at @xmath58 is already almost as massive as the coma cluster , will increase in mass by a factor of @xmath130 over the next 8 gyr .",
    "it should therefore grow into one of the most massive clusters in the universe by the present day .    historically , the existence of individual massive galaxy clusters at high redshift has been used to constrain cosmological models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while we are entering an era where large samples of sz clusters will soon be available in addressing such questions , it is interesting to ask whether the existence of spt - cl  j0546 - 5345is expected in our survey volume for a concordance @xmath131cdm cosmology",
    "convolving the @xcite mass function with a gaussian mass probability function for the best - estimate mass of spt - cl  j0546 - 5345 , we find that @xmath131cdm predicts the existence of @xmath132 clusters of this mass or higher at @xmath1 in 178 deg@xmath8 .",
    "we note that the @xmath133 relation was calibrated at lower redshifts ( @xmath134 ) than spt - cl  j0546 - 5345 , and the accuracy of this relation has not been verified at @xmath135 .",
    "given the caveats and uncertainties inherent in this calculation , we conclude that the existence of spt - cl  j0546 - 5345  in our survey volume is unsurprising .",
    "the complete spt sample , combined with improved mass scaling relations based on complementary mass measures , will permit @xmath131cdm predictions for the high end of the cluster mass function to be robustly tested at high redshift .",
    "we report the spectroscopic confirmation spt - cl  j0546 - 5345  at @xmath136 , the first sze - selected galaxy cluster at @xmath137 .",
    "we measure a robust velocity dispersion from 18 early - type members of @xmath138 km / s , corresponding to a dynamical mass of @xmath139 @xmath5 .",
    "spt - cl  j0546 - 5345  is the most dynamically massive cluster yet identified , from any method , at @xmath1 .",
    "we find excellent consistency across several independent mass measures . the measured dispersion and x - ray temperature of spt - cl  j0546 - 5345fall right on the @xmath10@xmath91 relation .",
    "the x - ray , sze and richness - based mass estimates are all consistent with the dynamical mass , and with each other , within the errors . combining all the mass measures , we derive a best - estimate mass for spt - cl  j0546 - 5345  of @xmath140 @xmath5 .    in @xmath131cdm",
    "we expect 0.18 clusters consistent with this mass above @xmath1 in our survey area . given the uncertainties in x - ray scaling relations at high redshift , we conclude that the existence of spt - cl  j0546 - 5345  in our survey volume is unsurprising",
