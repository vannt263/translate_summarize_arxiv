    "the imaging spectrometers aboard _ asca _ showed that the x  ray emission at energies @xmath25 kev in the region of the supernova remnant is dominated by the flux from the pulsar and compact nebula .",

    "rays from the crab , another young , isolated pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "the plerionic system psr 1509@xmath058/msh 15@xmath052 was observed by the high energy x  ray timing experiment ( hexte ) and the proportional counter array ( pca ) instruments aboard the _ rossi x  ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) satellite on a number of occasions in 1996 during both in - orbit checkout and the first observing period .",
    "the latter data consist of proprietary observations used in rots et al .",
    "the hexte instrument consists of two clusters of collimated nai / csi phoswich detectors with a total net area of @xmath26 @xmath27 and an effective energy range of @xmath28 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "hexte background estimation utilizes off - source data obtained through re - orientation of the detectors viewing directions .",

    "the instrumental background estimate is determined from modeling of both the internal background of the detectors and the background due to cosmic x - ray flux and charged particle events .",
    "the arrival times of the photons were corrected to the solar system barycenter using the jpl de200 ephemeris and the source coordinates r.a .",
    "( j2000)@xmath31 and dec(j2000)@xmath32 . the absolute pulse phase of each x  ray photon was then determined from the appropriate radio timing ephemeris from the ongoing monitoring campaign using the parkes telescope ( @xcite ) .",

    "the pulse profile of psr b150958 consists of a single asymmetrical peak below @xmath41 kev , which possibly develops additional components at higher energies ( @xcite ) . for the spectroscopic analysis",
    ", the pulsed flux was taken from photons with absolute phase @xmath2 , which encompasses the entire pulse peak , and the off - pulse flux used photons with phases @xmath42 , corresponding to regions of the lightcurve away from the pulse peak ( @xcite ) . for the pca and hexte data ,",
    "the off - pulse spectrum was obtained by subtracting the background model flux ( pca ) or the off - source flux ( hexte ) from the off - pulse flux .",
    "the pca background model was obtained using the program pcabackest , which models the time - varying detector background , in addition to the constant sky background , as a function of spacecraft position . because the hexte was in the non - rocking mode for most of the observations , only @xmath43 of the @xmath44 kev data was available for the off - pulse spectral analysis . to obtain the pulsed spectrum ,",
    "the off - pulse flux was subtracted from the pulsed flux .",
    "the pca data and the hexte data were fit simultaneously to various spectral models using xspec 10.0 . because of the changing detector gains in the pca between observations , the pca data with the same gain were combined , and fit simultaneously to the summed , gain - controlled hexte data from each cluster . for the pulsed spectral fits ,",
    "pca data in the energy range @xmath45 kev were used , and for the off - pulse analysis pca data from @xmath46 kev were used , because of uncertainties in the background model above @xmath47 kev .",
    "hexte data in the energy range @xmath48 kev were used in both spectral fits , and the data from all the observation days were added ( for each cluster ) . in all",
    "fits the relative normalization between the pca and hexte was a free fitted parameter to account for uncertainties in the effective open area of the two instruments .",
    "the normalization factor of the hexte was found to be @xmath49 of the pca normalization .",
    "for the off - pulse spectral fit , the pca background model produced large residuals for much of the data in the area of the xenon l edge ( @xmath50 kev ) .",
    "as a result of this , only @xmath51 of the pca data were used in the spectral analysis .",
    "the pulsed spectrum from psr b1509@xmath058 ( figure 1 ) is fit equally well by both power law and thermal bremsstrahlung models .",
    "we adopt the power law model here , however , because nonthermal models are clearly favored in the extrapolation to higher energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the power law fit to the pulsed spectrum are given in table 1 .",
    "the fitting algorithm used by xspec is a modified levenberg - marquardt routine ( @xcite ) , and the errors for each parameter in table 1 are @xmath52 , and obtained with all the other parameters fixed at their best - fit values .",
    "the unpulsed @xmath1 kev spectrum was fit to power law , bremsstrahlung , and raymond - smith plasma models .",
    "the latter two models seriously underpredicted the high energy ( hexte ) x  ray flux of the unpulsed component , and the power law model produced the best fit to the data .",
    "the addition of a narrow gaussian line at @xmath53 kev improved the fit , with an ftest significance of @xmath54 . because of systematic uncertainties in the pca background model at energies below @xmath55 kev , the intervening column density was set to zero in the unpulsed spectral fits .",
    "this had a minimal effect on the results , due to the insensitivity of the pca to small absorption columns ( @xmath56 @xmath57 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the counts spectrum of the unpulsed data , fitted to the model with the gaussian line .",
    "the apparent absorption feature at @xmath58 kev is due to imperfect modeling of xenon lines in the instrument response and background model .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the power law and gaussian line model and the single power law model for the unpulsed data are given in table 1 .",
    "the best - fit value of the low energy neutral hydrogen absorption obtained in fitting the pulsed component is @xmath59 @xmath57 , which is higher than the value of @xmath60 @xmath57 obtained by _",
    "asca _ for the thermal cloud only @xmath61 from the pulsar position ( @xcite ) . to investigate the possible inconsistency between the pulsed @xmath62 and the lower value ,",
    "the best - fit contours were calculated as a function of @xmath62 and the photon index using the `` error '' routine of xspec , which calculates the contours of the fit statistic as a function of two parameters , while holding the other parameters fixed .",
    "the results indicate that a value as low as @xmath63 @xmath57 is still allowable at the @xmath64 confidence level .",
    "the _ ginga _ value ( @xcite ) for the photon index and @xmath62 may also be consistent with the _ rxte _ best - fit at the @xmath64 level . the _ rxte _",
    "value for @xmath62 is also roughly consistent with estimations based on the radio dispersion measure of the pulsar . assuming @xmath65 neutral hydrogen atoms per free electron along the line of sight ( @xcite )",
    ", we obtain a value of @xmath66 , given a distance of @xmath67 kpc ( @xcite ) and a dispersion measure of @xmath68 @xmath69 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the _ rxte _ does not exclude @xmath62 values that are consistent with the interstellar absorption and pulsar dispersion measure .",
    "the existence of a spectral break in the hard x  ray spectrum of the pulsed emission from psr b1509@xmath058 , while not seen in the _ rxte _ data , is implied by observations taken at higher energies by egret ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the best - fit _ rxte _ pulsed spectrum of psr b1509@xmath058 and its extrapolation to the egret energy range .",
    "overplotted are the @xmath29 batse data points ( @xcite ) from @xmath21 kev , and the best - fit spectrum from the @xmath20 kev balloon observations of gunji et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . also shown",
    "is the _ rxte _ unpulsed ( nebular ) spectrum . aside from a factor of @xmath70 in batse/_rxte _",
    "normalization , the pulsed spectrum roughly maintains its shape out to at least @xmath71 kev .",
    "the extrapolation to the egret energy range ( @xmath72 mev ) , however , exceeds the @xmath73 egret upper limit ( @xcite ) by a factor of @xmath74 , necessitating a break in the pulsed spectrum somewhere in the energy range @xmath75 mev .    because the _ rxte _ pulsed photon index is @xmath76 , the integrated x",
    " ray energy flux of the pulsar is actually increasing with increasing photon energy , putting constraints on the efficiencies of the processes converting the spindown energy of the neutron star into observable radiation .",
    "if we assume the pulsar and plerionic flux are due to conversion of spindown energy with efficiencies @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , this constraint can be expressed as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the pulsar spindown luminosity ( @xmath82 ) and distance , respectively . in equation",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the energy fluxes from the best fit pulsed and unpulsed spectral models from the _ rxte _ data , and @xmath85 is the solid angle fraction subtended by the pulsar beam ( the unpulsed , plerionic emission is assumed to be isotropic ) . for the pulsed beaming fraction",
    "we adopt the value @xmath86 , which is estimated from calculations by chiang & romani ( 1992 ) . assuming efficiencies that are independent of energy , and a distance of @xmath67 kpc to the pulsar , and setting the lower energy @xmath87 kev and @xmath88 ergs s@xmath13 , yields values for the efficiencies as a function of break energy @xmath89 given by figure 4 .",
    "the calculation in figure 4 assumes that the entire spindown energy budget of the pulsar is expended between the energies of @xmath90 and @xmath89 .",
    "extension of the _ rxte _ pulsed and unpulsed spectra to the radio point at @xmath91 ghz ( @xcite ) implies a total contribution to the spindown energy budget from photons below @xmath90 of @xmath92 of the @xmath1 kev flux , given the radio flux density of @xmath93 mjy .",
    "the break energies in figure 4 are relatively insensitive to the assumed spectral flattening at energies below @xmath94 kev , because the photons at these energies carry @xmath92 of the energy of the photons in the _ rxte _ bandpass . assuming a plerionic efficiency of @xmath95 ( see below ) , a pulsed efficiency of @xmath96 is required to explain the lack of a spectral break below @xmath71 kev implied by the combined _ rxte _ and batse observations .",
    "a plerion efficiency of @xmath97 would require an even higher pulsed efficiency , but this could be eased if the pulsar has a narrow beam ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the pulsed efficiency obtained above is slightly higher than the @xmath99 efficiency predicted by outer gap models of high energy emission from young pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "outer gap models have difficulties explaining the lack of gev gamma ",
    "rays from psr b1509@xmath058 as well , because in these models the emission sites are located in the outer magnetosphere , where attenuation due to magnetic effects should be minimal ( @xcite ) .",
    "a polar cap model of the psr b1509@xmath058 pulsed emission ( @xcite ) explains the attenuation of the gamma ",
    "ray photons in terms of magnetic photon splitting and pair production , but places the spectral break at energies @xmath100 mev , which would require a relatively large pulsed efficiency of at least @xmath101 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "this model also requires a polar cap for psr b1509@xmath058 much larger than produced by a simple dipole field geometry ( @xcite ) , indicating that perhaps a more complicated magnetic field geometry is required to explain the pulsed spectrum .",
    "the spectral fits indicate that a power law form is clearly favored for the unpulsed spectrum , and dominates the total x  ray emission from the psr b1509@xmath058/msh 15@xmath052 system at energies @xmath102 kev ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "images ( @xcite ) indicate that the @xmath103 kev emission from the system is concentrated around the pulsar , and not the surrounding supernova remnant , implying that the unpulsed @xmath1 kev emission seen by _ rxte _ is due to the pulsar plerion , and not supernova emission from msh 15@xmath052 .",
    "the high energy nonthermal emission from plerions is believed to be synchrotron radiation from a luminous `` bubble '' confined by the pressure of the surrounding supernova remnant ( @xcite ) .",
    "the internal pressure of the bubble is provided by a wind of particles and magnetic fields ejected by the pulsar .",
    "the @xmath1 kev luminosity of the psr b1509@xmath058 plerion is @xmath104 ergs s@xmath13 , assuming a distance of @xmath67 kpc to the source .",
    "detailed models of the crab nebula ( @xcite , @xcite ) indicate that an efficiency of @xmath105 can be achieved using reasonable values for the pulsar wind speed , plerion size , and ratio of electromagnetic to particle energy in the wind . for the psr b1509@xmath058/msh 15@xmath052 system ,",
    "figure 4 indicates that similar plerionic efficiencies are allowed if the pulsed efficiency is not too high ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "a higher pulsed efficiency would require a lower plerionic efficiency , as mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath1 kev spectral index obtained for the psr b1509@xmath058 plerion is slightly steeper than the @xmath107 kev index obtained for the crab nebula ( @xcite ) , but the latter index show evidence for gradual steepening throughout the x  ray to gamma ",
    "ray energy range , so the two indices may be consistent .",
    "the marginal detection of a line at @xmath53 kev suggests emission from h  like iron .",
    "the source of the iron line is most likely either the supernova remnant / plerion or the galactic ridge .",
    "the x  ray emission from the latter was mapped out by the japanese satellite _ tenma _ , which found a mean iron line centroid of @xmath53 kev that varied in both energy and flux as a function of position ( @xcite ) .",
    "line centroid is consistent with the galactic ridge emission seen by _ tenma _ , but the flux is @xmath55 times greater than expected from the galactic ridge , suggesting a contribution from iron in msh 15@xmath052 .",
    "observations of the psr b1509@xmath058/msh 15@xmath052 system by _ rxte _ suggest that the hard x  ray spectrum from the system is dominated by nonthermal emission .",
    "the spectral shape of the pulsed and unpulsed radiation are characterized by power laws of photon index @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "considerations of the _ rxte _ data in the context of observations of psr b1509@xmath058/msh 15@xmath052 at other wavelengths allow us to constrain the efficiencies of the conversions of pulsar spindown energy to observed radiation in the system .",
    "the lack of a significant spectral break in the x  ray emission out to hundreds of kev allows the efficiencies for the conversion of particle energy to x ",
    "rays in the pulsar magnetosphere and compact nebula to be constrained .",
    "the minimum pulsed efficiency is found to be @xmath110 , assuming an efficiency for the unpulsed radiation similar to that of the crab nebula .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with richard lingenfelter and a critical reading of the manuscript by vicky kaspi .",
