    "as implicit in the title , we aim at the study of certain degenerations of the generic square matrix over a field @xmath0 along with its main related structures . the degenerations one has in mind will be induced by quite simple homomorphisms of the ground polynomial ring generated by the entries of the matrix over @xmath0 .",
    "these will essentially map any entry to another entry or to zero .",
    "since the resulting degenerated matrices have no generic nature whatsoever , the study of the related structures becomes a hard step .",
    "concretely , let @xmath1 denote an @xmath2 matrix which is a degeneration of the @xmath2 generic matrix and let @xmath3 denote the polynomial ring over @xmath0 generated by its entries .",
    "the related structures will mean primevally the determinant @xmath4 of @xmath1 , the corresponding jacobian ideal @xmath5 , the hessian matrix @xmath6 of @xmath7 , the polar map of @xmath7 defined by its partial derivatives , and the ideal @xmath8 of submaximal minors .",
    "the approach throughout takes mainly the commutative algebra side of the structures , hence ideal theory and homological aspects play a dominant role .",
    "the usual geometric way is to look at @xmath9 as defining the base scheme of the polar map without further details about its scheme nature . here ,",
    "a major point is to first understand the ideal theoretic features of @xmath9 such as its codimension and some of its associated prime ideals , as well as the impact of its linear syzygies . in a second step one focus on the intertwining between @xmath9 and the ideal @xmath8 of the submaximal minors of the matrix . as per default",
    ", we will have @xmath10 and typically of the same codimension . of great interest",
    "is to find out when @xmath11 is a prime ideal and to study its potential nature as the radical of @xmath9 or of its unmixed part .",
    "as far as we know , for the question of primality there are two basic techniques .",
    "one is via verifying beforehand the normality of @xmath12 , the other through a lucky application of the results on @xmath13-generic matrices , as developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we draw on both , depending on the available players . a beautiful question , still open in general to our knowledge , is to determine when the singular locus of the determinantal variety defined by @xmath11 is set - theoretic defined by the immediately lower minors , just as happens in the generic case .",
    "another major focus is the structure of the polar map and its image ( freely called _ polar image _ ) in terms of its birational potentiality .",
    "since the polar map is a rational map of projective space to itself , the image can be defined in terms of the original coordinates ( variables of @xmath3 ) and we may at times make this abuse .",
    "its homogeneous coordinate ring is known as the special fiber ( or special fiber cone ) of the ideal @xmath9 and plays a central role in the theory of reductions of ideals .",
    "its krull dimension is also known as the _ analytic spread _ of the ideal @xmath9 . in this regard , we face two basic questions : first , to compute the analytic spread of @xmath9 ( equivalently , in characteristic zero , the rank of the hessian matrix @xmath6 of @xmath7 ) ; second , to decide when @xmath9 is a minimal reduction of the ideal @xmath11 of submaximal minors .",
    "complete answers to the above questions are largely dependent upon the sort of degenerations of the generic square matrix one is looking at . throughout this work",
    "all matrices will have as entries either variables in a polynomial ring over a field or zeros , viewed as particular specializations of the generic square matrix .",
    "the prevailing tone of this study is to understand the effect of such specializations on the properties of the underlying ideal theoretic structures .",
    "one may wish to distinguish between `` specialization '' and `` degeneration '' , where the latter refers mostly to replacing variables by zeros .",
    "both drop the generic dimension , but there will be some noted differences regarding the behavior of some typical properties and numerical invariants , such as codimension , primality , gorensteiness and cohen  macaulayness .",
    "also , degenerating variables to zero is a delicate matter and may depend on strategically located zeros .",
    "we accordingly study separately two basic instances of these situations .",
    "the first , called informally `` entry cloning '' is dealt with in section  [ cloning ] . here we show that @xmath7 is homaloidal . for this",
    ", we first prove that the jacobian ideal @xmath9 has maximal linear rank and that the determinant of @xmath6 does not vanish , both requiring quite some _ tour de force_. we then move on to the ideal @xmath11 of the submaximal minors .",
    "it will be a gorenstein ideal of codimension @xmath14 , a fairly immediate consequence of specialization .",
    "however , showing it is a prime ideal required a result of eisenbud drawn upon the @xmath15-generic property of the generic matrix ",
    "we believe that @xmath12 is actually a normal ring , but only cared to prove it in the case @xmath16 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath11 is the minimal primary component of @xmath9 and the latter defines a double structure on the variety @xmath17 with a unique embedded component , the latter being a linear subspace of codimension @xmath18 .",
    "an yet additional result is that the rational map defined by the submaximal minors is birational onto its image .",
    "we give the explicit form of the image , through its defining equation , a determinantal expression of degree @xmath19 . from the purely algebraic side , this reflects on showing that the ideal @xmath9 is not a reduction of its minimal component @xmath11 .",
    "we close the section with a conjecture to the effect that @xmath7 divides its hessian determinant and has the _ expected multiplicity _ thereof in the sense of b. segre .",
    "the statement is made more precise with exact numerology .",
    "the second alternative is dealt with in section  [ zeros ] .",
    "we replace generic entries by zeros in a strategic position to be explained in the text . for",
    "any given @xmath20 , the degenerated matrix will acquire @xmath21 zeros .",
    "we prove that the ideal @xmath9 stll has maximal linear rank .",
    "however , the hessian determinant vanishes and , in fact , the image of the polar map is proved to have dimension @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , its homogeneous coordinate ring is a ladder determinantal gorenstein ring . moving to the extreme case where @xmath23",
    ", we find quite surprisingly that the dual variety @xmath24 to @xmath25 has similar structural nature as the polar image .",
    "furthermore , while the latter has dimension @xmath26 , the dual variety has only dimension @xmath27 .",
    "this result answers a question ( oral communication ) of f. russo as to whether there are natural examples where the codimension of the dual variety in the polar image is larger than @xmath28  here the gap is actually arbitrarily large and in addition it is representative of a well structured class of determinantal hypersurfaces . in the sequel , as in the previous section , our drive is the nature of the ideal @xmath11 of submaximal minors .",
    "once again , we have geometry and algebra .",
    "the main geometric result is that these minors define a birational map onto its image and the latter is a cone over the polar variety of @xmath7 with vertex cut by @xmath29 coordinate hyperplanes .",
    "the algebraic results are deeper in the sense that one digs into other virtually hidden determinantal ideals coming from submatrices of the degenerate matrix . these ideals come naturally while trying to uncover the nature of the relationship between the three ideals @xmath30 .",
    "one of the difficulties is that @xmath11 is not anymore prime for all values of @xmath31 .",
    "we conjecture that the bound @xmath32 is the exact obstruction for the primeness of @xmath11 ( one direction is proved here ) .",
    "the second conjectured statement is that the ring @xmath33 is cohen ",
    "macaulay if and only if @xmath23 ( the `` only if '' part is proved here ) .    for a more precise discussion",
    "we refer to the statements of the various theorems . as a guide",
    ", the main results are contained in theorem  [ cloning_generic ] , theorem  [ polar - zeros ] , theorem  [ primality_generic_cloned ] , theorem  [ primality_generic_zeros ] and theorem  [ polar_vs_dual ] .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we assume throughout that the ground field has characteristic zero .",
    "the aim of this section is to review some notions and tools from ideal theory and its role in birational maps , including homaloidal ones .",
    "let @xmath3 denote a commutative noetherian ring and let @xmath8 stand for an ideal .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the symmetric and the rees algebra of @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the literature on these is quite extensive ( see @xcite , @xcite for general guidance ) .",
    "recall that there is structural graded @xmath3-algebra surjective homomorphism @xmath36 .",
    "one says that the ideal @xmath11 is of _ linear type _ if this map is injective .",
    "let @xmath37 denote a notherian local ring and its maximal ideal ( respectively , a standard graded ring over a field and its irrelevant ideal ) .",
    "for an ideal @xmath38 ( respectively , a homogeneous ideal @xmath38 ) , the _ special fiber _ of @xmath11 is the ring @xmath39 .",
    "note that this is an algebra over the residue field of @xmath3 .",
    "the ( krull ) dimension of this algebra is called the _ analytic spread _ of @xmath11 and is denoted @xmath40 .    quite generally , given ideals",
    "@xmath10 be ideals in a ring @xmath3 , @xmath9 is said to be a _ reduction _ of @xmath11 if there exists an integer @xmath41 such that @xmath42 an ideal shares the same radical with all its reductions .",
    "therefore , they share the same set of minimal primes and have the same codimension .",
    "obviously , any ideal is a reduction of itself , but one is interested in `` minimal '' reductions .",
    "a reduction @xmath9 of @xmath11 is called _ minimal _ if no ideal strictly contained in @xmath9 is a reduction of @xmath11 . the _ reduction number _ of @xmath11 with respect to a reduction",
    "@xmath9 is the minimum integer @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "the ( absolute ) _ reduction number _ of @xmath11 is defined as @xmath46 if @xmath47 is infinite , then every minimal reduction of @xmath11 is minimally generated by exactly @xmath48 elements . in particular , every reduction of @xmath11 contains a reduction generated by @xmath48 elements .",
    "the following invariants are related in the case of @xmath37 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 stands for the minimal number of generators of @xmath11 .",
    "if the rightmost inequality turns out to be an equality , one says that @xmath11 has maximal analytic spread . by and large",
    ", the ideals considered in this work will have @xmath51 , hence being of maximal analytic spread means in this case that @xmath52 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath3 is a standard graded over a field @xmath0 and @xmath11 is minimally generated by @xmath53 forms of same degree @xmath13 . in this case , @xmath11 is more precisely given by means of a free graded presentation @xmath54 for suitable shifts",
    ". of much interest in this work is the value of @xmath55 .",
    "the image of @xmath56 by @xmath57 is the _ linear part of @xmath57 _  often denoted @xmath58 .",
    "it is easy to see that the rank of @xmath58 does not depend on the particular minimal system of generators of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we call it the _ linear rank of _ @xmath11 . one says that @xmath11 has _ maximal liner rank _ provided its linear rank is @xmath43 ( = rank(@xmath57 ) ) . clearly , the latter condition is trivially satisfied if @xmath59 , in which case @xmath11 is said to have _ linear presentation _ ( or is _ linearly presented _ ) .",
    "note that @xmath57 is a graded matrix whose columns generate the ( first ) _ syzygy module of @xmath11 _ ( corresponding to the given choice of generators ) and a _ syzyzy _ of @xmath11 is an element of this module  that is , a linear relation , with coefficients in @xmath3 , on the chosen generators . in this context",
    ", @xmath58 can be taken as the submatrix of @xmath57 whose entries are linear forms of the standard graded ring @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the linear rank is the rank of the matrix of the linear syzygies .",
    "recall the notion of the initial ideal of a polynomial ideal over a field . for this one has to introduce a monomial order in the polynomial ring .",
    "given such a monomial order , if @xmath4 we denote by @xmath60 the initial term of @xmath7 and by @xmath61 the ideal generated by the initial terms of the elements of @xmath11  this ideal is called the initial ideal of @xmath11 .",
    "there are many excellent sources for the general theory of monomial ideals and grbner bases ; we refer to the recent book @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be an arbitrary field .",
    "for the purpose of the full geometric picture we may assume @xmath0 to be algebraically closed .",
    "we denote by @xmath62 the @xmath43th projective space , where we naturally assume throughout that @xmath63 .",
    "a rational map @xmath64 is defined by @xmath65 forms",
    "@xmath66 = k[x_0 , \\ldots , x_n]$ ] of the same degree @xmath67 , not all null .",
    "we often write @xmath68 to underscore the projective setup .",
    "any rational map can without lost of generality be brought to satisfy the condition that @xmath69 ( in the geometric terminology , @xmath70 _ has no fixed part _ ) .",
    "the common degree @xmath71 of the @xmath72 is the degree of @xmath70 and the ideal @xmath73 is called the base ideal of @xmath70 .",

    "cremona map_. an important class of cremona maps of @xmath83 comes off the so - called _ polar maps _ , that is , rational maps whose coordinates are the partial derivatives of a homogeneous polynomial @xmath7 in the ring @xmath84 $ ] .",

    "the rational map @xmath88 is called _ the polar map _ defined by @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath89 is birational one says that @xmath7 is _",
    "we note that the image of this map is the projective subvariety on the target whose homogeneous coordinate ring is given by the @xmath0-subalgebra @xmath90\\subset k[\\xx]$ ] up to degree normalization .",
    "the image of @xmath89 is called the _",
    "polar variety _ of @xmath7 .",
    "the following birationalily criterion will be largely used in this work :    [ @xcite , theorem 3.2 ] let @xmath91 be a rational map , given by @xmath53 forms @xmath92 of a fixed degree . if @xmath93)=n+1 $ ] and the linear rank of the base ideal @xmath94 is @xmath43 ( _ maximal possible _ ) then @xmath70 is birational onto its image .",
    "it is a classical result in characteristic zero that the krull dimension of the @xmath0-algebra @xmath95 $ ] coincides with the rank of the jacobian matrix of @xmath96 .",
    "assuming that the ground field has characteristic zero , the above criterion says that if the hessian determinant @xmath97 does not vanish and the linear rank of the gradient ideal of @xmath7 is maximal , then @xmath7 is homaloidal .",
    "quite generally , let @xmath98 denote an @xmath2 matrix where @xmath99 is either a variable on a ground polynomial ring @xmath100 $ ] over a field @xmath0 or @xmath101 .",
    "one of the simplest specializations consists in going modulo a binomial of the shape @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the idea is to replace a certain nonzero entry @xmath105 ( variable ) by a different entry @xmath99 , keeping @xmath99 as it was  somewhat like _ cloning _ a variable and keeping the mold .",
    "it seems natural to expect that the new cloning position should matter as far as the finer properties of the ideals are concerned .",
    "the main object of this section is the behavior of the generic square matrix under this sort of cloning degeneration .",
    "we will use the following notation for the generic square matrix : @xmath106 where the entries are independent variables over a field @xmath0 .",
    "now , we distinguish essentially two sorts of cloning : the one that replaces an entry @xmath107 by another entry @xmath108 such that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and the one in which this replacement has either @xmath111 or @xmath112 .    in the situation of the second kind of cloning , by an obvious elementary operation and renaming of variables ( which is possible since the original matrix is generic )",
    ", one can assume that the matrix is the result of replacing a variable by zero on a generic matrix .",
    "such a procedure is recurrent , letting several entries being replaced by zeros .",
    "the resulting matrix along with its main properties will be studied in section  [ zeros ] .",
    "therefore , this section will deal exclusively with the first kind of cloning  which , for emphasis , could be refereed to as _ diagonal cloning_. up to elementary row / column operations and renaming of variables , we assume once for all that the diagonally cloned matrix has the shape @xmath113 where the entry @xmath114 has been cloned as the @xmath115-entry of the @xmath2 generic matrix",
    ". the terminology may hep us remind of the close interchange between properties associated to one or the other copy of the same variable in its position as an entry of the matrix .",

    "the following notion has been largely dealt with in @xcite .",
    "an @xmath118 matrix @xmath117 of linear forms ( @xmath119 ) over a field @xmath120 is said to be _",
    "@xmath13-generic _ for some integer @xmath121 if even after arbitrary invertible row and column operations , any @xmath13 of its entries are linearly independent over @xmath120 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the @xmath118 generic matrix over a field @xmath120 is @xmath122-generic ; in particular , this matrix is @xmath13-generic for any @xmath121 .",
    "most specializations of the generic matrix fail to be @xmath13-generic for @xmath123 due to their very format .",
    "however many classical matrices are @xmath28-generic .",
    "one of the important consequences of @xmath13-genericity is the primeness of the ideal of @xmath31-minors for certain values of @xmath31 . with an appropriate adaptation of the original notation , the part of the result we need reads as follows :    ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1))[pisprime ] one is given integers @xmath124 .",

    "now , on one hand , @xmath143 is the determinant of a cloned matrix of the same type , hence it is irreducible by the inductive hypothesis .",
    "therefore , it is enough to see that @xmath143 is not factor of @xmath146 . for this , one verifies their initial terms in the revlex monomial order , noting that they are slightly modified from the generic case : @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "an alternative more sophisticated argument is to use that the ideal @xmath151 of submaximal minors has codimension @xmath14 , as shown independently in theorem  [ primality_generic_cloned ] ( i ) below .",

    "it is clear that it has a unique ( nonzero ) term whose support lies in @xmath157 and , moreover , the remaining terms have degree at least @xmath15 in the variables off @xmath157 .",

    ", the leibniz expansion of this cofactor has no term whose support lies in @xmath157 and has exactly one nonzero term of degree @xmath28 in the variables off @xmath157 .    by the preceding observation , applying @xmath156 to any second partial derivative of @xmath7 will return zero or a monomial supported on the variables in @xmath157 .",
