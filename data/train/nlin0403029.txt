    "in a world where digital communications are becoming ever more prevalent , there are still services working in analog form . some examples of analog communications systems widely used today include voice communications over telephone lines , tv and radio broadcasting and radio communications ( see table  [ tab : analog ] ) . although most of these services are also being gradually replaced by their digital counterparts , they will remain with us for a long time . usually the need to protect",
    "the confidentiality of the information transmitted by these means might arise .",
    "thus , there is a growing demand for technologies and methods to encrypt the information so that it is only available in inteligible form to the authorized users .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "a secure communication system based on the chaotic baker map was presented , which is a scheme that encrypts wave signals .",
    "first , the analog signal limited in the bandwidth @xmath1 is sampled at a frequency @xmath2 to avoid aliasing . at the end of the sampling process",
    ", the signal is converted to a sequence @xmath3 of real values .",
    "next , the signal is quantized : the amplitude of the signal is divided into @xmath4 subintervals and every interval is assigned a real amplitude value @xmath5 , @xmath6 , its middle point for example .",
    "thus , a new sequence is generated by replacing each @xmath7 by the @xmath5 associated to the subinterval it belongs to : @xmath8 , where each @xmath9 takes its value from the set @xmath10 . once the original wave signal is sampled and quantized , and restricted to the unit interval ,",
    "a chaotic encryption signal @xmath11 , @xmath12 , is used to generate the ciphertext .",
    "this signal is obtained by either sampling a chaotic one or by a chaotic mapping . for the purposes of our analysis , the process to generate the chaotic signal is irrelevant since our results apply equally to any signal . finally , an ordered pair @xmath13 is constructed , localizing a point in the unit square . in order to encrypt @xmath9 , the baker map is applied @xmath0 times to the point @xmath13 to obtain : @xmath14 the encrypted signal is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath0 is considered as the secret key of the cryptosystem . as a result , a plaintext signal with values @xmath16 , is encrypted into a signal which can take @xmath17 different values . for a more complete explanation of this cryptosystem ,",
    "it is highly recommended the thorough reading of @xcite .    in the following two sections ,",
    "the security defects caused by the baker map realized in finite precision are discussed , and then the fact that the secret key @xmath0 can be directly deduced from the ciphertext is pointed out . after the cryptanalysis results , which constitute the main focus of our paper ,",
    "some countermeasures are discussed on how to improve the security of the chaotic cryptosystem .",
    "the last section concludes the paper .",
    "the proposed cryptosystem uses the baker map as a mixing function .",
    "the baker map is an idealized one in the sense that it can only be implemented with finite precision in digital computers and , as a consequence , in this case it has a stable attractor at @xmath18 .",
    "this is easy to see when the value of @xmath19 is represented in binary form with @xmath20 significant bits . assuming @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , the baker map runs as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the left bit - shifting operation",
    "apparently , the most significant bit @xmath25 is dropped during the current iteration . as a result , after @xmath26 iterations , @xmath27 .",
    "once @xmath27 , it is obvious that @xmath28 will exponentially converge to zero within a finite number of iterations , i.e. , the digital baker map will eventually converge to the stable attractive point at @xmath18 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] .",
    "it is important to note that this result does not depend on the real number representation method , on the precision , or on the rounding - off algorithm used , since the quantization errors induced in eq .",
    "( [ equation : bakermap ] ) are always zeros in any case .    considering that in today s digital computers real values are generally stored following the ieee floating - point standard @xcite , let us see what will happen when the chaotic iterations run with 64-bit double - precision floating - point numbers . following the ieee floating - point standard ,",
    "most 64-bit double - precision numbers are stored in a normalized form as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represent the number bits , @xmath31 means a binary number and the first mantissa bit occurring before the radix dot is always assumed to be 1 ( except for a special value , zero ) and not explicitly stored in @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath33 , assume it is represented in the following format : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "apparently , it is easily to deduce @xmath36 . considering @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "when @xmath39 is generated uniformly with the standard c ` rand ( ) ` function in the space of all valid double - precision floating - point numbers , both @xmath40 and @xmath41 will approximately satisfy an exponentially decreasing distribution , and then it can be easily proved that the mathematical expectation of @xmath20 is about 53 @xcite .",
    "this means that the value of the secret key @xmath0 must not be greater than 53 . in other words",
    ", it is expected that each plaintext sample @xmath9 can not be correctly decrypted when @xmath0 is greater than 53 ( or even smaller but close to 53 ) , since the counter - iterating process is unable to get @xmath42 from @xmath43 due to the loss of precision during the forward iterations . figure  [ fig : ber ] plots the recovery error obtained for different values of the secret key @xmath0 when a 100-sample ciphertext is decrypted .",
    "it can be appreciated how the plaintext is correctly recovered only when @xmath44 . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the system does not work at all . as a consequence ,",
    "only @xmath46 secret keys have to be tried to break a ciphertext encrypted with this cryptosystem .",
    "this takes a modern desktop computer less than a second for moderated lengths of the plaintext .",
    "this attack is called a brute force attack , which breaks a cipher by trying every possible key .",
    "the feasibility of a brute force attack depends on the size of the cipher s key space and on the amount of computational power available to the attacker . with today",
    "s computer technology , it is generally agreed in the cryptography community that a size of the key space @xmath47 is insecure @xcite . compare this figure with the key space @xmath48 of the cipher under study .",
    "if the value of @xmath0 could be arbitrarily enlarged , then the encryption process would slow down until it would be unusable in practice .",
    "thus , from any point of view , this is an impractical encryption method because it is either totally insecure or infinitely slow , without any reasonable tradeoff possible . in @xcite",
    "it is said that the encryption is applied to the wave signal instead of the symbolic sequence .",
    "therefore , in table  [ tab : analog ] a review of some widely used multimedia communications systems with their bandwidth and sampling frequencies is given .",
    "these are the kind of signals that might be encrypted by the system proposed in @xcite .",
    "consider for example tv broadcasting , which transmits 12,000,000 samples per second .",
    "it is impossible to iterate the baker map billions of times for 12,000,000 samples in one second with average computing power .",
    "finally , another physical limitation of the cryptosystem is that when @xmath0 is very large , each encrypted sample @xmath15 would require a vast amount of bits to be transmitted , which would require in turn a transmission channel with infinite capacity , meaning that the system can not work in practice .",
    "even assuming that the messages are encrypted with an imaginary computer with infinite precision and infinite speed , using an infinite - bandwidth channel , and an idealized version of the baker map , the cryptosystem would be broken as well because the secret key @xmath0 can still be derived from only one amplitude value of the ciphertext . to begin with ,",
    "let us assume that two quantization levels are used , that is , @xmath49 . during the encryption process",
    "a binary tree is generated in the following way : @xmath50 where @xmath31 following the decimal number denotes its binary format .",
    "the fact that the ciphertext uses @xmath17 discrete amplitudes constitutes its weakest point .",
    "it is possible to directly get the value of @xmath0 with only one known amplitude . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tree ] ) , it is obvious that @xmath15 is always one value in the set @xmath51 as mentioned above , in the case that the real values are stored in the ieee - standard floating - point format @xcite , any amplitude value @xmath15 will be represented in the following form : @xmath52 where @xmath53 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : set ] ) , one can see that @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we can directly derive @xmath55 , by checking which bit is the least significant bit ( i.e. , the least significant 1-bit ) in all bits of @xmath15 .    a more intuitive way to compute @xmath0 from a single amplitude value , @xmath15 , consists of two steps : i )",
    "represent this amplitude value in fixed - point binary form ; ii ) count the bits in the fixed - point format of @xmath15 to determine the value of an integer @xmath56 , which is the number of bits after the radix dot and before the least significant bit , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "obviously , @xmath58 .",
    "similarly , for other values of @xmath59 , one can easily deduce that @xmath60 ; and for @xmath61 , the value of @xmath0 can still be derived easily , but the calculation algorithm depends on how the binary tree shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tree ] ) is re - designed .",
    "although in @xcite it is hinted that the value of @xmath0 could be changed dynamically based on some information of the encrypted trajectory , this idea would not further increase the security of the cryptosystem as long as @xmath17 different amplitudes are still possible for each different @xmath0 value .",
    "this means that the ciphertext value @xmath62 , whatever @xmath63 , can only take values from the finite set defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : set ] ) for the given @xmath63 .",
    "hence , for each @xmath62 the value of @xmath63 can be computed as described above and the security is again compromised .",
    "there are many ways to improve the security of the attacked cryptosystem .",
    "this section introduces three possible ones : changing the key , changing the 2-d chaotic map , and masking the ciphertext with a secret signal . note that only the basic ideas are given , and the concrete designs and detailed security analysis are omitted because this is not the main focus of our paper .      as mentioned above , in addition to the above - discussed security defects of the secret key @xmath0 , using @xmath0 as the secret key has another obvious paradox : from the point of view of the security",
    ", @xmath0 should be as large as possible ; while from the point of view of the encryption speed , @xmath0 should be as small as possible .",
    "apparently , @xmath0 is not a good option as the secret key .    instead of using @xmath0 , better candidates for the secret key must be chosen , such as the control parameter of the 2-d chaotic map and the generation parameter of the encryption signal @xmath19 .",
    "if the former is chosen , the baker map has to be modified to introduce some secret control parameters , as described in the following section .      as shown above ,",
    "the multiplication factor 2 in the original baker map is the essential reason of its convergence to @xmath18 in the digital domain , so the baker map has to be modified to cancel this problem , or another 2-d chaotic map without this problem has to be used .",
    "a possible way is to generalize the original baker map to a discretized version over a @xmath64 lattice of the unit plane .",
    "for example , when @xmath65 , the lattice is composed of the following four points : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "a typical example of baker map discretized in this way can be found in @xcite , reproduced next for convenience .",
    "first , the standard baker map is generalized by dividing the unit square into @xmath70 vertical rectangles , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 .",
    "the lower right corner of the @xmath41th rectangle is located at @xmath76 .",
    "formally the generalized map is defined by : @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "the next step consists of discretizing the generalized map .",
    "if one divides an @xmath79 square into vertical rectangles with @xmath4 pixels high and @xmath80 pixels wide , then the discretized baker map can be expressed as follows : @xmath81 where the pixel @xmath82 is with @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the sequence of @xmath70 integers , @xmath85 , is chosen such that each integer @xmath63 divides @xmath4 , and @xmath86 .",
    "the formula can be extended for @xmath64 rectangles ( see @xcite ) .",
    "with such a discretization , the negative convergence to zero can be removed . however ,",
    "another negative digital effect , the recurrence of the orbit , arises in this case , since any orbit will eventually become periodic within @xmath87 iterations .",
    "this means that the security defect caused by the small key space is not essentially improved .",
    "thus , the discretized baker map must be used when the key is changed to be its discretization parameters .",
    "another way is to use entirely different 2-d chaotic maps with one or more adjustable parameters , which can be used as the secret key instead of @xmath0 .      an easy way to enhance",
    "the security of the cryptosystem is to mask the ciphertext with a _ secret",
    "_ pseudo - random signal , which can efficiently eliminate the possibility to derive the estimated value of @xmath0 from one amplitude of the ciphertext .",
    "the secret masking sequence can be the chaotic encryption signal @xmath88 , and the parameters of controlling the generation process of @xmath88 should be added as part of the secret key . in this case , the ciphertext is changed from @xmath89 into @xmath90 .",
    "note that the masking can be considered as an added stream cipher to the original system .",
    "this is a common technique to achieve stronger ciphers @xcite .",
    "in summary , the new cryptosystem proposed in @xcite can be broken due to the limitation of computers to represent real numbers .",
    "even if an ideal computer with infinite precision were used to encrypt the messages , the cipher can still be broken due to the fact that the number and value of possible amplitude values in the ciphertext depend directly on the secret key @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , for the cryptosystem to work with large values of @xmath0 , an ideal computer with infinite computing speed , infinite storage capacity , and infinite transmission speed would be required . as a consequence , we consider that this cryptosystem should not be used in secure applications .",
    "some possible countermeasures are also discussed on how to improve the security of the cryptosystem under study .",
