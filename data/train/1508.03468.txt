    "the study of symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) phases has attracted a considerable amount of attention  @xcite .",
    "recently , generalizations of spt phases with higher - form symmetry have been discussed  @xcite .",
    "ordinary spt phases are discussed in the presence of a global @xmath4-form symmetry operator of the on - site form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an element of the symmetry group @xmath7 and @xmath8 represents a lattice site .",
    "the symmetry operator imposes a conservation law where charged excitations are point - like objects .",
    "a @xmath0-form global symmetry can be imposed by an operator of the form @xmath9 which acts on a closed codimension-@xmath0 manifold @xmath10 ( codimension @xmath11 for a space - time ) . in such a theory ,",
    "charged excitations have @xmath0 space dimensions and symmetry operators impose conservation laws on higher - dimensional charged objects .",
    "there have been several pioneering works in this direction  @xcite .",
    "namely the work by kapustin and thorngren proposes a family of lattice realizations by replacing a finite group by a finite 2-group  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present simple lattice realizations of bosonic spt phases with higher - form global symmetry and discuss their quantum information application .",
    "bosonic spt phases are often constructed by using mathematical machinery such as group cohomology / cobordism and their physical properties are typically explained via gauge / gravity anomalies  @xcite . in this paper , we shall restrict our attentions to rather simple realizations with @xmath12 symmetry and study their `` properties '' in a systematic manner .",
    "( generalization to @xmath13 symmetry , or arbitrary abelian symmetry , is also possible ) .",
    "the proposed models have a short - range entangled unique gapped ground state on a closed manifold which is protected by higher - form global symmetry . in our construction ,",
    "charged excitations of different dimensionality may coexist and form a short - range entangled state which is protected by symmetry operators of different dimensionality .",
    "for instance , to provide some insight , we mention the existence of a non - trivial @xmath14-dimensional model protected by @xmath4-form , @xmath15-form and @xmath16-form @xmath17 symmetry where charged particles , loops and membranes form a short - range entangled vacuum .",
    "kapustin and thorngren provided a framework for constructing spt phases protected by @xmath4-form and @xmath15-form symmetries by using @xmath16-group .",
    "a complementary feature of our work is that the model admits arbitrary @xmath0-form symmetries and its construction is simple .",
    "also , some of our models do not seem to fit into the framework of the @xmath16-group construction despite the fact that these models possess @xmath4-form and @xmath15-form symmetries only .",
    "let us clarify what we mean by _ non - trivial _",
    "spt phases .",
    "we will say that a wavefunction is non - trivial if its preparation from a product state requires a large - depth local quantum circuit . by a local quantum circuit ,",
    "we mean a unitary operation that can be implemented by a local hamiltonian which may be time - dependent . by a large - depth ,",
    "we mean that it takes a system - size dependent time to implement the required unitary operation .",
    "ground states of ( intrinsic ) topologically ordered hamiltonians are known to be non - trivial in this sense .",
    "non - triviality of spt wavefunctions can be defined by restricting considerations to local quantum circuits which commute with imposed symmetries .",
    "namely , each local component of the quantum circuit needs to commute with symmetry operators . to prove the non - triviality of the wavefunctions in the presence of symmetry , we employ three different arguments .",
    "first we consider the models with open boundaries and demonstrate that they have protected boundary modes which trivial models can not possess .",
    "namely , boundary mode may be gapless , spontaneous symmetry - breaking phase and/or topological phase depending on dimensionality of symmetry operators and spatial dimensions .",
    "while this type of arguments has been extensively used as simple diagnostic of non - triviality of spt wavefunctions on the bulk , its connection to the circuit complexity of wavefunctions is rather indirect .",
    "second we minimally couple the spt hamiltonians to generalized ( higher - form ) gauge fields .",
    "namely , for @xmath0-form symmetry , the system is coupled to @xmath18-form gauge fields .",
    "we show that gauged versions of trivial and non - trivial spt hamiltonians belong to different topological phases , which implies that the original hamiltonians ( and wavefunctions ) belong to different quantum phases in the presence of symmetries .",
    "this type of argument was originally proposed by levin and gu in the context of @xmath4-form spt phases , and can be converted into a fairly rigorous argument by formulating the gauging as a duality map .",
    "( see  @xcite for instance ) .",
    "third we shall construct a gapped domain wall in a @xmath2-dimensional topological phase by gauging the @xmath1-dimensional spt wavefunction in @xmath2 space dimensions by following the idea in  @xcite .",
    "we then show that a gapped domain wall transposes excitations in a non - trivial manner which is possible only if the underlying spt wavefunction is non - trivial .",
    "this type of argument is perhaps non - standard in condensed matter and high energy community , but is indeed natural from quantum information theoretical viewpoint .",
    "these three characterizations show that proposed models of higher - form spt phases are indeed non - trivial in a sense of quantum circuit complexity .",
    "there are two key ingredients in our construction .",
    "first all the models are constructed on @xmath1-dimensional simplicial lattices which are @xmath19-colorable , meaning that one can assign @xmath19 distinct color labels to vertices of the lattice such that neighboring vertices have different colors .",
    "colorable graphs have a number of useful properties in discussing lattice realizations of topological theories  @xcite .",
    "for instance , we shall see that gauged models can be defined on the same graph without modifying the lattice structure .",
    "the simplest example of colorable graphs is a two - dimensional triangular lattice where three color labels can be assigned to vertices .",
    "second , to construct non - trivial models , we shall use unitary phase gates , known as multi - qubit control-@xmath3 gates in quantum information community , which are closely related to a certain non - trivial @xmath20-cocycle function for @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "multi - qubit control-@xmath3 gates are of particular importance in the context of fault - tolerant quantum computation since they are outside of the clifford group when involving three or more qubits  @xcite .",
    "the overall construction is summarized as follows .",
    "let @xmath22 be @xmath19 distinct color labels .",
    "we think of splitting color labels into several groups .",
    "we then place qubits on @xmath0-simplexes according to the splitting .",
    "for instance , for @xmath23 , one may have the following splitting : @xmath24 and qubits are placed on @xmath4-simplexes of color @xmath25 , @xmath15-simplexes of color @xmath26 and @xmath16-simplexes of color @xmath27 .",
    "we then apply multi - qubit control-@xmath3 gates on each @xmath1-simplex to obtain the non - trivial hamiltonian from a trivial hamiltonian . in the above example",
    ", we will obtain a five - dimensional model with @xmath28-form @xmath29 symmetry by applying three - qubit control-@xmath3 gates .",
    "the system supports point - like , loop - like and membrane - like charged excitations .",
    "while our studies are limited to models with @xmath12 symmetries , the constructions can be generalized to systems with @xmath13 symmetries by using a certain generalization of control-@xmath3 gates as briefly explained in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our construction can be viewed as a special realization of hyper - graph states recently proposed in  @xcite , and thus , applications to measurement - based quantum computations may be an interesting future problem .",
    "classification of topological phases of matter is a problem of fundamental and practical importance , bridging condensed matter physics and quantum information science . at a formal level ,",
    "lattice models of topological phases of matter can be probably classified by using the framework of higher - category theory .",
    "this , however , does not mean that classification of topological order is completed since category theoretical approaches provide only a set of consistency equations , such as pentagon and hexagon equations .",
    "solving consistency equations are rather difficult both analytically and computationally , and thus finding a non - trivial solution to consistency equations seems to be the real challenge .",
    "our lattice models , before and after coupling to gauge fields , presumably satisfy these consistency equations of category theoretical approaches , and are beyond known theories of topological order , such as the walker - wang model  @xcite and the dijkgraaf - witten topological gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "thus , our model may serve as a stepping stone to further looking for exotic topological phases of matter , which may be of importance for quantum information processing purposes .",
    "indeed , proposed models of spt phases with higher - form symmetry have interesting quantum coding applications . in  @xcite",
    ", it has been pointed out that the classification of bosonic spt phases with @xmath4-form symmetry and classification of fault - tolerant logical gates in topological quantum codes are closely related .",
    "the construction of bosonic spt phases with higher - form symmetry enables us to find ( somewhat surprising ) fault - tolerantly implementable logical gates .",
    "for instance , consider a four - dimensional system consisting of two copies of the @xmath30-toric code and one copy of the @xmath31-toric code . here , the @xmath32-toric code refers to the @xmath33-dimensional toric code with @xmath34-dimensional pauli-@xmath3 logical operators and @xmath35-dimensional pauli-@xmath36 logical operators .",
    "we choose these three copies of the toric code to be decoupled from each other .",
    "as we shall see , there exists a non - trivial three - dimensional spt model which is protected by @xmath4-form @xmath37 symmetry and @xmath15-form @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "the presence of such an spt phase implies that one can implement a three - qubit control-@xmath3 logical gate , belonging to the third - level of the clifford hierarchy , among three copies of the four - dimensional toric code fault - tolerantly by a finite - depth local quantum circuit .",
    "this is rather surprising given the fact that the @xmath30-toric code and the @xmath31-toric code possess logical operators of different dimensionality and thus belong to different topological phases .",
    "our approach may give a hint on how to implement multi - qubit unitary logical gates on multiple quantum error - correcting codes of different code generators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec:0-form ] of the paper is devoted to a brief review of bosonic spt phases with @xmath4-form symmetry .",
    "while this is a throughly explored subject , we try to provide a concise , yet precise treatment of various properties of @xmath4-form spt phases , such as the boundary mode , outcome of coupling to gauge fields and corresponding gapped boundaries , by using concepts from quantum information theory .",
    "although we do not provide any new results in this section , our treatment and observations may have some novelty . in section  [ sec : higher - form ] , we will present lattice realizations of a bosonic spt phase with generalized global symmetry and discuss their physical properties .",
    "we demonstrate that boundary of these models exhibits spontaneous breaking of symmetry , gapless critical modes or / and topological phases . in section  [ sec : gate ] , we comment on quantum coding implications of our results .",
    "we begin by presenting a simple recipe of how to construct certain families of bosonic spt wavefunctions with @xmath4-form symmetry by using multi - qubit control-@xmath3 operators .",
    "namely , we construct wavefunctions for @xmath1-dimensional spt phases with @xmath38 symmetry .",
    "we then study their boundary modes by finding dressed boundary operators which commute with the bulk hamiltonian while satisfying certain commutation relations of pauli operators . in a quantum coding language ,",
    "boundary modes and dressed boundary operators can be viewed as a codeword space and logical operators of the bulk hamiltonian respectively .",
    "this allows us to study symmetry constraints on boundary terms and discuss the boundary mode protected by symmetry .",
    "we also discuss the procedure of coupling spt phases to gauge fields and corresponding gapped domain walls .",
    "we begin by presenting the definition of a multi - qubit control-@xmath3 gate  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_multi_qubit_gate](a ) for its quantum circuit representation ) .",
    "the control-@xmath3 gate , denoted by @xmath39 , is a two - qubit phase gate acting in the computational basis as @xmath40 which adds @xmath41 phase if both the first and second qubits are in @xmath42 state .",
    "one can generalize the control-@xmath3 gate to a system of multiple qubits .",
    "the @xmath43-qubit control-@xmath3 gate , denoted by @xmath44 , acts as follows @xmath45     gate @xmath46 .",
    "( b ) conjugation by the three - qubit control-@xmath3 gate .",
    "note that @xmath47 . ]",
    "it is convenient to summarize how pauli @xmath36 operators transform under conjugation by multi - qubit control-@xmath3 operators .",
    "for a two - qubit control-@xmath3 gate , one has @xmath48 for a multi - qubit control-@xmath3 gate , one has @xmath49 here @xmath50 acts on the @xmath8th qubits ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "so , conjugation by @xmath44 adds `` decoration '' of @xmath52 on pauli @xmath36 operators ( fig .",
    "[ fig_multi_qubit_gate](b ) ) .",
    "multi - qubit control-@xmath3 gates have particularly useful applications in quantum coding theory since @xmath44 belongs to the @xmath43-th level of the so - called clifford hierarchy  @xcite which is an important concept in classifying fault - tolerantly implementable logical gates in topological stabilizer codes .",
    "readers who are familiar with topological gauge theories may recognize the similarity between @xmath44 operators and a non - trivial @xmath43-cocycle function for @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "for the connection between group cohomology and the clifford hierarchy , see  @xcite .      in this subsection",
    ", we study the one - dimensional spt phase with @xmath37 symmetry  @xcite . consider a one - dimensional chain of @xmath58 qubits with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we assign color labels @xmath59 to vertices in a bipartite manner such that odd ( even ) sites have color @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "one has @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "however , the quantum circuit @xmath73 is not symmetric since each local component , @xmath70 , does not commute with symmetry operators @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "( one important subtlety is that @xmath73 commutes with @xmath77 and @xmath78 as a whole , but one can not implement it through local quantum gates which commute with @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",

    "as such , @xmath97 characterize the left boundary mode and @xmath98 characterize the right boundary mode . in the language of quantum coding theory",

    "in this picture , boundary modes are logical qubits encoded in the codeword space @xmath87 .",
    "these boundary operators are `` dressed '' in a sense that they involve pauli operators on the bulk .",
    "while dressed boundary operators commute with the bulk terms , they are not symmetric under @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "we can then ask what kinds of boundary terms are allowed under this symmetry .",
    "observe that a term on the left boundary needs to commute with @xmath103 and @xmath104 , implying that there is no term that can be added on the left boundary .",
    "a similar argument holds for the right boundary .",
