    "white dwarfs ( wds ) are the typical end products of most main sequence stars ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "wds are therefore the most numerous stellar remnants in the galaxy .",
    "the mass distribution and mass function ( mf ) of hydrogen - rich ( da ) wds have been intensively studied during the last decades .",
    "these studies reveal a clear and predominant concentration of objects at @xmath40.6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a low - mass peak at @xmath40.4 has been also frequently found @xcite .",
    "this feature is believed to arise as a simple consequence of binary star evolution . in this scenario",
    "mass transfer episodes truncate the evolution of the red giant exposing its low - mass core , which later becomes a ( typically he - core ) wd .",
    "strong observational evidence in favour of this hypothesis has been provided during the last few years @xcite , although some few low - mass wds have been observed that exhibit neither radial velocity variations , nor infrared flux excess , the typical hallmarks of wds with close companions @xcite .",
    "recent observational studies suggest also the existence of an excess of massive white dwarfs near 1 @xcite .",
    "this feature is generally interpreted as the result of wd+wd binary mergers .",
    "this , in turn , may indicate that the merger rate in the galaxy is considerably larger than expected .",
    "such a high merger rate may have strong implications in the production of type ia supernovae via the double - degenerate channel @xcite .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind , however , that the wd mf that results from analysing the so far largest spectroscopic sample of wds from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) displays no evidence for a distinctive concentration of systems at those specific high - mass bins @xcite . whether or not an excess of massive wds exists is then a controversial issue .    in this work",
    "we derive the mf of wds from the latest spectroscopic catalogue of sdss data release ( dr ) 10 @xcite and show that a clear excess near @xmath41 can only be seen if wds of bolometric magnitude fainter than @xmath412 mag are considered .",
    "we interpret this result as a robust observational evidence for the existence of an excess of massive wds in the galaxy .",
    "we also discuss possible origins leading to this feature .",
    "in this section we introduce the da wd sample studied in this work and provide details on the space density and mass determinations that lead us to derive the mf .",
    "our sample of study is the latest version of the sdss wd spectroscopic catalogue @xcite , which currently contains about 30000 objects . given that we are interested in analysing the mf of da wds , we select only those of this subtype . for these",
    ", effective temperatures and surface gravities have been provided by the sub - sequent sdss wd catalogues during the last ten years @xcite .",
    "these have been obtained fitting the balmer lines sampled by the sdss spectra with model atmosphere spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given that each sdss dr yields re - calibrated spectra respect to previous releases , each of the aforementioned sdss wd catalogues provides updated values of effective temperatures and surface gravities obtained by re - analysing the sdss re - calibrated spectra . in this work",
    "we adopt the most updated ( and therefore , more accurate ) available values .    it is important to emphasize that fitting the balmer lines with model atmosphere models results in over - estimated surface gravity values for da wds cooler than @xmath413000k @xcite , a problem related to the 1d treatment of convective energy transport within the framework of the mixing - length theory @xcite .",
    "however , 3d model corrections are now available , which can be applied to correct for this problem @xcite .",
    "we hence applied these corrections to all cool wds and thus re - derived reliable effective temperatures and surface gravities .    finally , using the cooling tracks of @xcite we obtained the masses , the bolometric magnitudes and the sdss @xmath5 absolute magnitudes of all our da wds from the temperatures and surface gravities measured observationally .",
    "distances were calculated from the distance moduli , taking into account the apparent sdss @xmath5 magnitudes . for the sake of comparison , we repeated this exercise using the updated cooling models of @xcitebergeron / coolingmodels/ ] .",
    "we found no substantial difference between the masses , bolometric magnitudes and distances derived from the two cooling sequences considered .",
    "extinction corrections were also found to be negligible .",
    ".[t - lf ] the values of the lf shown in figure[f - lumfunc ] per m@xmath6 bin .",
    "the units are pc@xmath7 mag@xmath8 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mf of our sample of 5857 da wds is illustrated in fig.[f - mfunc ] .",
    "it displays a predominant peak at @xmath40.6 , a classical feature that has been previously identified in numerous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our mf reveals also the existence of low - mass wds ( @xmath9 ) that are thought to arise as a consequence of mass transfer in binaries @xcite .",
    "low - mass wds have been also frequently identified in previous mfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , a distinctive high - mass excess can be seen in the @xmath40.8 - 1 mass interval of our mf .",
    "this feature has been found not only in mfs derived from magnitude - limited samples of da wds @xcite , but also in the mass distribution of local ( and therefore volume - limited sample of ) da wds @xcite .",
    "however , it has to be emphasized that previous mfs obtained from earlier releases of the sdss da wd catalogue do not display a significant excess of massive white dwarfs at those specific mass bins @xcite .",
    "we investigate this discrepancy in what follows .",
    "the main difference between the analysis presented here and those of @xcite is that , unlike us , they only considered da wds with @xmath212000 - 13000k ( i.e. wds of m@xmath1012 ) .",
    "the reason for this is simply because 3d model atmosphere corrections for such cool wds @xcite were not available at that time .",
    "it is therefore possible that massive da wds were systematically excluded as a consequence of only considering wds of m@xmath6 brighter than @xmath412 mag .",
    "indeed , and as can be seen in fig.[f - mfunc ] , the excess of massive wds disappears if we apply this cut to our sample .",
    "it is well known that massive wds ( @xmath20.8@xmath11 ) cool down considerably slower than typical wds of @xmath40.6 @xcite . however , the main sequence progenitor lifetimes ( for solar metallicities ) are much shorter for the precursors of massive wds  see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this implies that , roughly speaking , for decreasing luminosities the fraction of massive wds becomes increasingly larger , simply because these wds have had more time to cool down than regular ones .",
    "however , we note that the validity of this assessment depends on the specific star formation history of the galactic disc , as well as on possible metallicity effects on the initial - to - final mass relation and on the white dwarf cooling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , we checked if the fraction of massive wds in our sample increases considerably for increasing bolometric magnitudes , and we found that this is indeed the case ( see table[t - frac ] ) .",
    "this naturally explains why the fraction of massive wds excluded in previous analyses of the sdss sample is larger when the m@xmath12  mag magnitude cut is applied to the observed sample .    in the following section we argue the most plausible explanation for the existence of an overabundance of massive wds may be the merger of the degenerate core of a giant star with its companion ( either a main sequence star or a wd ) during or shortly after a common envelope event .",
    "hence , we expect a large fraction of our observed massive wds to be the result of such mergers . in such cases the lifetime of the binary system",
    "before the merger takes place should be of the same order of the progenitor lifetimes of single massive wds , otherwise wds that result from such mergers would not have had enough time to cool down and would therefore not be excluded when applying the m@xmath12  mag cut .",
    "the timescale for a merger event during common envelope can be as short as @xmath40.15gyr @xcite , which is considerably faster than e.g. the 0.25gyr needed for the progenitor of a 0.8 wd to become a wd @xcite .",
    "thus , concluding that a m@xmath12 cut equally excludes massive wds that evolved as single stars and massive wds that may arise as a result of mergers seems to be a reasonable assumption .",
    "in the previous section we provided further and robust observational evidence for the existence of an excess of massive da wds near 1 . in this section",
    "we briefly discuss the possible origins of this feature .    *",
    "the first possible explanation is that a large number of massive da wds are formed by single star evolution . for instance , @xcite proposed an specific shape for the initial - to - final mass relationship that accounts for @xmath428 per cent of all single wds having masses in excess of @xmath40.8 .",
    "however , detailed numerical simulations have recently shown that such an initial - to - final mass relationship can not account for the existence of all massive wds @xcite .",
    "* a recent burst in the star formation history of the galactic disc may contribute to increase the fraction of observed massive wds .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggested that the star formation rate ( sfr ) has two broad peaks at around 2 and 7gyr ago . this could increase the number of massive wds during the last 2 gyr given their shorter main sequence lifetimes .",
    "however , @xcite also demonstrated that such a sfr can not explain the observed overabundance of massive wds . * a third explanation for the existence of a large fraction of massive wds could be that the 1/@xmath13 method somehow overestimates the space density of massive wds .",
    "since such wds can not be seen out to large distances , they are assigned a large weight by the 1/@xmath13 method , hence largely contributing to the space density and mf .",
    "however , the volume - limited sample of da wds , which does not require the 1/@xmath13 correction , displays also a clear excess of massive wds near 1 . * the stellar parameters derived from the spectra of cool wds required 3d corrections @xcite .",
    "if these corrections are somehow inaccurate , then we would expect a clear dependence of the mass on the effective temperature .",
    "we find that this is not the case in our sample ( see fig.[f - mt ] ) .",
    "we can safely conclude then that 3d corrections are not responsible for the observed overabundance of massive wds . *",
    "the typical sdss exposure times are 3090min , depending on the considered plate .",
    "this implies that massive wds observed by sdss may be associated to intrinsically lower signal - to - noise ratio spectra , as these wds are smaller and therefore less luminous .",
    "hence , the mass uncertainties might be systematically higher for massive wds .",
    "the mass uncertainties of our considered sample are below 0.1 in 99.5 per cent of the cases .",
    "we thus re - derived the mf excluding all wds with errors above 0.03 and found that the mf that results from this exercise does not differ significantly from the one obtained using the full sample .",
    "therefore , the mass uncertainties are unlikely to be at the root of the observed excess of massive wds . *",
    "the merger of two wds is currently the most widely accepted explanation for the existence of an excess of massive wds @xcite .",
    "if that is the case , then a large fraction of all massive wds is expected to be magnetic @xcite .",
    "population synthesis studies however do not predict more than @xmath410 per cent of the entire wd population being the result of wd+wd binary mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although these simulations generally assume a constant sfr , the results are not expected to change considerably when assuming e.g. a bimodal sfr such as the one suggested by @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the high - mass excess arises as a consequence of wd+wd mergers , then the merger rate in the galaxy should be much higher than currently expected .",
    "this has strong implications for the production of type ia supernovae within the double degenerate scenario @xcite . for that to be the case",
    ", the merger of the two wds must exceed the chandrasekhar mass limit of @xmath41.4 , which seems to be unlikely based on our ( and also previously published ) mf , as it does not reveal a significant excess of wds more massive than 1 .",
    "however , it is important to mention that wds of mass @xmath21 and effective temperatures below 10000k are associated to m@xmath14 mag @xcite , hence these massive wds are under - represented in our sample ( see fig.[f - lumfunc ] ) . *",
    "an additional explanation leading to the formation of high - mass ( @xmath20.8 ) wds is the merger of the degenerate core of a giant or asymptotic giant branch star with a wd companion after a common envelope event @xcite . in this scenario",
    "a circumbinary disc is formed around the two stars from material that remains bound after the common envelope phase .",
    "the interaction of the circumbinary disc with the binary system reduces the orbital separation and results in the merger of the ( still hot ) core of the giant and the wd companion .",
    "whilst this so - called core - degenerate scenario is proposed as a viable channel for type ia supernovae @xcite , the resulting mergers which do not exceed the chandrasekhar mass will form massive wds instead @xcite . in a similar way",
    ", massive wds may form as a result of the merger of the degenerate core of a giant or asymptotic giant star with a main sequence companion during a common envelope phase @xcite .",
    "after the envelope is ejected the resulting merger will evolve through the asymptotic giant branch in the same was as a single star and form a massive wd .",
    "based on the previous discussion we consider that the most plausible scenarios that may lead to the observed excess of massive wds involve the merger of the degenerate cores of giant stars with their main sequence / wd companions during / after the common envelope phase , and/or the merger of wd+wd binaries .",
    "however , @xcite suggests that wd+wd mergers typically produce wds more massive than 1 .",
    "if is the case , then the wd+wd merger channel is not expected to significantly contribute to an excess of massive wds , as our mf clearly reveals a scarcity of systems above 1 ( figure[f - mfunc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the number of wd mergers that form through the core - degenerate channels is predicted to be much larger than the number of wds that result from the merging of wd+wd binaries ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , it has to be emphasized that the predicted mass distribution of core - degenerate mergers peaks at @xmath40.8 - 0.9 ( depending on the value of common envelope efficiency assumed in the simulations ) and smoothly declines towards lower and larger values @xcite .",
    "the expected population of core - degenerate mergers thus falls precisely within the mass range where the high - mass excess is observed in our mf ( figure[f - mfunc ] ) .",
    "we have obtained the mf of the latest catalogue of sdss ( dr10 ) da wds , including for the first time the cool and faint ( i.e. 6,000 @xmath0 @xmath012,000k , 12 mag @xmath0 m@xmath15 mag ) population .",
    "we demonstrate that a clear high - mass excess is present in our mf , which disappears if only hot and bright da wds are considered ( @xmath212,000k , m@xmath16 mag ) .",
    "we interpret our result as an additional and robust observational evidence for the existence of a high - mass excess near 1 .",
    "although the merger of wd+wd binaries appears as a reasonable explanation of this observed feature , sophisticated population synthesis studies have shown this channel does not contribute significantly to explain the observed excess of massive white dwarfs .",
    "thus , we argue that the most plausible scenario leading to this feature is the merger of the degenerate core of a giant or asymptotic giant branch star with a main sequence or wd companion during , or shortly after , a common envelope episode .",
