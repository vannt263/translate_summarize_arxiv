    "the condition , which we call _ strong residual convexity _ , requires that , for all @xmath49 , the set @xmath53 be always convex regardless of convex subsets @xmath54 in the boundary of @xmath51 ( see definition  [ def : good ] and definition  [ def : strong ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : strong ] illustrates the case where strong residual convexity fails . in conclusion , under the assumption of strong residual convexity , we can show that the star @xmath48 is locally convex near codimension-@xmath13 cells in its boundary ( see lemma  [ lem : main ] ) .",

    "all induction steps are complete .",
    "to summarize , we have the following convexity theorem :    [ intro : main ] let @xmath38 be an @xmath1-complex .",
    "if @xmath38 is strongly residually convex , then @xmath38 is isometric to a convex proper domain in @xmath37 . in particular",
    ", @xmath38 is contractible .    as can be seen in steps ( iii)-(vi ) above ,",
    "codimension-@xmath13 phenomena _ in polyhedral complexes enables us to go from dimension @xmath13 to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "this is a rather common trick which can be found , for example , in the proof of the poincar fundamental polyhedron theorem for constant curvature spaces ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , we find it worthwhile to develop this trick into a form which is suitable for our present purpose .",
    "hence the most of section  [ sec : prelim ] is devoted to the study of geometric links of faces of various dimensions in convex polytopes .",
    "although strong residual convexity is entirely a local condition , for practical reasons , it is desirable to have simple combinatorial conditions under which residual convexity becomes strong residual convexity .",
    "observe that triangles caused the failure of strong residual convexity in figure  [ fig : strong ] .",
    "see also figure  [ fig : notriangle ] . using the codimension-@xmath13 phenomena once again , we define _ triangular _ polytopes and show that without presence of triangular polytopes residual convexity implies strong residual convexity ( see theorem  [ thm : notriangle ] ) . combining this result with theorem  [ intro : main ] we obtain the following corollary , which again implies assertion of theorem  [ introthm : main ] .    [",
    "intro : cor ] let @xmath38 be a residually convex complex . if @xmath38 contains no triangular polytopes , then @xmath38 is isometric to a convex domain which is not @xmath37 .",

    "the details are explained in section  [ sec : pconvexity ] .",
    "the starting point is the above corollary  [ intro : cor ] .",
    "that is , we assume that our complex @xmath38 is residually convex and contains no triangular polytopes . then @xmath38 is isometric to a convex domain in @xmath37 .",
    "thus from now on we regard @xmath38 as a convex subset of @xmath37 and find conditions implying proper convexity of @xmath38 .",
    "our eventual plan is to find @xmath56 supporting hyperplanes of @xmath38 that are in general position .",
    "then @xmath38 is contained in the @xmath1-simplex which is determined by these hyperplanes .",
    "because @xmath1-simplices are properly convex , the conclusion then follows .",
    "fortunately , there is a natural way to find supporting hyperplanes of @xmath38 provided that @xmath38 contains no triangular polytope .",
    "thus we need to find further conditions under which there are @xmath56 such in general position .    for example , if @xmath38 is @xmath13-dimensional and contains no triangle , all polygons in @xmath38 have at least four edges and this enables us to construct the following objects in @xmath38 .",
    "we fix a polygon @xmath57 in @xmath38 . given an edge @xmath58 of @xmath57 , consider the polygon @xmath59 that is adjacent to @xmath57 along the common edge @xmath58 .",
    "then we can choose an edge @xmath60 of @xmath59 which is disjoint from @xmath58 .",
    "we then consider the polygon @xmath61 adjacent to @xmath59 along @xmath60 .",
    "choose an edge @xmath62 of @xmath61 which is disjoint from @xmath60 , and so on .",
    "this process defines an infinite sequence ( _ directed gallery _ ) of adjacent polygons in @xmath38 ( see figure  [ fig : pentagon ]  ( b ) and definition  [ def : gal ] ) .",
    "one can then show that the limit of the lines spanned by the edges @xmath63 is a supporting line to @xmath38 .",
    "now , if the polygon @xmath57 is , say , a pentagon then we have five such supporting lines constructed from the edges of @xmath57 as above .",
    "it is easy to see that two supporting lines coming from two nearby edges of @xmath57 may coincide but those coming from disjoint edges of @xmath57 never coincide . because @xmath64 , this implies that there are at least three supporting lines of @xmath38 which are in general position so that they bound a triangle ( see figure  [ fig : pentagon ]  ( c ) ) .",
    "we now explain how the previous arguments in dimension @xmath13 can be generalized to higher dimensions :    1 .   to be able",
    "to define directed galleries , we need the analogues of polygons with at least four edges . for this",
    ", we re - interpret triangles and define _ cone - like _ polytopes ( see definition  [ def : cone - like ] ) .",
    "if none of the polytopes in @xmath38 is cone - like then we can define directed galleries in @xmath38 .",
    "it turns out that non - triangular polytopes are not cone - like ( see lemma  [ lem : cone - like ] ) .",
    "2 .   fix a polytope @xmath65 in @xmath38 .",
    "each directed gallery associated to a facet @xmath28 of @xmath65 defines a supporting hyperplane @xmath66 of @xmath38 .",
    "because every @xmath1-polytope has at least @xmath56 facets , we have at least @xmath56 such supporting hyperplanes .",
    "3 .   such simple counting as @xmath64 above does not work in higher dimensions , where both combinatorial and geometric arguments are necessary . to deal with the arrangement of supporting hyperplanes , we consider the dual @xmath67 of @xmath65 and points @xmath68 dual to the halfspaces @xmath69 which contain @xmath38 and which are bounded by the supporting hyperplanes @xmath66 . on the other hand , the vertices @xmath70 of @xmath67 are dual to the halfspaces @xmath71 which contain @xmath65 and which are bounded by the hyperplanes @xmath72 spanned by facets @xmath28 of @xmath65 .",
    "each hyperplane @xmath66 associated to a facet @xmath28 of @xmath65 has some restriction on its location ( see lemma  [ lem : restriction1 ] ) .",
    "we translate this restriction in terms of duality to obtain a subset ( _ pavilion _ ) of @xmath67 associated to the vertex @xmath70 , to which the point @xmath68 must belong ( see definition  [ def : pav ] and lemma  [ lem : restriction2 ] ) .",

    "\\(2 ) let @xmath210 be an @xmath1-polyhedron ( which is not necessarily a polytope ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath718 is a group generated by ( projective ) reflections in the hyperplanes spanned by facets of @xmath12 . in @xcite vinberg provided necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath17 to be a discrete subgroup with fundamental domain @xmath12 .",
    "in such case , he also showed that the orbit @xmath759 of @xmath12 under @xmath17 is a convex subset and @xmath17 acts properly discontinuously on the interior @xmath5 of @xmath760 .",
    "it is easy to see that gluing by reflections necessarily gives rise to residually convex structures .",
    "thus , in some special cases , our result provides another proof that the domain @xmath5 above is convex .",
    "namely , if @xmath12 is a non - triangular @xmath1-polytope , if @xmath17 is known to be discrete , and if all stabilizer subgroups of points of @xmath12 are finite , then @xmath761 is a residually convex @xmath1-complex without triangular polytopes and hence corollary  [ cor : notriangle ] applies .    on the other hand ,",
    "because our gluing maps are not necessarily reflections , our results do cover complementary part of vinberg s convexity assertion .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that cocompact / cofinite hyperbolic reflection groups are non - existent in higher dimensions . more generally , a similar non - existence assertion is also true for cocompact ( projective ) reflection groups acting on strictly convex domains ( see @xcite ) .",

    "there he deals with polyhedral complexes which are similar to our residually convex @xmath1-complexes .",
    "but , because the polyhedra he considers have infinitely many facets , his complexes are assumed to satisfy more properties than residual convexity and are rather complicated to describe .",
    "his proof modifies vinberg s arguments and applies small cancelation theory to the @xmath13-skeleton of the dual complexes ."
