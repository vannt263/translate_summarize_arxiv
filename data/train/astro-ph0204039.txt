    "the physical properties of early - type galaxies correlate with luminosity and environment , as exemplified by the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) and the dependence of color , metal content , isophotal shape , nuclear cusp slope , and dynamical support on luminosity ( e.g.  bender & nieto 1990 ; faber et al .",
    "it is unclear to what extent these properties were acquired at the epoch of galaxy formation or result from subsequent dynamical evolution .",
    "progress toward answering these and related issues requires a systematic investigation of the kinematics and line - strengths of a representative sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic shape , internal orbital structure , and radial dependence of the mass - to - light ratio are constrained by the stellar and gas kinematics ( e.g.  van der marel & franx 1993 ; cretton , rix , & de zeeuw 2000 ) ; the age and metallicity of the stellar populations are constrained by the absorption line - strengths ( gonzalez 1993 ; davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 ) .",
    "sauron contributions to these two complementary approaches are discussed in turn by bacon et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and emsellem et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in these proceedings .    here , we focus on the importance of disks in spheroids . in the current context of hierarchical ( i.e.  merger - driven ) structure formation , the dichotomy in the properties of early - type galaxies ( e.g.  faber et al .",
    "1997 ) is often explained by the mass ratio of the progenitor galaxies ( e.g.  barnes 1998 ; naab , burkert , & hernquist 1999 ) .",
    "however , as revealed by sauron , the presence of cold disks in a large number of spheroids suggests a non - negligible role for dissipation , reminiscent of the old galaxy formation debate between merging ( searle & zinn 1978 ) and dissipational collapse ( eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 ) .    after reviewing the core properties of the sauron instrument and sample (   2 ) , we present in   3 sauron observations of a few cold central stellar disks embedded spheroids .",
    "we also illustrate the emission line distributions and kinematics of large - scale gaseous disks in   4 , and compare generic n - body simulations of barred galaxies with sauron data in   5 .",
    "( spectrographic areal unit for research on optical nebulae ) is a panoramic integral - field spectrograph optimized for studies of the large - scale kinematics and stellar populations of spheroids ( bacon et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter paper  i ) . in its low - resolution mode",
    ", it has a @xmath0 field - of - view sampled with @xmath1 lenslets , 100% coverage , and high throughput .",
    "the spectra cover 48105350    with simultaneous sky subtraction .",
    "stellar kinematic information is derived from the mg_b _ triplet and the fe lines .",
    "the [ oiii ] , h@xmath2 , and [ ni ] emission lines provide the morphology , kinematics , and limited information on the ionization state of the ionized gas .",
    "the mg_b _ , h@xmath2 , and fe5270 absorption lines constrain the age and metallicity of the stellar populations .",
    "the sauron survey targets a representative sample of 72 nearby ellipticals , lenticulars , and early - type bulges constructed to be as free of biases as possible while ensuring the existence of complementary data ( preferably space - based ; @xmath3 ) .",
    "the galaxies are further split into `` cluster '' and `` field '' objects and populate the six @xmath4 planes uniformly ( de zeeuw et al.2002 , hereafter paper  ii ) . by construction",
    ", the sample covers the full range of environment , flattening , rotational support , nuclear cusp slope , isophotal shape , etc .",
    "we discuss below the stellar kinematics of 3 galaxies showing the presence of a central stellar disk with varying strengths .",
    "the sauron strategy is to map galaxies to one effective radius @xmath5 , which for nearly half the sample requires only one pointing . for the largest galaxies , mosaics of two or three pointings",
    "reach 0.5  @xmath5 only .",
    "the mean stellar velocity @xmath6 , the velocity dispersion @xmath7 , and the gauss - hermite moments @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( e.g.  van der marel & franx 1993 ) are derived using the fcq method ( bender 1990 ) .",
    "ngc  3384 is a large sb0@xmath10(s ) galaxy in the leo  i group ( @xmath11= 19.6 ) .",
    "it forms a triple on the sky with ngc  3379 and ngc  3389 but there is only marginal evidence for interactions .",
    "the light distribution in the central @xmath12 is complex .",
    "the inner isophotes are elongated along the major axis , suggesting an embedded disk , but beyond @xmath13 the elongation is along the minor - axis ( e.g.  busarello et al .",
    "the isophotes are off - centered at much larger radii .",
    "ngc  3384 shows no emission lines , remains undetected in hi , co , radio continuum , and x - ray , but has iras detections at 12 and 100  @xmath14 m ( e.g.  roberts et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "figure  1 displays the stellar kinematics of ngc  3384 and illustrates a key advantage of sauron . summing the flux in wavelength ,",
    "the galaxy surface brightness distribution is recovered and there is no doubt about the relative location of the measurements .",
    "figure  1 shows that the bulge of ngc  3384 rotates regularly .",
    "mean velocities increase steeply along the major axis up to @xmath15 , then decrease slightly , and rise again .",
    "no velocity gradient is observed along the minor axis .",
    "the velocity dispersion map shows a symmetric dumb - bell structure and the @xmath8 map is anti - correlated with @xmath6 also within @xmath15 ( see fisher 1997 ) .",
    "all these facts point to the presence of a cold , central stellar disk in ngc  3384 .",
    "many other galaxies in our sample show evidence of a central stellar disk .",
    "ngc  3623 is discussed in paper  ii .",
    "figure  2 shows two cases where the disk appears to corotate with a central gaseous disk limited by the dust lane ( rubin et al .",
    "ngc  4526 is a highly inclined sab0@xmath16(s ) galaxy in the virgo cluster ( @xmath11= 20.7 ) .",
    "the stellar disk is not visible in the reconstructed image but is evident in the velocity and velocity dispersion fields . as in ngc  3384 , the rotation on the major axis first increases , then decreases , and increases again in the outer parts , but the disk is much larger .",
    "it appears almost edge - on , giving rise to an elongated depression across the ( hot ) spheroid in the velocity dispersion map , and completely overwhelming the central peak .",
    "ngc  4459 is another s0@xmath17(r ) galaxy ( @xmath11= 20.0 ) in virgo . the same behavior as in ngc  3384 and ngc  4526 is observed along the major axis ( see also peterson 1978 ) but the minimum is shallower .",
    "the isovelocity contours are also less skewed , indicating a more face - on or intrinsically thicker disk ( or both ) .",
    "this is supported by the absence of a clear disk signature in the velocity dispersion map .",
    "a statistical analysis of the entire sauron sample will reveal the true fraction and necessary conditions for spheroids to harbor disks .",
    "we now illustrate the scientific potential of the sauron gaseous data .",
    "paper  ii describes how the h@xmath2 , [ ni ] , and [ oiii ] emission lines are disentangled from the absorption lines by means of a spectral library and optimal template fitting .",
    "results on the non - axisymmetric gaseous disks of ngc  3377 and ngc  5813 are presented in papers  i and ii , respectively .",
    "ngc  7742 is a face - on sb(r ) spiral ( @xmath11= 19.8 ) in a binary system and is among the latest spirals included in our sample .",
    "de vaucouleurs & buta ( 1980 ) identified the inner stellar ring ; pogge & eskridge ( 1993 ) later detected a corresponding small , bright ring of hii regions with faint floculent spiral arms .",
    "ngc  7742 possesses a large amount of hi , molecular gas , and dust ( e.g.  roberts et al.1991 ) and is classified as a liner / hii object .",
    "figure  3 shows the [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 intensity maps , together with the derived velocity and velocity dispersion fields .",
    "most of the emission is confined to a ring coinciding with the spiral arms .",
    "h@xmath2 dominates in the ring ( h@xmath2/[oiii]@xmath18 ) but it is much weaker in the center ( h@xmath2/[oiii]@xmath19 ) . also shown in figure  3 is a reconstructed image composed of [ oiii ] and stellar continuum , and a similar image composed of hst / wfpc2 exposures .",
    "the sauron data does not have hst s spatial resolution , but it does show that our algorithms yield accurate emission - line maps .",
    "the main surprise comes from the stellar and gas kinematics : the gas and stars within the ring are counter - rotating .      ngc  4278 is an e1 - 2 galaxy ( @xmath11= 19.9 ) in the virgo cluster .",
    "it contains large - scale dust and a blue central point source ( carollo et al .",
    "its stellar rotation curve is peculiar , rising rapidly at small distances from the nucleus and dropping to nearly zero beyond @xmath20 ( davies & birkinshaw 1988 ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) . ngc  4278 also contains a massive hi disk extending beyond 10  @xmath5 .",
    "the hi velocity field is regular but has non - perpendicular kinematic axes , indicating non - circular motions ( raimond et al .  1981 ; lees 1992 ) .",
    "figure  4 displays the reconstructed stellar intensity and [ oiii ] map obtained with sauron . despite the regular and well - aligned stellar isophotes ,",
    "the distribution of ionized gas is very extended and strongly non - axisymmetric , similar to a bar terminated by ansae as observed in spiral galaxies .",
    "the gaseous bar is reminiscent of the dust structure observed at the center of cen  a ( mirabel et al .",
    "1999 ) , thought to have formed from the accretion of a gas - rich object , and could be linked to the active nucleus ( liner / sy1 ) and compact radio core ( wrobel & heeschen 1984 ) .",
    "again , observations of the entire sauron sample will reveal the fraction of spheroids with ionized gas and its ionization and dynamical state .",
    "with full knowledge of phase - space , n - body simulations can easily be projected and binned into three - dimensional data cubes .",
    "this allows an easy comparison with stellar kinematic data from integral - field spectrographs such as sauron , without the intermediate step of deconvolution .      in figure  5",
    ", we compare sauron observations of ngc  3623 , a highly inclined sab(rs)a galaxy in the leo  i group ( @xmath11=20.8 ; paper  ii and references therein ) , with a generic barred galaxy n - body simulation provided by e.  athanassoula ( athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 ; see also bureau & athanassoula , in prep . ) .",
    "this is for illustration purposes only , as no attempt was made to match either a timestep or specific simulation with the observations .",
    "a viewing angle was roughly estimated by eye . the line - of - sight velocity profiles extracted from the simulations",
    "were fitted with the same algorithm as the observations ( the latter after deconvolution with fcq ) , allowing a direct comparison , but only major axis profiles were extracted due to low s / n .",
    "the rotation curve disk signature discussed above is clearly seen in both datasets , but the simulation only shows a flattening of the dispersion in the center , not a dip , and the @xmath8 profile is correlated ( rather than anti - correlated ) with @xmath6 in the inner parts .",
    "this suggests that the n - body central component is dynamically hot and rather elongated , contrary to the central stellar disk of ngc  3623 .",
    "it remains to be seen if this is due to @xmath21 orbits .",
    "the simulation also suggests that dissipation may indeed be necessary to create the many stellar disks observed by sauron in spheroids .",
