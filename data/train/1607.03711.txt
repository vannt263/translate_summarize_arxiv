    "we use the pump laser beam , which has a constant phase , as a reference and we overlap this constant - phase reference beam with the real space emission from the wire ( see fig .",
    "[ figs1](a ) ) .",
    "the phase of the polariton fluid can then be extracted from the resulting interferogram . in particular , a phase jump of @xmath29 can be detected in the interference pattern as a discontinuity in the fringes .",
    "[ figs1](c ) presents an interference pattern measured with a high pumping power for the polariton fluid , i.e. , in the nonlinear regime . with the choice of experimental parameters here , a single soliton is present in the wire , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs1](b ) . a @xmath29 phase jump across the soliton is clearly evidenced in the interferogram , at the position indicated by the white arrows .",
    "we emphasize , however , that measuring this phase jump of @xmath29 is not sufficient to ascertain that the density dip in the nonlinear regime is indeed a dark soliton .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , in the linear regime , a standing wave is formed between the pumping spots .",
    "hence , also in the linear regime , there is a @xmath29 phase jump across each density dip , i.e. , between each two nodes of the standing wave , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs1](d),(e ) , for example at the position indicated by the white arrows .",
    "the nonlinear nature of the dark solitons present at high pumping power is confirmed mainly by their abrupt generation and expulsion in both power and phase scans , as shown in the main text .",
    "the presence of the @xmath29 phase jump is a mere sanity check .",
    "a resonantly pumped dissipative nonlinear system , such as a quantum well embedded in a microcavity , in the strong coupling regime , can exhibit bistability when scanning the pumping power upward or downward @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we present experiments revealing that such a bistable behavior is also present in our system .",
    "the bistability affects not only the transmitted intensity , but also the field profile in the cavity .",
    "we also report a bistability of the soliton pattern , controlled by the pumping power .",
    "[ figs2](a ) presents the evolution of the real space emission profile along the wire , integrated over the transverse direction , in an upward scan of the pumping power .",
    "[ figs2](b ) is the corresponding downward scan , with the same experimental parameters and starting from the maximum pumping power reached in the upward scan .",
    "@xmath17 is fixed to a value close to zero ( but non zero ) .",
    "the threshold power corresponding to the transition from the linear to the nonlinear regime , measured at @xmath71 in the upward scan , is lowered in the downward scan to @xmath72 .",
    "as one can see in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figs2](b ) , this behavior corresponds to a standard hysteresis loop .",
    "focusing now on the evolution of the profile in the nonlinear regime , we notice , in the upward scan , a second transition @xmath73 from a profile containing two solitons directly above threshold , to a profile with zero solitons for higher pumping powers .",
    "the mechanism responsible for such a transition has already been discussed in the main text ( fig .",
    "2(e ) ) . in the downward scan however , a profile that contains a single soliton is clearly visible from @xmath74 down to @xmath31 , before the transition to a pattern with two solitons when the power is further decreased .",
    "thus , a bistable behavior of the soliton pattern in the nonlinear regime is identified .",
    "note that the existence of a regime with a single soliton is due to the fact that @xmath17 is not exactly 0 , which relaxes the parity condition for the polariton fluid .",
    "profiles with an even number of solitons are nevertheless still more favorable , which is why the profile with a single soliton is not observed in the upward scan .",
    "this power - controlled bistability is the counterpart of the phase - controlled bistability presented in the main text , in the sense that the number of solitons in the wire can be controlled by two independent parameters : the pumping power @xmath75 , and the phase twist imposed across the wire , @xmath17 .",
    "tuning either of these parameters , the expulsion or generation of a soliton is an abrupt event inherent to the discrete nature of the solitons , and additionally such a transition is associated with a hysteresis when scanning a single parameter .",
    "in this section , we discuss the influence of disorder in the wire on the soliton train generated in the nonlinear regime . we perform numerical simulations as described in the main text , including an additional potential energy term that accounts for the presence of defects in the wire .",
    "a defect is modeled by a gaussian potential : @xmath76 where the defect depth @xmath77 can be either positive or negative , @xmath78 is the defect position and @xmath79 its width .    from the general theory of solitons in atomic bose gases  @xcite ,",
    "it is known that for repulsive @xmath80 defect potentials , the energy of a dark soliton is minimum when the soliton is located at the defect position where the background atomic density is lower ( and viceversa for an attractive defect ) .",
    "this is easily understood in a perturbative picture as the interaction energy with the defect is proportional to the local particle density . on the other hand , the effective mass of a dark soliton seen as a quasiparticle is negative , as intuitively understood from the fact that the dark soliton corresponds to missing particles . as a result , while energy minimization suggests that a dark soliton tends to bind to a repulsive defect , its actual kinematics is characterized by a repulsive acceleration  @xcite .",
    "even if we are not aware of any complete theoretical study for polariton fluids , we can reasonably expect that these features remain valid also in this case . as the dissipative nature of these systems reduces the importance of energetic arguments ,",
    "the physics is however likely to be dominated by the kinetic aspects and our simulations appear to confirm this naive expectation .",
    "[ figs3](a - c ) present the results of numerical simulations carried out with various defects ( b , c ) , compared to a simulation without defects ( a ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to the simulation of fig .",
    "2(c ) of the main text . in both fig .",
    "[ figs3](b ) and ( c ) , the defect width is @xmath81 .",
    "it is clearly visible that the presence of defects modifies the position of the solitons in the wire .",
    "more precisely , a negative defect has an attractive effect for a soliton , while a positive defect repels solitons .",
    "[ figs3](d - f ) shows numerical simulations of the evolution of the soliton pattern in a scan of @xmath17 , highlighting the effect of disorder on the soliton train position .",
    "as discussed in the main text , the displacement of the soliton pattern , shifted rightwards as @xmath17 is increased , is homogeneous in the scan with no defects ( d ) .    in the case of a negative defect ( e ) , the displacement is distorted : due to the attractive effect of the negative defect , a soliton coming close to the defect position is pinned and stays at the defect position in a finite range of @xmath17 . beyond a threshold value of @xmath17 , the soliton is abruptly depinned as indicated by a white arrow in fig .  [ figs3](e ) .",
    "such behavior is very close to the one experimentally observed and shown in fig.3.(e),(f ) of the main text .    for a positive defect on the other hand ( f )",
    ", there is no value of @xmath17 for which a soliton is at the defect position , confirming the repulsive effect of the potential step .",
    "moreover , because of this repulsion , an abrupt jump of the soliton pattern is observed , with a soliton jumping from the left of the defect to its right ( indicated by the white arrow ) , when @xmath17 is increased to the point that the solution with two solitons on the right of the defect becomes more stable than two solitons on the left .",
    "this interpretation in terms of disorder is further supported by the observation that different sections of the sample showed slightly different soliton profiles while keeping the same excitation conditions .",

    "<S> interestingly , the polariton density between the spots and outside of the dark solitons is almost independent of the pumping power . </S>",

    "<S> as a first example , we notice that the abrupt change in soliton number occurs at different excitation powers when the power is scanned downward than when the power is ramped up  @xcite : two different soliton patterns can thus be observed for the same excitation power .    </S>",

    "<S> an increase of the power induces a change in the interaction energy . in the present situation , the phase twist results in a change in the kinetic energy across the fluid , which is accommodated via the expulsion or addition of a soliton to the fluid pattern . </S>",

    "<S> for instance , when three solitons are stable , the measured pattern appears almost fixed in space for a wide range of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by the presence of disorder in the wire , as confirmed by simulations when introducing a small potential dip to model a defect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the slightly smaller bistability range measured in the experiment could also be due to phase noise in the pump beams due to mechanical vibrations of the different optical elements .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4 ] finally summarizes the measured number of solitons versus @xmath17 in the upward and downward scans for different configurations of excitation powers and distances @xmath19 between the two spots . </S>",
    "<S> abrupt switching between trains with @xmath69 and @xmath70 solitons is observed for @xmath69 ranging from 0 to 3 . in each of these situations , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a well defined phase - controlled bistability .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the ability to generate and control soliton trains in a 1d polariton quantum fluid . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to impose a controllable phase twist across the fluid using a coherent drive allows to reveal a novel bistable behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this experimental configuration offers a new perspective to explore the excitation spectrum of soliton trains in pump probe experiments . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , exploiting the relative polarization of the pumping beams , formation of spin domains is predicted  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , from a more general perspective , as the response of a quantum fluid to a phase perturbation is quantitatively related to its superfluid fraction @xcite , our experiment opens the way to the experimental measurement of this crucial quantity in the theory of driven dissipative quantum fluids  @xcite .    </S>",
