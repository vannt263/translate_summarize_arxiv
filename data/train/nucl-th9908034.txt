    "it is widely known that fluid dynamics ( fd ) is governed by the equation of state ( eos ) of the matter , and the analysis of the resulting flow patterns turned out to be one of the best tools to extract the eos from the outcome of a heavy ion collision .",
    "the final event shape must carry the information about the pressure development during the collision including the early stages of the collision .",
    "the phase transition to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is connected to a decrease in pressure according to most theoretical estimates , not only in strong first order phase transition models , but even if we have a smooth but rapid gradual transition .",
    "this reduced pressure and temperature around the phase transition threshold is known for long ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and it is emphasized recently as a qgp signal , i.e. , the `` soft point '' of the eos , which should be possible to observe in excitation functions of collective flow data@xcite .",
    "it was pointed out earlier @xcite that the decrease in the out of plane ( squeeze out ) emission is even more sensitive to the pressure drop and it decreases due to plasma formation stronger than the inplane collective flow .    here",
    "we want to point out another consequence of the same softening in the eos , which is a new distinct flow pattern , which can be seen in almost all theoretical fd calculations with qgp formation , but which was not discussed earlier@xcite .",
    "up to now two basic flow patterns are predicted and detected : ( i ) the directed transverse flow in the reaction plane , or side - splash , or bounce off , which is most frequently presented on the well known @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 diagram and seen at all energies in heavy ion collisions from energies of 30 a.mev to 165 a.gev , @xcite and the ( ii ) squeeze - out effect which is an enhanced emission of particles transverse to the reaction plane at center of mass ( cm ) rapidities .    at lower energies the directed transverse flow resulted in a smooth , linear @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 dependence at cm rapidities .",
    "this straight line behavior connecting the maximum at @xmath2 and the minimum at @xmath3 was so typical that it was used to compare flow data at different beam energies and masses .",
    "if qgp is formed , strong and rapid equilibration and stopping takes place , and close to one - fluid behavior is established .",
    "stopping is stronger than expected , and landau s fluid dynamical model is becoming applicable for central collisions of massive heavy ions .",
    "the soft and compressible qgp forms a rather flat disk orthogonal to the beam axis which is at rest in the cm system .",
    "then this disk starts to expand rapidly in the direction of the largest pressure gradient , i.e. , forward and backward .",
    "thus , the not fully gaussian shape of the measured rapidity spectra can be interpreted as a fluid dynamical bounce back effect ( landau model ) in contrast to the transparency otherwise assumed in kinetic models .",
    "unfortunately in central collisions we can not distinguish the two effects from one - another .",
    "both lead to a spectrum elongated in the beam direction .    at small but finite impact parameters ,",
    "however , this disk is tilted , and the direction of fastest expansion , will deviate from the beam axis , will stay in the reaction plane , but point in directions opposite to the standard directed transverse flow . since pressure does not play a role in transparency , transparency",
    "can not explain such deviation from the beam direction !",
    "this third flow component develops purely from the large pressure gradient at full stopping of the strongly lorentz contracted intermediate state .",
    "so , at the same time as the primary directed flow is weakened by the stronger lorentz contraction at higher energies , this third flow component is strengthened by increased lorentz contraction .",
    "these two flow components together form the elliptic flow.@xcite    on the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 diagram @xcite this component shows up as a smaller , negative flow component at small cm rapidities .",
    "such a third flow component is seen clearly in fig .",
    "3 of @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , lower part ) , fig . 8 of @xcite , fig .",
    "6b of @xcite and fig .",
    "6 of @xcite at or slightly below 0.5 @xmath4 if qgp formation was allowed during the calculation . in sharp contrast , the solutions with hadronic eos did not show this effect , and the maximum and minimum of the @xmath0 curve could be connected with a rather straight line .",
    "this straight line behavior is typical at all flow results below 11 a.gev beam energy ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . in some of the fd calculations with qgp the secondary peak at small cm rapidities",
    "is not seen , but a tendency is obvious , and the deviation from the hadronic smooth line behavior is apparent .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "3 of @xcite , and figs .",
    "6a and 6c of @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the strength of this effect is also impact parameter and beam energy dependent , and the third flow component shows a relative maximum at the same energy when the primary directed flow is at its minimum@xcite .",
    "note that all these fd calculations were done much before the experiments .",
    "the first quantitative flow predictions @xcite preceded the experiments by as much as 6 years ( ! ) and gave rather good agreements with the data .    to have a quantitative measure of the softening at small cm rapidities ( @xmath5 ) for a symmetric ( a+a ) collision , on the @xmath6 $ ] plane we draw the steepest straight line , @xmath7 , through the cm point which is tangent to the @xmath8 curve ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] upper part ) .",
    "the @xmath8 curve and the straight line are usually tangent to each other at @xmath9 , and at finite @xmath1 the @xmath8 curve is under the straight line , @xmath10 . in case of softening at low rapidities the straight line is tangent to the @xmath8 curve at two points , @xmath11 and @xmath12 and at smaller rapidities , and at smaller but finite rapidities , @xmath13 , the @xmath8 curve is under the straight line , @xmath14 , and we will use this quantity , @xmath15 , to characterize the softening of eos . if @xmath16 this means that @xmath8 vanishes somewhere between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 this means that @xmath0 is inverted ( shows negative flow ) at low rapidities .",
    "softening in fluid dynamical model calculations which included the possibility of qgp formation in the eos assumed . when hadronic matter ( hm ) eos was also presented in the same calculation the resulting softening",
    "is also shown for this case .",
    "all hm calculations are consistent with zero softening , while calculations with qgp show softening values from 50 to 180% .",
    "( in @xcite the non - equilibrium 3-fluid hydro is applied with complex eos , i.e. hadron gas eos for the two baryon fluids ( no qgp ) , and eos with qgp - hadron phase transition , which is used only for the third , baryon - free fluid .",
    "although the effects like directed flow are provided by baryons the flow effect arises from the pressure of the central baryon free component .",
    "nevertheless , non - equilibrium effects in 3-fluid hydrodynamical models could mimic the effect caused by the qgp in ideal 1-fluid models , and so the comparison of this model with other fluid dynamical models is somewhat arbitrary . ) [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the quantitative study of this effect in finer impact parameter resolution may even pin down more pronounced deviations in the central rapidity region which is important if we want to use flow data to reconstruct the properties of the underlying eos .",
    "the observed flow patterns at ultra - relativistic energies indicate a new flow pattern , which may arise from a highly lorentz contracted and compressed intermediate state as a consequence of an extremely soft eos .",
    "the presently observed deviations from the straight line behavior go beyond hadronic or string model predictions , indicating a softer and more compressed initial or intermediate state than hadronic models can accommodate .    a review of earlier fd calculations which included qgp shows that such an effect was present already in all of them to a smaller or larger extent .",
    "this sign of excessive softening of the eos may indicate that a larger portion of the matter is transformed into a soft phase than assumed in string models .",
    "the effect shows up in the reaction plane as enhanced emission which is orthogonal to the directed flow .",
    "thus , it is not shadowed by the deflected projectile and target.@xcite as both of these flow components are in the reaction plane these form an enhanced elliptic flow pattern .      in order to be more quantitative further and more detailed experiments",
    "are needed , as well as further fd calculations would be beneficial .",
    "fluctuations , initial pre - equilibrium transparency , viscosity , etc . may decrease the effect in fd calculations also , thus approaching the real reaction mechanism better than recent calculations .",
