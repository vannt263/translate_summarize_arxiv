    "the set of exceptional slopes on a boundary component of a cusped hyperbolic manifold has generated a lot of interest in the literature ; there are many restrictions on the set of exceptional slopes on a boundary component of a hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath1 and its corresponding fillings , for example , no such @xmath1 has two distinct @xmath2 fillings @xcite or more than 10 exceptional slopes @xcite .",
    "however , it is still not known if a hyperbolic knot exterior in @xmath2 can have a reducible filling , or if @xmath1 can have a pair of exceptional slopes @xmath3 and @xmath4 corresponding to a lens space and toroidal space so that the _ distance _ ( minimal number of intersections ) between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is 4 .",
    "conjecturally , neither are possible , see @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "moreover , it is conjecturally the case that the figure - eight knot exterior is the unique one - cusped hyperbolic manifold with 10 exceptional slopes @xcite and that the figure - eight knot exterior and its sister are the unique one - cusped hyperbolic manifolds having two exceptional slopes at distance 8 , see @xcite . in this article , by classifying the sets of exceptional slopes and the corresponding fillings for all manifolds obtained by surgery on the minimally twisted 5-chain link ( see the rightmost link in figure [ sequence : fig ] ) , we provide experimental evidence that supports these conjectures :    [ flash ] if @xmath1 is a cusped hyperbolic manifold obtained by surgery on the minimally twisted 5-chain link then :    * @xmath1 is not the exterior of a knot with a reducible filling ; * @xmath1 does not have a lens space and toroidal filling at distance 4 ; * if @xmath1 has 10 exceptional slopes then @xmath1 is the figure-8 knot exterior ; * if @xmath1 has exceptional slopes at distance 8 then @xmath1 is either the figure-8 knot exterior or the figure-8 knot exterior sister .",
    "a notable collection of chain links is described in @xcite ; they are the figure-8 knot , the whitehead link , the 3-chain link , the 4-chain link with a half twist , and the minimally twisted 5-chain link .",
    "these links are shown in figure [ sequence : fig ] .",
    "we follow @xcite and denote these chain links by 1cl , 2cl , 3cl , 4cl and 5cl , and their exteriors by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the significance of this sequence of links comes from the following facts : each @xmath10 is the ( or conjecturally the ) smallest volume hyperbolic 3-manifold with @xmath11 cusps , see @xcite and @xcite ; more than @xmath12 of the cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds from the callahan - hildebrand - weeks census @xcite are surgeries on 5cl ( personal communication with nathan dunfield ) ; 5cl relates to the program of enumerating exceptional pairs at maximal distance , in particular , all knots realising half - integral toroidal surgeries @xcite , many of the knots realising lens space surgeries @xcite , and all cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds with distinct reducible and toroidal fillings at maximal distance @xcite are obtained by surgery on 5cl .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath13 is equipped with the usual ( meridian , longitude ) homology basis then a @xmath14 filling on any boundary component of @xmath15 results in @xmath16 , and , as a result , that any manifold obtained by surgery on @xmath17cl is obtained by surgery on @xmath18cl .",
    "a classification of the exceptional surgeries on 3cl is given in @xcite together with a complete description of the set of exceptional slopes , and corresponding exceptional fillings , on the boundary components of all hyperbolic manifolds obtained by surgery on 3cl .",
    "a classification of exceptional surgeries on 5cl is found in @xcite ; in this article we completely describe the sets of exceptional slopes and corresponding exceptional fillings of any manifold obtained by surgery on 5cl .",
    "to simplify matters , we only consider the ` new ' manifolds obtained by surgery on 5cl ; namely we only consider surgeries on 5cl and 4cl that are not obtained by surgery on 3cl .",
    "in particular , theorems [ 5cl_thm ] and [ 4cl_thm ] provide explicit descriptions of the sets of exceptional slopes and corresponding fillings for all hyperbolic surgeries of 5cl not obtained by surgery on 3cl , and theorem [ flash ] will be an easy consequence .",
    "we start with section [ basics ] where we recall the classification from @xcite . in order to do so",
    ", we begin by recalling and introducing terminology in subsection [ introbasics ] .",
    "the main results of this article are stated and proved in section [ mr ] and refer to the tables found in section [ tables ] .",
    "the results of this article were obtained as a graduate student at the university of pisa under the supervision of carlo petronio and bruno martelli .",
    "the current presentation of the results has benefited from discussions with daniel matignon and mark lackenby , and from email correspondences with carlo petronio , bruno martelli and nathan dunfield .",
    "we begin with some general terminology , and we introduce the notion of an  exceptional filling instruction \" used in theorems [ 5cl_thm ] and [ 4cl_thm ] .",
    "fix an orientable compact 3-manifold @xmath19 with @xmath20 consisting of tori :    * a _ slope _ on a boundary component @xmath21 of @xmath19 is the isotopy class of a non - trivial unoriented loop on @xmath21 ; * a _ filling instruction _",

    "we will formally identify an @xmath25 slope with @xmath70 and allow parameters @xmath71 to be arbitrary elements of @xmath72 .      by ordering the components of 5cl cyclically , surgery instructions on 5cl",
    "can be naturally identified with @xmath73 .",
    "given such an instruction @xmath3 , the symmetry group of @xmath74 has a natural action on the boundary components of @xmath74 .",
