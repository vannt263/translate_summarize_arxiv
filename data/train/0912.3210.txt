    "it is known the existence of weak solutions , where the motion takes place in the interface between fluids with different constant densities , modeling the contour dynamics muskat problem @xcite .",
    "the existence of weak solutions for general initial data is not known . in this context",
    "we emphasize that the solutions we construct satisfy @xmath21 for any @xmath22 ( see remark [ irregularity ] ) .    from darcy s law and the incompressibility of the fluid we can write the velocity as a singular integral operators with respect to the density as follows @xmath23 where the kernel is a calderon - zygmund type @xmath24",
    "the integral operator is defined in the fourier side by @xmath25    this system is analogous to the 2-d surface quasi - geostrophic equation ( sqg ) @xcite , in the sense that is an active scalar that evolves by a nonlocal incompressible velocity given by singular integral operators .",

    "this result frames ipm in the theory of onsager s conjecture for weak solutions of 3-d euler equations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however there is an extra cancelation , for sqg , due to the symmetry of the velocity given by @xmath30 that provides global existence for weak solution with initial data in @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can find a substantial difference between both systems for weak solutions of constant @xmath26 in complementary domains , denoted in the literature as patches @xcite .",

    "the first results of non - uniqueness for the incompressible euler equations are due to scheffer @xcite and shnirelman @xcite where the velocity field is compacted supported in space and time with infinite energy .",
    "the method of the proof we use in this paper is based on understanding the equation as a differential inclusion in the spirit of tartar @xcite . in a ground breaking recent paper de lellis - szkelyhidi @xcite showed that with this point of view the modern methods for solving differential inclusions could be reinterpreted and adapted to construct wild solutions to the euler equation with finite energy .",
    "our plan was to investigate the scope of this approach in the context of the porous media equation .",
    "however it turned out that the situation is different and we have to take different routes at several places which might be of interest for the theory of differential inclusions .",
    "we describe them shortly .",
    "firstly , using the terminology of this area that will be recovered in the first section , the special role of the direction of gravity yields certain lack of symmetry in the wave cone @xmath32 .",
    "moreover the set @xmath33 describing the non linear constraint belongs to the zero set of a @xmath32 convex function .",
    "then it follows that , opposite to euler , the @xmath32 convex hull does not agree with the convex hull and more relevant @xmath34 .",
    "this is an obstruction for the available versions of convex integration , the ones based on baire category @xcite and direct constructions @xcite .",
    "thus we do not see anyway to use the method to produce solutions to the equation with constant pressure and velocity for some time .",
    "surprisingly , an easy argument shows that the states in @xmath35 can still be used to produce periodic weak solutions starting with @xmath36 .",
    "this leaves the difficulty of choosing a proper subset @xmath37 with sufficient large @xmath32 hull . in general the computation of @xmath32 hull",
    "might be rather complicated . in this work",
    "we argue differently to suggest a more systematic method : instead of fixing a set and computing the hull , we pick a reasonable matrix @xmath38 and compute @xmath39 .",

    "this is the first time they are used to produce exact solutions .",
    "then , we are able to choose the set @xmath44 carefully so that the construction is stable and allow us to solve the inclusion .",
    "our proof of this later fact is related , to the known ways of solving differential inclusions based on @xmath42 configuration @xcite but we have made an effort to keep the whole paper self contained . in particular we do not appeal to the general theory of laminates @xcite to minimize the amount of new terminology and make the construction more explicit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the de lellis - szkelyhidi approach to obtain weak solutions to a nonlinear pde .",
    "section 3 is devoted to put ipm in this framework , the computation of the wave cone and the corresponding potentials .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the geometry part of the construction and section 5 to the analytic one . in this last section",
    "we include some remarks about the nature of our solution as well as why this approach seems to fail for constructing weak solutions compactly supported in space and time .",
    "the strategy to construct wild solutions to a non linear pde , understanding it as a differential inclusion , builds upon the following main steps . consider the equation and @xmath45 are suitable spaces dimensions that we keep general at this point . ]",

    "then one considers new states variables @xmath55 which clearly satisfy the conservation law .",

    "[ irregularity ] the boundary values ( or initial data ) are attained in the weak sense .",
    "namely we use the fact ( see @xcite ) that a solution to @xmath399 can be redefined in a set of times of measure zero in a way that the map @xmath490 is continuous .",
    "since for negative @xmath491 @xmath492 we obtain the desired @xmath493 and we can argue similarly for the density . from this point of view it is not surprising that @xmath494 but @xmath495 since they are weak limits and weak limits do not commute with products .",
    "in fact from this we deduce that our solutions do not attain the boundary values in the strong sense and hence by the frechet kolmogorov theorem they are highly irregular .",
    "another additional feature of the weak solution is that @xmath496 for a.e . @xmath497 which prevents the pointwise convergence to the initial data .",
    "we conclude with a proposition pointing out to the fact that this method does not seem to yield a solution compact in space and time . for that we need some more standard terminology .",
