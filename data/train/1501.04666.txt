    "the strong nuclear interaction which is usually understood as the interaction between two nucleons is by now quite well known .",
    "however , the interaction is mediated by mesons which are also strongly interacting objects and it makes sense to have a good understanding of the meson - nucleon and especially the meson - nucleus interaction too .",
    "hadron - nuclear interactions in general can be probed either via scattering experiments or the study of bound states .",
    "it has been possible to investigate the pion - nucleus interaction through elastic scattering experiments , but the same is not true of the heavier eta meson due to its being extremely short lived . due to the non - availability of eta beams , the eta - nucleon ( @xmath0-n )",
    "interaction can only be deduced via the eta - nucleon or eta - nucleus interaction in the final state .",
    "fortunately , its interaction with the nucleon in the @xmath1-wave ( which proceeds through the formation of an n@xmath2(1535 ) resonance ) is attractive and leads to the possibility of forming and studying unstable bound states of eta mesons and nuclei @xcite ( see also @xcite for an extensive list of references ) .",
    "after about 25 years of investigations in this field , a lot of progress has been made and some evidence for the existence of such states exists , however , there still does not exist a general agreement and a final word on the strength of the eta - nucleon and eta - nucleus interaction .",
    "the eta meson being heavy with a mass around 547 mev , reactions producing eta mesons on nuclei involve large momentum transfers to the nuclei involved .",
    "this fact gives rise to the possibility of reaction mechanisms @xcite which go beyond the one step process where a single nucleon gets excited to the n@xmath2 resonance which eventually decays into an @xmath0 and a nucleon @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-n and hence the @xmath0-nucleus interaction can be deduced only from reactions where the @xmath0 is produced in the final state .",
    "such a deduction then depends on the theoretical model used for the reaction mechanism for production as well as the final state interaction of the @xmath0 meson with the nucleus . a theoretical prediction for the existence of an eta - mesic unstable nuclear state which requires the strength of the @xmath0-n interaction as an input , thus depends indirectly on the correctness of the reaction mechanisms describing the production reactions . besides this , the strong effects of the @xmath0-nucleus interaction are prominent near the threshold of the eta producing reactions where the off - shell rescattering of the eta and the nucleus becomes important .",
    "methods based on the extraction of the eta - nucleus scattering length ( which is further used to comment on the possible existence of eta mesic nuclei ) involving on - shell approximations can indeed lead to quite different conclusions as compared to few body calculations of the same . here",
    ", an attempt to compare such discrepancies and look back at the deficiencies in explaining the meson production data will be made .",
    "the next section begins with a brief introduction to the methods of identifying unstable states focussing especially on the application of a quantum time concept introduced by wigner and eisenbud @xcite and modified recently for locating eta mesic nuclear states @xcite .",
    "the sections which follow , discuss the experimental searches , the limitations of some of the theoretical approaches and possibilities for the future .",
    "baryon resonances are usually identified by performing a partial wave analysis of the elastic meson baryon scattering data and obtaining the energy dependent amplitude ( or transition matrix ) by fitting cross section data .",
    "resonances are then determined by locating the poles of the s - matrix on the unphysical sheet and studying the argand diagrams of this complex transition matrix . with the eta meson being",
    "extremely short lived ( @xmath3 @xmath4 10@xmath5 s ) , the possibility of performing such analyses with elastic @xmath0-n or eta - nucleus elastic scattering data does not exist . hence the next best thing to do in a theoretical search is to use the information on the @xmath0-n interaction obtained from models fitting the @xmath0 meson producing reaction data and use it as an input to theoretically construct a complex eta - nucleus elastic scattering matrix .",
    "the poles of this matrix in the complex energy / momentum plane can then be used to infer on the existence of unstable states .",
    "the complex energy @xmath6 is related to the complex momentum @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath0-nucleus reduced mass .",
    "the physical and unphysical sheets correspond to @xmath10 m @xmath11 0 and @xmath12 0 respectively . denoting @xmath13e @xmath14 and @xmath10 m @xmath15 , @xmath16 and hence , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for the existence of a bound ( or quasibound )",
    "state , the requirement is @xmath19 .",
    "this means that for a quasibound state to exist , @xmath20 and for @xmath21 , the pole , of the type @xmath22 should lie in the second quadrant ( see figure 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the complex @xmath7 plane above the diagonal which divides this quadrant into two . as @xmath23 ,",
    "the pole lies on the positive imaginary @xmath7 axis and corresponds to a bound state .",
    "the virtual state pole lies on the negative imaginary @xmath7 axis .",
    "resonances are defined as the states on the unphysical sheet ( @xmath10 m @xmath24 ) with @xmath25 , i.e. a pole of the type @xmath26 .",
    "quasivirtual states lie on the unphysical sheet too , but with a pole like @xmath27 , they lead to an exponential growth and not decay and hence are not physical unstable states .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleus transition matrix can also be used to evaluate the so - called time delay ( a concept initially introduced by wigner and eisenbud @xcite and elaborated by smith and many others later @xcite ) which is large and positive with a typical lorentzian ( breit - wigner type ) shape at positive and negative energies for resonances and quasibound states respectively .",
    "virtual and quasivirtual states lead to negative delay times @xcite .",
    "a variation of this concept , namely , the dwell time delay which is useful for identifying unstable states near threshold was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the relation between the dwell and phase time delay , @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , in scattering was found to be @xmath30 \\,\\,dk / de\\,.\\ ] ] where the phase time delay is given in terms of the @xmath31-matrix as @xmath32 $ ] , with , @xmath33 .",
    "since time delay is the difference in the time spent by the scattering objects in a given region with and without interaction , an attractive interaction would be expected to  delay \" the process whereas a repulsive one would cause the time spent with interaction to be smaller and hence cause the difference to be negative .",
    "thus a large positive time delay signals the existence of an unstable bound ( quasibound ) state or a resonance which is formed , propagates and decays delaying the process .",
    "a time delay analysis in @xcite led the authors to conclude that only small @xmath0-n scattering lengths favour the formation of light quasibound eta mesic nuclei .",
    "a large scattering length such as @xmath36 fm which in principle is the value which reproduces the p d @xmath37 @xmath34he @xmath0 reaction data well @xcite leads to a ( positive energy ) @xmath0-@xmath34he resonance and a strong repulsion near the threshold for @xmath0-@xmath35he states ( in agreement with absence of quasibound states as found in @xcite )",
    ". a quasibound state such as that claimed in @xcite and later withdrawn @xcite can be formed only with a small @xmath0-n scattering length .",
    "in fact , the authors @xcite noticed a movement of the poles from a relatively deep quasibound state at ( - 5 - @xmath38 8) mev to one near threshold at ( 0 - @xmath38 1.95 ) mev and then a resonance at ( 0.5 + @xmath38 0.65 ) mev , for increasing values of the scattering length , @xmath39 = ( 0.28 + @xmath380.19 ) fm , ( 0.51 + @xmath38 0.26 ) fm and ( 0.88 + @xmath38 0.41 ) fm respectively .",
    "one of the hints for the possible existence of eta mesic @xmath34he was the rapid increase of the magnitude of the @xmath1-wave amplitude in the p d @xmath37",
    "@xmath34he @xmath0 reaction near threshold . in @xcite",
    "the authors showed that the phase of the @xmath1-wave amplitude varies strongly near threshold too .",
    "considering contributions of the @xmath1 and @xmath7 waves , the authors found that the angular distribution of this reaction is sensitive to the @xmath1-@xmath7 interference .",
    "they associated the sharp rise in the total cross sections with the existence of a pole corresponding to either a quasibound or a quasivirtual state very close to threshold ( @xmath40 mev ) .    in a much earlier work @xcite , within a watson - like multiple scattering formalism , the authors tried to simultaneously analyse the p d @xmath37 @xmath34he @xmath0 as well as the d d @xmath37 @xmath35he @xmath0 data in order to investigate the existence of eta - mesic helium nuclei . with the @xmath0-n interaction not being well - known , they studied the existence of such states for various values of the @xmath0-n scattering length .",
    "the authors concluded that though @xmath0-@xmath34he quasibound states would be less likely to exist , @xmath0-@xmath35he states could possibly exist . in passing , we also mention ref .",
    "@xcite , where , based on a scattering length approximation for the final state interaction and with a simultaneous fit to the d d @xmath37 @xmath35he @xmath0 and p d @xmath37 @xmath34he @xmath0 data the authors determined @xmath41 fm , and @xmath42 fm indicating the existence of both @xmath0-@xmath34he and @xmath0-@xmath35he states .",
    "conclusions about the existence of eta mesic states based on scattering length approaches for the final state should however be taken with some caution as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "some hope of shedding light on the existence of these light nuclear states lies in the ongoing efforts made by the wasa collaboration at cosy @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients of any theoretical analysis of an @xmath0 meson producing reaction on nuclei are ( i ) a model for the reaction mechanism to produce an @xmath0 in the final state ( ii ) a framework to incorporate the @xmath0-nucleus final state interaction ( fsi ) and ( iii ) information on the interaction of the @xmath0 meson with the nucleons within the nucleus . the large momentum transfer to the nucleus involved in these reactions rules out the possibility of using a simple model where the @xmath0 is produced directly from the decay of the @xmath43 resonance in a one step process .",
    "since data on @xmath0 production have confirmed the existence of strong fsi effects near threshold , it is also important to notice that the @xmath0 meson can in principle be produced off - shell and brought on - shell ( after several rescatterings ) by its fsi with the nucleus .",
    "below , we try to analyse the deficiencies in literature in the treatment of these three main ingredients in the search of eta mesic nuclei .",
    "with the eta mass being around 547 mev , the momentum transferred to the nucleus is large .",
    "laget and lecolley noticed the need for a three - body mechanism where the momentum is shared by the nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "indeed , they found that @xcite a one - body mechanism underestimated the cross sections by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "faeldt and wilkin @xcite found good agreement with the threshold data on the p d @xmath37 @xmath34he @xmath0 reaction using the so called two step model where one nucleon in the deuteron first interacts with the incident proton to produce an intermediate pion which eventually produces the eta meson via the @xmath44 n @xmath37 @xmath0 n reaction .",
    "the transition amplitude for the two step process can be then written as @xcite , @xmath45 where the sum runs over the spin projections of the intermediate off - shell particles and @xmath46 is the four momentum of the intermediate pion . motivated by the success of this model , in @xcite",
    "the final state @xmath0-@xmath34he interaction was incorporated using few body equations which took into account the off shell rescattering of the @xmath0 from the nucleus .",
    "thus latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{tmat2 } & & < \\psi_{f } ( \\vec{k_{\\eta}})|t_{pd \\rightarrow ^3{\\rm he}\\,\\eta}|   \\psi_i(\\vec { k_p } ) > \\ ,   = \\ , < \\,\\vec{k_\\eta } ;   m_3|\\ , t_{p",

    "though such a model could reproduce the threshold total cross sections as well as the isotropic angular distributions , it was later found @xcite to produce backward peaked angular distributions at high energies in complete disagreement with data . indeed , backward peaked angular distributions seem to be a common feature of high momentum transfer reactions ( like for example , p d @xmath37 @xmath34he @xmath48 , p d @xmath37 @xmath34h@xmath49 @xmath50 ) described within a two step model @xcite .",
    "improved calculations including coupled channel effects arising for example from the p d @xmath37",
    "@xmath34he @xmath51 reaction , the interaction of the off - shell intermediate particles with the inclusion of higher partial waves could lead to a better understanding of the problem .",
    "the latter is supported by @xcite where the authors found the angular distributions sensitive to the @xmath1-@xmath7 wave interference .      in a proper description of the fsi between the @xmath0 and the nucleus",
    ", one must consider the fact that the @xmath0 meson can also be produced off the mass shell and eventually brought on - shell due to its interaction with the nucleus .",
    "the half off - shell transition matrix can be written using few body equations . in @xcite",
    "the off - shell fsi included using few body equations was found to be important for the p d @xmath37 @xmath34he @xmath0 , p @xmath52li @xmath37 @xmath53be @xmath0 and p n @xmath37 d @xmath0 reactions .",
    "the eta nucleus scattering lengths deduced from such off shell t - matrices are also found to be quite different @xcite from those using a rather simple on shell approximation with the fsi amplitude given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 fitted to reproduce the right magnitude of the data .",
    "it is surely tempting to use a simple approximation as the above expression to extract eta - nucleus scattering lengths from eta production data and comment on the existence of eta mesic states based on the magnitude and sign of the scattering length .",
    "however , such conclusions could indeed be way away from reality .",
    "we started off with the aim of understanding the eta meson - nucleon interaction and having obtained indications of its attractive nature we set out on a search of its exotic nuclear states , namely , the eta mesic nuclei .",
    "however , extensive investigations of hadron and photon induced @xmath0 producing reactions over the past decades have left us with a less clear understanding of the strength of the @xmath0-nucleon interaction than what we started with .",
    "the very first prediction @xcite was that of a small scattering length , @xmath39 , of 0.28 + @xmath38 0.19 fm .",
    "interestingly , a more recent calculation @xcite involving nine baryon resonances and the @xmath44 n , @xmath0 n , @xmath56 n and @xmath57 n coupled channels finds @xmath39 = 0.3 + @xmath38 0.18 fm in close agreement to the very first prediction .",
    "the latest coupled channel analysis @xcite of the @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 reactions , however , yielded @xmath39 = 0.49 + @xmath38 0.24 fm and 0.55 + @xmath38 0.24 fm from different fits .",
    "based on the theoretical and phenomenological predictions in literature , one finds that the @xmath0 n scattering length varies over a wide range of values given by , 0.18 @xmath62 1.03 fm and 0.16 @xmath63 0.49 fm .    to summarize briefly",
    "one can say that a crucial step forward for eta mesic physics lies in determining more accurately , the strength of the @xmath0 n interaction , from data on elementary @xmath0 meson producing reactions .",
    "this would help in improving the theoretical predictions for eta - mesic states and focussing the experimental searches on to specific nuclei and reactions .",
