    "the periodic anderson model ( pam ) is the minimal model for the investigation of interacting , localized electrons ( e.g. , @xmath0-electrons ) hybridizing with a non - interacting band of conduction electrons as in the rare earths and actinides .",
    "indeed , the pam can explain many of the characteristic properties of heavy fermion systems,@xcite intermediate valence materials,@xcite and kondo insulators.@xcite while it is well known that the pam can account for the long - range antiferromagnetic correlations at and near half - filling of the conduction band , ferromagnetic phases of this model have received less attention .",
    "nevertheless , ferromagnetism induced by localized@xcite and even slightly delocalized@xcite @xmath0-electrons is now known to be a generic property of this model away from half - filling .",
    "in fact , there exist a number of @xmath0-electron materials with ferromagnetic phases , e.g. , ucu@xmath7si@xmath7,@xcite ucu@xmath7ge@xmath7,@xcite cerh@xmath8b@xmath7,@xcite ybnisn,@xcite urhsi,@xcite urhge,@xcite and cerupo.@xcite since the ions providing the @xmath0-electrons in these systems are rather far apart , their hybridization with conduction electrons must be considered essential for the stabilization of ferromagnetism .",
    "this makes the pam an appropriate model for the investigation of these systems .",
    "the conventional pam does not take into account any degeneracies of the electrons , e.g. , the fact that without crystal field splitting the @xmath0-orbitals have a seven - fold degeneracy .",
    "this degeneracy can be expected to influence the magnetic properties of materials .",
    "for example , in the case of the hubbard model band - degeneracy is known to greatly enhance ferromagnetism due to presence of hund s rule couplings.@xcite therefore , a more realistic study of ferromagnetism in the pam should explicitly consider band and orbital degeneracies of the electrons.@xcite in this paper , we present a detailed study of the influence of band degeneracy of the conduction band and/or orbital degeneracy of the localized levels on the stability of ferromagnetism in the pam for different conduction electron densities . for this purpose",
    "we employ the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) with quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) as the impurity solver .",
    "in particular , we show that , and explain why , @xmath3 increases with the degeneracy of the @xmath0-level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the model and the calculation method in detail .",
    "the result of the magnetization , magnetic susceptibility , and phase diagrams in the pam with degeneracy are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] .",
    "a summary is presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the multi - orbital pam investigated here has the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) creates conduction ( localized ) electrons with orbital @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and spin @xmath14 at site @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath16 is the hopping parameter of the conduction electron , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the center of the conduction band and the energy level of the @xmath0-electrons , respectively .",
    "the orbital index can take the values @xmath19 for the conduction band and @xmath20 for the @xmath0-level . in this paper , we consider only degenerate bands , i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the intra- and inter - orbital coulomb repulsion , respectively , @xmath26 is the ising component of the hund s rule coupling , and @xmath27 represents the hybridization between the conduction band and the localized orbital . for the conduction band",
    "we assume a bethe density of states ( dos ) with @xmath28 per spin .",
    "the bandwidth of the conduction band ( @xmath29 ) defines the energy scale .",
    "we note that the magnetic properties of the pam do not seem to depend on the specific shape of the non - interacting dos , since a gaussian dos gives qualitatively similar results.@xcite in this paper we fix the interactions , the hybridization , and the chemical potential at the values @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively . for the latter choice of @xmath35 ,",
    "the @xmath0-level is approximately half - filled,@xcite thus permitting local moments to be formed .    in the local moment regime of the pam ferromagnetism",
    "is due to the magnetic interaction between the localized magnetic moments mediated by the non - interacting conduction electrons .",
    "while a strong hybridization increases the magnetic interaction , it simultaneously weakens the magnetic moments . for this reason , static mean - field theories or perturbative approaches do not describe ferromagnetic solutions of the pam adequately . here",
    "the dmft @xcite has proved to be a reliable non - perturbative investigation scheme .",
    "the dmft is based on the limit of infinite dimensions of the lattice , where the many - body problem reduces to a local one and can , in principle , be solved exactly.@xcite    the structure of the dmft self - consistency equations for the pam is the same as that for the hubbard model , except for the calculation of the lattice green function through the @xmath36-integrated dyson equation,@xcite which now reads @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the self - energy of the @xmath0-electron with orbital @xmath13 and spin @xmath14 , and @xmath39 is the number of @xmath36 points in the summation .",
    "the green functions are represented as a function of the matsubara frequency @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "then , the bath green function is determined by the self - consistency condition @xmath42^{-1}$ ] , and the green function is obtained by solving the effective single - impurity problem using qmc.@xcite this qmc - method involves a time discretization @xmath43 and subsequent extrapolation @xmath44 . in the present work we do not extrapolate in every case , and mostly work with @xmath45 , because we are mainly interested in the qualitative behavior of @xmath3 . as will be shown later the value of @xmath3 calculated with @xmath45",
    "is within a few percent of the value obtained by the extrapolation @xmath46 . for small @xmath24 ( smaller than the bandwidth )",
    "the resulting error is small . as @xmath24 increases",

    "the magnetic susceptibility was calculated from the two - particle correlation function.@xcite it can also be obtained from the magnetization in a weak magnetic field .",

    "[ fig : sus_mf](a ) . in the non - degenerate case ( @xmath48 )",
    ", the inverse susceptibility is found to be almost perfectly linear for all temperatures .",
    "a linear behavior of the inverse susceptibility near @xmath3 , i.e. , a curie - weiss mean - field behavior , does not come unexpected in dmft , although its validity was so far proved only for the single - band hubbard model.@xcite the numerical finding that this linear behavior persists up to high temperatures , i.e. , that the curie - weiss behavior merges into a curie law , is also not surprising in view of the low values of @xmath3 and a saturated magnetization in the magnetic phase .    for increasing degeneracy @xmath4 ,",
    "the inverse susceptibility becomes more and more non - linear . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sus_mf](b ) , this is not due to the finite value of @xmath58 since an extrapolation @xmath59 does not change the result .",
    "a non - linear behavior of the susceptibility is also seen in the orbitally degenerate hubbard model.@xcite this non - linear behavior , i.e. , the change of slope with temperature , is due to the decrease of the effective magnetic moment @xmath60 with temperature .",
    "this effect is negligible in the non - degenerate case ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "by contrast , in the degenerate case the spins of the localized electrons are aligned parallel due to the hund s rule coupling near @xmath3 ( which is here found to be low ) such that the effective magnetic moment becomes large . on the other hand , at high temperatures the effective magnetic moment decreases since the electrons become independent and the spin of the localized electron takes a random orientation on every site , owing to the thermal fluctuation .",
    "accordingly , the decrease of the effective magnetic moment with increasing temperature leads to an increase of the slope of the inverse susceptibility .",
    "this explains the upturn of the inverse susceptibility for increasing temperature .",
    "the non - linearity of @xmath47 has to be taken into account in the calculation of @xmath3 from the inverse susceptibility .",
    "namely , a purely linear fitting of @xmath47 would lead to a serious error in the value of @xmath3 .",
    "we found the inverse susceptibility to be well fitted by @xmath61 the linear behavior is restored again at high temperatures , i.e. , above the fermi temperature ( curie law ) .",
    "the two linear regimes at high temperatures and near @xmath3 are smoothly connected .",

    "[ fig : tc ] for several values of the @xmath0-level ( @xmath4 ) and conduction band ( @xmath69 ) degeneracy .",
    "the most remarkable feature is the pronounced increase of @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "this behavior can be explained by the increase of the local magnetic moment .",
    "namely , the hund s rule coupling aligns the local magnetic moments on each site whereby the magnitude of the local moment , @xmath70 , increases with the degeneracy @xmath4 ; @xmath3 then increases accordingly .",
    "by contrast , the degeneracy of the conduction band has a different effect : for increasing @xmath69 the conduction electron density giving the maximal @xmath3 ( i.e. , the  optimal \" density ) also increases whereby the ferromagnetic phase expands to higher @xmath2 values . at the same time",
    "@xmath3 is hardly affected . for @xmath71 , however , @xmath3 almost always decreases with increasing @xmath69 .",

    ", width=321 ]    in order to explain the general dependence of @xmath3 on the degeneracy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc ] we modify the _ ansatz _ that we recently introduced in the case of the disordered pam without degeneracy,@xcite which has the form @xmath73 . here",
    "the two functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 describe the formation of the local @xmath0-electron moments and the mediation of the magnetic ordering by @xmath76-electrons , respectively . since @xmath77 is fixed , @xmath78 depends only on the degeneracy .",
    "according to the mean - field theory for the rkky interaction in which this _ ansatz _ is indeed justified the local moment part ( @xmath74 ) is proportional to @xmath79 , where @xmath80.@xcite the effective coulomb interaction @xmath81 is defined as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the energy with the @xmath0-electron density @xmath84.@xcite for a half - filled @xmath0-level , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath87 , @xmath74 is proportional to @xmath88 ^ 2 $ ] . as in the conduction band part , @xmath89 can be expressed by @xmath90 with @xmath91 , because @xmath92 is uniquely determined by the conduction electron density per band ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "therefore , when we plot @xmath94 ^ 2\\}$ ] as a function of @xmath95 , all curves should fall onto the same curve .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc_rescale ] .",
    "the deduced scaling behavior is seen to be obeyed surprisingly well , given the simplicity of the assumptions made in the derivation and the fact , that the parameter values employed in our investigation are not limited to the rkky regime .",
    "indeed @xmath3 increases rapidly with @xmath93 until it reaches a maximum near @xmath96 and then decreases slowly .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath3 increases with @xmath4 and is about @xmath97 ^ 2\\}$ ] . in accordance with the mean - field character of the above _ ansatz _ the curves for @xmath98",
    "are found to fulfill the scaling behavior much better than for @xmath53 . for @xmath99 , which are not plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc_rescale ] , the above _ ansatz _ does not apply .",
    "the additional conduction bands seem to impede the magnetic ordering rather than mediate it .",
    "we computed the ferromagnetic susceptibility of the periodic anderson model ( pam ) , and from that the curie temperature @xmath3 , for different values of the conduction band and @xmath0-level degeneracies as well as electron densities @xmath2 within dmft .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility was found to deviate from the curie - weiss behavior away from @xmath3 , an effect which becomes stronger with increasing degeneracy of the @xmath0-level .",
    "our results show that the degeneracy affects the ferromagnetic stability of the pam strongly .",
    "in particular , for @xmath5 the value of @xmath3 ( i ) increases with the @xmath0-level degeneracy , ( ii ) approximately obeys a scaling law as a function of the conduction electron density per band @xmath95 , which can be understood within a mean - field picture of the rkky interaction , and ( iii ) becomes maximal for @xmath6 .",
    "this shows that realistic investigations of correlated electron materials with localized @xmath0-levels must employ appropriate generalizations of the pam where the multi - orbital character of the electrons is taken into account .",
