    "this dephasing representation expresses fidelity as an interference integral , with weight of each term given by the wigner function and the phase by the integrated perturbation along an unperturbed trajectory .",
    "in particular , no analog of the van vleck determinant is needed . as the original specialized expression ( [ fid_pos_loc ] ) from ref .",

    "second , on the example of coherent superpositions of states , it was shown that oscillatory patterns in the wigner function are important : therefore classical phase space distribution , resulting from incoherent superposition of component wigner distributions ( for states for which these are the same as classical distributions ) .",
    "this may shed some further light on the controversial issue of importance of sub - plank structures on decoherence @xcite .",
    "finally , it was shown that dr is also accurate for mixed states : incoherent superpositions and completely random states .",
    "all tests were performed on a system with mixed phase space : with both integrable and chaotic regions .",
