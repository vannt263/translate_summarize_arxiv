    "the standard model of cosmology known as @xmath0cdm is established as a cornerstone of modern cosmology . the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite and large scale structure ( lss ) surveys",
    "@xcite indicate that almost all observations can be described by a 6-parameter @xmath0cdm model with an initial condition of almost gaussian , isotropic , scale invariant and adiabatic perturbations which can be sourced during inflation @xcite .",
    "recent observations of planck collaboration shows almost no deviation from standard picture of single field slow roll inflation @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the bicep2/keck - planck results shows that there is no detection of gravitational waves @xcite . despite the success of the standard model , the physics of early universe , the natures of dark matter and dark energy are still unknown .",
    "the large scale structure surveys open a new horizon to test the cosmological models in different redshifts and sub - cmb scales .",
    "one of the recent developments of the field is the detection of the lensed cmb map with unprecedented accuracy @xcite .",
    "the cmb lensing is caused by the gravitational effect of structures in the line of sight of the photons from the last scattering surface @xcite .",
    "each ray of cmb is deflected due to gravitational lensing effect and accordingly we observe the temperature of each point on the lensed cmb map , @xmath1 , as a map of the temperature in a nearby point @xmath2 ( note that in this work a quantity accompanied with the symbol @xmath3 represents the corresponding lensed quantity ) .",
    "the lensing potential encapsulates all information on the deflection of light bundle due to lensing and it is related to the integrated potential of the matter distribution in all redshift up to the surface of last scattering .",
    "the calculation of the two point statistics in lensed cmb maps can be a probe of the matter distribution ( matter power spectrum ) in the universe .",
    "accordingly , the cmb lensing is a unique observational tool to constrain the cosmological models , specially the evolution of the growth of the structures @xcite .",
    "the cmb lensing can not only change the temperature map of cmb but also it can change the polarization maps by being a new source of b - mode polarization @xcite .",
    "in addition , it introduces non - gaussianities @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to study the primordial universe , we should subtract the effects of cmb lensing on cmb map correctly in order to avoid the degeneracies @xcite .",
    "having said that , the cmb lensing in its own can be used as a unique observational tool to constrain the physics of early universe @xcite .",
    "it can probe the curvature perturbations power spectrum and capture any deviation from standard assumptions .",
    "in this work we use the cmb lensing as a probe of early universe physics , specially to study the effects of deviation from scale invariant and isotropic initial conditions .",
    "this is motivated from the fact that there are indications of anomalies in cmb data ( like power deficit , cold spot , alignment of quadrupole and octupole @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the planck data indicates the existence of hemispherical asymmetry in primordial power spectrum @xcite , first seen in wmap data @xcite , and also verified with the local variance estimator @xcite .",
    "if these anomalies are not the statistical flukes , then it is worth to investigate their effects on cmb- and lss - related observations in order to understand their origins .",

    "the cross - correlation of cmb lensing with cosmic shear is the subject of the study in the second sub - section .",

    "we assume that @xmath15 , which is the case if the cosmic fluid does not have anisotropic stress and general relativity ( gr ) is the correct classical theory of gravity .",
    "the light source from a distant objects in universe is distracted by the intervening structures before the line of sight . a crucial parameter that shows the amount of convergence / deconvergence of light bundles is the lensing potential @xmath16 defined as @xcite : ( ) = -2_0^_*d ( ) ( , ) , where the integration parameter @xmath12 is the comoving distance",

    "note that @xmath23 is the angular gradient , consequently the gravitational potential , the lensing potential and the deflection angle are dimensionless quantities .",
    "now we can relate the two point function of the lensing potential to the power spectrum of gravitational potential in fourier space as [ eq : lenscor ] ( ) ^*()=4_0^_*d_0^_*d ( ) ( ) e^i**k.**e^-i**k. * * ( * k*,())^*(*k*,( ) ) , where @xmath24 is the fourier transform of gravitational potential .",

    "accordingly , at least to leading order , all the effects of the primordial universe are imprinted in primordial power and they can be investigated in cmb lensing .    in cmb lensing studies we can interchangeably express the lensing power in terms of the late time matter power spectrum and to test the predictions of the models for matter distribution of late time universe . in this light , cmb lensing is a probe of early universe through eq.([eq : clpsi ] ) and also the distribution of the matter in late time .    in below",

    "this has caused significant interests on theoretical and observational implications of hemispherical asymmetry .",

    "one promising approach is the idea of long mode modulations @xcite . in this picture",
    "a long mode @xmath66 , which is much bigger than the hubble radius , causes the asymmetry by modulating the background inflationary parameters such as the inflaton field or its velocity or by modulating the surface of end of inflation .",

    "we have proposed that the cmb lensing can be a prominent new observational tool to investigate the physics of initial conditions .",

    "in addition , we also suggested that the cross - correlation of cmb and galaxy lensing can also be used as a probe of initial conditions . in the case of the cross - correlation , each galaxy sample probes a different range of wavenumbers due to its corresponding kernel which is related to the distribution of the galaxies .",

    "we have proposed that both the cmb lensing potential and cmb lensing convergence can be used to probe the amplitude of dipole modulation .",

    "accordingly they can be used to address the predictions of this study .",

    "the planck data suggests a non - trivial scale - dependence for dipole amplitude in which the amplitude of dipole falls off rapidly for @xmath140 .",

    "we have used the cmb lensing convergence autocorrelation and the cosmic shear convergence cross correlation with cmb to constrain the amplitude of @xmath142 and the spectral index of dipole modulation .",
    "another example of deviation from the standard primordial initial conditions which can be tested via cmb lensing is the deviation from scale invariance .",
    "the observational data from cmb and lss show that up to scales of groups of galaxies the primordial power spectrum is scale invariant . however , there is no direct evidence that this scale invariance continues on smaller scales . in the second part of this work",
    "we have studied the question of deviation from scale invariance in the form of local feature in primordial power spectrum . in order to model this feature",
    "we have assumed a gaussian - type bump in the primordial power on small scales @xmath143 .",
    "we studied the effect of the amplitude of the bump , the location of feature in momentum space @xmath116 and the effect of the variance of gaussian bump on the cmb lensing potential and convergence .",
    "we also studied the effect of feature on the cross correlation of cmb lensing convergence and galaxy lensing .",
    "we showed that this cross correlation has the ability to probe the signals in higher moments ( small scales ) in examining the scale dependence of primordial power spectrum .",
    "there are other questions which one can study in this direction .",
    "for example , one can study the question of statistical anisotropy in primordial power spectrum .",
    "this can arise for example in models of inflation containing background vector fields and gauge fields , for a review see @xcite .",
    "because of the background vector field , the rotational symmetry is broken .",
