    "different from the schemes based on spin chains for short distance quantum communications , the principle advantage of this scheme is that , in the coupled - resonator waveguide , individual lattices sites can be addressed with optical lasers .",
    "therefore , it is much easier to switch of interactions of the qubit on which the initial state is encoded and the qubit on which the final state is received with the rest of the waveguide in this proposal .",
