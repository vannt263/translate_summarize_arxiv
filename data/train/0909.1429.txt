    "transition - metal oxides with perovskite structure and their derivatives have been intensively studied in terms of technological applications as well as fundamental physics because of their rich physical properties such as high-@xmath10 superconductivity in cu oxides and the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect in mn oxides[1 ] . in conventional perovskites ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath11 atoms randomly occupy the of perovskite structure .",
    "resultant @xmath12-site randomness reduces the onset temperature of the electronic phases , which makes its practical application difficult .",
    "therefore , it is required to reduce or remove such @xmath12-site randomness for realizing its practical application .    perovskite oxides with @xmath12-site ordered structures , which are free from @xmath12-site randomness , are promising candidates for electronic devices using their functionality .",
    "owing to @xmath12-site cation ordering , the electronic phase transition temperatures of @xmath12-site ordered perovskites sometimes exceed room temperature .",
    "for example , @xmath12-site ordered @xmath0bamn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath0 = y - sm ) is reported to undergo charge / orbital ordering transition at @xmath9 = 500 - 380  k[2,3 ] . in the electronic phase diagram for @xmath12-site ordered @xmath0bamn@xmath5o@xmath6 , the ferromagnetic metallic ( fm ) , charge / orbital ordered insulating ( coi ) , and @xmath12-type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phases compete with each other in a multicritical manner at @xmath0 = nd[3 ] .",
    "mixture of @xmath0 and ba , i.e. , @xmath12-site disordering considerably suppresses these ordered phases .",
    "consequently , large phase fluctuation is induced near the multicritical point of @xmath0 = nd .",
    "such large phase fluctuation is significant for the cmr effect[4,5 ] . in this study , in order to clarify the @xmath0-site randomness effect on @xmath12-site ordered @xmath0bamn@xmath1o@xmath2 , we have investigated the magnetic and transport properties of y@xmath3la@xmath4bamn@xmath5o@xmath6 ( 0 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath7 1 ) in which @xmath0 ( y , la ) and ba are regularly arranged while y and la randomly occupy the @xmath0-site .",

    "the magnetization of @xmath8 = 0.4 shows a slight increase below @xmath19150  k. with an increase in @xmath8 from 0.4 , the ferromagnetic correlation is steeply developing . as shown in the inset of fig.1(b ) , dlog@xmath13/d@xmath14 of @xmath8 = 0.4 and 0.45 show clear anomalies at 390  k and 360  k , respectively , below which the resistivities of @xmath8 = 0.4 and 0.45 are insulating .",

    "the appreciable mr is not observed in y@xmath3la@xmath4bamn@xmath5o@xmath6 ( 0 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath7 0.45 ) , indicating that the coi phase is robust against external magnetic fields .",

    "figure 2(a ) presents the magnetization curve of @xmath8 = 0.7 at 5  k. ferromagnetic behavior is observed in the magnetization curve , but the ferromagnetic moment is much lower than the expected value of 3.5@xmath21@xmath22/mn - site .",

    "= 0.7 , the first - order magnetic transition accompanied by thermal hysteresis is seen around 200  k. it should be noted that both the @xmath12-type afm and coi transitions are of first - order , accompanying the decrease in the magnetization .",

    "the steep decrease of magnetization observed in ndbamn@xmath5o@xmath6 at 250  k for cooling is due to the onset of the @xmath12-type afm transition[4 ] .",
    "since the ionic radius of ( y@xmath23la@xmath24 ) is close to that of pr , and the coi phase is fragile against chemical disorder , the magnetic anomaly of @xmath8 = 0.7 around 200  k is likely due to the @xmath12-type afm transition .",
    "relatively large magnetic moment of @xmath8 = 0.7 below @xmath18 suggests that the fm , and @xmath12-type afm ( or @xmath20-type ) phases coexist .",
    "figure 2(c ) displays the electronic phase diagram for y@xmath3la@xmath4bamn@xmath5o@xmath6 as a function of the average ionic radius of the @xmath0-site , or equivalently the variation of @xmath8 .",
