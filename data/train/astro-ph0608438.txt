    "red supergiants ( rsgs ) are evolved , moderately massive ( 1030 m@xmath1 ) he - burning stars . as such",
    ", they are key agents of nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of the galaxy , and have also long been known for their slow optical variations .",
    "this variability is usually attributed to radial pulsations ( stothers 1969 , wood , bessell & fox 1983 , heger et al .",
    "1997 , guo & li 2002 ) , although irregular variability caused by huge convection cells was also suggested from theory ( schwarzschild 1975 , antia et al .  1984 ) and observations ( e.g. tuthill , haniff & baldwin 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of oscillations , in principle , offers the possibility of asteroseismology , i.e. measuring frequencies of stars and then identifying the modes of pulsations via comparing the observations to theoretical models .",
    "however , the time scales involved in rsgs makes this approach very difficult .",
    "model calculations predict pulsational instability for fundamental and low - order overtone modes ( stothers 1972 , wood , bessell & fox 1983 , heger et al .",
    "1997 , guo & li 2002 ) , with fundamental periods ranging from 150 to 4,000 days .",
    "consequently , any meaningful period determination may require decades of observations .",
    "here we analyse a homogeneous sample of rsg light curves with a typical time - span of over 22,000 days , which is the longest available observational data for these objects .",
    "significant interest in rsg pulsations was driven by the discovery of their distinct period - luminosity ( p  l ) relation .",
    "although the relation is not as tight as for cepheids or red giant stars , various authors pointed out that because of their great intrinsic brightnesses , rsgs might be useful as extragalactic distance indicators ( e.g. glass 1979 , feast et al .",
    "1980 , wood & bessell 1985 ) .",
    "a recent example is that of pierce et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who re - calibrated the rsg p ",
    "l relation in the near - infrared and then measured the distance to m101 from 42 rsgs in that galaxy ( jurcevic et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this",
    "respect , galactic rsgs that are members of young o ",
    "b associations are particularly important because they can serve as local calibrators of the p ",
    "l relation  provided that reliable periods can be measured .",
    "establishing this zero point is one of the by - products of this paper .    until recently , there was a serious discrepancy between evolutionary models and the empirical hertzsprung  russell diagram of rsgs",
    ". in particular , stellar evolutionary models seemed unable to produce rsgs that are as cool or as luminous as observed ( massey 2003 , massey & olsen 2003 ) .",
    "a solution was found by levesque et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who derived a new ( hotter ) temperature scale from optical spectrophotometry for 74 galactic rsgs , so that most of the discrepancy was removed .",
    "in addition , massey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argued that circumstellar dust around rsgs may account for many magnitudes of extra extinction compared to other stars in the same o ",
    "b associations , so that determining fundamental physical parameters can be quite difficult even for the brightest rsgs .",
    "the problem is very well illustrated , for instance , by the peculiar rsg vy  cma , for which previous radius estimates of up to 2,800 r@xmath1 ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) were scaled down to 600 r@xmath1 ( massey , levesque & plez 2006 ) , due to the hotter temperature scale alone .",
    "these wildly different parameter values could be tested if pulsation mode identification was made possible , which is another motivation for this work .    in the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs , kholopov et al .",
    "1985 - 1988 ) there are two categories of variable rsgs : src and lc .",
    "src type stars are semiregular late - type supergiants with amplitudes of about 1 mag and periods from 30 days to several thousand days .",
    "in contrast , lc type stars are irregular variable supergiants having visual amplitudes of about 1 mag . as the distinction between _ semiregular _ and",
    "_ irregular _ behaviour is not well defined in the literature , stars in both categories can possibly reveal important information .",
    "so far , the most detailed study of bright galactic rsg variables as a group was that by stothers & leung ( 1971 ) , who discussed periods , luminosities and masses for 22 stars .",
    "their periods were either taken from papers published in the 1950s or ( for 8 stars ) determined by the authors using visual data .",
    "for some stars , such as @xmath2  ori , @xmath2  her and @xmath3  cep , one can find more recent attempts to derive period(s ) using various sources of photometric or radial velocity data ( e.g. mantegazza 1982 , smith , patten & goldberg 1989 , percy et al .",
    "1996 , brelstaff et al .",
    "1997 , rinehart et al .  2000 ) .",
    "however , the typical time - span of analysed observations rarely exceeded 1015 years and usually with many gaps , thus the derived periods ( or mean cycle lengths ) did not always agree .",
    "the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) has been collecting visual observations of variable stars for almost a century .",
    "the aavso database is by far the biggest one of its kind , containing over 12 million individual brightness estimates for about 6,000 variable stars . of these , roughly 50 stars are reasonably well - observed bright galactic rsgs of the gcvs types src and lc . using their observational records in the aavso database ,",
    "we have carried out a period and light curve analysis of this group of stars .",
    "the main aim was to derive periods for all variables .",
    "however , it turned out that in some cases the light curves had long enough time - span to study the long - term behaviour of their brightness fluctuations",
    ". therefore , in addition to determining the dominant time - scales , we also discuss the nature and extent of the irregularities .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",

    ", we checked the asas observations of the star and found that the 952 d period is an error . for st  cep and xx  per our data have significantly longer time - span , so that the newly determined values are likely to be more accurate .",
    "we have attempted to confirm the red supergiant status of stars in our sample .",
    "the minimum absolute bolometric magnitude for red supergiants is about @xmath4 mag ( meynet & maeder 2003 ) , which can be translated to @xmath5 mag using the relation @xmath6 that connects extinction - corrected bolometric and @xmath7-band magnitudes ( josselin et al .",
    "2000 ) . in our sample ,",
    "bolometric magnitudes were recently determined for 18 stars by levesque et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and of these only st  cep is located near the minimum luminosity , with @xmath8 mag .",
    "a few stars have useful hipparcos parallaxes ( @xmath2  ori , @xmath2  sco , @xmath2  her , ce  tau ) , and all are at least 1 mag brighter than @xmath9 mag .",
    "a particularly interesting star is @xmath2  her because its period ( 125 d ) is very short for a supergiant star .",
    "for instance , jura & kleinmann ( 1990 ) rejected all red supergiant candidates with periods less than 150 d , although it was clearly established from long - period variables in the large magellanic cloud that the least luminous red supergiants can have periods between 100 and 150 d ( wood , bessell & fox 1983 ) . for @xmath2  her , @xmath10 mag ( richichi & percheron 2002 ) and @xmath11 mas ( esa 1997 ) , implying @xmath12 mag ,",
    "so our conclusion is that shorter periods ( @xmath13 d ) can indeed exist in rsgs .    for four stars , whose",
    "names are shown in parentheses in table  [ periods ] , the rsg class is somewhat doubtful . for uz",
    "cma , both the aavso light curve and the asas @xmath14-band observations infer a periodicity around 40 days ; the asas ccd-@xmath14 light curve is very typical of a short period red giant semiregular variable , presumably on the agb , which is also supported by the luminosity class ii .",
    "is  gem , although classified as src , has too early a spectral type ( k3ii ) and its @xmath7-band absolute magnitude is only @xmath15 mag , being consistent with the luminosity class . for t",
    "cet , the periods and their ratio of 1.87 are fairly typical for semiregular agb stars ( kiss et al .  1999 ) , and its hipparcos parallax and 2mass @xmath7 magnitude imply m@xmath16 mag , which is too faint .",
    "y  lyn is a very typical semiregular variable with a long - secondary period , which is a well - known but still poorly understood phenomenon in agb stars ( wood , olivier & kawaler 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , its @xmath7-band absolute magnitude from the hipparcos parallax and 2mass @xmath7-magnitude is only @xmath17 mag . for these reasons",
    ", hereafter we exclude these four stars from further analysis .",
    "according to the theoretical predictions , multiple periodicity may arise from multimode pulsations .",
    "radial oscillations have long been predicted by model calculations , starting from the pioneering work of stothers ( 1969 ) .",
    "two extensive investigations on pulsation properties of rsgs were recently published by heger et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and guo & li ( 2002 ) .",
    "although they treated convection in a different way ( heger et al .",
    "adopted the ledoux criterion and treated semiconvection according to langer , sugimoto & fricke ( 1983 ) ; guo & li used the mixing - length theory of bhm - vitense ( 1958 ) and adopted the schwarzschild criterion to determine the boundaries of convection and semiconvection zones ) , both studies confirmed earlier results and predicted excitation of the fundamental , first and possibly second overtone modes .",
    "the fundamental mode s growth rate always exceeded that of the overtone modes and was found to increase with luminosity for a given mass . on the other hand , studies of convection in the envelopes of red giants and supergiants showed that the dominant convective elements can be comparable in size to the stellar radius , which could explain both the observed irregular variations ( schwarzschild 1975 , antia et al .",
    "1984 ) and the hotspots on late - type supergiants , detected using interferometric techniques ( tuthill , haniff , & baldwin 1997 ) .",
    "a similar mechanism was proposed by stothers & leung ( 1971 ) for explaining the longer periods of rsg variables , arguing that the similarity of those periods and the time scale of convective turnover suggests a link between the two phenomena .",
    "interestingly , periods that are too long were also found in other luminous stars .",
    "maeder ( 1980 ) calculated empirical pulsation constants of blue - yellow supergiants , which were found to be systematically larger than the theoretical q value for the fundamental mode of radial oscillation .",
    "maeder ( 1980 ) suggested that those long periods can be due to non - radial oscillations of gravity modes .",

    "magnitude relation.,width=321 ]    a significant fraction of our sample can be characterized by two dominant periods , one of a few hundred days and one of 15002000 days .",
    "the strong similarity that we found in many cases argues for the reality of these long periods .",
    "some of the light curves are more than twice as long as those analysed by stother & leung ( 1971 ) and the fact that we derive very similar values for the long periods indicates the reliability of the results . to reveal deeper insights into the nature of the multiply periodic variations",
    ", we studied the period ",
    "luminosity distribution for all stars having a useful estimate of luminosity .",
    "to construct the period@xmath7-band absolute magnitude diagram , we took the following steps : _ ( i ) _ @xmath18 values from levesque et al .",

    "moreover , there is perfect agreement with the lmc red supergiant sample , too .",
    "@xmath3  cep and pz  cas are above the luminosity range of the models and it is possible that in those cases the longer period is the fundamental mode .",
    "rt  car and maybe ix  car seem to be too luminous for fundamental pulsation , but otherwise models strongly favour fundamental or first overtone modes for the shorter periods .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath2  her has an almost identical counterpart in the lmc , which provides a retrospective confirmation of the reality of the 125 d period .    excluding the short period of rt  car , we fitted the following period@xmath7 magnitude relation to the solid dots in fig .",

    "the long secondary periods ( lsps ) remain beyond the limits of the models , and both the updated models and the refined physical parameters of the stars keep the original conclusion on the peculiar nature of lsps by stothers & leung ( 1971 ) unchanged .",
    "they can not be explained by radial pulsations , because the period of the fundamental mode is the longest possible for that kind of oscillation .",
    "metallicity effects also can not explain the lsps .",
    "looking at the positions , for instance , @xmath2  her or @xmath2  ori , their absolute magnitudes are 12 mags fainter than those of the solar metallicity models . according to guo & li ( 2002 ) , @xmath24 , which means that unphysically large metallicities ( 10100 times solar )",
    "would be needed to account for the low luminosities .",
    "a possibility is that heavy circumstellar extinction in @xmath7-band makes the stars fainter .",
    "massey et al .",

    "nevertheless , it does appear that the shorter periods of the rsg stars mostly align better with sequence b of the low - mass stars rather than with sequence c , which would imply pulsation in the first - overtone rather than the fundamental .",

    "radius values were either taken from levesque et al .",
    "( 2005 ) or calculated from the parallax - based luminosity ( @xmath2  her and ce  tau ) and temperature ( @xmath2  her : levesque et al .  2005 ; ce  tau : wasatonic & guinan 1998 ) .",
    "masses were estimated from the approximate relation @xmath31 , which comes from evolutionary calculations ( levesque et al .",
    "2005 ) ; for this , @xmath32 values were taken from levesque et al .",
    "( 2005 ) or calculated from @xmath19 .",
    "we plot the resulting pulsation constants @xmath33 and @xmath26 as function of period in fig.[modelq ] .",
    "in addition to the empirical values , we also show fundamental- and first overtone - mode models of guo & li ( 2002 ) . based on this diagram",
    "we draw several conclusions .",
    "firstly , looking at the model calculations , @xmath26 of the fundamental mode is indeed a better constant than @xmath33 , in accordance with the theoretical expectations , while the first overtone - mode models show an opposite behaviour .",
    "secondly , all periods less than 1000 d agree with fundamental pulsation for both @xmath33 and @xmath26 ( except for rt  car ) .",
    "thirdly , there is a remarkable feature of the pulsation constants : the mean value of @xmath33 for the shorter periods and the mean value of @xmath26 for the long periods are practically equal : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "although this might be coincidence , it may suggest that the fundamental period and the long secondary period are intimately connected via the relation @xmath36 , which could be used as test for future models of the lsps .",
    "one application of the two pulsation constants could be checking the consistency of a given set of physical parameters for a star with the observed periodicity .",
    "a notoriously ambiguous case is vy  cma , for which vastly different radius estimates can be found in the literature , ranging from 600 @xmath37 up to 2,800 r@xmath1 ( massey , levesque & plez 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "for example , monnier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) adopted @xmath38 m@xmath1 and @xmath39 r@xmath1 , while massey , levesque & plez ( 2006 ) , using the new temperature scale of levesque et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , arrived to @xmath40 m@xmath1 and @xmath41 r@xmath1 .",
    "using the mean cycle length of 1,600 d , the high - mass / large radius parameter set results in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , both being consistent with fundamental mode pulsation . for the low - mass / small radius set , the two constants are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which could be acceptable if the 1600 d period referred to a long secondary period . at this stage , unfortunately , the periodicity does not help solve the problem , but since no other rsg has a fundamental - mode period greater than 1000 d , we have a slight preference for the low - mass / small radius set and the lsp interpretation of the 1,600 d periodicity .",
    "the aavso observations span many decades and sometimes almost a century , thus we are now in a better position to understand the _ irregularity _ of rsg variability than previous researchers .",
    "not much effort was put into this direction in the past : irregularity was taken as a general description of non - periodic brightness fluctuation in red giants and supergiants . for semiregular red giants",
    "the nature of irregularities was addressed by lebzelter , kiss & hinkle ( 2000 ) , who compared simultaneous light and velocity variations in a sample of late - type semiregular variables ( of the gcvs types sra and srb ) and concluded that the observed variability is most likely a combination of pulsations and additional irregularity introduced by , e.g. , large convective cells .",
    "the latter phenomenon is theoretically expected ( schwarzschild 1975 , antia et al .",
    "1984 ) , although not much is known on the time - dependent behaviour of the integrated flux variations that arise from the huge convective cells .",
    "percy et al .  ( 2003 ) found growth / decay timescales of 15 years in a sample of small - amplitude pulsating red giant stars , which they interpreted as the natural growth ( or decay ) times for the pulsation modes .",
    "recently , bedding et al .",
    "( 2005 ) discussed the possibility of solar - like excitation of the semiregular variable l@xmath46  pup .",
    "in that star the the power distribution closely resembles that of a stochastically excited damped oscillator and is strikingly similar to close - up views of individual peaks in the power spectrum of solar oscillations : there is a single mode in the spectrum which is resolved into multiple peaks under a well - defined lorentzian envelope .",
    "the envelope s width gives the damping time ( or mode lifetime ) , which is one of the main characteristics of a damped oscillator .",
    "bedding et al.(2005 ) argued that the close similarity may imply solar - like excitation of oscillations , presumably driven by convection .",
    "another interpretation could be that the cavity of oscillations is changing stochastically due to the convective motions , which affects the regularity of the pulsations .",
    "we find the very same structures in the power spectra of several rsgs : a well - defined lorentzian envelope under which the power is split into a series of narrow peaks .",
    "probably the best example is w  per ( fig .",
    "[ pds2 ] ) , where the window function is practically free of any kind of alias structure , so that no false structure due to poor sampling arises in the power spectrum .",
    "other convincing examples include @xmath2  ori , tv  gem , s  per , ah  sco , vy  cma and @xmath2  her , whereas in a few stars the power is so spread over a large range of frequencies that no regular envelope can be traced in the spectrum .    adopting the same approach as bedding et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , i.e. assuming a stochastically excited damped oscillator , we have fitted lorentzian profiles to the power spectra assuming @xmath47 statistics with two degrees of freedom .",
    "this is based on a maximum - likelihood fit , assuming an exponential distribution of the noise ( anderson , duvall & jefferies 1990 , toutain & frhlich 1992 ) .",
    "the fit gives the centroid frequency and the half - width at half power @xmath48 , which can be converted to mode lifetime via @xmath49 .",
    "we show the clearest examples of the lorentzian fits in fig .",
    "[ lorentz ] . we have looked for correlations between mode lifetime , luminosity and length of the long secondary periods . generally , the mode lifetime is typically 34 times the pulsation cycle , with notable exceptions of tv  gem ( less than 1 ) and @xmath2  her ( about 8) .",
    "there might be a slight correlation between the long secondary period and the mode lifetime , but the small number of multiperiodic stars with well - defined lorentzian fits prevented a firm conclusion .",
    "we also investigated the nature of irregularities through the shape of the noise level in the power spectra .",
    "the analysis of fluctuation power spectra density is a common tool in studies of unpredictable and seemingly aperiodic variability , i.e. noise that arises from a stochastic process . in this context , the noise is intrinsic to the source and not a result of measurement errors ( such as poisson noise ) . in astrophysics ,",
    "x - ray light curves of active galaxies and interacting binaries have been a major inspiration of such studies ( e.g. vaughan et al .",

    "of particular interest are noise series whose power spectra are inverse power functions of frequency , the so - called @xmath50 noises , for which examples have been found in a wide range of natural phenomena ( press 1978 ) .",
    "bak , tang & wiesenfeld ( 1987 ) showed that dynamical systems with spatial degrees of freedom naturally evolve into a self - organized point . @xmath0 noise in these systems simply reflects the dynamics of a self - organized critical state of minimally stable clusters of all length scales , which in turn generates fluctuations on all time scales . specifically , turbulence is a phenomenon , for which self - similar scaling is believed to occur both in time and space .",
    "therefore , combining the bak , tang & wiesenfeld ( 1987 ) theory with the schwarzschild ( 1975 ) mechanism of producing irregular variability via large convective cells , one expects a strong @xmath0 noise component in the power spectra of rsg brightness fluctuatios , similarly to solar granulation background ( e.g. rabello - soares et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "that is exactly what we find for the vast majority of the sample . in fig .",
    "[ 1perf ] we plot smoothed power density spectra in log - log representation .",
    "these were calculated from the initial spectra after transforming to the log - log scale and then binning them with a stepsize of 0.1 dex .",
    "besides 17 rsgs , we also show the averaged power density spectrum of the aavso observations of the classical cepheid variable x  cygni , which varies between @xmath51 mag with a period of 16.38 d. this star , being a strictly regular pulsating variable , served as a test object for the power distribution of visual observational errors . as indicated by the lower right panel of fig.[1perf ] ,",
    "the power distribution is much flatter for almost three orders of magnitude , with only a slight rise towards the lowest frequencies .",
    "this is likely to arise from the fact that not many aavso observers are active for more than 10,000 days , so there is a fluctuation of observers on time - scales of longer than a few 1000 days .",
    "it is also apparent that the mean power in x  cyg is much lower than in any of the rsgs , scattering between log  pd = 01 .",
    "its brightness range is roughly in the middle of the sample ( see table  [ sample ] ) , the time - span is about 20,000 days , so that the mean noise level should be representative of the typical aavso light curve in our set .",
    "the rsg spectra look remarkably similar to each other .",
    "there is a roughly linear power increase towards the low - frequency end , which has very similar slope in almost all cases .",
    "generally , we do not detect any flattening at the lowest frequencies , except for @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the time - span of the data ) , which suggests that the observations are too short to extend over the whole range of time - scales of fluctuations that is present in these stars ( with @xmath2  her being an exception ) .",
    "formal linear fits of the spectra resulted in slopes ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 , but none was significantly different of 1 .",
    "furthermore , distinct features in the spectra ( like the peaks of the periods ) made it difficult to fit the overall slope of the `` noise continuum '' accurately , and because of that we fixed the slopes at 1 and fitted the zero - points only , excluding the frequency ranges of the higher power concentrations . the results are indicated by the thick black lines in fig.[1perf ] .    based on the close similarity of the log - log power spectra",
    "we conclude that there is a universal frequency scaling behaviour in the brightness fluctuations of red supergiant stars that fits very well the expectations for background noise from convection .",
    "it is not surprising that period determination is so difficult for these variables : the longer we observe , the more power will be detected in the low - frequency range , suggesting the presence of more and more `` periods '' that are comparable to the full length of the data .",
    "periods identified with the fundamental mode are definitely real  although strongly affected by the high - noise in the systems .",
    "we think most of the long - secondary periods are also real , because we see a consistent picture in many different stars .",
    "however , random peaks at the lowest frequencies naturally develop due to the strong @xmath0 noise signal and it would be misleading to interpret each peaks as periods .",
    "particularly good examples are ad  per and w  cep , of which the latter has variations up to 2 mags in visual but the power follows a well - defined @xmath50 distribution ( with a slope that may be a bit larger than 1 ) .",
    "the whole set of phenomena is strikingly similar to what is observed in the sun and other solar - like oscillators .",
    "the photometric granulation noise in a main - sequence solar - like oscillator has a time - scale of minutes and micromagnitude amplitudes . at the other end of the spectrum we see these pulsating red supergiants with time - scales of years and noise amplitudes reaching tenths of a magnitude",
    "; the underlying physical mechanisms seem to be the same all across the hertzsprung  russell - diagram .    finally , there is interesting correlation between the zeropoints of the fitted lines and the light curve amplitudes .",
    "the two highest amplitude stars , s  per and vx  sgr , have the highest noise levels , reaching one to two orders of magnitudes higher at @xmath54 than any other variable .",
    "this shows they are fundamentally more dynamic in pulsation and noise generation , which reminds us the predicted `` superwind '' phase of rsgs just preceding the supernova explosion .",
    "pulsation model calculations by heger et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that very large pulsation periods , amplitudes and mass - loss rates may be expected to occur at and beyond central helium exhaustion over the time - scale of the last few 10@xmath55 years .",
    "the physical reason for this is the resonant character of pulsations when the pulsation period and the kelvin - helmholtz time - scale of the pulsating envelope evolve into the same order of magnitude .",
    "a similar result was found by bono & panagia ( 2000 ) , whose pulsation models showed larger amplitude and more irregular variations for lower values of t@xmath56 , which turned out to be the main governer of the pulsational behaviour .",
    "as lekht et al .",
    "( 2005 ) noted for s  per , overall dimming of the star after a period of stronger oscillations may be due to subsequent enhanced mass - loss and ejection of a dust shell that screens the stellar radiation .",
    "this is clearly seen for s  per and vx  sgr , and maybe in ah  sco and vy  cma , giving supporting evidence for variations of the pulsation driven mass - loss on a time - scale of @xmath5720 years .",
    "red supergiants as variable stars have long been known for their semiregular brightness fluctuations . using the extremely valuable database of visual observations of the aavso",
    ", we were able to study the main characteristics of their regular and irregular variations . from a detailed analysis of power spectra and time - frequency distributions , this paper discussed the properties of pulsations and their physical implications .",
    "the sample contains several types of light variations . a few stars ( s  per , vx  sgr , ah  sco ) have very large peak - to - peak amplitudes that may reach up to 4 magnitudes in the visual .",
    "these objects show both the most coherent periodic signals and the highest level of @xmath0 noise in the power spectrum , which might be a sign of a `` superwind '' phase of rsgs that precedes the supernova explosion .",
    "we argue that multiple periods found by other studies were sometimes artifacts caused by the extreme noise levels of the systems .",
    "a more common type of variability is characterized by two distinct periods , one of a few hundred days and one of a few thousand days .",
    "the archetypes of these stars are @xmath2  ori and tv  gem , both having a period around 400 days and another around 2000 days .",
    "the shorter periods can be identified with the radial fundamental or low - order overtone modes of pulsation , while the longer one is very similar to the long secondary periods of agb stars , whose origin is not known yet , but could be due to binarity , magnetic activity or non - radial @xmath58-modes ( wood et al .",
    "2004 ) . besides fundamental pulsation",
    ", we also see evidence for first and possibly second overtone modes . finally , in a few stars we can not infer any periodicity at all ( e.g. w  cep , ad  per ) and these are the truly irregular variables dominated by the @xmath0 noise in the power spectrum .",
    "the period jitter of the pulsation modes produces in the power spectrum a well - defined lorentzian envelope .",
    "interpreting this as evidence for stochastically excited and damped oscillations , we measured the mode - lifetime ( or damping rate ) in red supergiants for the first time . in most stars it is several times longer than the period of pulsations .",
    "since the damping rate depends on the stellar structure and convection properties in a complex way , with many weakly constrained theoretical parameters ( e.g. balmforth 1992 ) and , moreover , currently there are no theoretical calculations directly applicable to red supergiants , it is impossible to qualify the agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "however , the strong @xmath0 noise component that seems to be ubiquitous in the whole sample , strongly favours the schwarzschild ( 1975 ) mechanism of producing random brightness variations with huge convection cells , analogous to the granulation background seen in the sun .",
    "finally , stochastic oscillations discussed in this paper may offer an explanation for the seemingly random behaviour of less luminous red giants stars .",
    "for example , random cycle - to - cycle fluctuations of the periods of mira stars ( e.g. eddington & plakidis 1929 , percy & colivas 1999 ) are likely to be analogous to the period jitter we found here",
    ". it would be helpful to have theoretical models that are specifically designed for these phenomena , because the extensive records of homogeneous visual observations allow us measuring noise properties of red giant and supergiant stars quite accurately . in principle ,",
    "internal physics could be probed through these accurate measurements provided that realistic models are calculated .",
    "this work has been supported by a university of sydney postdoctoral research fellowship , the australian research council , the hungarian otka grant # t042509 and the magyary zoltn public foundation for higher education .",
