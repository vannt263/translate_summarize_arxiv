    "modelling strongly correlated electronic systems , such as materials and molecules containing transition metals , remains a challenge for quantum chemists and condensed matter physicists .",
    "the difficulty lies in the proper description of both strong ( static ) and weak ( dynamical ) correlation effects .",
    "strong correlation prevents from using a mean - field approximation as starting point for the description of the dynamical correlation . while , in computational chemistry , multi - reference perturbation and coupled - cluster theories ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) became the state of the art , various methods have also been developed in condensed matter physics .",
    "let us mention , among others , quantum and variational monte carlo  @xcite , the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite , the symmetry breaking and restoration methods  @xcite and methods based on the gutzwiller variational approach  @xcite . considering",
    "that electron correlation is local  @xcite , alternative approaches such as the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite decompose the whole system into a small subsystem called impurity , which is embedded in the rest of the system referred to as the bath .",
    "the impurity and the bath interact with each other in some approximate but self - consistent way .",
    "dmft as well as the recently proposed self - energy embedding theory ( seet )  @xcite are formulated in terms of the ( frequency - dependent ) one - particle green s function . in the latter case",
    ", the self - energy for the strongly correlated orbitals ( corresponding to the local correlation effects ) is obtained from an exact diagonalisation , which is equivalent to full configuration interaction ( fci ) , and the remaining part of the correlation ( called non - local correlation ) is modelled with a self - consistent second - order green s function method ( gf2 )  @xcite .",
    "+ chan and coworkers  @xcite recently introduced a density - matrix embedding theory ( dmet ) which builds an embedded impurity model from the ( frequency - independent ) one - particle density matrix .",
    "such an approach enables the computation of ground - state properties at a much lower computational cost .",
    "bulik  @xcite proposed a simplified version of dmet , referred to as density embedding theory ( det ) , which uses the diagonal elements of the density matrix only . in dmet",
    ", the quantum impurity solver can be the fci method , and the bath is treated in a mean - field approximation such as hartree ",
    "fock ( this is called fci - in - hf embedding in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to overcome such limitations ,",
    "tsuchimochi  @xcite proposed to use an antisymmetrized geminal power ( agp )  @xcite wave function for the bath .",
    "+ in this paper , we explore an alternative frequency - independent embedding scheme , called site - occupation embedding theory ( soet ) , which has been introduced recently by one of the authors  @xcite .",
    "soet is a density - functional theory ( dft)-based method .",
    "more precisely , it relies on the extension of dft to model hamiltonians  @xcite , which is often referred to as site - occupation functional theory ( soft ) .",
    "the difference between conventional soft and soet lies in the choice of the fictitious system from which the site occupations are obtained .",
    "in soet , a partially - interacting system consisting of an interacting impurity site and non - interacting bath sites is considered , rather than a completely non - interacting system .",
    "the embedding of the impurity system is in principle exact and obtained from a site - occupation correlation functional for the bath .",
    "note that , in the standard ( frequency - independent ) dft+u method  @xcite , an explicit hubbard - type two - electron repulsion @xmath0 parameter is introduced in the spirit of hybrid functionals ( i.e. in a single - determinantal framework ) .",
    "in contrast to dft+u , soet aims at treating explicitly ( with a multideterminantal wavefunction or , alternatively , with green s functions ) some part of the correlation energy , namely the correlation energy of the impurity site .",
    "one of the motivation for developing such an approach is the calculation of local properties such as double occupations . it can be shown ( this will be presented in a separate work ) that the physical double occupation can be expressed exactly in terms of the embedded impurity double occupation and the derivative of a complementary site - occupation - functional correlation energy with respect to @xmath0 . as a result",
    ", only one single impurity site is needed to improve the calculation of local properties .   +   as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , soet can in principle be extended to quantum chemical hamiltonians .",
    "the purpose of such an extension would be the formulation of a rigorous double - counting - free multiconfiguration dft in the orbital space .",
    "a formal analogy can actually be made between soet and the more standard multideterminantal extension of dft based on range separation  @xcite . while , in the latter case , the basic variable is the electron density ( in real space ) and the separation of correlation effects is based on the range of these effects , soet would rely , in quantum chemistry , on the orbital occupations .",
    "correlation effects would then be separated in the orbital space , like in conventional multiconfigurational methods , thus leading to a multiconfigurational dft - type method .",
    "the so - called active orbitals would then play the role of `` impurity sites '' .",
    "work on the orbital dependence  @xcite of such a scheme is currently in progress . in summary ,",
    "the long - range interaction in range - separated dft is the analog of the impurity on - site repulsion in soet for the hubbard model or the analog of the two - electron repulsion in the active space for quantum chemistry .",
    "+    so far , soet has been explored at the formal level only  @xcite .",
    "in particular , no explicit site - occupation approximate functional was derived . in this work ,",
    "we propose a simple local density approximation ( lda ) based on the hubbard dimer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a brief introduction to soft ( section  [ subsec : soft ] ) and soet ( section  [ subsec : soet ] ) , the application of soet to the two - electron hubbard dimer is discussed in details in section  [ subsec : hubbard_dimer ] .",
    "an impurity - occupation functional approximation based on the hubbard dimer is then introduced in section  [ subsec : ilda ] .",
    "after the computational details ( section  [ sec : comp_det ] ) , exact and approximate results obtained for uniform 8-site hubbard rings are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "+ in order to describe both static and dynamical correlations simultaneously , one wants to formulate a rigorous multi - configurational dft .",
    "an intuitive way to proceed is to merge dft with casscf , leading to the so - called casdft approach  @xcite .",

    "the electronic correlation in the complete active space ( cas ) is treated by casscf but also , in principle , by the correlation density functional .",
    "this is known as the double counting problem .",
    "one should develop new functionals which vary with the cas so that correlation effects are transferred from casscf to the dft part when varying the size of the cas . but deriving cas - dependent density functionals is a complicated task , because the cas is defined in the orbital space whereas the electronic density is defined in the coordinate space .",
    "savin  @xcite proposed a range - separated dft approach which separates the correlation effects in the coordinate space , thus combining long - range wft with short - range dft .",
    "although such an approach allows for a rigorous multiconfigurational description of the electron density , static correlation is not a purely long - range effect . as an alternative ,",
    "e.fromager  @xcite proposed to separate correlation effects in the orbital space , like in a regular casscf calculation , and to use orbitals occupation as a new variable instead of the electronic density for modeling dynamical correlation through a functional .",
    "using such a dft formulation leads to an exact casdft method formulated in the orbital space only .",
    "a similar approach has been proposed earlier by savin  @xcite but the electronic density was still used eventhough the correlation effects were separated in the orbital space . +      in order to avoid the double counting problem , it is convenient to work in the orbital space rather than in the coordinate space .",
    "this reformulation leads to a change of variable in dft .",
    "indeed , the electronic density @xmath3 is defined in the coordinate space , and is therefore not adequate for a dft in the orbital space .",
    "a new basic variable in dft is needed , and the orbital - occupation seems to be the variable of choice .",
    "this is known as _ site - occupation functional theory _ ( soft ) in condensed matter physics @xcite , which is formulated for model hamiltonians with the site - occupation as variable .",
    "let us stress that from a quantum chemical point of view , site - occupation corresponds to orbital - occupation .",
    "let us consider the second - quantized expression for the hubbard model hamiltonian with an external potential @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hopping integral , @xmath7 is the on - site two - electron repulsion parameter , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the site - occupation operator equals @xmath10 and , for a given wave function @xmath11 , the occupation of site @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 .",
    "the hohenberg  kohn ( hk ) theorem can be adapted to the hamiltonian in equation  ( [ eq : hubb_hamil_ext_pot ] ) , i.e. there is a one - to - one correspondence between the external potential @xmath14 , up to a constant , and the ground - state site occupations @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "consequently , for a given potential @xmath14 , the exact ground - state energy @xmath16 can be obtained from the following variational principle , @xmath17 where @xmath18 . in this approach , which is referred to as the site - occupation functional theory ( soft ) in the following ,",
    "the analog of the universal hk functional is a @xmath19- and @xmath0-dependent functional of the site occupations that can be written within the levy ",
    "lieb ( ll ) constrained - search formalism as @xmath20 note that the site occupations are a collection of occupation numbers whereas the electron density , which is the basic variable in conventional dft , is a continuous function of space coordinates .",
    "strictly speaking , one should refer to @xmath21 as a ll function rather than functional .",
    "nevertheless , `` functional '' is often used in the literature  @xcite , thus emphasizing on the formal analogies between soft and dft .",
    "we will do the same in the rest of this paper .",
    "note that the ll functional can be rewritten as a legendre  fenchel transform  @xcite : @xmath22 the maximising potential provides the ground - state wave function with site occupations @xmath23 . as shown in sec .",

    "it has been proven that the site occupations ( diagonal elements of the density matrix ) are non - interacting @xmath35representable @xcite which is not the case if the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are considered @xcite , thus ensuring the good choice of the site occupations as variable .",
    "we keep it for another time , it is very interesting but we have no time to really look at it , and the @xmath35-rep problem will interest us for another paper . for example , in dmet where the density matrix is used , it is not non - interacting @xmath35-representable but is it partially - interacting @xmath35-rep ? ? ?",

    "let us stress that soet is in principle exact and that the ground - state energy should not depend on the number of impurity sites if exact complementary functionals are used  @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , even for the large @xmath198 value , such a potential provides a good starting point for better approximations . in this respect , ilda is also relevant in the strongly correlated regime .",
    "note that the impurity - optimised potential is the best potential one can get within ilda since it reproduces the impurity occupation exactly .",
    "this section deals with the performance of the 2l - ilda . converged site occupations are shown in figure  [ fig : ilda_site_occ ] .",
    "2l - ilda is exact at half - filling ( @xmath201 ) , as expected . indeed , in this case , the potential is uniform in the bath and equal to its mean - field approximation .",

    "comparison is made with the impurity - optimised potential results in figure  [ fig : site - occ - comparison ] for @xmath202 electrons .",
    "2l - ilda does not reproduce the correct impurity occupation whereas , by construction , the impurity - optimised potential scheme does .",
    "this was somehow expected since the site - occupation - functional embedding potential used in the 2l - ilda is parametrised for the hubbard dimer . in the latter case ,",

    "then the slope decreases significantly for @xmath207 . in the strongly correlated regime ( @xmath208 )",

    "+    let us now focus on the 2l - ilda embedding potential .",
    "comparison is made with the exact and impurity - optimised potentials in figure  [ fig : discontinuity ] .",
    "a nice feature of 2l - ilda is that the step that leads to a discontinuity at half - filling in the @xmath132 limit is relatively well reproduced . in the weakly correlated regime ( @xmath209 ) ,",
    "self - consistency does not affect the potential significantly which is relatively close to the exact one .",
    "this statement does not hold for @xmath197 .",
    "this can be related to the deviation from uniformity discussed previously . +    turning to the impurity correlation energy",
    "( see figure  [ fig : ecimp_it0_converged ] ) , comparison with the exact and 2l - ilda ( iteration 0 ) results shows that the error is , like in many conventional dft calculations  @xcite , essentially driven by the approximate functional when @xmath0 is small .",
    "this was expected since the impurity correlation functional used in 2l - ilda is parametrised for the hubbard dimer where the bath reduces to a single site with occupation @xmath203 rather than a collection of sites which all have the same occupation @xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the correlation is strong ( @xmath210 and @xmath211 ) , the error is site - occupation - driven .",
    "indeed , at iteration 0 , the impurity occupation is exact and the 2l - ilda impurity correlation energy is close to the exact one .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that , in the strongly correlated limit , interactions become essentially local .",
    "as mentioned previously , self - consistency deteriorates the impurity occupation , thus leading to a substantial error in the correlation energy .",
    "the extension of dft to model hamiltonians such as the hubbard hamiltonian , as well as the formulation of an exact site - occupation embedding theory ( soet ) , which was recently proposed by one of the authors  @xcite , have been briefly reviewed .",
    "a simple local site - occupation approximation , referred to as 2l - ilda , has then been proposed in order to perform practical soet calculations .",
    "it relies on two approximations : ( i ) the correlation energy of the embedded impurity system is assumed to depend on the occupation of the impurity site only and , within such an approximation , ( ii ) the embedded impurity correlation functional of the ( two - level ) hubbard dimer is employed . as a proof of concept , the theory has been tested on a uniform 8-site hubbard ring .",
    "exact and 2l - ilda calculations have been performed . in the latter case , the parametrisation of carrascal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has been used .",
    "promising results were obtained at the 2l - ilda level , even though the approximation is quite simple . in the weakly correlated regime ,",

    "results might be improved by developing a functional that depends explicitly on the impurity nearest neighbours occupations , in the spirit of the generalised gradient approximation in dft .",
    "the anderson model  @xcite might be used for developing more accurate ilda schemes . in order to turn soet into a useful computational method",
    ", one should obviously compute double occupancies , through the evaluation of energy derivatives with respect to the on - site repulsion parameter @xmath0 , and perform calculations on larger rings , for example , by combining dmrg  @xcite with soet .",
