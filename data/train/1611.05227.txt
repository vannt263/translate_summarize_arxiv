    "type iii solar radio bursts are the signatures of accelerated electrons streaming outward through the corona and the interplanetary medium in the aftermath of flares and weak chromospheric brightenings . the electrons stream at speeds @xmath6 along the open field magnetic field lines .",
    "the radio emission is widely accepted to be because of the following two - step process : ( 1 ) the excitation of high levels of plasma oscillations ( langmuir waves ) by the propagating electron streams / beams and ( 2 ) subsequent conversion of these langmuir waves into electromagnetic waves at the fundamental ( f ) and second harmonic ( h ) of the local plasma frequency . the h emission results from the coalescence of two langmuir waves .",
    "the type iii bursts are best identified on the dynamic spectra obtained using radio spectrographs .",
    "they appear as intense emission , drifting from high to low frequencies at @xmath0 100 mhz / s .",
    "the above frequency drift results from the decrease of electron density and hence the plasma frequency , with distance in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the bursts occur over the frequency range from @xmath0 1 ghz-10 khz , corresponding to a distance range extending from the low corona to beyond the orbit of the earth .",
    "the bursts occur either isolated or in groups . while the former has a life - time of about few seconds at any given frequency , the groups of bursts last for @xmath0 5 m @xcite",
    ". groups of type iii bursts are generally associated with flares observed in x - rays and/or h@xmath7 .",
    "they are a classic signature of the impulsive phase of flares in which the radiation is primarily non - thermal .",
    "it is believed that each individual burst is due to radiation associated with electron streams moving outwards through the corona along large scale diverging magnetic field lines connected to a common acceleration / injection site @xcite .",
    "the occurence of non - thermal bursts is a clear indication of particle acceleration during an event .",
    "note that the generation of radio emission by non - thermal electron beams is very efficient due to the coherent nature of the emission mechanism .",
    "most of the type iii bursts are weakly , circularly polarized with @xmath8 0.15 .",
    "however , some bursts , those identified as due to fundamental plasma emission , have @xmath9 0.5 @xcite .",
    "harmonic emission is observed mainly at low frequencies .",
    "note that the presence of the background magnetic field at the source region of type iii radio bursts can give rise to a net @xmath1 in the ordinary ( ` o ' ) mode for the escaping radiation @xcite .",
    "the polarization observations of the h component of type iii radio bursts are considered to be a better diagnostic tool to estimate the solar coronal magnetic field since the polarization of the f component is affected by propagation effects @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report observations of quasi - periodic , harmonic type iii bursts @xcite and estimate the coronal magnetic field using the empirical relationship between the magnetic field and the @xmath1 for the harmonic plasma emission @xcite .",
    "we verified the results by independantly estimating the magnetic field from the periodicity of the observed type iii radio bursts .",
    "interestingly both the methods give consistent results indicating the usefulness of ground based low frequency radio observations to estimate the coronal magnetic field , particularly over the range @xmath10 , where measurements at other wavelength bands in the electromagnetic spectrum are presently difficult .",
    "the radio data reported in the present work were obtained at 80 mhz on 2012 september 20 , 2013 january 18 , and 2013 march 11 with the heliograph @xcite , the polarimeter @xcite , and the spectrograph @xcite at the gauribidanur observatory , about 100 km north of bangalore in india @xcite . the co - ordinates of the array are longitude = @xmath11 east , and latitude = @xmath12 north .",
    "the heliograph ( gauribidanur radioheliograph , graph ) is a t - shaped radio interferometer array which produces two dimensional images of the solar corona with an angular resolution of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) at the above frequency .",
    "the integration time is @xmath0 250 ms and the observing bandwidth is @xmath0 2 mhz .",
    "the polarimeter ( gauribidanur radio interference polarimeter , grip ) is an east - west one - dimensional array operating in the interferometer mode and it responds to the integrated and polarized flux densities from the ` whole ' sun .",
    "the half - power width of the response function ( ` beam ' ) of the grip is broad ( compared to the sun ) in both right ascension / east - west direction ( @xmath15 at 80 mhz ) and declination / north - south direction ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this implies that a plot of the grip data ( i.e. the time profile ) for observations in the transit mode is essentially the ` east - west beam ' of the array with an amplitude proportional to the strength of the emission from the ` whole ' sun at the observing frequency , weighted by the antenna gain in that direction .",
    "the integration time is @xmath0 250 ms and the observing bandwidth is @xmath0 2 mhz .",
    "the radio source(s ) responsible for the circularly polarized emission observed with the grip are identified using the two - dimensional radioheliograms obtained with the graph around the same time .",
    "note that linear polarization , if present at the coronal source region , tends to be obliterated at low radio frequencies because of the differential faraday rotation of the plane of polarization within the observing bandwidth @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph antenna system ( gauribidanur low frequency solar spectrograph , gloss ) is a total power instrument and the half - power width of its antenna response of gloss is @xmath17 ( @xmath14 ) at 80 mhz .",
    "the integration time is @xmath0 100 ms and the observing bandwidth is @xmath0 300 khz at each frequency .",
    "the width of the response of gloss in hour angle is nearly independent of frequency .",
    "the sun is a point source for both the grip and the gloss .",
    "all the above three instruments observe the sun everyday during the interval 4 - 9 ut .",
    "the minimum detectable flux density of the graph , grip and gloss are @xmath0 20 jy , 200 jy , 3000 jy , respectively ( 1 jy = @xmath18 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1 ] shows the temporal evolution of the stokes i & v radio emission from the solar corona at 80 mhz as observed with the grip on 2012 december 20 during the interval 06:36 - 06:39 ut , i.e. around the transit of the sun over gauribidanur .",
    "one can notice the presence of intense quasi - periodic emission in both the stokes i and v time profiles .",
    "these are the characteristic signature of groups of type iii solar radio bursts from the sun @xcite .",
    "we verified the same from the dynamic spectra ( 85 - 35 mhz ) obtained with gloss during the above interval ( figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) .",
    "the peak stokes i and v flux densities in figure [ fig : figure1 ] are @xmath19 jy and @xmath20 jy , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath1 = @xmath21 is @xmath0 0.11 .",
    "note the average flux density of the type iii solar radio bursts reported in the literature is typically @xmath22 jy @xcite .",
    "this is about two orders of magnitude higher than the peak flux density of the type iii burst of 2012 december 20 , indicating that the latter is a weak event .",
    "the estimated average periodicity of the radio emission in figure [ fig : figure1 ] is @xmath0 4.5 sec , in both stokes i & v. the source region of the bursts was identified from the radioheliogram obtained with the graph around the same time ( figures [ fig : figure3 ] and [ fig : figure4 ] ) .",
    "one can notice the bursts orginated close to the solar limb .",
    "they were associated with a sf class h@xmath7 flare from ar 11574 located at s25w69 . a shift in the solar radio source position due to ionospheric effects",
    "is expected to be @xmath23 at 80 mhz in the hour angle range @xmath24 2 hr @xcite .",
    "the present observations were carried out close to the transit of the sun over the local meridian at gauribidanur .",
    "similarly , the effects of scattering ( irregular refraction due to density inhomogeneities in the solar corona ) on the observed source position are also considered to be small at 80 mhz compared to lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "the positional shift of discrete solar radio sources due to scattering is expected to be @xmath25 at 80 mhz @xcite .",
    "ray tracing calculations employing realistic coronal electron density models and density fluctuations show that the turning points of the rays that undergo irregular refraction almost coincide with the location of the plasma ( ` critical ' ) layer in the non - scattering case even at 73.8 mhz @xcite .",
    "obviously , the situation should be better at 80 mhz .",
    "also there is no unambiguous evidence that scattering is important in any of the solar radio bursts @xcite .",
    "note that high angular resolution observations of the solar corona indicate that discrete radio sources of angular size @xmath26 are present in the solar atmosphere from where low frequency radio radiation originates @xcite .",
    "the projection effects are also expected to be minimal since we have used only the limb events for the present work ( see for eg .",
    "figure [ fig : figure4 ] ) .",
    "the details related to the type iii radio burst 2012 december 20 described above and the other two events ( 2013 january 18 and 2013 march 11 ) are listed in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "@xcite pointed out that both the fundamental ( f ) and the harmonic ( h ) type iii solar radio burst emission should generally be observable only for events near the center of the solar disk .",
    "elsewhere it should be purely harmonic emission .",
    "this is because the f emission is more directive compared to the h emission . according to @xcite , the ground based observations of type iii radio bursts associated with sunspot regions located @xmath27 either to the east or west of the central meridian on the sun , are primarily h emission .",
    "the f component has a limiting directivity of @xmath28 ( from the central meridian on the sun ) at 80 mhz @xcite .",
    "a similar result was recently reported by @xcite for the very low frequency solar type iii radio bursts observed in the interplanetary medium .",
    "note the heliographic longitude of the sunspot regions associated with the type iii radio bursts in the present case are all @xmath27 ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath1 for all the three events in the present case are close to the average @xmath1 ( @xmath29 ) reported for the circularly polarized h component of the type iii bursts ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) . for the f component , the reported average @xmath1 @xmath0 0.35 @xcite .",
    "the above arguments on the directivity and the @xmath1 indicate that the type iii bursts observed in the present case are due to h emission . under such circumstances the magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) near the source region of the bursts",
    "can be calculated using the following relationship @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the plasma frequency in mhz and @xmath3 is in gauss .",
    "@xmath32 is a slowly varying function which depends on the viewing angle @xmath33 between the magnetic field component and the line - of - sight , and the angular distribution @xmath34 of the langmuir waves . in the present case , @xmath35 ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "we assumed @xmath31 = 40 mhz since the observed emission at 80 mhz is most likely the h component .",
    "the langmuir waves are considered to be confined to a small range of angles , i.e. a cone of opening angle @xmath36 , to the magnetic field direction for harmonic type iii emission in the ` o ' mode @xcite . assuming the average value , i.e. @xmath37 , we find that @xmath38 in the aforementioned range of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the estimated magnetic field values using equation ( 1 ) for the type iii events reported in the present work are listed in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : figure5 ] shows the @xmath3 values corresponding to the individual bursts in the quasi - periodic type iii burst emission observed on 20 september 2012 ( figure [ fig : figure1 ] ) .",
    "they remain approximately constant , within the error limits .",
    "we found that the @xmath3 values corresponding to the bursts observed on 2013 january 18 and 2013 march 11 also exhibit a similar trend .",
    "the term quasi - periodicity or pulsations in solar radio physics refers to the quasi - periodic amplitude variations in the time profile of the observed radio flux at any particular observing frequency .",
    "the associated physical mechanisms have been classified into three categories as on date : ( 1 ) modulation of the emission by coronal loop oscillations , ( 2 ) intrinsic oscillations of the emission created by oscillatory wave - wave interactions and wave - particle interactions , and ( 3 ) modulation of electron acceleration / injection process responsible for the emission @xcite . out of this , category ( 2 ) can be ruled out in the present case since they apply primarily to fundamental ` o ' mode and harmonic extra - ordinary mode ( ` e ' mode ) whereas the type iii bursts reported in the present work correspond to harmonic ` o ' mode as mentioned in section 3.1 @xcite . in view of this",
    ", we have carried out the calculations for categories ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) in the reminder of this section .",
    "laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have shown that the release of magnetic energy by reconnection must be considered as a highly time - dependent process ( see for eg .",
    "@xcite ) . according to @xcite , the temporal variations in the radio burst flux are caused by modulations of the particle acceleration in a highly dynamic reconnection process .",
    "a similar model , i.e. quasi - periodic reconnection and particle injection was reported by @xcite also .",
    "the authors had noted that even a very small ( @xmath39 ) quasi - periodic modulation of the magnetic field is sufficient for periodic electron acceleration .",
    "both these models belong to the category ( 3 ) mentioned above and were successful in explaining the associated observations .",
    "the modulation is likely to be communicated on a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) time scale in the acceleration region @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the corresponding alfvn speed ( @xmath40 ) can be estimated as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the period of the quasi - periodic emission in seconds ( s ) and @xmath43 10000 km is the typical dimension of the region over which the type iii radio burst producing electrons are injected @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the individual bursts that are temporally separated in a type iii group are also spatially fragmented within the same acceleration region @xcite . considering category ( 1 ) where the observed quasi - periodicities are caused by the mhd oscillations of the associated coronal loop(s ) , the corresponding relationship for the alfvn speed is @xcite , @xmath44 where @xmath45 3500 km is the width of the coronal loop . according to @xcite , the quasi - periodic emission observed in the upper part of the corona from where the meter - decameter wave radio emission originates , paticularly those due to plasma processes as in the present case , are best described by the above model .",
    "@xcite showed that the quasi - periodic pulsation observed by them in the microwave range are due to the modulation of the acceleration / injection rate of the non thermal electrons by the oscillations in the associated coronal loop(s ) .",
    "once @xmath40 is known in either category ( 1 ) or ( 3 ) , the associated magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) can be calculated from the definition of the former , i.e. : @xmath46 @xmath47 is the electron density in units of @xmath48 and can be estimated using the relationship @xmath49 . note @xmath40 in equation ( 3 ) is in units of km / s .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath3 values estimated using equations ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) for the type iii events reported in the present work are listed in table [ tab : table1 ]",
    ". equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) result in nearly the same values for @xmath40 and @xmath3 .",
    "we have reported estimates of the coronal magnetic field using low frequency ( 80 mhz ) radio observations of quasi - periodic harmonic type iii burst emission associated with sunspot regions close to the solar limb .",
    "the data were obtained with the heliograph , the polarimeter and the spectrograph at the gauribidanur observatory .",
    "though several type iii bursts are observed everyday with the aforementioned suite of instruments , we selected only those events with @xmath50 0.15 and whose associated source region is close to the limb of the sun .",
    "the above are the criteria to identify a harmonic type iii burst as mentioned earlier .",
    "also we limited ourselves to data obtained close to the transit of the sun over the local meridian at gauribidanur in order to minimize errors in the source position due to propagation effects .",
    "we adopted two independant approaches to estimate the magnetic field : ( 1 ) based on the relationship between the @xmath1 and the @xmath3 for harmonic type iii radio burst emission , and ( 2 ) using the quasi - periodicity in the observed type iii radio burst emission .",
    "both the methods give the same result , i.e. the average @xmath51 g. we would like to note here that the often referred empirical relationship for the coronal magnetic field @xcite predicts @xmath4 3 g at 80 mhz .",
    "we had assumed the 80 mhz plasma level to be located at radial distance @xmath5 in the solar atmosphere for the above calculation @xcite .",
    "note @xcite had measured @xmath4 4 g at @xmath52 using zeeman splitting observations of the fe xiii @xmath531075 nm coronal emission line from an active region close to the solar limb . assuming that @xmath54 @xcite , we find that the above measurement indicates @xmath4 3.1 g @xmath55 .",
    "the present estimates are also in reasonable agreement with that of @xcite who had reported @xmath56 g at 77 mhz for radio sources associated with the coronal streamers at @xmath57 .",
    "note the type iii radio bursts are considered to be closely associated with the coronal streamers @xcite .",
    "we would like to add here that the estimated @xmath40 in the present case ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) are consistent with the corresponding values reported by @xcite for the active region solar corona .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the staff of the gauribidanur observatory for their help in observations , maintenance of the antenna and receiver systems there .",
    "we thank the referee for his / her kind suggestions and comments using which we were able to bring out the results more clearly .",
