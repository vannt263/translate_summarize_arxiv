    "one of the goals of modern theoretical physics is to find a consistent quantum description of gravity and the other interactions in nature .",
    "this description should be able to reproduce the phenomenology of the standard particle and cosmological models and predict new , observable effects .",
    "so far , only two candidates seem to fulfil at least part of the necessary requirements of such an ambitious program .",
    "one is string theory : its nonperturbative structure is still under intense scrutiny but some of its contents were already exploited to motivate cosmological scenarios where the visible universe is an extended four - dimensional object ( a brane ) living in a higher - dimensional , continuous spacetime ( see @xcite for some reviews ) .    an alternative , nonperturbative candidate is loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite , where the formulation of the quantum theory is carried out via the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the specialization to isotropic backgrounds , and in particular to a friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) metric , is referred to as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the resulting spacetime is four - dimensional by construction .",
    "the symmetry reduction of the theory is performed at the kinematical level , that is , before solving the hamiltonian constraint @xcite .",
    "this procedure resembles standard minisuperspace quantizations , in the sense that the symplectic structure is reduced at the classical level @xcite .",
    "however , the identification of the canonical variables and their quantization closely follow the formulation of loop quantum gravity",
    ". the states in the resulting hilbert space , constructed in @xcite , are in fact regarded as symmetric states of the full theory .    at very small scales , below a critical scale factor @xmath0",
    ", spacetime is discretized and the hamiltonian constraint equation can be written as an evolution equation with discrete time @xcite . above another critical value @xmath1 , larger than the planck length @xmath2 , classical dynamics",
    "is recovered , while in the intermediate , semiclassical regime @xmath3 spacetime can be treated as a continuum but nonperturbative quantum effects modify the standard cosmological evolution . the evolution equation can then be compared with the standard wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "several authors have studied the semiclassical limit of lqc in the context of early - universe inflation @xcite , or bouncing / cyclic scenarios @xcite .",
    "loop quantum gravity can leave its imprint on the large - scale structure of the universe and , in particular , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "however , the understanding of inflation in this framework is still partial and further study of its testable effects is required .    in this paper",
    ", we compute the main cosmological scalar observables from the perturbed background equations using standard techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) , assuming that inflation takes place only in the semiclassical regime .",
    "the scalar amplitude and spectral index , as well as the index running , are found at lowest order in the slow - roll ( sr ) approximation , that is , on a de sitter ( ds ) background . the scalar spectral index can be blue - tilted and far from the harrison ",
    "zeldovich spectrum @xmath4 .",
    "we consider two examples of background homogeneous exact solutions and find that quasi scale invariance , as required by observations ( see @xcite for wmap experiment ) , is either lost or achieved at the price of a certain amount of tuning of the ambiguities .",
    "while this work was under completion , other authors have considered the issue of scalar perturbations without metric backreaction @xcite .",
    "we will compare their results with ours in due course .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ setup ]",
    "we briefly recall basic concepts and construction of loop quantum cosmology .",
    "several aspects and problems of lqc and the present treatment are listed in section  [ prob ] .",
    "the inflationary scalar spectrum and index are found in section  [ obs ] and calculated for a couple of examples in section  [ sol ] .",
    "the analysis is extended to other quantization schemes in section  [ genqs ] .",
    "section  [ disc ] is devoted to discussion of these results and future prospects .",
    "the basic multiplication operator in homogeneous loop quantum gravity are point holonomies , which are @xmath5-elements associated with a single point on the space manifold and serve to describe quantum scalar fields .",
    "the further requirement of isotropy implies that quantum states ( in the connection representation ) are functions on a single copy of @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , the holonomies can be written as @xmath6 in the spin-@xmath7 fundamental representation , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are pauli matrices , and @xmath11 is a quantization ambiguity related to the length of the holonomy and fixed to a natural value @xcite ( in many papers , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the connection component @xmath13 is conjugate to the density weighted dreibein component @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the curvature constant ( @xmath16 for a flat universe , @xmath17 for a closed one ; the hamiltonian formulation in the open case is treated separately @xcite ) , @xmath18 is the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter , and derivatives with respect to synchronous time are indicated as dots .",

    "the volume and dreibein operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 have zero eigenvalue at the origin of the discretized ` time ' variable @xmath28 , and their inverses fail to be densely defined operators .",
    "however , the inverse - volume operator @xmath29 is regular ( with zero eigenvalue ) at @xmath30 : this way the big bang singularity is healed by purely geometrical effects ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the inverse volume can be written in a convenient way by using the classical identity @xmath31^{3/(2 - 2 l)}$ ] @xcite and replacing the connection components with holonomies ,",
    "a^-3 = ^3/(2 - 2 l ) , which does not involve inverse , classically divergent powers of @xmath32 if @xmath33 .",
    "the _ ambiguity parameter _ @xmath34 determines the initial slope of the effective geometrical density .",
    "a natural choice , often used in literature , is @xmath35 @xcite . to preserve coordinate invariance when quantizing geometrical densities",
    ", @xmath34 must be discrete , @xmath36 , @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "hence one can select the bound @xmath38 , which is also favoured phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "the other ambiguity @xmath39 is a half - integer setting the value of the scale factor at which classical cosmology is recovered .",
    "it arises for arbitrary spin-@xmath39 representations ( in which the above trace is taken ) of the holonomy @xcite .",
    "the fundamental representation corresponds to @xmath40 .",
    "promoting poisson brackets to commutators of operators , one defines an inverse - volume operator .",
    "if the wavefunction of the universe does not oscillate at small scales , difference operators can be approximated by differential operators which also appear in the standard wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation .",
    "the matter hamiltonian , however , is not as in standard quantum cosmology , equation ( [ clasm ] ) , because of the promotion of the inverse volume to an operator @xmath41 with eigenvalues @xmath42 , where d_l q^3/2\\{}^3/(2 - 2l ) ; + [ dl ] here , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . equation ( [ dl ] ) is valid for large @xmath39 and is a good approximation already at @xmath46 .",
    "a large @xmath39 extends the period of superinflation @xcite , although this does not rule out values @xmath47 .",

    "it is straightforward to extend the above equations of motion accordingly .",
    "following the classification of @xcite , we denote with ham@xmath80 , @xmath81 , the scheme where arbitrary positive powers of @xmath82 are inserted into the hamiltonian .",
    "classically these insertions are equal to unity , but upon quantization they become dynamically nontrivial . in particular , in ham@xmath80 both the matter effective energy density in the friedmann equation and the definition of @xmath83 in terms of the momentum @xmath84 are multiplied by @xmath85 : @xmath86 .",
    "the above equations are in the ham@xmath87 scheme .",
    "a second possibility is the fried quantization @xcite , where the squared hubble parameter is promoted to an operator and the hamiltonian is no longer regarded as the primary object .",

    "the effect of the ` secondary ' ambiguities @xmath98 is discussed in section [ genqs ] .",

    "the first parameters of the slow - roll tower are chosen as in the classical case : & & - , + & & - , + ^2 & & ( ) ^. .",
    "the first expression is purely geometrical , does not depend on the effective action , and has the advantage to define inflation precisely when @xmath102 . according to the second formula , the condition @xmath103 is sufficient to neglect @xmath104 with respect to the modified friction term in the klein",

    "the evolution equations of the sr parameters are & = & 2h[dotex ] + & & 2h,[dothe ] + & = & h(-^2 ) .",
    "the extra factor @xmath105 in equation ( [ dothe ] ) will contribute to modify the scalar spectrum .    since we want to extract the cosmological observables at lowest order in the sr parameters ,",
    "it is sufficient to assume a de sitter background ( @xmath106 const ) .",
    "note that in the traditional sr approximation all the observables are written at the same sr order , but for our purposes the ds computation will be enough , even if it does not allow such a systematic truncation ( see section [ vali ] ) .",
    "in particular , on can ignore all derivatives of @xmath107 and @xmath25 in the equations of motion and metric perturbations in the linearly perturbed equations .",
    "before proceeding , we underline several issues characterizing different formulations and approximations of loop quantum cosmology .      in a flat frw background , the scale factor can be rescaled by a conformal transformation which leaves the classical equations of motion invariant .",
    "if the spatial homogeneous slice is noncompact ( @xmath16 ) , all integrations must be performed over a fiducial cell , of size @xmath108 , within that slice . then the fiducial cell also has the above ` gauge ' freedom ( in a closed universe , one can fix the cell to have unit volume ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the characteristic scale @xmath1 is fixed by the theory and the ratio @xmath109 , as well as its functions and the statement that ` the semiclassical regime is such that @xmath110 ' , are not conformally invariant ( @xcite , appendix b.2 ) .",
    "then the theory and its observable implications would depend on the choice of @xmath32 , i.e.  on specific initial conditions , even in the recent ` @xmath111 quantization ' @xcite . as we shall see , although the normalization of the scalar spectrum depends on @xmath1 , the spectral index does not , and contains only the ambiguity @xmath61 .",
    "however , both observables are derived in the semiclassical limit and the gauge dependence is , at best , implicit .",
    "an escape route from the rescaling issue might be to start with a closed universe , for which there is no ambiguity in the scale factor .",
    "if the background is superaccelerating , the classical connection is @xmath112 , since the first term rapidly vanishes",
    ". then the universe loses memory about the initial curvature and one can use the equations in flat frw .",
    "however , one may not be entitled to rely upon this picture too close to the singularity , when the scale factor , although expanding , is still very small ; this might indeed happen in semiclassical lqc inflation .",
    "also , there may be additional complications when perturbations are taken into account .",
    "this point should be addressed in the near future .",
    "the previous hamiltonian constraint equation ( [ quh ] ) , in the spin-@xmath7 representation and in the flat case ( @xmath16 ) , was generalized through a wkb approximation directly at the level of the difference equation @xcite and via a path integral quantization @xcite .",
    "corrections to the classical constraint are generated by the discrete structure of spacetime when smoothing the dynamical difference equations near the planck scale to the continuum limit .",
    "upon quantization of the connection in terms of holonomy operators , the factor @xmath113 in equation ( [ clas ] ) is modified as @xmath114 @xcite and the relation between @xmath115 and @xmath116 becomes @xmath117 .",
    "the effective friedmann equation is then [ rrfe ] h^2 _",
    "eff(1- ) , where @xmath118 is a critical density .",
    "this kind of evolution has applications for bouncing scenarios @xcite .    at the time of completion of this paper",
    ", we assumed that inflation takes place at energies @xmath119 , that is , when @xmath120 ; then the standard friedmann equation ( [ feeff ] ) can be used as in the rest of the discussion .",
    "a problem might have been that recollapse can in principle occur during the inflationary regime @xcite , since @xmath118 can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the scalar field momentum .",
    "however , the above ` @xmath121 quantization ' does not take into account the expansion of the fiducial cell in a frw background .",
    "this was done in the novel @xmath111 quantization described in @xcite , where _ 0 | .",
    "the functional form of the inverse volume eigenvalues turns out to be modified ; the friedmann equation is still equation ( [ rrfe ] ) but with @xmath118 fixed and around 80% of the planck density .",
    "the equation for the scalar is the classical one after neglecting rapidly damped quantum corrections ( @xcite , appendix b ) .",
    "one would get a standard friedmann equation when @xmath122 , that is , roughly when @xmath123 .",
    "this corresponds to the _ classical _ regime , and all quantum corrections are neglected accordingly .",
    "such a picture is qualitatively different from the semiclassical setup enunciated so far version of lqc the quantum connection @xmath124 is not a linear function of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the role of the curvature in expanding and bouncing scenarios is still to be assessed . ] .",
    "there is another , independent source of concern .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is related to representation choices when quantizing inverse volumes in the matter hamiltonian .",
    "a similar representation ambiguity arises also in the gravitational sector .",
    "thus the classical term @xmath125 becomes a function @xmath126 which is approximated by @xmath32 when @xmath127 ( @xmath34 is fixed to @xmath128 @xcite or @xmath7 @xcite ) .    in order for the inverse volume corrections to have significant impact on the dynamics",
    ", one has to quantize the hamiltonian using the representation of the gauge group different than fundamental ( @xmath129 ) . as a matter of fact , the semiclassical regime discussed above makes sense only in this ` large @xmath39 ' representation ;",
    "otherwise , there is no intermediate stage between the discrete quantum regime and the continuum classical limit .    for consistency",
    ", we should choose the same representation both for geometric objects in the gravitational term of the hamiltonian and for those in the matter sector .",
    "however , in the higher @xmath39 case the hamiltonian constraint is a difference equation of higher - than - second order .",
    "this may lead to an enlargement of the physical hilbert space and , as a consequence , to the presence of solutions with incorrect large - volume limit @xcite .",
    "even if this were not the case , there is evidence ( in 2 + 1 dimensions the proof is actually complete ) that lqg has a well - defined continuum limit to quantum field theory only in the fundamental representation of the gauge group @xcite . as said above , for small @xmath39 the semiclassical phase either is reduced or disappears altogether .",
    "these issues are not completely settled but they would deeply modify the ` old ' quantization adopted here as working model , with corresponding change in the physical picture of the early universe representation problem and the matter / gravity consistent representation problem are reinterpreted , and eventually relaxed , as natural features related to those of inhomogeneous backgrounds on a rigid lattice . ] . bearing them in mind , we shall try nonetheless to compute the power spectrum and the scalar spectral index",
    ". it would be interesting to compare our results in the absence of metric backreaction with those with full perturbations ( initiated in @xcite ; the same background equations are used ) .",
    "this would allow to verify what kind of approximations in the treatment of the cosmological problem preserve the physical features of the model .",
    "one can evaluate the maximum amount of superinflation during the semiclassical regime by requiring it to start at the planck era ( @xmath130 ) and to end at @xmath131 .",
    "the number of @xmath132-foldings @xmath133 $ ] is then n_max=(a_*/a_)=12(j/3 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath134 in order to get @xmath135 , which is far beyond the allowed upper limit determined by particle physics .",
    "then semiclassical superinflation alone is not sufficient to solve the flatness problem .",
    "one might invoke some mechanism lowering the minimum number of @xmath132-folds ( an example in classical cosmology is thermal inflation @xcite ) but @xmath39 would be still very large ; for example , @xmath136 requires @xmath137 , unrealistic in the quantum theory .    assuming the universe accelerates even after the semiclassical - to - classical transition",
    ", would it be possible to see effects of an early semiclassical stage in the power spectrum ?",
    "the range of observable large - scale structures roughly spans the last ten @xmath132-foldings ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; these will pertain the classical period , and only predictions of standard inflation should be expected .",
    "the details of the model may still be tuned so that to get a semiclassical modification of the scalar spectrum at low multipoles ( very large scales ) ; in particular , any deviation from scale invariance in the calculations below should be thought of as occurring in that region of the spectrum .",
    "moreover , we note that , as argued in @xcite , the horizon and flatness problems are solved if the relative change in the comoving horizon @xmath138 , not that of @xmath139 , is large enough .",
    "namely , inflation is more precisely characterized by the number of @xmath132-foldings |n(t ) . in the standard case",
    "@xmath107 is almost constant and this definition coincides with the previous one . in the semiclassical case ,",
    "it would enhance @xmath140 by a term @xmath141 , which is positive since @xmath107 increases in time .",
    "hence , a smaller @xmath39 is required to get a certain number of @xmath132-folds .    in the case under scrutiny , we will compute the power spectrum under the assumption of a de sitter background , later extending the result to a situation where the hubble parameter can vary in time as @xmath142 ( see section [ vali ] ) .",
    "then superacceleration can in principle relax the high-@xmath39 problem .",
    "we perturb the scalar field around the homogeneous background @xmath143 , and substitute @xmath144 in equation ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "going to momentum space , one has _",

    "this transient period may be then responsible for loss of power at large scales , and an indirect signature of loop quantum gravity if the field reaches maximum displacement from the potential minimum at least 60 @xmath132-folds before the end of inflation ( here we have seen that low - momenta suppression of the spectrum can be also a direct lqc effect ) .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the analyses of @xcite to other inflaton potentials with general ambiguity parameter @xmath34 and @xmath39 relaxed to even small values .",
    "on the other hand , if inflation takes place when the discrete structure of spacetime can not yet be approximated by a continuum , one might be able to put nontrivial constraints on the theory by considering the full lqc regime and its difference equations .",
    "however , one would require explicit expressions for quantum observables which have not yet been determined .",
    "the task seems difficult but worth being explored .",
    "another trend of research might try to extend the matter hamiltonian to a more general content . in @xcite , for instance , the scalar field is assumed to be nonminimally coupled to gravity .",
    "scalars not satisfying a klein  gordon equation at the classical level can produce qualitatively different , and possibly more viable , stages of inflation .",
    "we note , however , that certain alternative choices presently in fashion , like the dirac  born  infeld tachyon , are motivated mainly by string theory , and their application to lqc @xcite should be regarded as purely phenomenological .",
    "one of the most remarkable results of lqg is the proof of the bekenstein  hawking area law by counting the nonperturbative quantum states of a nonextremal black hole , a computation which fixes the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter @xcite . in general",
    ", it was shown that the area law is valid for all isolated horizons , including the cosmological ones , in the limit of large area ( @xmath333 or so ) .",
    "then the entropy of a ds horizon with radius @xmath334 is @xmath335 . by interpreting the friedmann equation @xmath336 as the ( integrated ) first law of ds thermodynamics @xmath337 , where @xmath338 is an infinitesimal energy exchange through the horizon @xcite , the ds temperature is indeed the gibbons  hawking temperature @xmath339 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of a klein  gordon field is @xmath340 .",
    "it will be important to verify the thermodynamical interpretation of the friedmann equation also for small volumes as in the semiclassical regime . in that case",
    ", logarithmic corrections to the entropy @xmath341 should be taken into account .",
    "in fact , during semiclassical inflation one can not use the large - volume expression @xmath335 , because @xmath342 for @xmath343 ( for larger @xmath39 there may be an allowed window but at this stage the interpretation of @xmath315 as a modified hawking temperature is not clear ) .",
    "considerations on the canonical partition function of a quantum system in equilibrium suggest that the above holographic principle might hold in general , also in this regime , because the bulk hamiltonian ( and not the boundary one ) is a constraint for the spectrum of physical states @xcite .",
    "although the de sitter approximation ( that is , @xmath24 as a test field with no backreaction from the metric ) is generally a good one in standard inflation , it is not obvious that it is as well justified in lqc . actually , the symmetry reduction of the full theory is performed under the very special assumption of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "but even small inhomogeneous perturbations can have drastic effects @xcite , and quantization of an anisotropic hamiltonian may lead to a rather different set of equations and spectra .",
    "important open issues to be considered in much greater detail are the choice of the ( vacuum ? )",
    "state on which to evaluate the two - point correlation function of the scalar perturbation , the choice of gauge ( is the flat gauge @xmath228 consistent ? ) and gauge - invariant observables , the adiabaticity of perturbations , and the behaviour of the tensor spectrum , yet to be determined altogether .",
    "the impact of geometrical backreaction should be assessed and what has been shown in this paper be checked by a more rigorous calculation in order to be considered reliable .",
    "if this were the case , the standard technique we adopted would prove to be a useful , relatively simple tool of analysis for loop quantum cosmology .",
    "gc was supported by marie curie intra - european fellowship meif - ct-2006 - 024523 , and mc by fct ( portugal ) .",
    "we thank a r liddle , d j mulryne , p majumdar and p singh for useful discussions , and m bojowald for careful reading of the original manuscript and stimulating insights .",
