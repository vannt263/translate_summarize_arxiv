    "therefore @xmath45 represents a lower bound for the energy gap above the anyonic vacuum , irrespective of the boundary conditions . in the remaining part of this subsection , we thus study @xmath6 and derive how the energy cost @xmath48 scales with @xmath1",
    "this is justified since , as we will show in sec .",

    "no operation exists that can move an anyon from an @xmath217-plaquette to a @xmath18-plaquette , or vice - versa .",
    "creation , movement and annilation of anyons are therefore achieved by pauli operations .",
    "using single spin operations , creation of a pair will always lead to the anyons occupying neighboring plaquettes ( where neighoring means that they share exactly one spin ) .",
    "similarly , single spin operations can only move anyons from one plaquette to a neigboring one , or annihilate anyons on neighboring plaquettes .",
    "since we assume that the system - bath coupling supports only single spin errors , it is exactly these processes that we consider during thermalization .",
    "however , it should be remembered that two - spin perturbations may also be present in the hamiltonian .",
    "local two - spin errors should therefore also be considered , which can create , annihilate and transport anyons on next - to - neighboring plaquettes .    with this in mind , we wish to split both @xmath217- and @xmath18-plaquettes into two groups , one of which will be strongly to the hopping bosons with a coupling @xmath207 and the other of which will be weakly coupled with a strength @xmath222 .",
    "this will give the plaquettes of the former a higher chemical potential than those of the latter , with an energy difference that increases linearly with system size .",

    "secondly , it should not be possible for anyons to be moved from one weakly coupled plaquette ( or a small cluster of weakly coupled plaquettes ) to another by a sequence of either single- or two - spin operations without passing through a strongly coupled plaquette .",

    "regions of strongly coupled plaquettes that do not neighbor weakly coupled plaquettes are separated from each other by a width of three spins .",
    "sequences of one- and two - spin operations therefore can not move anyons in one such region to another without going via strongly coupled plaquettes that do neighbor weakly coupled plaquettes , which will almost certainly result in the anyon decaying into the neighboring weakly coupled plaquettes .",
    "similarly , regions of weakly coupled plaquettes are separated by the same width , preventing movement between them without going via strongly coupled plaquettes .",
    "the initial movement of anyons on strongly coupled plaquettes to nearby weakly coupled plaquettes may cause ambiguity for error correction if the error rate during initialization is too high .",
    "even so , for sufficiently low error rates this movement will have no effect on correctability . once the movement is complete",
    ", the exponential suppression of diffusion will then ensure that the correctability of the errors is preserved for a time exponential with the system size , since such an exponentially long timescale will be required for the anyons to climb out of the weakly coupled plaquettes .",
    "we will now demonstrate that the difference in chemical potentials between strongly and weakly coupled plaquettes leads to the energy barrier required to suppress diffusion . to determine the chemical potential of an arbitrary plaquette @xmath223 ( which is either @xmath217- or @xmath18-type ) , the following sum over all plaquettes",

    "note that all strongly coupled plaquettes in this tiling are triangular .",
    "the @xmath236 for these will therefore be three - body operators , making the code - hopping boson coupling only a four - body term .",
    "on the other hand , weakly coupled plaquettes are octagons with eight - body @xmath236 and nine - body terms required for the code - hopping boson coupling . since these many - body terms will most likely be generated by perturbative methods , with a higher number of spins in a term generated by higher orders of perturbation theory , the difference in coupling strengths will arise naturally .    due to the practical difficultly in generating many - body terms , we can consider not coupling the octagonal plaquettes to the hopping bosons . only the four - body terms required to couple the triangles",
    "are then needed , which should be easier to implement than the five - body terms required for the square tiling . despite the fact that only a fraction of the plaquettes are coupled to hopping bosons , the memory is still stable against thermal errors .",
    "this is because any single spin error must still create at least one anyon on , or move anyons through , energetically penalized triangular plaquettes .",
    "the energy barrier that increases linearly with system size is therefore still intact , and ensures that anyon creation and diffusion are exponentially suppressed .",
    "unfortunately , stability against local hamiltonian perturbations does not remain strong without the coupling of octagons . without an energy penalty ,",
    "two - body perturbations are free to create and move anyons between next - to - neighboring octagonal plaquettes .",
    "this avoids the energy barrier and so leads to uncorrectable errors in a constant time .",
    "however , it is possible to avoid this by carefully considering what types of perturbation are present , and then designing the @xmath236 such that they are unable to perform such hopping processes .",
    "for example , let us use @xmath237 for triangular @xmath217-plaquettes . here",
    "spin @xmath238 is that shared with the neighboring triangular @xmath217-plaquette and the numbering proceeds clockwise .",
    "let us also use @xmath239 for triangular @xmath18-plaquettes with corresponding numbering .",
    "no nearest neighbor isotropic perturbation of the form @xmath240 , for @xmath241 , commutes with all of these operators .",
    "this means such perturbations will be suppressed by the energy barrier and will not be able to move anyons between octagonal plaquettes .",
    "if only perturbations of this form are present in the system , the memory will remain stable .",
    "in this section , we would like to point out a physical system where bosonic modes ( as discussed in the previous sections ) naturally occur as a lowest order approximation .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonians ( [ eq : boson ] ) and ( [ eq : perturbation_z ] ) are closely related to the hamiltonians describing a toric code embedded in a 3d heisenberg ferromagnet ( fm ) in a broken - symmetry state at finite temperature . more explicitly ,",
    "let us consider the following hamiltonian @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the hamiltonian of a 3d heisenberg ferromagnet ( fm ) of linear size @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is the exchange coupling constant and the sum is restricted to nearest - neighbor lattice sites .",
    "the fm is assumed to be below the curie temperature and the spins ordered along the @xmath246-direction .",
    "we can now perform a holstein - primakoff transformation  @xcite @xmath247 in the formal limit @xmath248 , where @xmath249  @xcite .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that the low - energy sector of hamiltonian ( [ eq : ferrox ] ) is equivalent to hamiltonian ( [ eq : boson ] ) .",
    "following the same reasoning , we conclude that the hamiltonian @xmath250 is in its low - energy sector equivalent to hamiltonian ( [ eq : perturbation_z ] ) .",
    "however , since all operators in hamiltonians @xmath251 and @xmath252 are bounded , it is clear that the energy penalty for flipping a toric code spin very fast can not grow without bounds as a function of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "still , it seems reasonable to expect that for adiabatic noise sources , that drag the fm along while flipping a spin , the response of the fm resembles the one of the bosonic bath studied in this work , since the stabilizers are coupled via the susceptibility of the fm .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the toric code might be protected against such adiabatic noise sources when embedded in the fm .",
    "note that the question of how to engineer five - spin interactions , as required for hamiltonians @xmath251 and @xmath252 , remains open .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a 3d - model with purely local , bounded - strength interactions in three dimensions that is self - correcting at finite temperatures .",
    "our model is exactly solvable and consists of a toric code locally coupled to a system of hopping bosons on a cubic lattice .",
    "the stabilizer operators are locally coupled to the displacement operator of the bosons and a long - range attractive interaction between stabilizer operators is mediated by the low - energy collective excitations of the bosonic system .",
    "this leads to a chemical potential for the anyons growing linearly with @xmath1 and can be used to stabilize the quantum memory against thermal fluctuations . for a given error model",
    ", a chemical potential of the anyons that grows linearly with @xmath1 leads to a lifetime of the quantum memory increasing exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "when the stabilizers are coupled to the bosonic density , a chemical potential growing only with @xmath7 is derived .",
    "we show that such a chemical potential is enough to stabilize the memory whose lifetime increases polynomially with @xmath1 .",
    "if the degeneracy of the highly entangled states which form the code subspace is not robust against local perturbations , uncontrolled splitting of this degeneracy induced by local imperfections would lead to dephasing of the logical qubit .",
    "it was already argued in ref .",
    "@xcite and rigorously proved in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the standard toric code hamiltonian @xcite , perturbations which are weak enough ( compared with the anyon creation gap ) , time - independent , and local ( or exponentially decaying ) lead to a lifting of the groundstate degeneracy that is exponentially small in @xmath1 . since our hamiltonian is not gapped and involves unbounded operators , the result of ref .",
    "@xcite do not apply . while we consider a rigorous treatment of this issue to be beyond the scope of the present work , which focuses on stability against thermal errors rather than perturbations , we briefly present arguments suggesting that robustness to local perturbations is valid in our model .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , in any real solid the degrees of freedom that do not directly constitute the `` memory '' ( spins of the toric code ) represent a gapless environment to which the memory couples .",
    "this situation is not addressed by studies of perturbations which act entirely within the hilbert space of the memory , as is the case in ref .",
    "the issue of accidental couplings to gapless modes is therefore by no means unique to our quantum memory proposal and will be present in any physical implementation of a quantum memory . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors discuss topological phases coupled to a gapless environment , and find that in some cases ( `` strong quasi - topological phases '' ) the topological properties , including the exponentially suppressed groundstate splitting , survive this coupling .",
    "such strong quasi - topological phases , including the toric code coupled to a gapless environment ( such as accoustic phonons or photons ) , thus constitute the strongest form of a quantum memory one could hope for in nature  except for the fact that they are not thermally stable .",
    "our memory _ is _ thermally stable and in the following we present heuristic arguments that in our system couplings to the gapless modes may not pose a threat to the topological order either .",
    "recall that engineered couplings of strength @xmath253 ( see hamiltonian ( [ eq : boson ] ) ) between the stabilizer operators and the bosonic modes lead to an anyon creation gap of the order @xmath254 .",
    "now consider accidental couplings of the form @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is a bit - flip that acts on a physical qubit of the toric code .",
    "in second - order perturbation theory , the coupling to the bosonic field leads to terms of the form @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "summing over all plaquettes the former terms take the form @xmath259 ; the condition that these perturbations are sufficiently weak compared to the anyon creation gap simply translates into the requirement that @xmath260 is sufficiently small compared to @xmath253 , i.e. , that the accidental couplings are sufficiently weak compared to the engineered ones .",
    "the second - order terms describing interactions between bit - flips are weaker and will have support only on two small regions , which for most pairs @xmath26 and @xmath261 are well - separated .",
    "this does not allow anyons to hop non - locally , as would be required to distinguish the ground states . despite their non - local form , these perturbations are therefore still similar in effect to local perturbations .",
    "we thus believe that our hamiltonian is robust against this type of perturbations and splitting of the ground - state degeneracy is well - suppressed with @xmath1 .",
