    "a repulsively interacting fermi gas can be realized by rapidly quenching the atoms to a metastable state in the absence of bound - state ( molecule ) formation at the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) side of a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "an important goal is to study the itinerant ferromagnetism in repulsive fermi systems @xcite , which is a long - standing problem in many - body physics .",
    "the interaction energy has been measured by studying the expansion properties @xcite or by using rf spectroscopy @xcite . in an expansion experiment on a @xmath0li",
    "fermi gas @xcite around its broad feshbach resonance at magnetic field @xmath1 g and at temperature @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fermi temperature , it was found that the interaction energy of the repulsive branch suddenly jumps to negative values at magnetic field @xmath4 g , which lies at the bec side of the resonance .",
    "the same feature was also indicated by rf spectroscopy measurement in a two - dimensional fermi gas @xcite .",
    "a repulsive fermi gas was previously suggested to exist in the upper branch of a strongly interacting fermi gas @xcite .",
    "however , the  upper branch \" is well defined only for two - body systems . exact solution of the energy levels of three attractively interacting fermions in a harmonic trap @xcite shows that there are many avoided crossings between the lowest two branches as one approaches the resonance , making it difficult to identify a repulsive fermi system .",
    "so far there is no precise formulation of it for many - body systems . in this paper",
    ", we study a metastable many - body state of a strongly interacting fermi gas in the absence of molecule formation , or containing only scattering states @xcite . in the high - temperature limit",
    "it can be formulated by using the virial expansion to the second order in the fugacity because the two - body contribution dominates @xcite . moreover , in the weak - coupling limit ( both the bcs and bec limits ) , the equation of state of such a system can be described perturbatively @xcite .",
    "the sudden jump of the interaction energy at the bec side of the resonance can be qualitatively explained by the strong atom loss around @xmath5 g , where the system may be regarded as a mixture of atoms and weakly bound molecules @xcite .",
    "shenoy and ho @xcite rather suggested that the interaction energy of the repulsive branch was found to increase and then decrease as one approaches the resonance from the bec side , showing a maximum before reaching the resonance . by using a generalized nozi@xmath6res - schmitt - rink ( nsr ) approach where the molecular contribution is subtracted , they found that an energy maximum already appears at high temperature @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , the nsr approach to the repulsive branch is limited to the high - temperature region where the chemical potential becomes negative and the fugacity is small .",
    "it becomes less accurate and predicts artificial discontinuities and instability at low temperature @xcite .",
    "moreover , at low temperature , since the compressibility becomes negative in a large forbidden area , the number equation has no solution and hence the generalized nsr approach can not provide quantitative predictions .    in this paper",
    ", we follow shenoy and ho s explanation of the behavior of the interaction energy but employ an alternative nonperturbative approach at zero temperature to overcome the difficulty of a negative compressibility .",

    "the interaction energy @xmath8 can be formally expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gas parameter .",
    "obviously , the result becomes perturbative at weak coupling @xmath11 .",
    "the basic requirement for this resummation is that the interaction energy converges in the strong - coupling limit @xmath12 .",
    "according to bishop @xcite , there exist two different schemes to calculate the perturbative equation of state @xcite , the bethe - goldstone scheme and the galitskii - feynman ( gf ) scheme .",
    "if the perturbative contributions can be computed and summed precisely to all orders in @xmath10 , they should agree with each other .",

    "this phenomenon can be understood qualitatively through the nature of the binary interaction in the medium : the in - medium scattering phase shift shows attraction at low energy and hence reduces the interaction energy before reaching the resonance .",
