[ main - prop ] in theorem [ th1 ] the condition can be replaced by @xmath153    as we said for three interval exchange maps we have @xmath154 . from",

    ". then @xmath150 satisfies sarnak s disjointness conjecture .",
    "now we turn to the estimation of the constant @xmath115 . in the proof of theorem [ thm ]",
    "bourgain , first estimates the @xmath210 norm of the polynomials @xmath211 , namely the lemmas 3 and 4 in @xcite . for the result",
    "it is also essential to slow down the growth of the @xmath210 norm of the polynomial @xmath211 , whenever @xmath212 ( see lemma 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "this condition is achieved by assuming that the lengths @xmath213 of the words in the symbolic representations grow sufficiently fast , i.e. conditions and .",
    "one of the key places where this is used is lemma 4 .",
    "to estimate how big the constant @xmath115 has to be we will follow bourgains steps and give more quantitative proof of this lemma .    first we note the following .",
    "let @xmath214 be a sequence of words with @xmath155 , where each @xmath193 participates in the symbolic representation of @xmath215 . then according to the assumptions and one has @xmath216 in the same way @xmath217 we note that there may be only finitely many indexes where the above inequalities do not hold , but that will not affect our estimates .",
    "multiplying together the inequalities in and we will have @xmath218 which leads to @xmath219 hence @xmath220    now back to lemma 4 .",
    "we observe that the proof of the lemma is based on the inequality @xmath221 , i.e. @xmath222    the proof of , in its turn , is based on lemma 3 .",
    "we note , that in the proof of lemma 3 , bourgain does nt use any particular property of the polynomial @xmath211 and since the inequality holds for any polynomial @xmath223 , we can assume , that @xmath224 .",
    "so we will end up with the following inequality @xmath225 we know @xmath226 hence @xmath227 @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the dirichlet kernel for which one has ( e.g. , see @xcite ) @xmath230 so we conclude , that @xmath231 dividing both sides by @xmath232 and tending @xmath20 to infinity we get , that @xmath233 next we estimate the @xmath234 in @xmath235 of @xcite . for this",
    "we refer to the inequality @xmath236 in @xcite . in @xmath237 and",
    "@xmath238 bourgain defines the minor and major arcs , which depend on parameters @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "lemma 6 yields the inequality @xmath241 . for arcs which are sufficiently close to rational numbers with large denominators ( i.e. when @xmath240 is large ) or sufficiently far from the rationals with small denominator ( i.e. when @xmath239 is large ) applying lemma 6 one gets the inequality @xmath241 . furthermore applying lemma 4 and",
    "the inequality @xmath241 we get @xmath242 or dividing both sides by @xmath243 @xmath244 now from bourgain assumes , that @xmath245 .",
    "but this is possible only , if @xmath246 and from lemma 6 we see , that @xmath247 .",
    "so we conclude , that @xmath248 now we return to the proof of lemma 6 in @xcite .",
    "to obtain the formula @xmath235 bourgain uses the inequality to iterate the formulas - , i.e. for @xmath129 one gets @xmath249 iterating further the polynomials @xmath250 at step @xmath13 we will get at most @xmath251 many members of the form @xmath252 ( we say @xmath251 since in the formulas - at most 4 subwords appear ) . now using , the geometric arithmetic - mean inequality one gets    @xmath253    as @xmath254 therefore @xmath255 however we will neglect the coefficient @xmath251 in the above inequality ( which amount to saying , that at each step of the iteration of we have only @xmath189 member , or @xmath215 is a power of @xmath193 ) . note that it makes the left hand of grow slower .",
    "so we will have the inequality @xmath256 and since @xmath257 , then @xmath258 or @xmath259 denote @xmath260 .",
    "hence @xmath261 now consider @xmath262 and compute @xmath263 for the critical point of @xmath264 we find @xmath265 then @xmath266 so we see , that if @xmath267 for large @xmath268 , then @xmath269 . but",
    "we know that @xmath270 so we arrive at the following claim    [ clm ] the constant @xmath115 in theorem [ th2 ] satisfies the following estimate @xmath271    as we see the constant @xmath272 in theorem [ th2 ] must be quite large . but in this paper we will only assume that @xmath273 .",
    "now we are ready to formulate the main theorem of this paper    [ mainth ] under the conditions of theorem [ th1 ] , sarnak s disjointness conjecture holds for all @xmath96 , for which their associated three - interval expansion sequence @xmath99 fulfils the conditions @xmath274 for all @xmath208 and some large @xmath209 and for the hausdorff dimension of the set @xmath275 we have the following estimates @xmath276 where @xmath277 and the function @xmath278 is defined in .",
