    "in this section , we briefly show basic features of @xmath5sr measurements in zero field ( zf ) , weak transverse field ( wtf ) and transverse field ( tf ) , together with time spectra obtained on single crystal specimens of ( ba@xmath1k@xmath1)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 in the present work . figure 5(a )",
    "shows the zf-@xmath5sr spectra .",
    "the appearance of oscillations below @xmath33 k indicates an onset of a static internal field from static fe moments .",
    "the amplitude of this signal is proportional to the fraction of muons landing in the region with static magnetic order .",
    "the frequency is proportional to the magnitude of the static internal field , and thus to the size of the ordered fe moments . in the case of fig .",
    "5(a ) , the oscillation frequency of @xmath12 20 mhz signal corresponds to an internal field of about 1.5 kg .",
    "the damping of this oscillation is caused by a dephasing process due to an inhomogneity of the static internal field caused by short - range static spin correlations , or incommensurate magnetism , and/or possible effects of randomness and imperfections .",
    "in general , fluctuating internal fields due to dynamic spin fluctuations and/or spin waves can also cause damping of the oscillation through the energy - dissipative @xmath34 processes .",
    "static and dynamic origins of the damping can be distinguished by their different responses in @xmath5sr spectra to application of longitudinal external fields .",
    "long - lived oscillation signals in zf can be expected for commensurate long - ranged static magnetism , as shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 2(a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for the cases of the parent compounds of the 1111 and 122 feas systems .    when a weak , external transverse field ( wtf ) of typically 30 - 100 g is applied , muon spins in the paramagnetic or non - magnetic environment exhibit slow coherent precession around the wtf , as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) . in magnetically - ordered regions of most magnetic systems ,",
    "a static internal field from surrounding ordered moments at the muon site is much larger than the applied wtf . as a result",
    ", those muon spins can not join in the wtf precession and the signal from the magntically - ordered region usually disappears within about @xmath35 ns in wtf measurements .",
    "this is due to inhomogeneous broadening of the vector sums of the internal plus external fields .",
    "the remaining slowly - oscillating signal represents contributions from the other muons in the paramagnetic environment . as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) , it is very straightforward to derive the amplitude of this slow oscillation . figures 1(b ) and 3(a ) of the present work and figs .",
    "1(c ) and 3(c ) of ref .",
    "@xcite show the amplitude of such slowly oscillating signals in wtf .",
    "this procedure provides another method to estimate volume fractions of the ordered and paramagnetic regions , in addition to the zf precession signal amplitude which represents the former .",
    "the results from the wtf and zf methods usually agree well , as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) of ref . @xcite .    in type - ii superconductors below @xmath14 ,",
    "the application of an external field above @xmath25 leads to the formation of a flux vortex lattice inside the superconductor , which has a well - defined field distribution @xcite .",
    "this field distribution causes additional damping of the precession signal in both wtf and tf-@xmath5sr measurements .",
    "this feature can be seen in wtf spectra in fig .",
    "5(b ) below @xmath14 = 37 k. the optimal value of tf to study the effect of the penetration depth and flux vortex lattice , however , generally ranges between 100 - 3000 g , since it should be above @xmath25 and well below @xmath22 , with the distance between the adjacent flux vortices significantly smaller than the penetration depth . in the present study",
    ", we chose to apply tf = 500 g , and performed measurements in the field - cooling procedure .",
    "figure 5(c ) shows the time spectra of tf-@xmath5sr , from which we derived the relaxation rate @xmath15 in fig .",
    "a piston - cylinder - type pressure cell was used to generate hydrostatic pressures up to @xmath12 10 kbar in the present work .",
    "the cylinder is made of a non - magnetic alloy mp35n and has an inside diameter of 7 mm and a wall thickness of 8 mm .",
    "figure 6 shows some photos of this cell and a schematic drawing of the @xmath5sr spectrometer used in high pressure measurements .",
    "the sample space was filled with a pressure - transmitting medium of daphne oil 7373 .",
    "the pressure cell was pressurized at room temperature before it was mounted in the cryostat and the pressure was maintained by using cube screws .",
    "the pressure was generally found to decease by approximately 3 kbar at low temperatures due to a thermal contraction difference between the cell and the pressure - transmitting medium . in this paper",
    ", we used the low - temperatures - range pressure which was calibrated from the pressure dependence of superconducting temperature in pb .",
    "previous @xmath5sr measurements on mnsi @xcite , performed using this instrument at 0 - 16 kbar , reproduced the magnetic ordering temperatures and sharp features at phase boundaries reported in prior measurements by other techniques using different pressure cells .",
    "sharp variations of @xmath5sr results have also been observed in our unpublished @xmath5sr work on uge@xmath0 .",
    "although these observations in other magnetic systems may or may not be generalized to the case of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 which exhibits a large change of the unit cell volume in the pressure range of the present work @xcite , the reproducibility and sharp aspects assure that the pressure cell used in the present work is as good , uniform and accurate as typical piston - cylinder cells currently used in various high pressure experiments in terms of homogeneity and absolute values of the generated pressure .",
    "in magnetic systems that exhibit commensurate long - range , static magnetic order , neutron scattering observes magnetic bragg peaks , while @xmath5sr often finds long - lived coherent precession in zf below the ordering temperature .",
    "this was the case for laofeas , as published in refs . @xcite which report neutron and @xmath5sr measurements performed using an identical piece of sintered polycrystalline specimen .",
    "neutron measurements are generally limited by small intensities of magnetic bragg peaks , especially for the case of polycrystalline specimens having moments smaller than @xmath12 0.5 bohr magnetons per unit cell .",
    "in contrast , @xmath5sr has a superb sensitivity for detecting small or random static moments , as even nuclear dipolar moments can be easily detected . in ndofeas ,",
    "neutron studies initially reported the absence of static magnetic order , while @xmath5sr measurements found a static magnetic order very similar to that of laofeas @xcite .",
    "the magnetic bragg peaks in this material were subsequently observed after repeated measurements with higher statistics @xcite .",
    "this incident demonstrates the potential difficulty in detecting static magnetic order by neutron scattering , even for the case of systems with long - range spin correlations .    for static magnetic order involving short - range or incommensurate or stripe spin correlations , it becomes even more difficult for neutron measurements to detect the onset of ordering , since the intensity is spread in a wider region of momentum space . as an example , here we will compare neutron and @xmath5sr results obtained in a ceramic polycrystalline specimen of ce(o@xmath36f@xmath37)feas .",
    "this system is not superconducting , but lies in the border region between the magnetically - ordered and suprconducting phases , as elucidated by neutron scattering studies @xcite .",
    "the bragg peak intensity for this 6%f doped system was very low , and static order was detected only below @xmath12 10 k. in contrast , @xmath5sr detected static order below t @xmath12 40 k as shown by the oscillation amplitude in wtf-@xmath5sr in fig .",
    "the asymmetry of @xmath12 0.2 at high temperatures corresponds to the value expected for fully paramagnetic systems , while the loss of the asymmetry below 40 k indicates a sharp onset of static magnetic order in 100 %  of the volume fraction .",
    "the frequency of the muon precession in zf-@xmath5sr ( fig .",
    "7(b ) ) shows that the ordered moment size is about 0.1 bohr magnetons .",
    "this apparent difference of ordering behavior found by neutrons and muons can be understood when we look at the spectra of zf-@xmath5sr in fig .",
    "the spectra at t = 5k exhibits a fast damping corresponding to a very short - ranged character of static fe spin correlations .",
    "the faster damping seen at t = 2 k is most - likely caused by imminent ordering of ce .",
    "these examples on ndofeas and ce(o , f)feas demonstrate that different magnetic behaviors found by neutrons and muons can be caused by different sensitivities of these probes to static magnetic order .",
    "this general argument provides a possible explanation for the static magnetic order of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 found in a wider pressure region in the present @xmath5sr measurements as compared to that found by neutron scattering studies @xcite .",
    "an increasingly short - ranged spin correlation is found with increasing pressure by the present studies of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , as demonstrated by the zf-@xmath5sr spectra in fig .",
    "frequencies observed in zf-@xmath5sr measurements are generally proportional to the size of the static ordered moment within a given series of magnetic materials having the same crystal structures and an identical muon site location in the unit cell .",
    "however , the conversion from the frequency to the fe moment size is not easy in feas - based systems , since the accurate location of the muon site is not known .",
    "the argument in supplementary doc .",
    "c indicates that neutron scattering intensity is not much reliable for this purpose either .",
    "in contrast , the hyperfine splitting observed in moessbauer effect measurements can provides a more reliable estimate of the size of the static fe moments . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , comparisons of @xmath5sr frequencies and moessbauer hyperfine fields observed in laofeas , bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite indicate that the hyperfine coupling constants between the muon spin and the fe moment are nearly equal for the 1111 and 122 systems , with a difference of about 10 % .    therefore , we plot the @xmath5sr freqencies in the vertical axis of fig .",
    "4 without corrections between the 1111 and 122 systems .",
    "the absolute value of the moment was scaled based on the moessbauer results in ref .",
    "@xcite for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the resulting fe moment size , shown in the right - vertical axis of fig .",
    "4 , involves about 10 % error due to the difference between the 1111 and 122 systems .",
    "the results of this conversion agree rather well with the estimates from neutron scattering studies which reported 0.36 and 0.8 bohr magnetons for fe moments in laofeas @xcite and cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite respectively .",
    "different moessbauer measurements reported in the literature have adopted different conversion factors between the hyperfine splitting and the fe moment size @xcite , resulting in estimates for the ordered moment size in laofeas that differ in magnitude up to 40 % .",
    "this ambiguity leads to a systematic error for the absolute moment values in fig .",
    "the relative comparison of the moment size between different systems , however , can be made with the accuracy of + /-",
    "10 % , assuming that the muon site does not change among materials within each series ( 1111 and 122 ) .",

    "<S> here we show that superconductivity in the afe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( a = ca , ba , sr ) systems , in both the cases of composition and pressure tunings , coexists with a strong static magnetic order in a partial volume fraction . </S>",
    "<S> the superfluid response from the remaining paramagnetic volume fraction of ( ba@xmath1k@xmath1)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 exhibits a nearly linear variation in t at low temperatures , suggesting an anisotropic energy gap with line nodes and/or multi - gap effects . </S>",
    "<S> *    the announcement of superconductivity in la(o , f)feas ( @xmath2 k ) in february 2008 @xcite triggered an unprecedented burst of research activities in feas - based superconductors and their parent systems . by now </S>",
    "<S> , superconductivity has been reported in systems with four different crystal structures , i.e. , the `` 1111 '' systems re(o , f)feas with rare earth = la , nd , ce , etc . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the `` 122 '' systems afe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( a = ba , sr , ca ) tuned by chemical substitutions @xcite or application of hydrostatic pressure @xcite , the `` 111 '' li@xmath3feas @xcite , and the `` 011 '' @xmath4-fese systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> extensive measurements by neutron scattering @xcite , moessbauer effect @xcite and muon spin relaxation ( @xmath5sr ) @xcite have been performed to characterize magnetism and superfluid responses . </S>",
    "<S> notable results include the observations of collinear antiferromagnetic order in undoped parent compounds of the 1111 and 122 systems @xcite , hyperfine splitting of @xmath6fe moessbauer spectra and @xmath5sr frequencies indicative of a static moment size ranging between 0.3 - 0.8 bohr magnetons per fe @xcite , static magnetism in lightly - doped non - superconducting systems with possible incommensurate or stripe spin correlations @xcite , and nearly linear scaling between t@xmath7 and the superfluid density @xcite in the 1111 systems following the trend found in cuprate and other exotic superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> three systematic studies of magnetic phase diagrams of the 1111 systems @xcite , however , exhibit significantly different behaviors . as a function of increasing ( o , f ) substitution , la(o , f)feas shows an abrupt and first - order like evolution from an antiferromagnetic to superconducting state , ce(o , f)feas shows nearly second - order like evolution , and sm(o , f)feas exhibits phase - separated coexistence of static magnetism and superconductivity in a small concentration region around the phase boundary . despite these differences , superconductivity appears mostly in the region without static magnetic order in the 1111 systems , similarly to the case of the cuprates . in contrast </S>",
    "<S> , very little has been reported on the phase diagrams of the 122 systems . </S>",
    "<S> recent powder neutron measurements on ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite found a phase diagram similar to the one for sm(o , f)feas with coexisting long - range magnetic order and superconductivity near the phase boundary . due to the volume - integrated character of neutron instensity , however , information pertaining to the ordered volume fraction is missing in that work . </S>",
    "<S> we have also reported @xmath5sr measurements on a single crystal of ( ba@xmath8k@xmath9)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite which found the co - existence of phase - separated static magnetic order and superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the superfluid density of this crystal was much lower than that in the corresponding 1111 systems with comparable t@xmath7 s , which is suggestive of insufficient carrier doping . in the 122 systems , more definitive studies of magnetic phase diagrams </S>",
    "<S> can be expected due to the availability of large single crystals @xcite , recent improvement of the growth method , and applicability of pressure - tuning free from randomness due to substitution .    in this paper </S>",

    "<S> the former two crystals , prepared at the institute of physics in beijing using the feas flux method @xcite and weighing @xmath12 100 mg and 40 mg respectively , were mounted with their ab - planes perpendicular to the muon beam . over 1 g of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystals ( in more than 100 pieces ) , prepared in ames lab . using the sn flux method @xcite , </S>",

    "<S> the crystals were aligned with their ab - planes perpendicular to the muon beam at the m9b channel , where the initial muon spin polarization is tuned to be perpendicular to the beam direction . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5sr measurements were performed in zero field ( zf ) and weak transverse field ( wtf ) of @xmath12 30 - 50 g to study magnetic ordering , and in transverse field ( tf ) of 300 - 500 g to study superfluid density . a recent study on ( ca , sr)ruo@xmath13 and mnsi in applied pressure </S>",

    "<S> the solid lines show the reported results in the undoped parent compounds bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite and srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite . in both systems , </S>",
    "<S> static magnetism sets in at temperatures well above the superconducting @xmath14 s , in a large volume fraction of @xmath12 90 %  in the ( sr , na ) system and 50 %  in the ( ba , k ) system . </S>",
    "<S> we observed two different precession frequencies in a given system , presumably coming from two different muon sites , as was the case in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies in the superconducting samples are reduced from the values in the undoped compounds only by 20 - 30 % , indicating that static magnetic order with a significant fe moment size exists in the magnetically - ordered regions . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate phase separation between magnetically - ordered and paramagnetic volumes . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is difficult to estimate the length scale of each region from the @xmath5sr results alone .    in tf-@xmath5sr , </S>",

    "<S> an increase of @xmath15 was observed in both the ( ba , k ) and ( sr , na ) crystals below the superconducting @xmath14 s . since the statistical accuracy of the data is much better for the former system with the larger paramagnetic volume fraction , here we present the results of ( ba@xmath1k@xmath1)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 in tf = 500 g applied parallel to the c - axis in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the observed behavior is distinctly different from the case for an isotropic energy gap shown by the broken line representing a calculation for bcs s - wave coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the observed temperature dependence may be attributed to ( 1 ) line nodes in an anisotropic energy gap , or ( 2 ) widely different magnitudes of multiple isotropic gaps as seen in calculations @xcite based on multiple bands . </S>",

    "<S> the resulting point from the present ( ba , k ) crystal ( red solid square symbol ) indicates that the present system has a superfluid density close to those in the 1111 systems with comparable @xmath14 s , and that a sufficiently doped 122 feas system follows the nearly linear relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath24 found in the cuprates and 1111 systems . </S>",
    "<S> this result disagrees with the @xmath25 measurements on ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite which found the superfluid density to have a similar temperature dependence to our results , but the absolute values differed by a factor of @xmath12 4 . </S>",
    "<S> as experienced in early studies on various cuprate systems which reported widely scattered values of @xmath25 , the determination of @xmath25 can be affected by flux pinning . </S>",
    "<S> this feature might explain the origin of the disagreement .    </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting state can also be obtained by applying hydrostatic pressure to the undoped parent compounds of the 122 systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 system shows superconductivity below @xmath26 10 k at relatively low pressures @xmath11 of 3 - 8 kbar , which are attainable using the available @xmath5sr piston - cylinder pressure cell . </S>",
    "<S> note that this cell uses daphne oil as the pressure mediator . </S>",
    "<S> we studied static magnetic order of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 at ambient pressure and at @xmath11 = 3.9 , 6.2 and 9.9 kbar by performing wtf-@xmath5sr with wtf = 50 g. solid symbols in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the static magnetism disappears at @xmath11 = 9.9 kbar where the superconducting state no longer exists . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(b ) shows the low temperature ( @xmath27 ) values of the volume fraction of the magnetically - ordered region ( from wtf data ) as well as the muon spin precession frequency in zf-@xmath5sr , which is proportional to the size of the ordered fe moment . </S>",

    "<S> a rather sharp structural change detected by neutrons around @xmath11 = 3 kbar does not have a corresponding signature in the @xmath5sr data except for an onset of phase separation . at this moment , it is not clear whether these apparent differences are due to ( a ) different sensitivity of these three probes to magnetic order , as described in more detail in the on - line supplementary document c , or ( b ) to possibly different degrees of the strain gradient between measurements with pressure instruments using liquid and gas mediators , or to both ( a ) and ( b ) . </S>",

    "<S> since the fe - muon hyperfine coupling constants are different only by within 10 %  between the 1111 and 122 systems @xcite , the vertical axis is nearly proportional to the static fe moment size ( see on - line supplemental document d for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 indicates that static magnetism disappears when the system approaches the superconducting state in the 1111 systems , while significantly stronger magnetism ( with higher @xmath29 and larger moment size ) remains in the 122 systems deep into the superconducting pressure region . </S>",
