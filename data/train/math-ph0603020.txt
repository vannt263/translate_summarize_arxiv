    "it is shown that the adjacency operator of a homogeneous rooted tree can be written as @xmath294 for @xmath81 a completely non unitary isometry ( _ i.e. _  an isometry such that @xmath297 strongly ) . this fact is used to prove the existence of an operator @xmath298 ( called _ number operator _ ) sastisfying @xmath299 .",
    "@xmath298 is used to construct an operator @xmath300 , which is conjugate ( in the sense of mourre theory ) to @xmath9 and to some classes of perturbations of @xmath9 .",

    ", @xmath305 is admissible , since @xmath306 is obviously admissible .",
    "we shall not give details here since these are simple facts , largely covered by section [ dp ] .",
    "we present some examples of graphs ( admissible or not ) with an adapted function which can be easily drawn in the plane .",
    "although some of them might be subject to other treatments , we would like to stress the relative ease and unity of our approach , which also furnishes boundary estimates for the resolvent and applies to some classes of perturbations .",

    "the directed graph of figure [ graph4].(a ) is admissible and injective , so its adjacency operator has no singular continuous spectrum and no point spectrum .",
    "one shows easily that admissibility and injectivity are preserved under a finite or infinite number of vertical juxtapositions of the graph with itself ( see figure [ graph4].(b ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if one puts figure [ graph4].(a ) on top of itself , deletes all the arrows belonging to the middle row as well as the vertices left unconnected , one gets an admissible , non - injective directed graph .    the directed graph of figure [ graph5 ] is admissible , regular but not injective .",
    "the graph deduced from it is the cayley graph of @xmath317 , with generating system @xmath318 , without being a cartesian product .",
