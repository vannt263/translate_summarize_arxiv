    "in relativistic heavy - ion collisions large differences between the longitudinal and transverse expansion rates lead to large shear viscous effects , generating large anisotropies between the longitudinal and transverse pressures during the early stage of their evolution .",
    "these cause standard israel - stewart ( second - order ) viscous hydrodynamic theory ( see @xcite for a recent review ) to break down .",
    "anisotropic hydrodynamics @xcite ( ahydro ) deals with the large longitudinal / transverse pressure anisotropy , @xmath0 , `` non - perturbatively '' , thereby avoiding the occurrence of negative longitudinal pressures and improving the performance of hydrodynamics at early times @xcite . however , ahydro @xcite accounts only for one ( the largest ) of the five independendent components of the shear stress tensor @xmath1 .",
    "it can therefore not be used to compute the viscous suppression of elliptic flow which is sensitive to e.g. @xmath2 . on the other hand , since the four remaining components of the shear stress tensor never become as large as the longitudinal / transverse pressure difference ( with smooth initial density profiles they start out as zero , and with fluctuating initial conditions they are initially small ) , they can be treated `` perturbatively ''  la israel and stewart , without running into problems even at early times .",
    "combining the non - perturbative dynamics of @xmath0 via ahydro with a perturbative treatment of the remaining viscous stress terms @xmath3  la israel - stewart defines our new vahydro scheme .",
    "it is expected to perform better than both is theory and ahydro during all evolution stages .",
    "the physics behind different hydrodynamic approximations to the underlying microscopic dynamics is best illustrated by starting from the boltzmann equation and considering conditions ( weakly coupled microscopic dynamics and small pressure gradients on the macroscopic level ) where both approaches are simultaneously valid .",
    "the form of the resulting hydrodynamic equations ( but not the value of the associated transport coefficients ) is independent of the coupling strength and remains unchanged for a strongly coupled liquid .",
    "we restrict ourselves to conformal systems with massless degrees of freedom  generalizations to massive systems can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "using the relaxation - time approximation ( rta ) for the collision term , with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the local temperature , the boltzmann equation reads @xmath6.\\ ] ] we define @xmath7-moments of the distribution function weighted with some momentum observable @xmath8 by @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is a degeneracy factor ) . the ( baryon-)charge current and energy momentum tensor are then written as @xmath11 they take their ideal fluid dynamical form @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the spatial projector in the local rest frame ( lrf ) ) if we assume that the system is locally momentum isotropic : @xmath15 this ideal fluid decomposition does not require chemical equilibrium , nor does it require complete thermal equilibrium in the sense that the dependence of @xmath16 on its argument is exponential .",
    "if the dependence is non - exponential , the collision term in the boltzmann equation is non - zero , but its @xmath17-moment still vanishes , @xmath18 , due to energy - momentum conservation .",
    "the ideal hydrodynamic equations follow by inserting this ideal fluid decomposition into @xmath19 which one can solve for the local charge density @xmath20 , energy density @xmath21 , and flow velocity @xmath22 , with temperature @xmath23 , chemical potential @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 following from the equation of state ( eos ) of the fluid . local deviations from chemical equilibrium result in a non - equilibrium value of the local chemical potential and a non - zero right hand side in the charge conservation equation .",
    "deviations from thermal equilibrium ( while preserving local isotropy ) must be accounted for by a non - equilibrium pressure in the eos @xmath26 . in both cases",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) lead to a non - vanishing entropy production rate @xmath27 .",
    "israel - stewart ( is ) second - order viscous fluid dynamics @xcite is obtained by using in ( [ eq3 ] ) for @xmath28 the ansatz @xmath29 for later convenience we decompose @xmath17 into its temporal and spatial components in the lrf : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ". then @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the decomposition ( [ eq6 ] ) is made unique by landau matching : first , define the lrf by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath35 with the constraint @xmath36 .",
    "this fixes the flow vector @xmath22 and the lrf energy density .",
    "next , we fix @xmath23 and @xmath24 by demanding that @xmath37 gives no contribution to the local energy and baryon density : @xmath38 . inserting ( [ eq6 ] ) into ( [ eq3 ] ) we find the general decomposition @xmath39 with a non - zero charge flow @xmath40 in the lrf , a bulk viscous pressure @xmath41 , and a shear stress @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 indicates moments taken with the deviation @xmath37 from @xmath16 ) . in the last equation we introduced the notation @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , for the traceless and transverse ( to @xmath46 ) part of a tensor @xmath47 .",
    "the shear stress tensor @xmath48 has 5 independent components . altogether",
    ", the deviation @xmath37 has introduced 9 additional dissipative flow degrees of freedom .",
    "their corresponding 9 equations of motion are controlled by microscopic physics and can be derived from approximate solutions of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "anisotropic hydrodynamics @xcite is obtained from ( [ eq5 ] ) by using in ( [ eq3 ] ) the spheroidally deformed local momentum distribution @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 being a unit vector in @xmath52 direction in the lrf .",
    "this distribution is characterized by 3 flow parameters @xmath22 and three `` thermodynamic '' parameters : the `` transverse temperature '' @xmath53 , the effective chemical potential @xmath54 , and the momentum - anisotropy parameter @xmath55 . inserting ( [ eq8 ] ) into ( [ eq3 ] ) yields the ahydro decomposition @xmath56 for massless systems , the local momentum anisotropy effects factor out via the @xmath57-functions , given in @xcite .",
    "the isotropic pressure is obtained from a locally isotropic eos @xmath58 . for massless",
    "noninteracting partons , @xmath59 independent of chemical composition .",
    "to compare with ideal and is viscous hydrodynamics , we need to assign the locally anisotropic system an appropriate temperature @xmath60 and chemical potential @xmath61 , thinking of @xmath62 as an expansion around the locally isotropic distribution @xmath63 . for this",
    "we impose the generalized landau matching conditions @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "for example , using an exponential ( boltzmann ) function for @xmath16 with @xmath66 , one finds @xmath67 . with this matching",
    "we can write @xmath68 we see that @xmath69 has only one independent component , @xmath70 , so ahydro leaves 4 of the 5 components of @xmath1 unaccounted for . for massless particles we have @xmath71 ,",
    "so the equation of motion for @xmath69 can be replaced by one for @xmath72 .",
    "for @xmath73 we need an additional `` anisotropic eos '' for @xmath74 , in order to separate @xmath75 from the viscous bulk pressure @xmath76 .",
    "* 4 . * finally ,",
    "vahydro @xcite is obtained by generalizing the ansatz ( [ eq8 ] ) to include arbitrary ( but small ) corrections to the spheroidally deformed @xmath77 : @xmath78 the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 are landau - matched as before , _",
    "i.e. _ by requiring @xmath81 ; to fix the value of the deformation parameter @xmath72 we demand that @xmath82 does not contribute to the pressure anisotropy @xmath70 , which requires @xmath83 . then , upon inserting ( [ eq14 ] ) into ( [ eq3 ] ) , we obtain the vahydro decomposition @xmath84 subject to the constraints @xmath85 .",
    "clearly , the additional shear stress @xmath86 arising from @xmath37 has only 4 degrees of freedom . ",
    "the strategy in vahydro is now to solve hydrodynamic equations for ahydro ( which treat @xmath70 nonperturbatively ) with added viscous flows from @xmath87 , together with is - like `` perturbative '' equations of motion for @xmath88 , and @xmath86 .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are obtained by using the decomposition ( [ eq15 ] ) in the conservation laws ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "the evolution equations for the dissipative flows @xmath89 , and @xmath86 are derived by generalizing the procedure in @xcite to an expansion of the distribution function around the spheroidally deformed @xmath90 in ( [ eq8 ] ) , using the 14-moment approximation .",
    "the equations are lengthy and found in @xcite .",
    "we give their simplified form for ( 0 + 1)-d expansion in the next section . especially at early times",
    "@xmath87 is much smaller than @xmath37 , since the largest part of @xmath37 is already accounted for by the momentum deformation in ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the inverse reynolds number @xmath91 associated with the residual shear stress @xmath86 is therefore strongly reduced compared to that associated with @xmath1 , significantly improving the range of applicability of vahydro relative to standard second - order viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "for ( 0 + 1)-d longitudinally boost - invariant expansion of a transversally homogeneous system , the boltzmann equation can be solved exactly in rta @xcite , and the solution can be used to test the various macroscopic hydrodynamic approximation schemes . setting homogeneous initial conditions in @xmath92 and space - time rapidity @xmath93 and zero transverse flow , @xmath86 reduces to a single non - vanishing component @xmath94 : @xmath95 at @xmath96 .",
