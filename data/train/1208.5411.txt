    "in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , heavy quarks are , due to their large mass , mainly produced via initial hard parton scatterings .",
    "therefore , heavy - flavour particles are sensitive to the full evolution of the strongly - interacting partonic medium expected to be formed in the collisions @xcite . according to perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , the energy - loss of a parton in the medium depends on its colour charge and on the quark mass @xcite .",
    "the modifications of heavy - flavour particle momentum distributions in pb - pb collisions with respect to the ones in pp collisions represent a sensitive probe for the medium properties and the underlying mechanism of in medium parton energy loss .",
    "the measurement of heavy - flavour production in pp collisions provides a precision test of pqcd calculations and a crucial baseline for the interpretation of the results in pb - pb collisions .",
    "the nuclear modification factor , @xmath1 , is defined as @xmath2 = @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the average nuclear overlap function for a given collision centrality class , @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to the @xmath0-differential electron yield in nucleus - nucleus collisions and the @xmath0-differential cross section in pp collisions respectively .",
    "the alice experiment @xcite is the dedicated heavy - ion experiment at the lhc .",
    "the alice detector has electron identification capability down to very low @xmath0 at mid - rapidity which allows us to study heavy - flavours via their semi - electronic decays ( branching ratio @xmath7 10% ) .",
    "the central barrel detectors of alice have a very good spatial resolution to separate secondary vertices .",
    "thus , electrons produced from beauty decays can be separated from those originated from charm decays .",
    "tracks were reconstructed in the central rapidity region with the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the inner tracking system ( its ) .",
    "track momentum resolution is better than 4% for and the resolution of the transverse impact parameter d@xmath8 is better than 75 @xmath9 m for @xmath0 @xmath10 1 gev/@xmath11 @xcite . for the tracks which fulfill the track quality criteria ,",
    "electron selection cuts @xcite were applied using the signals in the tpc , the time - of - flight detector ( tof ) , the transition radiation detector ( trd ) and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) .",
    "tpc and tof were used for electron selection in pb - pb data . for pp data ,",
    "two different strategies were used .",
    "in addition to tpc , the first one employs the tof and the trd whereas the second one makes use of the emcal .",
    "tracks compatible with the electron hypothesis within 3 @xmath12 from the time of flight measured by the tof were selected , thus rejecting kaons up to a momentum of @xmath7 1.5 gev/@xmath11 and protons up to @xmath7 3 gev/@xmath11 . using charge deposited in the trd , the electron likelihood of a track was calculated .",
    "a momentum dependent cut was applied on the likelihood to have a constant electron efficiency of 80% , providing excellent separation of electrons from pions up to for pp collisions .",
    "alternatively , the ratio @xmath13 of the energy deposited in the emcal and the measured momentum was calculated , and tracks within 3 @xmath12 from the @xmath13 peak were selected .",
    "further hadron rejection was done by applying a cut on tpc specific energy deposit expressed as the distance to the expected energy deposit of electrons , normalized by the energy - loss resolution .",
    "the remaining hadron contamination , which is below 3 ( 10)% up to for pp ( pb - pb ) data , was calculated using a fit of the tpc d@xmath14/d@xmath15 in momentum slices and subtracted .",
    "the inclusive electron spectrum consists of background electrons from various sources in addition to the signal ( electrons from heavy - flavour decays ) .",
    "the main background electrons are originating from dalitz decays of light - neutral mesons and dielectron decays of light - vector mesons , and from the conversions of decay photons in the beam pipe and the innermost layer of the its .",
    "they were calculated based on alice measured @xmath16 and @xmath17 spectrum @xcite and @xmath18-scaled spectra for other light - flavour mesons using pythia @xcite decay kinematics .",
    "the background electrons from dielectron decays of heavy quarkonia were calculated based on measurements at the lhc @xcite , and those from real and virtual qcd photon decays were estimated based on next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd calculation @xcite . at high electron @xmath0 ,",
    "contributions from hard scattering processes are important and become dominant @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum of electrons from heavy - flavour decays was obtained by subtracting the background cocktail from the inclusive electron @xmath0 spectrum .    in pp collisions ,",
    "the measurement of the @xmath0-differential cross section of electrons from the beauty decays was done by applying an additional cut on the d@xmath8 of identified electron tracks @xcite .",
    "since the electrons from beauty decays have larger d@xmath8 compared to those of background electrons due to their large mean proper decay length a cut on the minimum d@xmath8 of the electron candidate tracks enhances the signal to background ratio .",
    "the remaining background electrons were estimated based on other alice measurements ( @xmath16 @xmath0 spectra @xcite and d - mesons @xmath0 spectra @xcite ) , and subtracted .",
    "after corrections for geometrical acceptance and efficiency , the electron yield from beauty decays per minimum bias collision was normalized using the cross section of minimum bias pp collisions .    alternatively , the relative beauty contribution to the heavy - flavour electron yields was measured based on characteristic azimuthal angular correlations of electrons from heavy - flavour decays and charged hadrons ( e - h ) .",
    "it was extracted by fitting the correlation distribution with monte carlo templates obtained using pythia @xcite .",

    "ratio of electrons from beauty decays to those from heavy - flavour decays measured via e - h correlations , compared to fonll calculations @xcite . ]",
    "the results were obtained from a sample of minimum bias pp collisions ( 2.6 @xmath20 for heavy - flavour decay electrons and 2.1 @xmath20 for beauty - decay electrons ) recorded in 2010 at @xmath19 = 7 tev and a sample of emcal triggered pp collisions ( @xmath21 events ) recorded in 2011 at @xmath19 = 2.76 tev .",
    "the @xmath0-differential invariant cross section of electrons from heavy - flavour decays is measured for @xmath0 above in the rapidity interval @xmath22 0.5 at @xmath19 = 7 tev ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "figure  [ fig2 ] presents the invariant production cross section of electrons from beauty decays in @xmath22 0.8 obtained with the analysis based on the d@xmath8 cut , and the calculated electron spectrum from charm decays at @xmath19 = 7 tev .",

    "was measured using e - h correlations at ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) . in all analyses , fixed - order plus next - to - leading log ( fonll ) calculations @xcite are in agreement with the measurements within uncertainties .",
    "the results were obtained from a sample of minimum bias pb - pb collisions ( @xmath21 events ) recorded in fall 2010 at @xmath24= 2.76 tev .",
    "the silicon pixel detector ( spd ) and the two scintillator hodoscopes ( v0 ) provide the minimum bias trigger , and events are classified according to their centrality based on percentiles of the distribution of the sum of the amplitudes in the v0 detectors @xcite .",
    "the inclusive electron spectra and background electron cocktails , calculated based on the charged pion spectra measured by alice , were obtained for six centrality classes .",

    "the @xmath0 dependence of the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 of background - subtracted electrons for the centrality ranges 0 - 10% and 60 - 80% in @xmath22 0.8 has been calculated with respect to pp reference spectra ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) . the reference cross section in pp collisions at @xmath19",
    "= 2.76 tev was obtained by applying a @xmath0-dependent scaling factor , calculated based on fonll predictions @xcite , to the cross section measured at a factor 1.5 - 4 suppression is observed for 3.5 @xmath25 6 gev/@xmath11 , where heavy - flavour decays are dominant .",
    "it suggests us a strong energy - loss of heavy quarks in the medium produced in central pb - pb collisions .",
