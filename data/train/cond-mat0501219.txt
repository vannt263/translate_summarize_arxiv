    "@xcite the metallic phase has been called ` floating ' , the long - time - correlated zero - dimensional systems on the grains ` float ' over each other .    in the present paper we build on our earlier work @xcite by explicitly calculating the important correlation functions in the floating phase . by carefully including all relevant and dangerously irrelevant variables ,",

    "thus , each grain constitutes a dynamic local system on its own , and they are only short - range - correlated in space .",
