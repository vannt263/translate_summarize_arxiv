    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this scale factor may vary with cosmic time which in turn gives rise to variations of fundamental constants in the 4d or extra - d space - time .",
    "very different time dependencies , from linear to slow - rolling to oscillating variations are considered in some theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such variations are now intensively searched for both in astrophysical observations and in laboratory experiments .",
    "so far , essentially all sensitive astrophysical experiments that probe variations of the fundamental constants at high redshift have used intervening absorbing systems towards qsos by comparing the redshifts of different lines .",
    "this holds for optical but also for mm and cm ( , oh ) absorption lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which typically give rise to narrow ( @xmath710  wide ) absorption features which in principle allow very precise estimates of the line centroids .",
    "a possible systematic frequency shift in these experiments can arise from the different velocity distributions of different species in the absorbing gas ( the so called doppler noise , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is due to the fact that absorption experiments only probe pencil beams through the interstellar medium ( ism ) of intervening galaxies which makes these experiments sensitive to the physical and chemical small scale structure of the ism .",
    "this effect can be largely reduced by using multiplets from a single species ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and large samples of absorbing systems that are now available in the optical / uv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ for absorption studies in the radio regime the analysis can be further complicated by the fact that the continuum source itself may have a frequency and/or time dependent structure ( e.g. synchrotron emission from compact radio jets ) and therefore absorption may trace different parts of the absorbing cloud .",
    "in addition such studies until today are limited to a few suitable objects which compromises statistical approaches . on the other hand radio and",
    "mm studies are particularly sensitive probes for variations of the fundamental constants as coupling strength of fine - structure or inversion transitions to variations in @xmath2 and/or @xmath3 is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of electronic transitions in the optical / uv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , it has been suggested to use low or mid ",
    "j rotational co lines in conjunction with fine structure lines of atomic carbon to search for variations of the fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the absorption studies , both lines can be seen in emission and therefore their line profiles probe the gas distribution and kinematics on galactic scales rather than random motion along a single line of sight . as such their line centroids will not depend on the small scale physical and chemical structure of the ism which makes both emission lines promising candidates to complement absorption line studies .",
    "this line combination is sensitive to variations of @xmath8 .",
    "variations of this quantity are related to the observed redshift of both lines via @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the redshift difference between the co and  lines . as such their sensitivity to @xmath2-variations is about 30 times higher than any uv line ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the downside of using emission lines is that the intrinsic line widths are large compared to the absorption lines which reduces the accuracy to determine the line centroids at the same signal  to  noise ratio .",
    "co and  observations of high - z galaxies are becoming available in increasing number ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these spectra , however , typically have low velocity resolution and low signal - to - noise and therefore can not be used to analyze the variations of the fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "furthermore most high - z galaxies detected in  so far have large line width ( @xmath11 ) which implies that even with high signal to noise observations it would be extremely challenging to study  as this would require redshift accuracies below 1 .    in this paper",
    "we present sensitive observations of the  and  transition ( co(76 ) and  hereafter ) in the high - z qso host galaxy  at redshift z=2.79 .",
    "is currently the most suitable candidate for high - precision co and  redshift measurements as it exhibits very strong line emission due to gravitational lensing and has the narrowest co line width ( fwhm=120 ) of any high  redshift source observed so far .",
    "furthermore the increased bandwidth of millimeter facilities implies that the redshifted co(76 ) and  lines can now be measured simultaneously in a single observational setup which eliminates efficiently potential instrumental systematics .",
    "measuring possible changes in the fundamental constants clearly requires very high signal  to  noise observations of the co and lines .",
    "such high quality observations have also the potential to reveal outflows , i.e. negative feedback from star formation and/or agn winds .",

    "the line wings detected in our spectra towards  are remarkably similar to those recently detected in deep co observations towards two local galaxies hosting an agn : mrk231 @xcite and ngc1266 @xcite . in both cases",
    "the co wings have been interpreted as molecular outflows .",
    "while the projected outflow velocities in ngc1266 are comparable to those detected in our spectra , the outflow signature in mrk231 is much more pronounced with wings detected out to @xmath48 .",
    "although it is tempting to interpret the line wings in  as the signatures of a molecular outflow the situation is complicated by the fact that the source is amplified by a galaxy ( visible in the hst - nicmos image shown in fig.[result_1 ] ) and only to a lesser degree by a nearby galaxy cluster ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the caustic curves are very compact , unlike the smoothly varying caustics from cluster lensing .",
    "thus an alternative interpretation is that the lens only strongly amplifies a small part of the molecular gas distribution in the disk of  ( with correspondingly narrow co line width ) and that the faint , broader co profile visible as wings is the true line width of the system with low or no lens magnification .",
    "we can , however , use the observed line luminosity of the optically thick co(76 ) line together with the excitation temperature of @xmath49k estimated from the  line ratio ( using the intensity of the lower carbon line from walter  2011 ) to obtain a lower limit for the size of the amplified emission region .",
    "this calculation uses @xmath50 @xcite and assumes @xmath51 . taking the magnification of @xmath30 into account",
    "this yields a source diameter of @xmath52kpc which is a lower limit to the true source size because 1 ) it assumes an area filling factor of the emission of unity , 2 ) a face  on geometry , and 3 ) the true excitation temperature of the co(76 ) line is likely lower than our estimate from  due to the higher critical density of the co(76 ) transition compared to both  lines .",
    "thus the true underlying source size is likely similar to what has been observed in resolved , unlensed high redshift qso host galaxies ( such as j1148 + 5251 with d=2.5kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "this comparison suggests that the gravitational lens amplifies the entire molecular gas distribution of  and not just a small fraction of the disk .",
    "this favors the interpretation that the narrow observed line width is due to a close to face  on orientation of the molecular disk and that the faint line wings indeed trace a molecular outflow .",
    "we estimate the molecular gas mass in the outflow using the optically thin  line ( see e.g. eq.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "we use the  excitation temperature given above and a carbon abundance , @xmath53/[\\hh]$ ] , of @xmath54 @xcite which yields a molecular gas mass ( including a correction of 1.36 for helium and correcting for the magnification ) of @xmath55 .",
    "this mass only includes the line wings ( difference between the two component and the single component fit shown in fig.[fig : lineshape ] right , albeit for ) and corresponds to @xmath56 of the  line luminosity .",
    "the total mass in the broad line component ( which has been used by feruglio  ( 2010 ) to estimate the outflow mass in mrk231 ) is @xmath57 .",
    "we here , however , use the more conservative approach to estimate the outflow properties only based on the mass in the line wings @xcite . using the hwhm=145  from the gaussian fit to the broad line component as a lower limit for the average outflow speed ( due to the unknown outflow orientation ) the kinetic energy in the outflow is @xmath58erg .",
    "thus the outflow in  is @xmath59 more massive but likely less energetic than the outflow in mrk231 while other key parameters ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) are comparable for both sources after correcting for the gravitational magnification .    for  the lack of information on the size and morphology of the outflow",
    "prevents us from estimating the dynamical time scale and the outflow rate . mapping the blue and the red line wings",
    "independently only yields an upper limit for their angular separation in the image plane of @xmath63 ( @xmath64kpc ) , not sufficient to obtain a meaningful limit on the outflow rate . if we assume that the outflow size is comparable to the outflows observed in mrk231 and ngc1266 ( r=0.5kpc ) the outflow rate for  is @xmath65yr@xmath13 , larger than the star formation rate ( sfr=140yr@xmath13 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which would hint at agn feedback as being the main driver for the molecular outflow ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the corresponding gas depletion time scale would be only 40myr . even if we use the observed upper limit of @xmath64kpc as the intrinsic radius for the outflow the depletion time scale remains short ( @xmath66myr ) which implies that a significant fraction ( @xmath67 ) of molecular gas will be removed from the disk within the typical lifetime of 100myr for massive starbursts at high redshift @xcite .",
    "a potential concern using mid - j co and  emission lines as a probe of variations of the fundamental constants is whether both lines trace the same gas on galactic scales",
    ". observations of co and  in the milky way have shown that both lines indeed probe the same molecular material on large and small scales @xcite despite the expectations from photon dominated region ( pdr ) models which predict that  should only exist in small layers surrounding the co cloud cores . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "our experiment probably probes a region of @xmath68kpc in diameter .",
    "we would therefore expect that any potential spatial differences in the co and  emission velocities within molecular clouds would average out to zero over these extended regions .    given that both lines trace the same volume on large scales",
    "one would naively expect that their line profiles are identical .",
    "our observations show that this is not the case and that the  line profile is @xmath69% narrower than the co profile ( fig.[fig : lineshape ] left & center ; table[tab : fit ] ) .",
    "this effect , however , is expected as the opacity of co is typically much larger than the opacity ( for the peak of the lines in  we estimate opacities of 17 and 1.0 for co(76 ) and respectively using large velocity gradient models ) . since the gas column density and therefore the opacity decreases towards the wings of the lines and because the intensity in each velocity bin scales as @xmath70 , the intensity in the wings of the  line decreases more rapidly than in the case of co which in turn gives rise to a narrower line profile in .",
    "this effect , however , is not expected to be a critical limitation for the precise determination of the line centroid ( i.e. the systemic velocity or redshift of the galaxy ) : the line profiles of galaxy - averaged molecular emission lines are not only determined by opacity and excitation effects but also by the effective source solid angle as a function of velocity .",
    "the latter typically does not saturate ( i.e. clouds do not overlap in velocity space and spatially at the same time ) which prevents galaxy - averaged co lines from saturating at their peak . as systematic instrumental effects ( e.g. lsr corrections )",
    "cancel out in our simultaneous observations of both lines and local oscillator variations ( defining the frequency accuracy of the spectrometer ) can safely be neglected , we conclude that systematic uncertainties are small compared with the statistical uncertainties , i.e. our ability to determine variations of the fundamental constants is solely limited by the signal to noise ratio and line width of our spectrum .",
    "so far estimates on the variations of the fundamental constants using high redshift emission lines have only been published in two studies using  and co ( in br1202 - 0725 at z=4.7 and j1148 + 5251 at z=6.4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and  and co ( in a sample of sources at z=2.34.1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the measurements were taken entirely from the literature .",
    "these attempts yielded 3@xmath71 limits on  of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "our experiment improves on these limits by more than a factor of 20 ( at comparable lookback time ) with @xmath74 .",
    "most absorption line studies have focused on variations in  or .",
    "variations of  are related to both these quantities via = 2@xmath75  @xcite .",

    "this combination provides a particularly sensitive probe to  due to the strong coupling between their redshift difference and variations in @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "studies using several inversion and rotational transitions toward pks1810 - 211 at @xmath77 give a conservative limit of @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the formally most accurate application of this technique to date yields a 3@xmath71 limit of @xmath79 at @xmath80 @xcite albeit on a small number of spectral lines .",
    "limits on variations of @xmath2 at high redshift do not reach such accuracy to date but some studies have reported non - zero values for  based on qso absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "we here use our results to obtain an independent limit on . if we assume = 0 between z=0 and z=2.79 ( motivated by the nh@xmath76 results mentioned above ) our observations yield @xmath81 , consistent with zero variations of @xmath2 at a lookback time of 11.3gyr within the uncertainties ( @xmath82 ) . as such our experiment yields comparable accuracy on a single object as work based on hires / keck and uves / vlt absorption line spectroscopy on qso samples which give typical accuracies of 1 - 2ppm ( 1@xmath71 , * ? ? ?",

    "our source , , lies nearly orthogonal to the proposed angular dipole distribution of webb  ( 2011 ) and king  ( 2012 ) and thus does not provide a stringent test of that claim .",
    "our observations demonstrate that sensitive simultaneous millimeter wave observations of co(76 ) and  emission lines provide a powerful diagnostic to investigate possible variations of the fundamental constants at high redshift .",
    "our observations do not show evidence that systematic effects are limiting the interpretation of the data and our results are limited by the signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra .",

    "a potential concern of deep and more precise observations could arise from the different optical depth in the co and  lines which leads to slightly different line shapes for both transitions .",
    "such potential limitations can be eliminated by observations of reasonably sized samples of high - z co and  emitters with suitable line widths . given alma s sensitivity even co isotopologues such as @xmath83co will eventually become accessible with high signal  to  noise ratio which will further help to remove this potential limitation . in any case",
    "the uncertainties and potential systematics of emission line studies will be substantially different from those of absorption line experiments .",
    "as such the combination of both approaches on samples of high - z galaxies will greatly improve the sensitivity and reliability of measurements probing the variations of the fundamental constants .",

    "<S> our observations show that the  and co line shapes are in good agreement with each other but that the  line profile is of order 10% narrower , presumably due to the lower opacity in the latter line . </S>",
    "<S> both lines show faint wings with velocities up to @xmath0 , indicative of a molecular outflow . </S>",
    "<S> as such the data provide direct evidence for negative feedback in the molecular gas phase at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> our observations allow us to determine the observed frequencies of both transitions with so far unmatched accuracy at high redshift . </S>",

    "<S> we find @xmath4 at a lookback time of 11.3gyr , which within the uncertainties , is consistent with no variations of the fundamental constants . </S>"
