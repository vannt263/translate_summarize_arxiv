    "therefore there are many methods to calculate its values @xcite , for example : ( i ) the wkb approximation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; ( ii ) the phase integral method @xcite-@xcite ; ( iii ) to substitute the effective potential which appears in the schrdinger type equation with an exactly solvable potential @xcite ; ( iv ) the use of continued fractions @xcite-@xcite ; ( v ) the monodromy method @xcite ( see below ) .",
