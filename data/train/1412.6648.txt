    "<S> we investigate the propagation of light beams including hermite - gauss , bessel - gauss and finite energy airy beams in a linear medium with parabolic potential . </S>",
    "<S> expectedly , the beams undergo oscillation during propagation , but quite unexpectedly they also perform automatic fourier transform , that is , periodic change from the beam to its fourier transform and back . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillating period of parity - asymmetric beams is twice that of the parity - symmetric beams . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to oscillation , the finite - energy airy beams exhibit periodic inversion during propagation . </S>",
    "<S> based on the propagation in parabolic potential , we introduce a class of optically - interesting beams that are self - fourier beams  that is , the beams whose fourier transforms are the beams themselves . </S>"
