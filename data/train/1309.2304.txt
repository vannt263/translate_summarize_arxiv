    "the connection between information theory and algebraic geometry , once unthinkable , was established by the rise of applications like goppa codes @xcite and elliptic and hyperelliptic curve cryptography @xcite .",
    "both coding and cryptography are branches of information theory as originally formulated by shannon @xcite .",
    "a _ message _ is a sequence of symbols from a known alphabet with known probabilities ( to be concrete , imagine a stream of bits selected from @xmath4 with known probability of choosing each ) .",
    "the information content of such a message is the smallest number of bits required to send it ; this is related to its kolmogorov complexity . in coding",
    ", the goal is to adjoin bits , that is , redundancy , to make the message more likely to understand ; in cryptography , one of the goals is to hide redundancy .",
    "goppa codes are constructed from the line bundles and points of an algebraic curve defined over a finite field ; the field elements constitute the alphabet .",
    "the parameters of the code are determined using the riemann ",
    "roch theorem .",
    "the most common cryptographic constructions use the jacobian of an algebraic curve , most often an elliptic or hyperelliptic curve ; the cryptographic strength comes from the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem in these groups .",
    "one generally discusses cryptographic protocols using a sender alyce sending a message to a receiver bob that may be intercepted by an eavesdropper eve .",
    "now suppose that alyce wants to describe a compact riemann surface with genus @xmath1 to bob . by torelli",
    "s theorem she can , in principle , send bob a period matrix of the curve ( although in practice it can be difficult to tell much about the curve from its period matrix ) .",
    "this message consists of @xmath2 complex numbers , or their approximations .",
    "however , the dimension of the moduli space of compact riemann surfaces of genus @xmath1 is only @xmath3 , so in principle , or locally , the information content of alyce s message is much smaller than its length .    in the language of information theory , then , the message is _",
    "compressible_. this concept is familiar to computer users who use utilities like gzip to compress files and save disk space .",
    "another perspective on this situation is that the message describing the riemann surface is _ sparse _ , or approximately so . to illustrate what sparsity means in this context , imagine some finite energy signal ( say , a voice reading aloud ) and its fourier transform . in many cases drawn from nature ( see @xcite ) the set of coefficients of this expansion ( or other expansion , such as wavelets , or even non - orthonormal expansions @xcite ) contains only a few large numbers , while the rest of the coefficients are zero or small ; this is the meaning of sparse in this context .",
    "put differently , the spectrum of the signal is concentrated in a few bands .",
    "the essence of many compression and de  noising schemes is to look at the spectrum of a signal and approximate it using only the terms with large coefficients . _",
    "compressed sensing _",
    "@xcite takes a completely different approach ; rather than collecting the whole signal before compressing , compressed sensing collects a smaller number of samples , in effect compressing at the source .",
    "one way to do this might be take a random set of fourier coefficients .",
    "for example , given @xmath5 , the discrete fourier transform of some signal , let @xmath6 be a _ random _ @xmath7 matrix with entries in @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 ; @xmath10 is the observation . in theory ,",
    "the problem of reconstructing @xmath5 from @xmath10 is not well  defined , but in practice when the signal is sparse excellent approximations and even exact reconstructions are possible .",
    "it seems natural that at least the ideas of compressed sensing might apply to alyce s description of a riemann surface .",
    "furthermore , when eve hears alyce s list of @xmath2 complex numbers , it is natural for her to ask whether they are the periods of a compact riemann surface .",
    "this is just a restatement of the classical schottky problem , asking how to distinguish period matrices from ordinary elements of the siegel upper half space .",
    "call this version the _ information  theoretic schottky problem_.    eve might also wonder about the properties of the riemann surface represented by alyce s message ; for example , she might ask whether the surface in question is hyperelliptic , or trigonal , or whether it has a non - trivial automorphism group , _ etc . _ call this the _ information  theoretic torelli problem_. in this case , numerical results @xcite ( and unpublished analytical results ) indicate that one can distinguish the period matrices of hyperelliptic surfaces among arbitrary period matrices by examining the _ statistics _ of the periods : the periods are _ band  limited _ in the sense that their frequencies ( arguments ) are tightly clustered .",
    "begin by fixing notation ; consult @xcite as a general reference .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact riemann surface of genus @xmath1 ; equivalently , @xmath0 is a nonsingular complex algebraic curve .",
    "choose a basis @xmath11 for the space @xmath12 of holomorphic differentials on @xmath0 , and a symplectic basis @xmath13 for the singular homology @xmath14 , normalized so @xmath15 , the dirac delta .",
    "the matrix @xmath16 is the _ period matrix _ ; riemann proved that it is symmetric with positive definite imaginary part .",
    "the torus @xmath17 $ ] is the _",
    "jacobian _ of @xmath0 .",
    "torelli s theorem asserts that the jacobian determines all of the properties of @xmath0 . in practice",
    "deciding which properties apply is seldom successful , and any success ( like @xcite ) depends on deep tools like riemann s theta  function .",
    "the period matrix is symmetric with positive - definite imaginary part , and the space of such matrices forms the _ siegel upper half - space _ @xmath18 .",
    "its dimension is @xmath2 , while the dimension of the moduli space of curves of degree @xmath19 is @xmath3 .",
    "distinguishing the period matrices from arbitrary elements of @xmath18 is the _",
    "schottky problem_.    it would be unusual  and noteworthy  were a problem as old as the schottky problem to remain unsolved .",
    "survey @xcite contains more detail , but previous solutions have involved @xmath20function identities , the geometry of the @xmath21 divisor , kummer varieties , and solitons ; the wide range of techniques indicates that the schottky problem is a central problem in mathematics .",
    "the information - theoretic approach deepens this idea .",
    "the aim now is to study and then exploit the information - theoretic properties of period matrices .",
    "one interpretation of torelli s theorem is that the period matrix is a _ message _ or _ signal _ about @xmath0 .",
    "this message is highly compressible , while a random element of @xmath18 is not .",
    "the result here can also be interpreted as a new result in compressed sensing ( described below ) . typically , compressed sensing works with a _ linear _ relationship between the signal and the measurement , but in the schottky problem the relationship between the signal  that , is",
    ", the period matrix  and the measurement  that is , explicit moduli  is nonlinear .",
    "nonetheless , a compressed sensing manipulation of a _ precursor _ to the signal ( here , the holomorphic differentials ) still leads to a compressed sensing result , at least with high probability .",
    "nonlinear compressed sensing is an emerging field ; the few results to appear so far include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ compressed _ ( or _ compressive ) _ _ sensing _ @xcite is the study of taking small representations or samples of sparse ( or nearly sparse ) signals without any loss of information",
    ". a familiar example of compression is the joint photographic experts group ( jpeg ) standard for storing and transmitting images , which can encode an image comprising millions of pixels into a few kilobytes with minimal loss of quality .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , in compressed sensing the compression happens at the sensor rather than in post - processing .  sparse \"",
    "has many meanings ; one of the simpler ones is that the signal can be constructed from some basis ( _ e.g. _ , fourier series , impulses , wavelets , @xmath22 ) with only a few non  zero coefficients .",
    "many compression methods have the following outline : transform the signal with respect to some basis functions @xmath23 , remove most of the  unimportant \" terms ( _ eg _ , those with the smallest coefficients ) , and finally perform the inverse transform .",
    "for example one can do this with fourier coefficients , and the shannon - nyquist sampling theorem @xcite determines which coefficients one needs to retain for perfect or _ lossless _ compression .",
    "the same general outline applies to wavelets or other basis functions ( which need not be orthonormal ) .",
    "another concept of sparsity is  lying on a submanifold ( or subvariety ) of small dimension . \"",
    "@xcite discusses other definitions .",
    "abstractly , this corresponds to a signal vector @xmath24 and a linear set of observations @xmath25 formed using a _ sensing matrix _ @xmath26 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath27 in many applications it suffices to use a _ random _ matrix @xmath26 in which each entry is the result of a bernoulli process of fixed probability @xcite .",
    "compression works when the signal under consideration is sparse , or approximately so .",
    "this is the case with a period matrix , which , by torelli s theorem , represents a compact riemann surface completely : while the matrix has @xmath2 distinct entries , the riemann surface it encodes depends on @xmath3 moduli .    in this work ,",
    "the period matrix is treated as a signal @xmath28 of length @xmath2 which depends on @xmath3 unknown underlying parameters .",
    "this is a list of complex numbers ; the matrix structure is in some sense irrelevant becase their placement in the matrix depends on choices of bases for @xmath29 and @xmath30 . instead of multiplying @xmath28 by a random measurement matrix , as would be done in compressed sensing ,",
    "a random change  of  basis is applied to @xmath29 . with high probability ,",
    "the first three rows of the period matrix constructed from the new basis constitute a set of moduli for @xmath0 , in a sense explained below .",
    "the primary tool relating period matrices to moduli is the following theorem of rauch @xcite .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the canonical divisor on @xmath0 .",
    "[ thm - rauch ] [ rauch ] let @xmath32 be a normalized basis for @xmath33 of a non - hyperelliptic riemann surface @xmath0 , and suppose that @xmath34 form a basis for the quadratic differentials @xmath35",
    ". if another riemann surface @xmath36 has the same entries as @xmath0 in the @xmath37 positions of its period matrix then @xmath0 and @xmath36 are holomorphically equivalent .",
    "in other words , some sets of @xmath3 periods form local coordinates on the moduli space of compact riemann surfaces . however , except in special cases like smooth plane curves ( see @xcite ) , there are no results indicating _ which _ sets of @xmath3 entries constitute moduli .",
    "( in the case of plane curves , one can use the explicit basis for @xmath29 to determine sets of moduli . )",
    "numerical experiments with period matrices of large genus show that the distribution of the squared absolute values of the periods is consistent with a compressible signal .",
    "these distributions appear to follow a power law ( the @xmath38 entry is bounded by @xmath39 for some power @xmath40 ) .",
    "for example , consider the periods of the fermat curve of degree 11 , given in homogeneous by @xmath41",
    ". using maple , the squared moduli of the periods show the characteristic shape of a compressible signal .",
    "other numerical experiments have exhibited unusual phenomena in the distribution of the periods of special clases of curves ; in particular , the periods of hyperelliptic curves appear to be  band  limited \" .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this work takes a probabilistic approach to the problem of determining which sets of @xmath3 entries form moduli .",
    "the theorem of rauch above reduces this to finding a set of @xmath3 quadratic differentials that form a basis of @xmath42 .",
    "[ thm - main ] let @xmath0 be a compact riemann surface of genus @xmath19 and choose a symplectic homology basis for @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath26 be a @xmath43 matrix whose entries lie in @xmath44 , and are determined independently by a bernoulli process .",
    "use @xmath26 as a change - of - basis matrix for @xmath29 .",
    "then after the change  of  basis the first three rows of the period matrix for @xmath0 form moduli for @xmath0 , with high probability .    using the notation from theorem [ thm - rauch ] ,",
    "let @xmath32 be a normalized basis for @xmath33 and suppose that @xmath34 form a basis for @xmath42 .",
    "the elements of @xmath37 are unknown .",
    "now , let @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a random binary determined by a bernoulli process .",
    "determining the probability that @xmath47 forms a basis , which is the probability that the matrix @xmath48 $ ] is nonsingular , is rather subtle . tao and vu @xcite ,",
    "conjecture the probability to be @xmath49 and prove it greater than @xmath50 in any case , it is very likely that @xmath51 forms a basis for @xmath29 .",
    "now , assuming that @xmath51 forms a basis for @xmath29 , the question becomes determining the probability that @xmath52 forms a basis for @xmath42 .",
    "notice that this set contains @xmath3 elements because of the symmetry of the period matrix .",
    "again , because the coefficients are binary , and , in particular , positive , it suffices for each @xmath53 for @xmath54 to have a non - zero coefficient in one expansion of the products of the @xmath55s .    to find the probability that every coefficient of @xmath53 vanishes in the expansion of @xmath56 , notice that all four coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and@xmath60 must vanish , so the probability is @xmath61 .",
    "for this to happen for all coefficients , then , the probability is @xmath62 and , since this must happen independently for all @xmath53 , the probability of a basis for @xmath42 is @xmath63",
    "the proof of the main theorem is deceptively simple , because it depends on rauch s deep theorem .",
    "compressed sensing usually depends on _ linear _ measurement , and there are few results about nonlinear measurement processes @xcite . here , the  measurement \" is linear at the level of the holomorphic differentials , but the resulting transformation of the period matrix is non  linear .    a direct relationship between the moduli space of compact riemann surfaces and the period matrix is a long  standing difficult problem .",
    "one possibility here is to look at a discrete version of rauch s theorem , whose main construction is the minimal energy element of the homotopy class of differentiable maps between compact riemann surfaces .    in practice ,",
    "as d.  litt pointed out in a conversation , it may not be possible to transmit periods in a finite message , although many complex numbers do have compact descriptions ( _ eg _ , gaussian rationals , surds ) .",
    "in other cases it may only be possible to transmit an approximation of the periods , in which case the conclusion is that the curve in question is close ( in an analytic sense ) to the schottky locus , which is already significant ."
