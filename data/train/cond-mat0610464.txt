    "the systematic studies in la@xmath4mno@xmath1 show that the structural , electronic transport and magnetic properties strongly depend on @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . the maximum la deficiency in the single phase perovskite has been noticed in la@xmath0mno@xmath1 , where physical properties are found to be highly sensitive to @xmath8 . in case of most reduced sample a paramagnetic to orbitally ordered antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition is observed like stoichiometric lamno@xmath9 , where the orthorhombic phase is noticed at room temperature . the gradual transition from orbitally ordered orthorhombic to orbitally disorder ferromagnetic",

    "is observed at room temperature , where the dynamic orbital correlations favour fm state .",
    "recently , the examples of metastabilities in the self doped manganites have been reported based on low - field dc and ac susceptibility measurements , which are mainly suggested due to the domain wall dynamics in the system @xcite .",
    "because of the interplay among transport , magnetic , orbital , and structural degrees of freedom , the self hole doped manganites attracts considerable attention , which has not yet focused widely like hole doped and charge ordered ( co ) manganites .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the magnetic and electrical transport properties of la@xmath0mno@xmath1 under different conditions of applied magnetic field and thermal cycling .",
    "the results exhibit the evidence of meatstable states over a wide temperature range , which is found even at much higher temperature than the paramagnetic ( pm ) to fm and metal to insulator ( mi ) transitions .",
    "the metastabilities in the magnetotransport behaviour are found to be strongly influenced by the structurally driven inhomogeneous phase separation ( ps ) and domain wall dynamics in the fm ordered state .",
    "in addition , an interesting feature of memory effect is observed over a limited temperature range in the dynamics of resistivity for the orthorhombically distorted oxygen deficient compound .",
    "the polycrystalline sample with nominal composition la@xmath0mno@xmath1 was prepared by a chemical route as described in the literature @xcite .",
    "the final heat treatment was performed at 1200@xmath10c for 12 h in air , where the samples were cooled down to room temperature by furnace cooling .",
    "a portion of the sample annealed in air was further annealed in presence of oxygen at 1000@xmath10c for @xmath11 6 h. single phase of the sample was characterized by an x - ray diffractometer ( seifert xrd 3000p ) using cuk@xmath12 radiation .",
    "the powder x - ray diffraction analysis confirms the single phase of the compound , which could be indexed by the orthorhombic structure ( @xmath13 ) . in accordance with the reported results the crystal structure of the oxygen annealed sample",
    "was indexed by the monoclinic structure ( @xmath142/@xmath15 ) @xcite . for the simplicity ,",
    "we address the oxygen annealed sample as la@xmath0mno@xmath1(o@xmath16 ) .",
    "the magnetoresistance ( mr ) was measured by the standard four - probe technique , fitted with an electromagnet and a commercial closed cycle refrigerator operating down to 10 k ( janis research inc . ) .",
    "the magnetization ( @xmath17 ) was measured using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer ( mpms , xl ) . in zero - field",
    "cooled ( zfc ) measurements of @xmath18 and @xmath17 , the sample was cooled down to the desired temperature at zero magnetic field and the measurements were performed in the heating cycle just after the application of applied magnetic field . for the field - cooled ( fc ) condition , the sample was cooled down to the desired temperature with magnetic field and the measurements were performed while heating .",
    "temperature dependence of @xmath17 measured at 1 koe is shown in the top panel of figure 1 , indicating a pm to fm transition ( @xmath2 ) at 130 k , which was obtained from the minimum of @xmath19 against @xmath20 plot .",
    "the transition is not sharp like a typical pm to fm transition , which is rather spread over a wide temperature region . at low temperature",
    "the magnetization indicates a decreasing trend with a broad peak around 15 k , while the zfc magnetization ( @xmath21 ) deviates from the fc magnetization ( @xmath22 ) around @xmath23 85 k. the inset of the top panel of figure 1 exhibits the magnetization curve at 5 k , which does not saturate even at 50 koe .",
    "the value of moment at 50 koe is found to be 2.77 @xmath24/mn , which is less than that of the effective moment , @xmath25 = 5.91 @xmath24/mn , obtained from the linearity of the inverse susceptibility with paramagnetic curie temperature , @xmath26 @xmath11 200 k. note that the value of @xmath25 is much larger than the spin - only value for s = 2 , @xmath27 = 4.90 @xmath24 , suggesting the existence of fm clusters in accordance with the reported results @xcite .",
    "the inverse susceptibility deviates from the curie - weiss behaviour around @xmath23 240 k , which is much higher than @xmath2 as seen in the bottom panel of figure 1 .",
    "the orthorhombic crystal structure at room temperature and the value of moment at 50 koe and 5 k suggest the oxygen stoichiometry , @xmath28 2.87 in consistent with the reported results @xcite .",
    "we also measured the temperature variation of @xmath17 at low dc magnetic field , which is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath17 at 30 and 40 oe exhibits different characteristic features compared to the measurement at 1 koe . in the inset of figure 2 , the strong zfc - fc effect of magnetization is shown measured at 30 oe .",
    "the @xmath22 curve surprisingly deviates from the @xmath21 around @xmath23 230 k , which is consistent with the deviation of the inverse susceptibility around same temperature region from the curie - weiss law . in case of low field measurement @xmath2 obtained from the minimum of the @xmath19 against @xmath20 plot",
    "was found to be close to the high field measurements .",
    "the external magnetic field does not practically change the phase transition at @xmath2 .",
    "a peak in the @xmath21 ( @xmath29 ) is noticed around 97 and 90 k for the magnetic field at 30 and 40 oe , respectively , indicating that @xmath29 shifts toward the low temperature with increasing magnetic field .",
    "in addition to @xmath29 , an anomaly ( @xmath30 ) is noticed in @xmath21 around @xmath23 65 and @xmath23 48 k for 40 and 30 oe , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the field dependence of @xmath29 , @xmath30 is shifted toward the higher temperature with magnetic field .",
    "note that similar results were also reported in @xmath21 , where the anomaly in the @xmath21 was in fact , suggested due to the domain wall pinning effects @xcite .",
    "temperature dependence of @xmath18 for la@xmath0mno@xmath1 is shown in the top panel of figure 3 , which was measured in zero magnetic field and 2 koe magnetic field under both zfc and fc conditions .",
    "temperature dependence of @xmath18 in zero field exhibits a peak at around 144 k ( @xmath3 ) , which is found to be much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "the nature of the broadened peak at 144 k looks different in contrast to the sharp peak at the temperature of metal - insulator transition for hole doped compounds . in between 35 k and 153 k",
    "the typical metallic behaviour ( @xmath31 ) is noticed .",
    "the small increase of @xmath18 is clearly observed with a minimum in @xmath18 at 35 k , which is more pronounced in the temperature dependence of low - field mr .",
    "the effect of grain boundary contribution to the @xmath18 might have dominant role to the low - field mr for the polycrystalline sample .",
    "the effect of mr is noticed below @xmath23 230 k , while the maximum of mr is observed near @xmath2 , as seen in figure 3 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 3 shows the plot of @xmath32/@xmath33 against @xmath20 in the selected temperature region under different conditions of applied magnetic field .",
    "an anomaly is consistently noticed around 56 k in zero magnetic field , which does not change noticeably under zfc condition .",
    "the anomaly is slightly shifted to 55 k under fc condition in accordance with the effect of external magnetic field dependence of @xmath30 observed in the low - field magnetization study ( figure 2 ) .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the present resistivity result is sensitive to the effect of domain wall movement even at zero magnetic field , if we believe the anomaly noticed in the magnetization study is ascribed to the effect of domain wall pinning @xcite .",
    "the bifurcation of zfc and fc resistivities is clearly observed below @xmath23 190 k ( top panel of figure 3 ) , which is noticed at much higher than @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the values of @xmath3 are found to be 149 and 153 k under zfc and fc conditions , respectively .",
    "the bifurcation of zfc and fc data has commonly been found in the temperature dependence of @xmath17 , either due to metastability from the glassy component or from domain wall pinning @xcite .",
    "the evidence of zfc - fc effect in @xmath18 is rather , a rare example among transition metal oxides , which has recently been reported even in few manganites @xcite .",
    "a strong zfc - fc effect in @xmath18 was observed in the phase separated ( la@xmath34gd@xmath35)@xmath36sr@xmath37mn@xmath16o@xmath38 below spin glass ( sg ) temperature ( @xmath39 ) , where glassy behaviour was ascribed to the competing magnetic interactions between fm and afm states @xcite .",
    "the other example of zfc - fc effect in @xmath18 was observed in co compounds , where the co state was destroyed by the application of strong magnetic field , resulting in the different @xmath20 dependence between fc and zfc resistivities below the charge ordering temperature ( @xmath40 ) @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the origin of fc effect in @xmath18 is different from the above cases rather , it shows another kind of example of fc effect in @xmath18 in the orthorhombically distorted the self doped manganites . in order to understand the origin",
    ", we incorporated the above experimental protocol for la@xmath0mno@xmath1(o@xmath16 ) as seen in figure 4 .",
    "in contrast to the oxygen deficient sample , the bifurcation between zfc and fc resistivities disappears . in place of broadened peak for oxygen deficient sample a sharp peak",
    "is observed at 260 k in association with a broad hump around 240 k. the features of the temperature dependence is similar to the reported results @xcite , though the sharp peak in the present observation is 10 k larger than the sample with @xmath8 = 2.95 .",
    "the temperature dependence of [ @xmath18(0 ) - @xmath18(2 koe ) ] clealy indicate a sharp peak at 258 k , where @xmath2 is expected , indicating @xmath8 @xmath41 2.96 for la@xmath0mno@xmath1(o@xmath16 ) .    the weak thermal hysteresis in @xmath18 was strikingly observed in the metallic temperature region , when the measurement was performed in presence of magnetic field of 2 koe under fc condition as seen in figure 5 .",
    "the above scheme of measurements was performed both in absence and presence of magnetic field .",
    "the thermal hysteresis in @xmath18 was not observed in zero magnetic field .",
    "the irreversibility between cooling and heating curves starts around @xmath23 155 k , which is well above @xmath42 and @xmath3 , and they join up around @xmath23 55 k , where anomaly in the @xmath43 was noticed [ bottom panel of figure 3 ] under fc condition .",
    "we performed several successive cycles of heating and cooling under the fc condition and the observed that thermal hysteresis was reproducible .",
    "since , the measurements are performed using an electromagnet , the question of experimental artifact due to persistent current in the superconducting magnet can be ruled out .",
    "note that troyanchuk _",
    "@xcite suggested the probability of first order phase transition at @xmath2 , which was indicated indirectly by the analysis of magnetization curves around @xmath2 for the monoclinic phase of oxygen rich samples .",
    "we measured the resistivity for monoclinic la@xmath0mno@xmath1(o@xmath16 ) under fc condition both in the heating and cooling cycles , which does not show any thermal hysteresis .",
    "however , the thermal hysteresis of resistivity was clearly noticed for the monoclinic la@xmath0mn@xmath44fe@xmath45o@xmath1 under fc condition .",
    "since , the ionic radii of fe@xmath5 and mn@xmath5 are same , the inhomogeneity in the lattice is introduced by the random substitution of fe@xmath5 , which might be responsible for the thermal irreversibility in the resistivity under fc condition .",
    "note that the existence of thermal hysteresis of @xmath17 as well as in @xmath18 were noticed for co manganites , indicating the first order transition below @xmath40 , which have been observed even in absence of magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mixed valent manganites and cobalites , the existence of thermal hysteresis in @xmath18 and @xmath17 , indicating the first order phase transition have also been noticed in the intermetallics @xcite .",
    "we measured the mr by varying low magnetic field , which is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the low - field mr curves were measured at selected temperatures under zfc and fc conditions as shown in top panel of figure 6 .",
    "the non - linearity of the mr curves were noticed at 10 , 55 , 100 and 150 k , where non - linearity decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "similar to the temperature dependent behaviour , the large difference between mr curves is clearly noticed under zfc and fc conditions at 10 k , while the difference decreases at 55 k. at 100 and 150 k , the difference between zfc and fc mr curves was not distinguishable .",
    "the values of mr , defined as [ @xmath46 - @xmath47/@xmath46 , are @xmath23 23 , 22 , 19 and 22 % at 5 koe for 150 , 100 , 55 and 10 k , respectively under zfc condition , where @xmath46 and @xmath48 are the resistivities in zero field and field .",
    "we did not observe any significant change of magnetization curves in the increasing and decreasing cycles of magnetic field at 100 and 150 k under zfc and fc conditions .",
    "however , a clear evidence of hysteresis in the increasing and decreasing cycles was observed at 55 k under zfc condition , which enhances considerably at 10 k as seen in bottom panel of figure 6 .",
    "note that sankar et al .",
    "@xcite also reported the considerable increase of coercivity from the hysteresis of magnetization below @xmath30 . here",
    ", the anomaly in @xmath32/@xmath33 is observed around 55 k , where the hysteresis in mr curves are noticed for t @xmath49 55 k in consistent with the magnetization results .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath18 was measured under different conditions .",
    "we found that the values of @xmath18 do not change with time in absence of external magnetic field in all the measured temperature range .",
    "an interesting scenario in the relaxation of @xmath18 was surprisingly observed only at a very limited temperature region .",
    "the sample was first cooled down to 55 k under fc condition with 2 koe magnetic field from room temperature , waited for @xmath50 = 1 h and 1.5 h and then @xmath18 was measured with time just after switching off the field .",
    "the striking evidence of the sharp change of @xmath18 at @xmath50 in the relaxation of @xmath18 is found , as seen in figure 7 .",
    "the relaxation path for @xmath50 = 1 h does not follow the relaxation path for @xmath50 = 1.5 h. the above features are similar to the aging in @xmath17 , which have been commonly observed for sg compound , indicating the cooperative relaxation processes .",
    "in addition , the aging effect in @xmath17 is commonly observed below @xmath39 , where the relaxation rate of magnetization , @xmath51 = 1/@xmath52(@xmath53/@xmath54ln@xmath55 ) , is found to be maximum around , @xmath55 = @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the evidence of such effect in @xmath18 is rather , a rare example even in mixed valent manganites .",
    "recently , the sharp change in @xmath18 at @xmath50 was also reported by wu _",
    "et al_. in cobalite , where the origin of such unusual features was not explained @xcite . in accordance with this results , the sharp change in @xmath18 is directly observed in the @xmath18 _ vs. _ @xmath55 plot at @xmath55 = @xmath50 , not in the relaxation rate of @xmath18 .",
    "note that the relaxation of @xmath18 was noticed only in the limited temperature region around anomaly in @xmath32/@xmath33 [ bottom panel of figure 3 ] , where the relaxation in magnetization was also reported by sankar _",
    ", suggesting the effect of domain wall dynamics @xcite .",
    "we also measured the time dependence of @xmath18 for la@xmath0mno@xmath1(o@xmath16 ) both in presence and absence magnetic field at different temperatures , which do not show any noticeable time dependence in @xmath18 .",
    "the influence of domain wall dynamics has been reported in different manganites mainly based on the low - field magnetization studies .",
    "the evidence of domain wall dynamics has also been reported in la@xmath56mno@xmath9 , which was characterised by the temperature dependence and relaxation studies of dc and ac susceptibilities @xcite .",
    "the influence of domain wall dynamics on @xmath18 has also the significant role in different fm materials viz . , epitaxial thin film @xcite , ( ga , mn)as @xcite , nanocotacts of polycrystalline fe@xmath9o@xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the influence of domain wall movement on the resistivity behaviour of ferromagnetic manganite is not unlikely , because the transport properties are strongly dependent on the magnetic states in manganites .",
    "the effect of domain wall movement on the resistivity has been reported in cases of thin film @xcite . however , the report on the electron scattering correlated to the domain wall dynamics , which is reflected in the resistivity behaviour , is very rare in the polycrystalline samples of manganites @xcite . here ,",
    "we observe the effect of domain wall movement in the temperature , magnetic field and time dependence of @xmath18 . an anomaly in @xmath32/@xmath33",
    "is noticed around 55 k. the hysteresis of mr curves is clearly observed for t @xmath49 55 k. in case of relaxation of @xmath18 , the sample was first cooled to 40 k from room temperature with magnetic field of 2 koe , waited for @xmath50 and then the relaxation was measured just after switching off the magnetic field . in this experimental condition the following features may be suggested that the system can memorize the tracks of domain wall movements and the effect of the switching off the magnetic field at @xmath50 , which is reflected in the dynamics of @xmath18 by the discontinuous change at @xmath50 .",
    "the above experimental results show an interesting feature of memory effects in the relaxation of @xmath18 , which is ascribed to the domain wall dynamics .",
    "the values of @xmath29 in the low - field magnetization shift toward lower temperature with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the paramagnetic to fm transition is spread over a wide temperature range . a large difference between the zfc and fc magnetization",
    "is observed in addition to the slow decreasing trend with temperature up to the lowest measured temperature even for the measurement at 1 koe . the magnetization curve at 5 k",
    "does not indicate saturating tendency even up to 50 koe magnetic field .",
    "the above features are the necessary ingredients of sg features in the system .",
    "in fact , the competition between orbitally ordered afm and orbitally disordered fm states may lead to the sg phase , which has been observed in different cases of manganites . note that the positive values of @xmath32/@xmath33 below @xmath2 exhibits the metallic states , which does not fit well with sg state .",
    "the neutron diffraction results confirm the long range fm ordering below @xmath2 @xcite , which rules out the possibility of real sg state at low temperature .",
    "in such a case , the explanation of the existence of domain wall movement below @xmath2 is rather justified than the glassy states .    the crystal structure , magnetic and transport properties of the present self doped oxygen deficient compound exhibits fm metallic state at low temperature , where the characteristic features do not reflect the normal features of typical ferromagnet .",
    "the weak thermal hysteresis is noted below 155 k , which indicates the features of first order transition .",
    "the thermal hysteresis in @xmath18 does not appear in case of monoclinic phase of oxygen annealed sample .",
    "note that the thermal hysteresis again appears convincingly in case of low fe substitution with monoclinic structure , where the random substitution of fe introduces the inhomogeneities into the lattice .",
    "recently , the existence of local clustering and structural disorder were suggested out by troyanchuk _",
    "et al_. to establish an intrinsic chemical and structural inhomogeneity in the orthorhombically distorted la@xmath58mno@xmath1 ( 2.86 @xmath59 ) @xcite . however , they discussed such possibility based on the value of moment , which is less than the value of full spin arrangement in the ferromagnetically ordered state .",
    "the structural and magnetic properties of the present compound characterize the oxygen stoichiometry in within the above limit , where the thermal hysteresis in @xmath18 directly shows the evidence of structurally disorder induced phase separation in the oxygen deficient self doped manganites . in fact , the recent theoretical model@xcite supported by the experimental observation in low hole doped la(sr)mno@xmath9 also exhibits the existence of intrinsic structural inhomogeneity in manganites @xcite . here",
    ", the mi transition at 144 k is broadened in contrast to the sharp mi transition observed for hole doped manganites and the oxygen annealed self doped , la@xmath0mno@xmath1(o@xmath16 ) .",
    "the temperature dependences of @xmath18 and @xmath17 surprisingly exhibit the clear evidence of zfc - fc effect much higher than @xmath2 , which suggests the short range fm clusters are developed well above @xmath2 . in addition , inverse of susceptibility deviates from curie - weiss behaviour around @xmath23 240 k , which is much higher than @xmath2 at @xmath23 130 k. the above results are consistent with the existence of inhomogeneous phase separation , which is originated partially due to the growth of short range fm clusters of different distribution of sizes above @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the orbitally disordered fm clusters , the orbitally ordered afm phase may coexist , which might be responsible for the structural inhomogeneities . however , the detailed microscopic experiment viz . , neutron diffraction is suggested to confirm the origin of the structural inhomogeneities .",
