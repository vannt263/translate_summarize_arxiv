    "this becomes evident at the example of a two - band chern insulator in which the chern number does not change during the dynamics , but the hall conductance is logarithmically divergent @xcite .",
    "similarly , after a quantum quench in the haldane model , the chern number does not change , but the signatures of the edge state as a chiral current can develop @xcite .",
