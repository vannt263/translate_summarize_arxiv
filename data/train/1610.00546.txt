    "so far , the higgs boson properties measured at the lhc experiments are consistent with the standard model ( sm ) predictions . deviations are , however , not yet excluded and could indicate physics beyond the sm .",
    "for instance , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the discovered higgs boson can well be the lightest neutral higgs boson , @xmath6 , with a mass of 125 gev and sm - like couplings .",
    "non - minimal quark - flavour violation ( qfv ) in the squark sector of the mssm can additionally affect the higgs interactions at one - loop level , still being consistent with the b - physics constrains .",
    "we study two important decays of the higgs boson : into a pair of bottom quarks and into a pair of charm quarks at one - loop level in the mssm with general squark mixing .",
    "we consider mainly mixing between the two heavy generations up- and down - squarks , i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8mixing .",

    "this talk is based on ref .",

    "we define the qfv parameters in the up - type squark sector of the mssm as follows : @xmath9 \\delta^{urr}_{\\alpha\\beta } & \\equiv & m^2_{u \\alpha\\beta } / \\sqrt{m^2_{u \\alpha\\alpha } m^2_{u \\beta\\beta}}~ , \\label{eq : insrr}\\\\[3 mm ] \\delta^{url}_{\\alpha\\beta } & \\equiv & ( v_2/\\sqrt{2 } ) t_{u\\alpha \\beta } / \\sqrt{m^2_{u \\alpha\\alpha } m^2_{q \\beta\\beta}}~ , \\label{eq : insrl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denote the quark flavours @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",

    "we mainly focus on the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 mixing , which is described by the qfv parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively .",

    "[ mbchami1 ] the mass insertions in the @xmath144 line can be deduced from the results for the bottom self - energy with gluino in the loop .",

    "finally , we obtain the approximate result @xmath146 where the explicit result for the terms @xmath147 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) is lengthy and therefore not shown here .",

    "[ fig2 ] the dependence on the qfv parameters @xmath153 and @xmath154 is shown .",
    "it is seen that in the case of @xmath155 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] ) the variation due to correlated @xmath156 and @xmath157 mixing can vary up to @xmath5 in the region allowed by the constraints . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] with fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] one can see that there exist regions where both widths considered simultaneously deviate significantly from their sm prediction .",

    "@xcite , we have shown that in the case of @xmath129 the deviation from the sm is entirely due to qfv .",
    "however , it is known that in the mssm @xmath158 can differ considerably from the sm due to quark - flavour conserving ( qfc ) contributions  @xcite . in fig.[fig3](a )",
    "the individual one - loop contributions to @xmath158 as a function of @xmath153 are shown .",
    "the top curve shows the full one - loop contribution to the width with no approximation .",
    "it is seen that the main one - loop contribution to @xmath158 comes from qfc gluino and chargino exchange .",
    "nevertheless , there exist a region for large and negative @xmath153 where the qfv component can be comparable with the qfc component .",
    "the qfv component is mainly due to chargino exchange which involves mixing in the @xmath159-sector . on the other hand , the qfv gluino exchange , which plays a major role in the @xmath160 case , in the @xmath161 case involves @xmath162 quarks",
    "whose mixing is strongly suppressed , and hence , this contribution is very small and thus not considered here .",
    "it is also interesting that the qfv component receives a large contribution from the dependence of @xmath163 on the higgs mass and the angle @xmath53 , which depend on the qfv parameters . in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and  [ fig3](b ) this contribution is denoted by @xmath164 .",

    "( 4.38 ) therein .",

    "[ fig3](a ) with fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . the difference between the dotted curve and the upper curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , therefore , is mainly due to the relatively slow mi convergence of the @xmath169  fv contribution .",
