    "resonant amplification of multi - vortex kelvin - tkachenko waves can lead to vortex reconnections when the amplitude of the modes exceeds the intervortex spacing , onsetting quantum turbulence in these superfluid systems . in future , systematic investigation of interaction dynamics of vortex waves in bose - einstein condensates",
