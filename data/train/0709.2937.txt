    "galilean invariance requires the existence of solutions of the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is an arbitrary static solution ( say , a domain wall ) and @xmath67 is an arbitrary velocity . as explained above , this is only possible when @xmath55 .",
    "however , the general validity of the galilean invariance assumption for the current - carrying state needs to be discussed in more detail from a microscopic point of view .",
    "the galilean invariance argument @xcite implies that the bias - induced electron drift exactly corresponds to the domain - wall velocity , since otherwise electron motion would persist in the frame that moves with the domain wall . referring to eq .",
    "( [ gi ] ) , we must , therefore , identify @xmath68 with the average electron drift velocity in the presence of the current @xmath42 .",

    "when there is no asymmetry between the scattering times , @xmath73 , @xmath67 indeed equals the electron drift velocity and galilean invariance is effectively fulfilled . in general , however , since the spin dependence of wave functions and densities of states for the electrons at the fermi energy lead to different scattering cross sections in conducting ferromagnets , the equality between @xmath74 and the average drift velocity disappears . in the simplest model of perturbative white - noise impurity potentials , for example , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the spin - dependent density of states .",
    "assuming parabolic free - electron bands and weak ferromagnets , in which the ferromagnetic exchange splitting is much less than the fermi energy , the domain - wall velocity @xmath68 actually becomes @xmath77 of the average drift velocity @xmath78 , @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is the spin-@xmath72 electron drift velocity , and we used the relation @xmath81 , which is valid in three dimensions .",
    "clearly , the potential disorder breaks galilean invariance .",
    "an identity of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can therefore not be deduced from general symmetry principles .",
    "furthermore , spin - orbit interaction or magnetic disorder that strongly affect the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see below ) also break galilean invariance at the level of the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , for itinerant ferromagnets we show below that @xmath82 ( where by @xmath83 we mean  of the order \" ) , with @xmath84 in the simplest model of weak and isotropic spin - dephasing impurities @xcite , which implies that deviations from translational invariance are not very important in metallic ferromagnets , such as transition metals and their alloys , in which the stoner model is applicable .",
    "very recently , two independent groups measured @xmath84 in permalloy nanowires @xcite .",
    "let us also consider the @xmath85 model of ferromagnetism .",
    "when , as is usually done , the @xmath86-orbital lattice is assumed spatially locked , galilean invariance is broken even in the absence of disorder . in this case , the ratio @xmath87 deviates strongly from unity , although it remains to be relatively insensitive to the strength of spin - dependent impurities . in other words ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 scale similarly with the strength of spin - dephasing processes , and their ratio appears to be determined mainly by band - structure effects and the nature ( rather than the strength ) of the disorder @xcite . a predictive material - dependent theory of magnetization damping and current - induced domain wall motion that transcends the toy models mentioned above is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "the form of the equation of motion ( [ lla ] ) for the special case @xmath55 has also triggered the suggestion @xcite that the landau - lifshitz form of damping , @xmath88 , is more natural than the gilbert form , @xmath89 . in our opinion , however , such a distinction is purely semantic .",
    "both forms are odd under time reversal , and one can easily imagine simple models in which either form arises more naturally than the other : for example , a bloch - like @xmath90 relaxation added to the stoner model naturally leads to a landau - lifshitz form of damping @xcite , whereas the dynamic interface spin pumping @xcite very generally obeys the gilbert damping form . moreover , mathematically , both equations are identical ( in the absence of any additional torques ) , since we have shown above that the landau - lifshitz form of damping follows from the gilbert one simply by multiplying both sides of the llg form by @xmath56 from the left ( and vice versa by @xmath91 ) . only at the special point @xmath55 ,",
    "the landau - lifshitz form ( [ lla ] ) does not involve the  @xmath1 term . \" in that limit , it may be a more transparent expression for the equation of motion .",
    "on the other hand , we noted above that in general @xmath60 and the ratio @xmath87 depends on material and sample .",
    "the current - driven dynamics of domain walls and other spatially nonuniform magnetization distributions turn out to be very sensitive to small deviations of @xmath87 from unity , which strongly reduces any advantage a landau - lifshitz damping formulation might have over the gilbert phenomenology . in general , we therefore prefer to use the gilbert phenomenology .    under time reversal ,",
    "the electric current as well as the magnetization vector change sign and the adiabatic current - induced torque is symmetric , thus nondissipative .",
    "the ohmic dissipation generated by this current does not depend on the magnetization texture in this limit and is intentionally disregarded .",
    "saslow @xcite prefers to discuss a torque driven by voltage rather current , which , after inserting ohm s law for the current , becomes odd under time reversal and thus appears dissipative ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for another discussion of this point ) . obviously , the @xmath1 correction torque is odd for the current - biased and even for the voltage - biased configurations .",
    "the current - bias picture appears to be more natural , since it reflects the absence of additional dissipation by the magnetization texture in the adiabatic limit as well as the close relation between the @xmath1 correction and the gilbert dissipation .",
    "let us now pursue some special aspects of the solutions of the phenomenological eq .",

    "typically , the anisotropies originate from the demagnetization fields : for a ferromagnetic wire , for example , the magnetostatic energy is lowest when the magnetization is in the wire direction , so that there are no stray field lines outside the ferromagnet .",
    "the effective field governing magnetization dynamics is then given by @xmath96 where we also included an applied field @xmath97 along the @xmath92 axis and the exchange coupling parametrized by the stiffness constant @xmath98 .",
