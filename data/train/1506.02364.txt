    "many glaciers and ice sheets are polythermal with disjoint cold and temperate domains , separated by the cold  temperate transition surface ( cts ) @xcite . both the greenland and antarctic ice sheets are canadian - type polythermal , that is , they are mainly cold , except for distributed temperate layers at the base where strain heating is largest and where there is a geothermal contribution .",
    "it is thus important to model the thermodynamics of ice sheets correctly by distinguishing both domains and accounting for the transition conditions between them .",
    "various methods allow one to model the thermodynamic conditions in ice sheets .",
    "thus far , sicopolis ( simulation code for polythermal ice sheets ; e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; url www.sicopolis.net ) is the only three - dimensional ice sheet model that employs the _ polythermal two - layer scheme_. in this method , the temperature and water - content fields in the two domains , cold and temperate ice , are computed on separate numerical domains , and the transition conditions at the cts are used to track its position .    in most older ice sheet models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the _ cold - ice method _ was applied by resetting any computed temperatures that exceed the local pressure melting point to the local pressure melting point . while very simple , this means that energy is lost , and the water content in the temperate layer as well as the transition conditions at the cts are ignored .",
    "the cold - ice method has , however , always been available in sicopolis as an alternative to the polythermal two - layer method .",
    "@xcite introduced a new , enthalpy - based approach for ice sheet thermodynamics . in this method ,",
    "the thermodynamic fields of temperature in cold ice and water content in temperate ice are replaced by one common thermodynamic field , enthalpy , for both domains , and only one common field equation must be solved .",

    "two different conditions of the cts must be distinguished .",
    "for melting conditions , cold ice flows across the cts into the temperate layer , where water starts to accumulate due to strain heating along trajectories . the opposite situation , freezing conditions , occurs further downstream , where temperate ice flows across the cts into the cold domain and the accumulated water content freezes out , releasing latent heat . for melting conditions ,",
    "the temperature gradient and the water content are continuous across the cts , while for freezing conditions , discontinuities of these quantities occur @xcite . since the cts tends to be rather steep near the terminus",

    "compared the performance of four different versions of the enthalpy scheme for a parallel - sided slab with a custom - designed finite - difference program . besides the conventional enthalpy scheme , they considered the _ two - layer front - tracking enthalpy scheme _ ( an enthalpy version of the polythermal two - layer scheme mentioned above ) , the _ one - layer melting - cts enthalpy scheme _ and the _ one - layer freezing - cts enthalpy scheme_. in the two latter schemes ,",
    "explicit tracking of the melting or freezing cts , based on the respective transition conditions at the cts , has been added to the conventional enthalpy scheme .",
    "an important finding of these works was that the conventional one - layer enthalpy scheme can produce correct solutions for melting conditions at the cts , provided that the numerical handling of the discontinuity of the enthalpy diffusivity across the cts is done carefully .",
    "however , especially for finite - difference techniques , concluded that it is safer to use the one - layer melting - cts enthalpy scheme , which enforces the transition conditions explicitly .",
    "for freezing conditions , the conventional one - layer enthalpy scheme fails because it can not handle the associated discontinuities of the thermodynamic fields , and it is thus imperative to enforce the transition conditions at the cts explicitly , as it is done in the one - layer freezing - cts enthalpy scheme .    for this study , in addition to the previously existing polythermal two - layer and cold - ice schemes",

    "thus , the numerical solution for each vertical profile is similar to the solution of the one - dimensional problem by an implicit scheme , and the horizontal advection terms of the three - dimensional equation play the role of additional , explicitly discretized source terms .",

    "the ability to turn off the freezing conditions is a newly - implemented option for the poly scheme .",
    "the cold - ice scheme ( scheme code : cold ) is the most simple , yet physically incorrect way to deal with polythermal conditions in ice sheets .",

    "the excess heat of the temperate layer becomes lost , so that the scheme does not conserve energy .",

    "[ fig : expa1_10km_02a ] and [ fig : exph1_10km_02a ] as well as the entries in table  [ tab_results_expa1a2h1 ] reveals that the addition of some basal sliding reduces the volume of temperate ice strongly .",
    "this is a consequence of increased advection of cold surface ice downward and outward , and of reduced strain heating . like for experiments",
    "a1 and a2 , the computed temperate ice volume decreases in the order cold @xmath106 entc @xmath106 entm @xmath106 poly .",
    "however , even the entm scheme overpredicts the temperate ice volume by more than a factor 2 compared to the poly scheme .",
    "this is because the thicknesses are so small that any one - layer scheme does not resolve them well ( unless a very high vertical resolution is employed ) , whereas the performance of the two - layer poly scheme is not limited by this problem .",
    "figure [ fig : exph1_10km_02a]b shows further that in the distribution of temperate ice obtained with the cold scheme some spokes emerge .",
    "the spokes are also present in similar form in the results of the three other schemes when the basal temperature is plotted instead of the thickness of the temperate ice layer ( not shown ) .",
    "this phenomenon was already observed in the original article on the eismint phase  2 simplified geometry experiments @xcite .",
    "it is most likely a consequence of the combined effects of a thermoviscous flow instability and the symmetry of the numerical grid .    since the sliding coefficient in experiment  h1 is small , the melt fraction and the total ice volume only decrease slightly compared to those of experiment  a1 , and the ice area is virtually unchanged .",
    "this underlines the very high sensitivity of the temperate ice layer to changed flow conditions . for the original experiment",
    "h with a 10 times larger sliding coefficient ( results not shown ) , the large - scale response of the ice sheet is more pronounced . for this scenario ,",
    "only the cold scheme produces a temperate layer of non - zero thickness , while the other schemes merely produce a temperate base .",
    "we tested four different thermodynamics solvers in the ice sheet model sicopolis .",
    "two of them are the previously existing polythermal two - layer ( poly ) and cold - ice ( cold ) schemes , while the other two are the newly implemented conventional one - layer enthalpy ( entc ) and melting - cts one - layer enthalpy ( entm ) schemes .",
    "the entc scheme goes back to the study by @xcite , while the entm scheme was introduced by for a one - dimensional ice slab .",
    "extension to the full , three - dimensional problem was straightforward because , due to the neglect of horizontal diffusive heat fluxes , the computation of the thermodynamic fields ( temperature and water content or enthalpy ) is essentially one - dimensional for each column .",
    "horizontal advection merely plays the role of an additional source term for the vertical profiles and does not constitute a problem for the implementation of the scheme .",
    "we used two scenarios from the suite of eismint ( european ice sheet modeling initiative ) phase  2 simplified geometry experiments @xcite as our model problems , one without and one with basal sliding .",
    "like in the one - dimensional study carried out by , the results computed with the poly scheme were assessed to be most reliable and thus chosen as a reference .    as it was already reported by @xcite ,",
    "the cold scheme strongly overpredicts thicknesses of temperate ice layers , and thus temperate ice volumes .",
    "choosing a small time step reduces the amount of overprediction to a certain extent , but the performance of the cold scheme ( which is not energy - conserving and thus physically incorrect anyway ) is not satisfactory .    the studies by and , both carried out for a canadian - type parallel - sided slab , found that the entc scheme , even though it does not enforce the transition conditions at the cts explicitly , still fulfills them for the case of melting conditions ( continuity of the enthalpy and the sensible heat flux ) , provided that the discontinuity of the enthalpy diffusivity ( [ eq : enthalpy - diffusivity ] ) at the cts is properly accounted for in the discretization of the diffusion term in the enthalpy equation ( [ eq : enthalpy ] ) .",
    "this could not be confirmed in the present study : even though the entc scheme has been implemented in sicopolis in the same way as described by , the scheme fails to produce a continuous temperature gradient across the cts and overpredicts temperate ice layer thicknesses , albeit to a smaller degree than the cold scheme ( always compared to the references provided by the poly scheme ) .",
    "we speculate that this is a consequence of the three - dimensionality of the problem investigated here , most likely due to the additional horizontal advection terms in the enthalpy equation .",
    "in contrast to the entc scheme , the continuity of the temperature gradient across the cts is explicitly enforced by the entm scheme .",
    "this leads to a better match of computed temperate ice layer thicknesses to those computed by the poly scheme ; however , some overprediction remains .",
    "the price to pay for enforcing a continuous temperature gradient across the cts , while the positioning of the cts is limited by the grid resolution , is a slight discontinuity of the ice temperature itself .",
    "when comparing the temperature profiles in the ice column above the cts , the entc and entm schemes both perform well compared to the poly scheme , while the temperatures produced by the cold scheme are too high .",
    "the water content in the temperate ice layer below the cts usually reaches the threshold value of 0.01 ( 1% ) for the poly , entc and entm schemes , while the cold scheme does not compute any water content .    for large time steps in conjunction with a water - content - dependent rate factor",
    ", the poly scheme can produce a wavy distribution of the temperate - layer thickness .",
    "therefore , some care is required to choose a sufficiently small time step to avoid this instability . however , in contrast to the `` academic '' eismint application considered here , real - world applications require small time steps for overall numerical stability anyway . at @xmath110 horizontal resolution ,",
    "greenland simulations with sicopolis typically require time steps of @xmath111 , and antarctica simulations with coupled sheet ",
    "shelf dynamics even smaller ones .",
    "so this instability is most likely not a matter of concern for most practical applications with complex topographies .",
    "the entc and entm schemes produce some temporal and spatial noise for the volume and thickness of the temperate ice .",
    "this does not happen for the poly and cold schemes ; it is related to the one - layer approach in which we position the cts at the uppermost grid point in the temperate layer , whereas the poly scheme allows , in principle , tracking the position of the cts to arbitrary accuracy .",
    "a possible improvement of the one - layer enthalpy schemes would be to implement a sub - grid tracking of the cts position , which would likely allow to fulfill the continuity of the temperate and of the temperature gradient across the cts simultaneously and reduce the noise .",
    "however , such a sub - grid tracking scheme will inevitably increase the computational cost .    to sum up , for a polythermal ice sheet model",
    ", the one - layer enthalpy schemes entc and entm are viable , easier to implement alternatives to the poly scheme with its slightly awkward need to handle two different numerical domains for cold and temperate ice .",
    "entm is more precise than entc for determining the position of the cts , and thus the volume and thickness of the temperate ice layer .",
    "the performance of both schemes is good for the temperature profiles in the cold ice column above the cts and also the water content in the temperate ice layer below the cts .",
