    "i shall start my talk from the end with the short answer to the question in the title .",
    "the study of the inclusive reactions in the region of diffraction dissociation at high energies provides a unique possibility to learn on a new type of interactions between elementary particles or a new type of fundamental forces , which the three - body forces are . what was the beginning on ?    in 1994",
    "the cdf group at fermilab published new results on the measurements of @xmath0 single diffraction dissociation at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "they observed that a popular supercritical pomeron model did not describe new measured values .",
    "the statement , made in @xcite , is as follows : the value of @xmath3 , measured at @xmath4 , is extrapolated by the supercritical pomeron model to @xmath5 at @xmath6 , while the measured value at this energy is equal to @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio of the measured @xmath8 to that obtained by extrapolation is ( = 1800  gev ) = 0.680.05 .",
    "[ 1 ] moreover , at @xmath9 the experimental @xmath10 is 4.5 times larger than the value @xmath11 , obtained by the extrapolation of the measured value of @xmath12 at @xmath13 down to @xmath14 with the help of the supercritical pomeron model .",
    "so , the latest experimental measurement of @xmath0 single diffraction dissociation at c.m.s .",
    "energies @xmath1 and @xmath2 , carried out by the cdf group at the fermilab tevatron collider , has shown that the popular model of supercritical pomeron does not describe the existing experimental data .",
    "we called the emerged situation as a supercrisis for the supercritical pomeron model ( scpm ) . at small @xmath15 and total @xmath16 cross section from @xmath17 measurements as a function of @xmath18 for different @xmath19 . ]",
    "the supercrisis is illustrated on fig . 1 extracted from paper @xcite .    the attempts undertaken in refs .",
    "@xcite to save the scpm are also shown on this figure .",
    "unfortunately glm paper @xcite contains a crude mathematical mistake .",
    "the mistake was observed by b.v .",
    "struminsky and e.s .",
    "martynov from kiev @xcite .",
    "besides , in our opinion , an eikonalization procedure can not be considered as a saving ring for scpm because this procedure is outside the original regge ideology . the idea of renormalized pomeron flux proposed by goulianos is a good physical idea for an experimentalist , but this idea can not be a satisfactory one for a theorist because the idea is not grounded by the underlying regge theory .    obviously , the foundations of the pomeron model require a further theoretical study and the construction of newer , more general phenomenological framework , which would enable one to remove the discrepancy between the model predictions and the experiment .",
    "although nowadays we have in the framework of local quantum field theory a gauge model of strong interactions formulated in terms of the known qcd lagrangian , its relations to the so called  soft \" ( interactions at large distances ) hadronic physics are far from desired .",
    "the understanding of this physics is high interest because it has an intrinsically fundamental nature .    in 1970",
    "the experiments at the serpukhov accelerator revealed that the @xmath20 total cross section increased with energy .",
    "the increase of the @xmath21 total cross section was discovered at the cern isr and then the effect of rising total cross sections was confirmed at the fermilab accelerator .    in spite of more than 25 years after the formulation of qcd",
    "we still can not obtain from the qcd lagrangian the answer to the question why all the hadronic total cross - sections grow with energy .",
    "we can not predict total cross - sections in an absolute way starting from the fundamental qcd lagrangian as well mainly because it is not a perturbative problem .",
    "it is well known , e.g. , that nonperturbative contributions to the gluon propagator influence the behaviour of  soft \" hadronic processes and the knowledge of the infrared behaviour of qcd is certainly needed to describe the  soft \" hadronic physics in the framework of qcd",
    ". unfortunately , today we do nt know the whole picture of the infrared behaviour of qcd , we have some fragments of this picture though ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    at the same time it is more or less",
    "clear now that the rise of the total cross - sections is just the shadow ( not antishadow ! ) of particle production .    through the optical theorem",
    "the total cross - section is related to the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude in the forward direction . that is why the theoretical understanding of elastic scattering has the fundamental importance .    from the unitarity relation",
    "it follows that the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude contains the contribution of all possible inelastic channels in two - particle interaction .",
    "it is clear therefore that we can not understand the elastic scattering without understanding the inelastic interaction .    among all the possible inelastic interactions",
    "there is a special class of processes which are called a single diffraction dissociation .",
    "the single diffraction dissociation is the scattering process where one of two particles in the initial state breaks up during the interaction producing a system of particles in a limited region of ( pseudo)rapidity . where @xmath22 is the polar angle of the produced particle with respect to the beam direction .",
    "pseudorapidity is frequently used as an approximation to rapidity . ]",
    "good and walker have shown @xcite that the single diffraction dissociation is predicted by the basic principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "however both the elastic scattering and single diffraction dissociation can not correctly be calculated in qcd due to the non - perturbative nature of the interactions .",
    "the popular regge phenomenology represents elastic and diffractive scattering by the exchange of the pomeron , a color singlet reggeon with quantun numbers of the vacuum .",
    "it should be noted that the definition of the pomeron as reggeon with the highest regge trajectory @xmath23 , carrying the quantum numbers of the vacuum , is not the only one .",
    "is responsible for the growth of hadronic cross - sections with energy .",
    "] there are many other definitions of the pomeron : pomeron is a gluon  ladder \" @xcite ; pomeron is a bound state of two reggezied gluons ",
    "bfkl - pomeron @xcite ; soft and hard pomerons @xcite ; etc .",
    "this leapfrog is because of the exact nature of the pomeron and its detailed substructure remains such as that no one knows what it is .",
    "the difficulty of establishing the true nature of the pomeron in qcd is almost obviously related to the calculations of non - perturbative gluon exchange .    nevertheless in the near past simple formulae of the regge phenomenology provided good parameterization of experimental data on  soft \" hadronic physics and pragmatic application of pomeron phenomenology",
    "had been remarkably successful ( see e.g. the latest issue of the review of particles properties ) .",
    "that was the case before the appearance of the above - mentioned cdf data on single diffractive dissociation and recent results from hera .",
    "of course , it is good that we have a simple and compact form for representing a great variety of data for different hadronic processes , but it is certainly bad that power behaved total cross - sections violate unitarity .",
    "often and often encountered claim , that the model with power behaved total cross - sections is valid in the non - asymptotic domain which has been explored up today , is not correct because the supercritical pomeron model is an asymptotic one by definition .",
    "we suggested another approach to the dynamical description of one - particle inclusive reactions @xcite .",
    "the main point of our approach is that new fundamental three - body forces are responsible for the dynamics of particle production processes of inclusive type .",
    "our consideration revealed several fundamental properties of one - particle inclusive cross - sections in the region of diffraction dissociation .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the slope of the diffraction cone in @xmath0 single diffraction dissociation is related to the effective radius of three - nucleon forces in the same way as the slope of the diffraction cone in elastic @xmath0 scattering is related to the effective radius of two - nucleon forces .",
    "it was also demonstrated that the effective radii of two- and three - nucleon forces , which are the characteristics of elastic and inelastic interactions of two nucleons , define the structure of the @xmath0 total cross - sections in a simple and physically clear form .",
    "i ll touch upon these properties later on .",
    "first of all let me tell you a few words what i mean by three - body forces about .",

    "the experimental data on proton - proton total cross - sections display a more complex structure at low energies than the proton - antiproton ones .",
    "to describe this complex structure we , of course , have to modify formula ( [ 55 ] ) without destroying the general structure given by eq .",

    ". it should be pointed out that our fit revealed that the resonance with the mass @xmath133 should be odd parity .",
    "our fit indicates that this resonance is strongly confirmed by the set of experimental data on proton - proton total cross - sections .",
    "that is why a further study of diproton resonances is very desirable .    the figures 4 - 11 display a very good correspondence of theoretical formula ( [ 39 ] ) to the existing experimental data on proton - proton and proton - antiproton total cross - sections .",
    "i d like to emphasize the following attractive features of formula ( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "this formula represents hadronic total cross - section in a factorized form .",
    "one factor describes high - energy asymptotics of total cross - section and it has the universal energy dependence predicted by the froissart theorem",
    ". other factor is responsible for the behaviour of total cross - section at low energies and this factor has also a universal asymptotics at the elastic threshold .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that the low - energy asymptotics of total cross - section at the elastic threshold is dictated by the high - energy asymptotics of three - body ( three - nucleon in that case ) forces .",
    "this means that we undoubtedly faced very deep physical phenomena here .",
    "the appearance of new threshold @xmath134 in proton - proton channel , which is near to the elastic threshold , is a nontrivial fact too .",
    "it s clear that the difference of two identical terms with different thresholds in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 62 ] ) is a tail of crossing symmetry which was not actually taken into account in our consideration .",
    "what physical entity does this new threshold correspond to ?",
    "this interesting question is still open .",
    "anyway we have established that simple theoretical formula ( [ 39 ] ) described the global structure of @xmath21 and @xmath0 total cross - sections in the whole range of energies available up today .",
    "of course , our results concerning a global description of hadronic total cross - sections are to be considered as preliminary ones . we know the ways how they can be refined later on .",
    "we have shown above that the slope of diffraction cone in the single diffraction dissociation is related to the effective interaction radius for three - body forces b_sd(s , m_x^2 ) = r_0 ^ 2(|s , s_0),[65 ] @xmath135    let us define the slope of diffraction cone in the single diffraction dissociation at a fixed point over the missing mass b^sd(s ) = b_sd(s , m_x^2)_m_x^2 = 2m_n^2.[66 ] now taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ 40],[41 ] ) where the effective interaction radius for three - body forces can be extracted from r_0 ^ 2(2s,2s_0 ) = r_0 ^ 2(s , s_0 ) = ^tot(s ) - b^el(s),[67 ] and the equation ^el(s ) = , (= 0)[68 ] we come to the fundamental relation between the slopes in the single diffraction dissociation and elastic scattering , [ 69 ] where x . the quantity @xmath136 has a clear physical meaning , it has been introduced in the papers of c.n .",
    "yang and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "we found @xmath137 at @xmath138 ( see the cdf paper mentioned in introduction ) .",
    "hence , in that case we have @xmath139 which is confirmed not so badly in the experimental measurements .    in the limit of the black disk @xmath140",
    "we obtain , [ 70 ] and .",
    "so , we observe that there is quite a nontrivial dynamics in the slopes of diffraction cone in the single diffraction dissociation and elastic scattering processes . in particular",
    ", we can study an intriguing question on the black disk limit not only in the measurements of total hadronic cross - sections compared with elastic ones but in the measurements of the slopes in single diffraction dissociation processes together with elastic scattering ones .",
    "there is a more general formula which can be derived with account of the real parts for the amplitudes .",
    "this formula looks like .[71 ] if @xmath141 or @xmath142 , then we come to eq .",
    "( [ 69 ] ) . in the case",
    "when @xmath143 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 71 ] ) in the form _ 0 = .[72 ] eq . (",
    "[ 72 ] ) can be used for the calculation of the new quantity @xmath144 .",
    "anyway , the measurements of real parts for the amplitudes seem to play an important role in the future high energy hadronic physics .",
    "for the total single diffractive dissociation cross - section defined as _",
    "sd(s ) = 2_m_min^2 ^ 0.1s_t_-(m_x^2)^t_+ ( m_x^2 ) dt a(s , m_x^2)[73 ] we obtained the following asymptotic formula _",
    "sd(s ) = , [ 74 ] where @xmath145 are related to effective interaction radius for three - body forces @xmath146 and @xmath147 to be found from the fit to the experimental data on @xmath148 . the experimental values for @xmath0 single diffraction dissociation cross - sections , which were used , are listed in table ii .",
    "our fit yielded @xcite @xmath149 the fit result is shown in fig .",
    "as you can see , the fitting curve goes excellently over the experimental points of the cdf group at fermilab .",
    "thus , we have shown that from the generalized asymptotic theorems a l froissart there follows a simple formula which allows one to match the experimental data on @xmath0 single diffraction dissociation cross - sections at high energies including lower energies as well . at present only the suggested approach",
    "allows one to quantitatively describe the observed behaviour of @xmath0 single diffraction dissociation cross - sections .",
    "some time ago many high energy physicists thought that the increase of total cross - sections was due to the same increase of single diffraction dissociation cross - sections .",
    "now we know that this thought is wrong and , moreover , we understand why this is the case .    as it has been shown above the phenomenon of exceedingly moderate energy dependence of single diffraction dissociation cross - sections on @xmath49 observed by cdf at fermilab is a manifestation of unitarity saturation of three - nucleon forces at fermilab tevatron energies",
    ". this phenomenon is confirmed in the dynamics consistent with unitarity becoming apparent in the effect of screening of three - body forces by two - body ones .",
    "it is to be compared with the discovery of the increase of @xmath21 total cross - sections at cern isr and of the growth of @xmath150 total cross - sections revealed at serpukhov accelerator . in this context ,",
    "the cdf data are the ones of the most significant experimental results obtained in the last years .",
    "in fact , we have found the bound ( like froissart bound ! ) .[75 ]    i d like especially to point out that analyticity and unitarity together with the dynamic apparatus of single - time formalism in qft provide the clear answers to the asymptotic behaviour both the elastic scattering and single diffraction dissociation at high energies , which correspond to the experimentally observable picture .",
    "it is very nice that the understanding of  soft \" physics based on general principles of qft , such as analyticity and unitarity , is so fine confirmed by the experimentally observable picture compared to the models where the general principles have been broken down .",
    "i hope that it will be possible to test the obtained results at higher energies , such as those of the lhc collider and even higher ones .",
    "conditionally there are two forms of strong interaction dynamics : t - channel form and s - channel one . 0.1 true in    * t - channel form *    0.1 true in the fundamental quantity here is some set of regge trajectories : t - channel form _",
    "r(t).[76 ] here subscript @xmath78 enumerates different regge trajectories which are the poles in the t - channel partial wave amplitudes for the given process .",
    "there are a lot of people who work in the field of t - channel dynamics of strong interactions .    some part of scientific community works in the field of s - channel form of strong interaction dynamics . 0.1 true in    * s - channel form *    0.1 true in the fundamental quantity here is an effective interaction radius of fundamental forces : s - channel form r_(s).[77 ] here subscript @xmath151 enumerates different types of hadrons and fundamental forces acting between them .",
    "the s - channel form of dynamics allows one to create a physically transparent and visual geometric picture of strong interactions for hadrons .",
    "i d like to emphasize the attractive features of this form of strong interaction dynamics .",
    "0.1 true in    * universality ( existence of pion with @xmath152 ) : @xmath153 * compatibility with the general principles of relativistic quantum theory .",
    "* fine mathematical structures are given by the global analyticity together with single - time formalism in qft .",
    "that is why , in our opinion , the s - channel form of strong interaction dynamics is more preferable than the t - channel one .",
