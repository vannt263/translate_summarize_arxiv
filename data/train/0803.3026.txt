    "<S> the zero temperature mott transition region in antiferromagnetic , spin s=5/2 mno is probed using the correlated band theory lsda+u method . </S>",
    "<S> the first transition encountered is an insulator - insulator volume collapse within the rocksalt structure that is characterized by an unexpected hund s rule violating ` spin - flip ' moment collapse . this spin - flip to s=1/2 takes fullest advantage of the anisotropy of the coulomb repulsion , allowing gain in the kinetic energy ( which increases with decreasing volume ) while retaining a sizable amount of the magnetic exchange energy .    </S>",
    "<S> while transition pressures vary with the interaction strength , the spin - flip state is robust over a range of interaction strengths and for both b1 and b8 structures .    </S>",
    "<S> the insulator - metal transition ( imt ) in correlated systems ( the mott transition ) is one of the most actively studied topics in condensed matter systems.@xcite the original , and most studied , model is that of the single - band hubbard model ( 1hm ) , characterized simply by bandwidth @xmath0 and on - site repulsion strength @xmath1 . roughly speaking , for @xmath2 it is an insulator characterized by localized states and local moments , while for @xmath3 the system is a nonmagnetic metal characterized by itinerant states . in a more general model </S>",

    "<S> it has recently been emphasized that degenerate multiorbital atoms ( @xmath4 orbitals ) with multielectron magnetic moments behave very differently . </S>",
    "<S> the critical interaction / bandwidth becomes @xmath5 or even larger,@xcite due to the increase in conduction ( hopping ) channels . </S>",
    "<S> another issue is that of a possible orbital selective mott transition , where only some of the orbitals undergo an imt transition@xcite depending on the interactions and the anisotropy of the hopping processes .    a much less studied question , one we address here , is how a multielectron local moment disintegrates under reduction of volume . </S>",
    "<S> while the moment may be considered to be enforced by the strong interaction @xmath1 ( as in the 1hm ) , the inter - orbital hund s coupling is also a strong factor because it will tend to promote a moment even in the itinerant phase . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic bonding ( hopping processes ) causes variation in bandwidths , and the moment collapse may be orbital selective : some but not all orbitals may become spin - paired ( doubly occupied ) , or selected spins may simply flip as the kinetic energy overcomes the hund s coupling but not the coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> pressure - driven collapses of magnetic signals reported in @xmath6i@xmath7 compounds ( @xmath8=v , mn , fe , co , ni)@xcite and feo@xcite , initially interpreted as mott transitions , have been reinterpreted as magnetic ( dis)ordering transitions rather than magnetic collapse.@xcite in this paper we provide predictions for the moment collapse transition in anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) mno at t=0 , which proceeds by a different route than any yet envisioned .    </S>",

    "<S> feo is reported to remain a magnetic insulator to 143 gpa.@xcite unlike for these room temperature experiments where the moments are disordered , the magnetic ground state phases we address will be ordered , and the resulting symmetry lowering@xcite and reduced fluctuations are found to affect the character , and probably the mechanism , of the transition .    </S>",
    "<S> previous theoretical work on mno at reduced volume has been carried out almost entirely in the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite in these approximations , the small gap at ambient volume rapidly closes leading to metallization at much too small a volume . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting occupation of minority @xmath11 states at the expense of majority @xmath12 states leads to a continuous decrease of the calculated moment well before the volume collapse , or moment collapse , transition . </S>",

    "<S> _ did apply the lsda+u method to the high volume phase to improve their picture of the mott transition .    to study the pressure behavior of mno , we have carried out total energy lsda+u calculations ( described below ) for both low and high pressure phases . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been shown that metal - to - insulator transitions , and even charge disproportion and ordering can be modeled realistically with the lsda+u method.@xcite the low pressure structure of mno is well established : it is an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) nacl structure with aligned spins in @xmath14111@xmath15 mn layers , antiparallel with adjacent layers ( afmii ) . in our calculations </S>",

    "<S> due to the unexpected nature of the reduced spin state , several results were checked , and reproduced , using the wien2k code.@xcite lsda+u gives two distinct spin states for both b1 and b8 structures : a low pressure high - spin ( hs ) s = @xmath26 configuration and a high pressure , low spin ( ls ) s = @xmath27 state . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state ( eos ) curves are displayed in fig.[b1b8ene ] . from the enthalpies we obtain a first - order magnetic transition from hs - b1 to ls - b1 at @xmath28=123 gpa , followed by a structural transition to ls - b8 at @xmath29=130 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the isostructural volume collapse at @xmath28 is @xmath30 . </S>",

    "<S> this part of our results has been compared with those of other correlated band theory results recently.@xcite an unusual feature of the present results is the persistence of the lsda+u bandgap up to higher pressures , beyond the observed imt at room temperature.@xcite thus the magnetic and structural transitions we discuss are always insulator - to - insulator , and for the magnetically ordered state at t=0 .    to help in understanding the mechanism of the transition </S>",

    "<S> [ ldaudos ] , referenced to the rhombohedral axis of the b1 afmii phase , and equivalently the hexagonal axis of the b8 structure . not evident from this figure are two potentially important features.@xcite first , the ` charge transfer ' energy increases as the volume decreases ; that is , the o @xmath20 levels drop in energy relative to the mn @xmath10 states , reflecting an _ increased _ tendency toward the fully ionic limit that competes with the increased hybridization as the mn and o ions approach each other . secondly , the crystal field splitting between @xmath33 and @xmath34 states increases under pressure , which competes with hund s exchange and with correlation effects .    </S>",
    "<S> in each case the mn site symmetry splits the 5 @xmath35-orbitals into two doublets @xmath36 , @xmath37=1 , 2 , with @xmath38 , and a singlet @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the actual state realized at a given volume or structure is characterized by two @xmath40 pairs , obtained by unitary mixing , schematically : @xmath41 we have observed and quantified the mixing angle @xmath42 versus pressure , but near the critical pressure it simplifies to @xmath43    the hs states in both b1 and b8 structures are simple  </S>",
    "<S> each 3@xmath35 orbital is filled once with spins aligned leading to an s=5/2 spherical ion . </S>",
    "<S> the ls dos for both structures reveal the essence of the hs - ls transition : the ls state is obtained by simply flipping the spins of the @xmath44 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> this result shows how the lsda+u method differs in an essential way from lsda , where the moment decreases continually with volume,@xcite metallization occurs at low pressure , and decrease of the moment implies rapid collapse of the exchange splitting , resulting in doubly occupied orbitals with zero net spin . in this ls state , </S>",
    "<S> each of the 3@xmath35 orbitals remains singly occupied , the charge density remains spherical while the spin density becomes highly anisotropic , as illustrated vividly in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spindens ] .    to understand the origin of this spin - flip state we have performed an analysis of the lsda+u method . </S>",
    "<S> the flavor we have used is the `` atomic limit '' ( al).@xcite we consider first the pressure - induced change in kinetic energy relative to the potential energy of the hs and ls states . </S>",
    "<S> we note first that the @xmath45 states , whose spins flip in the ls state , are @xmath46 and only @xmath47 in terms of the cubic states we are more familiar with . for the @xmath48 pair </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is opposite , and close to the overall mean ( @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> it is the cubic @xmath33 states ( and consequently the @xmath45 pair ) that have the strongest ( @xmath50 ) overlap with o ions , and thus are most affected by pressure and give the greatest gain in kinetic energy .    </S>",
    "<S> now we consider the effects of the very large anisotropy of the ls mn ion . </S>",
    "<S> to separate the effects of @xmath1 from those of @xmath31 , we split the energy expression into the isotropic interaction , and the remaining anisotropic part : @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the isotropic part reads @xmath52 \\geq 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the spin - dependent occupation number matrix of the @xmath10 shell , and tr denotes a trace of the orbital indices . </S>",
    "<S> it is easily seen that @xmath54 takes its minima for integer occupations , in which case we get @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the resulting potential matrix , to be added to the kohn - sham hamiltonian , is non - zero and has the effect of lowering occupied orbitals by @xmath56 , while raising unoccupied orbitals by @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this separation stabilizes insulating magnetic solutions , and also favors hs exchange energy contributions from the magnetic part of the lsda functional . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency opposes the observed hs - ls transition , but operates equally independent of volume . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the isotropic term is often the dominating effect of the lsda+u method , but the common practice of discussing the effects of the lsda+u method in the isotropic limit misses the physics of this transition , as we now illustrate .    </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic term reads ( in the representation in which @xmath58 is diagonal , for simplicity ) @xmath59    n_{\\mu}^{s^{\\prime}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the interaction matrix elements are defined as @xmath60 , @xmath61 in terms of the full matrix interaction @xmath62 , and these differences do _ not _ contain @xmath1 ( whose effect is included entirely in the isotropic term ) . </S>",
    "<S> these differences describe _ pure anisotropy _ ; summation of either index of either one gives a vanishing result . </S>",
    "<S> thus a filled spin subshell will not contribute to @xmath63 , as expected intuitively .    </S>",
    "<S> the hs state is favored by the lsda spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ls state still has all fully polarized orbitals , so the energy difference will be much smaller than for usual lsda s=5/2 and s=1/2 moments . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting ratio of exchange energies can be estimated from the integral over the square of the spin density , which gives a value @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction of exchange energy in the ls state is much less dramatic than the estimate from the simple formula @xmath65 . a more detailed explanation of this energy ratio is given in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> the ls configuration requires the @xmath66 orbital to be singly occupied . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining @xmath67 electrons then are distributed in pairs among the @xmath68 doublets . </S>",
    "<S> analysis shows that the two occupation patterns for which the electrons doubly occupy either the @xmath69 or @xmath70 orbitals have the same anisotropy energy of about @xmath71 ; a spread of energies arises from allowed mixing of @xmath40 symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spin density of such states has @xmath66-derived shape .    </S>",
    "<S> the remaining two patterns are obtained by occupying @xmath72 in the up - channel and @xmath73 in the down - channel or vice versa , both of which results in strongly anisotropic spin densities . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest energy of @xmath74 is obtained when the @xmath70 and @xmath66 are occupied in the same spin channel , while @xmath69 is occupied in the opposite channel ( note , the mixing angle @xmath42=0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other solution ( @xmath75 ) has @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the energies on the mixing angle complicates the discussion .    </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a gap of @xmath77 between the spin - flipped and non spin - flipped solutions , which is not closed by any mixing . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that this gap is due to the density - density anisotropy ( @xmath78 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eaniso ] ) ) , which pushes the ( density- ) non - spherical non spin - flipped patterns up in energy , while it is zero for the ( density- ) spherical spin - flipped patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange and self - interaction - correction contributions to the anisotropy ( @xmath79 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eaniso ] ) ) is nearly of the same size for the non spin - flipped and spin - flipped occupation patterns , and hence not changing the energy separation of these pattern classes . </S>",
    "<S> however , it further discriminates the two spin - flipped patterns .    </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy ( which is solely controlled by , and proportional to , @xmath31 in the lsda+u method ) of the interaction favors an occupation pattern which maximizes the spatial distance between the electrons ( under the constraint of @xmath80 ) , while the isotropic term @xmath81 merely selects insulating over metallic solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we indeed find that both the spin - flipped and non - spin flipped solutions may be found in lsda+u calculations , separated by an energy of the order derived here . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath31 is decreased to zero , the energy difference between these solutions shrinks , leaving only the lsda anisotropy energy difference , which turns out to be very small : about @xmath82 ev at ambient pressure and decreasing to zero close to the transition . </S>",
    "<S> of course the lsda part of the functional includes some anisotropy effects , however the main difference in the influence of the lsda - anisotropy and the @xmath31-anisotropy eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eaniso ] ) is its action on the kohn - sham states . </S>",
    "<S> the lsda potential contributions act on all states , while the lsda+u potential matrix acts orbital selective . </S>",
    "<S> it is this very selectivity , which makes the whole lsda+u machinery work , by mimicking the suppression of occupation number fluctuations due to correlations . in the same way as </S>",
    "<S> the hubbard band split is not attainable in lsda , the anisotropy effects are largely suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression is nicely confirmed by the observation of the vanishing energy difference between the two ls solutions as described above .    with increasing pressure the kinetic energy gain becomes more and more competitive with the exchange energy due more to the increasing crystal field splitting than to the bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> this competition usually leads to a ( partial ) collapse of the magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> lsda calculations give a moment of about 1.5 @xmath13 at our transition pressure , which is far from the hs value of 5 @xmath13 thus clearly showing that at the transition pressure first hund s rule is strongly suppressed . in the lsda+u method , </S>",
    "<S> the isotropic term forces the hs solution to have full spin - moment , while the ls solution allows a larger gain in kinetic energy , hence bringing along a transition from hs to ls at some pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy contribution of lsda+u is zero for the hs state and negative for the flipped ls state . </S>",
    "<S> this will further lower the energy of the flipped ls state against the hs state , resulting in a lower transition pressure . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this anisotropy contribution is smaller for a non spin - flipped solution , which rules out this solution . </S>",
    "<S> since the anisotropy term offers a way to keep a sizable amount of magnetic exchange energy , while gaining kinetic energy , it is this `` unusual '' state , which is realized after the transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we have described here how lsda+u energies for mno under pressure predict an unexpected mode of collapse of the mn moment at zero temperature : each of the @xmath10 orbitals remains polarized , and an s=5/2 to s=1/2 reduction arises from a simple spin - flip of the symmetry - determined @xmath45 doublet that has the strongest overlap with neighboring o @xmath20 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> this s=1/2 moment in the high pressure phase is consistent with the interpretation of xray emission data by rueff _ et al._@xcite ; yoo _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ were less specific about the value of the ( clearly small ) high pressure moment but presumed total collapse . </S>",
    "<S> the partial spin - flip collapse obtained here occurs in both the b1 ( rocksalt ) and b8 ( nias ) structures , calculated by two different codes , and occurs at similar volumes .    </S>",
    "<S> the transition we find is first - order and insulator - to - insulator , both of which insinuate the smallness of fluctuation effects and make the lsda+u approach an appropriate one . </S>",
    "<S> due to the imprecisely known values of @xmath1 and @xmath31 there is an associated uncertainty for the calculated equation of state , which depends on the values chosen . </S>",
    "<S> the functional dependence of these interaction energies ( @xmath1 , @xmath31 ) on the density is not known and we have neglected the volume dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the wien2k code@xcite includes a constrained lsda algorithm that enables calculation of @xmath1 , resulting in a value of 6.5 ev for both for the equilibrium volume and close to the transition . to identify the range of variation </S>",
    "<S> , we performed eos calculations for various values of @xmath1 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting transition pressures are depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pcuj ] .    </S>",
    "<S> as should be expected from the importance of the correlation corrections , the transition pressure @xmath83 is quite dependent on the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for all values of @xmath1 , @xmath84 decreases with increasing @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the strong variation confirms our analysis above , which identified the anisotropy ( proportional to @xmath31 ) as crucial in determining the ground state at a given volume . </S>",
    "<S> the energy separation of the hs and ls curves decreases with @xmath31 , and this change decreases the transition pressure ( the shape dependence of the energy curves on @xmath31 is minor ) . on the other hand , the potential matrix element effects ( which shift the corresponding eigenvalues ) tend to increase the hubbard splitting with increasing @xmath1 , which moves to stabilize the hs solution against the ls solution and leads to a monotonic increase of @xmath84 with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for reasonable values of @xmath31=0.61 ev , the dependence on @xmath1 lessens compared to stronger variation for unreasonably small values of @xmath31 . the very much to large transition pressure for @xmath85 ev compared to experiment is a strong argument that the anisotropy effects are not sufficiently described by the lsda part of the functional and hence have to be included in an orbital selective manner .    </S>",
    "<S> although the occupation number fluctuations at this transition should not be a big factor , as the volume is reduced and the bandwidth increases , these fluctuations will tend to increase . </S>",
    "<S> the effect can be modeled by adopting a smaller @xmath1 than the ambient pressure value ; hence the value of 5.5 ev that was used for most results presented here becomes justified . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the value of @xmath31 is only weakly screened by the environment , and it is sensible to chose a volume - independent value that resembles the atomic / ionic situation , where one usually finds @xmath31=0.71 ev for transition metals . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , the calculated transition pressures vary between 100 and 170 gpa for a reasonable choice of @xmath31 , which is quite satisfactory given the uncertainties of the lsda+u approach . </S>",
    "<S> one should also keep in mind that the zero temperature transition is expected to occur at a higher pressure than at room temperature .    </S>",
