    "recently , analysis of the empirical data from internet - relayed - chats ( irc ) revealed that the self - organized dynamics of emotional messages exchanged between users may lead to social networking and recognizable collective behaviors .",
    "in particular , the empirical data from ` ubuntu ` chat channel have been analysed as a complex dynamical system @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized that long - term associations among users occur as a specific kind of online social network , in which both the type of messages exchanged in user - to - user communications and their emotional contents play a role @xcite .",
    "apart from human users , different types of web bots are often available on the channel , for example , to provide information ( in terms of ready messages ) upon user s request . technically , chat bots with different features can be implemented . in the current technology developments , it is tempting to use the chat bots as mood modifiers in online chat systems @xcite , although their potentials to promote collective effects are currently not well understood . from the practical point of view , recent developments in the quantitative investigation of emotions @xcite and methods of emotion detection from a written text @xcite , the emotion of the added bot in a chat channel can be quantitatively defined .",
    "practical implementation , i.e. , creating the body of the messages which involve a specified emotion , is also technically feasible @xcite . on the other hand , mechanisms that bots can utilize to achieve their goals , as well as quantitative measures of bot s impact on users , depending on the properties of the bot and the actual parameters of the system ,",
    "make more difficult part of the problem .",
    "owing to the self - organized dynamics and appearance of network of connections , we assume that particular actions of a bot may propagate on that network and affect the course of these nonlinear processes , thus possibly altering the global state of the system .",
    "however , complete understanding of the mechanisms calls for appropriate theoretical modeling and analysis .    in this work ,",
    "we use agent - based modeling to study self - organization in the dynamics of chat that bots may utilize to shape the collective mood of users .",
    "we propose a model in which the emotional agents @xcite , representing users , are interacting among each other and with a bot of specified characteristics .",
    "bots that we introduce have several features , which make them qualitatively similar with other agents .",
    "specifically , bots are inclined to direct communications , they can be picked - up by agents for conversation , and they have an emotional state which corresponds to a commonly recognized emotion , according to russell s model of affect @xcite . moreover , following the universal picture of human dynamics on the web with characteristic delay of action ( interactivity time ) @xcite , our bots also assume a nontrivial interactivity time @xmath0 for their actions .",
    "note that , apart from these `` human - like '' attributes , the bots follow some action rules which differ form ordinary agents ( see details in sec .  [ sec - implementation ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of agent s chats consists of exchanging emotional messages on a network , which itself evolves by these chats . by performing numerical simulations of the model for a set of control parameters which are inferred from an empirical chat system ,",
    "we compute several quantitative measures of agent s collective behaviors .",
    "specifically , we determine persistence in the time series of emotional messages by detrended fractal analysis . further indicators of collective dynamics are determined from the power spectral density of these time series and the avalanches of emotional messages .",
    "then we demonstrate how these quantitative measures are changed when a bot of given emotional function is added to the system and identify the parameters that can adjust the bot performance .",
    "we consider bots with positive and negative emotional impact as well as the bots that can alternate between specified emotional states .",
    "we compare the effectiveness of these bots by quantifying their impact on agents , and examine the nature of collective states that they provoke among the agents .    in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] we describe the model and provide details of numerical implementation and the control parameters .",
    "results of the simulations in the absence of emotional bots are given in sec .",
    "[ sec - soc ] , where the quantitative measures of self - organized dynamics are computed . in sec .",
    "[ sec - roboteffects ] the system is simulated in the presence of a bot with predefined positive / negative emotion valence as well as the bots that alternate between two emotional states .",
    "section  [ sec - conclusion ] contains a brief summary of the results and analysis .",
    "we introduce an agent - based model in which agents stand for users with their attributes , which are important for the dynamics .",
    "one of the agents is identified as a bot , which may have different properties , depending on its actual task .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of the model maintaining each particular message with its emotional contents , source and recipient agent , and time of the creation",
    ". then we analyse the simulated sequence of messages to extract the quantitative measures of agent s collective behaviors  temporal correlations and fractal properties of the time series and clustering of events ( avalanches ) with emotional messages . in this section",
    ", we describe the mathematical structure of the model and its numerical implementation.we also identify the control parameters of the dynamics and determine several parameters from the empirical dataset of irc ` ubuntu ` channel .    in analogy to real chat channel , `",

    "@xcite ) , the agents in our model interact via posting _ messages _ on the channel .",
    "occasionally , with a probability @xmath1 , the posted message is directed to another agent known by its unique i d .",
    "thus , the agent - to - agent interactions lead to an evolving network of agents , which are interlinked by the exchanged messages .",
    "in contrast to the bipartite network in the dynamics on blogs @xcite , in the irc chats the agent - to - agent communications results in a _ directed monopartite network with weighted links_. on this network , each agent has specific neighborhood , on which current connections are reflecting its activity as well as the activity of the connected neighbour agents in the preceding period .",
    "the network evolves by the addition of new agents and/or new links among existing agents .",
    "network evolution as well as the activity of neighbouring agents may affect the agent s emotional state , i.e. , its emotional _ arousal _",
    ", @xmath2 , and _ valence _ , @xmath3",
    ". the elevated arousal may trigger agent s action  posting a new message that carries its current emotion .",
    "the precise dynamical rules are motivated by real chat channels and are resulting in the appropriate mathematical structure of the model , to be described below .",
    "messages received within a given time window @xmath4 by the agent @xmath5 from its neighbours on the ( evolving ) network give rise of the influence fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which can modify agent s arousal and valence , respectively ( see equations below ) .",
    "thus , these fields are individual properties of each agent and depend on time and actual events in the agent s neighborhood on the network .",
    "besides , all recent messages posted on the channel contribute to the common fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which may affect all agents .    for the agent - based modeling of chats in the presence of web bots , we consider the following attributes of the agent ( minimum requirements for modeling web users are discussed in ref .",

    "we also specify the probability @xmath15 for the agent s preference towards identified recipient of its message , compared to writing the message on the channel , where it can be seen by all active agents . by choosing these two distributions from the same empirical dataset , we _",
    "implicitly _ fix the profile of each agent .",
    "other approaches are considered in the literature , e.g. , introducing fuzzy agents with dynamical personality @xcite .",
    "the remaining attributes of the agent in ( [ eq - agent - bot ] ) are dynamically changing with simulation time . in our model ,",
    "the dynamical variables of agent s emotional state , arousal @xmath16 and valence @xmath17 , fluctuate under the influence of other agents and bot . during the chat process , each agent developes over time personal connections on the network .",
    "these are represented by the lists of incoming and outgoing links @xmath18 , along which the agent sent and received messages until time @xmath19 .",
    "updated number of messages posted by the agent @xmath20 , as well as its lists of links and the activity _ status _ are dynamically changing in the process of chats .",
    "the delay times @xmath21 is derived from the appropriate distribution whenever it is required by the dynamic rules ( see algorithm  [ alg : abmchatswithrobotbot ] ) .",
    "as it will be evident in the implementation of the model , the distinction between a regular agent and bot is manifested in the dynamics of their emotional states , rules of their actions , and the parameters that control their actions .",
    "values of the dynamically varying fields @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are determined considering the emotional arousal and valence in _ recently posted _ messages , specifically the messages posted in the time window @xmath24 .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is decided according to the pace of events on the channel , for instance in the ` ubuntu ` channel @xmath25 minutes provides that in the average 10 messages are in this window .",
    "denoting the message @xmath26 creation time by @xmath27 , the arousal and the valence affecting fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 of agent @xmath5 are determined from all recent messages directed to @xmath5 , as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the arousal of the message arriving along the link @xmath32 , and @xmath33 here , the summation is over the messages from the list @xmath34 of agent s @xmath5 incoming links . @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the number of the messages within the considered time window which are directed to @xmath5 and convey positive and negative emotion valence , respectively .",
    "the corresponding components of the common fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 are computed in a similar way , but considering the list of all recent messages on the channel , @xmath40 , including those that are not addressed to any particular agent : @xmath41 and @xmath42 here , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the number of positive and negative messages appearing on the channel within the current time window while @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    similar as in the model of blogging dynamics @xcite and",
    "dialogs in online social networks @xcite , we assume that the individual emotional state of each agent on the chat network can be described by two nonlinear maps for the variables @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] , which are appropriately coupled with the above introduced environmental fields .",
    "the rationale is that the arousal is an intensive variable , which can cause agent s action . whereas , the positive and the negative valence have different dynamics .",
    "consequently , an attractive fixed point in the negative as well as in the positive valence region is expected . in the absence of psychology based mathematical model of emotion dynamics",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the maps which fulfill these formal requirements include higher - order polynomial nonlinearities , specifically : @xmath49 @xmath50 here , the index @xmath51 indicates agent identity and @xmath19 is the time binn , which in the simulations corresponds to one minute of real time as explained in [ sec - implementation ] .",
    "the relaxation with rate @xmath52 is executed systematically . whereas , the nonlinear terms are added according to the rules , when the agent s interactivity time @xmath21 expires .",

    "the distribution @xmath14 , @xmath62 as well as the delay time distributions are inferred from the same empirical dataset .",
    "( in this way , we capture potential hidden correlations between different parameters . ) on the other hand , the agent s delay time to an action , @xmath21 , is dynamically driven from the distribution @xmath63 after each completed action and is systematically updated ( decreased ) until the condition for action @xmath64 is satisfied .    designing bots with `` human - like '' characteristics ,",

    "we are interested in understanding potentials of emotional bots to promote collective reaction among interacting agents with dominant positive or negative emotion , and in quantifying the effectiveness of bots .",
    "therefore , we first consider two bots with fixed emotion , corresponding to common emotions known as `` joy '' and `` misery '' , respectively . according to the russell s two - dimensional circumplex model @xcite , these are two emotions with opposite valence and similar arousal .",

    "[ fig - ts - altr ] shows , when the ` joybot - q04 ` is present , the excess positive charge is building quite efficiently .",
    "likewise , the excess negative charge builds when the ` misbot - q04 ` is active .",
    "comparison of the slopes of these two curves , + 0.808 and -0.714 , indicates that the positive bot is a bit more effective than the negative one .",
    "note that all other parameters of the system as well as the sequence of random numbers are the same .",
    "when the bot is alternating , starting from the negative episode , the induced total charge of agent s emotional messages also oscillates with the same period .",
    "the respective sections of the @xmath127 curve have the same slopes as the case with negative / positive bots . whereas , the corresponding slopes are smaller , resulting in a shallow curve in the case @xmath102 .",
    "this indicates that the alternating bot for @xmath102 is less effective , compared with the one for @xmath101 . owing to slight asymmetry of the charge signal",
    ", the overall curve is slowly shifting towards positive charge .",
    "further quantitative measures of the effectiveness of alternating bots can be inferred from the analysis of _ persistence _ of the charge fluctuations and _ avalanches of emotional messages _ . in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig - ts - altr ] ( bottom panel ) , a larger hurst exponent @xmath128 is found for the fluctuations of charge time series when the bot s effects are stronger ( @xmath101 ) as compared with the case when the bot s messages are not as much recognized by the agents ( @xmath102 ) . in the latter case",
    ", we find hurst exponent @xmath129 in the time window @xmath130 $ ] , while in the first @xmath131 is found and applies in the area @xmath132 $ ] below the bot - induced periodicity ( n=4320 ) .",
    "the activity of the alternating - mood bots tends to enhance long - range correlations in the system .",
    "appart form the persistence of the charge fluctuations this tendency can be also seen in the altered nature of avalanches . in fig .",
    "[ fig - avalanches - compare]a , the distributions of avalanche sizes induced by the bot of the same polarity : positive emotion avalanches induced by the behavior of ` joybot - q04 ` and negative - emotion avalanches in the presence of ` misbot - q04 ` with the same @xmath67 parameter .",
    "generally , larger positive avalanches can be observed in the presence of positive bot , than negative - emotion avalanches when the negative bot is available .",
    "+    the presence of alternating bots enhances fluctuations in the agent s emotions , as already mentioned . here , in fig .",
    "[ fig - avalanches - compare]b we show that the structure of emotional avalanches is also altered , compared with the fixed - emotion bots .",
    "the power - law distributions with the universal exponent @xmath133 is found both for positive and negative emotion avalanches in the presence of the alternating bots .",
    "when the alternating bot is more effective , i.e. , for @xmath101 , we find increased probability of very large avalanches , compared with @xmath102 .    apart from the parameter @xmath67 , which measures how bot s messages are taken into account in the common influence fields , bot s activity can be tuned by varying its delay time @xmath134 . in the present work , the characteristic delay of bots @xmath135 , cf .",
    "distribution @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig - parameters ] . according to the dynamic rules ,",
    "the impact of bot generally depends on the activity of the agents . having the simulated data , we can estimate bot s impact as follows : @xmath136q \\ , \\label{eq - bot - rate}\\ ] ] where the average number of active agents @xmath137 affects the likelihood that bot is picked up for discussion .",
    "conversely , increased activity of bot may induce a larger number of active agents . in the simulated data with two alternating bots , we have @xmath138 2.478 and 1.441 , corresponding to @xmath1390.4 and 0.1 .",
    "thus , respective bot s activity rates are estimated as @xmath140 0.012 and 0.004 .",
    "we have introduced an agent - based model of online chats with the presence of emotional bots .",
    "the properties of the agents and the model rules are motivated by user dynamics observed @xcite in the analysis of empirical data in irc ` ubuntu ` channel .",
    "several control parameters of the model are inferred by analysis of the same empirical data , and the system is driven by the empirical time series  arrival of new users ( agents ) .",
    "first , by shutting down the bots , we have analysed the underlying stochastic process of emotional interactions among the agents . systematic analysis of the simulated time series of agent s activity in the absence of bots reveals the self - organized nature of the dynamics .",
    "several quantitative measures that we determine imply the fractal gaussian - noise driven processes .",
    "the persistent fluctuations , correlations in the time series and power - law avalanches carrying positive and negative emotion messages are determined as quantitative characteristics of collective behaviors of agents .",
    "the observed temporal correlations , as well as the emergence of the network of agents , share striking similarity with the empirical system @xcite .    furthermore , by animating emotional bots with `` human - like '' characteristics",
    ", we have shown that the character of the underlying fractal process is altered , enabling bot s impact on collective emotional behaviors of agents .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that bots with fixed emotional state ( opposite emotion `` joy '' and `` misery '' are analysed ) , interacting with a certain number of agents , induce dominant emotional valence among the agents in the whole system .",
    "detailed study of the persistence , correlations and clustering ( avalanche ) of emotional messages of agents , suggests that bot s activity induces changes in the quantitative measures of the process and reduction of the phase space .",
    "based on the self - organized nature of the process , these mechanisms guarantee reliable effects of bots activity . quantitative measures of bot s impact depend on several parameters of bots and the interacting agents . for the set of parameters used in our simulations , we find that , in general , processes building positive emotional states are more effective than the ones with negative collective response",
    ".    moreover , our simulations revealed that the presence of bots which are alternating between positive and negative mood enhances fluctuations and further changes temporal correlations in the emotional messages at the level of the whole system .",
    "when the mood - alternating bot is extremely effective , as the case of ` altbot - q04 ` , the fractal characteristics of the process approach the ones of flicker noise and the avalanches resembling self - organized critical behavior .",
    "these theoretical aspects , as well as design of bots with different functions , are left for future work .",
