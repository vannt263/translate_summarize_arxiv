    "the structure of infrared singularities of feynman graphs is very well understood at one loop level @xcite@xcite .",
    "these infrared singularities appear due to the massless particles present in the theory .",
    "we may therefore call them `` mass singularities '' as well . in literature",
    "these mass singularities are classified as soft and collinear singularities .",
    "the appearance of soft singularity in loop diagrams is associated with the exchange of massless particles between two on - shell particles . on the other hand ,",
    "splitting of a massless external particle into two massless internal particles of a loop diagram gives rise to collinear singularity .",
    "in fact , these are only the necessary conditions for a loop diagram to have soft or collinear divergence .",
    "actual singularities appear as any of the momenta of internal lines , in these configurations , vanishes ( soft divergence ) or it becomes parallel to one of it s neighboring external legs ( collinear divergence ) .",
    "both of these singularities are logarithmic in @xmath0 dimensions . + a soft singular configuration of loop diagrams , with massless external as well as internal particles , contains two collinear configurations and this situation leads to the possibility of overlapping of soft and collinear singularities .",
    "the overlapping singularity is also logarithmic in nature . in dimensional",
    "regularization ( @xmath1 ) , ir divergence of a loop integral appears as @xmath2 poles .",
    "the ir divergent scalar one loop integrals have generic form given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are complex functions of kinematic invariants @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 term corresponds to the overlapping of soft and collinear divergence .",
    "it should be obvious that unlike in the case of uv singularity , tensor integrals do not spoil the ( logarithmic ) structure of ir divergence of scalar integrals .",
    "in ref.@xcite an expression to determine @xmath6 and @xmath7 for a general @xmath8-point one loop tensor integral is obtained .",
    "a very naive way of understanding these mass singularities at one loop can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ there are many scattering processes which , at one loop , proceed via fermion loop diagrams .",
    "in fact some of these scattering processes are possible only at one loop _",
    "i.e. _ there is no tree level diagram for them .",
    "a well known standard example is of four photon interaction in qed .",
    "though these fermions in the loop are not exactly massless , at very high energies their masses can be neglected . as discussed above ,",
    "working in vanishing fermion mass limit may lead to mass singularities . in this case",
    ", the singularities would show up as large - logs of vanishing fermion masses .",
    "this is another way of regularizing ir singularities , often called `` mass regularization '' in literature . in mass regularization , the generic form of fermion loop diagrams is , @xmath9 . in this form",
    ", @xmath10 piece refers to overlapping singularity .",
    "+ in the following we show that for a given fermion loop diagram , @xmath11 , that is , it is ir finite .",
    "the proof is obvious for the case of massive fermions in the loop .",
    "also , if all the external legs are massive , the diagram would be ir finite even for massless fermions in the loop .",
    "so we need to consider only those fermion loop diagrams in which fermions are massless or more correctly their masses can be neglected and at least one external leg is massless .",
    "in general we can have massless scalars , gauge bosons and gravitons attached to the fermion loop",
    ". with one massless external particle we expect only collinear singularity while for two adjacent external massless particles , soft and collinear and their overlap may develop .",
    "ir finiteness of a fermion loop diagram can be shown by showing it s soft finiteness and collinear finiteness .",
    "this automatically takes care of it s finiteness in overlapping regions . at one loop",
    "the general fermion loop integral has following form , fig.[fig : fermionloop ] .    @xmath12        where @xmath13 s are vertex factors for a given massless external particle attached to the fermion loop . from momentum conservation at each vertex",
    "it is clear that @xmath14 etc .",
    "the feynman rules for needed vertices are given in fig.[fig : feynrules ] .",
    "factors of ` @xmath15 ' and coupling constants etc . are dropped in writing those rules , for simplification .",
    "feynman rules for graviton - fermion interaction is derived in @xcite .",
    "we did not consider two graviton - fermion vertex since it does not correspond to soft or collinear configuration described above .",
    "we closely follow the analysis of ir singular structure of one loop diagrams , given in ref.@xcite .",
    "+ first we would like to see the behavior of this integral as any of the internal lines becomes soft _",
    "i.e. _ it s momentum vanishes . without loss of generality",
    "we consider softness of @xmath16 and take @xmath17 .",
    "we see that in the limit @xmath18 , the denominators which vanish in general are , @xmath19 where we have used on mass - shell conditions for @xmath20 and @xmath21 . neglecting @xmath22 with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eq.(2 ) , we see that the integral ( 1 ) , in soft limit , behaves as    @xmath25    and it vanishes in @xmath0 dimensions . thus each fermion loop diagram is soft finite , independent of kind of massless external particles attached to it .",
    "we should mention here that soft finiteness of fermion loop diagrams is indirectly shown by kinoshita in @xcite .",
    "+   +        next we consider the behavior of fermion loop integral in collinear region .",
    "we take @xmath26 , ( @xmath27 as it corresponds to softness of @xmath16 and @xmath28 respectively ) with @xmath29 .",
    "note that in @xmath30 limit , this condition implies collinearity of @xmath16 with @xmath21 . in this collinear limit",
    "only vanishing denominators are @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus the integral in eq .",
    "( 1 ) reads , @xmath33 we need to make the above substitution for @xmath16 in @xmath13 s also , in case they depend on the loop momentum _",
    "e.g. _ in graviton - fermion vertex .",
    "since the vertex factors are different for different kind of external particles , we will consider three separate cases to see the behavior of fermion loop integral in collinear limit . referring to feynman rules in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynrules ] , we see + ( i ) _ for scalars _ , @xmath34 , therefore the integral in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is    @xmath35    \\(ii ) _ for vector bosons _",
    ", @xmath36 @xmath37 is the polarization vector of the gauge boson with momentum @xmath21 . using transversality and on - shell condition for vector boson",
    ", we see that the    @xmath38    and therefore the fermion loop integral in collinear limit , eq .",
    "( 4 ) , vanishes .",
    "finally + ( iii ) _ for gravitons _ , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is polarization tensor for graviton of momentum @xmath21 .",
    "it has following well known properties ,    @xmath41    using these properties the vertex factor in eq .",
    "( 8) becomes @xmath42 in the collinear limit , taken above , it is @xmath43 due to transverse condition",
    ". therefore the fermion loop diagram with external gravitons , like the cases of scalars and vector bosons , is also collinear finite . combining all the above results of this section we see that a general fermion loop diagram is soft as well as collinear finite .",
    "in the above , we have shown that the most general possible fermion loop diagram is ir finite .",
    "we have seen that the soft finiteness of fermion loop diagrams follows from simple power counting in vanishing loop momentum while their collinear finiteness results , utilizing various properties of massless external particles attached to the loop .",
    "the result holds even for axial coupling of external particles with the fermion . though we have not considered any flavor change in the loop , it should be clear from above analysis that our result remains true for any possible flavor changing interaction vertex in the loop",
    ". we would also like to emphasize that this result is important from the point of view of making numerical checks on codes for calculating fermion loop diagrams .",
    "the author would like to thank pankaj agrawal for his valuable comments on generalizing the result ."
