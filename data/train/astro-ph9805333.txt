    "the gamma - ray burst  was detected on 1998 march 29.1559 ut by the gamma - ray burst monitor on the bepposax satellite and localized to an error circle of 3  radius by the wide field camera ( frontera et al .",
    "the burst lasted a total of 55 s and was bright  a fluence of 5@xmath0 erg @xmath1 in the range 50300 kev was measured by the burst and transient experiment on board the compton gamma ray observatory satellite ( briggs et al .",

    "the burst position was further constrained by a timing annulus derived between the ulysses and bepposax satellites ( hurley et al .",
    "1998 ) .    a power law decay in the x - ray flux",
    ", s@xmath2 appears to be a universal signature of the x - ray afterglows ; @xmath3 ranges from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( e.g. costa et al .",
    "1997 , piro et al .",
    "this phenomenon of long - lived post - burst emission ",
    "is nicely explained by grb models known as fireballs , in which relativistically expanding debris shells interact with a surrounding medium and accelerate a power law distribution of particles ( mszros & rees 1997 ) . as the fireball decelerates the peak of the emitted radiation shifts in time to lower energies producing power law decays in the x - ray , optical and radio bands ( e.g. waxman 1997a , sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "the successful detections at x - ray wavelengths have not been matched by equal numbers of afterglows at optical wavelengths .",
    "only 4 of the @xmath610 grbs with x - ray afterglows have detected optical afterglows ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 , bond et al .",
    "1997 , halpern et al .",
    "1998 , groot et al .  1998 ) .",
    "grb970828 is one notable non - detection ; it exhibited a typical x - ray decay ( murakami et al .",
    "1998 ) , yet no optical transient was associated with this burst to a limit 100 times lower than that of the optical afterglow from grb970508 ( odewahn et al .",
    "several authors have attempted to explain the diversity of afterglow behavior by invoking more complex fireball models ( mszros , rees , & wijers 1998 , panaitescu , mszros , & rees 1998 ) , including such effects as non - isotropic expansion , non - uniform distributions of external media , and a time dependence in the radiative efficiency of the shock .",
    "paczyski ( 1998 ) suggested that foreground extinction could account for the absence of optical afterglows from grbs .",
    "indeed , modest extinction has been inferred for the optical afterglow from grb971214 ( reichart 1998 , halpern et al .",
    "1998 , ramaprakash et al .  1998 ) .",
    "a logical extension of this extinction hypothesis is that , in some cases , the afterglow may be seen in the radio or infrared bands but not in the optical .",
    "in this paper we report the detection of a variable radio source in the reduced error circle of  and argue that it is the radio afterglow from an optically obscured burst .",
    "the first radio observations at 8 ghz with the very large array ( vla ) began on 1998 march 30.212 ut . absolute flux calibration was derived from short observations of 3c286 in the standard fashion , or by using j0713 + 438 which also has a very stable flux density ( taylor , readhead & pearson 1996 ) .",
    "phase calibration was derived from observations of the nearby calibrators j0653 + 370 or j0713 + 438 .",
    "continuum observations in the 3  mm band were made with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) six element array between 1998 april 6 and 1998 april 11 .",
    "a total of four runs , each with approximately 6  hours of on - source time , were obtained under good conditions .",
    "projected baselines ranged from 30 to 120  m. two 1  ghz bandwidth continuum channels with central frequencies of 88.6 and 91.6 ghz were observed simultaneously in the upper and lower side bands .",
    "flux calibration was derived using 3c273 with an absolute uncertainty of @xmath7% .",
    "we used j0552@xmath8398 and j0646@xmath8448 for phase calibration .",
    "on 1998 april 1 ( see table 1 ) , a modestly bright radio source ,   lying within the nfi error circle was detected .",
    "the precise position of this radio source is @xmath9(j2000 )  =  07@xmath1002@xmath11380217 , @xmath3(j2000 )  =  38@xmath1250@xmath1344017 with an uncertainty of 0.05 arcsec in each coordinate .",
    "re - inspection of the march 30 observation revealed a 3@xmath14 detection at the location of .",
    "the flux density of the source dramatically decreased on april 2 ( table 1 ) . this clear variability led us to announce that  was potentially a radio afterglow of   ( taylor  1998 ) .",
    "the source continued to exhibit variability as can be seen from figure 1 .",
    "the modulation index ( defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean ) for the period 1998 march 30  april 20 is 0.43 at 8.3 ghz and 0.63 at 4.9 ghz .",
    "beginning approximately three weeks after the initial gamma - ray burst the modulation in the flux density decreased ( modulation index from april 21.9130.10 is 0.30 and 0.39 at 8.3 and 4.9 ghz respectively ) .",
    "perhaps the best evidence that the amplitude of the rapid flux variations has subsided is seen in the distribution of spectral indices in table 1 . between april 6 and april 21 @xmath9 varies from 0.37 to 2.96 , whereas after this time @xmath15 , suggesting that the underlying intrinsic spectrum has been revealed .",
    "is unresolved in all our observations .",
    "the dataset of 1998 april 1 with its high signal - to - noise ratio allowed us to place an upper limit on the angular size of  of @xmath1650 milliarcseconds .",
    "based on observations on april 19.00 the linear polarization of   is less than 21% ( 2@xmath14 ) at 8.3 ghz .    a summary of the ovro results at 90  ghz is presented in table 2 . in the first two runs ,",
    "there were marginal ( @xmath17 ) detections of a source within 2  of .",
    "the rms in the sum of the first three days is 0.45 mjy @xmath18 .",
    "a source with a peak flux of 1.45 mjy is found within 0.4  of .",
    "smith & tilanus ( 1998 ) reported detections of a radio source coincident with  using the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) at 350 ghz .",
    "preliminary flux densities , on april 5.2 , 6.2 and 7.2 ut were reported as 5@xmath191.5 mjy , 4@xmath191.2 mjy , and 2@xmath190.8 mjy , respectively . combining the first two nights smith & tilanus claim a mean flux density of 4.5@xmath191 mjy . within the stated uncertainties , the jcmt source decayed very rapidly or the measurements errors are larger than reported . in view of this somewhat confusing picture",
    ", we will restrict the discussion below to measurements obtained from our vla and ovro efforts .    in figure 2 we plot the time - averaged flux densities for the .",
    "a linear least squares fit gives a spectral index @xmath20 + 0.9 ( where @xmath9 is defined by s@xmath21 ) .",
    "closer inspection shows that while the radio spectrum rises with increasing frequency , @xmath9 flattens , with @xmath9=1.7 between 4.9 and 8.3 ghz , and @xmath9=0.8 from 15 ghz to 90 ghz .",
    "we then fit the predicted @xmath22 power - law spectrum ( waxman 1997b ) , attenuated by a synchrotron self - absorption component of the form ( 1 @xmath23 e@xmath24)/@xmath25 where @xmath26 . as we discuss in  4.2 , fig .",
    "2 is sufficient to illustrate that a @xmath22 spectrum is not inconsistent with the data at high frequencies and that the synchrotron self - absorption turnover frequency ( where @xmath27 ) is close to 13 ghz .",
    "the extrapolated flux density at 350 ghz for this fit is 1.7 mjy .",
    "what , then , is the nature of this compact , time - variable centimeter radio source ?",
    "the probability of finding an unrelated radio source at 8.3 ghz in the nfi error circle is small , 8% , but it is not negligible ( windhorst et al .",
    ". however , the properties of   are at odds with the majority of sub - millijansky radio sources at 510 ghz , which have flat spectral indices ( @xmath28 ) , and are extended , ( @xmath29=2.6 ) ( windhorst et al .  1995 , richards et al .",
    "optically they are usually identified with normal nearby spirals or disturbed , faint blue galaxies ( r@xmath30 ) whose radio emission is thought to originate from recent bursts of star formation .",
    "it is conceivable that  could be a member of that small fraction of the sub - mjy population that are identified with low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the statistics of agn flux density variability are poor at these low flux density levels ( see summary in frail 1998 ) . however , the variability for these sources is broad - band and not the chromatic variability seen in figure 1 .",
    "the properties of  most closely resemble that of the early - time behavior of the radio afterglow from the grb of 1997 may 8 ( frail et al .  1997 , taylor et al .",
    "1997 ) . like",
    ", the radio source vla  j065349.4 + 791619 was initially undetected at 1.43 ghz , exhibited large flux variations at 4.86 and 8.46 ghz ( frail et al .",
    "1997 ) , and had a rising spectrum toward higher frequencies ( shepherd et al .",
    "this marks only the second time a radio afterglow has been detected from a grb .",
    "however , unlike the case for grb , no clear optical signature was detected from the afterglow of . in the days",
    "prior to the report of the radio detection several groups initially reported the absence of any optical variability in the r - band in the range of r@xmath312023 ( guarnieri et al .",
    "1998 , klose , meusinger , & lehmann 1998 , djorgovski et al .",
    "following our announcement of the variable radio source ( taylor et al .",
    "1998 ) , we and others re - examined the optical and ir data at the precise sub - arcsecond position of the radio source .",
    "we identified a faint optical counterpart of  ( djorgovski et al .",
    "evidence for a decaying counterpart was then found and reported as follows : i - band ( klose 1998 ) , j - band ( cole et al .",
    "1998 ) , r - band ( palazzi et al .",
    "1998a ) , and k - band ( larkin et al .",
    "1998 , metzger 1998 ) .",
    "these observations provide ample confirmation that  is the radio afterglow from .",
    "in  1 we alluded to the fact that about half of the well - localized grbs appear not to have any associated optical transient .",
    "there are two solutions to this mystery ( 1 ) the afterglow decays rapidly in such grbs or ( 2 ) many grbs suffer from extinction .",
    "photoelectric attenuation at kev energies decreases as @xmath32 whereas optical extinction @xmath33 where @xmath34 is one or even larger .",
    "thus , a modest column density , say @xmath35 @xmath1 , in the host has little affect on the sax passband of 160 kev ( wide field camera and the narrow field instruments ) but can suppress the observed r - band flux by almost 5 mag . indeed",
    "the absence of detectable optical flux accompanying strong x - ray emission may simply be due to the strong redshift dependence of the suppression at observed optical wavelengths in comparison to the x  ray wavelengths , @xmath36 .",
    "the standard afterglow model of mszros & rees ( 1997 ) predicts that the peak flux density will be independent of frequency .",
    "our average 8.3 ghz flux density of 325 @xmath37jy from the period april 2130 implies a peak r - band magnitude @xmath6 17 , yet only 15 hours after the burst r was greater than 20 ( klose , meusinger , & lehmann 1998 ) . observations of very red colors for  show that , at least for this grb , dust extinction is the cause of the dim optical emission ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1998c , palazzi et al",
    ".  1998b ) .",
    "evidence for dust has been inferred in grb971214 ( reichart 1998 , halpern et al .",
    "1998 , ramaprakash et al .   1998 ) ; however , the inferred column density , while uncertain , is rather modest , @xmath38 mag . in the case of",
    ", the r - band extinction is higher , making the detection of the afterglow easier at ir wavelengths .",
    "if dust is indeed the main cause of optically dim grbs then we conclude that extinction is significant in at least half of the grbs . at face value",
    "this is not compatible with the currently popular model of coalescing neutron stars ( narayan , paczyski , & piran 1992 ) .",
    "such ns - ns binaries are expected to live long enough ( @xmath39 yr ) and acquire sufficiently high velocities to remove them from their high gas density birthplaces .",
    "an alternative model for grbs is the `` hypernova '' model ( woosley 1993 , paczyski 1998 ) , in which very massive stars produce a `` dirty '' fireball with @xmath6300 times the luminosity of a supernova . since such massive stars die young ( age @xmath40 yr )",
    ", a natural consequence of this model is that grbs should be associated with high density , dusty regions actively undergoing star formation .",
    "the large energies inferred for the @xmath41-ray burst and optical afterglow of grb971214 ( kulkarni et al .  1998 ; ramaprakash et al .",
    "1998 ) present a further challenge to the coalescing ns - ns models .",
    "the hypernova model is capable of producing a more energetic and long - lived afterglow via its `` dirty fireball '' than current ns - ns models which produce a `` clean fireball '' ( paczyski 1998 ) .",
    "taking cues from the radio afterglow of grb970508 we expect that the current chromatic intensity variations will die and be replaced by broad - band lower modulation - index scintillation .",
    "analyzing existing and future data in terms of diffractive and refractive scintillation will enable us to trace the angular evolution of the fireball ( frail  1997 , waxman , kulkarni , & frail 1997 ) .",
    "the character of the fluctuations from  are strikingly similar to grb970508 for which a size of 3 @xmath37arcsec was inferred ( goodman 1997 , frail et al .",
    "the angular size of  may be even smaller than this since it is at a lower galactic latitude ( @xmath42 vs 26.7@xmath12 ) and the quenching of scattering scales inversely with sin(@xmath43 ) ( goodman 1997 )",
    ".    when these flux modulations die down ( due to the fireball expansion ) the underlying spectrum is revealed . between 8.3 , 15 and 90 ghz",
    "the spectral slope @xmath9 is roughly consistent with the canonical 1/3 value expected for the low energy tail of the electron distribution ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , between 4.9 and 8.3 ghz a value of @xmath44 is suggested at late times ( see table 1 ) .",
    "a similar slope was seen for grb between 1.43 ghz and 4.86 ghz ( shepherd et al .",
    "1998 ) , and was attributed to synchrotron self - absorption ( katz & piran 1997 ) . again , as with grb970508 , we determine from this an angular size for  of a few @xmath37arcsec ( katz & piran 1997 ) . the higher self - absorption frequency inferred for",
    "suggests that it is more compact than grb , or in a denser environment , or that there exists an additional component of low energy electrons ( waxman 1997b ) that increase the opacity at radio wavelengths . in keeping with what has been observed from grb970508 and model predictions ,",
    "the radio spectrum should evolve in time as the synchrotron peak shifts to lower energies .",
