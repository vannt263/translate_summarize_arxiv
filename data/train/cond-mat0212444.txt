    "twenty years ago , using physics to describe political or social behavior was a very odd approach . among very scarce attempts , one paper was calling on to the creation of a new field under the name of  sociophysics \" @xcite .",
    "it stayed without real continuation . only in the last years",
    "did physicists start to get involved along this line of research @xcite . among various subjects",
    "@xcite , we can cite voting process @xcite , group decision making @xcite , competing opinion spreading @xcite , and very recently international terrorism @xcite .",
    "in this paper we adress the question of spontaneous coalition forming within military alliances among a set of independant countries @xcite .",
    "a model is built from the complexe physics of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "while coalitions are found to form spontaneously , they are unstable .",
    "it is only the construction of extra - territory macro organizations which are able to produce stable alliances .",
    "the following of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the second part contains the presentation of the model .",
    "basic features of the dynamics of spontaneous froming bimodal coalitions are outlined .",
    "the building of extra - territory coaltions is described in section 3 .",
    "the cold war situation is then analysed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the situation in which only one world coalition is active .",
    "a new explanation is given in section 6 to eastern european instabilities following the warsaw pact dissolution as well as to western european stability .",
    "some hints are also obtained on how to stabilize these eastern europe instabilities .",
    "last section contains some concluding remarks .",
    "we start from a group of @xmath0 independant countries @xcite . from historical , cultural and economic experience , bilateral propensities @xmath1 have emerged between pairs of countries @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "they are either favoring cooperation @xmath4 , conflict @xmath5 or ignorance @xmath6 .",
    "each propensity @xmath1 depends solely on the pair @xmath7 itself .",
    "propensities @xmath1 are local and independant frozen bonds . respective intensities may vary for each pair of countries but are always symmetric , i.e. , @xmath8 .    from the well known saying  the enemy of an enemy is a friend \" we get the existence of only two competing coalitions .",
    "they are denoted respectively by a and b. then each country has the choice to be in either one of two coalitions . a variable @xmath9 where index i runs from 1 to n , signals the @xmath2 actual belonging with @xmath10 for alliance a and @xmath11 for alliance b. from bimodal symmetry all",
    "a - members can turn to coalition b with a simultaneous flip of all b - members to coalition a.    given a pair of countries @xmath12 their respective alignment is readily expressed through the product @xmath13 .",
    "the product is @xmath14 when @xmath2 and @xmath3 belong to the same coalition and @xmath15 otherwise . the associated  cost \" between the countries is measured by the quantity @xmath16 where @xmath17 accounts for the amplitude of exchange which results from their respective geopolitical history and localization .",
    "here factorisation over @xmath2 and @xmath3 is not possible since we are dealing with competing bonds @xcite .",
    "it makes teh problem very hard to solve analytically .",
    "given a configuration @xmath18 of countries distributed among coaltions a and b , for each nation @xmath2 we can measure its overall degree of conflict and cooperation with all others @xmath19 countries via the quantity , @xmath20 where the summation is taken over all other countries including @xmath2 itself with @xmath21 .",
    "the product @xmath22 then evaluates the  cost \" associated with country @xmath2 choice with respect to all other country choices .",
    "summing up all country individual",
    " cost \" yields , @xmath23 where the @xmath24 accounts for the double counting of pairs .",
    "cost \" measures indeed the level of global satisfaction from the whole country set .",
    "it can be recast as , @xmath25 where the sum runs over the @xmath26 pairs @xmath12 . at this stage",
    "it sounds reasonable to assume each country chooses its coalition in order to minimize its indivual cost . accordingly to make two cooperating countries @xmath4 in the same alliance , we put a minus sign in from of the expression of eq .",
    "( 3 ) to get , @xmath27 which is indeed the hamiltonian of an ising random bond magnetic system . there exist by symmetry @xmath28 distinct sets of alliances each country having 2 choices for coalition . starting from any initial configuration , the dynamics of the system is implemented by single country coalition flips .",
    "an country turns to the competing coalition only if the flip decreases its local cost .",
    "the system has reached its stable state once no more flip occurs . given @xmath29 ,",
    "the @xmath30 are thus obtained minimizing eq .",
    "since the system stable configuration minimizes the energy , we are from the physical viewpoint , at the temperature @xmath31 . in practise for any finite system the theory can tell which coalitions are possible . however , if several coalitions have the same energy , the system is unstable and flips continuously from one coalition set to another one at random and with no end .",
    "for instance , in the case of three conflicting nations like israel , syria and iraq , any possible alliance configuration leaves always someone unsatisfied .",
    "let us label them respectively by 1 , 2 , 3 and consider equal and negative exchange interactions @xmath32 with @xmath33 as shown in fig .",
    "the associated minimum of the energy is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "however this minimum value is realized for several possible and equivalent coalitions which are respectively ( a , b , a ) , ( b , a , a ) , ( a , a , b ) , ( b , a , b ) , ( a , b , b ) , and ( b , b , a ) . first three are identical to last ones by symmetry since here what matters is which countries are together within the same coalition .",
    "this peculiar property of a degenerate ground state makes the system unstable .",
    "there exists no one single stable configuration which is stable . some dynamics",
    "is shown in fig .",
    ". the system jumps continuously and at random between ( a , b , a ) , ( b , a , a ) and ( a , a , b ) .    to make the dynamics more explicit ,",
    "consider a given site @xmath2 .",
    "interactions with all others sites can be represented by a field , @xmath35 resulting in an energy contribution @xmath36 to the hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "( 6 ) is minimum for @xmath9 and @xmath38 having the same sign . for a given @xmath38",
    "there exists always a well defined coalition choice except for @xmath39 . in this case site @xmath2",
    ". then both coalitions are identical with respect to its local energy which stays equal to zero .",
    "an unstable site flips continuously with probability @xmath40 ( see fig . ( 1 ) ) .",
    "in parallel to the spontaneous emergence of unstable coalitions , some extra territory organizations have been set in the past to create alliances at a global world level . among the recent more powerfull ones stand nato and the former warsow pact .",
    "these alliances were set above the country level and produce economic and military exchanges .",
    "each country is then adjusting to its best interest with respect to these organisations . a variable @xmath41 accounts for each country @xmath2 natural belonging . for coalition",
    "a it is @xmath42 and @xmath43 for b. the value @xmath44 marks no apriori .",
    "these natural belongings are also induced by cultural and political history .",
    "exchanges generated by these coalitions produce additional pairwise propensities with amplitudes @xmath45 .",
    "sharing resources , informations , weapons is basically profitable when both countries are in the same alliance .",
    "however , being in opposite coalitions produces an equivalent loss .",
    "therefore a pair @xmath7 propensity is @xmath46 which can be positive , negative or zero to mark respective cooperation , conflict or ignorance .",
    "it is a site induced bond @xcite . adding it to the former bond propensity yields an overall pair propensity , @xmath47 between two countries @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    at this stage",
    "an additional variable @xmath48 is introduced to account for benefit from economic and military pressure attached to a given alignment .",
    "it is still @xmath49 for a and @xmath50 for b with @xmath51 in case of no pressure .",
    "the amplitude of this economical and military interest is measured by a local positive field @xmath52 which also accounts for the country size and its importance . at this stage , the sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 are independent .",
    "actual country choices to cooperate or to conflict result from the given set of above quantites .",
    "the associated total cost becomes , @xmath55    an illustration is given in fig .",
    "( 2 ) with above exemple of israel , syria and iraq labeled respectively by 1 , 2 , 3 with @xmath32 and @xmath56 .",
    "suppose an arab coalition is set against israel with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the new propensities become respectively @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath60 .",
    "they are now minimized by @xmath61 to gives an energy of @xmath60 to all three couplings .",
    "the cold war scenario means that the two existing world level coalitions generate much stonger couplings than purely bilateral ones , i.e. , @xmath62 since to belong to a world level coalition produces more advantages than purely local unproper relationship .",
    "local bond propensities are neutralized since overwhelmed by the two block site exchanges .",
    "the overall system is very stable .",
    "there exists one stable distribution between both competing alliances .",
    "we consider first the coherent case in which cultural and economical trends go along the same coalition , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "then from eq .",
    "( 8) the minimum of @xmath64 is unique with all country propensities satisfied .",
    "each country chooses its coalition according to its natural belonging , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "this result is readily proven via the variable change @xmath66 which turns the energy to , @xmath67 above hamiltonian representd a ferromagnetic ising hamiltonian in positive symmetry breaking fields @xmath52 .",
    "indeed it has one unique minimum with all @xmath68 .",
    "the remarkable result here is that the existence of two apriori world level coalitions is identical to the case of a unique coalition with every country in it .",
    "it shed light on the stability of the cold war situation where each country satisfies its proper relationship .",
    "differences and conflicts appear to be part of an overall cooperation within this scenario .",
    "the dynamics for one unique coalition including every country , or two competing alliances , is the same since what matters is the existence of a well defined stable configuration",
    ". however there exists a difference which is not relevant at this stage of the model since we assumed @xmath69 . in reality",
    "@xmath70 makes the existence of two coalitions to produce a lower  energy \" than a unique coalition since then , more @xmath1 can also be satisfied .",
    "it worth to notice that field terms @xmath71 account for the difference in energy cost in breaking a pair proper relationship for respectively a large and a small country .",
    "consider for instance two countries @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath72 .",
    "associated pair energy is @xmath73 conditions @xmath65 and @xmath74 give the minimum energy , @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( 11 ) it is easily seen that in case @xmath3 breaks proper alignment shifting to @xmath76 the cost in energy is @xmath77 . in parallel",
    "when @xmath2 shifts to @xmath78 the cost is higher with @xmath79 .",
    "therfore the cost in energy is lower for a breaking from proper alignment by the small country ( @xmath80 ) than by the large country ( @xmath81 ) . in the real world , it is clearly not the same for instance for the us to be against argentina than to argentina to be against the us .",
    "we now consider the uncoherent case in which cultural and economical trends may go along opposite coalitions , i.e. , @xmath82 . using above variable change @xmath66 , the hamiltonian becomes , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is given and equal to @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is formally identical to the ferromagnetic ising hamiltonian in random fields @xmath87 .",
    "the local field term @xmath88 modifies the country field @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) to @xmath89 which now can happen to be zero .",
    "this change is qualitative since now there exists the possibility to have ",
    "unstability \" , i.e. , zero local effective field coupled to the individual choice .",
    "moreover countries which have opposite cultural and economical trends may now follow their economical interest against their cultural interest or vice versa .",
    "two qualitatively different situations may occur .",
    "* unbalanced economical power : in this case we have @xmath90 .",
    "+ the symmetry is now broken in favor of one of the coalition . but still there exists only one minimum . *",
    "balanced economical power : in this case we have @xmath91 .",
    "+ symmetry is preserved and @xmath86 is identical to the ferromagnetic ising hamiltonian in random fields which has one unique minimum .",
    "very recently the eastern block has disappeared .",
    "however it the western block is still active as before . in this model , within our notations , denoting a the western alignment , we have still @xmath42 for countries which had @xmath42 . on the opposite ,",
    "countries which had @xmath43 have now turned to either @xmath42 if joining nato or to @xmath44 otherwise .",
    "therefore above @xmath69 assumption based on the inequality @xmath92 no longer holds for each pair of countries . in particular propensity",
    "@xmath93 become equal to @xmath1 in all cases where @xmath44 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    a new distribution of countries results from the collapse of one block .",
    "on the one hand a coalition countries still determine their actual choices between themselves according to @xmath96 .",
    "on the other hand former b coalition countries are now determining their choices according to competing links @xmath1 which did not automatically agree with former @xmath96 .",
    "this subset of countries has turned from a random site spin glasses without frustration into a random bond spin glasses with frustration .",
    "the former b coalition subset has jumped from one stable minimum to a highly degenerated unstable landscape with many local minima .",
    "this property could be related to the fragmentation process where ethnic minorities and states are shifting rapidly allegiances back and forth while they were formerly part of a stable structure just few years ago .",
    "while the b coalition world organization has disappeared , the a coalition world organization did not change and is still active .",
    "the condition @xmath62 is still valid for a pair of countries with @xmath97 . associated countries thus maintain a stable relationship and avoid a fragmentation process .",
    "this result supports a posteriori argument against the dissolution of nato once warsaw pact was disolved .",
    "it also favors the viewpoint that former warsaw pact countries should now join nato .    above situation",
    "could also shed some light on the current european debate .",
    "it would mean european stability is mainly the result of the existence of european structures with economical reality and not the outcome of a new friendship among former ennemies .",
    "these structures produce associated propensities @xmath96 much stronger than local competing propensities @xmath1 which are still there .",
    "european stability would indeed result from @xmath98 and not from all having @xmath99 .",
    "an eventual setback in the european construction ( @xmath100 ) would then automatically produce a fragmentation process analogous of what happened in former yugoslavia with the activation of ancestral bilateral local conflicts .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a new way to describe alliance forming phenomena among a set of countries .",
    "it was shown that within our model the cold war stabilty was not the result of two opposite alliances but rather the existence of alliances which neutralize the conflicting interactions within allies .",
    "it means also that having two alliances or just one is qualitatively the same with respect to stability .    from this viewpoint",
    "the strong instabilies which resulted from the warsow pact dissolution are given a simple explanation .",
    "simultaneously some hints are obtained about possible policies to stabilize world nation relationships . along this line , the importance of european construction was also underlined . at this stage ,",
    "our model remains rather basic .",
    "however it opens some new road to explore and to forecast international policies .",
