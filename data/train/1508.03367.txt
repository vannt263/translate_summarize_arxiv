    "the best candidate for a microscopic description of m - theory is the matrix model originally proposed in  @xcite as a regularisation of the supermembrane theory and subsequently conjectured in  @xcite to describe the full dynamics of the theory in light - front quantisation when the size of the matrices is sent to infinity .",

    "more generally there is no quantitative prescription for the study of this type of membrane interactions , which would make it possible to evaluate the associated transition amplitudes .",
    "this makes it difficult to test any results for these amplitudes that may be obtained from the matrix model .",
    "this is of course a general difficulty with all predictions of the matrix model , which so far have been mostly tested at the level of the low energy supergravity approximation .    the ads / cft correspondence  and specifically the duality proposed in  @xcite , relating m - theory in ads@xmath8 to an @xmath9 chern ",
    "simons theory  provides in principle new means of testing the matrix model predictions by comparing them to a dual cft . in the context of the duality of",
    "@xcite it was recently shown in  @xcite that the matrix model description of m - theory in ads@xmath8 can be quantitatively compared to the dual gauge theory without relying on the supergravity approximation or compactification to type iia string theory in ten dimensions .",
    "the crucial observation of  @xcite was that , focussing on large angular momentum states in m - theory and the dual cft sector involving monopole operators , natural approximation schemes arise on the two sides of the duality , so that a systematic , quantitative comparison is possible .    on the gravity side , m - theory states with large angular momentum , @xmath10 , along a great circle in @xmath11 can be studied using the pp - wave approximation .",
    "the associated matrix model uses @xmath12 matrices and its action was constructed in  @xcite .",
    "we will use basic properties of the model which were further studied in  @xcite .",
    "multi - membrane states in the pp - wave matrix model consist of concentric membranes and their fluctuations .",
    "more precisely the vacua of the theory consist of spherical membranes which extend in ads@xmath13 directions and are point - like in @xmath11 .",
    "they are classified by a set of integers , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , corresponding to a partition of the total angular momentum among @xmath16 membranes .",
    "the fluctuations of the spherical membranes described by the pp - wave matrix model are associated , in the dual gauge theory , with certain monopole operators .",
    "the latter are characterised by their integer gno charges , which are in one - to - one correspondence with the angular momenta , @xmath14 , of the membranes .",
    "the sector of monopole operators with large gno charges can be reliably studied using a weakly - coupled effective low - energy approximation .",
    "the ads@xmath13/cft@xmath17 duality in this m - theoretic regime relates correlation functions of monopole operators in the abjm theory to processes on the gravity side in which the dual states interact in the bulk and propagate to the boundary .",
    "the simplest such process involves a single membrane splitting into two  with the associated three states propagating to the boundary  and it corresponds to a three - point correlation function of monopole operators .",
    "similar processes have been studied in the case of the ads@xmath18/cft@xmath13 correspondence , in which three - point functions of gauge - invariant operators are related to cubic interaction vertices in the bulk associated with the splitting of strings in the pp - wave approximation . a method to compare the cubic vertices in string theory to the corresponding conformal three - point functions in the cft",
    "was discussed in  @xcite , following a spacetime interpretation first proposed in  @xcite .",
    "studies using other approaches can be found in  @xcite .",
    "similar aspects have been extensively studied beyond the pp - wave approximation taking advantage of the integrability appearing in the analysis of the system . for recent interesting developments and up - to - date references ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the three - point correlation functions of monopole operators , in particular those with large charge @xmath10 , which are relevant in the present case , are well defined in the abjm theory and",
    "one expects that they should be computable within the cft framework .",
    "although in this paper we focus on the gravity side of the correspondence , it is important that in principle the results of the matrix model calculation can be verified by independent means . successfully comparing the physical transition amplitudes associated with a membrane splitting or joining process to the gauge theory results for three - point functions would provide such an independent test .",
    "the agreement would not only represent a highly non - trivial test of the ads@xmath13/cft@xmath17 correspondence , but it would also provide strong evidence indicating that the matrix model captures the aspects of the dynamics of membranes related to splitting / joining interactions .    in the context of the pp - wave matrix model , processes of joining or splitting of membranes",
    "correspond to transitions between states built on vacua with different numbers of membranes .",
    "a semi - classical description of these transitions can be given in terms of tunnelling amplitudes associated with instanton configurations which interpolate between states containing different numbers of membranes .",
    "in this paper we initiate a study of these interpolating configurations .",
    "the relevant instantons are bps solutions to the euclidean equations of motion of the pp - wave matrix model  @xcite , with boundary conditions specifying the single or multiple membrane states between which they interpolate .",
    "the equations obeyed by these bps instantons , with the same boundary conditions , were studied in a different context in  @xcite , where they were found to arise as the equations describing domain walls interpolating between distinct isolated vacua of the so - called @xmath19 sym theory .",
    "a number of properties of these instanton equations and the associated moduli spaces were studied in  @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient in the analysis presented in  @xcite is the observation that the relevant instanton equations can be mapped to the nahm equations  @xcite which arise in the construction of bps monopoles , although with different boundary conditions .",
    "the bps instantons of the pp - wave matrix model are saddle points representing the dominant contribution to the tunnelling processes .",
    "physical transition amplitudes associated with the splitting / joining processes can be computed using a semi - classical approximation around the instanton solutions .",
    "this involves evaluating the determinants arising from the non - zero mode fluctuations as well as the integration over the collective coordinates associated with zero modes .",
    "although there may be alternative approaches to the computation of the splitting / joining transition amplitudes , in order to carry out the standard semi - classical calculations it is necessary to obtain the explicit form of the classical instanton solutions .",
    "however , although various general features of the instanton equations  including conditions for the existence of solutions and properties of their moduli spaces  were studied in  @xcite , little is known about explicit solutions . in particular",
    ", no solution is known for the most elementary process we are interested in , _ i.e.  _ the splitting of a single membrane into two .    in this paper we show that an efficient approach to the construction of solutions to the instanton equations as well as to the study of their moduli spaces can be developed using a continuum approximation .",
    "such an approximation scheme is valid in the case of large matrices and , therefore , it is applicable in the context of the m - theoretic regime of the ads@xmath13/cft@xmath17 duality considered in  @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the original instanton equations can be mapped to a continuum version of the nahm equations , which in turn can be shown to be equivalent to the three - dimensional laplace equation , using results in  @xcite . in this formulation",
    "equipotential surfaces for the solution to the laplace equation directly represent the profile of the membranes at different times . using this approach we present explicit analytic solutions describing the splitting of membranes .",
    "a remarkable feature of our construction is that , in order to obtain a solution representing the splitting of one membrane into two , we are led to consider the laplace equation not in the ordinary three - dimensional euclidean space , but rather in a three - dimensional generalisation of a two - sheeted riemann surface , which we refer to as a riemann space following  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of riemann spaces , which can be naturally motivated in the context of the construction of our solutions , is quite intriguing .",
    "the possibility that in the description of membrane interactions riemann spaces may play a central role , similar to that played by riemann surfaces in string perturbation theory , is very interesting and deserves further investigation .",

    "we describe the instanton equations and we recall some general properties of their solutions and of the associated moduli space which were obtained in  @xcite . in section  [ rsapprox ] we discuss the continuum approximation scheme used in our analysis and the mapping of the instanton equations to the three - dimensional laplace equation . in section  [ rssolutions ]",

    "it is the most elementary example of a splitting process and it allows us to illustrate general properties which are common to all splitting / joining transitions .",
    "we will now argue that it is not possible to describe a membrane splitting process in terms of a solution to the laplace equation formulated in a standard euclidean space @xmath0 .",
    "instead , we are led to introduce the concept of riemann space explained in detail below . in order to motivate our proposal ,",
    "let us first discuss the qualitative features of a typical instanton solution describing a splitting process .",
    "the transition from a spherical membrane to two concentric membranes can be qualitatively described as involving the steps depicted in figure  [ rpqualitativesplit ] . starting with a single membrane of radius @xmath165 a small perturbation forms and grows until the membrane splits into two , resulting in the creation of a second disconnected membrane inside the first one , as shown in steps ( @xmath176 ) to ( @xmath177 ) in the figure  . ] .",
    "to understand the subsequent steps it is important to notice that membranes are charged and thus oriented objects . in figure  [ rpqualitativesplit ] the orientation of the membranes",
    "is indicated by the relative position of the continuous and dashed contour lines : membranes have an outer continuous contour , whereas in anti - membranes the outer contour is dashed . in the pp - wave background",
    "a configuration of two concentric membranes with the same orientation , which is bps , is stable as a result of the balance between the gravitational attraction and the force associated with the three - form flux .",
    "the two forces add up in the case of a membrane anti - membrane pair , resulting in an unstable configuration .    as shown in figure  [ rpqualitativesplit ] , after the splitting takes place the internal membrane that is formed has opposite orientation compared to the initial one and the resulting configuration is not stable . to complete the transition to a stable vacuum consisting of two concentric membranes",
    "it is necessary for the internal membrane to flip its orientation .",
    "this process requires intermediate steps in which the membrane self - intersects after developing cusps , see ( @xmath178)-(@xmath179 ) in figure  [ rpqualitativesplit ] .",
    "the process shown in the figure has axial symmetry , but this is of course not a requirement . in general",
    "the details of the intermediate configurations can vary , however , an essential element , common to all splitting processes , is the fact that a flipping of the orientation is inevitable . in the illustrative example shown in the figure",
    "the sequence of steps leading to the final two - membrane state involves a splitting resulting in the formation of a second internal anti - membrane followed by the flipping of the orientation of the latter .",
    "however , as we will see in explicit examples in the next subsection , the splitting and flipping steps can also take place in reverse order , or simultaneously .        applying the approach described in section  [ rsapprox ] ,",
    "our goal is to construct a solution , @xmath180 , to the laplace equation such that the associated equipotential surfaces reproduce the qualitative behaviour shown in figure  [ rpqualitativesplit ] .",
    "the crucial feature of any splitting process , which emerges from the qualitative arguments we presented above , is the fact that necessarily there exists a finite interval of values of the potential for which the equipotential surfaces are self - intersecting .",
    "such a behaviour is not compatible with the potential @xmath180 being a solution to the laplace equation in the ordinary @xmath0 space , because the associated gradient , @xmath181 , would be ill - defined , since the normal direction differs on the two portions of a self - intersecting equipotential surface . in the case of the intersections occurring during the flipping of the membrane orientation , this issue arises not just at isolated singular points , but over a finite region corresponding to an interval of values of @xmath180 .",
    "this motivates us to consider multi - valued potential functions .",
    "more concretely the above observations lead us to propose that the potential relevant for the representation of a membrane splitting process should be a solution to the laplace equation in a space , which we refer to as a riemann space , that is a three - dimensional generalisation of a two - sheeted riemann surface .",
    "such a space consists of two copies of @xmath0 connected by a branch surface , bounded by a branch curve or loop . for simplicity we will assume the surface connecting the two @xmath0 s to always have the topology of a disk and in the following we will use the expression branch disk without necessarily implying a circular planar shape   we present a reformulation of the laplace equation in a riemann space as an integral equation and we discuss in more detail the boundary conditions at the branch disk . to construct solutions relevant for the description of membrane splitting processes we require the potential to be finite at the branch loop and also to decay sufficiently rapidly at infinity . ] .",
    "deformations of the branch disk which leave the branch loop fixed yield physically equivalent riemann spaces .",
    "this is analogous to properties of branch cuts and branch points of riemann surfaces .",
    "a space defined in this way is locally equivalent to @xmath0 , but differs globally .",
    "the use of a riemann space makes it possible to have a potential which locally solves the laplace equation , while avoiding the problems caused by self - intersecting equipotential surfaces .",
    "the solution is such that different portions of self - intersecting surfaces live on different sheets of the riemann space , so that no intersections take place within the same copy of @xmath0 .",
    "the description of a stable spherical membrane in section  [ rsssolutioncoulomb ] provides an indication of what the asymptotic behaviour of the potential should be in the case of a splitting process .",
    "the infinite past , @xmath182 , corresponds to @xmath183 , _",
    "i.e.  _ large values of the potential . in this region",
    "the equipotential surfaces should be small spheres with radius proportional to @xmath10 and approaching zero .",
    "the infinite future , @xmath184 , corresponds to @xmath185 , _",
    "i.e.  _ small values of the potential approaching zero from above . in this region the equipotential surfaces",
    "should be two large concentric spheres with radii proportional to @xmath172 and @xmath173 and growing indefinitely . using a riemann space we can construct a potential which provides a concrete realisation of this type of asymptotic behaviour and is also well - defined in the intermediate region where the membranes self - intersect .",
    "more precisely , in order to account for the behaviour at large @xmath186 we consider a point charge @xmath10 at the origin of the first @xmath0 , so that close to the charge we have a coulomb potential , whose equipotential surfaces are small spheres .",
    "the behaviour in the two @xmath0 s for small @xmath134 , on the other hand , can be understood as resulting from the splitting of the initial flux @xmath10 of @xmath187 , with a fraction @xmath172 going to infinity in the first space and a fraction @xmath188 passing into the second space through the branch disk .",
    "figure  [ rpqualitativesplitriemann ] illustrates qualitatively the splitting process as rendered in the riemann space , with the six rows in the picture corresponding to the same stages of the splitting process shown in figure  [ rpqualitativesplit ] .",
    "the first two columns depict the two sheets of the riemann space , with each copy of @xmath0 represented as a rectangle .",
    "the horizontal slit corresponds to the branch disk , with the dots at the end points indicating the branch loop .",
    "the third column shows the two copies of @xmath0 superposed .",
    "membranes , or portions of membranes , are represented as continuous lines in the first @xmath0 and as dashed lines in the second @xmath0 . the same notation will be used in the figures throughout the paper .",
    "re - analysing the splitting process as presented in the figure allows us to clarify how the issues associated with the flipping of the membrane orientation and the self - intersections in the equipotential surfaces can be addressed using a riemann space . as the value of the potential decreases , away from the point charge , the equipotential surfaces intersect the branch disk and",
    "therefore extend partially into the second copy of @xmath0 .",
    "this is shown at step ( @xmath177 ) , where the splitting has already taken place .",
    "crucially the use of a riemann space allows us to have self - intersecting surfaces which result from the superposition of portions of surfaces without self - intersections in each sheet .",
    "this is illustrated in row ( @xmath189 ) in figure  [ rpqualitativesplitriemann ] .",
    "notice that in the third column intersections occur only between a continuous and a dashed line , never between two continuous or two dashed lines . the final configuration in the splitting process",
    "is represented by two membranes , each contained entirely in one copy of @xmath0 , with the superposition resulting in two concentric surfaces .    as already pointed out ,",
    "a feature of the solution is that during the flipping process the equipotential surfaces develop cusps .",
    "these special points occur as the equipotential surfaces intersect the branch loop , as shown at step ( @xmath178 ) in figure  [ rpqualitativesplitriemann ] . from the explicit solutions discussed in the next subsection",
    "one can verify that the potential itself is regular over the entire riemann space ( except for the origin of the first @xmath0 where the point charge is located ) , including the branch loop where the cusps arise  .",
    "at these points , however , the gradient of the potential diverges .",
    "this allows us to physically characterise the branch loop in the riemann space in terms of the behaviour of the solution to the continuum nahm equations .",
    "recalling that the potential , @xmath190 , is obtained inverting the functions @xmath191 , we deduce that the branch loop , where @xmath181 diverges , corresponds to points where the velocity of the front of the membrane , as described by @xmath191 in euclidean time , vanishes .",
    "various other properties of the instanton solutions corresponding to membrane splitting processes and their moduli spaces can be given an intuitive interpretation using a description in terms of riemann spaces .",
    "we will discuss some of these aspects in section  [ rssmodulispaces ] .",
    "in section  [ rsapprox ] we have shown that the problem of solving the continuous version of the instanton equations can be mapped to that of finding solutions to the three - dimensional laplace equation . then in the previous subsection",
    "we have discussed the boundary conditions that we propose to consider in order to obtain a potential with the required properties .",
    "we now present analytic examples showing explicitly that solutions obeying such boundary conditions can be constructed .",
    "based on the examples of static solutions presented in section  [ rsssolutioncoulomb ] , we expect the potential for large @xmath134 ( corresponding to @xmath192 in the original euclidean time variable ) to have a coulomb - like singularity .",
    "the considerations in the previous subsection about the expected qualitative behaviour of the potential then lead us to consider the laplace equation in a riemann space made of two copies of @xmath0 , with boundary conditions associated with the presence of a single positive point charge at the origin of the first @xmath0 .",
    "the idea of studying the laplace equation in a riemann space has actually been considered long ago by sommerfeld in a 1896 paper  @xcite , which introduces the idea of riemann spaces to develop a generalisation of the standard method of images for the solution of electrostatics problems .",
    "the examples studied in  @xcite involve multiple copies of @xmath0 with branch curves consisting of straight lines .",

    "we will present plots showing the evolution of the membrane profiles , using the parametrisation in terms of the @xmath137 variables , in the case of solutions interpolating between configurations with two membranes in the initial state and two in the final state .      in the previous subsections we presented explicit solutions to the laplace equation describing the most elementary splitting process with a single membrane in the initial state and two membranes in the final state .",
    "it is natural to ask whether a similar approach can be used to construct other solutions corresponding to ( anti-)instantons of the pp - wave matrix model interpolating between states with different numbers of membranes . a large class of solutions connecting multi - membrane states was shown to exist in  @xcite .",
    "for our reformulation in terms of the laplace equation to be equivalent to the original ( continuum ) instanton equations , solutions should exist for all the allowed instanton configurations",
    ". therefore it should be possible to identify suitable boundary conditions corresponding to all the pairs of initial and final states for the original equations , which are permitted according to the criteria in  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we will show that the conditions for the existence of bps instanton solutions obtained in  @xcite can be reproduced using our formulation in terms of the laplace equation in a riemann space .",
    "an analysis of the general features of the solutions we discussed above provides hints for the generalisation to more complicated processes . in the cases discussed in section  [ rsssolutionhobson ] the two membranes in the final state correspond to equipotential surfaces in the asymptotic regions at infinity , one in each of the two copies of @xmath0 constituting the riemann space . on the other hand the single membrane in the infinite past corresponds to small spheres centred at the location of the point charge .",
    "these considerations lead us to propose the following general prescription . in order to describe a process with @xmath16 membranes in the final state one should consider a riemann space made of @xmath16 copies of @xmath0 . moreover ,",
    "if the initial state contains @xmath75 membranes one should consider @xmath75 ( positive ) point charges at the origin of @xmath75 distinct @xmath0 s .",
    "the values of the point charges , @xmath14 , @xmath261 , correspond to the angular momenta of the @xmath75 membranes in the initial state .",
    "the values of the flux of @xmath187 at infinity in each copy of @xmath0 , @xmath262 , @xmath48 , correspond to the angular momenta of the @xmath16 membranes in the final state .",
    "we point out that an immediate consequence of this prescription is that by construction the number , @xmath16 , of membranes in the final state is greater than or equal to the number , @xmath75 , of membranes in the initial state .",
    "therefore the necessary condition , @xmath81 , for the existence of instanton solutions is automatically satisfied .    in the case of a generic riemann space",
    "the relation between the outgoing fluxes at infinity , @xmath263 , and the values of the point charges at the origin , @xmath14 , is non - trivial .",
    "this is because the way in which the flux of @xmath187 gets split among the different spaces depends in a complicated way on the number , shape and size of the branch disks and on their positions relative to the point charges . in the most elementary case of the solution  ( [ rfhobsonspotential ] )",
    "we gave explicit formulae for the asymptotic fluxes associated with the two membranes in the final state in  ( [ rfphi1aympt])-([rfphi2aymptaxial ] ) .",
    "general multi - sheeted riemann spaces can involve different combinations of branch surfaces .",
    "this is the case even in the most elementary example discussed in the previous subsection , in which one membrane with angular momentum @xmath10 splits into two membranes with angular momenta @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "we described this process using a riemann space made of two copies of @xmath0 with a single point charge , @xmath10 , and we presented an exact solution involving a circular branch disk .",
    "however , the same process receives contributions from more complicated riemann spaces in which the two @xmath0 s are connected by multiple branch disks , so long as the flux at infinity in the two spaces is split into the same fractions , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "of course in order to compute a specific physical transition amplitude it is necessary to sum all the contributions with the given initial and final states .",
    "the issue of how the different copies of @xmath0 are connected is related to the parameterisation of the moduli spaces of the associated instanton solutions and we will briefly comment on this point in section  [ rssmodulispaces ] .    at the present stage",
    "we do not have a proof of existence of solutions to the three - dimensional laplace equation in arbitrary riemann spaces , but we propose as a conjecture that solutions should exist for all the boundary conditions which according to our prescription correspond to allowed ( anti-)instantons .",
    "the results of  @xcite and  @xcite provide a starting point for the analysis of the issue of existence of solutions in general riemann spaces .",
    "one may view the explicit solutions in  @xcite and  @xcite as playing a role similar to that played by the explicit solution for a spherical conductor obtained by the method of images in connection with the theory of the electric potential for arbitrarily shaped conductors .",
    "moreover the laplace equation in the riemann space can be recast into the form of an integral equation as discussed in appendix  [ rsaconnectingconditionintegraleq ] .",
    "this reformulation may also provide a useful approach to obtain a proof of existence for the solutions .      before discussing how some general properties of the instanton moduli space arise within our formulation using the laplace equation , we now present other exact solutions .",
    "we use these specific examples to illustrate some interesting features arising more generally in the description of instanton configurations in terms of equipotential surfaces .",
    "the linearity of the laplace equation of course implies that linear combinations of solutions are also solutions .",
    "we can take advantage of this simple observation to obtain new interesting examples .",
    "in particular , a solution describing a process with two membranes with angular momenta @xmath172 and @xmath173 in the initial state and two in the final state  which based on our prescription requires a two - sheeted riemann space with a point charge in each copy of @xmath0  can be obtained as a linear combination of the potential  ( [ rfhobsonspotential ] ) with charge @xmath172 and the analogous potential with point charge @xmath173 at @xmath264 in the second space . to obtain the potential due to a point charge at the point corresponding to @xmath167 in the second space",
    ", we recall that in peripolar coordinates the first sheet is parameterised by @xmath265 $ ] and the second sheet by @xmath266 $ ] .",
    "therefore the potential induced by a charge located at the point in the second @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath167 is obtained substituting @xmath267 in  ( [ rfhobsonspotential ] ) .",
    "the resulting solution in the two sheeted riemann space with point charges in both spaces is @xmath268 \\notag \\\\ & \\ , + \\frac{j_2}{4\\pi|\\bm{z}-\\bm{z}_0| }   \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } - \\frac{1}{\\pi } \\arcsin\\!\\left (   \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\theta - \\theta_0}{2}\\right )   \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\cosh \\alpha + 1 } }   \\right ) \\right ]   \\label{rfscatteringpotential } \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{4\\pi |\\bm{z}-\\bm{z}_0| }    \\left [ \\frac{(j_1+j_2)}{2 } + \\frac{(j_1-j_2)}{\\pi } \\arcsin\\!\\left (   \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\theta - \\theta_0}{2}\\right )   \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\cosh \\alpha + 1 } }   \\right ) \\right ] , { \\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath269 and @xmath270 are given in  ( [ rfhobsonsdistance ] ) and  ( [ rfhobsonscoshalpha ] ) respectively and we have chosen the radius of the branch loop to be @xmath246 .",
    "the sign difference between the first two lines in  ( [ rfscatteringpotential ] ) comes from the shift in @xmath248 . recalling that @xmath270 is independent of @xmath248",

    "notice that if the two charges are equal , @xmath272 , ( [ rfscatteringpotential ] ) reduces to a simple coulomb potential in both sheets of the riemann space .",
    "this is consistent with our general prescription . with equal charges the fluxes of @xmath187 from the first space into the second and from the second space into the first are equal , irrespective of the position , @xmath167 , of the charges .",
    "so the flux at infinity in the two spaces is the same and hence the final state is the same as the initial state .",
    "therefore this case corresponds simply to a stable vacuum configuration with two membranes of the same size .",
    "note that , up to an overall scale , the potential  ( [ rfscatteringpotential ] ) can also be obtained from the superposition of the solution  ( [ rfhobsonspotential ] ) and a simple coulomb potential .",
    "we now focus on the special case of axially symmetric solutions ( corresponding to @xmath273 ) with @xmath274 , @xmath275 for which  ( [ rfscatteringpotential ] ) becomes @xmath276 \\ , , \\label{rfscatteringpotential32}\\ ] ] where we used the fact that @xmath277 when @xmath167 is on the axis of the disk .",
    "the final states in the process described by the potential  ( [ rfscatteringpotential32 ] ) depend on the way in which the total flux at infinity is divided between the two spaces , which in turn is controlled by the value of @xmath248 .",

    "the flux flowing to the @xmath176-th space from the @xmath293-th space equals @xmath291 . since there is a positive charge in the @xmath293-th space and no charge in the @xmath176-th space",
    ", it is clear that the flux should always flow from the @xmath293-th to the @xmath176-th space , not the other way around .",

    "the property ( [ rfsumrule2 ] ) can be deduced as follows .",
    "we consider a special potential function in the riemann space defined by the requirement that in each copy of @xmath0 it is identical to the coulomb potential associated with a unit charge at the origin .",

    "the existence of this solution implies that if @xmath297 , then @xmath298 in ( [ rfdefmatrixk ] ) , which is equivalent to ( [ rfsumrule2 ] ) .    the positivity ( [ rfpositivityk ] ) and the sum rules ( [ rfsumrule1])-([rfsumrule2 ] ) imply rather strong constraints on the allowed combinations of @xmath14 s and @xmath262 s , including conditions equivalent to the criteria given in @xcite for the existence of solutions .",

    ", we have @xmath309 which gives a continuum counterpart of the necessary condition ( [ rfinstaction ] ) for the existence of instantons ( which can also be derived directly by defining the continuum version of ( [ rfsuperpotential ] ) ) .",
    "one can introduce an `` entropy '' associated with the distribution of the total angular momentum among the individual membranes defined as @xmath310 for the initial and final states respectively .",
    "then by taking @xmath311 in ( [ rfconditionpnorm ] ) and using the conservation law @xmath312 , one can show that the entropy is always non - decreasing , @xmath313 let us now deduce the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of instantons given in @xcite . the condition can be phrased as follows ( cf .",
    "figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "since the @xmath14 s are non negative , they can be represented by a histogram as shown in figure [ rphistogram ] ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "a similar histogram can be constructed with the @xmath263 s in the final state .",
    "can be represented as a histogram as shown in ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "the area of the histogram @xmath314 below a given height @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath315 .",
    "we define histograms @xmath316 and @xmath317 by cutting the original histogram @xmath314 along the horizontal line and taking the part above and below it , as shown in ( @xmath318 ) and ( @xmath177 ) . ]",
    "we draw a horizontal line at a height @xmath319 on the histogram and denote the area of the histogram below the value @xmath10 by @xmath320 the condition in @xcite can then be expressed as @xmath321 ( we note that we do not assume @xmath322 or @xmath323 here . ) thus , the area of the support of the histogram @xmath262 is always larger than or equal to that of the histogram @xmath14 .",
    "an interpretation of this condition is that the histogram @xmath262 should be more smeared compared to the histogram @xmath14 , which is natural in view of ( [ rfentropyincrease ] )  ) is stronger than the condition ( [ rfjcubeddecreasing ] ) .",
    "for example , the case with @xmath324 and @xmath325 is allowed by ( [ rfjcubeddecreasing ] ) , but it is prohibited by ( [ rfbhpcondition ] ) . ] .    in order to prove ( [ rfbhpcondition ] ) we introduce two auxiliary histograms , @xmath326 and @xmath327 , generated cutting the histogram @xmath14 at a fixed height @xmath10 . as shown in figure [ rphistogram ] , we define @xmath328 and @xmath327 as the histograms above and below the horizontal line at the height @xmath10 , respectively . by definition",
    "we have @xmath329 moreover @xmath330 we first focus on the histogram defined by @xmath331 .",
    "all columns in this histogram have height smaller than or equal to @xmath10 , _ i.e.  _ @xmath332 . to see this we recall that ( [ rfsumrule2 ] )",
    "implies that @xmath333 = \\left [   \\begin{array}{c }      j\\\\      \\vdots \\\\",
    "j    \\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ] since all elements of @xmath317 are smaller than or equal to @xmath10 by definition and all elements of @xmath287 are positive ( [ rfpositivityk ] ) , the elements of @xmath331 can not be larger than @xmath10 .",
    "the sum rule ( [ rfsumrule1 ] ) implies that area of the histogram @xmath331 is the same as the area of the histogram @xmath317 , which by definition equals @xmath315 .",
    "now recall that @xmath334 .",
    "since the height of the histogram @xmath331 is less than or equal to @xmath10 , all of the histogram @xmath331 contributes to @xmath335 .",
    "the area @xmath335 has a further contribution from @xmath336 , which is always non - negative , because of the positivity of @xmath287 and @xmath337 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath338 and ( [ rfbhpcondition ] ) is proven .",
    "another interesting property of the moduli space of solutions to the bps instanton equation ( [ rfbpseq ] ) , which was established in @xcite , is the additivity rule ( [ rfadditivity ] ) for the dimension of the moduli spaces .",
    "a possible interpretation of this result , which is instructive if perhaps not mathematically rigorous , is the following .",
    "we assume that we have two instanton solutions , interpolating between vacua a and b , and between vacua b and c , such that both of them are reasonably localised in time .",
    "it is natural to expect that one can construct an instanton solution interpolating between vacuum a and vacuum c , by stitching together the two original solutions taken to be well separated in time .",
    "the number of parameters of the composite instanton thus constructed should be given by the sum of the numbers of parameters of the two original instantons .",
    "this construction of a composite instanton from two instantons well separated in time has a natural counterpart in our description of the instantons using riemann spaces .",
    "the following argument relies on viewing a solution in a multi - sheeted riemann space as a composite of solutions built using pairs of connected copies of @xmath0 . within this picture",
    "the basic idea underlying the construction is that , at least in the asymptotic region at infinity , a branch disk with incoming flux can be viewed as a point charge . here",
    "we wish to point out the essential features of this construction without going into the details . in the following it",
    "is crucial that the time variable in the bps instanton corresponds to the logarithm of the distance from the origin in our description .",
    "we start with two instanton solutions , each associated with the branch disks @xmath339 and @xmath340 . because of the scale invariance of the laplace equation , one can move one of the disks , _",
    "e.g.  _ @xmath340 , further away from the origin by rescaling simultaneously its size and its distance from the origin .",
    "the physics associated with the second disk , such as the number of flux lines going into the disk and the profile of the potential function do not change under the rescaling .",
    "we refer to the rescaled disk as @xmath341 .",
    "now we consider a new riemann space equipped with two branch disks , @xmath339 and @xmath341 .",
    "since the disk @xmath341 is sufficiently far away , its existence does not affect the potential produced by the point charge at the origin and the first branch disk @xmath339 .",
    "furthermore , from the viewpoint of the second disk @xmath341 , the disk @xmath339 and the point charge appear as a new point charge at the origin whose value can be reconstructed using the original charge and the number of flux lines going through the disk @xmath339 . in this manner , the potential on the riemann space with two disks ( @xmath339 , @xmath341 ) can be constructed by using the potentials corresponding to the two separate solutions associated with the disks @xmath339 and @xmath340 .",
    "as previously mentioned , the calculation of physical transition amplitudes using a semi - classical approximation involves the integration over the collective coordinates parameterising the instanton moduli space . from the point of view of the description of the moduli space in terms of the geometry of riemann spaces",
    ", this means that one should sum the contributions of all possible combinations of branch surfaces giving rise to the same initial and final states .",
    "such a sum may include not only branch disks of more complicated shapes than the circular ones we discussed , but also in principle branch surfaces with more complicated topology , _ e.g.  _ consisting of higher genus surfaces with boundaries",
    ". it would be interesting to study the characteristics of the resulting riemann spaces .",
    "in this paper we have initiated a study of the interactions associated with membrane splitting / joining processes in m - theory . we considered a large angular momentum sector of m - theory in ads@xmath146 , which can be described using the matrix model approach in the pp - wave approximation .",
    "the vacua of the pp - wave matrix model consist of collections of concentric membranes and contributions to splitting or joining processes arise from tunnelling amplitudes between states built on vacua with different numbers of membranes .",
    "classical tunnelling configurations are instantons , _ i.e.  _ finite action solutions to the euclidean equations of motion of the pp - wave matrix model . relying on the same ideas underlying the definition of the matrix model as regularisation of the supermembrane theory ,",
    "we have presented a method for the construction of approximate solutions to the instanton equations . using a continuum formulation in which large matrices are approximated by functions",
    ", we have shown that the problem of constructing solutions to the instanton equations of the pp - wave matrix model can be reduced to that of solving the three - dimensional laplace equation .",
    "a remarkable outcome of our analysis is that in order to describe membrane splitting / joining processes it is necessary to study the laplace equation in a riemann space , which is a three - dimensional generalisation of the familiar concept of riemann surface .",
    "the interpolating configurations at different points in euclidean time arise as equipotential surfaces for the solutions to the laplace equations in a riemann space with suitable boundary conditions .",
    "the use of riemann spaces provides a very compelling answer to various issues arising in the description of membrane splitting processes in terms of the laplace equation .",
    "the approach we developed in this paper presents some similarities to the description of splitting / joining interactions in the matrix string formulation of type iia string theory  @xcite in terms of instantons in two - dimensional sym theory  @xcite .",
    "there are also some analogies between our work and  @xcite , in which 1/4 bps solitons in @xmath342 sym are described using multi - pronged @xmath343 string states .",
    "the latter are constructed using the two - dimensional laplace equation which arises from configurations of m2-branes stretched between m5-branes .    in section  [ rssolutions ]",
    "we presented exact solutions to the laplace equation , which represent approximate solutions to the original bps instanton equations valid for large @xmath10 .",
    "the instanton configurations in the matrix model are saddle points for the euclidean path integral of the theory and can be used to compute contributions to physical transition amplitudes using a semi - classical approximation . as a next step it will be important to deduce the exact form of the solutions in the matrix model , associated with the approximate solutions we obtained using the continuum approximation .",
    "the connection between the instanton equations and the laplace equation in the continuum approximation is established mapping the former to the nahm equations .",
    "this means that in the process of reconstructing the matrix model solutions we should be able to take advantage of the integrability properties of the nahm equations .",
    "semi - classical contributions to physical transition amplitudes in the lorentzian signature pp - wave matrix model should be obtained from a saddle point approximation about the instanton configurations followed by an analytic continuation .",
    "the semi - classical calculation involves an integration over the moduli space of the bps instantons , whose properties were studied in  @xcite .",
    "completing the semi - classical analysis will allow us to extract effective interaction vertices for membranes in the pp - wave background .",
    "a first interesting issue to address is the determination of the associated coupling constants .",
    "naively one would expect instanton induced transition amplitudes to be exponentially suppressed , due to the contribution of the classical instanton action .",
    "for instance the most elementary amplitude , corresponding to the splitting of a single membrane with angular momentum @xmath10 into two membranes with angular momenta @xmath172 and @xmath173 , carries a weight @xmath344 where @xmath345 and @xmath346 for the applicability of the pp - wave approximation in a weak coupling regime .",
    "however , it is probably premature to conclude that the coupling constant measuring the strength of membrane interactions is exponentially small .",
    "the dependence on the parameters can be modified by factors arising from the integration over the instanton moduli space , which has a dimension that grows with @xmath10  for example it is @xmath347 in the case of the single membrane splitting , see  ( [ rfdimm12 ] ) .",
    "volume factors can modify the exponential behaviour  ( [ rfinstantonweight ] ) and it is possible , at large @xmath10 in particular , for the complete physical transition amplitudes to have a power - law dependence on the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath21 , which might be more natural from the point of view of a description of membrane interactions in target space .",
    "a similar mechanism , leading to a power - law behaviour , has been recently suggested to arise in the calculation of solitonic contributions to certain scattering amplitudes  @xcite and may be relevant for the understanding of the connections between the maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory in five dimensions and the @xmath348 superconformal theory in six dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the particular solution  ( [ rfbhpsolution ] ) constructed in  @xcite , which approaches the configuration corresponding to the @xmath10-dimensional representation @xmath94 at @xmath58 , was studied in the context of the pp - wave matrix model in  @xcite . according to a proposal presented in  @xcite , the configuration associated with the representation",
    "@xmath94 should be interpreted as a single m5-brane and therefore the solution  ( [ rfbhpsolution ] ) would contribute to an amplitude coupling m2- and m5-branes .",
    "it would be interesting to determine whether such a coupling has a different weight in terms of the @xmath10 and @xmath21 parameters , compared to those involving only m2-branes .",
    "the study of instanton effects in another maximally supersymmetric theory , @xmath349 sym with su(@xmath21 ) gauge group , suggests that the large @xmath10 limit , which plays a central role in our continuum approximation , may also lead to important simplifications in the semi - classical calculation of physical transition amplitudes . in the case of @xmath349 sym at large @xmath21 the integration over the multi - instanton moduli space is dominated by special configurations and a saddle point approximation makes it possible to compute the leading contributions at large @xmath21 for arbitrary instanton number  @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand if a similar saddle point based approach can be applied in the present case for large @xmath10 .",
    "the following considerations , albeit somewhat speculative , may provide insights into possible mechanisms leading to the emergence of a saddle point approximation for large @xmath10 . among the collective",
    "coordinates parameterising the instanton moduli space there are variables associated with the su(@xmath10 ) gauge orientations , which are the remnant in the matrix model of the invariance of the membrane theory under area preserving diffeomorphisms ( apd s ) . when computing contributions to gauge invariant observables the integrations over these colour - related variables can be carried out and in general produce a non - trivial measure for the integrals over the remaining collective coordinates , that can be referred to as the ` physical ' ones . at large @xmath10",
    "this measure can be very peaked and give a large weight to special regions of the physical moduli space .",
    "in such a situation it is possible to expect the emergence of a good saddle point approximation .",
    "given the fact that the su(@xmath10 ) gauge symmetry descends from the apd invariance in the continuum , it may be natural to expect that the configurations acquiring the largest weight in the physical moduli space should be the smoothest ones , since they are the ones for which the finite su(@xmath10 ) symmetry is closer to the infinite dimensional group of apd transformations . in our description of instanton configurations in terms of the laplace equation on a riemann space",
    "the collective coordinates on the instanton moduli space are associated with the geometry of the riemann space .",
    "then the above reasoning suggests that contributions arising from the smoothest branch loops may be the dominant ones .",
    "hence for the specific transition amplitude corresponding to the splitting of one membrane into two , the riemann space with circular branch disk used in the hobson solution that we employed in section  [ rssolutions ] should presumably provide the dominant contribution .",
    "supersymmetry of the pp - wave matrix model is important in various aspects of the calculation of instanton contributions to the transition amplitudes that we are discussing .",
    "it is expected to be responsible for the cancellation of the determinants arising from the integration over non - zero mode fluctuations in the instanton background .",
    "moreover the instanton moduli space includes fermionic collective coordinates associated with supersymmetries broken by the instanton configurations .",
    "although the particular features of the supersymmetry algebra in the pp - wave background make the analysis rather subtle , we expect the presence of fermion zero modes to restrict the set of allowed instanton amplitudes .",
    "in addition to the conditions for the existence of interpolating instanton configurations discussed in  @xcite , further selection rules should arise from the integration over the fermionic collective coordinates .",
    "this was shown in  @xcite to be the case for the special solution  ( [ rfbhpsolution ] ) obtained in  @xcite .",
    "in general the results of  @xcite , showing that the vacua of the pp - wave matrix model are non - perturbatively protected , indicate that instanton induced transition amplitudes can be non - zero only when excited states are involved .",
    "it should be possible to gain further insights into the general selection rules which constrain these processes by studying the fermion zero modes in the background of the general matrix model solutions corresponding to those discussed in this paper in the continuum approximation .",
    "similarly to what happens in the case of @xmath349 sym  @xcite it should be possible to carry out this analysis even without a complete calculation of the transition amplitudes .",
    "various properties of the moduli space of solutions of the bps instanton equations were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the collective coordinates parameterising the matrix model solutions have counterparts in the parameters charactering the solutions to the laplace equation that we used our approach .",
    "the description in terms of the laplace equation provides a geometric and intuitive interpretation of some of these parameters and the linearity of the equation is useful in explaining certain features of the solutions . according to our proposal the configurations interpolating between different vacua of the pp - wave matrix model have an approximate description in terms of equipotential surfaces of potential functions solving the laplace equation in certain riemann spaces . any given solution",
    "is characterised by the states at @xmath63 in the original picture , _",
    "i.e.  _ by the asymptotic su(2 ) representations defined by the dimensions , @xmath14 , @xmath76 , and @xmath350 , @xmath351 , of the irreducible blocks at @xmath56 and @xmath58 respectively . in our description",
    "the values of the @xmath14 integers for the initial state correspond to point charges at the origin in different copies of @xmath0 , while the @xmath350 s for the final state correspond to the fluxes of the gradient of the potential at infinity in each of the @xmath0 s which constitute the riemann space .",
    "in such a picture the information on the parameters characterising the solutions should be encoded in the geometry of the riemann space , _",
    "e.g.  _ the shape and relative position of the branch disks .",
    "in section  [ rsssolutiongeneral ] we discussed some properties of the moduli space of the bps instantons from the point of view of the riemann space picture .",
    "it would be interesting to have a more complete understanding of the results of  @xcite within the framework proposed in this paper . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the bps equations , with the same boundary conditions considered in this paper , describe domain wall solutions in the @xmath19 sym theory and also the d3-d1 system in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it would be interesting to consider the implications of our results in these contexts .",
    "the matrix model , providing a regularisation of the supermembrane theory , represents the proper framework for a full quantum mechanical calculation of physical transition amplitudes of the type we discussed in this paper .",
    "however , it may be possible to carry out the semi - classical calculation using as starting point the path integral for the continuum supermembrane theory . in the semi - classical approximation the calculation is reduced to an integration over the instanton moduli space .",
    "it may then be possible to introduce an appropriate regularisation , suitable to make the integration over the moduli space of the continuum solutions well defined . in this way an approximate result , valid for large @xmath10 , might be attained working directly with our continuum solutions without reconstructing the explicit form of the corresponding matrix model configurations .",
    "such a possibility is made more plausible by the large amount of supersymmetry in the theory .",
    "the use of this continuum approximation can probably be justified more straightforwardly if indeed the integration over the moduli space is dominated by a saddle point for large @xmath10 .",
    "the study of interactions between m - theory objects using the matrix model formulation has so far been mostly limited to processes involving no longitudinal momentum transfer .",
    "these calculations allow to extract effective supergravity interactions from perturbative calculations in the matrix model .",
    "a comprehensive review of these results and a detailed list of references can be found in  @xcite .",

    "the process studied in  @xcite  described in terms of transfer of a d0-brane between two parallel d2-branes  can be considered as analogous ( in a special kinematical regime ) to the one corresponding to the solution with two membranes in the initial state and two in the final state discussed in section  [ rsssolutiongeneral ]  more specifically the example shown in figure  [ rpmembranescatteringe ] .",
    "however , we emphasise that the approach proposed in this paper is more general , since it allows us to describe processes with an arbitrary number of membranes in the initial and final states",
    ". moreover we can describe interactions involving the exchange of a large amount of longitudinal momentum .",
    "in particular , in cases such as the example shown in figure  [ rpmembranescatteringe ] we have an exchange of a genuine m - theory object , which in the d0-brane picture would require considering a configuration involving a large number of d0-branes . in a calculation of the type presented in  @xcite",
    "this would mean evaluating contributions from sectors with large instanton number .",
    "further work on interactions involving longitudinal momentum transfer was done in  @xcite .",
    "our results on membrane splitting / joining transitions provide a foundation for the systematic study of more general interactions of membranes in m - theory .",
    "the existence of classical solutions corresponding to configurations that interpolate between states containing different numbers of membranes , supports the conclusion that the matrix model is capable of describing splitting / joining interactions , reinforcing the early indications offered by the results of  @xcite . to provide a truly convincing argument it is of course necessary to complete the calculation of the physical transition amplitudes in semi - classical approximation .",
    "moreover , it is important to be able to check the results by independent means and the ads / cft duality of  @xcite provides a way of achieving this .",
    "based on the dictionary for the large @xmath10 sector established in  @xcite , the vertices associated with membrane splitting / joining interactions can be related to correlation functions of monopole operators in the dual cft . as pointed out in  @xcite ,",
    "the use of radial quantisation is a convenient tool for the study of monopole operators and their correlators in the abjm theory .",
    "the relevant monopole operators are analogous to disorder operators in two - dimensional cft .",
    "to compute cft quantities that can be related to membrane interaction vertices one needs to consider amplitudes involving multiple insertions of such operators .",
    "it is an interesting possibility that riemann spaces may be useful for the analysis of correlation functions of this type in the radially quantised abjm theory .",
    "moreover , as is the case for the study of the spectrum  @xcite , the presence of the large parameter @xmath10 should make it possible to develop an approximation scheme allowing a reliable comparison with the matrix model results . a similar approximation , valid in a sector characterised by a large global charge @xmath10 , was recently discussed in  @xcite in the case of a different class of strongly coupled three - dimensional theories .",
    "an alternative way of comparing the effective membrane interaction vertices to the dual cft may be based on the method proposed in  @xcite for string theory in a pp - wave background . in this approach membrane couplings",
    "would be related to matrix elements of the dilation operator of the abjm theory between states associated with monopole operators .",
    "it should be possible to compute such matrix elements in semi - classical approximation , using tunnelling configurations interpolating between monopole states characterised by different gno charges .",
    "it is natural to expect that the nahm equations might play a role in a gauge theory calculation of this type as well .",
    "we note that certain bps equations associated with the description of bound states of m2- and m5-branes in the abjm theory were studied in  @xcite , where interesting relations to the nahm equations were pointed out",
    ".    it would be very interesting to generalise the type of analysis that we developed for the pp - wave matrix model to other cases , relevant for m - theory in different backgrounds .",
    "the cases of the ads@xmath146 and ads@xmath352 spaces are of course of interest . for these backgrounds no matrix model formulation",
    "is known , however , the supermembrane action has been constructed  @xcite .",
    "therefore at least a study of instanton solutions using our approach might be possible , since the continuum version of the instanton equations can be also understood directly from the membrane theory without reference to the matrix model as discussed in section [ rssclassicalmembraneperspective ]  ) may be relevant in view of the interpretation of the change of variables mentioned in footnote [ rfootnotechangevariable ] . ] .",
    "another obvious case to consider is flat space , which may be approached starting from the general pp - wave matrix model described in appendix  [ rsageneralisedformulae ] and using the mass parameter @xmath353 as an infra - red regulator .",

    "it is an intriguing possibility that our results may be an indication of more general features of the dynamics of membranes and that riemann spaces may turn out to be a central ingredient in the description of membrane interactions , in the same way as riemann surfaces are essential in the formulation of string perturbation theory as a genus expansion .",
