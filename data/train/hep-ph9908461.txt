    "thermal dileptons emitted from the fireball in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions might serve as a promising signature for the quark - gluon ( qgp ) formation in such collisions @xcite .",

    ". therefore they can be used as a direct probe for the qgp .",
    "unfortunately there is a huge background coming from hadronic decays .",
    "hence it would be desirable to have some specific features in the dilepton spectrum which could signal the presence of deconfined matter .",
    "indeed perturbative calculations @xcite have shown distinct structures ( van hove singularities , gaps ) in the production rate of low mass dileptons caused by non - trivial in - medium quark dispersion relations",

    "moreover , perturbative calculations of the dilepton rate seem not to converge even in the small coupling limit @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd , on the other hand , is not capable so far to compute dynamical quantities such as the dilepton production rate .",
    "however , lattice calculations provide clear evidence for the existence of non - perturbative effects , e.g. effective parton masses @xcite , hadronic correlators @xcite , and the gluon condensate @xcite , above the phase transition .",
    "recently qcd green functions at finite temperature , which take the presence of a gluon condensate in the qgp into account @xcite , have been constructed .    in the present paper",
    "we will study the influence of this non - perturbative effect on the dilepton production rate .",
    "for this purpose , we will calculate the dilepton rate from the imaginary part of the photon self energy using an effective quark propagator that contain the gluon condensate .",
    "we will find similar structures as in the perturbative case coming from the quark dispersion relation which follows from the pole of the effective quark propagator .",
    "these structures might serve as an unique signature for the presence of deconfined , collective quarks in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .    in the next section",
    "we will shortly review the basic ideas and results for the thermal quark propagator in the presence of a gluon condensate . in section 3",

    "similar to the htl case @xcite the partial rate in the presence of a gluon condensate shows peaks ( van hove singularities ) at different invariant masses of the virtual photon .",

    "the @xmath87 channel terminates at the peak , after which there is a gap because neither of the other processes is possible in this invariant mass regime .",

    "this annihilation process is solely responsible for the dilepton rate .    for @xmath95 @xmath13",
    "the contribution from the plasmino annihilation is nearly as big as the @xmath30-@xmath104-annihilation at the mass regime displayed in fig.4 because of the fairly large deviation of the plasmino branch from the free dispersion relation .",
    "this is the reason why the dilepton rate is almost flat at large masses in fig.5 . only at very large invariant masses",
    "the contribution from @xmath34-@xmath105-annihilation will vanish .",
    "the channel @xmath106 , which contributes in the case of the htl calculation @xcite , is absent here .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that we did not take into account an effective quark - photon vertex .",
    "using such a vertex , ( [ trimpi ] ) does not hold anymore and terms containing @xmath107 show up in ( [ ratep0 ] ) .    comparing our rate to the htl result @xcite for realistic values of the strong coupling constant appearing in the htl rate , e.g. @xmath108 , we observe that our rate is smaller by about a factor of 5 to 10 than the pole - pole contribution of the htl calculation . at large @xmath40",
    "the htl rate reduces to the born rate @xcite @xmath109 which follows from the first term of ( [ ratep0 ] ) in the limit @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "in contrast , the rate given here does not reduce to the born rate in the large @xmath40 limit , since @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 instead of 1 for infinite large momenta .",
    "this can be seen easily from ( [ res ] ) using the asymptotic form of the @xmath114 branch , @xmath115 , discussed in section 2 .",
    "the fact that @xmath112 , which enters the rate ( [ ratep0 ] ) quadratically , is always small causes the suppression of the rate compared to the htl case .",
    "another reason for our small rate might be the fact that we did not take into account an effective quark - photon vertex in our calculation . neglecting this vertex in the htl computation",
    "leads to a reduction of the dilepton rate by a factor 2 to 10 depending on @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , since the spectral densities of the effective quark propagator have no discontinuous parts there is no contribution from cuts as opposed to @xcite . in the htl case the cut contribution , which shows no dramatic structures , dominates over the pole - pole contribution and covers the peaks and gap of the latter completely .",

    "the processes corresponding to @xmath122 and @xmath123 indicate annihilation between a quark ( @xmath84 ) and a plasmino mode ( @xmath85 ) with different momentum to a virtual photon with energy @xmath124 , which were absent at @xmath125 .",

    "as explained for @xmath125 , the contribution from this process grows and dominates over the other processes at large @xmath124 .",

    "the annihilation process between a quark and a plasmino mode becomes active and results in a dip at @xmath158 @xmath13 .",
    "again the second dip around @xmath159 @xmath13 is due to the interplay of the usual annihilation process and annihilation processes involving plasminos .",

    "now the dilepton rate immediately after the gap is rather flat as the contribution from annihilation process involving two plasmino modes has stabilized . at @xmath163 @xmath13",
    "the step like structure in the rate is caused by the onset of the annihilation processes between a quark and a plasmino mode .",
    "the usual annihilation process begins only around @xmath164 @xmath13 , which is not shown in the figure .",
    "finally we want to discuss the neglect of an effective quark - photon vertex and possible observable consequences of our results .",
    "such a vertex , related by the ward identity to the effective quark propagator , should be taken into account when calculating the photon self energy . as a matter of fact ,",
    "in the case of @xmath165-@xmath166-annihilation the consideration of the ward identity lead to a strong suppression of the dilepton production @xcite .",
    "in contrast , taking into account the effective quark - photon vertex in the htl calculation leads to an increase of the rate by a factor 2 to 10 depending on @xmath40 .",
    "unfortunately , the computation of the effective quark - photon vertex and the photon self energy with such a vertex will be very involved .",
    "however , the positions of the singularities and the gap is solely determined by the quark dispersion relation .",
    "our main result is that non - perturbative quark dispersion relations in the qgp lead to sharp structures in the dilepton rate at the positions shown in figs.5 - 8 .",
    "the absolute value of the rate is determined not only by the consideration of the effective quark - photon vertex but also by higher order damping effects which will broaden the peaks . whether these structures can be seen in the dilepton spectrum or not depends on the amount of broadening of the peaks and on the smoothening of these structures by the space - time evolution of the fireball .",
    "furthermore processes involving additional gluons such as compton scattering @xcite and bremsstrahlung @xcite , which lead to a smooth dilepton rate @xcite , and hadronic processes might cover up these structures .",
    "if , however , new structures will be observed in the low mass ( @xmath167 gev ) dilepton spectrum , they will provide a strong indication for the presence of deconfined , collective quarks in the qgp , in particular since the hadronic contribution to the dilepton rate is expected to be smooth due to medium effects @xcite . as a matter of fact , this argument does not depend on a specific approximation scheme @xcite as the general behavior ( two branches , common effective mass , plasmino minimum , free dispersion at large momenta ) of the quark dispersion agrees with the one shown in fig.1 - 3 and found in ref.@xcite . although such structures have not been observed so far due to the small life time of the qgp phase at sps ( if it exists at all ) as indicated by hydrodynamical calculation @xcite , it will be worthwhile to look for new structures in the low mass dilepton spectrum ( in particular at low photon momenta ) at rhic and lhc , where the thermal dilepton spectrum is expected to be dominated by the qgp phase .",
