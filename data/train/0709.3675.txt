    "in eukaryotic cells , microtubules ( mt ) are one type of cytoskeletal filaments , which perform several roles : they serve as tracks for intracellular molecular motor transport , provide structural rigidity to the cell and assemble to form a spindle during metaphase for the purpose of separation of duplicated chromosomes to the mother and daughter cells .",
    "mt are highly dynamic . in _ in vitro _ situations , it is observed that a growing mt can suddenly start shrinking ; this `` catastrophe '' is triggered by the loss of the gtp cap by hydrolysis of gtp molecules attached to the tubulin subunits of mt .",
    "a shrinking mt occasionally get `` rescued '' and start polymerizing again .",
    "this unusual process of polymerization and depolymerization is referred to as ` dynamic instability '  @xcite .",
    "the situation inside the living cell is much more complex and the mt kinetics _ in vivo _ is regulated by many proteins . in particular , several motor proteins belonging to the kinesin family are now known to function as mt depolymerizers  @xcite and are crucial in the formation and maintenance of the mitotic spindle  @xcite .",
    "these include xkcm1/mcak ( mitotic centromere - associated kinesin ) and kif2a belonging to the kinesin-13 family and kip3 proteins belonging to kinesin-8 family .",
    "mcak is known to be active at kinetochores ( the protein structure which facilitates mt attachment to chromosomes ) , whereas kif2a is associated with centrosomes and kip3p regulates microtubule - cortical interactions .",
    "depletion / inhibition of xkcm1/mcak has been shown to affect spindle length and the poleward motion of chromosomes during anaphase , while deletion of kinesin-8 proteins leads to defects in positioning of the spindle@xcite . however , the mechanism of depolymerization of mt by these motor proteins is only incompletely understood  @xcite .",
    "recent _ in vitro _",
    "depolymerization experiments with surface - immobilized mt have demonstrated that the depolymerizing kinesins mcak  @xcite and kip3p  @xciteuse a ` reduction of dimensionality ' mechanism to target the mt tips for depolymerization : after binding non - specifically to the mt surface , these proteins use diffusion ( mcak ) or directed walk ( kip3p ) to reach the tip(s ) , and their accumulation induces depolymerization of the mt from the tip .",
    "the depolymerization rate is , in general , length and motor - concentration dependent ; in addition , mcak and kip3p are found to have vastly different residence times on the mt .",
    "these results indicate that depolymerizing kinesins could be used by the cell for precise length regulation of microtubules .",
    "the central question of interest for us here is : what is the nature of the length - distribution of a set of microtubules in steady state , in a solution of free tubulin and depolymerizing motor proteins ( henceforth referred to as _",
    "depolymerizers _ for brevity ) ?",
    "in particular , it is important to understand how the depolymerizers contribute to the formation of a highly ordered structure such as the metaphase spindle , where most of the mt would need to be close to the spindle length .",
    "this aspect becomes significant , if we recall that the steady state length distribution of a set of microtubules undergoing dynamic instability under standard _ in vitro _ conditions has an exponentially decaying form , without any preferred length  @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we present a theoretical framework for understanding the depolymerizing activity of a generic motor protein as described above . after deriving expressions for the concentration profile of bound motors on a mt",
    ", we calculate the rate of absorption of motors at the mt tips .",
    "we then construct the rate equations for the length distribution(s ) of mt , which are then solved perturbatively in the limits of low and high motor concentrations .",
    "we also show that the model can be used to analyze available experimental data on motor - induced depolymerization .",
    "since we are interested in length - related properties , we consider here mt of finite length ( unlike earlier theoretical approaches  @xcite to the problem , which concentrated on semi - infinite mt ) . in our model ,",
    "a depolymerizer binds to a mt at a rate @xmath0 per unit length ( @xmath1 being the depolymerizer concentration in solution ) , and detaches at a rate @xmath2 .",
    "a bound generic depolymerizer undergoes a biased random walk with drift speed @xmath3 and diffusion coefficient @xmath4 . once a depolymerizer reaches a tip of the mt , it depolymerizes the filament at a rate @xmath5 ( measured in @xmath6 m min@xmath7 ) while remaining attached to the tip .",
    "the depolymerizers accumulate at the tip , and detach from there at a rate @xmath8 , which characterizes its _ processivity_(the tendency to stay attached to the mt tip while depolymerizing it ) .",
    "the tips , therefore , act as sinks for the depolymerizers which could accumulate there . the net rate of depolymerization , @xmath9 , is a stochastic quantity , and depends on the number of accumulated motors .",
    "we further assume that a gtp cap is always present at a mt tip so that a depolymerizer - free tip will grow at a rate @xmath10 by adding tubulin sub - units ( i.e. , gtp hydrolysis is assumed to be sufficiently slow ) .",
    "an illustration of the model is provided in fig .",
    ".    the mt - bound depolymerizer density profile will be denoted by @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the length of the mt at time @xmath14 .",
    "the kinetics of @xmath11 , in a frame of reference attached to the moving mt tip is given by the equation ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 for a growing mt and @xmath18 for a shrinking mt .",
    "note that steric exclusion effects between motors have been neglected here for simplicity .",
    "in general , @xmath3 depends on @xmath19 ; however , at sufficiently small @xmath19 , modification of the last term of eq.([eq1 ] ) to incorporate steric exclusion is equivalent to addition of just a constant to the detachment rate @xmath2@xcite .",
    "so far as the surface transport on the mt is concerned , the mt tips act as `` traps '' for the depolymerases ; however , a depolymerase can escape from the `` trap '' only by detachment from the mt during its mt - depolymerizing activity .",
    "therefore , we treat the kinetics of the tip - absorbed motor population separately from the mt surface - bound ( mobile ) density of motors .",
    "the boundary conditions on @xmath11 , which are needed to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , should reflect the `` trapping '' of motors at the tips , and the simplest case is absorbing boundary conditions : @xmath20 for all @xmath14 . using time - independent boundary conditions",
    "requires that length fluctuations due to growth / shrinkage are sufficiently small , and the conditions for the same are derived now .",
    "we consider the @xmath21 case first .",
    "a single motor typically spends a residence time @xmath22 on a sufficiently long mt ( @xmath23 ) , or otherwise gets absorbed at a tip within a shorter time interval @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , only those motors that bind to the mt within a ` depletion zone ' of length @xmath25 from a tip get absorbed at the tip , within a time interval @xmath26 , the rest will get detached before they can reach the tip .",

    "directed walk with velocity @xmath3 , the corresponding condition turns out to be @xmath32 .",
