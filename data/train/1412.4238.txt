    "a single electron spin in a self - assembled quantum dot ( qd ) is a promising candidate for a solid - state qubit @xcite . in particular",
    ", the large optical dipole enables the electron spin to be initialized @xcite , manipulated @xcite and read - out @xcite using fast optical techniques .",
    "however , the coupling of the electron spin to the nuclear spin bath of the qd via the hyperfine interaction leads to rapid spin dephasing @xcite .",
    "a hole spin represents an alternative @xcite . for a heavy - hole spin ,",
    "the coefficient describing the hyperfine interaction is about one tenth that of the electron spin @xcite , and , owing to the spin @xmath10 bloch states , highly anisotropic such that dephasing via the nuclear spins can be suppressed with an in - plane magnetic field @xcite .",
    "hole spin dephasing times @xmath11 in ingaas qds in excess of 100 ns have been measured in small in - plane magnetic fields @xcite ( although they appear to be smaller at high magnetic fields @xcite ) and the decoherence time @xmath12 is in the microsecond regime @xcite .",
    "the possibilities for manipulating the hole spin in a self - assembled quantum dot electrically have been explored theoretically @xcite but not yet experimentally .",
    "we demonstrate here that the hole g - factor in a quantum dot is very sensitive to an electric field @xmath13 ( along the growth direction , @xmath1 ) when the magnetic field @xmath14 is applied in - plane , the magnetic field direction required to generate a coherent hole spin . on the one hand ,",
    "the sensitivity to electric field implies that charge noise results in hole spin dephasing @xcite .",
    "however , with quiet electrical devices , for instance the ones used here , this limitation can be overcome . on the other hand ,",
    "the result opens a powerful way to fast electrical control of the hole spin by the g - tensor modulation technique @xcite : the @xmath0- and @xmath1-dependencies are different .",
    "the predicted hole spin coupling via ac electric field modulation of the g - tensor with a sige quantum dot is @xmath15 mhz @xcite .",
    "even larger couplings are predicted based on the results presented here .",
    "recently there have been theoretical @xcite as well as experimental @xcite studies concerning the g - factor tensor and its tunability for ingaas qds . in this paper",
    "we augment the measurement methods for determining the g - factor by using resonant laser spectroscopy with resonance fluorescence ( rf ) detection @xcite .",
    "the method has higher resolution than the detection of photoluminescence following non - resonant excitation .",
    "furthermore , non - resonant excitation introduces not only electrical noise @xcite and hole spin dephasing @xcite but also creates space charge which screens the applied electric field .",
    "these problems are resolved with purely resonant excitation .",
    "we are able to combine our high resolution resonance fluorescence experiment with a k@xmath8p theory to support our experimental results .",
    "the k@xmath8p analysis demonstrates that the origin of the large dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath3 arises from the soft hole confinement potential ( allowing the  center of gravity \" of the hole spin wave function to shift in a vertical electric field ) , an indium concentration gradient ( the effective hole  composition \" depends on electric field ) , and a strong dependence of the material parameters ( notably the luttinger parameter @xmath16 ) on indium concentration .",

    "the electric field displaces the electron and the hole wave functions inside the qd , by values up to about 0.6 nm in this experiment .",

    "it is well known that one of the key parameters describing the hole g - factor , the luttinger @xmath16-parameter , is highly dependent on indium concentration , changing from for 1.1 gaas to 7.6 for inas @xcite . in the simplest approximation",

    "independent of material considerations , the lack of useful quantization limits the maximum confinement length , taken as 5 nm here .",
    "significantly , for a realistic quantum dot confinement length of a few nm , the calculations are in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "in fact agreement is excellent for a confinement length of 2.4 nm which is realistic for these qds ( green line ) , fig .",

    "the total magnetic field corresponds to 3.2 ( 4.6 ) t. these parameters are very reasonable in the sense that the magnetic field is not particularly high and that it lies predominantly in - plane , as required to decouple the heavy - hole spin from the nuclear spins .",

    "the origin of the strong electric field dependence arises from a combination of the softness of hole confining potential , an indium concentration gradient and a strong dependence of material parameters on indium concentration .",
    "a quantum dot hole spin becomes coherent in an in - plane magnetic field . on the one hand ,",
    "the large @xmath56 implies that charge noise results in hole spin dephasing .",
    "this can be minimized of course by working in the clean - material , low - temperature , resonant - excitation limit @xcite .",
    "another option , as shown by the theoretical calculations , is to work with shallow quantum dots for which @xmath56 is small . on the other hand ,",
    "the large @xmath56 is useful : g - tensor modulation via an ac electric field can be used to drive spin rotations . with the present quantum dots we predict that the spin can be rotated at frequencies up to @xmath9 ghz .",

    "<S> we report a large g - factor tunability of a single hole spin in an ingaas quantum dot via an electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field lies in the in - plane direction @xmath0 , the direction required for a coherent hole spin . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical field lies along the growth direction @xmath1 and is changed over a large range , 100 kv / cm . both electron and hole g - factors are determined by high resolution laser spectroscopy with resonance fluorescence detection . </S>",
    "<S> this , along with the low electrical - noise environment , gives very high quality experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the hole g - factor @xmath2 depends linearly on the electric field @xmath3 , @xmath4 cm / kv , whereas the electron g - factor @xmath5 is independent of electric field , @xmath6 cm / kv ( results averaged over a number of quantum dots ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath3 is well reproduced by a @xmath7 k@xmath8p model demonstrating that the electric field sensitivity arises from a combination of soft hole confining potential , an in concentration gradient and a strong dependence of material parameters on in concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the electric field sensitivity of the hole spin can be exploited for electrically - driven hole spin rotations via the g - tensor modulation technique and based on these results , a hole spin coupling as large as @xmath9 ghz is expected to be envisaged . </S>"
