    "the presence of a circumstellar dust disk around a mature , main - sequence star is interpreted as a visible signpost of a planetary system @xcite .",
    "these discs are the remnants of asteroidal and cometary bodies broken up in mutual collisions and so are commonly known as ` debris discs ' @xcite .",
    "debris discs are comprised of icy and rocky bodies ranging from sub - micron sized dust grains to kilometre sized planetesimals , analogous to the solar system s asteroid belt and edgeworth - kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "between 20 and 30 per cent of nearby , main - sequence afgk - type stars have been identified as hosting cool debris disks , with fractional luminosities ( @xmath3 ) ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the observed disk incidence is sensitivity limited , with current instrumentation unable to directly detect a disk of equivalent brightness to the edgeworth - kuiper belt around another star ( @xmath6 * ? ? ?",

    "the debris disk around hd  76582 was identified by detection of infrared excess from the star at 60  @xmath0 m in the all - sky survey by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "its fractional luminosity of @xmath7 , estimated from a single temperature blackbody fit with a temperature of 80  k @xcite , is consistent with a steady - state collisional cascade according to the evolutionary models of @xcite assuming an age of @xmath8 0.5  gyr @xcite .",
    "however , if the age of @xmath8 2  gyr from @xcite is considered , then the disk appears to be unusually bright .",
    "images at longer wavelengths trace larger and colder dust grains , making them useful in identifying the location of the dust producing planetesimal belts around a disk - host star @xcite . additionally , ( sub-)millimetre wavelength observations are ideal for probing asymmetric structures formed by resonance - trapped dust grains in disks , possibly caused by perturbing planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the data presented here are low signal - to - noise ( 5 - 10-@xmath9 integrated detection ) and the disk is unresolved .",
    "the sub - millimetre data are critical to the disk modelling process , constraining the dust particle size distribution from the sed s sub - millimetre slope for the first time , and providing a measure of the dust mass in the system .",
    "the _ spitzer_/irs spectrum , spanning mid - infrared wavelengths , reveals the presence of a second , warm component to this disk @xcite .",
    "debris disks with spectral energy distributions ( seds ) exhibiting two distinct temperatures are inferred to comprise two physically distinct planetesimal rings that produce the dust at different temperatures @xcite .",
    "a favoured mechanism invoked for keeping the space between the two planetesimal rings free of migrating dust is the presence of one ( or more ) planet(s ) @xcite .",
    "determination of the architectures of these systems solely from their seds is limited by the contrast between the warm and cool dust components @xcite .",
    "such interpretation is crude , and even combining the sed with moderately resolved disk images can not always provide a clear architecture from modelling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "high angular resolution images are therefore critical to interpretation of these systems .    in this work",
    "we combine these disparate data to produce a self - consistent and coherent model of the disk s architecture and evolutionary state . in section 2",
    "we present the observations used to model this system , including the new scuba-2 sub - millimetre images and ancillary data from the literature . in section 3",
    "we present a summary of the simultaneous modelling of imaging and photometric data . in section 4",
    "we discuss the outcomes of the modelling process , interpreting the properties of hd  76582 s disk as part of the ensemble of known debris disks . finally in section 5",

    "hd  76582 ( hip  44001 , @xmath10 cnc ) is an f0  iv type star located at a distance of 46.13  @xmath11  0.69  pc .",

    "the rotational velocity @xmath16 and the rotational period ( modulo the unknown stellar inclination ) @xmath17 are taken from @xcite .",

    "we find that an outer disk comprised of two narrow annuli at @xmath2080  au and @xmath21270  au adequately replicates the disk structure . for the dust properties , a minimum grain size of 10  @xmath0 m for the 80  au annulus and 36  @xmath0 m for the 270  au annulus",
    "are obtained ; this result is tied to the need for the cooler ( outer ) annulus to match the steep sub - millimetre sed without contributing too strongly to the far - infrared part of the sed at 60 and 100  @xmath0 m .",
    "the particle size distribution is again found to be significantly steeper than for a steady - state case with @xmath22 but this is also dictated by the sub - millimetre slope .",
    "our modelling of hd  76582 s disk has shown evidence for three distinct physical components in the disk .",
    "excesses at both mid- and far - infrared wavelengths , requiring disk components at two distinct temperatures , are often interpreted as evidence for physically distinct planetesimals belts in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as seen above , the disk s observational properties can be adequately replicated by a multi - annular architecture . however",
    ", a broad outer disk , over 150  au in extent , can not replicate both the sed and the extended emission seen in the 100  @xmath0 m _ herschel _ images , and it would likewise be difficult to justify from a dynamical perspective .",
    "we therefore favour the multi - annular interpretation suggesting the outer disk structure has two distinct and physically separate components along with a spatially unresolved inner component .",
    "however , images with low spatial resolution provide little constraint to the inner parts of the system ; a clear physical separation between the inner and outer system is not conclusively shown in these data .",
    "it might well be that the disk is a single contiguous structure around the star , but with several regions with different properties ( as we expect a radial variation in the particle size distribution of dust ) .",
    "multi - annular structures have previously been inferred in this manner for the debris disks around e.g. @xmath23 leo @xcite , @xmath24 dor @xcite , and hd  23484 ( hip  17439 , * ? ? ?",
    "the resolved outer disk extent is approximately twice the blackbody radial extent ( @xmath25 ) . for a star of @xmath8  10  @xmath26 ,",
    "the ratio of observed disk radius to blackbody radius , @xmath27 , is expected to lie around 3.5 ( fig .",
    "10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations by _ herschel _ show a range of values for @xmath27 up to @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the disk therefore lies closer to the blackbody radius than theoretical expectations , suggesting that the dominant grains responsible for far - infrared emission are larger than the blow out radius ( @xmath28 m ) but not large enough to radiate as blackbodies .",
    "this result is consistent with the minimum grain size ( @xmath29 m ) derived in the modelling process .",
    "a typical particle size distribution exponent in the range 3 to 4 is inferred for those debris discs that have been detected at ( sub-)millimetre wavelengths @xcite .",
    "such values are consistent with a steady - state collisional cascade and expected values derived from collisional modelling ( 3.5 to 3.7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", we find an exponent of 5 is required to replicate the sed s sub - millimetre slope .",
    "this , in combination with the minimum grain size from the model @xmath30 being 36  @xmath0 m ( for the outer disk ) , implies the disk ( at least in its outer regions ) is dominated by moderately - sized dust grains .",
    "such properties are reminiscent of the peculiar `` steep sed '' debris discs detected at far - infrared wavelengths by @xcite , that have comparable ages ( @xmath8300  myr ) to that quoted for hd  76582 ( at the lower end ) , and may therefore represent analogous systems to this one , albeit much fainter ( @xmath31 ) . for disks around luminous stars ,",
    "the minimum grain size infered from modelling tends to approach the blowout radius @xcite .",
    "the mid- and far - infrared excesses preclude the presence of small grains , below @xmath8  10  @xmath0 m , contributing to the observed emission as that would increase the disk brightness too much at wavelengths @xmath32  100  @xmath0 m .",
    "the minimum grain size infered for the outer parts of this system is thus some 3 to 10 times larger than the blowout radius , 3.7  @xmath0 m , derived from radiation pressure arguments @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath30 in the outer disk derived from the astronomical silicate model are large ( 10  @xmath0 m and 36  @xmath0 m ) .",
    "this seems to contradict the high value for @xmath23 found in fitting the modified blackbody model which would imply a large amount of small grains . comparing the results from the astronomical silicate model , with large grains and a steep size distribution , and the modified blackbody model , with the high beta value , both point towards a disk where",
    "its emission is being dominated by the smallest grains . for a more typical disk , a shallower size distribution ( in the astronomical silicate model )",
    "would broaden the shape of the far - infrared excess and decrease the beta value ( for the modified blackbody case ) .",
    "these modelling outcomes can be reconciled by noting that the grains simply need to be inefficient emitters to replicate the sub - mm slope , and that the observed emission is dominated by the smallest grains in the disk ( which may not necessarily be small themselves ) .",
    "a further avenue of investigation is the adoption of a different material for the disk s constituent dust grains .",
    "given the broad parameter space opened by relaxing the condition of a single ( pure astronomical silicate ) dust composition it is not unreasonable to expect that some combination of materials ( and porosity ) such as water ice might replicate the disk sed .",
    "however , the modelling process is limited such that any multi - material composition found to replicate the sed in this way would exceed the number of available free parameters .",
    "that being said , diligence requires us to address that possibility here .",
    "we may attempt to fit the sed using dust grains of different properties whilst keeping the constraint of the disk architecture derived from fitting the images .",
    "three alternative materials to astronomical silicate are considered : amorphous water ice @xcite , ` dirty ice ' @xcite , and graphite @xcite .",
    "the optical constants for these materials were taken from the jena database .",
    "we found that none of the materials could replicate the sed with an appreciably shallower size distribution or smaller minimum grain size than the results obtained for astronomical silicate grains , and we therefore do not devote any further efforts to presentation of these results .",
    "whilst this approach is non - exhaustive , it demonstrates that the disk properties calculated in this work are not a quirk of adopting standard assumptions regarding the dust grain properties",
    ".    given its unusual properties , we may consider the evolutionary state of the disk ; is it actually in a state of flux , or are its properties consistent with a steady - state evolution ? to do this , we compare the fractional luminosity of hd  76582 s disk to the models presented in @xcite , whereby the maximum brightness , @xmath33 , for a disk around an a star of a given age can be calculated , under certain assumptions ( their eqns . 14 , 20 ) .",
    "hd  76582 s disk has fractional luminosities of 3.1@xmath34 for the warm disk ( blackbody ) , and 1.45@xmath35 and 5.4@xmath34 for the two annuli in the cool disk . adopting a separation of @xmath36au for the blackbody component , and @xmath3780  au and @xmath38270  au for the outer two components we can consider these regions separately .",
    "given an age of 0.45  gyr , @xmath39 is 1.8@xmath34 , whereas for an age of 2.13  gyr , @xmath39 is 3.9@xmath40 . for the outer system , at 0.45  gyr @xmath41 and @xmath42 , whereas at 2.13  gyr @xmath43 and @xmath44 . given the large uncertainties on the calculation of @xmath33 @xcite , this does not conclusively show that the system is brighter than expected for steady state collisional evolution . nonetheless , taken together with the steep dust size distribution and large minimum grain size",
    ", this does leave open the possibility that hd  76582 s disk is not in a quiescent state and is in the process of some dynamical upheaval revealed through its unusual dust emission .",
    "the outermost parts of the disk still having a brightness compatible with steady state evolution , would be expected with this scenario as the collisional timescales will be greater there .    a further issue in examining the state of hd  76582 s disk is the evolutionary state of the host star .",
    "as an f0  iv sub - giant , the star is undergoing mass loss via a strong stellar wind .",
    "the impact of stellar winds on debris disks on the main sequence has been investigated in @xcite , where no difference in excess detection rate between early and late f - type stars was seen , suggesting the stellar winds had little impact on the circumstellar debris . around sub - giant stars ,",
    "disks have been examined by e.g. @xcite . for these post - main sequence disks",
    "@xcite calculated that the disk survives the evolution process but the increased luminosity of the evolved host is more effective at removing smaller grains through radiation pressure . however , the impact of the stellar wind on the disk was negligible over the range of systems studied , as per the main sequence",
    ".    in the case of hd  76582 , the multi - annular structure of the disk speaks to the presence of massive , unseen bodies in the intervening gaps .",
    "as a host star undergoes mass loss on the giant branch , the semi - major axes of companion bodies will expand outwards by a factor of two to three in the adiabatic case @xcite .",
    "an exoplanet ( or large planetesimals ) migrating outward in this fashion would stir the planetesimal belts , brightening the disk through increased dust production from collisions .",
    "as a subgiant , the amount of mass loss from hd  76582 is small and the impact of this on the orbits of circumstellar bodies would therefore be modest .    to resolve the issue of the disk structure satisfactorially ,",
    "further high angular resolution images are required .",
    "two obvious approaches are through ( sub-)mm interferometry or scattered light imaging at optical / near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "however , the hd  76582 system presents a challenge in this regard . in the case of sub - mm",
    "follow up , the precipitous drop of the sub - mm excess reduces the integrated flux for the disk to 1.1  mjy at 1300  @xmath0 m .",
    "confining this flux to be spread in two annuli within a radial extent of @xmath8  6 , and assuming a beam fwhm of 1.5(to separate the two outer annuli ) , requires a total of 10 beams to cover the disk area .",
    "an observation with s / n @xmath8 10/beam is feasible with currently available facilities , such as alma .",
    "the case for scattered light imaging is more difficult , despite the disk being relatively bright , as the conversion between thermal and scattered excess is highly uncertain @xcite .",
    "the large minimum grain size inferred by our model also counts against the feasibility of such a measurement as comparably bright disks with such large grains have been found to be difficult to image , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we present the first sub - millimetre detection of the debris disk around hd  76582 , along with spatially resolved far - infrared images .",
    "measurement of the spectral slope at 450 and 850  @xmath0 m reveals a steep fall - off of the disk sed at sub - millimetre wavelengths inconsistent with values observed , and predicted , for typical disks .",
    "we combine these new observations with available photometry and images at far - infrared wavelengths to constrain the disk s geometry and extent , and the dust grain properties in a self - consistent model that simultaneously fits all available data .",
    "hd  76582 s disk has a position angle of 103  and an inclination of 64 .",
    "the disk modelling favours three physically separate components : an unresolved component at @xmath4520  au responsible for the mid - infrared excess , and two annuli at 80 and 270  au responsible for the far - infrared excess .",
    "the steep size distribution , @xmath46 , large minimum grain size , @xmath4710  @xmath0 m , and fractional luminosity of the disk , @xmath48 , lead us to infer that we do not observe the hd  76582 system in a steady state .",
