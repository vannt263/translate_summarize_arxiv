    "a line source or sink is often encountered in electromagnetic and biological problems when a long and thin structure is involved .",
    "for instance , a distribution of electric charge on a curve can be represented by a line source @xcite .",
    "a flexible structure such as an elastic fiber or filament is modeled as a line source in immersed boundary method to address the mechanical interactions between the structure and biofluid @xcite .",
    "a very thin blood capillary in a bulk tumor can be treated as a line source when modeling a growth factor s reaction and diffusion @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the line source is considered as a simple smooth curve @xmath0 , embedded in the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) euclidean space @xmath1 or its generalization .",
    "denote the arc length parameter by @xmath2 and the corresponding spatial point on this curve by @xmath3 .",
    "the line delta function @xmath4 associated with the curve @xmath0 is defined as a distribution such that for any test function @xmath5 ( i.e. , infinitely differentiable and compactly supported ) , @xmath6 in cartesian coordinates , by formally switching the order of integrations ( i.e. applying `` fubini s theorem '' ) , it can be understood as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) dirac delta function satisfying @xmath11 for any @xmath12 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide an alternative representation of the line delta function @xmath13 for a fairly general class of spatial curves sufficient for most practical applications , which is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the distance function to the curve .",
    "this @xmath16 function is under the convention that @xmath17 for any @xmath12 .",
    "the main challenge is to how to make sense of and calculate @xmath18 for any @xmath19 . for this",
    ", one has to choose the most reasonable and practical coordinate system .",
    "indeed , the apparently singular term @xmath20 on the right hand side comes naturally from the local cylindrical coordinates in a tubular neighbourhood near the curve .",
    "if the curve @xmath0 is simple and smooth , then a tubular neighbourhood can be readily chosen where the distance function works as the radius and will be cancelled out in coordinate transformation .",
    "this will be done in section 2 . in general ,",
    "if the curve has non - smooth points , we have to make the meaning of @xmath21 more clear , which will be done in section 3 . as application",
    ", the formula works for very complicated structure composed by piecewise smooth curves such as the newly formed blood capillary network in growing tumor , as shown in fig.[tumor_vasculature ] .",
    "another important application of this work is in the level set method .",
    "the delta function of a curve or a surface represented by a level set function is crucial in the level set method @xcite , but the form for a spatial curve is not previously available .",
    "the formula provides the first representation with the distance function , whose generalization to an arbitrary level set function will be given in section 4 .",
    "the extension to plane curves and general submanifolds with co - dimension 1 and 2 are also discussed in section 4 .",
    "the essential tool in our calculation of @xmath21 is the knowledge of a neighbourhood around the curve .",
    "the standard tubular neighbourhood theorem is for compact smooth submanifolds of @xmath22 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore",
    ", when it is applied to a curve , the curve needs to be a submanifold of @xmath1 and is diffeomorphic to a circle .",
    "however , because of the local nature of our problem , it can be readily applied to any simple smooth curve which is a submanifold of @xmath1 .",
    "more detail is as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simple smooth curve with the arc length parameter @xmath2 , any point on the curve denoted as @xmath3 .",
    "look at a finite piece of it with @xmath23 $ ] , for simplicity , still denoted as @xmath0 .",
    "it is a closed set in @xmath1 with the two endpoints @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "denote @xmath26 as the interior part by removing the two endpoints of the curve @xmath0 . on each point @xmath27 ,",
    "denote the tangent space as @xmath28 which is exerted by @xmath29 .",
    "define the normal plane as @xmath30 .",
    "on the two endpoints @xmath24 and @xmath25 , define tangent and normal planes as the limits of those of points in @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the open ball centered at @xmath24 with radius @xmath32 , and @xmath33 be the open semi - ball of @xmath31 cut by the normal plane @xmath34 which is disjoint with @xmath26 .",
    "similarly we can define @xmath35 .",
    "define the tubular neighbourhood @xmath36 which is the set of all points within distance @xmath32 to @xmath0 but excluding the two outside semi - balls at the two ends of the curve .",
    "note @xmath34 and @xmath37 are two bounding normal planes of this tube ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) . also define @xmath38 let @xmath39 be given by @xmath40 .",
    "the following is a standard result in differential geometry .",
    "[ lem1 ] there exists @xmath41 such that the map @xmath42 is a diffeomorphism from @xmath43 onto @xmath44 .",
    "[ rmk1 ] a prominent feature of this tubular neighbourhood is that @xmath45 , @xmath46 where the vector @xmath47 is from the unique decomposition @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "also notice that for our curve of infinite length , one might not have a uniform @xmath32 for the whole curve , but this is not going to give us any trouble in this work because only pieces of finite length will be considered in the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "define the distance function to @xmath0 as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the standard euclidean distance .",
    "@xmath52 implies @xmath53 because the curve @xmath0 is embedded in @xmath1 ( i.e. being a submanifold ) .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath0 be a simple smooth curve embedded in @xmath1 , then @xmath54    _ * proof .",
    "* _ around any point on @xmath0 , we have a tubular neighbourhood @xmath44 satisfying the condition in lemma [ lem1 ] .",
    "first , a coordinate system will be constructed in @xmath44 as follows . on the curve @xmath0",
    ", @xmath55 is a unit vector field . because the curve is smooth , there exist two other smooth unit vector fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 such that @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath55 form an orthonormal system and satisfy the right hand rule . on each normal plane @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 provide a @xmath59 coordinate system , @xmath60 .",
    "denote any point on this plane as @xmath61 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) . according to remark [ rmk1 ] , @xmath62 .    because @xmath63 is a smooth frame along the curve ,",
    "the map from @xmath64 to @xmath65 is smooth .",
    "the jacobian between @xmath65 and @xmath64 is the determinant of the transition matrix between the @xmath1 standard basis @xmath66 and @xmath67 which is just @xmath68 when restricted on the curve .",
    "although @xmath69 is not explicit away from the curve , the transition matrix has to be in @xmath70 on the curve because it is between two orthonormal bases with the same ( right - handed ) orientation .",
    "so the determinant is @xmath71 on the curve .",
    "as the jacobian is smooth in the tubular neighbourhood @xmath72 , it s @xmath73 in sight of the taylor series .",
    "thus the jacobian must be nonzero in a sufficiently small neighbourhood , say , @xmath74 . for simplicity , it is still denoted as @xmath72 . therefore , @xmath64 is a coordinate system in @xmath72 .",
    "when converted to the polar version @xmath75 , since @xmath76 , it is easy to see @xmath77    for any test function @xmath5 , @xmath18 only depends on the situation near @xmath0 as @xmath78 is supported on @xmath0 . since @xmath79 is compactly supported , we can assume that it is supported in a ball @xmath80 . because @xmath81 is compact , there exist finitely many local tubular neighbourhoods centered at involved pieces of @xmath0 covering @xmath81 , denoted as @xmath82 .",
    "we can also make sure that @xmath83 with @xmath84 also covers @xmath81 .",
    "now a stardard partition of unity construction provides us with @xmath85 such that @xmath86 when restricted to @xmath87 .",
    "finally , we can carry out the following computation .",
    "@xmath88 in sight of the definition in eq .",
    ", the theorem is proven .",
    "@xmath89 +    [ rmk2 ] the choice of coordinates does not have to be fixed and is actually flexible .",
    "however , we do need to start with a euclidean orthonormal basis along @xmath0 with one vector in the direction of the curve . in short ,",
    "the delta function would function on the normal plane of the curve with the euclidean structure induced from @xmath1 .",
    "with a proper understanding of the delta function , the previous argument can be adjusted to a general class of curves which are topological graphs with smooth edges .",
    "the graph can have infinite vertices with finite edges between any two of them and the edges need not be straight ( i.e. being topological ) .",
    "we only need to require that there is no local `` accumulation '' happening , which is in general what people think of graphs .",
    "let @xmath0 be such a curve .",
    "the whole curve @xmath0 may be closed or open , may have non - smooth points and self - intersections , and may have more than one connected components ( see fig.[allcurves ] ) .",
    "denote the collection of all non - smooth points as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a finite or countable index set . to handle these non - smooth points",
    ", we remove from @xmath0 a small neighbourhood in @xmath1 around each such point such that the boundary of the neighbourhood is perpendicular to the curve at the point of intersection .",
    "denote the union of these neighbourhoods by @xmath92 and shrink @xmath92 to @xmath93 as @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath95 be the characteristic function of @xmath96 , i.e. , @xmath97 over @xmath92 and @xmath71 otherwise .",
    "the following definition is what we want : @xmath98 notice that @xmath99 can be understood in the same way as before because a neighbourhood of the non - smooth points has essentially been removed .",
    "the limit is in the weak sense , i.e. in the sense of current , with the existence justified by the following computation . for any @xmath100 ,",
    "@xmath101 the first equality makes use of the same kind of computation as that in the previous section , i.e. , using a partition of unity construction to reduce to local tubular neighbourhoods with cylindrical coordinates .",
    "this is done for each @xmath32 and the local tubular neighbourhoods only need to cover @xmath102 .",
    "this also shows the independence of the choice ( on @xmath95 ) in the construction . simply speaking , there is no contribution from @xmath93 in integration . in summary , we have proven the following main theorem .",
    "[ thm2 ] let @xmath0 be a topological graph in @xmath1 with smooth edges and @xmath103 be the distance function to @xmath0 .",
    "then the definition makes sense and @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath105 be a non - negative level set function of @xmath0 , that is , @xmath106 .",
    "assume @xmath105 is a function , @xmath107 , locally near @xmath0 in the coordinate system used before , and @xmath108 around @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath105 is non - negative , we have actually assumed @xmath109 .",
    "this implies @xmath110 can be viewed as a generalized cylindrical coordinate system locally near @xmath0 , and the jacobian between it and @xmath75 is @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , we have the following result .",
    "let @xmath0 be a topological graph in @xmath1 with smooth edges , @xmath103 be the distance function to @xmath0 , and @xmath112 be a non - negative level set function of @xmath0 as above , then @xmath113 .",
    "the key is that @xmath114 . for non - smooth points",
    ", one can have similar discussion as in section 3 .",
    "analogous to theorem 2 and 3 , we can obtain the following results for plane curves .",
    "let @xmath0 be a topological graph in @xmath59 with smooth edges , @xmath103 be the distance function to @xmath0 , and @xmath112 be a non - negative level set function of @xmath0 , with @xmath115 is uniformly bounded away from 0 , then @xmath116 .",
    "we only need to prove the level set formulation for a simple smooth curve @xmath0 embedded in @xmath59 .",
    "we use the 2-d coordinates @xmath117 in the tubular neighourhood @xmath56 around @xmath0 . over @xmath0 , @xmath118 as @xmath119 over @xmath0 , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are orthonormal vectors in the direction of @xmath122 and @xmath55 , respectively . then over @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath123 ) ,",
    "take any test function @xmath125 , @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the jacobian between the euclidean coordinate and @xmath117 , which is equal to @xmath71 along @xmath0 because @xmath122 and @xmath55 form an orthonormal basis there .    for theorem 3 ,",
    "@xmath128 is not well - defined as a function over @xmath0 in general because of the presence of @xmath42 , and should be understood in the integration sense . because we do not have @xmath42 for a neighbourhood of a curve in @xmath59 , this is not an issue for theorem 4 .    in the 3-d case ,",
    "a succinct formula like @xmath129 does not hold in general .",
    "indeed , in 3-d cylindrical coordinates , @xmath130 near @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , when approaching @xmath0 , @xmath128 can not be replaced by @xmath131 unless @xmath132 , which puts restriction on this level set function @xmath105 .",
    "the study here can be extended to the general case of a submanifold , @xmath0 , of co - dimension 2 or 1 in @xmath133 with @xmath134 ( or any smooth riemannian manifold in general ) .",
    "that is , @xmath135 for a submanifold @xmath0 with co - dimension 2 , while @xmath136 if @xmath0 is of co - dimension 1 .",
    "indeed , the form @xmath137 for smooth closed curves in @xmath59 and surfaces in @xmath1 was first derived in @xcite and now is widely used in the level set method .",
