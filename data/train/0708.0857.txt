    "we will first show how clumping affects doublet ratios and then use a time series to demonstrate the presence of clumping in winds .",
    "it is well known in the agn community that doublet ratios are sensitive to clumping , with the ratio related to the covering factor of the clumped medium ( e.g. , ganguly et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for an extended source ,",
    "the optical depth ratio determined from a doublet lies between the ratio of the blue and red @xmath0-values ( @xmath6 ) and unity , depending on the covering factor of the source .",
    "further , it is possible to interpret the observed doublet ratio within the framework of the oskinova et al .",
    "( @xcite ) model . in their model ,",
    "the doublet components have an _ observed _ optical depth ratio of @xmath7 which varies between 1 and @xmath8 ( see , massa et al .",
    "2003 , for a definition of @xmath9 , and oskinova et al . for definitions of the other symbols ) . consequently",
    ", if we allow the ratio of @xmath0-values to be a free parameter , @xmath10 thus , @xmath11 ( determined by the fit ) gives @xmath12 and , hence @xmath13 .",
    "oskinova et al .",
    "also relate the measured and smoothed opacities ( or optical depths ) and the clump optical depths as follows : @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the mass loss rate and @xmath17 is the ionization fraction , see , e.g. , massa et al .",
    "@xcite ) should be derived from @xmath18 , the observed @xmath15 must be corrected as follows @xmath19 fig .",
    "[ massa : functions ] shows how the `` observed ratio '' defines a point on the y - axis which gives @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath13 then gives the ratio of the effective to actual opacity , @xmath20 .",

    "points are data , dashed curve is sei fit with fixed @xmath0-values , solid curve allowed the ratio of @xmath0-values to vary.[massa : zet_pup ] ]    it must now be determined whether this additional information is present in the observed profiles . as a first test , we fit the si  iv@xmath271400 doublet in the sample of b supergiants given in prinja et al .",
    "( @xcite ) using a variable @xmath0-value .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ massa : bsupers ] .",
    "notice that all of the @xmath0-value ratios lie between 1 and 2 , as expected for a clumped wind .    as a second test",
    ", we fit @xmath28  data of the p  v@xmath29 doublet in @xmath1  pup .",
    "two least squares sei ( lamers et al .",
    "@xcite ) fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ massa : zet_pup ] .",
    "both use a @xmath30kk , @xmath31 tlusty model photosphere",
    ". the dashed fit uses the actual ratio of @xmath0-values , 2.02 .",
    "the solid fit varied the ratio , giving a best fit value of 1.84 .",
    "this 10% change clearly improves the fit , making the blue absorption weaker relative to the red .",
    "the fit gives @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the correction to @xmath15  is only 1.3 , increasing ratio of p  v to radio mass loss rates given by fullerton et al .",
    "( @xcite ) from 0.11 to 0.14  _ still far smaller than expected _ , even if @xmath34p  v@xmath35 . thus the mass loss rate in this case is truly smaller than expected .     in hd 47240 .",

    "consequently , each of its si  iv components are effectively independent .",
    "thus , they were fit independently .",
    "the result is equivalent to allowing @xmath40 to be a function of velocity .",

    "[ massa : dynamic ] , which shows the observed and modeled normalized dynamic spectra versus spectrum number for each component , and fig .  [",

    "several points are noteworthy .",
    "first , _ both _ components show similar , persistent velocity dependent structure .",
    "the fits of many b supergiants given by prinja et al .",
    "( @xcite ) had similar structure appearing in different ions in the same star .",
    "thus , this structure may be real . whether it results from density inhomogeneties or velocity plateaus , can not be determined .",
    "second , when @xmath9  is greater than a few tenths and well - defined , the ratio of optical depths varies between 1 ( clumped ) and 0.5 ( unclumped ) .",
    "third , it appears that the ratio ( clumping ) decreases at velocities where the density decreases .",
    "fourth , there seems to be a general decrease in the clumping at larger velocity , similar that seen in o stars by puls et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that resonance doublets contain more information than is usually exploited , that this information is related to clumping , and that it can be interpreted by the oskinova et al .",
    "( @xcite ) model .",
    "our ultimate goal is to apply these techniques to a large number of stars with a range of stellar and wind parameters .",
    "this will allow us to examine how these relate to the empirically determined clumping parameters and provide clues to the physical agents responsible for wind clumping .",
