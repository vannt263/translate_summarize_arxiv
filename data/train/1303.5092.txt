    "quantum plasmonics is a rapidly emerging field that offers new opportunities for investigating quantum optics at the nanoscale  @xcite . here , novel capabilities in the way the electromagnetic field can be localised  @xcite and manipulated  @xcite open up the prospect of miniaturisation , scalability and strong coherent coupling with single - emitter systems  @xcite , beyond the limits of conventional photonic systems  @xcite . in particular , with the advancement of nanofabrication and characterisation technologies ,",
    "metal nanoparticles have been attracting considerable attention as they allow a flexible approach to reaching a high confinement of optical fields  @xcite , and it has recently been suggested to use them for building compact on - chip quantum plasmonic networks operating at the nanoscale  @xcite . however , ohmic loss in the metals that support plasmonic excitations is a major obstacle for realising plasmonic quantum information processing and quantum control  @xcite .",
    "this energy dissipation process induces decoherence in the system and limits the performance of a given task .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the optimal distance for quantum state transfer in an array of nanoparticles is severely limited  @xcite . in order to overcome the problem of loss in plasmonic systems researchers",
    "have begun to consider employing various types of gain media  @xcite or metamaterials  @xcite , while trying to keep the high field confinement characteristic offered by plasmonic systems .",
    "a different approach has been to tailor the system dynamics such that the steady state of the system yields useful states , the so - called driven - dissipative approach  @xcite . despite this important progress in techniques to overcome loss in plasmonic systems , implementing quantum information processing based on an array of metal nanoparticles remains elusive .    in this paper , as a first step towards building quantum plasmonic networks based on metal nanoparticles , we propose an alternative and practical scheme for generating entanglement , between two distant quantum dots ( qds ) , using the plasmonic modes of a metal nanoparticle array .",
    "we show that one can achieve entangled qd states with high fidelities even in the presence of large losses from the metal nanoparticles and inhomogeneous broadenings of the qds .",
    "robustness against metal loss of the entanglement ( or equivalently against an increase in the length of the nanoparticle array ) alleviates the length limit of the array , opening up its use for compact nanoscale quantum networks including quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum communication  @xcite , and quantum repeaters  @xcite .",
    "the plasmonic scenario also provides opportunities in the construction of quantum plasmonic devices on scales far below the diffraction limit , a more compact approach than traditional optical cavities or ion trap networks .",
    "the robustness of the entanglement against detunings of the qds allows the scheme to work even when the qds have different resonant frequencies , where the operating frequency to be detected is far off - resonant with the qd transitions .",
    "this is an important practical consideration .",
    "it ultimately stems from the fact that only classical sources of light are required to generate the entanglement between two distant qds .",
    "the scheme we introduce is based on a quantum interference phenomena introduced by waks and vukovi  @xcite called dipole - induced transparency ( dit ) .",
    "we utilise this interference effect to construct our entangled states and analyse in detail the impact of dissipation and detection efficiency on its stability .",
    "while previous studies have investigated entanglement of quantum dots using dit  @xcite , our analysis of loss in this study goes well beyond that of previous works and allows us to realistically apply dit to a quantum plasmonic scenario .",
    "this provides a more compact setting for the generation of entanglement compared to other approaches , such as photonic crystal cavities , which are an order of magnitude larger in size .",
    "the physical system for the entanglement generation scheme consists of an array of spherical nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric material , with two distant qds and four tapered metal nanowires , as depicted in a top - down view in figure  [ setup ]  ( a ) .",
    "all metallic regions have a frequency - dependent permittivity @xmath0 , and the background dielectric region has a static real and positive permittivity @xmath1 .",
    "the tapered metal nanowires are connected to adjacent metal nanoparticles and serve as input / output ports .",
    "the nanoparticle structure can be decomposed into two arms , each consisting of a linear array of nanoparticles , as considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which meet in the centre at a special arrangement of four nanoparticles that serves as a plasmonic beam splitter , as discussed in ref .",
    "each arm of nanoparticles supports electron - charge density oscillations in the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the array orientation . for the orientation of the source",
    "nanotips shown in figure  [ setup ]  ( a ) , due to the direction in which the electron charge density oscillates in the nanowires , the nanowire field couples predominantly to the longitudinal oscillation in the nanoparticle .",
    "for coupling to the transverse polarisation , we rotate each source nanotip clockwise or counterclockwise by 90@xmath2 .",
    "each polarisation direction is maintained through the beam splitter whose corners are bent by 90@xmath2 due to near field nature of the coupling with negligible radiation losses into the far field , provided that only nearest - neighbour interactions are considered  @xcite .",
    "thus , a longitudinal ( transverse ) mode from the sources will become a transverse ( longitudinal ) mode at the drains , and subsequently the drain nanotips should be properly oriented to collect charge - density oscillations in the corresponding direction as shown in figure  [ setup ]  ( a ) .",
    "alternatively , the out - of - plane transverse mode ( perpendicular to the plane ) can be used even if the corners at the nanoparticle beam splitter or the junction between the beam splitter and the two arms have arbitrary bending angles .",
    "the coupling strength between the nanoparticles depends on their separation distance and the direction of the electron - charge density oscillations @xcite .",
    "each qd is coupled to the first metal nanoparticle of its respective array ( as shown in figure  [ setup ]  ( a ) ) , and assumed to have three internal energy states : a ground state , a long - lived metastable state , and an excited state , which we refer to as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , as shown in figure  [ setup ]  ( b ) .",
    "the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the qubit states of the qd . the transition between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is assumed to be optically coupled to the adjacent nanoparticle , while the optical transitions connected to @xmath9 are decoupled due to spectral detuning .",

    "-th nanoparticle ( as shown in panel ( c ) ) .",
    "a detection event at drain 2 ( or alternatively on - chip detection linking to the @xmath10-th nanoparticle ) can also lead to entanglement generation between the qds .",

    "( b ) energy level diagram for the qds .",
    "each qd ( @xmath11 ) has three states @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 and has a @xmath5-@xmath4 ( @xmath6-@xmath4 ) transition with frequency @xmath15 , which is detuned by @xmath16 from the natural frequency of the adjacent nanoparticle , @xmath17.,width=472 ]      if we take a single arm , say the left - hand side of figure  [ setup ]  ( a ) , then depending on the state of the qd , both the transmission and reflection coefficients of the metal nanoparticle array exhibit different characteristics .",
    "when the qd is in the state @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ when it is decoupled from the adjacent nanoparticle due to the large detuning ( see [ dir].1 ) , the characteristics of the transmission and reflection coefficients of the source nanowire reveal a similar behaviour to those of a single array of nanoparticles ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where the plasmonic field is transmitted across the array when it is on - resonance with one of the eigenmodes . on the other hand , when the qd is in the state @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ when it is coupled to the adjacent nanoparticle , the propagating plasmons can not pass through the adjacent nanoparticle and are completely reflected back into the source nanowire due to a phenomenon called _ dipole induced reflection _ ( dir ) , which is an alternative form of _ dipole induced transparency _ ( dit )  @xcite . here",
    ", dir occurs when the operating frequency @xmath18 of the plasmons is resonant with the @xmath5-@xmath4 transition frequency ( as shown in [ dir].1 ) .",
    "the entanglement generation scheme then works as follows : consider that light in the form of plasmon excitations are injected into the system via both of the source nanowires at the same time and that the qds are prepared in a superposition , @xmath19 . if a plasmon is detected coming out from drain 1 for given input states at the sources , for example coherent states , then the plasmon came from the cases where either one of qds is in @xmath6 , or both are in @xmath6 .",
    "a destructive interference of the case @xmath20 can be induced by controlling the phases of the initial coherent states , so that only states @xmath21 and @xmath22 lead to the detection event and consequently a superposed state of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is generated after the detection , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath24 , which is an entangled state of the qds .",
    "likewise , the detection of a plasmon coming from drain 2 can be also used for generating the entangled state @xmath25 .",
    "this requires different phases of the initial states compared to the case of the detection at drain 1 , similar to the case of a bulk beamsplitter which has the transformation @xmath26 so the output port is controlled by the input phases . here",
    ", we focus on the case of the detection at drain 1 .",
    "this is the basic concept for generating entanglement between two qds using the plasmonic modes of a metal nanoparticle array in the ideal case when there is no loss .",

    "the interaction term in equation  ( [ hnp ] ) involves two approximations for the center - to - center distance , @xmath42 , between nanoparticles : a _ point - dipole _ approximation ( @xmath43 ) , where multipolar interactions are negligible  @xcite , and a _ near - field _",

    "one of the advantages of the scheme is the use of coherent states as initial ` seed ' states for the generation of entanglement .",
    "these enable the scheme to be stable no matter how much loss the initial coherent fields experience on input to the array system . on the other hand the second type of loss , the outcoupling loss , more significantly affects the fidelity and the efficiency .",

    "in this work we have described an entanglement generation scheme between two qds using the plasmonic modes of a metal nanoparticle array . here , we have taken a particular nanoparticle structure consisting of two metal nanoparticle arrays which meet at a beam splitter of nanoparticles .",
    "although ohmic loss ( energy dissipation ) in metals generally induces damping in the supported plasmonic systems and limits the use of plasmonics for quantum control and state engineering , we have shown a scheme for entanglement generation that provides a robust performance against metal loss and the length of the nanoparticle arrays .",
    "such robustness overcomes the length limit of nanoparticle arrays for use in nanoscale photonic quantum networks , thus opening up further possibilities for constructing quantum plasmonic devices on scales far below the diffraction limit .",

    ", we demonstrated that the robustness of the scheme originates from the characteristics of the transmission and reflection amplitudes of the system .",
    "the robustness against loss comes about as the fidelity mostly depends on the behaviour of the reflection coefficient of each arm and the reflection is less sensitive with nanoparticle losses since the energy never enters the array .",

    "while here we have concentrated on treating the main source of imperfection , that is metal loss , further works geared toward an experimental demonstration could include fabrication issues such as disorder in the resonance frequency of the nanoparticles and their coupling due to the non - ideal shape of realistic nanoparticles and the aperiodic arrangement of the array @xcite .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath342 . however , as in dit",
    ", we do not need the full normal mode splitting condition @xmath343 , known as the high - q cavity regime .",
    "we can achieve a large purcell factor when @xmath344 even for much smaller values of @xmath283 .",
    "this is known as the low - q cavity regime , where the coupling strength @xmath283 between the nanoparticle and the dipole is less than the nanoparticle decay rate @xmath334 .",
    "when the nanoparticle plasmonic excitations and the @xmath5-@xmath4 transition of the dipole are in tune ( @xmath328 ) , the overall spectrum of the reflection amplitude is always symmetric with respect to @xmath208 , at which the local maximum is located , as shown in figure [ subsetup ]  ( b ) . here",
    ", the dipole dissipation rate has a stronger effect on the reflection ( transmission ) of an on - resonance excitation than the nanoparticle dissipation rate does . when @xmath345 , a plasmon is still completely reflected , even with the presence of the nanoparticle loss @xmath334 , whereas when @xmath346 , the dissipation of the dipole interrupts the quantum interference , so that the nanoparticle is marginally excited for a plasmon at @xmath347 and the loss via the nanoparticle increases .",
    "two minima ( maxima ) in the reflection ( transmission ) spectrum are located at @xmath348 , in the limit of a large purcell factor @xmath349 , which corresponds to the rabi - split frequencies @xmath350 .",
    "we find that the linewidth of the broadest transmission peak is the nanoparticle linewidth whereas the linewidth of the narrow dip corresponds to the linewidth of the dipole dressed by the nanoparticle excitation .",
    "this quantum interference that produces the narrow reflection window with a simultaneously strong dispersion results in a significant enhancement of the group delay and the possibility of a slowdown or ` storage ' of light , as in electromagnetic induced transparency  @xcite .",
    "consider the case where the dipole is not resonant with the nanoparticle , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath352 . when the dipole transition frequency @xmath282 is detuned slightly away from the nanoparticle frequency @xmath17 , the spectrum of the reflection and transmission amplitudes become asymmetric , which is known as a fano resonance , as discussed by shen and fan  @xcite .",
    "the local maximum ( minimum ) in the reflection ( transmission ) spectrum is located at @xmath353 in the limit of a large purcell factor @xmath349 , regardless of the detuning between the dipole and the nanoparticle , as shown by the solid lines of figure [ subsetup ]  ( b ) and ( c ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the dipole is very far detuned from the nanoparticle resonance frequency , the dipole is essentially decoupled from the nanoparticle field , so that the reflection ( transmission ) properties are determined by the nanoparticle only , and the reflection ( transmission ) spectrum dips down to zero at the nanoparticle frequency @xmath118 , as shown by the dashed lines in figure  [ subsetup ]  ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "this feature could be exploited to achieve a fast single - excitation switch : for an incoming photon with frequency @xmath118 , the transmission is @xmath57 when the dipole is in tune with the nanoparticle ( @xmath354 ) , while the transmission is essentially @xmath355 when the dipole is far - detuned .",
    "thus by tuning the transition frequency of the dipole , the single - plasmon transport can be regulated and the setup acts as a single - plasmon ( or photon in the far field ) switch , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "if the dipole is decoupled from its adjacent nanoparticle ( solid lines ) , their behaviour as @xmath213 is varied becomes different ; the transmission ( reflection ) has a maximum ( minimum ) value at @xmath357 for @xmath140 , whereas the transmission ( reflection ) rises ( drops ) quickly as @xmath213 is increased for @xmath142 .",
    "furthermore the transmission and reflection are quite sensitive to @xmath214 changing . on the other hand ,",
    "if the dipole with a detuning of @xmath299 is coupled to its adjacent nanoparticle ( dashed lines ) , dir can be observed when @xmath358 for both @xmath140 and @xmath142 .",
    "furthermore , the transmission and reflection are no longer sensitive to @xmath214 changing ; the transmission is nearly zero regardless of @xmath213 , and the reflection only slightly drops from 1 as @xmath213 increases due to the decay of the dipole , @xmath285 . as the number of nanoparticles is increased further , similar trends to those of increasing the metal loss are seen , since the effects of increasing @xmath126 are equivalent to increasing @xmath214 for a fixed number of nanoparticles , as discussed in the main text.,width=491 ]    , as the nanoparticle detuning frequency @xmath256 and input - output coupling @xmath213 are varied for arrays of @xmath359 , and @xmath360 nanoparticles . regardless of the parity of the nanoparticle number , the early increase of @xmath213 enables the off - resonant transfer from the source nanowire to the first nanoparticle , whereas its late increase leads to strong coupling as if the first nanoparticle becomes the extended ` tip ' of the nanowire .",
    "thus the large",
    "@xmath213 implies that the number of nanoparticles is effectively reduced to @xmath361 . here",
    ", dir occurs at @xmath208 , when the dipole detuning is given by @xmath299 , and the transmission becomes nearly zero regardless of @xmath213 and the number of nanoparticles.,width=529 ]      we now increase the number of nanoparticles in the array , while keeping the dipole coupled to the first nanoparticle , as shown in figure  [ subsetup ] . as in the case of @xmath301",
    ", we have transmission , reflection , and absorption amplitudes from the scattering matrix given in equation  ( [ sm ] ) .",
    "if the dipole is decoupled from nanoparticle , the transmission and the reflection amplitudes follow the characteristic of a metal nanoparticle array studied in ref  @xcite , which have different dependencies on @xmath155 .",
    "we classify their behaviour into two groups : even and odd numbers of nanoparticles in the array . as a representative of even and odd numbers of nanoparticles , we consider the case of @xmath140 and @xmath142 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , for an odd number of nanoparticles , there is always a resonance at the natural frequency @xmath17 , whereas for an even number of nanoparticles , a resonance property at the natural frequency @xmath17 depends on the magnitude of @xmath213 .",
    "thus , the transmission properties as @xmath213 is varied at @xmath208 are different for @xmath140 and @xmath142 when the dipole is decoupled from nanoparticle , as shown in figure  [ trginout ]  ( a ) and ( b ) . here , the transmission ( reflection ) has a maximum ( minimum ) value at @xmath357 for @xmath140 , whereas the transmission ( reflection ) rises ( drops ) quickly as @xmath213 is increased for @xmath142 . in addition , in figure  [ trginout ] we show the dependence of the transmission and reflection with varying amount of metal loss for @xmath140 and @xmath142 . the dependence on the metal loss is more sensitive for the transmission than for the reflection , regardless of the parity of the number of nanoparticles , which is the main reason for the robustness against the metal loss mentioned in the main text .",
    "as the metal loss is increased , the transmissions become lower ; for @xmath140 ( or any even number ) they still have a maximum near @xmath362 , which is reflected in the efficiency as shown in figure  [ fidelity loss ] ( c ) of the main text .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath142 ( or any odd number ) the transmissions are still flat as @xmath213 is increased , which is also reflected in the efficiency , as shown in figure [ fidelity loss ] ( d ) of the main text .",
    "the reflection amplitudes shown in  [ trginout ]  ( c ) and ( d ) are highly related to the transition amplitude @xmath363 shown in figure  [ coefficient loss ]  ( a ) and ( b ) , enabling the scheme to be robust to the metal loss .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the nanoparticle is coupled to the dipole whose detuning is zero , @xmath299 , dir can be observed at @xmath208 for @xmath140 and @xmath142 when @xmath358 . in figure",
    "[ trginout ] , while the transmission is nearly zero ( dashed lines in ( a ) and ( b ) ) , the reflection ( dashed lines in ( c ) and ( d ) ) is nearly one and decreased only slightly with @xmath213 , which is related to the coefficient @xmath364 in figure  [ coefficient loss ]  ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in addition , when dir occurs , both the transmission and reflection amplitudes are largely insensitive to nanoparticle losses , as expected from the case of @xmath301 . in figure",
    "[ tginoutomega ] , the spectral profile of the transmission is presented as @xmath256 and @xmath213 are varied for @xmath365 and @xmath360 , in the presence of metal loss @xmath152 , as in ref .",
    "note that on resonance ( @xmath137 ) dir can be observed regardless of @xmath213 and the number of nanoparticles , where the transmission becomes nearly zero for @xmath258 , with the dipole detuning given as @xmath299 .",
    "here , we investigate the effects of the pulse width of the coherent field injected into the source nanowires .",
    "we start by focusing on the coherent field that comes from the source nanowire on the left - hand side , whose multi - mode coherent state can be described by @xmath366 , where the wavepacket operators are @xmath367 , with @xmath368  @xcite . for concreteness , we consider a gaussian wave packet with spectral amplitude profile @xmath369 , where @xmath17 is the central frequency and @xmath370 is the standard deviation corresponding to a full width at half maximum bandwidth @xmath371 for the spectral intensity profile @xmath372 .    such a coherent field pulse should be carefully employed with appropriate constraints for the analysis of this work to be valid .",
    "first , for the monochromatic approximation ( @xmath208 ) to be valid , @xmath371 should be narrow enough such that as the entanglement generation scheme is carried out , each amplitude of the system hardly changes ( or varies slowly ) .",
    "this is equivalent to non - dispersive transfer of the plasmons in the metal nanoparticle array  @xcite .",
    "second , the higher - order photon number contributions that induce decoherence impose a constraint of @xmath373 for a high - fidelity entangled state to be generated between the qds .",
    "third , the analysis of the protocol using dir is valid in the weak excitation regime where the qds are unsaturated , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath374 which is equivalent to @xmath375 .",
    "if the amplitude of the input coherent field is large enough such that the @xmath376-@xmath377 transitions of the qds are saturated , then they will lead to an optical nonlinearity and linewidth broadening  @xcite , and equation  ( [ sigma1 ] ) can no longer be treated in the linear regime . to investigate the implications of this weak excitation limit",
    ", we use the heisenberg equations of motion for the first nanoparticle and qd@xmath51 , and ignore the field operator for the second nanoparticle since it never has the chance to be excited when dir occurs . thus , equation  ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ sigma1 ] ) can be rewritten in the weak excitation regime as @xmath378 eliminating @xmath379 from the above equations when @xmath380 , we have at resonance ( @xmath381 ) , @xmath382 the above equation can be multiplied by its conjugate to give @xmath383 where @xmath384 , @xmath385 , and @xmath386 are assumed , and @xmath387 represents the probability of qd@xmath51 being in the excited state . here",
    ", @xmath388 is identified as the total flux of photons in the input field @xmath389 of frequency @xmath17 . in the weak excitation limit , @xmath390 , which finally puts a limit on the excitation number @xmath391 of @xmath392 where @xmath393 is the pulse width of @xmath394 .",
    "note that this third constraint of the weak field excitation approximation can also cover the first and second constraints of sufficiently narrow bandwidth @xmath371 ( or equivalently long pulse width @xmath393 ) and low excitation number @xmath395 .",
    "similar constraints on @xmath396 for @xmath397 can be derived from the heisenberg equations of motion for the @xmath10-th nanoparticle and qd@xmath56 .",
    "here , we explain the behaviours of fidelity and efficiency of section 4.1 in detail by analysing the final state @xmath183 given in equation  ( [ final state ] ) .",
    "first , let us consider the fidelity .",
    "for the case of resonant qds ( @xmath226 ) , we have the coherent amplitudes for drain 1 as @xmath206 , a condition required to generate a perfect singlet state , @xmath25 , as seen in the discussion of the ` limiting scenario ' in section 3",
    ". we also have the coherent amplitudes for drain 2 as @xmath398 , so that the corresponding term in equation  ( [ final state ] ) can be factored out from @xmath183 .",
    "on the other hand , the coherent amplitudes for the other output modes , corresponding to the sources , @xmath399 and @xmath400 , are not equal to each other and can not be factored out , which leads to dephasing of the qd state .",
    "in addition , all of the bath modes ( modelling loss at the nanoparticles ) are also involved in dephasing the qd state in a similar way .",
    "these bath modes dominate the value of the fidelity for large values of @xmath214 as @xmath401 . nevertheless , the dephasing effects of the bath modes and their impact on the fidelity are relatively weak compared to the source modes until large losses are incurred in the system , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath402 . for these reasons ,",
    "both the coherent amplitudes for the source output modes , @xmath403 and @xmath404 , are predominantly responsible for the behaviour of the fidelity before @xmath214 becomes very large .",
    "thus , we focus on investigating the behaviour of the amplitudes @xmath403 and @xmath404 . due to the beam splitter , the transition amplitudes @xmath405 and @xmath406 , so that @xmath407 and @xmath408 , where @xmath363 is the reflection coefficient when dir occurs for qd@xmath158 , while @xmath364 is related to the reflection coefficient of a single arm in the absence of qd@xmath158",
    ". thus , the more similar @xmath364 and @xmath363 are to each other , the more similar @xmath403 and @xmath404 are to each other , and the output states in the corresponding modes can be factored out from the state @xmath183 in equation  ( [ final state ] ) .",
    "this leads to a high fidelity .",
    "otherwise , the more @xmath364 and @xmath363 are dissimilar to each other , the more they cause dephasing .     and @xmath409 are shown . in ( c ) and ( d ) the density matrix entry @xmath410 is shown .",
    "in all plots @xmath213 is varied for set amounts of metal loss : @xmath411 , and @xmath57.,width=491 ]    to compare @xmath403 and @xmath404 , we choose as an example @xmath227 in figure  [ coefficient loss ] , and show the dependence of @xmath363 and @xmath364 on the input / output coupling @xmath213 for a set of values of metal loss . in figure  [ coefficient loss ]  ( a ) and ( b ) , the coefficient @xmath363 ( dashed line ) , which is related to the occurrence of dir , does not change appreciably with respect to the increase in loss .",
    "this is because the first nanoparticle is not excited due to quantum interference when dir occurs ( see  [ dir].2 ) , similar to a waveguide coupled to a cavity with a dipole  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the coefficient related to the absence of a qd , @xmath364 , exhibits the characteristics of a nanoparticle array , where the dependence on @xmath213 is different for even and odd numbers of nanoparticles , as seen in  [ dir].2 . for @xmath140 ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath364 diverges from @xmath363 as @xmath213 increases and reveals a slight variation in @xmath214 , which explains the falling fidelity as @xmath213 increases and robustness of the fidelity with increasing @xmath214 , as shown in figure [ fidelity loss ] ( a ) . for @xmath142 , the coefficient @xmath364 also diverges from @xmath363 as @xmath213 increases , which again explains the fidelity decay as @xmath213 increases in figure  [ fidelity loss ]  ( b ) .",
    "however , contrary to the case of @xmath140 , the coefficient @xmath364 moves closer to @xmath363 as @xmath214 increases when @xmath213 is small , and shows a bigger variation compared to the @xmath140 case when @xmath213 is increased , as shown in figure  [ coefficient loss ]  ( b ) .",
    "this analysis explains the slight increase in fidelity with @xmath214 for small @xmath213 , and the robust fidelity with @xmath214 for large @xmath213 that is shown in figure  [ fidelity loss ]  ( b ) . while @xmath403 and @xmath404 are approximately responsible for the fidelity when @xmath226 , the entry @xmath410 in the qd density matrix is the only entry that directly determines the fidelity among the different entries of @xmath193 , since @xmath412 when @xmath226 . in figure  [ coefficient loss ]  ( c ) and ( d ) , we plot @xmath410 . by comparing the behaviour of @xmath410 in these plots with that of the fidelity in figure  [ fidelity loss ]  ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", it can be seen that as the real part of @xmath410 goes to @xmath413 , the fidelity increases .",
    "thus , the behaviour of @xmath410 follows the trend of @xmath364 with increasing @xmath214 and @xmath213 , except for the intermediate regime of @xmath213 . here , there is an interplay of other field modes in the system , which become significant and make a small difference in the trend of @xmath410 compared to that of the source coherent amplitudes @xmath403 and @xmath404 .",
    "secondly , let us consider the efficiency .",
    "in contrast to the fidelity , the efficiency depends only on the amplitudes @xmath414 , @xmath415 , @xmath416 , and @xmath417 , as seen in equation ( [ efficiency ] ) , which are mostly related to the transmission amplitudes of the two arms . in appendix  [ dir].2 ,",
    "the square of the transmission amplitudes are presented in figure  [ trginout ] , where for @xmath140 the transmission is found to have its highest value at @xmath357 , whereas for @xmath142 the transmission quickly increases with increasing @xmath213 .",
    "such characteristics of the nanoparticle array are reflected in the efficiencies for both @xmath140 and @xmath142 , as shown in figure  [ fidelity loss ]  ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "higher values of the transmission as @xmath213 is varied enable the probability of the injected plasmons to exit via drain nanowires to become more likely , so that the efficiency to detect excitations at drain 1 increases ( compare figure  [ fidelity loss ]  ( c ) and ( d ) with figure  [ trginout ]  ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this shows that the efficiency does not have simple trade - off with the fidelity in figure  [ fidelity loss ] .",
    "in line a of figure  [ detunings ] , imperfect dirs at both ends of the array occurs due to the qd detunings .",
    "the asymmetric detuning leads to @xmath418 , so that @xmath419 and there exists a non - zero probability of detection at drain 1 when both the qds are in @xmath5",
    ". thus , the state @xmath93 gives a detection , causing a loss of fidelity .",
    "furthermore , in line a we have @xmath420 .",
    "this is not a problem if the respective imaginary terms are approximately zero .",
    "however , if this is not the case then it leads to dephasing in the final qd state . here , the phase difference between @xmath416 and @xmath417 affects the relative phase @xmath421 of the generated entangled qd state as @xmath422 . from this point - of - view",
    ", @xmath423 is highly desirable for achieving a high - fidelity , as pointed out in the limiting scenario in section 3 .",
    "thus , increasing @xmath250 causes a loss of fidelity since the respective imaginary terms of @xmath416 and @xmath417 are increased , as can be seen in figure [ detunings ]  ( d ) .    in line b of figure  [ detunings ] , the equal detunings of the qds enables @xmath424 to be obtained via destructive interference with the help of the matching condition , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath425 .",
    "it also enables @xmath423 to be obtained , which provides a high fidelity , in contrast to line a. here , increasing @xmath249 disturbs the dirs at both ends of the array , so that the amplitudes related to the occurrence of dir are no longer much different from the amplitudes that follow the characteristics of the system in the absence of the qds .",
    "thus , all the other field modes for @xmath91 are approximately equal to those for @xmath92 and can be factored out so that @xmath426 .",
    "in addition , the magnitudes of @xmath416 and @xmath417 decrease with increasing @xmath249 such that @xmath183 moves closer to the state @xmath427 obtained in the limiting scenario of weak coherent states . as a result",
    ", the fidelities increase with increasing @xmath249 for both @xmath140 and @xmath142 , as shown in figure  [ detunings ]  ( e ) .",

    "<S> we introduce a scheme for generating entanglement between two quantum dots using a plasmonic waveguide made from an array of metal nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the scheme is robust to loss , enabling it to work over long distance plasmonic nanoparticle arrays , as well as in the presence of other imperfections such as the detuning of the energy levels of the quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme represents an alternative strategy to the previously introduced dissipative driven schemes for generating entanglement in plasmonic systems . here </S>",
    "<S> , the entanglement is generated by using dipole - induced interference effects and detection - based postselection . </S>",
    "<S> thus , contrary to the widely held view that loss is major problem for quantum plasmonic systems , we provide a robust - to - loss entanglement generation scheme that could be used as a versatile building block for quantum state engineering and control at the nanoscale . </S>"
