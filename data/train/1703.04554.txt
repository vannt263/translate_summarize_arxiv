    "the role of heterogeneity in populations and their mobility have long been recognized as driving forces in the spread of infectious diseases @xcite . indeed , populations are composed of individuals with different immunological features and hence differ in how they can transmit or acquire an infection at a given time .",
    "these differences could result from demographic , host genetic or socio - economic factors @xcite .",
    "populations also move across different geographical landscapes , importing their disease history with them either by infecting or getting infected in the host / visiting location . +",
    "while the concept of modeling epidemiological heterogeneity within a population goes back to kermack and mckendrick in modeling the age of infection @xcite , the approach gained prominence with yorke and lajmonivich s seminal paper @xcite on the spread of gonorrhea , a sexually transmitted disease .",
    "an abundant and varied literature have followed on understanding the effects of  superspreaders \" which are core groups on the disease dynamics @xcite or related multi - group models @xcite ( and the references therein ) .",
    "similarly , spatial heterogeneity in epidemiology has been extensively explored in different settings .",
    "continuum models of dispersal have been investigated through diffusion equations @xcite whereas _ islands _ models have been dealt through metapopulation approach @xcite , defined here as continuous models with discrete dispersal .",
    "+ although the importance and the complete or partial analysis of these two types of heterogeneities have been studied separately in the aforementioned papers , little attention has been given to the simultaneous consideration of groups and spacial heterogeneities . moreover , previous studies on multi - group rely on differential susceptibility in each group through the waifw ( who acquires infection from whom @xcite ) matrices which , we argue , are difficult to quantify . similarly , in metapopulation settings , the movement of individuals between patches is captured in terms of flux of population , making it nearly impossible to track the life - history of individuals after the interpatch mixing .",
    "+ in this paper , we introduce a general modeling framework that structures populations into an arbitrary number of groups ( e.g. demographic , ethnic or socio - economic grouping ) .",
    "these populations , with different health statuses , spend certain amounts of time in an arbitrary number of locations , or _",
    "patches _ , where they could get infected or infect others .",
    "each patch is defined by a particular risk of infection tied to environmental conditions of each patch .",
    "this approach allows us to track individuals of each group over time and to avoid the use of differential susceptibility of individuals or groups , which is theoretically nice but practically difficult to assess .",
    "the likelihood of infection depends both on the time one spends ( in a particular patch ) and the risk associated with that patch .",
    "moreover , we incorporate individuals behavioral decisions through differential residence times .",
    "indeed , individuals of the same group spend different amounts of time in different areas depending on their epidemiological conditions .",
    "we also considered two cases of the general framework , that are particularly important from modeling standpoint : when the susceptible and/or infected individuals of different groups have proportional residence times in different patches .",
    "that is , when the mobility matrix of susceptible ( or infected ) individuals , @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) is of rank one . in these cases ,",
    "we obtain explicit expressions of the basic reproduction number in terms of mobility patterns .",
    "it turns out that if @xmath1 is of rank one , the basic reproduction number is independent of the mobility patterns of susceptible host .",
    "+ in short , we address how group heterogeneity , or _ groupness _ , patch heterogeneity , or _ patchiness _ , mobility patterns and behavior each alter or mitigate disease dynamics . in this sense ,",
    "our paper is a direct extension of @xcite but also other studies that capture dispersal through lagrangian approaches @xcite and a recent paper @xcite that investigates the effects of daily movements in the context of dengue . + the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we consider a population that is structured in an arbitrarliy many @xmath4 groups interacting in @xmath5 patches .",
    "we consider a typical disease captured by an seirs structure .",
    "naturally , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the susceptible , latent , infectious and recovered individuals of group @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the population of each group is denoted by @xmath11 , for @xmath12 .",
    "individuals of group @xmath10 spend on average some time in patch @xmath13 , @xmath14 . the susceptible , latent , infected and recovered populations of group @xmath10 spend @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 proportion of times respectively in patch @xmath13 , for @xmath14 . at time @xmath19 , the _ effective _ population of patch @xmath13 is @xmath20 .",
    "this _ effective _ population of patch @xmath13 describes the temporal dynamics of the population in patch @xmath13 weighted by the mobility patterns of each group and each epidemiological status .",
    "of this patch population , @xmath21 are infectious .",
    "the proportion of infectious individuals in patch @xmath13 is therefore ,    @xmath22    susceptible individuals of group @xmath10 could be infected in any patch @xmath13 , @xmath14 while visiting there .",
    "hence , the dynamics of susceptible of group @xmath10 is given by :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 denotes a constant recruitment of susceptible individuals of group @xmath10 , @xmath25 the natural death rate , @xmath26 the risk of infection and @xmath27 the immunity loss rate .",
    "the patch specific risk vector @xmath28 is treated as constant .",
    "however , in subsection [ ddtransmission ] , we also considered the case when this risk depends on the _ effective population size_.    the latent individuals of group @xmath10 are generated through infection of susceptible and decreased by natural death and by becoming infectious at the rate @xmath29 .",
    "hence the dynamics of latent of group @xmath10 , for @xmath12 , is given by :    @xmath30    the dynamics of infectious individuals of group @xmath10 is given by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the recovery rate of infectious individuals .",
    "finally , the dynamics of recovered individuals of group @xmath10 is :    @xmath33    the complete dynamics of @xmath4-groups and @xmath5-patches seirs epidemic model is given by the following system : @xmath34 \\dot e_i=\\sum_{j=1}^v\\beta_jm_{ij}s_i\\dfrac{\\sum_{k=1}^up_{kj}i_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^u(m_{kj}s_k+n_{kj}e_k+p_{kj}i_k+q_{kj}r_k)}-(\\nu_i+\\mu_i)e_i\\\\ \\dot i_i=\\nu_ie_i-(\\gamma_i+\\mu_i+\\delta_i)i_i\\\\ \\dot r_i=\\gamma_ii_i-(\\eta_i+\\mu_i)r_i \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] the description of parameters in model ( [ patchgen ] ) is given in table [ tab : param ] .",
    "these parameters are composed of three set of parameters : ecological / environmental ( number of patches @xmath5 and their risk @xmath35 ) , epidemiological ( recruitment , death rates , recovery rate , etc ) and behavioral ( mobility matrices ) parameters . a schematic description of the flow is given in fig [ fig : flowenv ] .",

    "the structure of the host population is different and independent from the patches where the infection takes place .",
    "indeed , in the previous epidemic models describing human dispersal or mixing ( eulerian or lagrangian ) , hosts structure unit and the geographical landscape unit , be it group or patch , is the same and homogeneous in term of _ transmission rate_. our model captures added heterogeneity in the sense that we decouple the structure of the host to that of patches . for instance , our framework fits well for nosocomial diseases ( hospital - acquired infections ) , where the hospitals could be treated as patches and host s groups as gender or age ( see @xcite for the effects of gender and age on nosocomial infections ) .",
    "2 .   in our formulation , there is no need to measure contacts rates , a difficult task for nearly all diseases that are not either sexually transmitted or vector - borne . each patch is defined by its specific risk of infection that could be tied to environmental or hygienic conditions . hence , susceptibility is not individual - based nor group - based as in classical formulation of multi - group models ( the contact matrices in these type of models are known as waifw , i.e. , who acquires infection from whom @xcite ) , but a patch specific risk .",
    "the risk in each patch may be fixed , as in model ( [ patchgenmatrix ] ) , or variable and dependent of the _ effective _ patch population ( see subsection [ ddtransmission ] ) .",
    "the prospect of infection is tied to the environmental risk and time spend in that environment .",
    "this fits , for example , pandemic influenza in schools and , again , the nosocomial infections ( length of stay in hospitals and their corresponding risks ) .",
    "these residences times and patch related risks are easier to quantify than _ contact rates_. this paper extend earlier results in @xcite .",
    "3 .   the model allows individuals of different groups to move across patches without losing their identities .",
    "this approach allows a more targeted control strategy for public health benefit .",
    "therefore , the model follows a lagrangian approach and generalize @xcite .",
    "4 .   there are different mobility patterns depending on the epidemiological class of individuals .",
    "this allows us to highlight and assess the effects of hosts behavior through social distancing and their predilection for specific patches on the disease dynamics .",
    "although the differential mobility have been considered in an eulerian setting @xcite , its incorporation in a lagrangian setting is new and is an extension of @xcite ( for which mobility is independent of hosts epidemiological class ) .",
    "5 .   in this framework",
    ", we consider only patches where the infection takes place ( hospitals , schools , malls , etc ) whereas previous models suppose that the patches are distributed over the whole space .",
    "in short , the mobility matrices are not assumed to be stochastic .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 the vector of populations of each group .",
    "the dynamics of the population in each group is given by the following :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 denotes the hadamar product .",
    "thus , the set defined by @xmath54 is a compact attracting positively invariant for system ( [ patchgenmatrix ] ) .",
    "+ the disease - free equilibrium ( dfe ) of system ( [ patchgenmatrix ] ) is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 .    if the susceptible or infected individuals are restricted to go to the patches where the infection takes place , either through government intervention strategy or social distancing , that is when the residence time matrices @xmath1 or @xmath2 are the null matrix ( the susceptible individuals do spend any time in the considered patches ) , the disease doe not spread and eventually dies out .",
    "we compute the basic reproduction number following @xcite . by decomposing the infected compartments of ( [ patchgenmatrix ] ) as a sum of new infection terms and transition terms ,    @xmath57    the jacobian matrix at the dfe of @xmath58 and @xmath59",

    "in this section , we investigate the effects of _ patchiness _ , _ groupness _ and mobility on the basic reproduction number .",
    "more particularly , how the basic reproduction number changes its monotonicity with respect to the number of patches , groups and mobility patterns of individuals . + the following theorem gives the monotonicity of the basic reproduction with respect the residence times patterns of the infected individuals .",

    "the following result gives the global stability of the dfe .",
    "its proof is similar to that of theorem [ globaldfesamerestimes ] .",
    "whenever the host - patch mobility configuration @xmath107 is irreducible , the following statements hold :    1 .   if @xmath219 , the dfe is globally asymptotically stable .",
    "2 .   if @xmath220 , the dfe is unstable .",
    "the proof of the existence and uniqueness of the endemic equilibrium ( ee ) for model ( [ patchgenmatrixbil ] ) is done in two steps , by carefully crafting a new auxiliary system whose ee uniqueness is tied to that of model ( [ patchgenmatrixbil ] ) .",

    "we obtain :    [ eq : xy ]    @xmath241    where @xmath242 it follows from ( [ eq : xyb ] ) that @xmath243 , and hence ( [ eq : xya ] ) implies that @xmath244 where @xmath245    after some algebraic manipulations , it could be shown that @xmath246 .",
    "combining the fact that @xmath244 and ( [ eq : xyb ] ) , it follows that ( [ eq : xy ] ) , and subsequently ( [ equilibriumrelations ] ) , could be written in the single vectorial equation :    @xmath247 where @xmath248 thus , model ( [ patchgenmatrixbil ] ) has a unique endemic equilibrium @xmath230 if and only if @xmath249 has a unique fixed point @xmath250 .",
    "the desired result is achieved .",
    "next , we present another lemma whose proof is straightforward :    [ gfrelationship ] the function @xmath249 has a fixed point @xmath251 if and only if @xmath251 is an equilibrium of @xmath252 where @xmath253    the proof of this lemma is straightforward .",
    "[ uniquenesseebil ]    under the assumption that the host - patch mobility configuration @xmath107 is irreducible , model ( [ patchgenmatrixbil ] ) has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever @xmath220 .    by using lemma [ gee ] and lemma [ gfrelationship ] ,",
    "the uniqueness of ee for model ( [ patchgenmatrixbil ] ) is equivalent to the uniqueness of an ee for this system @xmath254 when @xmath220 .",
    "therefore , we will prove that the auxiliary system ( [ auxsys ] ) has an unique ee .",
    "in fact , we will prove that this equilibrium is globally attractive if @xmath220 .",
    "the proof of the latter is based on hirsch s theorem @xcite , by using elements of monotone systems .",
    "the jacobian of the vector field @xmath255 is : @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the identity matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath258 is a diagonal matrix and @xmath259 is a nonnegative matrix ( since @xmath260 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath261 is metzler and is irreducible since @xmath262 is .",

    "since @xmath266 , we deduce that @xmath267 has at least a positive eigenvalue and therefore @xmath268 is unstable .",
    "therefore , system ( [ auxsys ] ) has unique equilibrium @xmath269 , which is globally attractive , due to hirsch s theorem @xcite ( theorem 6.1 ) .",
    "we conclude that model ( [ patchgenmatrixbil ] ) has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever @xmath270",
    ".    note that with the choice of @xmath271 and @xmath272 , system ( [ patchgenmatrixbil ] ) is exactly system ( [ patchgenmatrixsamerestimes ] ) .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic behavior of their solutions are isomorphic .",
    "heterogeneity in space and social groups are often studied separately and sometimes interchangeably in the context of disease dynamics . moreover , in these settings , susceptibility of the infection is based on group or individual . in this paper , we propose a new framework that incorporates heterogeneity in space and in group for which the structure of the latter is independent from that of the former .",
    "we define patch as a location where the infection takes place , which has a particular risk of infection .",
    "this risk is tied to environmental or hygienic or economic conditions that favors the infection .",
    "the likelihood of infection in each patch depends on both the risk of the patch and the proportion of time each host spend in that environment .",
    "we argue that this patch - specific risk is easier to assess compared to the classical differential susceptibility or waifw matrices .",
    "human host is structured in groups , where a _ group _ is defined as a collection of individuals with similar demographic , genetic or social characteristics . in this framework , the population of each patch at time @xmath19 is captured by the temporal mobility patterns of all host groups visiting the patches , which in turn depends on the host s epidemiological status .",
    "+ under this framework , we propose a general seirs multi - patch and multi - group model with differential state - host mobility patterns .",
    "we compute the basic reproduction number , @xmath0 , which depends on the mobility matrices of susceptible , @xmath1 , and infected , @xmath2 .",
    "the disease persists when @xmath162 and dies out from all patches when @xmath163 ( fig .",

    "when this matrix is not irreducible , the disease will persist or die out in all patches of the subsystem for which the configuration group - patch is irreducible and will be decoupled from the remaining system .",
    "+ we systematically investigate the effects of heterogeneity in mobility patterns , groups and patches on the basic reproduction and on disease prevalence .",
    "indeed , we have shown that , if the epidemiological parameters are fixed , the basic reproduction number is an increasing function of the entries of infected hosts movement matrix ( e.g. theorem [ theoreminegar0p ] ) .",
    "also , if the number of groups is fixed , an increase in the number of patches increases the basic reproduction number ( e.g. see theorem [ r0bounds ] ) .",
    "explicit expressions of the basic reproduction numbers are obtained when the mobility matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 are of rank one . that is , when , for all groups , susceptible ( and infected ) individuals residence times in all patches are proportional ( theorems [ mrank1 ] and [ prank1 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that if the susceptible residence time matrix is of rank one , the basic reproduction number is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "however , if the infected residence time matrix @xmath2 is of rank one , the basic reproduction number still depends on the infected movement patterns .",
    "+ the patch - specific risk vector @xmath35 could also depend on the effective population size .",
    "we explored the case when this dependence is linear , that is when , for each patch @xmath13 , @xmath273 . in this case , the transmission term of our model is captured by a density dependent incidence .",
    "moreover , we show that this case is isomorphic to the general model , where the mobility patterns of host does not dependent on the epidemiological class , that is when @xmath274 .",
    "we prove that , in this case the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable whenever @xmath275 while an unique endemic equilibrium exists if @xmath162 .",
