    "in recent years , large multi - wavelength photometric surveys conducted with the @xmath17 and @xmath0 @xmath18 @xmath19 have enabled us to study the properties of galaxies over cosmic time .",
    "synthetic stellar population modeling of broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) has led to the determination of various physical properties ( e.g. , stellar mass , star formation rate , age , dust extinction ) of these galaxies ( ; ; ; ; , ; finkelstein et al .",
    "2012 ; ; ; ) . of all derived quantities , stellar masses are particularly robust in stellar population fits .",
    "small changes in the age of the stellar populations , metallicity or other parameters have no significant effect on the estimated masses ( e.g. , ; ) .",
    "considerable progress has been made in refining current characterization of galaxies from the observations .",
    "even so , the measurements of the specific star formation rate ( ssfr , the star formation rate divided by the stellar mass ) have presented a puzzle to the theoretical understanding of the build - up of mass in galaxies .",
    "( e.g. , ; ) .",
    "several past studies had indicated that the ssfr of sources with fixed stellar mass shows no evidence for significant evolution between @xmath1 @xmath20 2 and @xmath1 @xmath20 7 ( ; ) .",
    "this result was in apparent disagreement with semi - analytic models predicting a strong increase in the specific inflow rate ( i.e. inflow rate divided by halo mass ) of baryons with redshift ( ) .",
    "subsequent work has strongly suggested that the ssfr of galaxies is somewhat higher at @xmath10 than it is at @xmath14 ( e.g. , schaerer & de barros 2010 ; stark et al .  2013 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2014 ; salmon et al .  2015 ) .",
    "the change in the inferred ssfr evolution with cosmic time was the result of improved observational constraints and a more sophisticated treatment of those constraints .",
    "one example of this is in a consideration of dust extinction in computing the ssfrs at @xmath10 .",
    "while it was not possible to properly account for the impact of dust extinction in initial work ( e.g. , ) due to large uncertainties on the @xmath21 colors of @xmath10 galaxies , later work ( ( ) was able to make use of new measurements of the @xmath21 continuum slopes to account for the impact of dust extinction , finding @xmath22 larger ssfrs at @xmath23 .",
    "this suggested a @xmath24 evolution relative to the @xmath14 value ( ) , but still leaving the ssfr at @xmath1 @xmath25 4 approximately constant .",
    "even more important has been the increasing awareness of the impact of rest - frame optical nebular emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath5 , [ oiii ] , [ oii ] ) on the broadband fluxes ( e.g. , , , ) . at high redshifts these emission lines",
    "are shifted into the infrared , contaminating the irac measurements of the stellar continuum .",
    "inferred stellar masses from fitting of stellar population models will then be overestimated , resulting in an underestimate of the ssfr .",
    "since these strong rest - frame optical lines are inaccessible to spectroscopy beyond @xmath14 - 3 , the strength of the nebular emission lines has been estimated from the contamination of the @xmath0/irac 3.6@xmath4 m and 4.5@xmath4 m bands for galaxies at @xmath1 @xmath25 3 .",
    "( ) show that galaxies in the range 3.8 @xmath15 @xmath1 @xmath15 5.0 are considerably brighter at 3.6 @xmath4 m than expected from the stellar continuum alone and argue that this excess is due to strong h@xmath5 line emission .",

    "the results indicate a possible trend towards higher h@xmath5 ews at higher redshifts , which is extremely important for estimating the ssfr at @xmath1 @xmath25 5 ( see also ; ; ; ) .",
    "independent evidence for high - ew nebular lines having a large impact on the broadband fluxes of @xmath26 galaxies was obtained from early near - infrared , multi - object spectroscopic campaigns ( e.g. , ; ) .",
    "the highest - redshift window providing us a largely clean measurement of the h@xmath5 ew is the redshift range @xmath27 - 5.40 . here",
    "the flux excess due to the redshifted nebular emission lines gives rise to significantly redder [ 3.6 ] @xmath3 [ 4.5 ] colors over this range , making it possible to quantify the ew of h@xmath5 at @xmath28 in a similar way to that possible in the redshift range @xmath29 to 5.0 . by examining the [ 3.6 ] @xmath3 [ 4.5 ] color of galaxies from the ( ) catalog ( see  3.1 ) over the great observatories",

    "we can derive approximate constraints on the h@xmath5 flux and ew at the highest redshift currently accessible at reasonable s / n with current facilities .",
