    "the ongoing experiments at the @xmath2 factories allow measurements of @xmath2 decays and @xmath3 violation with greatly improved precision ( see e.g. @xcite ) which should be matched also on the theoretical side .",
    "the most difficult obstacle are the long - distance qcd effects playing an important , sometimes even dominant role in weak decays of hadrons .",
    "one of the most powerful tools in applying qcd to hadron physics is the method of qcd sum rules . since its invention in 1979 @xcite ,",
    "the sum rule method has become more and more advanced not only technically , but also conceptually .",
    "a prominent example is provided by the sum rule for the semileptonic @xmath0 transition , relevant for the determination of the ckm - matrix element @xmath4 . in the following ,",
    "we discuss this transition together with the analogous @xmath1 transition in more detail .",
    "measurements of the latter can serve as valuable cross checks for the qcd sum rule method .",
    "the non - perturbative dynamics of the above heavy - to - light transitions is encoded in two form factors @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameterizing the hadronic transition matrix elements .",
    "focussing on @xmath7 , one has | |b _ q | b & = & 2 f^+ q_+ ( f^+ + f^- ) p _ , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the momenta of the pion and the lepton pair , respectively . for the light electron and muon channels",
    "only the form factor @xmath5 is relevant , whereas in the tau channel also @xmath6 plays a role .",
    "sometimes , it is convenient to use the scalar form factor @xmath10 given by [ scalarff ] f^0 & = & f^+ + f^- .    in early qcd sum rule calculations of heavy - to - light form factors",
    "short - distance operator product expansion was applied to suitable three - point correlation functions , following the original ideas of shifman , vainshtein and zakharov .",
    "however , this approach suffers from soft end - point contributions .",
    "a significant improvement was achieved by using instead two - point correlation functions such as f_(p , q ) & = & idx e^ipx ( q)|t\\{|u(x)_b(x ) , m_b|b(0)i_5 d(0)}|0 where the time - ordered product of operators is sandwiched between the vacuum and a physical pion state .",
    "expansion of the operator product near the light - cone @xmath11 then leads to a sum over hard scattering amplitudes convoluted with pion distribution amplitudes of twist 2,3,4,etc .",
    ". currently these series are truncated after twist 4 .",
    "the resulting sum rules are usually called light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) .    for the @xmath12 transition the lcsr allows to calculate @xmath5 and @xmath10 in the range of momentum transfers @xmath13 .",
    "beyond this limit the light - cone expansion breaks down , while the kinematically allowed momentum range extends up to @xmath14 . for predictions at large momentum transfer ,",
    "one may rely on phenomenological assumptions or models like vector meson dominance . according to this particular model the form factor @xmath5 should exhibit a single pole behaviour : f^+(p^2 ) & = & , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 being the mass , decay constant and coupling of the vector ground state , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the strong coupling @xmath18 can also be calculated from a lcsr based on the same correlation function ( 3 ) , but using a double dispersion relation .",
    "however , for @xmath12 transitions the single pole model can not be expected to provide a sufficiently accurate and complete description @xcite .",
    "although several improvements have been implemented , a solution which is free of additional assumptions has still been missing . in section",
    "i , we discuss a new approach @xcite which is designed to cover the whole kinematical range of momentum transfer .    in the past years ,",
    "the lcsr have further been refined by including qcd corrections to the leading twist 2 contributions @xcite . as the most recent example @xcite",
    ", the qcd corrections to the scalar form factor @xmath10 will be presented in section ii .",
    "we note in passing that t. huang , z.h .",
    "li and x.y .",
    "wu @xcite have suggested to employ a chiral correlation function , in order to reduce the numerical impact of higher twist contributions .",
    "very recently , a. khodjamirian @xcite extended the lcsr technique to the nonleptonic decay @xmath19 . finally ,",
    "also the various updates of the pion wave functions @xcite should be mentioned here .",
    "in this section we review a new method suggested in @xcite for calculating heavy - to - light form factors .",
    "the method is an extension of lcsr and is based on first principles .",
    "the main idea is to use a combination of double and single dispersion relations .",
    "we rewrite the usual correlation function as f_(p , q ) & = & f(p^2,(p+q)^2 ) q_+ ( p^2,(p+q)^2 ) p _ , and focus on the invariant amplitude @xmath20 . in the following ,",
    "we use the definitions ( p^2,s_2 ) = _",
    "s_2 f(p^2,s_2 ) , ( s_1,s_2 ) = _ s_1 _ s_2",
    "f(s_1,s_2 ) .",
    "the standard sum rule for the form factor @xmath21 is obtained by writing a single dispersion relation for @xmath20 in the @xmath22-channel , inserting the hadronic representation for @xmath23 and borelizing in @xmath22 : [ eqa1 ] b_(p+q)^2 f & = & b_(p+q)^2 ( + _ s_2>s_0 ds_2 ) .",
    "note that any subtraction terms which might appear vanish after borelization .",
    "similarly , the standard light - cone sum rule for the coupling @xmath18 is obtained from a double dispersion relation : [ eqa2 ] b_p^2 b_(p+q)^2 f & = & b_p^2 b_(p+q)^2 ( .",
    "+ & & . + _ ds_1 ds_2 ) , where @xmath24 denotes the integration region defined by @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast to the above procedure we suggest to use a dispersion relation for @xmath29 in the @xmath30-channel ( with @xmath31 being an integer ) : [ eqa3 ] ( p^2,s_2 ) & = & - ( p^2)^l . |_s_1=0 + _ s_1>m_b^2 ds_1 , and to replace @xmath23 in ( [ eqa1 ] ) by the r.h.s of ( [ eqa3 ] ) .",
    "large enough the dispersion relation ( [ eqa3 ] ) will be convergent .",
    "] then , writing a double dispersion relation for @xmath32 and comparing it with the previous result , we obtain the sum rule [ eqa6 ] f^+(p^2 ) & = & - ( p^2 ) ^l . |_s_1=0 + & & + _  ds_1 ds_2 e^- , where the integration region @xmath33 is defined by @xmath25 and @xmath34 . this sum rule is valid in the whole kinematical range of @xmath30 . as input",
    "we need the first @xmath35 terms of the taylor expansion of @xmath21 around @xmath36 .",
    "these parameters can be obtained numerically from the standard sum rule for @xmath21 : [ eqa1a ] f^+(p^2 ) & = & _ m_b^2^s_0 ^qcd(p^2,s _ 2 ) e^- following from ( [ eqa1 ] ) .",
    "we further need the residue at the pole @xmath37 , which can be obtained from the sum rule ( [ eqa2 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the parameter @xmath31 plays a similar role as the borel parameter @xmath38 .",
    "there is a lower limit on @xmath31 such that the dispersion relation ( [ eqa3 ] ) converges .",
    "going to higher values of @xmath31 will improve the convergence of the dispersion relations and will suppress higher resonances in the @xmath39-channel .",
    "but there is also an upper limit on @xmath31 .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath31 , the more derivatives of @xmath21 at @xmath36 enter . at some point ,",
    "one starts probing the region @xmath40 , where the standard sum rule ( [ eqa1a ] ) breaks down .",
    "details on the numerical analysis of the new sum rule can be found in @xcite .",
    "our results are summarized in the convenient parameterization@xcite [ paramb ] f_b^+(p^2)=  , with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 in remarkable agreement with @xmath43 derived in @xcite",
    "[ fp1 ] shows a comparison of ( [ paramb ] ) with recent lattice results @xcite .",
    "the agreement within uncertainties is very satisfactory .",
    "finally , the lcsr prediction also obeys the constraints derived from sum rules for the inclusive semileptonic decay width in the heavy quark limit @xcite .",
    "this is also demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fp1 ] .",
    "the above results on @xmath44 can be used to calculate the width of the semileptonic decay @xmath45 with @xmath46 . for the integrated width , one obtains@xcite = dp^2 ( e_^2-m_^2)^3/2 ^ 2 = ( 7.3 2.5 )  |v_ub|^2  ^-1  . [ elmu ] experimentally , combining the branching ratio @xmath47 with the @xmath48 lifetime @xmath49 ps one gets @xmath50 from that and ( [ elmu ] ) one can then determine the quark mixing parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the result is |v_ub|=(4.0 0.7 0.7)10 ^ -3 [ result ] with the experimental error and theoretical uncertainty given in this order . using the result analogous to ( [ paramb ] ) for the @xmath1 transition one obtains @xcite @xmath52 and @xmath53 which nicely agrees with lattice estimates , for example , the world average @xcite @xmath54 or the most recent ape result @xcite , @xmath55 . for more details one should consult@xcite",
    "the form factor @xmath56 is usually defined through the matrix element @xmath57 and related to the form factors @xmath5 and @xmath6 as shown in ( [ scalarff ] ) . in order to determine @xmath10 from sum rules it is advantageous to consider @xmath5 and @xmath58 . the sum rule for @xmath5 has been discussed in the previous section , the sum rule for @xmath58 is schematically given by [ sumrule ] f^+(p^2 ) + f^-(p^2 ) & = & - _ m_b^2^s_0ds _ 0 ^ 1 du ( - ) + & & _ ( u ) t_qcd(p^2,s , u , ) . in the above , only the leading twist 2 contribution is shown , @xmath59 being the corresponding hard scattering amplitude , @xmath60 the pion distribution amplitude , and @xmath61 the borel mass parameter .",
    "the complete expressions of @xmath59 in lo and nlo can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",

    "[ fzero ] ( left ) , the resulting form factor @xmath64 is plotted together with the ukqcd lattice results @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that the radiative effects improve the agreement between the lattice and the lcsr calculations . also shown in fig .",
