    "since the last decades compounds with lanthanide or actinide elements as heavy - fermion systems have attracted great interest because of their interesting experimental behavior .",
    "numerous strange phases are thought to be possible as the ground state of such a system , ordered and disordered phases as well . as a theoretical background the periodic anderson model ( pam )",
    "is one of the most important applicants to explain the physics in these systems .",
    "however , despite its relatively simple structure up to now the complete exact solution of the model is not known even in one dimension and there are mostly approximative results . in 1993 , using a method proposed by brandt and giesekus @xcite , strack @xcite found the exact ground state in @xmath1 for the strong coupling @xmath2 case .",
    "his results were generalized for @xmath3 dimensions by orlik and gulcsi @xcite also in @xmath2 .",
    "this strong coupling limit is however an extremal case and is important to look for results in the physical domain where @xmath4 . here",
    "we present for the first time exact results for pam at finite @xmath5 , in @xmath1 dimension .",
    "two different solutions are reported , one insulating and a metallic one , both at 3/4 filling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the following section is devoted to introduce the model and to show the positive decomposed form of the hamiltonian used in the remaining part of the paper .",
    "section iii . contains the results of the calculations , and finally section iv . concludes the results and closes the paper",
    "to start our study we use the hamiltonian ( @xmath6 ) of pam as presented below :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 $ ] with @xmath9 are hoppings for @xmath10 and @xmath11 electrons , + @xmath12 $ ] is the on - site and @xmath13 $ ] is the first - neighbor hybridization term , @xmath14 is the hubbard on - site interaction , and @xmath15 are the particle - number operators .",
    "+ to have a form of @xmath6 appropriate for our goal let us transform eq.([hamiltonian ] ) to the following form :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are given by the following equations : @xmath20 in order to solve eqs.([xyzveqs ] ) let us introduce @xmath21 .",
    "using @xmath22 , from eqs.([xyzveqs ] ) we have @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the square of @xmath25 is determined by @xmath26 . during the calculation we used the conditions @xmath27 going on with transforming @xmath6 we get from eq.([h1 ] ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lattice size , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "after this step , from eq.([h2 ] ) in the case of @xmath33 , the final form of @xmath6 is given by @xmath34 this form of @xmath6 consists of constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 , positive semidefinite operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and @xmath39 which is related to the particle number as @xmath40 . because @xmath37 and @xmath38 are positive semidefinite , omitting them the ground state of the operator built up of the remaining terms must be a lower bound to the ground - state energy : @xmath41 an upper limit @xmath42 for the ground state energy @xmath43 can be derived from the variational principle , assuming some wave function @xmath44 to be the ground state .",
    "if there is any domain in the space of the model parameters with @xmath45 then on that domain the exact ground state is @xmath44 and the exact ground state energy is @xmath43 .",
    "this procedure will be followed in the next section .",
    "in this section we describe two different and exact ground - state solutions for pam at finite @xmath46 related to an insulating and a metallic phase .",
    "we start the presentation with the insulating case .",
    "consider that all the coupling constants are real .",

    "we have @xmath51 .",
    "we also need the conditions @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , that are counterparts of those given in eq.([conditions ] ) but for the case of real coupling constants . in these conditions",
    "we have a lower limit for the ground state energy from eq.([lowerbound ] ) and eq.([xyzv1 ] ) , in the case of @xmath55 : @xmath56 \\ : l.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to get also an upper bound we call the variational principle .",

    "collecting all the conditions we used : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 the ground state is given by eq.([psi1 ] ) and the ground state energy is of the form of eq.([lowerlimit1 ] ) .",
    "+ to get a deeper insight into the nature of the state represented by @xmath61 we show some expectation values calculated with it . since @xmath61 sets three electrons on each site it is obvious that any way of moving an electron from a certain site @xmath70 to an other @xmath71 results an orthogonal state to it so we have @xmath72 expectation values of other terms after normalization are given as @xmath73 it is known that in the case of large @xmath46 the periodic anderson model goes to the kondo lattice model which has an interesting insulating ground state at half - filling called the kondo - insulator . as can be seen , pam in strong coupling limit is able to give an insulating phase not only at half - filling , but also at 3/4 filling as presented here . from eq.([otherterms1 ] ) we see that @xmath61 contains all the possible spin directions ( i.e. is degenerate in spin ) and thus describes an insulating paramagnetic state with zero net magnetic moment .",
