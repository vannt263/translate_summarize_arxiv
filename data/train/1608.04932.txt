    "this paper deals with phase transition models ( pt models for short ) of hyperbolic conservation laws for traffic .",
    "more precisely , we focus on models that describe vehicular traffic along a unidirectional one - lane road , which has neither entrances nor exits and where overtaking is not allowed .    in the specialized literature ,",
    "vehicular traffic is shown to behave differently depending on whether it is free or congested .",
    "this leads to consider two different regimes corresponding to a _ free - flow phase _ denoted by @xmath0 and a _ congested phase _ denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the pt models analyzed here are given by a scalar conservation law in the free - flow phase , coupled with a @xmath2 system of conservation laws in the congested phase .",
    "the coupling is achieved via _ phase transitions _",
    ", namely discontinuities that separate two states belonging to different phases and that satisfy the rankine - hugoniot conditions .",
    "this two - phase approach was introduced by colombo in @xcite and is motivated by experimental observations , according to which for low densities the flow of vehicles is free and approximable by a one - dimensional flux function , while at high densities the flow is congested and covers a @xmath3-dimensional domain in the fundamental diagram , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 1.1 ) .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to describe the dynamics in the free regime by a first order model and those in the congested regime by a second order model .",
    "colombo proposed to let the free - flow phase @xmath0 be governed by the classical lwr model by lighthill , whitham and richards @xcite , which expresses the conservation of the number of vehicles and assumes that the velocity is a function of the density alone ; on the other hand , the congested phase @xmath1 includes one more equation for the conservation of a linearized momentum .",
    "furthermore , his model uses a greenshields ( strictly parabolic ) flux function in the free - flow regime and one consequence is that @xmath0 can not intersect @xmath1 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2 ) .",
    "the two - phase approach was then exploited by other authors in subsequent papers , see @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite goatin couples the lwr equation for the free - flow phase @xmath0 with the arz model formulated by aw , rascle and zhang @xcite for the congested phase @xmath1 . in the author",
    "s intentions such a model has the advantage of correcting the drawbacks of the lwr and arz models taken separately . recall that this pt model has been recently generalized in @xcite .",
    "another variant of the pt model of colombo is obtained in @xcite , where the authors take an arbitrary flux function in @xmath1 and consider this phase as an extension of lwr that accounts for heterogeneous driving behaviours .    in this paper",
    "we further generalize the two pt models treated in @xcite and @xcite . for more clarity",
    ", we refer to the first model as the pt@xmath4 model and to the latter as the pt@xmath5 model .",
    "we omit these superscripts only when they are not necessary .",
    "we point out that in @xcite the authors assume that @xmath6 , while in @xcite the authors assume that @xmath7 . here",
    "we do not impose any assumption on the intersection of the two phases for both the pt@xmath4 and the pt@xmath5 models .",
    "moreover , in order to avoid the loss of well - posedness of the riemann problems in the case @xmath7 as noted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2 ) , we assume that the free phase @xmath0 is characterized by a unique value of the velocity , that coincides with the maximal one .    in the next sections , we study riemann problems coupled with a local point constraint on the flow . more precisely , we analyze in detail two constrained riemann solvers corresponding to the cases @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we recall that a local point constraint on the flow is a condition requiring that the flow of the solution at the interface @xmath10 does not exceed a given constant quantity @xmath11 .",
    "this can model , for example , the presence at @xmath10 of a toll gate with capacity @xmath11 .",
    "we briefly summarize the literature on conservation laws with point constraint recalling that :    * the lwr model with a local point constraint is studied analytically in @xcite and numerically in @xcite ; * the lwr model with a non - local point constraint is studied analytically in @xcite and numerically in @xcite ; * the arz model with a local point constraint is studied analytically in @xcite and numerically in @xcite ; * the pt model @xcite with a local point constraint is analytically studied in @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the model presented in @xcite is so far the only pt model with point constraint .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ptmodels ] we introduce the pt@xmath4 and pt@xmath5 models by giving a unified description valid in both cases . in particular",
    ", we list the basic notations and the main assumptions needed throughout the paper and we give a general definition of admissible solutions to a riemann problem for a pt model . in sections  [ sec :",
    "inter ] and [ sec : noninter ] we outline the costrained riemann solver in the case of intersecting phases and non - intersecting phases , respectively . section  [ sec : tv ] contains some total variation estimates that may be useful to compare the difficulty of applying the two solvers in a wave - front tracking scheme ; see @xcite and the references therein . in section  [ sec : simu01 ] we apply the pt@xmath12 model to compute an explicit example reproducing the effects of a toll gate on the traffic along a one - lane road .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : tech ] we collect all the proofs of the properties previously stated .",
    "in this section , we introduce the pt models , collect some useful notations and recall the main assumptions on the parameters already discussed in @xcite .",
