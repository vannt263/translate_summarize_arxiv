    "50 exposures were eliminated at the beginning of each observation in order to insure a better stabilization of the detector , which shows remanence of its previous illumination history .",
    "20 2.1s exposures were added for each raster position .",

    "the new transient correction described by coulais & abergel ( @xcite ) has been applied , yielding considerable improvements with respect to the previous method implemented in the cia software . in particular , the photometric accuracy of our maps is now believed to be of the order of 10 % .",
    "corrections for field distortion have been applied to images at each position before combining them in a raster .",
    "the final raster images are of excellent cosmetic quality .",

    "the slope of the relation is similar within the fairly large errors ( at least 30 % ) to that for the galactic cirruses as derived from a combination of the results obtained by boulanger et al .",

    "the correlation between the mid  ir emission and h@xmath1 is very poor and there is almost no correlation with the far  uv radiation .",
    "there are however mid  ir peaks associated with   regions as depicted by h@xmath1 . in our galaxy , the emission at 58 @xmath2 m ( the wavelength range of the lw2 filter ) is strong in photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) at the interfaces between   regions and molecular clouds ( m17 : cesarsky et al .",
    "@xcite ; orion bar : cesarsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) and at the surfaces of molecular clouds illuminated by uv radiation ( reflection nebulae like ngc 7023 : cesarsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) . there is also emission from the more diffuse interstellar gas ( see e.g. abergel et al .",
    "however we do not know well the relative importance of these various sources at the scale of a galaxy .",
    "our observation of m31 gives a clear information on this point .",
    "the presence of peaks associated with   regions probably indicates mid  ir emission from interfaces , but there is some ambiguity here because there is also much ism close to the   regions . in any case , the mid  ir emission of the interfaces can not be a large fraction of the total , since there is much diffuse mid ",
    "ir emission in m31 far from h@xmath1 emission regions .",
    "we will see later ( fig .",
    "11 ) that only very few localized regions in m31 have a lw3/lw2 intensity ratio ( in jy ) larger than 1 , a characteristic of strong pdrs .",
    "particularly interesting is the vicinity of the main ob association of m31 , ngc206 = ob78 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the stellar winds and perhaps supernova explosions in this association have eroded a hole in the interstellar medium while triggering some secondary star formation in the resulting shell ( fig . 1 and 7 ) .",
    "the uv emission of the association itself is very strong ( fig . 3 and 8 ,",
    "see also hill et al .",
    "the lyman continuum photons from the ob stars of this association ( massey et al .",
    "@xcite and references herein ) ionize the inner shell as it can be seen clearly in h@xmath1 ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "still the mid  ir flux is not higher in this region than in inactive regions with similar column densities of gas .",
    "_ this confirms that the main factor which determines the mid  ir flux is the amount of gas , except in the immediate vicinity of regions where massive stars have just formed_. several such regions are well visible in the shell around ngc 206 ( fig .",
    "7 ) , each one with its own mid  ir peak .",
    "we conclude from these morphological considerations that in the ring of m31 the emission in the lw2 filter ( 5.08.0 @xmath2 m ) is dominated by the diffuse ism bathed in the general interstellar field .",
    "this confirms the result of the analysis of iras data from the solar neighbourhood by boulanger & prault ( @xcite ) .",
    "they showed that most of the interstellar infrared emission comes from ism not associated with current star formation .",
    "their result actually applies to the far  ir emission but since there is a good correlation between the emission in the 12 @xmath2 m iras filter and that in the filters at longer wavelengths it is likely to be true for the mid  ir emission as well .",
    "[ fig7 ]    [ fig8 ]",
    "the mid  ir band emission is generally considered to be excited by individual uv photons that transiently heat these particles to very high temperatures .",
    "however uchida et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found a `` normal '' galactic aib spectrum in the reflection nebula vdb133 , which is illuminated by a relatively cool binary star , and noticed that this poses a problem for the emission mechanism of the mid - ir bands .",
    "this is amply confirmed by our observations of m31 , as we will demonstrate now .",
    "[ fig9 ]    the correlation between the mid  ir and the far  uv emission in m31 ( fig .",
    "8) is apparently extremely poor .",
    "the lack of correlation must be due to some extent to the strong extinction in the gas and dust ring , given the large inclination of m31 on the line of sight .",
    "this extinction affects very much the uv radiation , but little the mid  ir .",
    "to get rid of the problem of extinction , we compare the ratios along the same 21cm line brightness isophote of 1000 k km s@xmath9 on each side of the 10 kpc ring ( see fig .",
    "4 , yellow boxes 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the column density of h atoms in h@xmath6 is estimated to be 4.5 10@xmath7 @xmath8 in box 1 and 3.8 10@xmath7 @xmath8 in box 2 compared to 1.8 10@xmath14 @xmath8 for . in the appendix",
    "we give estimates of the far ",
    "uv / visible interstellar intensity ratio per unit wavelength in various parts of m31 .",
    "we find i@xmath15(200 nm)/i@xmath15(550 nm ) @xmath16 on the outer side ( box 2 ) which is brighter in uv ( see fig . 8) and 0.05 on the inner side ( box 1 ) .",
    "this difference can not be due to extinction since the column densities of interstellar matter are the same for the two boxes .",
    "the intensity in the lw2 filter is almost the same for the two regions ( respectively 0.23 and 0.28 mjy / pixel plus a possible offset of about 0.3 mjy / pixel ) .",
    "this example shows beyond any doubt that the mid  ir intensity is almost independent of the uv radiation field in the observed region of m31 .",
    "this suggests that the aibs in m31 are in general not primarily excited by the far ",
    "uv photons .",
    "uv / visible interstellar intensity ratios on both sides of the ring of m31 are affected by the same amount of extinction and a model is required if one wishes to obtain dereddened ratios .",
    "this is done in the appendix where we show that the dereddened ratios are roughly 1.55 times larger than the observed ones .",
    "for comparison , i@xmath15(200 nm)/i@xmath15(550 nm ) @xmath17 in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "thus on both sides of the ring the i@xmath15(200 nm)/i@xmath15(550 nm ) ratio is smaller than near the sun , and it is clear that in this case the uv radiation has a negligible effect to excite the mid  ir emission . in the appendix , we also show that the uv / visible ratio in the reflection nebula vdb 133 observed by uchida et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is of the order of 0.4 , slightly smaller than in the solar neighbourhood but definitively larger than in quiescent regions of the ring of m31 .",
    "thus our observations of m31 yield an even more convincing case for the fact that excitation of the bearers of the aibs ( pahs ? ) does not require uv radiation .",
    "excitation might be by visible photons . in this case",
    "the emitters , if they are pahs , must be smaller than usually assumed since single  photon excitation by photons some 5 times less energetic than considered usually should bear them transiently to a temperature of several hundred degrees . alternatively , the aib excitation may be linked in some way to   given the excellent correlation between mid  ir and .",
    "a possibility could be that formation of h@xmath6 molecules by combination of h atoms on the aib carriers supplies their heating ( papoular @xcite ) .",
    "however it is easy to see that this mechanism fails by two orders of magnitude in the case of galactic pdrs and cirruses ( f. boulanger , private communication ) .",
    "this is probably also the case for m31 .",
    "there is however an underlying correlation between the mid - ir flux _ per h atom _ and the uv flux .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "9 , where we have plotted the intensity in the lw2 band normalized by the total column density of the neutral gas n(h ) as a function of the intensity at 200 nm .",
    "the intensity in the lw2 band has been corrected from the non  zero intercept seen on fig .",
    "6 by adding to it 0.3 mjy / pixel before dividing by n(h ) ( see sect .",
    "4 ) . from fig .",
    "9 we see that uv excitation becomes important only above an uncorrected surface brightness i@xmath18 @xmath5 2 10@xmath19 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 @xmath9 arcsec@xmath20 .",
    "the least ",
    "square regression line has a slope of 10@xmath11 mjy pixel@xmath9 @xmath8 per 10@xmath19 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 @xmath9 arcsec@xmath20 for i@xmath21 2 10@xmath19 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 @xmath9 arcsec@xmath20 , mostly determined by a few uv  bright regions .",
    "this would determine the amount of excitation due to the uv radiation if one could correct the uv flux for extinction , a very difficult task for uv - bright regions .",
    "in any case , the extinction correction is likely to decrease strongly the slope of the regression line .",
    "the weakness of the mid - ir / uv correlation has important consequences .",
    "it seems to imply that at low uv intensities uv excitation of the lw2 emitters is unimportant with respect to another excitation mechanism that remains to be determined .",
    "the dereddened uv surface brightness corresponding to the threshold for uv excitation is of the order of 10@xmath22 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 @xmath9 arcsec@xmath20 ( see appendix ) .",
    "it is easy from data in the appendix to calculate that the true ( unreddened ) uv surface brightness of the galactic disk near the sun , assumed to be seen from the same inclination of 77   as m31 , would be @xmath5 5 10@xmath19 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 @xmath9 arcsec@xmath20 at 200 nm .",
    "this is less than the above threshold and suggests that the mid - ir emission of the galactic cirruses is also only marginally excited by uv photons .",
    "this may explain why the ratio between the lw2 intensity and n(h ) is so similar in m31 and for galactic cirruses in spite of the difference in their uv fluxes . a uv radiation density 2 times larger than that near the sun appears to be needed for uv excitation to become appreciable in the disks of m31 and of the galaxy .",

    "10 the pixel  to  pixel correlation between the brightnesses in the two maps .",
    "a hanning smoothing has been applied to both the lw2 and the lw3 images in order to obtain similar angular resolutions at both wavelengths .",

    "the units are mjy / pixel for both intensities .",
    "the overall similarity between the lw3 , the lw2 map and the neutral gas indicates that the excitation mechanisms in the two wavelengths ranges must be related to each other and to the neutral ism .",

    "this illustrates the diversity of spectra found in the field , which go from `` normal '' aib spectra similar to those in our galaxy to spectra with a relatively strong , broad 11.3 @xmath2 m feature and very little emission in the 6.2 , 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath2 m bands .",

    "it is interesting to precise in this respect that the contribution of the 11.3 @xmath2 m feature to the emission in the iras 12 @xmath2 m filter ( 8.015.0 @xmath2 m ) is minor .",
    "the average iras brightness at 12 @xmath2 m in field c is @xmath5 0.7 mjy per 6   pixel from walterbos & schwering ( @xcite ) or xu & helou ( @xcite ) , of which at most 20 % comes from the 11.3 @xmath2 m band",

    "we conclude from this observation that the emission is globally dominated in m31 by the diffuse ism rather than by ism at the interfaces between   regions and neutral clouds . + * the mid  ir emission shows very little correlation with the far  uv radiation",
    ". this can not entirely be due to extinction of the far  uv in regions emitting in the mid  ir .",
    "the existence of regions with similar gas column densities hence similar extinctions and with identical mid  ir emissions but very different uv intensities shows that the aib carriers in m31 are not primarily excited by uv radiation except near star  formation centers .",
    "this confirms and extends the observation by uchida et al .",
    "( @xcite ) of a galactic reflection nebula with little uv showing a `` normal '' aib spectrum . in m31 like in this case ,",
    "the excitation of the aibs is dominated by something else than uv radiation , probably by photons in the visible .",
    "there is however some contribution of the uv to the excitation of the mid  ir emission that becomes apparent when the emission per h atom is plotted as a function of the uv flux ( fig .",
    "9 ) . in the disks of m31 and of the galaxy",
    "the uv excitation becomes important when the uv radiation density is of the order of 2 times that near the sun .",
    "this explains why the 5.08.0 @xmath2 m emission per h atom does not differ by more than 30 % in m31 and galactic cirruses in spite of the differences in the uv radiation density . + * the emission in the lw2 band ( 5.08.0 @xmath2 m ) is probably dominated by the aibs at 6.2 and 7.7 @xmath2 m , which whatever the emission mechanism are believed to be heated transiently by some quantum mechanism .",
    "the emission in the lw3 band ( 12.018.0 @xmath2 m ) is dominated by a continuum . in our galaxy , this continuum has often be attributed to emission by very small carbonaceous grains heated in semi - equilibrium by uv photons .",
    "the ratio between the intensities in these two bands i@xmath15(12.018.0 @xmath2m)/i@xmath15(5.08.0 @xmath2 m ) is very uniform over the observed part of m31 , of the order of 0.8 , except near star",

    "they are probably photodissociation interfaces . in these regions ,",
    "the radiation field is probably strong enough to heat the very small interstellar grains to temperatures such that they contribute strongly to the emission in the lw3 ( 12.018.0 @xmath2 m ) band . +",
    "* cesarsky et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have observed a strange mid  ir spectrum in four different regions of m31 .",
    "it is characterized by a strong , broad emission band at 11.3 @xmath2 m and faint bands at 6.2 , 7.2 and 8.6 @xmath2 m compared to galactic spectra .",
    "the present paper confirms this property and shows that the regions that exhibit this particular type of spectrum are only vaguely related with the regions emitting in the lw2 and the lw3 filters , and are not related with the presence or absence of uv radiation either .",
    "+    the present results have profound consequences on our knowledge of the mid  ir emission mechanisms in the interstellar medium .",
    "in particular , we found that the mid - ir emission of the galactic cirruses is not dominated by uv excitation , but probably rather by visible photons , or perhaps by another mechanism related to   that remains to be demonstrated .",
    "it is only in regions submitted to a substantially higher uv radiation field ( with respect to the visible radiation field ) that uv excitation becomes important .",
    "the @xmath23 ophiuchi cloud where the uv radiation density is about 10 times that in the solar neighborhood ( abergel et al .",
