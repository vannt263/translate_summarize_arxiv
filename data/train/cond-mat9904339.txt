    "x - ray photoemission spectroscopy pes is a useful tool for studying the electronic structure of solids .",
    "the theoretical description of pes is however very complicated@xcite and almost all work has been based on the so - called sudden approximation.@xcite the photoemission spectrum is then described by the electron spectral function convoluted by a loss function , describing the transport of the emitted electron to the surface .",
    "the sudden approximation becomes exact in the limit when the kinetic energy of the emitted electron becomes infinite.@xcite in this limit we can distinguish between intrinsic satellites , appearing in the electron spectral function , and extrinsic satellites , appearing in the loss function . for lower kinetic energy , this distinction",
    "is blurred due to interference effects , and the satellite weights are expected to be quite different as we approach the opposite limit , the adiabatic limit , of low kinetic energy.@xcite it is then interesting to ask at what kinetic energy the sudden approximation becomes accurate .",
    "this issue has been studied extensively for the case when the emitted electron couples to plasmons , and it has been found that the sudden approximation becomes valid only for very large ( @xmath14 kev ) kinetic energies.@xcite    a semi - classical approach has been found to work exceedingly well for the study of plasmon satellites.@xcite in such a picture , one may take the emitted electron to move as a classical particle away from the region where the hole was created .",
    "the system then sees the potential from both the created electron and hole .",
    "initially the electron potential cancels the hole potential , but as the electron moves away , the hole potential is gradually switched on .",
    "the switching - on of the hole potential may lead to the creation of excitations .",
    "if the kinetic energy of the electron is sufficiently large , we can consider the hole potential as being switched on instantly , and the creation of excitations around the hole then reaches a limiting value , the sudden limit . in the semi - classical picture ,",
    "the perturbation is turned on during a time @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the photoelectron velocity and @xmath17 is the range of the interaction ( scattering ) potential between the emitted electron and the excitations . in this picture",
    "we also need to determine the relevant time scale @xmath18 so that the sudden limit is reached if @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "our analysis within the semi - classical framework shows that @xmath21 is related to the energy @xmath22 of the relevant excitation of the system and to the strength @xmath23 of the scattering potential .",
    "we find a different characteristic energy scale @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a characteristic length scale of the scattering potential .",
    "on dimensional grounds one may argue that the adiabatic - sudden approximation takes place when the kinetic energy of the emitted electron is comparable to @xmath12 .",
    "this would differ dramatically from the semi - classical approach , where the transition takes place for energy of the order @xmath26 , i.e. e.g. , @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "alternatively , and again on dimensional grounds , one may argue that the sudden approximation becomes valid when the kinetic energy of the emitted electron is much larger than the energy @xmath5 of the relevant excitations of the system,@xcite in strong contrast to the two criteria above .",
    "this latter criterion is however not true in general.@xcite    for many systems with strong correlations , the core level spectrum can be understood in a charge transfer scenario.@xcite this is illustrated in fig . 1 for a cu compound , e.g. , a cu halide .",
    "in the ground - state , cu has essentially the configuration d@xmath29 and all the ligand orbitals are filled . in the presence of a cu core hole , it becomes energetically favorable to transfer an electron from a ligand to the d - shell , obtaining a @xmath30 configuration on the cu atom with the core hole . due to the hybridization between the d@xmath29 and @xmath31 configurations ,",
    "the states are actually mixtures of the two configurations , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] . in the photoemission process",
    "there is a nonzero probability that the outer electron will not stay on the ligand , but is transferred to the lower energy @xmath32-like state .",
    "this `` shake - down '' process corresponds to the leading peak in the spectrum , while the process where the outer electron stays on the ligand corresponds to the satellite .",
    "this kind of model has been applied to rare earth compounds,@xcite chemisorption systems,@xcite transition metal compounds,@xcite and high @xmath0 compounds.@xcite    our simple model allows an accurate numerical calculation of the photocurrent either by integrating the time - dependent schrdinger equation or by directly inverting a resolvent operator ( qm ) .",
    "we also derive analytic results with a separable potential .",
    "these results are compared with the semi - classical theory ( sc ) , and with first order perturbation theory ( pt ) . in both these cases we have analytic results , which is very useful for understanding the physics of the problem .",
    "the impurity model discussed here differs in certain important aspects from a real solid . to start with , for a solid",
    "we never reach the limit of a pure intrinsic spectrum since when the cross section for extrinsic scattering goes to zero , the range from which the photoelectrons come goes to infinity . in our impurity model ,",
    "on the other hand , the extrinsic scattering approaches zero at high kinetic energies .",
    "secondly , for a solid , we discuss excitations in the continuum and not as here discrete energy levels .    for the coupling to plasmons , the adiabatic - sudden transition takes place at large kinetic energies where the sc approximation is very accurate.@xcite the relevant length scale is given by the plasmon wave length @xmath33 and the relevant time by the inverse plasmon frequency @xmath34 .",
    "large interference effects are then connected with a large phase velocity @xmath35 , as discussed e.g. by inglesfield.@xcite since long wave - length plasmons play an important role these large interference effects for small @xmath36 delay the approach to the sudden limit , which only is reached at very high kinetic energies ( @xmath14 kev ) .    for the localized excitations studied here",
    "the relevant length scale is much shorter .",
    "the sc theory then predicts that the transition takes place at correspondingly smaller kinetic energies .",
    "this is indeed what we find from the exact solution of our model .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "firstly , the sc treatment itself is not valid at such small energies , and we have to rely on qm treatments .",
    "actually , although the sc treatment correctly predicts a small transition energy , we find it predicts qualitatively wrong dependencies on the relevant parameters .",
    "secondly , the smaller energy scale means that the energy variation of the dipole matrix elements becomes very important .",
    "the dipole matrix element grows rapidly on an energy scale @xmath37 , which can become very important for the adiabatic - sudden transition .",
    "we study the ratio @xmath1 between the weights of the satellite and the main peak as a function of the photon energy @xmath2 for the emission from a @xmath38 level .",
    "first we consider the case when the scattering potential between the electron and the target is neglected .",
    "we find that the corresponding ratio @xmath4 strongly depends on the ratio between the excitation energy @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath39 , @xmath4 approaches its limiting value from below , while it has an overshoot if @xmath40 . in both case",
    "the limit value is reached for photoelectron energies of the order of a few times @xmath5 .",
    "we then study the effects of the scattering potential by focusing on @xmath41 . for small energies",
    "there is typically an overshoot due to _ constructive _ interference in the  shake - down  case , contrary to the shake - up case where , like for plasmons , @xmath42 is reduced by interaction effects .",
    "this happens on the energy scale @xmath9 .",
    "if the scattering potential is very strong , this overshoot may extend to several times @xmath9 . depending on the parameters",
    "there may be an undershoot for higher energies , which can extend up to quite high energies .",
    "the undershoot is , however , rather small for the parameters we consider here , and should therefore not be very important unless we want to calculate the spectrum with a high accuracy . for cu compounds and emission from the @xmath38 core level , we find that @xmath43 and @xmath12 are comparable , and the relevant energy for @xmath11 is then given by @xmath44 .",

    "the core level is filled in the initial state , and empty in the final , and @xmath51 only enters as a constant .",

    "one of the main results of this paper is that for a coupling to localized excitations , the adiabatic to sudden transition takes place at quite small kinetic energies of the photoelectron .",
