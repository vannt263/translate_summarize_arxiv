    "the low - temperature radiative recombination of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with photoexited holes is an effective optical probe of the many - body interactions and their modification under a magnetic field that is applied perpendicularly ( @xmath2 ) to the 2d - electron layer .",
    "kinks in the @xmath2-dependence of the photoluminescence ( pl ) peak energy , the pl line broadening and the intensity changes for integral and fractional 2d - electron filling factors @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the 2deg density , @xmath5 is the magnetic length ) were reported .",
    "@xcite the most remarkable pl - modifications were observed in structure having a large 2d - electron - valence hole ( 2d e - h ) separation , @xmath1 , since then the holes weakly affect the many - body interactions of the 2deg .",
    "examples are asymmetrically modulation - doped , gaas / algaas quantum wells ( mdqw ) ( with a qw - width exceeding 20 nm ) @xcite and single gaas / algaas heterojunctions ( hj).@xcite    in the latter case , the photoexcited electron - hole pairs are rapidly separated by the built - in hj electric field ( over distances of @xmath6 nm within the entire undoped gaas layer ) . due to the small 2d electron - hole wavefunction overlap , their emission intensity is negligibly low and the pl spectrum of high quality hj s , in the absence or at low @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) , is dominated by emission of excitons from the undoped ( p - type ) gaas layer .",
    "@xcite however for filling factor @xmath8 , this excitonic pl transforms into a 2d e - h pl involving transitions between the lowest e - h landau levels .",
    "this changeover in hjs was considered to reflect an increased 2d e - h wavefunction overlap with increasing @xmath2 ( at @xmath92 ) @xcite , but its physical mechanism is not fully understood .",
    "recently , we proposed that the interaction of free excitons in the gaas buffer layer and the magnetized 2deg forming on the gaas / algaas interface , leads to an exciton dissociation into 2d - electron and free hole at @xmath92 .",
    "the excitons drift to the 2deg in the gradient of the built - in hj electric field .",
    "thus , the exciton drift and its dissociation deliver free holes to the 2d - e .",
    "@xcite    in order to elucidate the effect of the 2d - electron - hole separation on the pl spectrum , we studied the pl of gaas / algaas hj s and mdqw s under a magnetic field that was applied parallel to the 2deg plane , @xmath0 .",
    "extensive transport and magnetoabsorption studies of the 2deg under @xmath0 , were reported , @xcite but there are only a few reports on the @xmath0-effects on the 2deg pl in mdqws .",
    "@xcite a noticeable case is the effect of @xmath0 on the spatially indirect exciton pl in biased double quantum wells .",
    "@xcite we report on drastic @xmath0-induced pl spectral changes in high quality 25nm - width mdqw s and in hj s as well as on their dependence on the 2d e - h separation .",
    "we present a model that is based on the conduction and valence subband realignment under @xmath0 that accounts qualitativily for the observed spectral modifications .",
    "the effect of a @xmath1 decrease with @xmath0 on the pl spectrum of hjs , is also considered .",
    "an in - plane @xmath0 that is applied along the x - axis , creates a crossed fields configuration with the perpendicular , built - in electric field @xmath10 ( directed along the z - axis ) that exists in the asymmetrically modulation - doped structures containing a 2deg .",
    "this causes an in - plane electron ( hole ) drift ( in the y - direction , perpendicular to @xmath0 ) , resulting in a deformation of the subband energy surfaces , @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite in particular , the conduction subband minimum shifts to a higher wave vector , @xmath12=@xmath13 ( where @xmath5 is the magnetic length ) and the in - plane electron effective mass ( @xmath14 ) increases along the y - direction .",
    "@xcite thus , an indirect bandgap appears , and the 2deg - free hole pl spectrum that originates in the direct optical transitions , is strongly modified .    in order to describe the spectral modifications",
    ", we use the general expression for the spectrum of the 2de - h radiative recombination .",
    "@xcite the pl intensity at a photon energy @xmath15 is @xmath16 here @xmath17 are the band gap , electron and hole in - plane energies , and @xmath18 are the fermi distribution function for 2d - electrons and the boltzmann distribution function for nondegenerate holes , respectively . in the direct band gap limit ( @xmath0 = 0 ) , all optical transitions with a given @xmath19 occur at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the reduced electron - hole effective mass ) . thus , the pl spectrum is described by @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 .    in the presence of @xmath0",
    ", direct optical transitions occur between the valence and conduction subbands that are displaced in @xmath25-space away from each other by @xmath26/ @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the momentum and energy conservation laws require that for given @xmath19 and @xmath28 : @xmath29^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and conduction ( and valence ) band states of @xmath30 energies participate in the optical transitions at the same photon energy .",
    "the optical transitions at @xmath19 involve states with @xmath28 varying between @xmath31 and @xmath32 that are the roots of the eq.2 ( at @xmath33 ) .",
    "then , integrating eq.1 once , we obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35exp@xmath36 , @xmath37exp@xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are the effective electron and hole temperatures , and @xmath41 is the fermi energy in the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "we note that @xmath42 since @xmath14 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    in figure  1 , numerically calculated pl spectra are presented for several @xmath12 values that correspond to increasing @xmath0 values . the pl peak intensities are obtained from the condition of b - independent spectrally - integrated pl . in the presence of @xmath0 , the lowest pl energy shifts by @xmath43 and the pl spectrum is strongly deformed , particularly at large @xmath12 .",
    "this results from a change of number of the occupied free - hole states participating in the recombination process .",
    "for example , as @xmath12 increases , the direct optical transitions between the 2d - electrons at @xmath44 and the lowest energy , highly populated valence hole states , have become available .",
    "this leads to a pronounced pl intensity enhancement at @xmath44 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "the pl spectral evolution with increasing @xmath45 is shown in figs .",
    "1a , b for two values of the 2deg density .",
    "these spectra demonstrate that the main effect of @xmath0 is not an enhanced diamagnetic shift ( see eq.3 ) as was considered before , @xcite but the drastic modification of the entire 2de - h pl spectrum .",
    "for example , the lowest optical transition shifts by @xmath46mev at @xmath47@xmath48 ( @xmath0 = 7 t and @xmath1=18 nm ) , while the pl peak - energy shift depends on the 2deg density and reaches  7mev at @xmath49 @xmath50 ( see figs .",
    "1a , b ) .",
    "the energy distribution of the photoexcited free holes participating in the 2de - h pl , strongly affects the pl spectrum under @xmath0 .",
    "the energy distribution of the holes can be different from that corresponding to the lattice temperature ( @xmath51 ) because the radiative recombination rate is higher than the energy relaxation rate in the mdqw at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite in order to demonstrate the effect of the nonthermalized holes on the pl , we display the pl spectra calculated for the effective hole temperature @xmath40 = 4k ( dashed lines in fig .  1 ) .",
    "@xmath39 is taken to be equal to @xmath51=1.9k , since the photoelectron rapidly loses its energy by the electron - electron scattering process occurring in the dense 2deg .",
    "due to the heavier hole mass and the spatial separation of the holes and 2deg , the efficiency of the hole-2deg energy relaxation is lower , and @xmath40 is taken to be different of @xmath39 .",
    "one can see in fig .  1 that the high - energy valence states occupied by nonthermalized holes , result in a pronounce pl spectral modification under increased @xmath0 .",
    "the pl spectra shown in fig .",
    "1 were calculated with @xmath52 . the dotted curve in fig .",
    "1b shows the calculated pl spectrum for @xmath53 -dependence with @xmath54@xmath48 ( @xmath55 is a numerical coefficient ) .",
    "the larger @xmath14 leads to a pl band narrowing and a low - energy shift of the pl peak due to fermi energy decrease .",
    "thus , the strong @xmath0 effect on the 2de - h pl spectrum is predicted by this simple model . for a mdqw in which @xmath4 can be varied ,",
    "larger spectral modifications are expected at higher @xmath4 since @xmath1 increases with @xmath4 due to the increased built - in electric field .",
    "our analysis does not include the `` usual '' diamagnetic shift .",
    "the value of this small shift ( @xmath56 mev at 7 t ) is close to the exciton diamagnetic shift under @xmath0 as measured for undoped 20 nm wide qw ( see below , fig .  3 ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath0 is expected to be different in wide hj s , since @xmath1 is large , and it varies with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest estimate of @xmath1 in a hj at @xmath0 = 0 , can be obtained by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the valence hole drift velocity in the hj electric field @xmath10",
    "( @xmath59 is the hole mobility ) and @xmath60 is the characteristic recombination time of the hole ( due to capture by charged acceptors in the buffer p - type gaas layer ) . taking @xmath61 @xmath62/vsec @xcite and a minimal value of @xmath10 = @xmath63 v / cm and @xmath64s , we obtain @xmath65 cm .",
    "the photoexcited holes are thus accumulating at a large distance where @xmath10 diminishes .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 is of the order of the gaas buffer layer width ( @xmath66 ) , and it is much larger than that in the mdqws .    in the presence of @xmath0 , the hole drift from the interface",
    "is slowed down , since it exhibits a helical motion along the y - direction ( in @xmath10- @xmath0 crossed fields configuration ) .",
    "the hole drift velocity can be written ( in a classical approach ) as : @xmath67 $ ] , ( @xmath68 is the light velocity ) .",
    "then , for @xmath691 t ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath1 strongly decreases , reaching values @xmath71 cm at @xmath69 2 t .",
    "thus , the spatial distribution of photoexcited holes ( in the buffer gaas layer ) is mainly determined by the incident light penetration depth .",
    "the hole density near the 2deg layer increases while the density of holes situated away from hj decreases .",
    "fewer holes are available to form excitons in the buffer gaas layer , and the exciton pl intensity decreases while that of the 2de - h pl is enhanced with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "it is important to underline that the discussed pl modifications in @xmath0 are only relevant for free holes that recombine with momentum conservation . in the case of recombination of localized holes with 2deg ,",
    "the spectral pl modifications are expected to be small since indirect optical transitions without @xmath25-conservation are allowed .",
    "the pl spectroscopic study was performed on several gaas / algaas hj and mdqw samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "the hj samples have a thick gaas buffer layer ( widths of @xmath66 ) and the mdqw samples have a single 25nm - wide qw . the 2deg densities and dc mobilities at 4k vary in the ranges of @xmath72 @xmath50 and @xmath73 @xmath74/vsec , respectively .",
    "photoexcitation was done by illumination with a ti - sapphire laser light ( photon energy of 1.56 ev ) or by a he - ne laser .",
    "the incident light intensity was kept below @xmath75w/@xmath74 .",
    "the he - ne laser photon energy ( 1.96ev ) is greater than the band gap of the algaas barrier , thus , @xmath4 can be reduced due to optical depletion by increasing the he - ne laser intensity .",
    "@xcite the pl spectra were measured with a high resolution by using a double spectrometer equipped with a ccd camera .",
    "the samples were immersed in liquid he at temperature @xmath51= 1.9k , and photoexcitation and pl detection were performed perpendicularly to the 2deg plane under an in - plane @xmath0 .    figs .",
    "2a - c display the pl spectral evolution with increasing @xmath0 measured on two mdqw samples . at @xmath76",
    ", pl spectra can be well described by a simple product of the distribution functions for the 2d electrons of density @xmath4 at the electron temperature @xmath39=@xmath51 and nondegenerate holes with effective @xmath40 ( eq.1 ) .",
    "@xcite the 2deg fermi energy is then estimated from the 2de - h pl bandwidth . upon applying @xmath0 , the pl spectra show remarkable modifications : a high - energy shift , intensity redistribution , and band narrowing .",
    "2a presents the pl spectra of the mdqw with @xmath77@xmath50 at @xmath0=0 , 4.5 and 7 t and the calculated spectra for @xmath78 and @xmath79@xmath48 for @xmath39=1.9k , @xmath40= 4k .",
    "a @xmath1 value of 15 nm can be estimated from the comparison of these spectra .",
    "2b , c show the effect of varying @xmath4 on the pl spectral evolution under @xmath0 .",
    "the pl spectra are measured on the same mdqw with @xmath80@xmath50 under two he - ne laser intensities ( under optical depletion ) .",
    "as @xmath4 is reduced , less spectral modifications are observed since @xmath1 decreases .",
    "the total width of the 2de - h pl spectra ( @xmath81 ) , decreases with @xmath0 . at @xmath0=7 t",
    ", @xmath44 decreases by 1.5 - 1.3 times as a result of an electron mass enhancement.@xcite    the observed pl spectra display the main features predicted by the simple model of sec ii .",
    "this model does not accounts for the @xmath0-effect on the electron(hole ) wavefunctions , but we assume that the discrepancy between the calculated and observed pl spectra may result from the nonthermalized hole distribution function , which is not described by the boltzman distribution with the effective @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath0 dependencies of the integrated pl intensity ( @xmath82 ) and the energy @xmath83 that was obtained by extrapolating the pl intensity of low energy part of spectrum to zero , are shown in fig .",
    "we note that the integrated pl intensity varies only slightly with @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath83 is presented for a mdqw at two 2deg densities , @xmath84 @xmath50 and @xmath85 @xmath50 ( curves 1 and 2 , respectively ) .",
    "these dependencies are compared with the behavior of the exciton pl peak energy versus @xmath0 that was measured in the 20nm - wide undoped qw ( curve 3 ) .",
    "@xmath86 in the mdqw varies with @xmath4 , and it strongly depends on @xmath0 when compared with the exciton diamagnetic shift in undoped qw .",
    "4 displays the pl spectra of the hj sample upon applying a _ perpendicular _ magnetic field , @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "4a ) and a parallel field , @xmath0 ( figs .",
    "4b , c ) . figs .",
    "4b and c show the pl spectra for the same hj ( @xmath87 @xmath50 ) under photoexcitation with @xmath88=1.52 ev and 1.96 ev ( under optical depletion ) , respectively . at @xmath89=0 ,",
    "the pl spectrum consists of two strong narrow lines originating in free and bound excitons of gaas buffer layer . @xcite with decreasing @xmath4 ( fig  4c ) , the built - in electric field decreases , holes are situated closer to the heterointerface , and the broad 2de - h pl band appears at @xmath76 . under photoexcitation that does not vary @xmath4 ( figs .",
    "4a , b ) , the 2de - h pl can be detected as a low - energy low - intense background pl .",
    "these broad pl bands are due to a radiative recombination of the photoexcited holes and 2d - electrons whose wavefunctions weakly overlap at @xmath76 . at @xmath90 3.2 t ( @xmath912 ) , the pl changeover occurs , and",
    "the 2de - h pl intensity sharply enhances while the exciton pl intensity decreases ( fig .",
    "@xcite another drastic 2de - h pl modification is observed near @xmath911 ( @xmath92 6.5 - 7 t ) .",
    "@xcite    the pl evolution with applying in - plane @xmath0 is shown in figs .  4b , c. starting from low @xmath0 , an increase of the 2de - h pl ( low - energy pl tail ) intensity and an narrowing of the band with @xmath0 are clearly observed .",
    "a redistribution between the 2de - h and exciton integrated pl intensities with increasing @xmath0 is presented in inset of fig .",
    "a _ smooth _",
    "changeover from the exciton to the 2d - e - h pl under @xmath93 is revealed .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the sharp , 2deg density - dependent changeover observed under @xmath2.@xcite    the 2d - e - h pl intensity enhancement seen in figs .",
    "4b , c , results from the @xmath0-induced delivering of free holes to the heterointerface while the narrowing and spectral pl shift is caused by the effect of @xmath0 on the pl spectral shape .",
    "indeed , with increasing @xmath0 , the photoexcited holes are swept away for smaller distances , and increased number of the holes can recombine with 2d - electrons giving rise to the 2de - h pl .",
    "there is a set of the @xmath1 -values because the holes are spatially distributed in gaas buffer layer .",
    "this leads to a specific pl spectrum having a long low - energy tail since the pl intensity strongly reduces with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , @xmath1 decreases , however @xmath1 is large enough so that @xmath12 is high , and the pl line shape at @xmath0=7 t corresponds to the pl spectrum calculated for @xmath94@xmath48 as one can see in fig . 1 .    in fig .  5",
    ", we compare the hj pl spectra under parallel ( curves 1,4 ) , normal ( curve 2 ) and @xmath95-tilted magnetic field ( curve 3 ) . the spectra presented by curves 1 and 2 are obtained at @xmath0= 5 t and @xmath2=5 t , respectively .",
    "the high - energy , excitonic part of both spectra are at the same energies , and it is independent of the b - orientation . the excitonic part of the spectrum under tilted magnetic field ( @xmath96=5 t , curve 3)is similar to that measured at @xmath0=7 t ( curve 4 ) .",
    "both these facts give evidence to the bulk nature of the high - energy part of the pl spectrum in the hj .",
    "the 2de - h parts of the pl spectra obtained under @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( curves 1 and 2 ) are completely different , and these differ from that observed under tilted magnetic field . in the latter case , the 2de - h pl originates in the radiative recombination from the lowest e - h landau levels ( due to @xmath2-component ) while an additional spectral shift @xmath97 is caused by @xmath0-component .",
    "the value of this shift is of 1.8mev , and the 2de - h separation of 25 nm can be estimated by using eq .",
    "3 . thus applying @xmath0=5 t , leads to a reduced hole drift that results in the strong 2de - h pl enhancement .",
    "in conclusion , our study shows that in - plane magnetic field leads to a remarkable spectral modification of the 2deg - hole pl in mdqws and shjs .",
    "the smooth intensity redistribution between the pl of the bulk excitons and of the 2deg is revealed in hjs .",
    "this is caused by the effect of @xmath0 on the free hole distribution in the hj .",
    "the 2de - h pl evolution studied upon applying @xmath0 , evidences that free holes are responsible for this emission in the high quality hjs .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the sharp pl changeover observed at @xmath982 in hjs under perpendicularly applied @xmath2 , is induced by a threshold spatial redistribution of the free holes whose possible physical mechanism was recently proposed .",
