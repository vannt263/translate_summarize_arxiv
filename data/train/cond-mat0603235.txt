    "investigations on the spin - dependent transport in a magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) have attracted much interest in the last decade , as the mtjs have essential applications in spintronic devicesprinz , wolf , zutic , maekawa , su .",
    "one of phenomena in mtjs is the so - called tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect , which states that the tunneling current through the junction depends sensitively on the relative orientation of the magnetizations of both ferromagnetic electrodes , that is caused by the spin - dependent scattering of conduction electrons .",
    "the difference between the currents through spin up and down channels in mtjs is usually referred to as the spin current@xcite . on the other hand , a reverse effect to tmr",
    "was predicted independently by slonczewski@xcite and berger@xcite , i.e. , the spin - polarized electrons passing from the left ferromagnetic layer into the right layer in which the magnetization deviates the left by an angle may exert a torque to the right ferromagnet and can change the orientation of its magnetization .",
    "this effect was coined as the spin transfer effect ( for review , see e.g. ref.@xcite ) , which can lead to the current - induced magnetization reversal , and might offer a promise for the current - controlled spintronic devices .",
    "it has recently attracted intensive investigations both experimentallytsoi , myers , katine , wegrowe , sun , asamitsu and theoreticallywaintal , brataas , zhu , tserkovnyak , x.waintal , brouwer , mu , parcollet .    among other magnetic tunnel structures ( e.g. refs.@xcite ) , the ferromagnet - quantum dot - ferromagnet ( fm - qd - fm )",

    "previous theoretical works on spin - dependent transport through qds are mainly focused on the tunnel electrical current and the tmr effect for collinear configurationbarnas , fransson , zhang , bulka , lopez , martinek , pedersen and noncollinear configurationsergueev , konig , zhu1,braun , rudzinski , wetzels , fran1,fran2,weymann . however , the investigations on the spin current and the current - induced spin transfer torque ( cistt ) in such systems are sparsely reported .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the spin current and spin transfer torque in fm - qd - fm coupled mtjs .    in terms of keldysh s nonequilibrium green function method , the tunnel electrical current , the spin current and the spin transfer torque in the fm - qd - fm coupled system will be investigated .",
    "it is found the spin current exhibits different behaviors from its electrical counterpart .",
    "it is also shown that the resonant positions for the tunneling electrical current and spin current become far separated with the increase of the coulomb interaction @xmath0 in the qd .",
    "the magnitudes of the cistt at two resonant positions are found to be greatly enhanced at resonant positions . at the bias larger than @xmath1 ,",
    "the cistt can reach a saturation plateau which is independent of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the cistt shows a kink - like behavior with the increase of the spin current .",

    "8 are almost unchanged , showing that the coulomb interaction has less effect on the cistt versus @xmath159 and @xmath117 , as well as @xmath130 versus @xmath159 .",
    "this is because the coulomb interaction @xmath0 only changes the resonant positions .",
    "we have investigated the spin - dependent transport properties in a fm - qd - fm coupled system by means of the nonequilibrium green functions .",
    "it has been found that by changing the relative orientation of both magnetizations , the spin current can change its magnitude even its sign . for positive bias voltages ,",
    "when the relative orientation angle is less than @xmath160 , the spin current shows a step - like behavior , and the spin current is positive ; when the relative orientation angle is greater than @xmath160 , the spin current behaviors similar to a basin - like shape , and is negative at the bottom of the `` basin '' . with increasing the coulomb interaction @xmath0 in the qd , it has been uncovered that the resonant positions for the tunneling electrical current and spin current become far separated .",
    "the cistt is observed to first increase slowly to a sharp peak with increasing the bias voltage , then decrease dramatically to almost zero ; and after undergoing an unchanged stage , it increases suddenly to another plateau .",
    "such a behavior is obviously resulted from the resonant tunneling through the central qd .",
    "the magnitudes of the cistt at two resonant positions are observed to increase with increasing the polarization of the ferromagnet . at the bias larger than @xmath1",
    ", the cistt is seen to reach a saturation plateau which is independent of the coulomb interaction .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated that the cistt as a function of the spin current shows a kink - like behavior , and away from the kink , the cistt increases almost linearly with increasing the spin current .",
    "the cistt as a function of the electrical current shows a non - monotonic behavior , while the spin current is found to be nonlinearly proportional to the electrical current . besides",
    ", the coulomb interaction is shown to have less effect on the behaviors of the cistt as functions of the tunneling electrical current and spin current , as well as the spin current as a function of the electrical current .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the cistt can be greatly enhanced when the bias voltage meets with the discrete levels of the qd at two resonant positions . while the energy level of the qd can be adjusted by tuning the gate voltage , the resonant property of the cistt offers an alternative premise to develop a spintronic device through the current - controlled magnetization reversal effect .    we have benefitted from discussions with b. jin , z. c. wang , and z. g. zhu .",
