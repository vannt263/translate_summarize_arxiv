    "open clusters ( ocs ) are very good tracers of the galactic disc properties , of its formation and evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , ocs can be used to study the metallicity distribution in the disc and its possible evolution with time . with the bocce ( bologna open cluster chemical evolution ) project ,",
    "described in detail by @xcite , we are deriving precise and homogeneous ages , distances , reddenings and chemical abundances for a large sample of ocs .",
    "the final goal is to study the present status of the galactic disc , its formation and evolution .",
    "since the least known epochs of the disc evolution are the earliest ones , we put particular attention to the study of old clusters . adding the present three old systems to those already described in @xcite , to be  17 @xcite ,",
    "be  32 and king  11 @xcite , we have already examined 17 clusters older than 1 gyr , out of the about 190 listed in the @xcite catalogue .    as part of this project ,",
    "we present here a photometric study of three clusters : ( a ) berkeley  20 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , in the third galactic quadrant ) ; ( b ) berkeley  66 ( @xmath8 , @xmath922 , in the second galactic quadrant ) ; and ( c ) tombaugh  2 ( @xmath10 , @xmath1188 , in the third galactic quadrant ) .",
    "they are old , distant clusters , and their properties are important to understand the nature of the outer galactic disc .",
    "in fact , they all lie in the region between about 12 and 16 kpc from the galactic centre , where the radial metallicity distribution seems to change its slope ( see sect .  [ discussion ] ) . furthermore , to  2 has been connected with the monoceros ring and the canis major overdensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? *",
    "see also sect .",
    "[ lit - to2 ] ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ lit ] we give a short description of what is already available on these clusters in literature , while in sect .",
    "[ data ] we describe our data and the reduction procedure . in sect .",
    "[ cmd ] we present the cmds and in sect .  [ param ] we detail the cluster parameter derivation .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ discussion ] is dedicated to a summary and discussion , in particular of the radial galactocentric metallicity gradient and the importance of the three clusters in this context .    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - param ]",
    "we compared the cmds of the three old , distant ocs be  20 , be  66 , and to  2 to synthetic ones based on three different sets of evolutionary tracks and determined the clusters parameters .",
    "table  [ tab - param ] gives a summary of the derived parameters for the three ocs .",
    "we use here the values based on the bbc tracks , even when they do not offer the best - fitting solution ( e.g. , for be  66 ) , in analogy to what we did in @xcite to obtain a homogeneous ranking on a single scale .    *",
    "all three clusters are less metal - rich than the sun , with best = fitting solutions of z=0.008 - 0.01 ( depending on the set of tracks ) for be  20 and to  2 , and z=0.006 for be  66 .",
    "these rather precise values could be obtained because we considered the simultaneous good fit of both the @xmath12 and @xmath13 cmds . *",
    "the reddenings slightly depend on the tracks metallicity . for be  66 ,",
    "we confirm @xcite s suggestion of a probable differential reddening , of the order of 2 - 3 per cent , a rather likely occurrence given the high extinction level .",
    "* for all clusters a binary fraction of about 30 per cent seems necessary to well reproduce the width of the observed sequences .",
    "* the derived ages depend on the treatment of convection adopted in the evolutionary tracks , with the usual lower values found for tracks without overshooting . * our results on age ,",
    "distance and reddening do not significantly differ from the most recently published ones for be  20 and to  2 .",
    "we find be  66 slightly younger , closer , and definitely metal poorer than @xcite , while we agree with them on the reddening and with @xcite on the rather low metallicity .",
    "* as already anticipated in sect",
    ".  [ intro ] , these ocs have galactocentric radii of about 12 to 16 kpc and are then useful to constrain the properties of the outer disc , in particular in what seems to be a transition region for the metallicity distribution ( see below ) .    * the galactocentric metallicity gradient - * even if the number of known old ocs has steadily grown in the last years , they still are a minority , since the @xcite catalogue contains about 2000 objects , and only about 190 are older than 1 gyr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - old ] ) .",
    "an even smaller number of clusters has the metallicity determined using high - resolution spectroscopy ( see below ) . in the bocce project",
    "we have especially targeted old clusters , hence our ocs represent a fair sample of the old cluster population , about 10 per cent . in fig .",
    "[ fig - old ] we also show for comparison the same histogram for our sample , 4 gyr @xcite , in line with other determinations , and c ) ngc  6791 is attributed an age , 4.4 gyr , younger than found in all recent papers , where its age is 7 - 9 gyr ( see , e.g , * ? ? ? * ) . ] and indicate the three clusters analysed here in the enlargement .",
    "the metallicity distribution in the disc is an important ingredient of chemical evolutionary models , and offers essential information on the formation and evolution of the disc , especially when also its possible evolution with time is considered .",
    "we may obtain the present - day metallicity distribution from o , b stars and h ii regions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility are cepheids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for which the distance and age can be determined with high precision .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are another tracer , and they are in principle able to reach further in the past ( see , e.g. , the recent paper by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , there still are difficulties in assigning individual ages and distances .",
    "this is in general true for all field stars ; the most accurate parallaxes to date , those measured by the hipparcos space mission , are available only for the sun s vicinity .",
    "ground - based catalogues can reach farther away , but at the price of accuracy .",
    "hst parallaxes can be very precise , but only a handful of targets has been observed . to obtain precise distances for hundred millions stars in the whole galaxy",
    "we will have to wait about 10 years , for the completion of the gaia satellite survey .",
    "furthermore , all stars are subject to orbit migration ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* in the recent years ) ; they move away from their birthplace even several kpc , thus complicating the study of the metallicity distribution : at any given @xmath14 we may find stars born there , or in an inner ( i.e. , in general more metal - rich ) or in an outer ( i.e. , in general more metal - poor ) region of the disc .",
    "ocs are less subject to all these problems : their distances and ages can be measured with sufficient precision using the stellar models ( e.g. , as we do in our bocce project , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their abundances can be determined from several or many member stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they do not appear to suffer from orbit migration .",
    "for the last point , see e.g. , @xcite , who computed the orbits of about 500 ocs , using information from @xcite .",
    "when they derive the slope of the metallicity gradient using @xmath14 or the apogalacticon radius , they do not find any significant difference .",
    "apart from a few exceptions , it appears safe to use ocs and their present - day positions , to define the metallicity distribution now and in the past .",
    "this is part of our goals , and we are building the bocce sample choosing ocs which cover the whole distribution of clusters properties .",
    "of course , the situation will further improve when it will be possible to compute orbits for the whole family of ocs , using the improved distances , proper motions , and radial velocities produced by gaia .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ grad1](a ) the radial metallicity gradient described by ocs using the information in the @xcite catalogue .",
    "we computed @xmath14 using 8 kpc as the sun distance from the galactic centre , and the tabulated distances from the sun .",
    "values for [ fe / h ] come from photometry ( cmd , narrow - band , indices ) , low resolution , and high resolution spectroscopy ; individual references can be found at the dias webpage ( http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/@xmath15wilton/ ) .",
    "we display with filled ( red ) symbols the postion of be  20 , be  66 , and to  2 , using the tabulated values .",
    "the metallicity tends to decline from the centre to the outskirts of the disc .",
    "if we fit the distribution with a single relation , we find a decline rate of @xmath16 , as indicated in the figure .",
    "however , recent studies of open clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest that a better representation is a gradient in the inner region ( @xmath1712 kpc from the centre ) followed by an almost flat value therefore .",
    "we then divided the sample of ocs accordingly , computing a ( steeper ) inner slope of @xmath18 .",
    "the ocs in the external part have in this case an average metallicity of = -0.35 dex . while the number of ocs in this sample is large ( 177 objects ) , they tend to lie mostly in the sun s vicinity , with only about 15 per cent of them with @xmath19 kpc , and only a handful in the outermost disc regions .",
    "furthermore , the sample is completely inhomogeneous .     and [ fe / h ]",
    "are taken from dias et al .",
    "the two lines represent the fit to the data using a single slope ( in blue ) or two , within 12 kpc from the galactic centre and farther than this limit ( in red ) , see text .",
    "the three clusters of the present paper are indicated by filled ( red ) squares .",
    "( b)the same , but using only 72 ocs older than 0.1 gyr and for which the metallicity has been derived with high - resolution spectroscopy ( the three clusters are shown with larger symbols ) ; filled , light - blue squares indicate ocs for which [ fe / h ] has been determined by our group . ]    in principle , choosing only [ fe / h ] measured using high resolution spectroscopy produces more solid results .",
    "we have searched the literature and retrieved the metallicity , distance , and age of about 70 clusters .",
    "a good fraction of them , about 30 per cent , are also in the bocce sample and are indicated with filled symbols in the figure ; we show the three clusters of the present paper with larger symbols , this time using the parameters derived in the present paper and the [ fe / h ] values indicated in table  [ deltav ] .",
    "we restricted our search to clusters older than 0.1 gyr and selected in each case either the most recent determination or our measures , when present .",
    "the resulting metallicity distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ grad1](b ) .",
    "the slopes derived are ( almost ) the same as in the previous case . in this case",
    ", however , there is a better balance between inner and outer clusters , and the individual values are more precise ( but again , with a caveat on the inhomogeneity of sources , which produces systematics ) .",
    "be  66 , to  2 , and be  20 , in order of increasing distance from the centre , are an important addition , since they are about one fifth of the entire outer - disc sample .",
    "this second sample of ocs can also be used to study the behaviour of the gradient with time . in fig .",
    "[ grad2 ] we divide the sample in three parts and compute the slope of the gradients ( only in the inner 12 kpc ) again , with the three clusters hightlighted .",
    "while young and intermediate age clusters seem to share the same behaviour , the slope of the gradient seems to have been steeper in the past ( as found also for pne ) .",
    "this has to be accounted for by any chemical evolution model .",
    "note however the paucity of very old clusters at the transition between a decreasing and flat distribution of metallicities ; this calls for new additions to the well - studied cluster sample .",
    "we plan to repeat these exercises using only clusters in the bocce sample , with ages , distances , and [ fe / h ] all derived on the same scale .",
    "the importance of be  20 , be  66 , and to  2 lies both in their old ages and in their large @xmath14 ( see e.g. , the sample map in @xcite ) .",
    "be  66 is the outermost cluster in the second quadrant , while be  20 and to  2 fill the large gap in @xmath14 between be  29 ( at 20.8 kpc ) and be  22 ( at 14.0 kpc ) .",
    "notice that in the literature very few clusters have been studied beyond a radius of 16 kpc .",
    "for instance , @xcite list only be  31 , be  73 , be  25 , saurer  1 , and be  29 .",
    "different interpretations of the two - slopes metallicity distribution are possible , either a normal outcome of disc formation and chemical enrichment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or satellite accretion in the outer disc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the former suggestion likely foresees a continuous radial distribution ( even if with different slopes , maybe even zero , in different regions ) , while the latter implies some inhomogeneity reflecting the satellite impact trajectory .",
    "it is then important to have as many clusters as possible outside the critical radius of 12 kpc , and to have them in different quadrants .",
    "we will use the information obtained here , together with the detailed chemical abundances from existing and future high resolution spectroscopic data , to increase the bocce set and derive conclusions based on a homogeneous analysis .",
