    "the macho project has been collecting photometry of stars in lmc fields for over 1400 days at this writing and has already provided a wealth of important new information on variable stars - see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is , naturally , great interest in the classical cepheid variables which are used to calibrate the extragalactic distance scale . at present",
    "our cepheid catalogue contains 1466 single - mode ( classical ) and 73 double - mode ( beat ) cepheids .",
    "most of these stars have between 300 and 1100 individual epochs of two - color photometry .",
    "we have determined periods for all stars using the full dataset and have generated finder charts , fourier amplitudes , phases , and ratios and will submit a full analysis of these results in the near future .",
    "this paper contains a brief summary of interesting intermediate results , including a list of improved period ratios for lmc beat cepheids .",
    "the properties of lightcurve shapes are observables which are not affected by reddening or distance . furthermore , both the photometry and period of light variation",
    "can usually be determined with high precision .",
    "therefore , it is of considerable interest to investigate whether lightcurve shape is correlated with other physical quantities that are , in practice , more difficult to determine , such as position in the instability strip , pulsation mode , and metallicity .",
    "fourier coefficients for lmc cepheids have been most recently discussed by @xcite . as a by - product of a search for evidence of microlensing toward the lmc , the eros collaboration detected 72 cepheids in their 0.4 square degree field .",
    "approximately 1000 epochs of photometry in the b and r bandpasses were obtained .",
    "they discuss the low - order fourier coefficients so derived .",
    "we have undertaken fourier decomposition of our lightcurves for order n=12 using the technique described by @xcite .",
    "the quality of our fourier fits has been significantly improved by the length of the time series - now three to four times as long as that reported in @xcite .",
    "the division between overtone and fundamental cepheids is now even more distinct and there is also an obvious dependance of @xmath7 on the amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "the so - called long - period @xmath9 cepheid sequence is also better defined .",
    "examples of the run of fourier parameters with photometric period are given in figure  [ figfour21 ] .",
    "the 2:1 resonance is clearly located by this data at @xmath10 p = 1.05 @xmath11 0.03 .",
    "the run of fourier parameters with period defined by this sample will ultimately be useful in defining a simple parameterization of lightcurve shape with period , peak - to - peak amplitude and bandpass .",
    "the metallicity sensitivity of the period ratios of beat cepheids make them especially interesting .",
    "the sample of 45 stars reported in @xcite has been enlarged and refined by the addition of two more years of observations .",
    "the periods and period ratios reported here were obtained by a simultaneous weighted least - squares fit to the principal frequencies and their harmonics , and mixing terms up to order 3 .",
    "table 1 contains improved period ratios for beat cepheids in the lmc .",
    "the columns , from left to right , are the designation using equinox j2000.0 coordinates , the internal identifier , the longest principal period in days , the ratio of the two periods present , and the mode identification .",
    "additional data on these stars will be presented in @xcite .",
    "we note that there are 75 entries in this table but that two of the stars are found in overlap regions of different fields and so the total number of distinct stars is 73 . a plot of period ratio versus period for the 75 entries is shown in figure  [ figbeatrat ] .",
    "we also present the @xmath12-band p - l relation using the longer of the two principal periods in figure  [ figpl ] .",
    "the lightcurve geometry of the 2h mode can be extracted from the existing 1h/2h lightcurves .",
    "we find that there is no significant power present at any of the harmonics of the 2h period .",
    "the fourier amplitude ratio @xmath7 is shown in figure  [ rtovsp ] as a function of period .",
    "note the two distinct sequences .",
    "@xmath7 seems to approach zero for the 2h mode when @xmath13 is about 1.2 days , which allows us to confine our search for singly - periodic 2h to below this period . the power spectrum for a typical 1h/2h cepheid is shown in figure  [ powspec ] .",
    "we have found a number of examples of stars which are apparently changing their amplitudes .",
    "the most spectacular of these is macho*05:12:08.3 - 68:32:11 which has a period of 0.763 days and may be an rr lyrae star .",
    "the @xmath12 lightcurve for this star is shown in figure  [ figampchange ] .",
