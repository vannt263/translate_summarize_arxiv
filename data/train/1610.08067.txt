    "the main tool to compute observable quantities in qft is perturbation theory . in gauge theories , and in yang - mills ( ym )",
    "theory in particular , a fundamental problem to solve in order to compute physical quantities is the over - counting of degrees of freedom related to gauge invariance ( for a detailed analysis see @xcite ) .",
    "the faddeev - popov ( fp ) gauge fixing procedure is the cornerstone which allows using the feynman rules and feynman diagrams in all applications of the standard model .",
    "the obvious fundamental hypothesis is that the gauge - fixing condition must intersect once and only once every gauge orbit .",
    "locally , in the space of gauge fields , this hypothesis requires that the fp operator should not have zero modes so that the fp determinant is different from zero .",
    "the reason is that the existence of a proper gauge transformation preserving the gauge - fixing would spoil the whole quantization procedure since it would imply that the fp recipe does not completely eliminate the over - counting of degrees of freedom .",
    "however , in @xcite , gribov showed that in non - abelian gauge theories ( in flat , topologically trivial space - times ) the fp procedure fails at non - perturbative level .",
    "the reason is that a proper gauge fixing is not possible due to the appearance of gribov copies : namely , gauge equivalent configurations satisfying the coulomb gauge .",
    "later , singer @xcite showed that if gribov ambiguities occur for the coulomb gauge , they occur for all gauge fixing conditions involving derivatives of the gauge field .",
    "naively , one could expect to completely avoid the gribov problem by simply choosing algebraic gauge fixings like the axial gauge or the temporal gauge , which are free of gribov copies . however , these choices have their own , and even worse , problems ( for a detailed reviews see @xcite @xcite ) . here",
    "it is just worth mentioning one serious issue : any loop computation in the algebraic gauge - fixings mentioned above are very difficult already beyond two - loop .",
    "hence , from the practical point of view , linear covariant gauge - fixings are far more convenient : here we will only consider this kind of gauge - fixing .    on the other hand , the existence of gribov copies is not just a problem since , as gribov himself argued , the natural way to solve such a problem is able to shed considerable light on the infrared ( ir ) region of ym theory .",
    "such solution is to restrict the path - integral only to a region @xmath0 , which is called gribov region , where fp operator is definite - positive @xcite ( detailed reviews are @xcite and @xcite ) so that there are no gribov copies connected to the identity . in order to restrict the path integral to the gribov region",
    ", one can use the gribov - zwanziger ( gz ) approach @xcite .",
    "when the space - time geometry is flat and the topology trivial , this method is able to reproduce the usual perturbation theory encoding , at the same time , the effects related to the elimination of the gribov copies . for instance , it allows the computation of the glueball masses in excellent agreement with the lattice data @xcite . within the same framework , it is also possible to solve the sign problem for the casimir energy and force in the mit - bag model @xcite .",
    "this scheme works very well also at finite - temperature @xcite ( this is also supported by the results in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , at one - loop order , it is possible to compute the vacuum expectation value for the polyakov loop @xcite : these results are in a good agreement with the expected behavior for the deconfinement phase transition @xcite . within the gz approach ,",
    "the non - perturbative correction to the gluon propagator is encoded in the gribov mass which is determined in a self - consistent way by solving the so - called gribov gap equation .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the dependence of gribov mass on the temperature ( as well as on other relevant external parameters ) is very useful to determine the phase - diagram of yang - mills theory .",
    "thus , it is natural to wonder whether or not this approach works so well also in the presence of a background gauge field . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", this analysis is very important as it discloses how strongly the presence of a background field can affect the gribov region and the whole issue of gribov copies .",
    "one of the most relevant applications of the background field method is the computation of the ( vacuum expectation value of the ) polyakov loop @xcite in which the presence of the polyakov loop manifests itself as a constant background field with component along the euclidean time .",
    "another very important non - perturbative phenomenon in which the presence of a background gauge field plays a key role is the ( both abelian and non - abelian ) schwinger effect @xcite .",
    "also in the case of the non - abelian schwinger effect , the relevant background gauge fields are constant @xmath1 which have components both along time and space directions . from the point of view of applications , such an analysis can also be quite relevant in relation with quark - gluon plasma @xcite , color superconductivity in qcd @xcite , astrophysics @xcite , and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the idea of the present paper is precisely to begin the study of the following very relevant and broad question : how the presence of a background field affects the ( appearance of ) gribov copies as well as the gap equation form .",
    "to the best of authors knowledge , such issue has not been deeply analyzed so far .",
    "the background field method ( bfm ) @xcite together with the techniques developed in @xcite are adopted in the present paper .",
    "the results of these references on the gribov problem on curved space strongly suggest ( taking into account that the background metric can play the role of an external field ) that background fields can play a prominent role within the gz approach to ym theory . here",
    "we show that the gribov copies equation is affected directly by the presence of a background field .",
    "in particular , explicit examples will be constructed in which the  relevance \" of the allowed gribov copies decreases as the background field is increased . moreover",
    ", the analysis of the semi - classical gribov gap equation shows that the gribov mass parameter decreases as the size of the background field is increased .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section ,",
    "the gribov problem in the landau - de witt gauge is introduced . in the third section ,",
    "explicit examples of gribov copies in the landau - de witt gauge are studied . in the fourth section ,",
    "the gribov gap equation within a background field is analyzed .",
    "some conclusions and discussions are drawn at the end .",
    "in this section we present an outlook of the gz - approach without background consider background fields , which is the aim of section [ gz - background ] .",
    "the euclidean yang - mills action @xmath2 is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath3 with @xmath4 . in order to take into account the existence of gribov copies due to the this gauge transformation , gribov proposed @xcite to restrict the domain of integration in the path integral to a region in functional space where the eigenvalues of the fp operator @xmath5 are strictly positive .",
    "this region is known as the gribov region @xmath0 , and is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the usual covariant derivative , which depends on @xmath1 .",
    "the boundary of this region is called the first gribov horizon .",
    "later on , zwanziger @xcite implemented the gribov region @xmath0 in euclidean yang - mills theories in the landau gauge , by means of the following action @xmath8 with @xmath9 the euclidean version of the yang - mills action defined in , and where @xmath10 is the so - called horizon function @xmath11 the @xmath12 parameter , known as gribov mass parameter , at a semi - classical level , provides a detailed description of the confinement as the poles of the propagators are imaginary when @xmath13 @xcite , and is determined by a self - consistent horizon condition @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of the space - time dimensions and we understand for @xmath16 functional integral over the fields .",
    "the local version of the horizon function @xmath10 can be achieved through a suitable set of additional fields , which belong to a brst doublet .",
    "then , the local full action reads , @xmath17 where greek indexes run from @xmath18 and latin indexes from @xmath19 .",
    "the fields @xmath20 are a pair of complex conjugate bosonic fields , while @xmath21 are anti - commuting fields .",
    "now , if we consider the relation between the local action @xmath22 and the non - local action @xmath23 @xmath24 [ db ] [ dc ] [ d \\bar{c}]e^{-s_h } = \\int [ da ] [ db ] [ dc ] [ d \\bar{c } ] [ d \\varphi ] d [ \\bar{\\varphi } ] d \\omega ] [ d \\bar{\\omega } ]     e^{-s_{gz}}\\ ] ] and we take the partial derivative of both sides w.r.t @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 0 ) , we obtain @xmath27 which it is precisely the horizon condition . on the other hand , we know that the effective action @xmath28 is obtained through @xmath29 e^{-s_{gz } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 $ ] stands for the integrations over all the fields contained in the action @xmath22 . from this last expression ,",
    "the @xmath12 parameter can also be determined by a self - consistent way by the following gap equation @xmath31 therefore , equation represents the horizon condition formula which will allow us to determine the gribov parameter later on .",
    "as we present a brief introduction in section [ gz - action - section ] of the gz - approach , now we analyze what happens if we take into account a background field .",
    "we consider the @xmath32 yang - mills theory in @xmath33 euclidean dimensions defined in eq .. in the bfm ( see @xcite for more details ) , one introduces a fixed background gauge field configuration @xmath34 through the splitting @xmath35 where @xmath1 and @xmath34 play completely different roles . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath1 represents the quantum fluctuations of the gauge field . on the other hand , the background field @xmath34 plays the role of a classical background , ( this approach is quite relevant in the case of the polyakov loop computation @xcite ) .",
    "the gauge symmetry changes with this background field as @xmath36 although it is not mandatory , in many applications ( such as the already mentioned case of the polyakov loop ) it is convenient to demand that the background gauge field is fixed ( namely , it does not transform under gauge transformations ) .",
    "consequently , it follows the natural requirement @xmath37  in this case , the symmetry transformation in eq .",
    "( [ backgroundsymmetry ] ) can be written as@xmath38 where it has been explicitly taken into account that @xmath34 is not affected by the gauge transformation . at the infinitesimal level , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ,",
    "one recovers the usual infinitesimal gauge transformations with a background gauge field @xcite @xmath41 correspondingly , the landau gauge - fixing condition is also modified . in the presence of a background field , the most convenient gauge - fixing condition takes the form @xmath42\\equiv\\overline{d}_{\\mu}a_{\\mu}^{a}=0,\\ \\ \\overline{d}_{\\mu } = \\partial_{\\mu}\\delta^{ab}+gf^{acb}b_{\\rho}^{c}\\ , \\label{backgroundgaugefixingcondition}\\ ] ] known as the landau - dewitt ( ldw ) gauge fixing condition .",
    "the fp procedure in the presence of a background gauge field leads to the following action ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 denoting the ghost and antighost fields , respectively .",
    "the ldw gauge is actually recovered in the limit @xmath46 , taken at the very end of each computation , and is also plagued by gribov copies , as we will show in the following sections . on the other hand ,",
    "the gz method can be applied to this situation by means a suitable choose of the background field @xmath47 in order to the new fp operator @xmath48 is invertible inside the gribov region @xmath0 . following the lines of @xcite ( and @xcite in the case of a fixed background )",
    ", the gz action under the ldw gauge acquires the form @xmath49 the equation deserves some remarks .",
    "there are two key mathematical requirements ( described in the references @xcite ) necessary in order to write down a local gz action which , in the presence of a background field , can be different with respect to the usual cases .",
    "the first one corresponds to the condition that the fp operator at tree - level must be invertible ( otherwise , the whole procedure to localize the horizon condition would be impossible as non - invertible operators would be involved ) . in the landau gauge",
    "this is obvious as the fp operator at tree - level does not depend at all on @xmath1 and so it reduces to the flat laplacian ( on curved spaces , the story can be quite different @xcite , but we will consider flat spaces only in this manuscript ) . in the cases",
    "in which there is a background field and one adopts the ldw gauge - fixing condition , as we do here , such requirement becomes @xmath50 must be invertible . in other words ,",
    "the above condition is just the statement that the vacuum belongs to the gribov region , such requirement is quite non - trivial in presence of background fields and it is possible to construct examples in which it is not satisfied .",
    "however , in the cases of the background fields considered in this paper ( which are relevant in relation with both the polyakov loop and the schwinger effect computations ) the above condition is satisfied .",
    "the second key requirement ( which does change in the presence of a background field ) is the validity of the _ dellantonio - zwanziger _",
    "theorem @xcite . in the case of the landau gauge",
    ", such a theorem provides the whole gribov - zwanziger idea with solid bases since it shows that one does not loose any relevant information when the restriction to the gribov region is implemented ( since _ every gauge orbit passes inside the gribov horizon _ ) .",
    "remarkably , gribov based its idea of the restriction to the gribov region on this _ local _ version of the _ dellantonio - zwanziger _ theorem . in the presence of a background gauge field",
    ", many of the technical assumptions of @xcite do not hold in general . consequently , the generalization of the _ dellantonio - zwanziger _",
    "theorem appears to be a very difficult problem in non - linear functional analysis ( on which we hope to come back in a future publication ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the local argument by gribov can be repeated step by step in the case of the ldw gauge provided the background field is constant and commutes with itself ( as is the case for the background field considered in the next section ) .",
    "in order to describe the effects of a background field both on the gribov copies equation and on the gap equation avoiding unnecessary technical complications , we will consider the simplest non - trivial background gauge field ( which is relevant in the computation of the polyakov loop @xcite ) : @xmath51 constant background non - abelian gauge fields are very relevant in the analysis of the non - abelian schwinger effect @xcite too .",
    "however , the most interesting configurations considered in these works have both time - like and space - like components turned on at the same time . here",
    "we have chosen the above background gauge field with only euclidean time component since it allows to construct explicitly analytic examples of gribov copies as well as to solve the semi - classical gribov gap equations ( which , quite consistently , shows that the gribov mass decreases with the increase of @xmath52 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the background gauge potentials considered in such works would still allow a complete study of the semi - classical gribov gap equation ( along the lines of the present analysis ) but make extremely difficult to construct explicit examples of gribov copies . as we believe that , when analyzing the gribov problem with an external background field , it is very instructive to analyze both the gribov copies equation and , at the same time , the corresponding gribov gap equation ( which , in a sense , are the two sides of the same coin ) we consider here the background gauge field in eq . .    in this case",

    "<S> the gribov problem in the presence of a background field is analyzed : in particular , we study the gribov copies equation in the landau - de witt gauge as well as the semi - classical gribov gap equation . as background field , we choose the simplest non - trivial one which corresponds to a constant gauge potential with non - vanishing component along the euclidean time direction . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of constant non - abelian background fields is very relevant in relation with ( the computation of ) the polyakov loop but it also appears when one considers the non - abelian schwinger effect . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the gribov copies equation is affected directly by the presence of the background field , constructing an explicit example . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the gribov gap equation shows that the larger the background field , the smaller the gribov mass parameter . </S>",
    "<S> these results strongly suggest that the relevance of the gribov copies ( from the path integral point of view ) decreases as the size of the background field increases . </S>"
