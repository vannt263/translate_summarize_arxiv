    "the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy i  zw  18 is one of the most intriguing objects in the local universe and has fascinated generations of astronomers since its discovery @xcite . with a metallicity between 1/30 and 1/50",
    "z@xmath4 @xcite it holds the record of the second lowest metallicity and lowest helium content measured in a star - forming galaxy @xcite .",
    "the dynamical mass of i  zw  18 measured at a radius of 10-12  is @xmath5 m@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a large amount of gas , corresponding to @xmath6 of the total mass , is detected all around the system , but only @xmath7 of hi is associated with the optical part of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the hi associated to the starburst region forms a compact rapidly rotating disk , and the steep rise of the rotation curve in the inner parts indicates that there is a strong central concentration of mass @xcite .",
    "hi observations have revealed a neutral hydrogen bridge connecting i  zw  18 with a faint companion galaxy ( the so called c component or secondary body ) , which has also been resolved into stars with hst imaging @xcite , and a @xmath013.5 kpc hi tail extending to the south of i  zw  18 main body @xcite .",
    "i  zw  18 shows very blue colors , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite , suggesting the presence of a very young stellar population , with a current star formation rate ( sfr ) much higher than the past mean value @xcite .",
    "all these observational characteristics make i  zw  18 resemble a primeval galaxy in the nearby universe .",
    "in fact , soon after its discovery , the question arose whether i  zw  18 is so metal poor because a ) it started forming stars only recently , so that they havent had much time to pollute metals in the interstellar medium , or b ) because its star formation ( sf ) activity , although occurring over a long period of time , has proceeded at a rate too low for an efficient chemical enrichment , or c ) because strong galactic winds have removed from the system most of the metals .",
    "the nature of i  zw  18 has important cosmological implications .",
    "if indeed some bcds turned out to be young galaxies , their existence would support the view that sf in low - mass systems has been inhibited till the present epoch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the lack of such primordial systems would provide strong constraints on chemical evolution and hydrodynamical models of metal - poor galaxies , e.g. , on their sf regime ( continuous or bursting ? ) or the onset of a galactic wind .    with the advent of the hubble space telescope ( hst )",
    ", it has been possible to resolve the individual stars in i  zw  18 and thus to characterize its evolutionary status . from hst",
    "/ wfpc2 data , @xcite and @xcite argued for a continuous sf over the last 30 - 50 myr .",
    "thanks to a more sophisticated treatment of the same dataset , @xcite were able to go deeper and to detect asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars with ages of at least several hundreds myr .",
    "these results were subsequently confirmed by @xcite through deep hst / nicmos imaging .",
    "later , @xcite failed to detect red giant branch ( rgb ) stars with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board of hst and concluded that the galaxy is at most 500 myr old . however , both @xcite and @xcite , from independent reanalyses of the same acs data set , suggested that i  zw  18 should be older than at least 1 - 2 gyr , since it does appear to contain also rgb stars .    in order to shed light on the situation , we acquired in 2006 new time - series hst / acs photometry to study cepheid stars in i  zw  18 and pin down its distance ( go  10586 , pi aloisi ) . by combining the new data with archival ones",
    ", we both identified the rgb tip ( trgb ) at @xmath10 mag ( @xmath11 mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and detected for the first time a few cepheids whose light curves allowed us to independently derive the distance to @xmath12 1 mpc of accuracy ( d@xmath13 mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of rgb stars in i  zw  18 implies that it has started forming stars at least @xmath01 gyr ago , and possibly at epochs as old as a hubble time , ruling out the possibility that it is a truly primordial galaxy formed recently in the local universe . in this paper",
    "we use synthetic cmds to reconstruct the entire star formation history ( sfh ) within the reachable look - back time and to quantify the stellar mass formed at old , intermediate - age , and young epochs . a qualitative study of the spatial distribution and evolutionary properties of i  zw  18 s resolved stars has been already presented by @xcite .",
    "observations and data reduction have been extensively described in previous papers @xcite . here",
    "we only recall the main aspects .",
    "the data were collected between october 2005 and january 2006 with the acs / wfc in 13 different epochs in f606w ( @xmath0broad v ) , and 12 different epochs in f814w ( @xmath0i ) , for total integration times of @xmath12 27,700 s and @xmath12 26,200 s. the single exposures per epoch per filter were reprocessed with the most up - to - date version of the acs calibration pipeline ( calacs ) .",
    "then , for each filter , we co - added all the exposures into a single image using the software package multidrizzle @xcite , in order to obtain 2 deep images in f606w and f814w , respectively .",
    "a portion of the f606w deep image showing i  zw  18 s main and secondary bodies is shown in fig .",
    "the pixel size of the final resampled drizzled images is 0.035 ( 0.7 times the original acs / wfc pixel size ) .",
    "we also retrieved and combined archival acs / wfc data in f555w ( @xmath0v ) and f814w ( go program 9400 , pi thuan ) , taken in 2003 over a period of 11 days , into two deep master images with total integration times of @xmath12 43,500 s and @xmath12 24,300 s , respectively .",
    "photometry was performed with daophot @xcite in the iraf environment for both the archival and proprietary datasets .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were estimated via a psf - fitting technique .",
    "the psf was created choosing the most isolated and clean stars in the vicinity of i  zw  18 s main and secondary bodies , and was modeled with an analytic moffat function plus additive corrections derived from the residuals of the fit to the psf stars . in order to push the photometry as deep as possible , stars were detected in a sum of the v and i images in each dataset , choosing a detection treshold of 2.4 times the local background level .",
    "this procedure allowed us to recover faint objects with very blue or red colors .",
    "aperture photometry with phot , and then psf - fitting photometry with the daophot / allstar package @xcite , were performed separately on the v and i images at the position of the objects detected in the sum image .",
    "the finding procedure , the aperture photometry , and the psf - fitting photometry were then re - iterated on the subtracted v and i images .",
    "this allowed us to recover additional faint stars showing up only after the subtraction of their brighter neighbours . for each dataset ,",
    "the hst magnitudes were calibrated into the johnson - cousins system using the transformations in @xcite .",
    "the cmd presented in @xcite was obtained by cross - correlating the photometry in the two datasets requiring good matches in position ( within one pixel ) and magnitude ( within 3.5@xmath14 ) , and a daophot sharpness parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the final v and i magnitudes were obtained averaging the magnitudes in the two datasets . in this paper",
    ", we use this matched catalog with @xmath122000 sources to derive the sfh of i  zw  18 .",
    "to account for the highly variable crowding within i  zw  18 , we selected five regions ( a , b , c in the main body , d and e in the secondary body ) .",
    "the corresponding i , v@xmath16i color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the main body , region a",
    "is the most crowded one , and is embedded into a shell of ionized gas , while region c , at the outskirts , is the least crowded one . in the secondary body ,",
    "region e is more crowded than region d. we detect 111 , 481 , 590 , and 548 , and 265 sources in regions a , b , c , d , and e , over an area of @xmath120.06 , 0.66 , 4.83 , 0.17 , and 0.70 kpc@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "however , in region c the majority of stars are concentrated into a smaller area of 0.76 kpc@xmath17 , and thus we will refer to this value hereafter to compute the specific star formation rate ( see table  [ tab_sfr ] ) . the 8.7-day period classical cepheid of @xcite is located in region c , the other two ultra long - period cepheids ( p@xmath0130 d , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are found in regions c and a , while the two long period variables ( p@xmath18100 d ) are in regions b and c.    on the cmds in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have overplotted the padova  94 @xcite stellar tracks for different masses to show the mass ranges ( and thus the look - back times ) sampled in the different regions . in region a , a concentration of bright stars between the 20 and 30 @xmath19 tracks , with ages 7 - 10 myr , and a few stars with mass as low as @xmath0 12 @xmath19 ( @xmath020 myr old ) are detected .",
    "lower mass stars are lost because of the severe photometric incompleteness due to the extreme crowding . in region",
    "b , the look - back time sampled is longer than in region a , with stellar masses as low as 2 @xmath19 ( @xmath0 1 gyr old ) present on the cmd .",
    "however , only in the least crowded region c red giant branch ( rgb ) stars with masses @xmath20 and ages @xmath18 1 gyr are detected .",
    "this also holds for region d in the secondary body , while in the more crowded region e only a few potential rgb stars are observed . from the comparison of the cmds with the theoretical tracks , we also notice the clear presence of an age gradient moving from the most crowded regions to the least crowded ones .",
    "in fact , the bright part of the blue plume ( i@xmath2126 mag ) is significantly more populated in regions a , b and e than in regions c and d , and reaches brighter magnitudes .",
    "this implies more massive stars and younger star formation . for a quantitative derivation of the star formation history ( sfh ) in the different regions we refer to section  [ sec_sfh ]",
    "to evaluate the role of incompleteness and blending in the data , we performed artificial star experiments on the original frames , following the same procedure described in @xcite .",
    "these tests serve to probe observational effects associated with the data reduction process , such as the accuracy of the photometric measurements , the crowding conditions , and the ability of the psf - fitting procedure in resolving partially overlapped sources .",
    "we performed the tests for the individual f555w , f606w , and for the two f814w frames , according to the following procedure .",
    "we divided the frames into grids of cells of chosen width ( 50 pixels ) and randomly added one artificial star per cell at each run .",
    "this procedure prevents the artificial stars to interfere with each other , and avoids to bias the experiments toward an artificial crowding not present in the original frames .",
    "the position of the grid is randomly changed at each run , and after a large number of experiments the stars are uniformly distributed over the frame . in each filter , we assign to the artificial star a random input magnitude between m1 and m2 , with m1 @xmath12 3 mag brighter than the brightest star in the cmd , and m2 @xmath12 3 mag fainter than the faintest star in the cmd . at each run , the frame is re - reduced following the same procedure as for the real data . to account for the fact that in the real data the source detection was performed on a sum of the v@xmath22i frames",
    ", we adopted a smaller treshold than the value of 2.4 adopted for the real data .",
    "the new treshold is derived performing tests on the original frames , and is such that the number of detections in a single frame equals the number of detections in the sum of the v@xmath22i frames with a treshold of 2.4 .",
    "the output photometric catalog is cross - correlated with a sum of the original photometric catalog of real stars and the list of the artificial stars added into the frame .",
    "this prevents cross - correlation of artificial stars in the input list with real stars recovered in the output photometric catalog .",
    "we simulated @xmath0500,000 stars for each filter .",
    "stars with input - output magnitude @xmath18 0.75 were considered lost , because such a difference implies that they fell on a real star of their same luminosity or brighter . for each magnitude bin ,",
    "the completeness of our photometry was computed as the ratio of the number of recovered artificial stars over the number of added ones .    as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] the distribution of the artificial star output minus input magnitude ( @xmath23 m ) in f814w for the aloisi dataset .",
    "we show the different distributions relative to regions a , b , c , d and e selected in i  zw  18 , in order to characterize the photometric error as a function of magnitude and crowding .",
    "the systematic deviation from 0 of the mean @xmath23 m is due to the increasing effect of blending at fainter magnitudes : faint stars tend to be systematically recovered with brighter magnitudes because they happen to overlap with objects of comparable or brighter magnitude .",
    "the photometric errors systematically decrease from the most crowded region a to the least crowded regions c and d. at the same time , the completeness increases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] .",
    "we derived the star formation history ( sfh ) of i  zw  18 through comparison of the observed cmds with synthetic ones .",
    "our procedure consists of two separate steps as described in the following subsections : 1 ) the definition of the so called _ basis functions _ from the combination of the adopted stellar evolution models with the photometric properties of the examined region , and 2 ) the statistical analysis for the identification of the best sfh and relative uncertainties . in order to better characterize the uncertainties intrinsic in the statistical analysis",
    ", we applied two completely independent procedures : the one described by @xcite ( hereafter , the baltimore procedure ) and that described by @xcite ( hereafter , the bologna procedure ) .",
    "the comparison between the two methods provides important information on which features of the sfh are robust and which are instead artifacts due to the adopted minimization approach . on the other hand , quantifying the systematics due to the choice of a particular set of stellar models goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "first , we created a grid of synthetic cmds for episodes with @xmath24 from 6 to 10 , and duration @xmath25 ( hereafter , _ basis functions _ ) .",
    "the choice of logarithmic steps allows us to account for the increasingly lower time resolution in the sfh at larger look - back time .",
    "the basis functions are created following the approach initially described in @xcite , and adopting the last version of the code by @xcite . in brief , the synthetic cmds are produced via monte carlo extractions of ( mass , age ) pairs for an assumed initial mass function ( imf ) , adopting a constant sf from the starting to the ending epoch of each basis function .",
    "here we adopt a salpeter s imf @xcite and zero binary fraction .",
    "each star is placed in the theoretical ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) plane via interpolation on a chosen set of stellar evolutionary tracks ( here , the padova tracks with @xmath28 , * ? ? ?",
    "luminosity and effective temperature are transformed into the acs vegamag f555w , f606w , and f814w filters using the @xcite code .",
    "absolute magnitudes are then converted into apparent ones applying a foreground reddening of @xmath29 from the ned and a distance modulus of @xmath30 mag derived by @xcite . at this point",
    "we apply a completeness test in order to determine whether to retain or to reject the synthetic star , based on the results of the artificial star tests performed in all four images ( f606w and f814w for the aloisi dataset , and f555w and f814w for the thuan dataset , see section  [ sec_artificial ] ) . since we are using the cmd obtained from the cross - correlation of four photometric catalogs ( see section  [ sec_cmd ] ) , we require in the simulations that the synthetic stars pass the test in all four photometric bands .",
    "photometric errors are assigned on the basis of the distribution of the output - minus - input magnitudes of the artificial stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] ) .",
    "these errors take into account the various instrumental and observational effects , as well as systematic uncertainties due to crowding ( i.e. , blend of fainter objects into an apparent brighter one ) .",
    "four magnitudes ( f555w , f606w , plus 2 in f814w ) are associated to each synthetic star . the extraction of ( mass , age ) pairs is stopped when the number of stars populating the synthetic cmd equals a certain fixed number . this number was chosen to be the same for all the basis functions and to guarantee that all the phases potentially sampled in the synthetic cmd ( given the completeness function ) turn out to be well populated . for a direct comparison with the observed cmds in section  [ sec_cmd ] ,",
    "the acs vegamag magnitudes are transformed into the johnson - cousins system and are averaged following the same procedure as for the real data .",
    "the same basis functions are implemented into the baltimore and the bologna procedures .",
    "the sfh was derived through a statistical approach using the code sfhmatrix developed by r. van der marel in baltimore and described in @xcite . in brief , the sfh is inferred finding the weighted combination of basis functions that best reproduce the observed cmd in a @xmath31 sense . to maximize the likelihood , the code considers the density of points on the observed / synthetic cmd , i.e. the hess diagram , rather than the cmd itself .",
    "the best fit is found by solving a non - negative least - squares matrix problem . in sfhmatrix",
    ", the errors on the sfh are calculated creating many realizations of pseudo data sets with properties similar to the real data , and analyzing these pseudo data in the same way as for the real data .",
    "then , the rms scatter in the sfh for a given age is the error bar .",
    "we create the pseudo - data by drawing many monte - carlo realizations from the best - fit sfh that was inferred from the data .",
    "we also derived the sfh using the bologna code ( for details and application see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has many features in common with the baltimore code , but also incorporates some differences in the search of the best synthetic cmd .",
    "similarly to the baltimore algorithm , the sfh is parametrized as a linear combination of quasi simple stellar populations with variable duration ( the basis functions ) , generated from a specific set of stellar models with given metallicity .",
    "the code searches for the linear combination of the basis functions that best matches the observed cmd .",
    "the comparison between the observed and the synthetic cmds is performed through a @xmath31 minimization in strategic regions of the cmd . as the baltimore code , the bologna code considers the hess diagram rather than the cmd itself to perform the minimization .",
    "the sizes and distribution of the bins within the color - magnitude plane can be variable , and are chosen considering some aspects such as the particular cmd shape , the number statistics , the presence of phases where the stellar evolution models are more uncertain , and so on .",
    "differently from the baltimore code , the bologna code employs for the minimization a downhill simplex `` amoeba '' algorithm which is re - started from thousands of initial random positions .",
    "a bootstrap method is used to assess the statistical uncertainty around the best - fit parameters .",
    "the minimization process is repeated for each bootstrapped data set , and the final error bars represent the mean deviation using 1000 bootstraps .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the comparison between the observed cmd selected in the most crowded region a ( left ) and two synthetic cmd realizations drawn from the best - fit sfh with the baltimore code ( middle ) and with the bologna code ( right ) . in both cases ,",
    "when searching for the best - fit solution , we excluded the region below the 60% completeness limit from the @xmath31 minimization .",
    "the reason is that crowding is extreme in region a , implying that the derived completeness curve may become highly uncertain below this limit .",
    "when running the baltimore code , we adopted a constant pixel size of 0.5 in both color and magnitude .",
    "since the stellar tracks fail to reach the reddest supergiants in the observed cmd , we decided to treat the box at @xmath32 , @xmath33 as a single pixel . on the other hand , in the bologna procedure",
    ", the cmd was divided into a regular grid of color - magnitude cells with @xmath34 mag and @xmath35 mag .",
    "the choice of the pixel size , which is driven by the need of minimizing statistical fluctuations without loosing the information in the cmd , remains somewhat subjective .",
    "thus , it is interesting to see how the results change according to the different choices of the grid .",
    "both the baltimore and the bologna codes provided reduced @xmath31 values less than 1 for the best - fit solutions .",
    "the absolute @xmath31 of the fit gives a measure of how well the data are reproduced , but it is often difficult to interpret in practice .",
    "for example , the effective number of degrees of freedom is difficult to estimate when many hess diagram pixels are empty ( such as in region a ) , and do not effectively contribute to constraining the sfh .",
    "we therefore prefer to assess the quality of fit in this paper through other metrics , including data - model comparisons of luminosity functions .    ,",
    "width=340 ]    , width=340 ]    , width=340 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that both the baltimore and the bologna solutions well reproduce the overall morphology of the observed cmd ; however , an inspection of the luminosity functions ( lfs ) in fig .  [ fig4b ] reveals some discrepancies between observations and simulations .",
    "more specifically , the baltimore solution tends to underpredict the blue ( @xmath36 ) counts at @xmath37 , and the red ( @xmath38 ) counts at @xmath39 ; these stars are blue and red supergiants with masses higher than @xmath0 15 @xmath19 and ages less than @xmath010 myr in their post - main sequence ( post - ms ) phase ( we will ignore the shortage of simulated stars at @xmath40 mag , since this region was excluded from the fit and the completeness correction may be uncertain ) .",
    "also the bologna solution tends to underpredict the number of red supergiants , but provides a better match to the bright blue supergiants at @xmath37 .",
    "however , this occurs at the expenses of an excess of fainter blue counts at @xmath41 .",
    "concluding , we notice that both solutions tend to under reproduce the correct ratio of brighter over fainter massive post - ms stars .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4c ] , where we have coded the mass in the simulated cmd , this problem can not be solved with a flatter imf , because the same masses populate at the same time both bright and faint regions in the cmd .",
    "possible explanations are : a ) the completeness behaviour as a function of magnitude is not properly taken into account ; indeed the severe crowding in region a may prevent a robust determination of the completeness function through artificial star tests ; b ) some of the brightest stars in the cmd are in fact blends of two or more stars or unresolved clusters rather than individual stars ; however , as already discussed in @xcite , the colors of the reddest ( @xmath42 ) bright objects in i  zw  18 are incompatible with the cluster hypothesis ; we can also exclude that the large number of bright red stars observed in the cmd is due to reddening within i  zw  18 ; in fact , the largest reddening value estimated by @xcite in the nw component from the h@xmath43/h@xmath44 flux ration amounts to just @xmath45 ; c ) the evolutionary timescales in the brightest post - ms phase for massive stars are underestimated .",
    "the same discrepancy persists if we run some simulations with the new padova parsec stellar models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and bressan et al . ,",
    "private communication ) created with a thorough revision of the major input physics , a new treatment of the opacities consistent with the chemical composition , and a new treatment of the mass loss .",
    "it is possible that models including additional input physics , such as stellar rotation @xcite , could provide a better match to the brightest objects in the cmd , but these models are not available at the moment for a large set of masses at i  zw  18 s metallicity .    the best - fit sfhs obtained with the two different procedures are shown in fig .",
    "for both the baltimore and the bologna code , we show the stellar mass formed and the sfr in the different age intervals .",
    "the results are also summarized in tables  [ tab_sfr ] and [ tab_mass ] .",
    "the values are normalized to a salpeter imf in the mass interval 0.1 to 120 @xmath19 .",
    "the symbol @xmath18 implies that the value is a lower limit .",
    "this is because the look - back time may not be large enough to probe the entire age - range in some regions .",

    "we excluded from the fit the area below the dotted line where the completeness is below 40% .",
    "given the higher density of stars on the cmd than in region a , we adopted here a smaller pixel size of 0.25 in both color and magnitude with the baltimore code , while we chose a pixel size of 0.25 in color and 0.5 in magnitude to run the bologna code .",
    "when running the baltimore code , we treated the box at @xmath32 , @xmath33 as a single pixel ( as for region a ) , and excluded the box at @xmath32 , @xmath50 , where tp - agb stars are located , from the fit .",
    "the reason for this is that the tp - agb phase is not included in the padova  94 tracks that we use in this paper . although more recent padova models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide a much improved treatment of the tp - agb stars , this is still a complex and highly uncertain phase of stellar evolution .",
    "moreover , a significant but unknown fraction of tp - agb stars may be obscured by dust shells @xcite making it difficult to use such stars to constrain the sfh .",
    "on the other hand , the bologna code was run considering the entire cmd down to the 40% completeness limit .",
