    "the problem of finding the maximum flow in a capacitive network is undoubtedly the most known problem in the theory of operational research .",
    "we know since ford and fulkerson that the search of a maximum capacitive flow and that of the minimal cutset in a graph are two sides of the same coin . in the applications ,",
    "the problems can come under a form or another .",
    "thus , this duality allows to choose the formulation which is the most adapted to the mathematical treatment .    in the last decade",
    ", the min - cut formulation has been shown to be a practical and useful tool for image segmentation ( see xiaodong  @xcite or estrada and jepson  @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "it is not surprising since image segmentation is precisely running the scissors along the line of cut .",
    "let us assume for instance that we have a picture of a person and that we want to cut around the face in such a way that the background is rather white along the break : if @xmath5 represents the blackness of the point @xmath6 , then one can try to minimize the `` cost '' @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a curve , which separates the face of the person ( beforehand identified ) from the rest of the photograph .",
    "we give in the present article a probabilistic treatment of this kind of cutset problem : the darkness of the points is given here by a collection of identically distributed random variables , and we want to know to what extent the cost of the minimal cutset is determined by the geometry of the form to be encircled . if we reformulate the problem using the max - flow min - cut duality , we have random capacities on the bonds of @xmath9 and we study the maximum flow that can be carried from the boundary of a given set to infinity . to be more specific , we fix a compact convex subset @xmath10 and study the asymptotic behavior of the maximal flow @xmath2 between @xmath3 and infinity , which is also the cost of a minimal cutset separating @xmath3 from infinity .",
    "we will see that the maximal flow @xmath2 between @xmath3 and infinity is such that @xmath4 almost surely converges to the integral of a deterministic function over the boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "formally , let @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the @xmath14-norm : @xmath15 . as usual",
    ", we denote by @xmath16 the unoriented square lattice .",
    "we say that a map @xmath17 is a flow if @xmath18 holds for each edge @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be a family of positive numbers .",
    "we say that @xmath21 is a capacitive flow from @xmath1 to infinity if it satisfies @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 the set of capacitive flows from @xmath1 to infinity .",
    "the aim is to study the maximal flow from a convex set @xmath1 to infinity , that is ,    @xmath25    when the @xmath20 are given by some collection of independent identically distributed random variables .",
    "the efficiency of methods coming from first passage percolation in studying the maximum flow through a randomly capacitated network was initially pointed out by grimmett and kesten  @xcite : precisely , they gave the asymptotic behavior of the maximum flow through the bottom of a rectangle to its top as an application of their advances in first - passage percolation .",
    "as already mentioned , the point is the use of the max - flow min - cut theorem  @xcite . in the current setting",
    ", we can prove that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the minimum of the quantity @xmath28 , where @xmath8 is taken among the subsets of @xmath29 that separate @xmath1 from infinity , or more precisely that are such that every infinite path in @xmath30 starting from @xmath1 meets @xmath8 .",
    "such a set is called a cutset ( relative to @xmath1 ) . with this definition ,",
    "we can write @xmath31    the cutsets of @xmath32 can be characterized as follows : let @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath36 is isomorphic to @xmath32 .    for each bond @xmath37 of @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) , let us denote by @xmath38 the only subset @xmath39 of @xmath40 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 ) such that the quadrangle @xmath41 is a square in @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is clearly an involution , and it is not difficult to see that @xmath43 is a one - to - one correspondence between the cutsets in @xmath32 and the sets in @xmath44 that contain a closed path surrounding @xmath1 . if @xmath8 is minimal for inclusion , then @xmath45 is just a path surrounding @xmath1 , so the quantity @xmath46 can be interpreted as the length of the path in a first - passage percolation setting on @xmath40 .",
    "this leads us to recall a basic result in first - passage percolation :    assume that @xmath47 is a probability measure on @xmath48 , such that    @xmath49    let @xmath50 and consider the probability measure @xmath51 on @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 , we define @xmath54 , thus the variables @xmath20 are independent identically distributed random variables with common law @xmath47 .    for each @xmath55",

    "we first recall some common notation : @xmath71 is the @xmath72-dimensional normalized hausdorff measure , @xmath73 is the @xmath74-dimensional lebesgue measure , @xmath75 is the usual divergence operator , and @xmath76 is the set of compactly supported @xmath77 vector functions from @xmath62 to @xmath78 . let @xmath10 be a caccioppoli set .",
    "we denote by @xmath79 its boundary and by @xmath80 its reduced boundary , that is constituted by the points @xmath81 , where @xmath79 admits an unique outer normal , which is denoted by @xmath82 .",

    "if we observe the last equality , we can see that the optimal value of a discrete random max - flow problem converges ( after a suitable renormalization ) to the optimum of a deterministic continuous max - flow problem .",
    "in fact , we even have exponential bounds for the fluctuations around @xmath90    indeed , we prove the following theorem .    [ vitesseexpo ] under the assumptions of theorem  [ main ] , it holds that for each @xmath91 , there exist constants @xmath92 , depending on @xmath93 and @xmath47 , such that @xmath94    with the help of menger s theorem , we obtain the following corollaries .",
    "[ avecmenger ] we consider supercritical bernoulli percolation on the square lattice , where the edges are open with probability @xmath95 .",

    "we have@xmath403 where@xmath404 and @xmath405 is the set of flows @xmath406 that satisfy @xmath407 for each @xmath408 and @xmath409  for @xmath410 .    in fact , in the initial paper  @xcite and in most books , @xmath1 and @xmath135 are just singletons .",
    "the reduction to this case is easy . because of the antisymmetry property ,",
    "the contribution of edges inside @xmath1 to @xmath411 is null ; so we neither change the max - flow nor the min - cut if we identify the points that are in @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , the max - flow and the min - cut are not changed either when we identify the points that are in @xmath135 .",

    "a minimal cutset is finite .",
    "it follows that @xmath417",

    "conversely , let @xmath419 be a flow that realizes @xmath420",
    ". we can extend @xmath419 to @xmath421 by putting @xmath422 outside @xmath423 .",

    "@xcite , kesten put the basis of a generalization of first - passage percolation which seems to be the appropriate tool for the problem considered here . basically , he studies the minimal cut between opposite sides of a parallelepiped with @xmath465 as axes .",
    "this allows to define a quantity @xmath466 which is a good candidate for @xmath467 .",
    "later , boivin  @xcite extended some of kesten s results . particularly , he defined a function on the unit sphere of @xmath468 which may be convenient for our purpose .",
    "the condition @xmath469 is coherent with some previous results ; indeed , zhang  @xcite proved that @xmath470 for @xmath471 whereas chayes and chayes  @xcite had proved ( at least in the bernoulli case ) that @xmath472 for @xmath471 using a result of aizenman , chayes , chayes , frhlich and russo  @xcite .",
    "note that thret  @xcite recently proved some results that give an independent proof of this fact .",
