    "in the theory of superconductivity , the quantity which characterizes the nature of pairing is the gap function . more precisely , it is the amplitude for pairing @xmath3 for a cooper pair of electrons in states @xmath4 in a singlet spin configuration .",
    "this quantity is closely related to the energy gap in the single - particle excitation spectrum of a superconductor , and has a direct bearing on many of the experimentally measurable quantities .    as an example , consider the standard bcs @xmath5-wave superconductor @xcite , which has an isotropic gap function which is _ even _ across the fermi surface ( fs ) , non - zero only in a thin shell of width @xmath6 around @xmath7 .",
    "the energy gap @xmath8 is related to the gap function ( 1 ) through the relation @xmath9 and obeys the celebrated gap equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the quasiparticle energy , @xmath12 is the single - particle energy with respect to @xmath7 , and @xmath13 is the effective electron - electron interaction matrix element in the reduced bcs hamiltonian .",
    "the energy gap can be directly observed , for example , through superconductor - normal metal or giaver tunneling .    to understand the significance of the gap function ( [ gapfn ] ) ,",
    "let us examine the behaviour of the bcs wavefunction close to the fs : @xmath14 which can be rewritten as @xmath15 where the product is now over only half of the @xmath16-space ( e.g. @xmath17 and all @xmath18 in 2d ) .",
    "here we have @xmath19 as the singlet cooper pair creation operator at points @xmath16 and @xmath20 in @xmath16-space .",
    "it is clear that @xmath21 is the _ probability amplitude _ of finding no singlet pair with momentum @xmath22 , @xmath23 is that of finding one singlet pair ( of charge @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 that of finding two singlet pairs ( of total charge @xmath26 )",
    ". the bcs state has identical phase relations for various configurations of pair occupancy in @xmath16-space .",
    "that is , when the product in eq .",
    "( [ bcswf ] ) is expanded out , the resulting sum has identical phase for all terms , each term corresponding to different configurations of the @xmath22 occupancy .",
    "superconductivity can thus be thought of as a coherent charge-@xmath24 fluctuating state in @xmath16-space .",
    "since @xmath27 is non - zero only in a thin energy shell around the fs , the coherent @xmath24 charge fluctuation is concentrated around the fs .",
    "( note that this coherence in @xmath16-space results in phase coherence among the cooper pairs in real space also ) .",
    "away from the shell , we either have a completely filled band ( inside the fs ) or a completely empty band ( outside the fs ) and hence no charge fluctuations .",
    "the gap function ( [ gapfn ] ) , for the bcs wavefunction ( [ bcswf ] ) , reduces to @xmath28 and is thus a measure of coherent charge fluctuations in @xmath16-space .    in the context of the high-@xmath0 cuprates",
    ", it is generally believed that the gap function is not of simple bcs type ( @xmath5-wave and even across @xmath29 ) .",
    "some of the recent experiments have suggested that the gap is highly anisotropic , possibly with the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "@xcite yet another proposal is that of odd - gap pairing , which is a favoured mode of pairing in the presence of a strong , purely repulsive interaction .",
    "@xcite a recent proposal in the context of the interlayer tunneling mechanism is that of anisotropic @xmath5-wave pairing , which has deep minima but no actual nodes on the fs .",
    "@xcite however , in spite of intense activity , both on theoretical and experimental sides , the issue of the symmetry of the gap function still remains unresolved .",
    "the importance of this issue can not be overestimated , since the gap function is a quantity which , on the one hand , has direct experimental consequences , and on the other , may offer a unique signature pointing to the right kind of mechanism for high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the behaviour of @xmath27 using exact diagonalization , especially with reference to its nodal structure .",
    "we would like to find out the most likely pairing symmetries , both angular and radial , for clusters consisting of single or coupled chains and planes .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the @xmath2 symmetry and odd - gap pairing . in",
    "what follows , we first present a brief summary of the various proposed gap functions , especially @xmath2 and odd - gap pairing ( section ii ) .",
    "we then present our numerical procedure in section iii and the results in section iv .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "in order to see , on general grounds , why gap functions with zeros are preferable as candidates for pairing in high-@xmath0 superconductors , let us consider the one - band large-@xmath30 hubbard model or the @xmath1 model .",
    "these models are believed to contain the essential low - energy physics of high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "let us begin by noting that in the large-@xmath30 hubbard model , the on - site pairing amplitude @xmath31 is diminished considerably on account of the restriction on double occupancy . in the @xmath1 model , of course , double occupancy is completely projected out .",
    "thus @xmath32 , which reduces , in @xmath16-space , to @xmath33 where we have used the pairing condition @xmath34 .",
    "this is a constraint on the gap function , arising from a strong real - space repulsion , and implies the presence of zeros in the gap function .    the constraint , however , is a global constraint , and can be satisfied in several ways .",
    "one possibility is that of odd - gap pairing , in which case the gap function vanishes on the _ entire _ fermi surface , and changes sign across the fs .",
    "yet another possibility is that of a simple @xmath2 superconductor on a 2d square lattice , for which the gap function vanishes along the lines @xmath35 which intersect the fs at exactly four points .",
    "we give below a brief account of these two and some of the other proposed pairing states .",
    "the possibility of odd - gap pairing , in the presence of a dominantly repulsive interaction , was anticipated by cohen @xcite many years ago . the case for odd - gap pairing , in the context of high-@xmath0 superconductivity , was put forward by mila and abrahams @xcite , within the framework of the weak coupling bcs theory . they have shown that an _ even _ solution to the bcs gap equation ( [ gapeq ] ) exists only so long as the effective electron - electron interaction is dominantly attractive , albeit weak .",
    "this is the case with the standard bcs model of conventional superconductivity , where the weak attraction arises due to electron - phonon coupling . in the presence of a repulsive interaction , however , such a solution ceases to exist when the repulsive part of the interaction starts dominating , and an unusual solution is shown to exist which is _ odd _ across the fs .",
    "for example , in the toy models considered in @xcite as well as @xcite , the energy gap is proportional to @xmath36 , which is clearly odd across the fs .",
    "moreover , an odd gap is independent of the _ magnitude _ of the repulsion , provided that it is the repulsion which dominates .",
    "this condition is met in the large-@xmath30 hubbard model , and odd - gap pairing is thus a candidate for pairing in the high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "mila and abrahams have further shown that certain key features of the tunneling density of states in the cuprates , such as the temperature - insensitive peak , can be naturally explained on the basis of odd - gap pairing .",
    "this feature is in contrast with @xmath5-wave as well as @xmath2 pairing , in which the peak shifts towards @xmath7 as @xmath37 .",
    "anderson @xcite has also pointed out in the context of the rvb theory that the gap function vanishes on , and changes sign across , the fs .",
    "for example , in the rvb mean field theory at half filling , @xcite the gap function is constant and changes sign across the pseudo fs defined by @xmath38 and satisfies the constraint ( [ gapsum ] ) .",
    "for the doped case , however , the analysis is difficult and anderson did not provide any argument as to why the gap should vanish on the fs away from half - filling .",
    "@xcite in the latter case , it is argued that strong correlations in real space lead to a suppression of coherent charge fluctuations close to the fs , @xcite in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ bcswf ] ) , as follows .",
    "strongly correlated electrons in 1d , described by a large-@xmath30 hubbard model , have certain unique features close to the fs .",
    "it is well known that in the 1d hubbard model there is singular forward scattering between two electrons with opposite spins close to the fs .",
    "this leads to a finite phase shift @xcite at the fs and the consequent failure of the fermi liquid theory , resulting in the vanishing of the discontinuity in @xmath39 at the fs ( luttinger liquid behaviour ) .",
    "it also implies an effective hard - core repulsive pseudopotential between electrons with opposite spins close to the fs .",
    "thus no two electrons close to the fs , with opposite spins , can have the same momentum , thereby making @xmath16-points close to the fs essentially singly occupied .",
    "coherent pair fluctuations are thus unlikely to develop on or very close to the fs , but are not forbidden away from the fs .",
    "it is therefore likely that the line of zeros of @xmath27 implied by the global constraint ( eq .",
    "( [ gapsum ] ) ) will coincide with the fs .    whether these arguments carry over to 2d or not is still unclear .",
    "it is believed that if the constraint of no double occupancy in real space leads to singular forward scattering and the consequent failure of fermi liquid theory in 2d ( in the spirit of anderson s tomographic luttinger liquid picture @xcite ) , a gap function which vanishes on the entire fs is a natural candidate for pairing .",
    "odd - gap pairing has so far found very feeble experimental support",
    ". however , a very recent work @xcite shows arpes data in bi2212 cuprates in which the gap _ does not vanish _ along @xmath40 , but vanishes on either side of this line .",
    "this can be interpreted as a possible indication that the nodal lines in the gap coincide with the fs .",
    "the @xmath2 paired state is characterised by a gap function of the form @xmath41 support to @xmath2 pairing comes from numerous sources .",
    "theoretical analysis of motion of holes in an antiferromagnetic background shows that exchange of spin fluctuations can induce singlet pairing of @xmath2 symmetry , for which hole - hole interaction is attractive .",
    "@xcite although antiferromagnetic fluctuations are rather subdued in the doped case in comparison with half - filling , it is reasonable to expect @xmath2 pairing as a possibility .    on the experimental side ,",
    "numerous experiments have been performed recently , which seem to support @xmath2 pairing .",
    "london penetration depth data from hardy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows a low - temperature linear temperature dependence which is in agreement with a @xmath2 superconductor , and very much in contrast with the bcs @xmath5-wave case ( which shows an exponential behaviour ) .",
    "an experimental result strongly supporting @xmath2 pairing is the @xmath42 variation of cu nmr relaxation rate @xcite .",
    "arpes measurements on bi2212 compunds by shen _",
    "_ @xcite indicate lines of zeros compatible with a @xmath2 state , and incompatible with an extended-@xmath5 state , although these measurements are unable to rule out pairings such as @xmath43 or an anisotropic @xmath5-wave ( next section ) .",
    "certain other experiments , which support @xmath2 pairing , but can not rule out the possibility of other kinds of pairing include squid experiments on ybco @xcite and electronic raman scattering measurements on bi2212 compounds .",
    "@xcite    on the numerical side , studies in favour @xmath2 pairing include an exact diagonalization study of possible pairing symmetries by riera and young @xcite ( on which we comment in the next section ) . dagotto and riera @xcite",
    "find bound hole pairs with @xmath2 symmetry near half - filling and on the verge of phase separation , although the value of @xmath44 is rather too large in comparison with the experimentally relevant parameter range @xmath45 .",
    "another notable work @xcite calculates an anomalous green s function for one and two holes using lanczos technique , and finds signals of @xmath2 pairing over a wide range of parameter @xmath46 ( not specified ) .      a variational monte carlo study by li _",
    "@xcite supports @xmath43 symmetry rather than a pure @xmath2 .",
    "this calculation compares rvb variational states with extended-@xmath5 , @xmath2 , and mixed states @xmath47 and @xmath43 symmetries .",
    "the authors show that the mixed states are energetically preferred over pure @xmath5 or @xmath2 states , and that the @xmath43 state overcomes finite - size effects at a lattice size smaller than that required by the @xmath2 state .",
    "the authors also argue that the knight shift data in the ybco cuprates is better explained by @xmath43 rather than pure @xmath2 pairing .",
    "wheatley @xcite has also analyzed the stability of various mixed states involving @xmath2 .",
    "chakravarty _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently proposed an anisotropic @xmath5-wave pairing state based on the interlayer tunneling mechanism @xcite .",
    "this state has no actual nodes on the fs although deep minima occur , and the gap is highly anisotropic . since arpes results , such as @xcite , are unable to detect the sign of the gap function ( as well as the presence of a node unambiguously owing to the current energy resolution ) , they are consistent with such an anisotropic @xmath5-wave pairing as well .",
    "interlayer tunneling is also responsible for a temperature - dependent anisotropy in the gap , as shown by muthukumar and sardar @xcite , which is incompatible with the @xmath2 scenario .",
    "such a temperature - dependent anisotropy has been observed in the arpes data by ma et al .",
    "in our exact diagonalization computation , since we have chosen to work in a number - conserving basis , it is not possible to evaluate @xmath27 directly .",
    "@xcite we thus define a correlation function @xmath48 as @xmath49 where the average @xmath50 is the expectation value in the ground - state of a finite cluster , obtained via exact diagonalization .",
    "this quantity is clearly a measure of coherent pair fluctuations between states @xmath22 and @xmath51 in the ground state .",
    "we find the gap function @xmath27 by diagonalizing this two particle reduced density matrix ( [ dm ] ) , which has the eigenfunction decomposition @xmath52 here , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the @xmath55 th eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the @xmath56 matrix @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 is the number of points in the brillouin zone and the index @xmath55 orders @xmath59 s as @xmath60 .",
    "superconducting odlro is signalled @xcite by a macroscopic separation of the largest eigen value @xmath61 from the next one @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 . the required gap function @xmath27 is the eigenvector @xmath64 corresponding the largest eigen value @xmath61 , which is the cooper pair state with least energy for which condensation will take place , whereas the other eigenvectors represent the various excited states of the cooper pair .",
    "for example , for the standard bcs ground state , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , for @xmath68 .",
    "a similar procedure was adopted by riera and young @xcite in the context of the @xmath1 model with the three - site term .",
    "however , the authors argue that from the expression ( [ dm ] ) translated into real space , @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 creates a spin - singlet pair of electrons at sites @xmath71 ) , one should retain only those terms which have all the four indices @xmath72 distinct , since it is only these terms which correspond to true pairing terms , rather than mere charge and spin correlations .",
    "the authors _ post facto _ justify this procedure on the basis that the @xmath2 symmetry starts dominating very close to where the two - hole binding energy becomes negative , as a function of @xmath73 .",
    "we do not agree with this argument , since there is no clear cut way to justify such a removal _ a priori _ , in our calculation , since we are calculating a quantity in @xmath16-space ; eq .",
    "( [ dmrs ] ) then dictates that all terms be retained in the fourier transform .",
    "indeed , such removal in the @xmath74 case leads to an incorrect symmetry , whereas the gap function is known to be of a simple bcs type , _",
    "i. e. _ an even function across the fs ( with an @xmath5-wave symmetry in 2d ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig . 1 in which we plot the gap function corresponding to the highest eigenvalue for an 8-site hubbard chain with @xmath75 , with and without following this removal of terms . without the removal of terms ,",
    "we see the expected behaviour , whereas with the removal , we observe a sign change across @xmath76 . on a @xmath77 hubbard plane at @xmath75 , with the removal of terms ,",
    "we have observed a double sign change across the fs , indicating two nodal lines encircling the fs on either side , whereas without such removal , we see the expected bcs - like symmetry .",
    "we shall thus present results _ without _ the removal of these `` on - site '' terms . note that with removal , we indeed obtain similar results as riera and young .",
    "@xcite we would also like to point out that unlike their work , the focus of our work is the nodes in the gap function .",
    "we shall refer to the gap function corresponding to the highest eigenvalue of the density matrix ( [ dm ] ) as the `` topmost '' gap function , and the term eigenspectrum will be used to refer to the eigenvalue spectrum of the density matrix .",
    "the clusters used for these calculations are single - layer clusters of 8 ( hubbard ) and 16 ( @xmath1 ) sites , and clusters with two 8-site @xmath1 layers coupled by an interlayer term of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 are layer indices (= 1,2 ) , @xmath80 is the site index within a layer and @xmath81 is the spin label .",
    "we first present the gap function for the 1d clusters .",
    "2 displays the topmost gap function for @xmath82 at various fillings .",
    "a clear change of sign is visible across the corresponding fermi point ( @xmath83 at half filling , @xmath84 for 2 and 4 holes ) , indicating the presence of a node near @xmath76 .",
    "similar behaviour is observed for all @xmath85 , and over a range of fillings ( 0 , 2 , 4 and 6 holes ) .",
    "the results for a 16-site @xmath1 chain are presented in fig . 3 and 4 , and are representative of the parameter range @xmath86 .",
    "3 presents eigenspectrum of the density matrix for various cases : half - filling at @xmath87 ( 1 ) , 2 holes at @xmath88 ( 2)-(5 ) .",
    "all these spectra display a prominant , well - separated largest eigenvalue , indicating the possibility of odlro ( as far as a finite size calculation can reveal ) .",
    "for comparison , we have also plotted the eigenspectrum for a antiparallel triplet cooper pair density matrix in fig . 3 ( 6 ) for @xmath89 , 2 holes , which does not show a well - separated eigenvalue .",
    "4 displays the topmost gap function at half - filling and 2 holes , where a clear sign change across @xmath76 indicates a node near @xmath76 .    finally , fig .",
    "5 plots the topmost gap function for a _ single _ 8-site chain in a system of two 8-site @xmath1 chains coupled by an interlayer coupling term ( [ ilc ] ) , for 2 holes with @xmath87 and @xmath90 .",
    "we see again a clear node near @xmath91 very similar to the case of a single 16-site @xmath1 chain .",
    "we now turn to the more interesting case of 2d clusters .",

    ", we shall display the numerical values of the coefficients of the corresponding eigenvector ( of the density matrix ( [ dm ] ) ) at all @xmath16-points in the brillouin zone .",
    "the fs ( and the nodal lines of @xmath2 , wherever required ) will be indicated by dashed lines .",
    "we first discuss the characteristics of the eigenspectra . in all the cases",
    "presented , the eigenspectrum displays a separated largest eigenvalue , although not as well - separated as in the 1d case .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) are eigenspectra for 2 holes , respectively for a @xmath77 hubbard cluster with @xmath82 , @xmath92 @xmath1 plane with @xmath87 and coupled @xmath77 @xmath1 planes with @xmath96 .",
    "the most striking feature of these results is the close interplay between the odd - pairing and the @xmath2 gap functions .",
    "the odd - paired state is the topmost for all the three clusters , with the next dominant state as the @xmath2 state on @xmath92 and coupled @xmath77 clusters . for the @xmath77 hubbard cluster with 2 holes , however , the @xmath2 state is quite low down in the eigenspectrum .",
    "these two states , for a @xmath92 plane , are displayed in fig .",
    "the overall picture that emerges out of this study is as follows . in 1d and 2d",
    ", the gap function shows the presence of a node near or at @xmath76 , indicating an odd - paired behaviour . the @xmath2 state",
    "is often seen as the next dominant state .",
    "quite clearly , the numerical results seem to indicate the presence of a nodal `` surface '' ( gns ) in the gap function closely following the fs . recall that in the rvb mean - field theory at half - filling , the gns coincides with the fs in 2d (",
    "also seen in our numerical results ( not shown ) ) .",
    "it may be argued that as doping increases from zero , the fs shrinks , dragging part of the gns with it .",
    "@xcite the non - overlap of the gns with the fs in some parts in the bz is possibly caused due to the enhancement of the interlayer pair tunneling matrix element @xmath97 in those directions in @xmath98-space .",
    "for example , as emphasized by chakravarty _",
    "@xcite , @xmath97 is largest in the @xmath99 and @xmath100 directions which enhances pairing in those regions of the fs by keeping the gns away .",
    "incorporates this idea as well as the eight nodal points of the recent arpes data @xcite .",
    "based on the present numerical work , we believe that it may be possible to construct novel scenarios where such a nodal surface is also consistent with @xmath2 pairing .",
    "this and such other aspects are discussed elsewhere .",
    "@xcite    the major handicap of any exact diagonalization calculation is the cluster size restriction .",
    "it is not possible for us to rule out finite size effects , but the features we have observed are consistent within the sizes and geometries considered .",
    "it is indeed possible that finite size effects are more serious when symmetry issues are concerned , in comparison with , for example , the finite size effects in simple spin , charge or pairing correlation functions .",
    "@xcite    note that we do not interpret the present results as indicative of the presence of superconducting odlro in purely 2d systems .",
    "however , it does indicate that these pairing correlations show an odd - paired behaviour across the fs , a feature which seems to persist even in the presence of an interlayer coupling term .",
    "to summarise , we have investigated the behaviour of the gap function @xmath27 across the fermi surface in the doped @xmath1 and large-@xmath30 hubbard clusters in one and two dimensions , with special reference to odd - gap and @xmath2 pairing . for this purpose , we diagonalize a reduced two - particle ( cooper pair ) density matrix computed through exact diagonalization . the largest eigenvalue of this density matrix is well - separated from the rest , indicating the possibility of odlro .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector , the cooper pair wavefunction with least energy , reflects the symmetry of the gap function @xmath27 .",
    "the results on 8- and 16-site single or coupled chains and planes clearly indicate a change of sign of @xmath27 across @xmath76 , indicating the presence of a node close to the entire fs , a signature of odd - pairing behaviour .",
    "this state , on single and coupled planes , in addtion , is isotropic , indicating an angular symmetry which is of the @xmath5-wave type .",

    "<S> one of the most debated issues related to high-@xmath0 superconductivity is the symmetry of the cooper pair or the gap function . in this report , we present numerical results regarding the gap function in strongly correlated electron systems using @xmath1 and hubbard models in one and two dimensions . to this end , we use exact diagonalization to study the ground states of 8- and 16-site clusters consisting of single or coupled layers . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a reduced two - particle density matrix in momentum space which is a measure of the gap function . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyze the eigenvectors of this density matrix , which display the possible cooper pair symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue indicates a vanishing gap on the fermi surface ( which is in favour of odd - gap pairing ) although @xmath2 symmetry is seen to be a very close contestant in many of the cases . </S>"
