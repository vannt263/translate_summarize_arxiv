    "this is certainly the case when @xmath91 is nonzero . since also @xmath92 for the paramagnetic state , however , it is necessary to check whether @xmath64 is finite .",

    "only the solution that converges to @xmath45 with @xmath95 is stable against longitudinal fluctuations as is easily seen by expanding the free energy for small q. the free energy of this stable paramagnetic state is always zero .",

    "we remark that this paramagnetic state at @xmath98 is in fact simply a frozen state with all the spins taking the value zero ( and not a phase where all the spins take all possible values with the same probability ) .",
    "finally , the stability of the replica symmetric retrieval solution against replica - symmetry breaking is determined by the replicon eigenvalue @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is given by eq .",
    "( [ ta3 ] ) . in the limit @xmath101 , @xmath100 becomes a step function so that the argument of the integration over @xmath102 is proportional to the square of the delta function .",
    "therefore the replicon eigenvalue for the retrieval solution at @xmath98 is always negative and , hence , replica symmetry is broken .",
    "for the paramagnetic solution that we have discussed before we find that the replicon eigenvalue @xmath103 so that this state is also stable against transverse fluctuations .    at this point a couple of remarks",
    "are in order .",
    "first , we note that the fixed - point equations and , hence , also the @xmath104 phase diagram are precisely the same as those obtained from an exact dynamical approach ( see @xcite eqs .",
    "( 23)-(25 ) and fig .",
    "2 ) after requiring that the evolution of the distribution of the local field becomes stationary at a certain time @xmath32 .",
    "this requirement has the consequence that most of the discrete noise caused by the feedback in the retrieval dynamics is neglected .",
    "it would mean that for these models a replica - symmetric mean - field theory treatment corresponds to a specific simplification of the structure of the noise  only the gaussian part plus the discrete noise coming from the last time step  induced by the non - condensed patterns .",
    "this is also related to the so called self - consistent signal - to - noise - ratio analysis introduced in @xcite . however ,",
    "more work is needed , also on other models , to put such a type of conjecture on a firm basis .",
    "second , it is interesting to compare the phase diagram figure [ fig : q3t0retr ] with the one for the extremely diluted _ asymmetric _ architecture @xcite .",
    "the essential difference is that the @xmath62-ising - like region is much more extended here .",
    "the rest of the diagram has , in fact , a similar shape but it is tilted because of this ising - like region towards greater @xmath45-values ( compare @xcite fig .  1 ) .",
    "next we consider the @xmath6 network at non - zero temperatures .",
    "the results are presented in figures [ fig : q3tn0b ] and [ fig : q3tn0 t ] . from @xmath105",
    "onwards the retrieval state appears continuously at the whole boundary .",
    "furthermore , the retrieval state is the global minimum of the free energy in a growing region covering the whole retrieval region of the phase diagram as the temperature increases to @xmath106 . for @xmath107 the lower branch of",
    "the retrieval boundary ends in zero such that for higher temperatures we apparently have no retrieval for small values of @xmath30 . for @xmath108 and @xmath109 ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath110 .",
    "finally , the replica symmetry solution is no longer unstable in the whole retrieval region . calculating the replicon eigenvalue ( [ replinew ] ) leading to the de almeida - thouless ( at ) line ( dashed - dotted curve in figures [ fig : q3tn0b ] and [ fig : q3tn0 t ] ) we find a growing region of stability in the phase diagram below this at - line .    in order to give a more complete idea of these results we present the capacity - temperature phase diagrams in figure [ fig : q3tn0 t ] .",
    "we immediately notice that for higher temperatures we get a higher critical capacity , in other words the upper branch of the retrieval boundary shows some strong re - entrant behaviour .",
    "this is not surprising since this branch lies completely in the region where replica symmetry is broken , in contrast with the fully - connected ( symmetric ) model @xcite .",
    "it is common knowledge , at least for @xmath4 @xcite , that re - entrance is due to the use of the replica - symmetric approximation .",
    "it is also conjectured there that a full replica symmetry breaking solution might be a horizontal line above this upper branch of the retrieval boundary starting from the high temperature point . validating this conjecture by numerical simulations or doing a one step replica symmetry breaking calculation in order to see whether such results lie indeed closer to this horizontal line are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of a network consisting of neurons that are able to take on the zero  state ( @xmath111 ) are significantly different from those of a network in which this state is forbidden for the neurons .",
    "indeed , for the even @xmath0 models a paramagnetic phase at zero temperature has to be absent precisely because the spins can not take the value zero and , hence , @xmath91 can not be zero physically . for high temperatures , of course",
    ", @xmath91 can be zero and such phase does exist .",
    "this is similar to the asymmetric diluted architecture @xcite and the fully connected architecture @xcite .",

    "the result is indicated in figure [ fig : q4 ] by a full line expressing the fact that the retrieval state appears continuously everywhere .",
    "the triangular region in figure [ fig : q4 ] bordered by the thin long - dashed curve indicates the existence of two retrieval states with different free energies .",
    "both stable retrieval states have the same free energies at the thick long - dashed curves . in order to get an idea about the relevant @xmath45 and m - values for this case",
    ", we note that for @xmath122 @xmath123 again , these results are valid independent of the architecture ( compare @xcite ) .    concerning the spin - glass states we have to solve the equations ( [ q4mt0])-([q4ct0 ] ) for @xmath84 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that a spin - glass phase exists in the whole region of the phase diagram . by looking at the free energy expression ( [ fet0 ] )",
    "we find that it is always energetically unfavourable versus the retrieval state ( only versus the one with the lower free energy in case there are two ) .",
    "furthermore , the retrieval state is unstable against replica symmetry breaking .    comparing the phase diagram of the @xmath7 model with that of the asymmetrically diluted model",
