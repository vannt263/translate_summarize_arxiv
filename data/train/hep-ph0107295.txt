    "the pion transition form factor plays a crucial role in testing qcd predictions for exclusive processes .",
    "it appears in the amplitude that relates two , in general virtual , photons with the lightest hadron , the pion , @xmath8 .",
    "historically , this process attracted much interest since the axial anomaly @xcite fixes the value of the form factor when both virtualities of the photons are zero ( @xmath9 ) . for large virtualities of the photons ( or at least for one of them )",
    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is applicable @xcite .",
    "a specific feature of this process is that the leading - order ( lo ) prediction is zeroth order in the qcd coupling constant , and one expects that pqcd for this process may work at accessible values of spacelike photon virtualities @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the most favorable situation is when one of the photons is real ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the framework for analyzing exclusive processes at large - momentum transfer within the context of pqcd was initiated and developed in the late seventies @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated to all orders in perturbation theory that exclusive amplitudes at large - momentum transfer factorize into a convolution of a process - dependent and perturbatively calculable hard - scattering amplitude , with a process - independent distribution amplitude ( da ) , one for each hadron involved in the amplitude . whereas the da is intrinsically nonperturbative and its form",
    "is determined by some nonperturbative methods , the da evolution is subject to a perturbative treatment . in the standard hard - scattering approach ( shsa ) ,",
    "a hadron is regarded as consisting only of valence fock states , transverse quark momenta are neglected ( collinear approximation ) as well as quark masses .",
    "although the lo predictions in the shsa ( as well as in the modified hard - scattering approach ( mhsa ) in which the collinear approximation is abandoned @xcite ) have been obtained for many exclusive processes , only a few processes have been analyzed at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) : the pion electromagnetic form factor @xcite , the pion transition form factor @xcite ( and @xcite in the mhsa ) , and the process @xmath11",
    "( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , unlike in qed , one can not rely upon the lo predictions in pqcd ( the expansion parameter , i.e. , the running coupling constant is rather large at current energies ) , and that higher - order corrections are important .",
    "the size of the nlo correction as well as the size of the expansion parameter , i.e. the qcd running coupling constant , can serve as sensible indicators of the convergence of the expansion .",
    "however , as the truncation of the perturbative expansion at any finite order causes the residual dependence of the prediction on the choice of the renormalization scale and scheme , these choices introduce an ambiguity in the interpretation of the finite - order perturbative prediction . in general , including higher - order corrections has a stabilizing effect ( see @xcite , for illustration ) reducing the dependence of the predictions on the schemes and scales ( since the all - order prediction is independent of the scheme and scale choice ) .",
    "however , to asses the convergence of the perturbative expansion , it is necessary not only to extend the calculation beyond the lo ( which is a very demanding task in many cases ) , but also to optimize the choices of the scale and scheme according to some sensible criteria .    in the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm )",
    "procedure @xcite , all vacuum - polarization effects from the qcd @xmath14-function are resummed into the running coupling constant . since the coefficients",
    "@xmath15 are functions of @xmath0 ( number of flavors ) , according to blm procedure , the renormalization scale best suited to a particular process in a given order can be , in practice , determined by computing vacuum - polarization insertions in the diagrams of that order , and by setting the scale demanding that @xmath0-proportional terms should vanish .",
    "the renormalization scales in the blm method are physical in the sense that they reflect the mean virtuality of the gluon propagators and the important advantage of this method is `` pre - summing '' the large ( @xmath16)@xmath17 terms , i.e. , the infrared renormalons associated with the coupling constant renormalization ( @xcite and references therein ) .    the optimization of the renormalization scale and scheme for exclusive processes by employing the blm scale fixing was elaborated in ref .",
    "it was stated that exclusive processes are especially sensitive to the choice of the renormalization scale for the underlying hard - scattering amplitude and since each external momentum entering an exclusive reaction is partitioned among many propagators of the underlying hard - scattering amplitude , the physical scales that control these processes are inevitably much softer than the overall momentum transfer .",
    "the blm method was applied to the pion electromagnetic form factor and the @xmath18 process . for the pion transition form factor , the size of the blm scale",
    "was only assumed ( taken the same as for the pion electromagnetic form factor ) . since the lo prediction for the pion transition form factor is zeroth order in the qcd coupling constant , the nlo corrections @xcite represent leading qcd corrections and the vacuum polarization contributions appearing at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) are necessary for determining the blm scale for this process .",
    "the purpose of this work is to determine the blm scale for the pion transition form factor , i.e. , for the @xmath19 process .",
    "although , the structure of the process is simple , the calculation of higher - order corrections to the hard - scattering amplitude is complicated by the @xmath1 ambiguity , which appears when using dimensional regularization . in our calculation",
    "we use dimensional regularization in @xmath20 dimensions to regularize both ultraviolet ( uv ) and collinear singularities .",
    "we have obtained the lo , nlo , and @xmath0-proportional nnlo terms for the hard - scattering amplitude using the feynman gauge and modified minimal - subtraction scheme ( @xmath21 ) for which a suitable compact form has been adopted . in order to correctly subtract the collinear singularities and also to verify the right choice of the @xmath1 prescription , we have also determined the lo , nlo , and @xmath0-proportional nnlo terms of the perturbatively calculable ( evolutional ) part of the distribution amplitude .",
    "the @xmath1 ambiguity present in the calculation of the hard - scattering part has been resolved by combining and matching the results for the hard - scattering amplitude with the results for the distribution amplitude part .",
    "the proper cancellation of singularities has been established and the @xmath1 problem has been resolved using both the so - called naive-@xmath1 @xcite and the t hooft - veltman ( hv ) schemes @xcite . it has been demonstrated that the prediction for the pion transition form factor is independent of the factorization scale @xmath2 at every order in strong coupling constant . finally , we have been able to justify the natural choice @xmath3 for the factorization scale and to determine the renormalization scale using the blm scale setting method .",

    "<S> the nlo brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) scale for the pion transition form factor has been determined . to achieve that , a consistent calculation up to @xmath0-proportional nnlo contributions to both the hard - scattering amplitude and the perturbatively calculable part of the pion distribution amplitude has been performed . by combining and matching the results obtained for these two amplitudes , </S>",
    "<S> a proper cancellation of collinear singularities has been established and the @xmath1 ambiguity problem ( related to the use of the dimensional regularization method ) has been resolved by using the naive-@xmath1 as well as the t hooft - veltman ( hv ) schemes . it has been demonstrated that the prediction for the pion transition form factor is independent of the factorization scale @xmath2 at every order in the strong coupling constant , making it possible to use the simplest choice @xmath3 at the intermediate steps of the calculation . assuming the pion asymptotic distribution amplitude and working in the @xmath4 scheme , we have found the blm scale to be @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> based on the same distribution , the complete nlo prediction for the pion transition form factor has been calculated in the @xmath6 definition of the qcd coupling renormalized at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is in good agreement with the presently available experimental data . </S>"
