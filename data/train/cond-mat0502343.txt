    "decay of supercurrent in one - dimensional ( 1d ) superfluids and superconductors is a problem of longstanding interest . in 1967 , little @xcite discussed the role of `` large '' thermal fluctuations in thin superconducting wires and observed that if , as a result of such a fluctuation , the order parameter @xmath0 vanishes at some point , the phase of @xmath0 can unwind , leading to a nonzero resistance .",
    "such processes became known as thermally - activated phase slips ( taps ) .",
    "using thermodynamic arguments , little had pointed out that at low temperatures the rate of these processes is exponentially small .",
    "a more detailed theory of taps , based on the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations , was constructed in subsequent works @xcite and became known as the lamh theory . at first sight",
    ", it may appear that the lamh theory is essentially an application of the conventional droplet model to the specific case of a superconducting wire . in this approach",
    ", one identifies a critical droplet as a saddle point solution to the classical equations of motion ( in our case , the gl equation ) .",
    "dynamics along the negative mode of this saddle point is supposed to mediate a transition between states that differ by one unit of the winding number .    on a closer inspection",
    ", however , one notices that the order parameter does not vanish on the lamh saddle point , except for initial states with exactly zero current .",
    "this is because the only current present in the gl theory is the london supercurrent @xmath1 , which is proportional to @xmath2 . for a solution with a",
    "_ static _ superfluid density , @xmath1 is the same everywhere along the wire , so , at a nonzero @xmath1 , @xmath0 can not vanish at any point . since vanishing of @xmath0 is necessary for the phase to unwind , it is by no means obvious that the lamh saddle point actually mediates transitions between different winding numbers .",
    "one may equally well imagine that the system starts at a winding number @xmath3 , reaches the lamh saddle point , and then rolls down along the negative mode , but remains all the time in the sector with the same winding number .",
    "therefore , one is justified in looking for fluctuations ( with _ time - dependent _ densities ) that have a zero of @xmath0 and thus allow the phase to unwind .",
    "such fluctuations have been observed in numerical studies of superfluids flowing past obstacles @xcite , see also ref .",
    "the studies of ref .",
    "@xcite have used boundary conditions corresponding to a fixed value of superfluid velocity away from the obstacle . here",
    "we want to consider transitions between states with different values of superfluid velocity and so use periodic boundary conditions ( the ring geometry ) . in this case",
    ", the winding number in the vicinity of a uniform supercurrent state must be an integer .    in a nearly uniform bose fluid ,",
    "a natural candidate for the critical fluctuation is one of the many time - dependent solutions ( solitons @xcite ) of the perfectly uniform problem . according to the preceding discussion , we need a field for which the order parameter is completely extinguished at some point . for a large enough length @xmath4 of the ring , a solution having",
    "this property is ( x , t ) = _ 1 e^-it + i m v_1 x . [ moving ] here @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are suitably chosen constants ( @xmath6 is real , @xmath5 is complex ) , @xmath7 , @xmath3 is the winding number of a nearby uniform state ( an integer ) , @xmath8 is the mass of the particle , and @xmath9 is the `` healing '' length , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the coupling constant .",
    "the field ( [ moving ] ) solves the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation at zero external potential , and represents a depletion of density moving at velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the classical energy of this state is computed in the appendix .",
    "the momentum of this state is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total number of particles .",
    "relative to the uniform state with winding @xmath3 and superfluid velocity @xmath15 , the momentum is p = mv_1n - mv_0 n = n , [ dp ] where @xmath16 is the linear density . in the limit @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath3 fixed",
    ", the field ( [ moving ] ) becomes the classical counterpart of the extremal point of the lieb - liniger spectrum of the corresponding quantum problem  a bose gas with a delta - function repulsion .",
    "note that , while in the limit of small @xmath12 the solution ( [ moving ] ) is in a certain sense close to the corresponding lamh saddle point , for larger @xmath12 the two solutions are substantially different .",
    "we want to identify ( [ moving ] ) as a critical droplet mediating transitions between supercurrent states with winding numbers @xmath3 and @xmath19 , i.e. , superfluid velocities @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this identification shows immediately that in a nearly uniform superfluid taps may be strongly suppressed .",
    "indeed , if the droplet is to decay into a state with winding @xmath3 , the momentum @xmath22 needs to be transferred to another excitation branch , i.e. , phonons , or to some external system .",
    "a look at the lieb - liniger spectrum tells us that any phonon state with momentum @xmath22 has energy larger than the energy of the droplet state .",
    "the nearly uniform limit can be realized in a variety of physical systems .",
    "an interesting and perhaps somewhat unexpected realization is a thin superconducting wire . in this case , the analog of bogoliubov s phonon is the gapless plasmon mode , describing fluctuations of the superconducting density .",
    "the large - scale ( `` hydrodynamic '' ) effective theory of these plasmons is a gp theory , with the coupling constant @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the capacitance of the wire per unit length ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this description of superconductors is specific to one dimension , and the reason why it holds is that in 1d the screening of charges is weak , so the large - scale dynamics is dominated by the charging energy , rather than the energy of condensation ( as in the gl theory ) .",
    "the order parameter @xmath0 of this description is proportional ( but not necessarily equal ) to the gl order parameter .",
    "it can be interpreted as the field of cooper pairs , and the entire description applies only at length scales larger than the `` size '' of a pair , i.e. , the gl coherence length @xmath25 . since in practice @xmath25 is much larger than the `` healing '' length @xmath26 obtained from the gp description , the size of a critical droplet will now be determined by @xmath25 , rather than @xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless , as we discuss further in the concluding section , it is possible to adapt some of our results to this case . in particular",
    ", we expect that at scales of order @xmath25 disorder , typically present in superconducting wires , self - averages , so that as an initial approximation we can use the uniform limit with suitably renormalized parameters . at the next level of accuracy",
    ", we will need to include momentum transfer to disorder via various mechanisms .",
    "another possible realization of the nearly uniform limit is atomic superfluids  specifically , trapped bose gases  which can in principle be prepared is such a way that there are no significant sources of disorder on scales shorter than the healing length . in this case",
    ", the above considerations suggest that the requirement of momentum transfer can present a major bottleneck for taps .",
    "we want to stress that , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , in _ quantum _ theory phase slips occur even in a perfectly uniform superfluid , by thermally - assisted tunneling with momentum transfer to phonons .",
    "the question we address in the present paper is whether phase slips are possible by a _",
    "classical _ mechanism , such as thermal activation .",
    "this question is particularly relevant at temperatures @xmath27 ( @xmath11 is the coupling constant ) , where the approximate methods used in refs .",
    "@xcite do not apply .    here , we attempt to simulate taps numerically , using classical equations of motion .",
    "our simulations are microcanonical , i.e. , there is no coupling to any external heat bath , and are similar in spirit to simulations of sphaleron transitions in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional abelian higgs model @xcite . in our case , however , because of the exact solvability of the theory at zero potential @xcite , we take special measures to ensure appropriate population of the phase space ( see below ) .",
    "our main result is the complete absence , within the classical mechanics , of taps in the uniform bose gas .",
    "this leaves quantum tunneling as the only mechanism of supercurrent decay in this case .",
    "we have found that taps appear in the presence of an external potential @xmath28 , but at a rate that depends sensitively on the magnitude and scale of variation of @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath29 is smooth and not too large , the rate is much smaller than that derived from the lamh theory .",
    "fluctuations that mediate taps in such a smooth potential are similar to the field ( [ moving ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "details of the numerical procedure are described in sects .",
    "[ sect : init ] ( initial conditions ) and [ sect : method ] ( the evolution algorithm ) .",
    "numerical results are presented in sect .",
    "[ sect : res ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sect : concl ] , where we also discuss some applications of our results .",
    "for the evolution equation , we have used the gp equation i = - _ x^2 + g    here @xmath30 is the complex order parameter , @xmath8 is the mass of the particles , @xmath31 is the coupling constant , and @xmath28 is an external potential . for the uniform case , @xmath32 .",
    "we have set @xmath33 .",
    "important parameters that we will often use in what follows are the zero - temperature speed of bogoliubov s phonons c_0 = ( g/ m)^1/2 [ c_0 ] and the zero - temperature `` healing '' length = ( 4 gm)^-1/2 ; [ xi ] @xmath34 is the average density of the gas . in a classical simulation , @xmath34",
    "is obtained as the average of the density @xmath35 over the entire lattice : = dx ^ .",
    "[ nave ]    a precise characterization of temperature was not a goal of the present work .",
    "this allowed us to initialize the field directly from the phonon power spectrum .",
    "namely , suppose we separate the initial field @xmath0 into the modulus ( square root of the density ) and the phase : ( x , t_i ) = e^i(x ) .",
    "[ separ ] for the phase , we write ( x ) = + _ 0",
    "+ _ 1(x ) , [ wind ] where @xmath36 is the initial winding number , @xmath37 is an uninteresting constant , which will be set to zero , and @xmath38 is a fluctuation . for the density , we write n(x ) = + n(x ) , [ dndef ] where @xmath34 is the uniform average density , which we specify , and @xmath39 is a fluctuation .",
    "next , the fluctuations @xmath38 and @xmath39 are expressed using bogoliubov s transformation _",
    "1(x ) & = & 1 _ k 0 e^ik x , [ theta ] + n(x ) & = & i _ k 0 e^ik x , [ dn ] where _ k & = & c_0 [ k^2 + k^4 ^2]^1/2 , + z_k & = & g ( 1 + k^2 ^2 ) . [ z ] in our classical simulation , we take @xmath40 and @xmath41 to be random classical variables , whose moduli are given by the bose distribution |b_k|^2 = ( e^_k / t - 1)^-1 , [ occup ] where _ k = _ k + v k .",
    "[ omega_k ] is the quasiparticle dispersion law in the presence of a superfluid velocity @xmath42 .",
    "the phase of @xmath40 is a ( pseudo)random number uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath43 .    in numerical work , instead of ( [ separ ] ) we use the linearized version = n ( 1 + ) e^i , [ recon ] where @xmath44 is a normalization coefficient enforcing the condition ( [ nave ] ) .    the use of the linearized eq .",
    "( [ recon ] ) is consistent with the assumption @xmath45 of bogoliubov s theory and with using the ideal - gas distribution ( [ occup ] ) for phonons .",
    "but how far is the result from the true equilibrium of the interacting system and how much should we worry about the difference ?    to begin with , notice that for a classical field the notion of a `` true '' equilibrium applies only to the low - frequency component , @xmath46 , which is more or less classical . for a taps , we expect @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 , so that at @xmath49 a taps is essentially a classical fluctuation . for high - frequency modes ,",
    "the classical approximation is not parametrically justified , but under the above condition on the temperature these only provide a `` heat bath '' , and we do not expect the results to depend very sensitively on the model we choose for them .    by the same token",
    ", it seems extremely unlikely that modest deviations from thermal equilibrium can jeopardize the qualitative results of this work ( such as vanishing of the taps rate in the uniform system ) .",
    "one may , however , raise the objection that , in the uniform case or for a weak potential , our way of generating the initial conditions may not populate adequately the lieb - liniger branch , to which for instance the state ( [ moving ] ) belongs . to counter this objection , we subject the field , after it has been initialized as described above , to a `` premixing '' stage , wherein it evolves for a while in a relatively strong potential .",
    "after that , the potential is switched to the desired strength , the winding number is reset to the original value , and the actual evolution begins .",
    "premixing causes further deviations from thermal equilibrium but these are again deemed harmless for the reason stated above .",
    "two further comments are in order :    \\(i ) bogoliubov s theory @xcite , when formulated in terms of density and phase , as in ( [ theta ] ) and ( [ dn ] ) , requires smallness of @xmath39 but does not require either smallness of @xmath38 or a non - vanishing expectation of the order parameter .",
    "it is therefore applicable even in 1d , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) within that theory , the properly subtracted variance of the density is n^2 _ t - n^2 _",
    "t=0 = _ -^ , [ varn ] of main interest to us here is the temperature region @xmath50 . for an estimate of @xmath39",
    ", we will assume the limit t = 2 g .",
    "[ high - t ] in this limit , the integral in ( [ varn ] ) is saturated at small @xmath51 : @xmath52 ( this infrared sensitivity is specific to one dimension ) . at these @xmath51",

    "[ varn2 ] we conclude that ( unless @xmath42 is very close to @xmath54 ) the smallness of a typical density fluctuation , @xmath55 , requires that t c_0 .",
    "[ tcond ] this condition is compatible with ( [ high - t ] ) , provided the dimensionless coupling @xmath56 is chosen small .",

    "this is not surprising given that , in the present simulation , fluctuations of density are relatively large : @xmath87 is about half of @xmath34 . since the typical wavelength of these fluctuations is of the same order as the size of the droplet [ cf .",

    "we find this result nontrivial and even surprising , given that momentum conservation , while characteristic of the uniform system , by itself does not prohibit phase slips : momentum released from the supercurrent can be absorbed by phonons . indeed , _ quantum - mechanically _ , phase slips are possible even in the perfectly uniform system @xcite .",
    "what we have shown here , then , is that quantum effects remain the only source of supercurrent decay in the uniform case .",
    "our results , both for the uniform system and in the presence of a potential , are consistent with identifying the moving droplet ( [ moving ] ) as the fluctuation mediating thermal phase slips . as we have already noted , at nonzero @xmath12 it is distinct from the lamh saddle point .",

    "the latter differs from the gp hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) only by the value of the quartic coupling @xmath11 and by the presence of a @xmath2 term , which in the gp case would correspond to a chemical potential .",
