    "the potts hamiltonian ( [ hpotts ] ) is unchanged under the global circular shift @xmath40 .",
    "this @xmath41-symmetry is broken in the low - temperature phase , where a majority of spins can be found in the same state .",
    "the order parameter @xmath42 , called magnetization , can therefore be defined as m = q_max.-1q-1where @xmath43 is the fraction of spins in the majority state . + in the following , we are interested in the influence of quenched disorder coupled to the energy density . on each lattice edge @xmath44 , joining the two neighboring sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the exchange coupling @xmath45 appearing in the hamiltonian ( [ hpotts ] ) is replaced by a random variable @xmath46 : h=-_(i , j ) j_ij__i,_j [ h_rbpm]the calculation of the thermodynamic quantities requires an average over both the thermal fluctuations and the coupling configurations : = _ \\{j_ij } ( \\{j_ij } ) .the average over thermal fluctuations is denoted by brackets , for example @xmath47 in the case of magnetization .",

    "the fluctuations of the numbers of couplings @xmath18 and @xmath19 in a coupling configuration have been moreover shown to be an irrelevant perturbation at the random fixed point  @xcite .",
    "the self - duality condition ( [ selfduality1 ] ) is very general and still holds in the case of correlated disorder .      in order to generate the coupling configurations @xmath49 of the potts model ,",
    "an auxiliary isotropic ashkin - teller model is simulated .",

    "we are therefore in presence of a griffiths phase , like in the mccoy - wu model . as mentioned in the introduction , the occurrence of such a griffiths phase in the mccoy - wu model",

    "[ serie_chi ] ) , the main contribution comes from disorder configurations with a slightly negative polarization , i.e. a number of strong couplings slightly below the number of weak ones .",
    "in such configurations , different clusters of weak or strong couplings are typically observed .",

    "our model shares two important similarities with the mccoy - wu model : a griffiths phase occurs in a finite range of temperatures around the self - dual point and scaling dimensions are independent of the number of potts states @xmath0 .",

    "our estimates of @xmath140 display a small violation of the hyperscaling relation .",
    "this violation is shown to be caused by the exact cancellation of two terms , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , whose difference gives the average susceptibility , as in the 3d random - field ising model .",
    "such a mechanism leads to an hyperscaling violation unless the largest correction of any of the two terms @xmath161 or @xmath162 diverge only logarithmically . from the scaling of @xmath161 and @xmath162 ,",
    "an exponent @xmath163 satisfying the hyperscaling relation can be extracted . because the specific heat does not diverge , the exponent @xmath164 is negative or zero .",
    "however , it can also be written as the difference of two diverging terms . from them , an exponent @xmath165 is defined and shown to be compatible with @xmath166 for any number of potts state and any temperature in the griffiths phase . because the same mechanism than in the magnetic sector takes place , the energy scaling dimension is conjectured to be given by @xmath167 which implies @xmath168 .",
    "the exponent @xmath14 is extracted from the finite - size scaling of @xmath169 at different temperatures of the griffiths phase .",

    "of course , these results have been obtained for finite - size systems so we can not exclude completely the possibility that the griffiths phase disappears at much larger lattice sizes and that the hyperscaling relation is restored .",
    "indeed , one could argue that the existence of this griffiths phase is related to the large fluctuations of the number of strong and weak couplings from sample to sample .",
    "these fluctuations are indeed expected to vanish in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath172 but are still very large for the lattice sizes that were considered , much larger than for uncorrelated disorder .",
    "if the griffiths phase is only due to these fluctuations , its width should also vanish in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath172 .",
    "the numerical data seems to indicate that it is not the case : the distance between the two peaks of the average magnetic susceptibility on figure  [ chi - q_8 ] is roughly @xmath173 for @xmath94 and @xmath174 for @xmath88 .",
    "there is therefore a reduction of the width but much smaller that the expected factor @xmath175 for @xmath78 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the griffiths phase does not seem to be a consequence of only the fluctuations of the number of strong and weak couplings .",
    "of course , much larger lattice sizes would help to clarify this point .",
    "another possibility would be to study correlated disorder with a larger exponent @xmath13 , which is not possible with the two - dimensional ashkin - teller model .",
    "another interesting point would be to understand precisely why the critical behavior observed in this model does not fall into the same universality as the @xmath11 model studied by weinrib and halperin .",
    "further renormalization group studies could probably clarify the role of @xmath10-point disorder correlations functions .",
