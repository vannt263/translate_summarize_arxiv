    "the extraction of the fundamental parameters of hadrons from experimental results requires some information about the physics at large distance .",
    "unfortunately such an information can not be achieved from the first principles of a fundamental theory . indeed qcd , which is believed to be the candidate of such an underlying theory of the strong interactions , has very complicated infrared behavior which makes it impossible to calculate the properties of of the hadrons starting from a fundamental qcd lagrangian . therefore for determination of the parameters of hadrons a reliable nonperturbative approach is needed . among all nonperturbative approaches , qcd sum rules method which was originally proposed by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite and adopted or extended in many works @xcite@xcite ,",
    "is particularly a powerful one in studying the properties of the low  lying hadrons . in traditional qcd sum rules method",
    "@xcite the nonperturbative approach is taken into account through various condensates in the nontrivial qcd vacuum .    in this work",
    "we employ an alternative approach to the traditional sum rules , namely light cone qcd sum rules method , to study @xmath1 decay coupling constant .",
    "light cone sum rules is based on the operator product expansion on the light cone , which is an expansion over the twists of the operators rather than dimensions in the traditional sum rules .",
    "the main contribution comes from the lowest twist operator .",
    "the matrix elements of the nonlocal operators sandwiched between a hadronic state and the vacuum defines the hadronic wane function ( more about application of light cone qcd sum rules can be found in @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .    in general @xmath1 decay",
    "is described by the electric quadrapole e2 and magnetic dipole m1 transition amplitudes .",
    "however , it is well known that the electric quadrapole amplitude is very small compared to that of the magnetic dipole amplitude ( see @xcite and references therein ) . therefore in this work",
    "we consider only the magnetic dipole contribution .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath3 is involved in phenomenological models in investigation of the many reactions of the strong and electromagnetic interactions and it is expected to be measured more precisely in the pion photo production experiments at tjnal ( former cebaf ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the light cone qcd sum rules for the radiative @xmath1 is presented .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis and discussion of the results .",
    "in studying the @xmath1 decay constant we first introduce the interpolating currents for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 baryons @xcite _ ^+^&= & ^abc  , + _ n & = & ^abc u_a^t c _ u_b _ 5 ^d_c  , where @xmath7 are up and down quark fields , respectively , and @xmath8 is the charge conjugation operator , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the color indices . note that this choice of nucleon interpolating currents is not unique and other choices can be used ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the overlap amplitudes of the interpolating currents with the baryons are defined as 0 _ n n & = & _ n u_n  , + 0 _ ^&= & _",
    "u_^  , where @xmath11 is the rarita  schwinger spinor .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath0 for the @xmath1 decay is defined as follows n .= i e g_n",
    "_ |u_n ^q^^u_^  , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the polarization vector and momentum of the photon , respectively , @xmath14 is the electric charge .    according to the qcd sum rules ideology",
    ", the quantitative estimates of the @xmath0 coupling constant can be obtained by equating the two different representations of a suitable correlator , written in terms of hadrons and quark  gluon language . for this purpose",
    "we start our analysis by considering the following correlator ( p , q ) = d^4x e^ipx ( q ) \\ { _ ( 0 ) |_n ( x ) } 0  . saturating ( 4 ) by @xmath5 and nucleons and using eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we get for the phenomenological part of the correlator i e g_n ( p ) + . the main theoretical problem being the calculation of eq . ( 4 ) in qcd .",
    "this problem can be solved in the deep euclidean region where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are negative and large .",
    "after lengthy calculations , at quark level we have obtained the following expression for the correlator function + & & \\ { - 4 ( q ) |d _ 5 _ d 0 + & & + 2 ( q ) |d _ 0 + & & - 4 ( q ) |u _ 5 _ u 0 + & & + 2 ( q ) |u _ u 0 }  , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the full light quark propagator with both perturbative and nonperturbative contributions is(x,0 ) & = & 0 \\ { |q(x ) q(0 ) } 0 + & = & i - - m_0 ^ 2 |q q + & - & i g_s _ 0 ^ 1 du \\ { _ g^(ux ) - 4 i u g^(ux ) _ } + it follows from eq .",
    "( 6 ) that , in order to calculate the correlator function @xmath19 in qcd , the matrix elements @xmath20 and @xmath21 are needed .",

    "^q^x^_0 ^ 1 du e^iuqx ( u )  , +   + ( q ) |q _ q 0 & = & i e_q e |q q _ 0 ^ 1 du e^iuqx + & & \\ { _ q_- _ q _ + & + & g_2 ( u ) }  . where the parameter @xmath22 is the magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate and @xmath23 is the quark charge . in further analysis",
    "the path ordered gauge factor exp _",

    "the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 in eq .",

    "as has been noted already , the qcd sum rule is obtained as usual by equating the hadronic representation of the correlator ( 4 ) with the result of the qcd calculation . in order to take into account the contributions of the higher states we invoke the quark ",
    "hadron duality prescription , i.e. , above certain thresholds in @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the double spectral density @xmath33 for the higher states and continuum coincides with the spectral density calculated in qcd .    after performing double borel transformation with respect to the variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 in eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 9 ) to suppress the higher states , we finally get the following sum rules for the @xmath34 coupling constant g_n _ _ n & = & - e^m^2/m^2 \\ { e_u - e_d + & + & g^2 g^2 }  , where the function f_n(x)=1-e^-x_k=0^n  , is the factor used to subtract the continuum , @xmath35 is the continuum threshold and u_0 =  ,  m^2 =  , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the borel parameters .",
    "since masses of the proton , and @xmath38 are very close to each other , we can choose @xmath36 and @xmath37 to be equal to each other , i.e. , @xmath39 , from which it follows that @xmath40 .",
    "it follows from eq . ( 10 ) that the main input parameters of the sum rules are photon wave functions .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the leading photon wave functions receives only small corrections from the higher conformal spin , so they do not deviate much from the asymptotic form .",
    "following @xcite@xcite , we shall use for the photon wave function ( u ) & = & 6 u |u  , + ( u ) & = & 1  , + g_1(u ) & = & - |u ( 3 -u )  , + g_2(u ) & = & - |u^2  , where @xmath41 .",
    "the values of the other input parameters we have used : @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite at the scale @xmath44 , @xmath45 and for the continuum threshold @xmath35 we have chosen two different values , i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . having fixed the input parameters , one must find the range of values of @xmath48 for which the sum rule ( 10 ) is reliable .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath48 is usually determined by the condition that the terms proportional to the highest inverse power of the borel parameter stay reasonably small .",
    "the upper limit is determined by demanding that the continuum and and higher state contribution does not get too large , say less than @xmath49 of the leading twist contributions .",
    "both conditions are satisfied in the interval @xmath50 .",
    "the dependence of the right side of eq .",
    "( 10 ) on @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "it follows from this figure in that the above  mentioned working region of @xmath48 the sum rule is quite stable . from this figure",
    "one can directly predict that g_n _ _ n = ( 0.0020 0.0004 )   gev^5 . dividing this product of couplings by the residues of proton and @xmath5 currents @xmath51 and @xmath52 , that were calculated in the analysis of mass sum rules for baryons @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) g_n= 1.6 0.2  gev^-1 .",
    "this prediction of the coupling constant permits us to estimate the width of the @xmath53 decay . using the matrix element for the @xmath53 transition ( see eq .",
