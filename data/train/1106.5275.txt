    "the determination of the ground state properties of strongly interacting quantum systems is of considerable interest . as",
    "only a very few models are exactly solvable , numerical approximation methods are of significant importance .",
    "a key challenge in this respect is the ` curse of dimensionality ' , namely the exponential growth of the hilbert space dimension with the number of sites .",
    "ingenious methods such as the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach @xcite can overcome this problem as they amount to formulating a variational problem over a well - chosen class of quantum states that can be parametrized efficiently , i.e. with a polynomial number of parameters @xcite . as the variation is over a subclass of all possible quantum states , variational methods of this type",
    "provide upper bounds on the ground state energy .",
    "assessing the quality of the so obtained upper bounds on the ground state energy is then difficult . hence there is considerable interest in the development of efficient methods for the determination of lower bounds on the ground state energy .",
    "one straightforward approach in this direction consists in the determination of anderson bounds @xcite , i.e. the decomposition of a hamiltonian @xmath0 and the subsequent determination of the ground state energy of each @xmath1 whose sum then yields a lower bound on the ground state energy of @xmath2 . while useful , this approach does not scale well with the system size as it remains exponential in the size of the support of the @xmath1 .",
    "the application of dmrg to the @xmath1 may overcome the scaling issue but amounts to finding an ` upper bound to a lower bound ' and does not resolve the principal issue with dmrg .    as early as @xmath3 , however , it was suggested to avoid the use of wave functions altogether and rather consider reduced density matrices together with conditions that these arise from a valid quantum state @xcite  the so - called n - representability problem @xcite .",
    "varying over the reduced density matrices that are compatible with a valid physical state then allows for the determination of the ground state energy .",
    "the exact ground state energy can be obtained if all conditions for the n - representability problem are known .",
    "if only partial conditions are specified , then one minimizes over too large a set of reduced density matrices and one obtains a lower bound on the ground state energy .",
    "the analytical treatment of this problem is highly challenging and at the time numerical solutions were hard to come by .",
    "further progress was made by mazziotti @xcite , who pointed out that the problem can be formulated as a semi - definite programme and use can be made of the guaranteed and certified convergence of the primal - dual interior - point algorithm for semi - definite programming @xcite .",
    "a general mathematical framework for this type of optimization problems and applications was given in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the primal - dual interior - point algorithm and related methods do come with a considerable overhead in computation time and , crucially , memory that is making it hard to scale to very large systems . lately",
    ", new algorithms to address the optimization problems of finding lower bounds on ground state energies have been developed @xcite and considerable improvements towards the interior - point algorithms have been demonstrated .    in this work",
    ", we are exploring further the idea of relaxations of the ground state energy finding problem that allow us to determine lower bounds on the ground state energy in an efficient manner . to this end",
    "we formulate the problem , introduce a number of simplifications including the explicit treatment of translation invariance and symmetries and point out additional potential routes for numerical simplifications .",
    "in addition , we present a novel algorithm , principally a combination of a projected gradient algorithm with dykstra s algorithm @xcite , for solving the resulting optimization problem in a memory - efficient manner and prove its convergence . then , in order to demonstrate the capabilities of this approach , we present numerical experiments that determine lower bounds on the ground state energies for two one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice models , namely the ising and heisenberg hamiltonian , which confirm that the approach can be applied for large systems especially when implementing translational invariance .",
    "note that although we restrict our numerical analysis to 1d lattice models it has been demonstrated that the variational determination of ground state energies considering only constraints on reduced density matrices applies to higher spatial dimensions @xcite and to non - periodic systems such as molecules in quantum chemistry @xcite as well .",
    "we complete this work with a discussion and outlook .",
    "we begin by explaining the general ideas underlying the method for the determination of lower bounds on ground state energies following @xcite and then specialize to the case of fermionic systems , for which later sections will provide numerical examples .",
    "analogous ideas can also be implemented for bosonic systems or general spin - systems .",
    "the determination of the ground state energy @xmath4 of a many - body system composed of @xmath5 particles and described by the hamilton operator @xmath2 can be formulated as the minimization problem @xmath6\\ , \\vert \\",
    ", \\rho\\geq 0,\\ , { \\mbox{\\textbf{tr}}}\\left[\\rho\\right]=1\\right\\}.       \\label{eqn : originaloptimizationproblem}\\ ] ] this approach is pushed to its limits rather rapidly as it uses the positivity constraint on @xmath7 , which grows dramatically with the system size , e.g. for particles with spin-@xmath8 or spinless fermions @xmath7 is a @xmath9 matrix .",
    "hence , this problem can not be solved efficiently due to the exponentially increasing parameter space .",
    "one technique to deal with this difficulty is to parametrize a specific family of candidates @xmath10 for the ground state by a set of parameters @xmath11 .",
    "one then minimizes the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to this family of states . as this family of states",
    "does not encompass the entire state space , this method will find a state @xmath12 which is optimal in @xmath13 and which yields an upper bound on the true ground state energy .",
    "this is the route taken by a variety of variational methods including , for example , dmrg @xcite .    to overcome the scaling issues and to provide lower rather than upper bounds on the ground state energy , we need to relax the positivity constraint @xmath14 , replacing it by a weaker set of constraints which scale only polynomially in the system s size @xcite .",
    "this enlarges the class of states over which one varies the energy and hence yields lower bounds on the ground state energy . to this end",

    "judicious choice of the set @xmath19 alleviates this shortcoming .",
    "indeed , writing @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the coefficients of the operators @xmath31 in the hamiltonian @xmath2 , one ensures that the set @xmath19 contains all operators such that for all @xmath32 the expectation value @xmath33 is in @xmath34 .",
    "note , furthermore , that the entries of @xmath23 will generally not be independent but suffer some linear equality constraints , for example due to ( anti)-commutation relations between operators . denoting by @xmath35 the set of all hermitian matrices that satisfy @xmath36 and any other linear constraints ,",
    "the energy minimization problem can be written as @xcite @xmath37 which is evidently a semi - definite programme @xcite and efficiently solvable as long as the set @xmath19 contains a number of operators that scale polynomially in system size . the decomposition of @xmath2 into @xmath31 , and hence the choice of the set @xmath38 , is not unique and the optimal choice is not obvious . from a practical point of view however , the systematic choice presented in the remainder of the paper leading to the so - called p - positivity conditions @xcite does perhaps provide the most straightforward formulation .      for concreteness ,",
    "let us now consider the class of bosonic or fermionic operators defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 are arbitrary complex variables .",
    "the n - representability conditions arising from this class of operators are called 1-positivity and 2-positivity conditions , which is a terminology used to reveal the powers of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 in @xmath16 . in general , allowing polynomials of order p in the second - quantized operators leads to restrictions called p - positivity conditions @xcite .",
    "for the particular choice of operators of the order of 2 , requiring the positivity of @xmath43 is equivalent to @xmath44 where the @xmath45 matrices comprising the second moments are defined as follows : @xmath46 and for the third and fourth moments , we find the @xmath47 and @xmath48 matrices @xmath49 in addition to the positivity constraint on the @xmath50 hermitian matrix @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the vector space of all hermitian matrices with appropriate dimension , there are linear constraints relating its entries .",
    "in fact , the fermionic anti - commutator relations @xmath53 or the bosonic commutator relations @xmath54 = \\left[a_{k}^{\\dagger},a_{l}^{\\dagger}\\right ] = 0 , \\quad \\left[a_{k},a_{l}^{\\dagger}\\right]=\\delta_{k , l}\\ ] ] force some entries of @xmath23 to be equal , to differ by sign or to be a linear function of others .",
    "now , let @xmath35 be the set of all positive semi - definite hermitian matrices of the form eq . and satisfying the additional requirement that the entries of @xmath23 obey the constraints given by the commutation or anti - commutation relations .",
    "further , let @xmath55 be a function expressing the expectation value of a hamiltonian with up to 4-mode terms , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "then , the original optimization problem eq . can be replaced by @xmath57 where the relaxed optimization problem scales polynomially in the system size @xmath5 .",
    "note that it is straightforward to extend this formulation to higher moments , e.g. 3-positivity conditions . in the following",
    ", we are going to present scenarios and strategies where the number of free variables can be decreased considerably .      for the remainder we will consider fermionic systems . in that case ,",
    "superselection rules require that the hamiltonian commutes with the parity operator given by @xmath58 . as a consequence , only hamiltonians comprising terms with an even number of creation and annihilation operators are physically allowed .",
    "this in turn ensures that only expectation values of products of an even number of creation and annihilation operators are non - vanishing .",
    "hence , we find that we can restrict @xmath23 to take the form @xmath59 and to satisfy the constraints dictated by the fermionic anti - commutator relations",
    ". see appendix [ app : constraints ] for a list of constraints on the entries for a formulation for up to fourth moments in the fermionic case .    if the hamiltonian conserves the particle number , a further simplification ensues . in this case , each term in the hamiltonian will consist of an equal number of annihilation and creation operators .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation @xmath60 and @xmath61 and we find that expectation values vanish unless they concern operators with the same number of annihilation and creation operators so that @xmath23 can be assumed to take the form @xmath62 note that the elements of the matrices @xmath63 are coefficients of the one - electron reduced density matrix ( 1-rdm ) , while the matrices @xmath64 are representations of the two - electron reduced density matrix ( 2-rdm ) @xcite . restricting matrices of the form eq . to be positive semi - definite",
    "is equivalent with the positivity of the individual matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this constraint on the matrices containing the second moments defines the 1-positivity conditions , while the positivity of the matrices containing the fourth moments generates the 2-positivity conditions @xcite .",
    "for concreteness we list the matrices comprising the constraints on a system composed of two spinless fermions and the additional assumption of particle number conservation in appendix [ app : constraints ] .",
    "so far we considered optimization problems for up to 2-positivity conditions which reduced the number of free variables to scale as @xmath65 .",
    "apart from superselection rules and the particle number conservation , no specific assumption on the structure of the underlying hamiltonian has been exploited such that in principle this procedure is applicable to a wide range of different systems , e.g. quantum chemistry calculations @xcite or higher spacial dimensions @xcite . since",
    "our intention is to apply this method to large lattice models , we now discuss a further simplification of the system to decrease the number of parameters , namely the translational invariance .",
    "translation invariance with periodic boundary conditions of the physical system reduces the number of free variables considerably .",
    "in fact for the second moments , i.e. for the matrices @xmath63 and @xmath66 , this can be exploited immediately as these matrices then obey @xmath67 , etc .",
    "consequently , for translational invariant systems with periodic boundary conditions , the matrices comprising the second moments become circulant matrices @xcite and can therefore be diagonalized by a discrete fourier transform @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "reducing the number of variables for the fourth moments is not so transparent as for the second moments , but manageable .",
    "to do so , note that the ordering of the entries of the matrices @xmath70 and @xmath71 is not fixed but can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "remember that the indices of these matrices are of the form @xmath72 $ ] for @xmath73 . rearranging the two - digit indices labeling the rows and columns in the following way : @xmath74 the matrices comprising the fourth moments decompose in a block structure where each block can be diagonalized by the unitary matrix @xmath75 given above .",
    "for example , we find for the matrix @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 with @xmath79 given by eq . and @xmath80 with diagonal matrices @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "hence , for translational invariant systems the matrices contained in set @xmath35 will have the following form : @xmath83 where the matrices denoting the second moments in the upper left block are diagonal matrices and the matrices considering the fourth moments have a block diagonal structure as described above .",
    "these considerations reduce the complexity of the constraints considerably and hence make the numerical study feasible for large systems .",
    "as the treatment of the fourth - order correlations is computationally costly , it may in some cases be advantageous to consider fourth - order constraints on a smaller lattice , while the computationally cheaper second - order constraints are treated on the full lattice . in particular , while @xmath84 and @xmath85 are @xmath86 matrices , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are @xmath87 matrices leading to the unfavourable scaling . to overcome this issue , it might therefore be beneficial to restrict higher moments to smaller subsystems ; that is , for the second moments one would consider system size @xmath88 , while for fourth moments one would consider @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "reducing the support of the matrices @xmath70 and @xmath71 , on the one hand , will lead to disproportionate savings in memory and computation time and , on the other hand , will certainly lead to a decrease of the lower bounds .",
    "so far we have described how to relax the original optimization problem eq .   and discussed how to include symmetries to reduce the number of free variables .",
    "now we are going to describe an iterative algorithm for addressing this minimization problem .",
    "recall the minimization problem we have to face , that is , @xmath91 where again the function @xmath92 expresses @xmath93 and the set @xmath35 consists of all positive semi - definite hermitian matrices @xmath23 fulfilling the constraints dictated by the ( anti)-commutator relations and potential other symmetries of the system .",
    "note that the function @xmath94 is indeed linear in the elements of matrix @xmath23 and hence could be written as @xmath95 + c,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is a hermitian matrix and @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , the set @xmath35 is the intersection of the convex cone consisting of positive semi - definite matrices and the affine set defined by the linear constraints on the entries . hence @xmath35 is convex , too  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that this optimization problem is in fact a semi - definite programme and as such can be solved efficiently .",
    "standard primal - dual interior point methods for semi - definite programming come with a considerable overhead in memory and time which makes their application to large systems challenging .",
    "recently , two algorithms addressing the problem of ground state energy estimation were developed which scale better than the conventional methods @xcite .",
    "here , we continue the research for efficient algorithms and formulate an alternative numerical method whose efficacy we demonstrate in later sections .    to address the issues described above , we suggest to solve the minimization problem by a projected gradient algorithm @xcite .",
    "since this algorithm relies heavily on projections onto convex sets , we need to define the latter .",
    "let @xmath52 be a vector space and @xmath98 be a convex set .",
    "the projection of @xmath99 onto @xmath100 is defined by @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the frobenius or hilbert - schmidt norm .",
    "as the name suggests , the projection determines the nearest point in the convex set @xmath100 with respect to a given norm . with this",
    ", we claim that the solution of problem eq .",
    "could be found by iterating @xmath103 where the algorithm is initialized by a hermitian matrix @xmath104 and @xmath105 is an arbitrary real and positive number .",
    "furthermore , @xmath106 denotes the projection onto set @xmath35 , i.e. the intersection of the positive semi - definite hermitian matrices and the set given by the linear constraints .",
    "the scheme of this algorithm is visualized in figure [ fig : algorithm ] .     and",
    "@xmath107 have a nonempty intersection , which is shown shaded .",
    "the straight parallel lines clarify the level sets of the function @xmath94 such that @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the minimum value the function attains on the intersection .",
    "the projections are represented by arrows to demonstrate their directions .",
    "note that these projections are computed using dykstra s algorithm , which itself uses the projections onto @xmath100 and @xmath107 .",
    "the algorithm is initialized with the matrix @xmath110 .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we find that the following lemma holds .    let @xmath111 be a linear function of the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath97 is a constant .",

    "let @xmath117 be the sequence determined by the iterations of the algorithm eq .  .",
    "then @xmath118 where @xmath119 for all @xmath116 .",
    "[ lemma : gradientprojection ]    a detailed proof of this lemma is presented in appendix [ app : proofconvergence ] .",
    "so far we have shifted the problem of minimizing the function @xmath94 with respect to the convex set @xmath35 to the problem of computing the projection onto @xmath35 . as pointed out above",
    ", this set is the intersection of two convex sets .",
    "this complicates the computation of the projection because in principle one has to solve the optimization problem eq .   in each step of the algorithm . the most obvious method at hand to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to use dykstra s algorithm @xcite .",
    "dykstra s algorithm is an elaborate technique to compute the projection of @xmath23 onto the intersection of several convex sets by means of modified iterative projections onto the individual sets . to apply this procedure to the computation onto @xmath35 we need to determine the projections onto the set of positive semi - definite hermitian matrices and onto the affine set given by the constraints imposed by the canonical ( anti)-commutation relations and other symmetries .",
    "the former can be implemented straightforwardly .",
    "for the latter we were able to determine formulae for the submatrices in eq .   and thus gain a method to compute @xmath120 efficiently .",
    "note that since @xmath35 is convex , @xmath121 is unique for all @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "further , the proposed algorithm finds a lower bound on the ground state energy by only considering boundary points of the feasible set and hence is slightly related to the algorithm proposed in @xcite .",
    "there are two parameters defining the accuracy of the estimated lower bound . in principle",
    "the algorithm converges for perfect projections @xmath121 to a matrix @xmath116 minimizing the function @xmath94 in the limit @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the iteration number . as for all iterative algorithms",
    "we need to introduce stopping criteria , on the one hand , for the projected gradient algorithm and , on the other hand , for dykstra s algorithm . for the latter we use the robust stopping criterion introduced in @xcite and determined by a small number @xmath124 . for the former one can exploit the fact that the dual problem of the optimization problem eq .",
    ", which we identify as the primal problem , can be solved using the projected gradient algorithm , too .",
    "note that the primal problem can be written as @xmath125 where we identify the matrices @xmath96 and @xmath23 with the vectors @xmath126 and @xmath127 such that @xmath128 .",
    "the hermitian matrices @xmath129 comprise the linear constraints dictated by the fermionic anti - commutator relations such that the matrix @xmath130 is an element of the affine set for all @xmath131 .",
    "the dual problem of eq .",
    "is then for the dual variable @xmath132 @xcite @xmath133 note that the constraints of the dual problem force the solution @xmath134 to lie both in the positive semi - definite cone and in the affine set given by the linear equations .",
    "the intersection of these two convex sets is again convex and the dual problem becomes @xmath135 where @xmath136 denotes the intersection of the positive semi - definite cone with the set given by the linear constraints @xmath137 .",
    "finally , lemma [ lemma : gradientprojection ] shows that the projected gradient algorithm can be applied to solve the dual problem as well .",
    "the benefit of the formulation as a primal - dual problem is that the solution of the dual problem is a lower bound on the solution of the primal problem .",
    "hence , solving the primal and dual problems simultaneously using the projected gradient algorithm provides us with an ingenious certificate for the accuracy of the solution .",
    "consequently , one way to introduce a stopping criterion for the projected gradient algorithm is to initiate a small quantity @xmath138 and stop the computations when @xmath139 where @xmath140 is basically the dual function up to a constant .",
    "note that eq .",
    "is equivalent to the duality gap of the primal and dual problem and that for strictly feasible primal problems , i.e. for optimization problems of the form eq .",
    "for which there exists an @xmath141 such that @xmath142 , the duality gap is zero if evaluated at optimal points  @xcite . for the optimization problem eq .",
    ", one can easily find a point in the feasible set which is strictly feasible .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath143 , where @xmath144 and @xmath134 are solutions of the primal and dual problems , respectively , and hence eq . suits perfectly as a stopping criterion . due to the numerical cost to solve the primal and dual problems simultaneously , we decide on using a different stopping criterion for the projected gradient algorithm .",
    "we stop when the improvement per iteration step , i.e. @xmath145 falls below a predetermined small number @xmath146 .",
    "we implemented both routines for systems considering only second moments and numerical experiments suggest that for a sufficiently small number @xmath147 the latter stopping criterion yields results that are as good as in the primal - dual formalism .",
    "another degree of freedom in the formulation of the algorithm is the step length @xmath148 .",
    "numerical examples propose that for the first step in the direction of the negative gradient @xmath148 should be chosen to be large .",
    "for the remaining steps the computational cost could be reduced by choosing a small but appropriate value of @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "in the remainder of this work , we provide a number of numerical examples that demonstrate that the proposed method can be applied to rather large systems and is capable of extracting accurate information concerning the ground state energy as well as the correlation functions .",
    "the purpose of what follows is not to improve lower bounds on unknown ground state energies , but rather to analyse the behaviour of the proposed algorithm for finite but large lattice models .",
    "we begin our exposition of the numerical application of the algorithm with a simple , exactly solvable model for which the relaxation of the energy minimization problem has been analysed in great detail exploiting different numerical methods in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian we are considering as a first application of the projected gradient algorithm is given by @xmath149 where the operators describe spinless fermions .",
    "the ground state of this model coincides with that of the ising model in a transverse magnetic field with periodic boundary conditions @xmath150 when @xmath151 and @xmath5 is even .",
