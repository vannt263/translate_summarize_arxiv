    "in addition , the signals are clearly present in a region of @xmath43 ( up to 0.2v ) around the peak position .",
    "we conclude that the inelastic signals are only present when the fermi - level position is tuned to gate values where electron transmission resonances are present .",

    "[ tbl : damping ] we for comparison list the damping due to electronic friction , @xmath47 , calculated from the method described in ref .  .",

    "it is notable large for mode m5 and can for a few modes ( m3 , m6 ) be on the same order of magnitude as the phonon friction .",
    "a few modes with a strong coupling to the current also obtain a large phonon friction relative to the electronic friction , i.e. m1 and m7 .",
    "interestingly , we find that @xmath47 decreases with @xmath41 since the electronic structure away from the resonance comes into play . as a consequence the electronic friction may play a more dominant role as broadening near a resonance , while it can be tuned with the applied bias voltage . in a previous study we calculated the current - induced forces and heating in the gnc system .",
    "we note that the modes here giving the largest iets signal in the current are different from the modes which we have found to yield a highly nonlinear heating at bias voltages above 0.4v , and which are related to a current - induced and can give rise to negative electronic friction for certain `` run - away '' modes@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : biasandchargeiets ] we include the self - consistent electronic structure obtained at a finite bias and an electrostatic gate .",

    "here , we focus on the main signal near resonance .",
    "increasing the bias voltage in the dft - negf simulation ( @xmath56v and @xmath57 ) , and hereby including the potential drop in the electronic structure , introduces a slight shift in the signal position with respect to @xmath40 , but does not influence its magnitude . changing the charge of the system separately ( @xmath58v and @xmath59 )",
    "is observed to move the location of the signal almost 0.2ev . including both charge and bias voltage ( @xmath56v and @xmath59 ) does to some extend break the symmetry of the iets signals but the magnitude and the dominating modes are unaffected .",
