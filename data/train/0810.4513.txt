    "the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda ) was constructed at the amundsen - scott south pole station over a period of years , reaching completion in 2001 .",
    "the completed detector operated independently until 2006 .",
    "amanda s primary goal was the discovery of high energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources , in the energy range of roughly 100 gev to 100 pev .",
    "as a first - generation instrument , amanda served as a proof of concept and prototype for later neutrino telescopes such as icecube .",
    "neutrinos are detected by amanda when they undergo either charged - current ( cc ) or neutral - current ( nc ) interactions with nucleons in the ice .",
    "muon neutrino cc interactions produce a secondary muon which may travel kilometers through the ice .",
    "neutral - current interactions and cc electron neutrino events produce hadronic or electromagnetic showers of particles near the interaction vertex but no long track . in either case",
    ", the secondary particles are detected via cherenkov radiation by a sparse three - dimensional array of photosensors embedded in the extremely transparent polar ice cap ( optical attenuation length @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the final detector configuration , known as amanda - ii , consisted of 677 optical modules ( oms ) deployed on 19 strings at depths of roughly 1500 m ",
    "2000 m below the surface of the ice sheet .",
    "each optical module consisted of an 8  photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) contained within a glass pressure vessel .",
    "the om received hv power from the surface , and returned pmt signals amplified by a gain of @xmath1@xmath2 to the surface over either electrical or fiber optic cable .",
    "the strings were arranged in concentric circles , with an outermost radius of 100 m , resulting in an instrumented volume of approximately 15 mton of ice .",
    "after seven years of successful operation , amanda was incorporated into the second - generation icecube neutrino telescope , now half complete .",
    "independent operation thus ceased after the 2006 data run , with a total accumulated exposure of 3.8 years after accounting for detector maintenance periods and deadtime in the data acquisition system .",
    "the flux of atmospheric neutrinos produced by decaying @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons in cosmic ray air showers in the earth s atmosphere constitutes a background to searches for astrophysical neutrinos , but is also a useful calibration source for amanda .",
    "this flux is known to a precision of about 30% in the energy range to which amanda is sensitive @xcite .",
    "neutrinos can be identified within the flux of penetrating cosmic ray muons by searching for muon tracks originating from below the horizon ; these upgoing muons must have been produced by neutrino interactions .",
    "the amanda measurement of the atmospheric muon neutrino energy spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : atmnu ] , using data taken over the four year period 20002003 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical bands include the systematic uncertainties due to our modeling of the detector and the propagation of light through the ice . because the muons that are detected are produced in neutrino interactions at some distance from the detector , the energy of the incident neutrino is not directly measured , but must be inferred from the observed muon energy and the known energy loss rate for muons traversing ice and rock .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino spectrum is thus statistically unfolded from the observed muon spectrum , leading to the correlated statistical error bars on the points in fig .",
    "[ fig : atmnu ] .",
    "the measurement illustrates that the response of the detector to muon neutrinos is well understood , although the precision is insufficient at present to distinguish theoretical models .",

    "contours and best fit point in flux ( @xmath5 ) and spectral index ( @xmath6 ) of the atmospheric neutrino flux obtained from one simulated analysis of the seven year data set.,height=230 ]    the fact that the observed spectrum is consistent with the predictions for the atmospheric flux at low energies allows us to place a limit on the magnitude of any possible diffuse muon neutrino flux with a harder spectrum than the conventional atmospheric flux , for example due to the prompt decays of charmed leptons in atmospheric air showers or to a population of unresolved astrophysical sources .",
    "that limit is indicated with the red bars shown in the highest energy bins of fig .  [",
    "fig : atmnu ] .",
    "results from the full seven year data set will be available soon ; the expected precision of the atmospheric flux measurement from that study , derived from analysis of a single simulated data set based on the bartol flux @xcite , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atmnu_7yr ] .",
    "in addition , the very large number of atmospheric neutrinos detected by amanda can be used to search for evidence of physics beyond the standard model , such as quantum decoherence or violations of lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "these phenomena would appear as oscillation - like behavior , but at higher energies than standard neutrino oscillations and with very different characteristic flavor signatures .",
    "the primary goal of amanda is the detection of individual astrophysical sources of high energy neutrinos .",
    "we have conducted an unbinned maximum likelihood search for point sources of neutrinos , using a sky map of 6,595 upward going neutrino events collected over seven years @xcite .",

    "the true significance was assessed by repeatedly randomizing the right ascension of each event to create pure background maps , with any possible real sources smeared out across the sky . in 95% of such maps , a point with at least @xmath12 was found , indicating that such a level is consistent with statistical fluctuations of the background .",

    "amanda s search is complementary to those conducted by direct detection experiments because such experiments mainly constrain models with spin - independent neutralino - nucleon scattering , whereas neutralino capture in the sun allows us to probe models where the coupling is primarily spin - dependent @xcite .",
