    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) is by now well confirmed @xcite .",
    "the recent cosmological observations have helped to establish the concordance cosmological model where the present universe consists of about 68.3% dark energy , 26.8% dark matter and 4.9% atoms @xcite .",
    "understanding the nature of dark matter is one of the most challenging problems in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the dm direct detection experiments may observe the elastic scattering of dm particles with nuclei in detectors .",
    "current and future dm direct search experiments may constrain or discover the dm for its mass @xmath0 and elastic scattering cross section @xmath1 with nucleon . as well as in the dm direct detection , the dm particles can also elastically scatter with nuclei in the sun .",
    "then they may lose most of their energy and are trapped by the sun @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the dm solar capture rate @xmath2 is related to the dm - nucleon elastic scattering cross section @xmath1 . due to the interactions of the dm annihilation products in the sun",
    ", only the neutrino can escape from the sun and reach the earth .",
    "therefore , the water cherenkov detector super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite , the neutrino telescopes icecube ( ic ) @xcite and antares @xcite can also give the information about @xmath0 and @xmath1 through detecting the neutrino induced upgoing muons .",
    "the current experimental results about @xmath1 are based on the standard dm - nucleus contact interaction which is independent of the transferred momentum @xmath3 and the dm velocity @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , many dm scenarios can induce the momentum and velocity dependent dm - nucleus interactions .",
    "for example , the differential scattering cross section of a long - range interaction will contain a factor @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the mass of a light mediator @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the current experimental results about @xmath1 must be recalculated for the momentum and velocity dependent dm - nucleus interactions . in view of this feature , many authors have recently used the momentum and velocity dependent dm - nucleus interactions to reconcile or improve the tension between the dama annual modulation signal and other null observations @xcite .",
    "the new upper limit on @xmath1 can directly affect the maximal @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , we have to recalculate @xmath2 for a fixed @xmath1 when the dm - nucleus interaction is dependent on the momentum and velocity . for the usual contact interaction , the current direct search experiment xenon100 @xcite",
    "provides a more stringent limit on spin - independent ( si ) @xmath1 than the super - kamiokande and icecube experiments when @xmath8 gev @xcite . we do not know whether this conclusion still holds for the momentum and velocity dependent dm - nucleus interactions .",

    "the dm velocity distribution function @xmath21 in the galactic frame is usually assumed to be the maxwell - boltzmann distribution with velocity dispersion @xmath22 km / sec , truncated at the galactic escape velocity @xmath23 km / sec . in the earth s rest frame",
    ", we can derive @xmath24 where @xmath4 is the dm velocity with respect to the earth and @xmath25km / sec is the earth s speed relative to the galactic halo .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the contribution of the earth s orbit velocity to @xmath26 has been neglected since we do not focus on the annual modulation . with the help of @xmath27 ,",
    "one can obtain the maximum dm velocity @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the angle between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for a given recoil energy @xmath18",
