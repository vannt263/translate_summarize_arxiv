    "we believe that stars are born with a circumstellar disk .",
    "the formation of the circumstellar disk is coupled with `` the angular momentum problem '' that is a serious problem in the star formation process , and the dynamics of disks may determine the mass accretion rate onto the protostar that determines the final stellar mass .",
    "in addition , planets are considered to form in the circumstellar ( or protoplanetary ) disk , and their formation process strongly depends on disk properties such as disk size and mass .",
    "thus , the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk can provide a significant clue to star and planet formation .",
    "stars form in molecular clouds that have an angular momentum @xcite .",
    "thus , the appearance of a circumstellar disk is a natural consequence of the star formation process when the angular momentum is conserved in the collapsing cloud core .",
    "in addition , observations have shown the existence of circumstellar disks around the protostar ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "numerous observations indicate that circumstellar disks around class i and ii protostars have a size of @xmath6au and a mass of @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , they correspond to phases long after their formation . because the formation site of the circumstellar disk and protostar are embedded in a dense infalling envelope , we can not directly observe newborn or very young circumstellar disks ( and protostars ) .",
    "thus , we only observe the circumstellar disks long after their formation , i.e. , around the class i or ii protostar phase .    observations also indicate that a younger protostar has a massive circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite observed a massive disk with @xmath8 around class 0 sources , indicating that this massive disk can be present early in the main accretion phase .",
    "however , unfortunately , observation can not determine the real sizes of circumstellar disks , and how and when they form .",
    "therefore , we can not understand the formation process of the circumstellar disk by observations .",
    "the theoretical approach and numerical simulation are necessary to investigate the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk .",
    "theoretically , the star formation process can be divided into two phases , i.e. , the early collapse phase and main accretion phase .",
    "the molecular cloud cores that are star cradles have a number density of @xmath9 . in the early collapse phase",
    ", the gas in the molecular cloud core continues to collapse until the protostar formation at @xmath10 .",
    "the protostar at its formation has a mass of @xmath11 that corresponds to the jovian mass @xcite . in the main accretion phase",
    ", the protostar acquires almost all its mass by the gas accretion to reach @xmath12 . in this paper",
    ", we define ` the early collapse phase ' as the period before the protostar formation , while ` the main accretion phase ' is defined as the period until the gas accretion onto the protostellar system ( protostar and circumstellar disk ) almost halts after the protostar formation . in general",
    ", it is considered that the circumstellar disk gradually increases its mass and size in the main accretion phase that is successively connected from the early collapse phase .",
    "thus , to understand the formation and early evolution of circumstellar disks , we should consider both the early collapse and main accretion phases ; we need a self - consistent calculation from the collapse of the molecular cloud core until the end of the main accretion phase through the protostar formation .",
    "however , to investigate the formation and evolution of circumstellar disks in numerical simulations , we need a very long - term calculation with a sufficient spatial resolution , in which we should calculate the evolution of the protostellar system at least for the time comparable to the freefall timescale of the initial cloud core , i.e. , @xmath13yr after the protostar formation .",
    "in addition , we should resolve spatial scale length down to at least @xmath14au . reflecting the thermodynamics of the collapsing gas , two nested cores with a typical spatial scale appear in the early collapse phase @xcite .",
    "the inner core ( so - called the second adiabatic core ) corresponds to the protostar that has a size of @xmath15 , while the outer core that is called the first ( adiabatic ) core has a size of @xmath16au ( for details , see  [ sec : typical1 ] ) .",
    "@xcite expected that the circumstellar disk originates in the first core formed in the early collapse phase .",
    "thus , to investigate the formation of the circumstellar disk , we have to resolve the first core spatially ; we need a spatial resolution of @xmath17au at least . moreover , we need a three dimensional calculation to properly treat the angular momentum transport in the circumstellar disk",
    ".    so far , many studies of star formation in the collapsing cloud mainly focused only on the early collapse phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to investigate the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk",
    ", we have to calculate the early collapse and subsequent main accretion phases .",
    "however , since such calculation requires a huge amount of cpu time , only a few studies reported the formation of the circumstellar disk in the collapsing cloud core including the main accretion phase .",
    "@xcite investigated the formation of the circumstellar disk with sub - au resolution under the isothermal approximation , and showed frequent fragmentation of the disk .",
    "@xcite also studied the circumstellar disk formation in the collapsing cloud core with a slightly coarser spatial resolution of @xmath18au approximating the radiative cooling with adiabatic equation of state , and showed properties of the circumstellar disk .    in this study , using three - dimensional simulation adopting a barotropic equation of state with a higher spatial resolution than in previous studies , the evolution of the unmagnetized collapsing cloud cores is investigated until the gas accretion onto the protostar and circumstellar disk almost halts . in three dimensions , we first calculate the evolution of the circumstellar disk by the end of the main accretion phase . although the circumstellar disk formation in the collapsing cloud may be investigated with a radiation - hydrodynamics code , it is very difficult to execute such a calculation even with current supercomputers because it takes a huge amount of cpu time .",
    "thus , to trace the gas thermodynamics , we chose a barotropic equation of state that is used even in recent two - dimensional simulations of the circumstellar disk formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the framework of our models and the numerical method are given in  2 .",
    "the numerical results are presented in  3 .",
    "we discuss the fragmentation condition of the circumstellar disk and implication of the planet formation in  4 , and summarize our results in  5 .",
    "to study the evolution of collapsing gas clouds and circumstellar disks , we solve the equations of hydrodynamics including self - gravity : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 denote the density , velocity , pressure , and gravitational potential , respectively .",

    ", we adopt the central density of @xmath30 and isothermal temperature of @xmath31k . for these parameters ,",
    "the critical be radius is @xmath32au . to promote the contraction",
    ", we increase the density by a factor of @xmath33=1.68 , where @xmath33 is the density enhancement factor that represents the stability of the initial cloud . with @xmath34 ,",
    "the initial cloud has ( negative ) gravitational energy twice that of thermal energy .",
    "thus , the central density of the initial sphere is @xmath35 , while the ambient density is @xmath36 .",
    "we add @xmath37-mode non - axisymmetric density perturbation to the initial core .",
    "then , the density profile of the core is described as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the density distribution of the critical be sphere , and @xmath40 is the axisymmetric density perturbation . for the @xmath37-mode",
    ", we chose @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( = 0.01 ) represents the amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "the radial dependence is chosen so that the density perturbation remains regular at the origin ( @xmath43 ) at one time - step after the initial stage .",
    "this perturbation ensures that the center of the gravity is always located at the origin .",
    "the mass within @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "the gravitational force is ignored outside the host cloud ( @xmath46 ) to mimic a stationary interstellar medium .",
    "initially , the cloud rotates rigidly with angular velocity @xmath47 around the @xmath48-axis .",
    "we parameterized the ratio of the rotational to the gravitational energy ( @xmath49 ) inside the initial cloud . with different @xmath49 , we calculated 10 models .",
    "model names , initial angular velocities @xmath47 , and @xmath49 are summarized in table  1 .    in the collapsing cloud core",
    ", we assume protostar formation occurs when the number density exceeds @xmath50 at the cloud center . to model the protostar",
    ", we adopt a sink around the center of the computational domain . in the region @xmath51au ,",
    "gas having a number density of @xmath50 is removed from the computational domain and added to the protostar as a gravity in each timestep ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "this treatment of the sink makes it possible to calculate the evolution of the collapsing cloud and circumstellar disk for a longer duration .    to calculate over a large spatial scale ,",
    "the nested grid method is adopted ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each level of a rectangular grid has the same number of cells of @xmath52 .",
    "the calculation is first performed with five grid levels ( @xmath53@xmath54 ) .",
    "the box size of the coarsest grid @xmath53 is chosen to be @xmath55 .",
    "thus , a grid of @xmath53 has a box size of @xmath56au .",
    "a new finer grid is generated before the jeans condition is violated .",
    "the maximum level of grids is restricted to @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 grid has a box size of 96au and cell width of 0.75au . with this method",
    ", we cover five orders of magnitude in spatial scale .",
    "we investigated the cloud evolution and the circumstellar disk formation with different initial rotational energies , @xmath49 .",
    "observations have shown that the molecular cloud cores have @xmath59 with the mean value of @xmath60 @xcite . in the following section ,",
    "we show the cloud evolution and formation process of the circumstellar disk for two typical models ( model 6 and 3 ) .",
    "then , we compare the properties of circumstellar disks in clouds with different rotational energies .        figures  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] show the time sequence around the center of the cloud before ( panels _ a _ and _ b _ ) and after ( panels _ c _ - _ f _ ) the protostar formation for the model with @xmath62 ( model 6 ) . as denoted in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , we define the protostar formation epoch ( @xmath63 ) as the time when the maximum density reaches @xmath64 . in these figures ,",
    "the time after the protostar formation ( @xmath65 ) and protostellar mass ( @xmath66 ) are described in each panel .",
    "the protostellar mass @xmath66 is derived as the mass falling into the sink .",
    "panels _ a _ and _ b _ in these figures indicate the formation of the disk - like structure before the protostar formation . to clearly define the disk",
    ", we used the ratio of the radial to azimuthal velocity @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the density distribution ( _ a _ ) , the ratio of the radial to azimuthal velocity ( _ b _ ) , and the distribution of the radial ( _ c _ ) and azimuthal ( _ d _ ) velocities against the distance from the protostar along the @xmath69-axis . in figure",
    "[ fig:3 ] , these values for four different epochs corresponding to panels _ b _ , _ c _ , _ e _ and _ f _ of figures  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] are plotted .",
    "comparison of figures  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] with figure  [ fig:3 ] _ a _ indicates that the shock front corresponds to the disk surface .",
    "thus , the disk - like structure is enclosed by the shock . in figure",
    "[ fig:3]_a _ , fine structures inside the shock surface at @xmath70yr and at @xmath71yr correspond to spiral density waves .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] ( _ c _ ) shows a sudden rise of the radial velocity at the shock front .",
    "in addition , figure  [ fig:3]_d _ shows a large azimuthal velocity inside or near the shock front ( i.e. , inside or near the disk ) .",
    "figures  [ fig:3]_c _ and _ d _ indicate that the gas rapidly falls into the center of the cloud with a slow rotation outside the disk , while the radial velocity slows and azimuthal velocity dominates inside the disk .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the radial to azimuthal velocity shows a sudden drop at the disk surface as shown in figure  [ fig:3]_b_. note that , in figure  [ fig:3]_b _ , to stress the disk surface , the velocity ratio @xmath67 inside the disk is not displayed . as a result ,",
    "the velocity ratio @xmath67 is a good indicator to specify the disk .    in this paper , to determine the disk , we estimated the velocity ratio @xmath67 ( @xmath72 ) in each cell , and specified the most distant cell having @xmath73 from the center of the cloud .",
    "then , we defined the disk radius @xmath74 as the distance of the cell furthest from the origin , and the disk boundary density @xmath75 as the density of the most distant cell . finally , we defined the disk that has a density of @xmath76 .",
    "thus , in our definition , the region inside the rapid drop of @xmath67 corresponds to the disk in figure  [ fig:3]_b_. comparison of figure  [ fig:3]_b _ with figures  [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3]_a _ indicates this definition of the disk well corresponds to a real size of the disk in simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows that a thick disk - like structure formed before the protostar formation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] _ a _ and _ b _ ) transforms into a sufficiently thin disk after the protostar formation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] _ c _  _ f _ ) . as described in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , theoretically , the star formation process can be divided into two phases : the early collapse phase ( or the early phase of the star formation ) and the main accretion phase ( or the later phase of the star formation ) .",
    "the early collapse phase was investigated in detail by @xcite and @xcite . here",
    ", we briefly describe this .",
    "after the gas collapse is initiated in the molecular cloud core , the collapsing gas obeys the isothermal equation of state with temperature of @xmath77k for @xmath78 ( isothermal phase ) . then cloud collapses adiabatically ( @xmath79 ; adiabatic phase ) and quasi - static core ( i.e. , first core ) forms during the adiabatic phase .",
    "after central density reaches @xmath80 , the equation of state becomes soft reflecting the dissociation of hydrogen molecules at @xmath81 k , and the gas collapses rapidly again , i.e. , the second collapse begins . finally , when the gas density reaches @xmath82 , the gas collapse stops and the protostar ( or the second core ) forms . at this epoch",
    ", the early collapse phase ends and the main accretion phase begins . in the main accretion phase , @xcite expected that the first core without the angular momentum disappears in @xmath83yr after the protostar formation , while @xcite pointed out that the first core having the angular momentum does not disappear in such short duration because the first core is supported by the rotation .",
    "thus , we can expect that the rotating first core formed in the early collapse phase becomes the circumstellar disk in the main accretion phase . in the main accretion phase",
    ", the gas with the angular momentum continues to accrete onto the first core ( or the circumstellar disk ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] clearly shows that the first core becomes the circumstellar disk in the main accretion phase ; the first core is a precursor of the circumstellar disk .",
    "the region enclosed by the shock in figure  [ fig:1]_a _ and figure  [ fig:2]_a _ corresponds to the first core that is formed after the gas becomes adiabatic .",
    "figures  [ fig:2]_b_-_e _ show that the first core ( or the circumstellar disk ) gradually becomes thin with time .",
    "finally , a sufficiently thin disk appears as shown in figure  [ fig:2]_f_. figure  [ fig:3]_b _ shows that the disk has a radius of @xmath77au before the protostar formation .",
    "the disk extends up to @xmath84au for @xmath85yr in the main accretion phase .",
    "in addition , 89% of the total mass ( i.e. , 89% of the initial host cloud mass ) accretes onto the protostar and circumstellar disk system by this epoch ( @xmath86yr , see table  1 ) .    in summary , when we defined the circumstellar disk as the rotating disk around the protostar , the circumstellar disk with a size of @xmath87au is already formed before the protostar formation .",
    "this disk size at the protostar formation corresponds to that of the first core with rotation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the circumstellar disk has a minimum size of @xmath0au which implies that we can not observe a disk with @xmath88au even around very young protostars .    as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , fragmentation occurs and two clumps form in the circumstellar disk @xmath89yr after the protostar formation . at the fragmentation epoch ,",
    "the protostellar mass is @xmath90 , while the disk mass is @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the disk is 1.8 times more massive than the protostar .",
    "as shown in @xcite and @xcite , at the protostar formation epoch , the protostar only has a mass of @xmath92 that corresponds to jovian mass .",
    "this jovian mass protostar acquires its mass by the gas accretion for @xmath93yr to reach the solar mass object . on the other hand ,",
    "the first core has a mass of @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the mass of the protostar and first core correspond to the jeans mass at their formation epoch .",
    "figures  [ fig:1][fig:3 ] show that the first core evolves directly into the circumstellar disk through the early collapse to the main accretion phases .",
    "thus , during the early main accretion phase , the circumstellar disk is more massive than the protostar , as described in @xcite .",
    "since such a massive disk is gravitationally unstable , fragmentation tends to occur @xcite . in this model , at the end of the calculation , each fragment is gravitationally bound , and has a mass @xmath95 with @xmath96au of the separation between the central protostar and fragment .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the time sequence for the model with @xmath97 ( model 3 ) .",
    "similar to the model with @xmath61 ( model 6 ) , this model also shows the disk - like structure ( i.e. , disk - like first core ) preceding the protostar formation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]_a _ ) . owing to the larger initial angular momentum",
    ", the first core in model 3 ( @xmath98 ) has a flatter structure than that in model 6 ( @xmath62 ) . for this model , at the protostar formation epoch",
    ", the protostar has a mass of @xmath99 , while the disk has a mass of @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the disk is about 100 times more massive than the protostar .",
    "nevertheless , the circumstellar disk shows no fragmentation , as seen in figure  [ fig:4]_b _ - _ d_. instead , the spiral structures appear with the gravitational instability in the circumstellar disk .",
    "the circumstellar disk extends up to @xmath101au ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5]_d _ ) by the epoch at which the almost all gas in the host cloud has accreted onto the protostar and circumstellar disk system . by this epoch , the masses of protostar and circumstellar disk reach @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "thus , even at end of the main accretion phase , the circumstellar disk is more massive than the protostar .",
    "the disk properties and fragmentation condition are discussed in  [ sec : dis1 ] .      in this section , to investigate the disk properties , four different models with different initial rotational energies @xmath49 are presented .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the density and velocity distribution for models with @xmath97 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 at @xmath107yr after the protostar formation . since the freefall timescale at the center of initial cloud is @xmath108yr , they are structures at @xmath109 after the protostar formation .",
    "the figure shows a larger disk with larger @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , two clumps formed by fragmentation due to the gravitational instability appear in the circumstellar disk for models with @xmath61 and @xmath105 , while no clump appears by the end of the main accretion phase for models with @xmath97 and @xmath106 .",
    "the fragmentation condition depends on the size and mass of the circumstellar disk ( see ,  [ sec : dis1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows the evolution of the disk mass before ( left panel ) and after ( right panel ) the protostar formation for the same models in figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the figure indicates that the rotating disk forms before the protostar formation ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) and has a mass of @xmath111 at the protostar formation epoch . after the protostar forms",
    ", the circumstellar disk gradually increases its mass by gas accretion , and reaches @xmath112 by the end of the main accretion phase .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the circumstellar disk during the main accretion phase ( @xmath5yr ) is @xmath113@xmath114yr@xmath26 .",
    "this rate is determined by the balance between the mass accreting onto the circumstellar disk and mass infalling onto the protostar .",
    "figure  [ fig:7]_a _ plots a time sequence of the residual mass @xmath115 for the same models in figure  [ fig:5 ] , where @xmath116 is the initial mass of the host cloud ( i.e. , the mass inside @xmath117 in the initial cloud ) .",
    "the figure shows that the residual mass rapidly decrease in a freefall timescale and reaches @xmath118 in @xmath5yr .",
    "thus , about 90% of total mass accretes onto the protostar and circumstellar disk system by this epoch",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] , the cloud with a larger @xmath49 has a larger ( or massive ) rotating disk . in such a disk , the mass accretion onto the protostar is suppressed owing to larger angular momentum , and a less massive protostar appears with a relatively smaller protostellar accretion rate .",
    "figure  [ fig:8 ] shows the disk - to - protostellar mass ratio @xmath124 against the protostellar mass for the same models in figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the figure indicates that the circumstellar disk mass exceeds protostellar mass at the protostar formation epoch even for the model with a considerable small rotational energy .",
    "the cloud with larger rotational energy has a relatively massive circumstellar disk at the protostar formation epoch .",
    "for example , the circumstellar disk for model with @xmath125 is about 100 times more massive than the protostar ( @xmath126 ) , while for the model with @xmath127 it is twice as massive ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "the circumstellar disk is more massive than the protostar for most of the main accretion phase , exception for the model with @xmath127 .",
    "in addition , the circumstellar disk mass is comparable to the protostellar mass even at the end of the main accretion phase for models with @xmath129 .",
    "moreover , even in a cloud with @xmath127 whose value is much smaller than the average of the observation @xmath130 @xcite , the circumstellar disk has a 1/10 ( @xmath131 ) of the protostellar mass at the end of the main accretion phase .",
    "figure  [ fig:7]_c _ plots the evolution of the circumstellar disk radius after the protostar formation .",
    "the figure shows that the circumstellar disk with the radius of @xmath132au already exists at the protostar formation epoch ( i.e. , @xmath133 ) .",
    "the size of the circumstellar disk increases with time , and reaches @xmath134au by the end of the main accretion phase .",
    "the figure also indicates that the protostar has a larger circumstellar disk for the cloud with larger @xmath49 .",

    "however , in any model , the aspect ratio decreases with time and reaches @xmath146 by the end of the main accretion phase .",

    "since gas clouds have temperatures of @xmath31k ( @xmath152 ) , the accretion rate in the main accretion phase is @xmath153 .",
    "thus , the accretion rate derived in our calculations corresponds well to the theoretical expectation .",
    "however , the accretion rate shows strong time variability as the protostellar and circumstellar mass increases .    as seen in figure",
    "[ fig:9 ] , for models with @xmath143 , the accretion rate monotonically decreases initially , while it strongly fluctuates with time later as the protostellar ( or circumstellar ) mass increases .",
    "in addition , models with @xmath154 show a strong time variability of the accretion rate right after the protostar formation .",
    "this time variability stems from spiral arms or clumps caused by the gravitational instability in the circumstellar disk .",
    "the epoch at which the accretion rate begins to fluctuate corresponds to the formation epoch of the spiral arm or clump .",
    "for example , for model with @xmath62 , the accretion rate shows a slight time variability when @xmath155 ( see , fig .",

    ", we estimated @xmath158 and @xmath169 in each cell inside the disk ( for detailed description , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . then , these values are averaged within the whole disk to roughly estimate the time variability of them .",
    "note that although we may have to check local values of @xmath158 and @xmath170 , not global ( or averaged ) values to investigate the disk stability and fragmentation @xcite , we use global values to roughly estimate the time sequence of the disk stability .    as shown in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , the circumstellar disk originates from the first core that is formed in the early collapse phase .",
    "the first core is formed after the gas becomes adiabatic in the collapsing cloud core .",
    "thus , the first core is mainly supported by the thermal pressure gradient force at its formation . even when the initial host cloud has a significant rotational energy , the rotational energy of the first core is , at most , only 10% of the gravitational energy @xcite .",
    "then , the gas having a larger angular momentum accretes onto the disk ( the first core or circumstellar disk ) from the outer envelope as time goes on , and the disk gradually thins owing to the centrifugal force , and spreads to a large extent . thus , it is considered that @xmath158 increases with time , because the gas with the larger specific angular momentum accretes onto the circumstellar disk with time ; the epicyclic frequency or the ratio @xmath171 is expected to become large with time .",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] left panel plots a time sequence of the averaged @xmath158 .",
    "the figure shows that , for any model , @xmath158 is much less than unity ( @xmath172 ) at the protostar formation epoch and increases with time ( or the protostellar mass ) . finally , it reaches order unity @xmath173 by the end of the main accretion phase in any model .",
    "the figure also shows that the circumstellar disk has a smaller @xmath158 in the cloud with smaller rotational energy .",
    "this is because , for the model with smaller @xmath49 , the gas with smaller specific angular momentum forms a disk .    in general",
    ", fragmentation can occur in the rotating disk with @xmath167 .",
    "however , for the model with @xmath97 , although the circumstellar disk has @xmath167 when the protostellar mass is less than @xmath174 , fragmentation does not occur , as shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "this is because the disk radius is smaller than the critical jeans length ( @xmath175 ) when @xmath174 . on the other hand , for this model , the disk radius is larger than the critical jeans length @xmath168 when protostellar mass is larger than @xmath176 , while fragmentation does not occur because q parameter exceeds unity @xmath177 in this phase . as a result , by the end of main accretion phase , this model shows no fragmentation , while the spiral structure appears as shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] .    for the model with @xmath61 ,",
    "the circumstellar disk keeps @xmath167 for @xmath178 , and the ratio @xmath170 manages to reach @xmath168 in this period .",
    "therefore , fragmentation occurs to form two clumps as shown in figures  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] . even in the model with @xmath179 ,",
    "these two conditions ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) are fulfilled for @xmath180 , and fragmentation occurs . on the other hand",
    ", the model with @xmath181 has @xmath167 through the main accretion phase , while fragmentation does not occur .",

    "figure  [ fig:5 ] implies that the upper border of the rotational energy between fragmentation and non - fragmentation models exists in models between @xmath97 and @xmath104 . to determine the fragmentation condition in more detail , we show the final fate for models @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 in figure  [ fig:11 ] .",
    "the figure indicates that fragmentation border exists in models between @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",

    "note that , for this model , we stopped calculation long before the end of main accretion phase ( @xmath188yr ) because fragments move outwardly and the jeans criterion is violated .",
    "this model shows fragmentation in the early main accretion phase of @xmath189yr ( see , table  1 ) , because a sufficiently large disk is already formed in the early collapse phase ( i.e. , before the main accretion phase ) .",
    "moreover , the model with @xmath190 shows fragmentation in the early collapse phase ( i.e. , before the protostar formation , see , table  1 ) . the fragmentation process in the early collapse phase was reported in many past studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in summary",
    ", the fragmentation condition derived in our simulation can be described as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath191 : fragmentation in the early collapse phase , 2 .",
    "@xmath192 : fragmentation in the main accretion phase , 3 .",
    "@xmath193 and @xmath194 : no fragmentation .",
    "although models having parameters of @xmath194 show no fragmentation , these models may show fragmentation in subsequent evolution stages . as listed in table  1 , the mass of the circumstellar disk for no fragmentation models is comparable to the protostellar mass at the end of the main accretion phase , in which toomre s @xmath158 is nearly unity @xmath173 .",
    "such a disk can fragment to form several clumps when the cooling time scale is shorter than the kepler rotational timescale in the protoplanetary disk @xcite . in this study",
    ", we adopted a barotropic equation of state that makes the direct disk calculation from the molecular cloud until the end of the main accretion phase possible . in the main accretion phase",
    ", the mass of the circumstellar disk overwhelms the protostellar mass with @xmath195 .",
    "in such a situation , it is expected that the cooling process is not so important for fragmentation . instead , to investigate a marginal stable disk with @xmath196",
    ", the cooling process may be important @xcite .",
    "ideally , we should investigate the circumstellar disk formation from the molecular cloud core with a radiative hydrodynamics , while we need to wait for further development of computational power to perform such calculations .",
    "however , we can expect that fragmentation in the circumstellar disk generally occurs because a massive circumstellar disk inevitably appears in the star formation process .      as described in  [ sec : dis1 ] , a massive circumstellar disk inevitably appears in the main accretion phase .",
    "this is because the first core that is a precursor of the circumstellar disk is about @xmath4 times more massive than the protostar , reflecting the thermodynamics of the collapsing gas .",
    "such a massive disk tends to show fragmentation owing to the gravitational instability @xcite . in our calculation , many models showed fragmentation and formation of small clumps in the circumstellar disk .",
    "as listed in table  1 , at the end of the calculation , fragments have a mass of @xmath197 with a separation of @xmath198au . for every model , fragments survived without falling into the central protostar .",
    "although the masses of fragments exist in the range of the brown dwarf ( @xmath199 ) , the planet - mass object may appear in the subsequent star formation phase , in which it is expected that the circumstellar disk cools to form less massive clumps @xcite . in this study",
    ", we calculated the evolution of the circumstellar disk until the main accretion phase ends from the prestellar core phase .",
    "however , further long - term calculations including an adequate radiative effect with a higher spatial resolution are necessary to properly investigate the mass and separation of fragments .",
    "since such calculation is beyond the scope of this study , we qualitatively , not quantitatively , discuss the planet formation in the subsequent evolution phase of the circumstellar disk below .",
    "recently , brown dwarf or planet mass companions have been observed .",
    "@xcite observed a brown - dwarf mass companion around gq lup with separation of @xmath83au . in 2008 , direct images of planet mass companions around fomalhaut @xcite and hr8799 @xcite are shown , in which they have masses of @xmath200 with separations of @xmath201au .",
    "it is considered that there are two different ways to form planets in the circumstellar ( or protoplanetary ) disk : one is the core accretion model @xcite , the other is the gravitational instability model @xcite . in the core accretion scenario , it is difficult to account for the formation of massive planet in the region far from the protostar ( @xmath202au ) in the standard disk model @xcite . on the other hand , a massive planet can form even in the region far from the protostar by fragmentation due to gravitational instability when the disk is sufficiently massive . in this study",
    ", we showed that , in the circumstellar disk , gravitationally bound clumps can form in the region of @xmath203au .",
    "in addition , our calculation indicates that the massive circumstellar disks comparable to or more massive than the protostar form in the main accretion phase when the rotational energy of the molecular cloud is comparable to the observations ( @xmath204 , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the gravitational instability scenario may be more common for the planet formation .      in this study , we ignored the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field plays an important role in both the early collapse and main accretion phases , and is related to the formation process of the star and circumstellar disk .",
    "for example , a large fraction of the cloud mass is blown away by the protostellar outflow that is driven by the lorentz force from the circumstellar disk .",
    "thus , the protostellar outflow is expected to be closely related to the star formation efficiency @xcite .",
    "the protostellar outflow is also related to the determination of the circumstellar disk mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , in the circumstellar disk , the turbulence owing to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contributes to the angular momentum transfer that is related to the mass accretion rate onto the protostar .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field suppress fragmentation @xcite and the formation of the disk @xcite .",
    "however , even when the molecular cloud is strongly magnetized , the mass of the first core and protostar is , respectively , @xmath205 and @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "thus , as in the case of an unmagnetized cloud , the circumstellar disk mass overwhelms the protostellar mass at the protostar formation epoch .",
    "this is because the mass and size of each object ( first core and protostar ) are determined by the thermodynamics of the collapsing gas @xcite . in the main accretion phase ,",
    "however , the masses of the circumstellar disk and protostar in magnetized clouds may be different from those in unmagnetized clouds because the angular momentum is transferred by the magnetic effect such as magnetic braking , protostellar outflow and mri .",
    "we will investigate the circumstellar disk formation in a magnetized cloud in detail in a subsequent paper .",
    "to investigate the circumstellar disk formation and its properties , we calculated the evolution of the unmagnetized molecular clouds from the prestellar core phase until the end of the main accretion phase going through the protostar formation , using three - dimensional nested - grid simulation that covers both whole region of the initial molecular cloud and sub - au structure .",
    "we constructed 10 models with a parameter of the initial cloud s rotational energy ( @xmath49 ) , in which the size ( @xmath207au ) and mass ( @xmath208 ) of the initial molecular cloud are fixed , and calculated their evolution until about 90% of the host cloud mass accretes onto either protostar or circumstellar disk ( i.e. , until the end of the main accretion phase ) .",
    "the following results are obtained :    * _ the first core is a precursor of the circumstellar disk .",
    "_ in the collapsing cloud core , the first core forms at @xmath209 with a size of @xmath0au before the protostar formation . at its formation ,",
    "the first core exhibits a thick disk - like configuration with aspect ratio of @xmath210 .",
    "then , after the protostar formation , the first core gradually transforms into a considerably thin disk ( @xmath146 ) that corresponds to the circumstellar disk .",
    "thus , the minimum size of the circumstellar disk ( or the size of the youngest circumstellar disk ) is @xmath0au that corresponds to the size of the first core at its formation .",
    "the circumstellar disk is mainly supported by the thermal pressure gradient force in the early collapse and early main accretion phases , and then it is mainly supported by the centrifugal force and becomes very thin in the later main accretion phase because the gas with a large angular momentum accretes onto it .",
    "* _ the circumstellar disks are massive than the protostars throughout most of the main accretion phase . _",
    "the first core has a mass of @xmath94 , while the protostar has a mass of @xmath92 at its formation .",
    "the mass of each object almost corresponds to the jeans mass at its formation .",
    "the first core evolves directly into the circumstellar disk .",
    "thus , at the protostar formation epoch , the circumstellar disk is inevitably more massive than the protostar : the circumstellar disk is about @xmath4 times more massive than the protostar .",
    "after the protostar formation ( i.e. , in the mass accretion phase ) , the gas accretes onto the protostar through the circumstellar disk .",
    "since a part of the accreting gas accumulates in the disk , not only the protostellar mass but also the circumstellar mass increases .",
    "the mass growth rate of the protostar is larger than that of the circumstellar disk in the main accretion phase .",
    "nevertheless , the circumstellar disk is more massive than the protostar throughout the main accretion phase , reflecting the large initial mass ratio between the protostar and circumstellar disk at their formation .",
    "* _ the planet and brown - dwarf mass objects tend to appear owing to the gravitational instability of the circumstellar disk in the main accretion phase .",
    "_ since the circumstellar disk is massive than the protostar throughout the main accretion phase , the gravitational instability inevitably occurs in such massive disk . in the cloud with initially moderate rotational energy ( @xmath211 )",
    ", fragmentation occurs in the circumstellar disk to form several clumps that have a mass of @xmath212 with a separation of @xmath213au from the protostar . on the other hand , in the cloud with initially larger rotational energy ( @xmath214 ) ,",
    "fragmentation does not occur , but spiral patterns appear in the main accretion phase .",
    "whether fragmentation or spiral arms appear depends on growth of the disk : fragmentation can occur when a sufficiently larger disk ( @xmath215 ) has sufficient mass ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "however , because the circumstellar disk not showing fragmentation in the main accretion phase has a mass comparable to the protostar , fragmentation may occur in later phase of the disk evolution , in which the disk cools and becomes more unstable again .",
    "* _ the mass accretion rate onto the protostar shows strong time variability in the main accretion phase . _",
    "after low - mass ( planet or brown - dwarf mass ) objects appear in the circumstellar disk , the mass accretion rate onto the protostar shows a strong time variability , because low - mass objects effectively transfer the angular momentum outwardly to promote gas accretion onto the protostar . on the other hand ,",
    "there is little time variability of the accretion rate in a cloud with considerably lower rotation energy ( @xmath127 ) in the initial state .",
    "in such a model , since neither clumps nor clear spiral patterns appear in the circumstellar disk , the angular momentum transport is not so effective in the present modeling without magnetic field .",
    "thus , the variability of the accretion rate provides a useful signature for detecting the low - mass companions or exo - planets around very young protostars .",
    "our results imply that , in the star formation process , the planet and brown - dwarf mass objects frequently appear in the circumstellar disk , indicating that the gravitational instability scenario may be a major pass for the planet formation .",
