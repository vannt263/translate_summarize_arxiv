    "to isolate the effect of bubble deformability we have carried out several simulations of many buoyant bubbles rising in a turbulent upflow in a vertical channel , where the only aspect that we change between the different runs is the surface tension .",
    "the computational domain is a rectangular channel bounded by two flat vertical walls .",
    "the channel is periodic in the spanwise and the streamwise direction .",
    "the flow is driven upward by a specified pressure gradient .",
    "the dimensionless numbers in the problem are reynolds number , @xmath0 , eotvos number , @xmath1 , and density and viscosity ratios .",
    "the pressure gradient and eotvos number are specifies _ a priori _ and the reynolds number is calculated from the average velocity _ a posteriori_. eotvos number is decreased from 4.5 to 0.9 .",
    "the decrease in the deformability of bubbles reduces the flow rate and causes the reynolds number to drop from 3750 to 1700 ."
