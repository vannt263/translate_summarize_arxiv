    "the c - axis josephson plasma resonance ( jpr ) in highly anisotropic layered cuprate superconductors originates from the interlayer tunneling of cooper pairs .",
    "measurements of the jpr in these josephson - coupled layered systems have received much interest in recent years due to its direct relation to the london penetration depth along the c - axis , @xmath8 .",
    "the jpr , @xmath9 = c/@xmath10 = c/@xmath11 is thus a fundamental probe of the superconducting state and an excellent tool to study these highly anisotropic systems .",
    "here @xmath12 is the high frequency dielectric constant along the c - axis , and @xmath13 is the anisotropy parameter . for t@xmath14t@xmath0",
    ", the temperature dependence of @xmath8 is related to the symmetry of the order parameter . for t close to t@xmath0 ,",
    "the appearance of the jpr probes the onset of interlayer phase coherence .",
    "furthermore , the jpr spectral width is a measure of the quasiparticle scattering rate , if intrinsic .",
    "in addition , the jpr probes the tunneling mechanism and provides information about the validity of the interlayer tunneling model @xcite . in a magnetic field ,",
    "the jpr probes the correlation of pancake vortices along the c - axis and is a tool to study the b - t phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using terahertz time - domain spectroscopy ( thz - tds ) to map out the phase diagram is that this technique allows measurements to be made over a broad frequency range at fixed magnetic field and temperature .",
    "the terahertz regime is very important because it overlaps both the jpr and the quasiparticle scattering rates of high - t@xmath0 superconductors with extreme anisotropy such as the bismuth , thallium , and mercury based high - t@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "earlier jpr experiments include microwave cavity experiments on bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 at a fixed frequency on the order of 30 - 90 ghz utilizing the fact that the microwave absorption resonance peak can be tuned by temperature and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "while these measurements demonstrate the existence of the jpr and are useful in probing the system over a narrow range of temperatures and fields , the pancake vortices from the required magnetic field alter the system .",
    "recently , gaifullin et .",
    "@xcite overcame this shortcoming and probed the vortex system of underdoped bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 in a microwave guide by sweeping the frequency continuously from 20 to 150 ghz at constant magnetic field and temperature .",
    "however , in order to measure the jpr of less anisotropic high-@xmath3 superconductors such as the thallium , and mercury compounds , optical techniques are needed .",
    "tsvetkov et .",
    "@xcite used a grazing angle reflectivity technique and measured the jpr in tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cuo@xmath15 and tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 thin films to be @xmath4840 ghz and @xmath4780 ghz , respectively , for t@xmath14t@xmath0 in zero field .    in this paper we present experimental data of the c - axis jpr in tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 as a function of temperature in zero field",
    "the jpr is observed at 705@xmath55 ghz at 10 k and decreases with increasing temperature to @xmath4170@xmath515 ghz at 98 k corresponding to a c - axis penetration depth increasing from 20.1@xmath50.6 @xmath6 m to 84@xmath59 @xmath6 m .",
    "we also observe an increase in the jpr spectral width with increasing temperature , indicative of an increase in the quasiparticle scattering rate .",
    "the jpr vanishes above t@xmath0 as expected .",
    "measuring the jpr in transmission improves the signal / noise ratio allowing measurements of the jpr and its linewidth closer to t@xmath0 than previous measurements performed in reflection @xcite .",
    "the onset of the jpr is observed at @xmath40.95t@xmath0 .",
    "the experiments were performed using thz - tds in transmission with a bandwidth covering approximately 0.2 - 2.5 thz .",
    "the details of the experimental setup are discussed in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 film ( 700 nm ) was grown on a 10mm@xmath1610 mm mgo substrate in a two - step process .",
    "first an amorphous tbcco film is deposited by laser ablation . next it is annealed at high temperature in oxygen to form the 2212 phase .",
    "it exhibits a sharp transition ( 0.2 k width ) at a temperature of 103.4 k.    in order to excite the c - axis jpr a component of the electric field ( e - field ) of the terahertz pulse has to be along the c - axis of the sample . the plasma frequency along the ab - plane is close to the metallic regime @xmath41.5 ev , while the jpr along the c - axis lies in the terahertz range .",
    "therefore , by tilting the sample at an angle , @xmath17 incident p - polarized thz radiation will be transmitted at the jpr when there is an e - field component parallel to the c - axis and completely reflected when the e - field is parallel to the ab - plane .",
    "the anisotropic dielectric function can be written as , @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath9 are the in - plane and out - of - plane plasma frequencies , respectively . assuming @xmath20 , and not taking into account dissipation and c - axis dispersion effects @xcite , we find that electromagnetic waves can only propagate in a narrow window above the plasma edge , @xmath21 it is a well known fact that the electromagnetic wave in an anisotropic media does not have a pure transverse character , but also has a longitudinal component .",
    "the configuration of our sample with respect to the terahertz beam is shown in fig .",
    "p - polarized thz radiation , incident at an angle of 45@xmath22 to the surface normal , is transmitted through the sample . in order to minimize the effect of the substrate ,",
    "two sets of averaged scans are performed at each temperature .",
    "the first set on the sample , film plus substrate , and the other set on a bare reference substrate .",
    "the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the sample is then divided by the fft of the reference .",
    "this gives the complex transmission coefficient of the film as a function of frequency .",
    "2(a)-(d ) shows the electric field amplitude of the terahertz pulse in the time domain transmitted through the sample at different temperatures .",
    "2(a ) shows the terahertz pulse transmitted through the sample at 110 k , above the onset of superconductivity . at 90 k , fig .",
    "2(b ) , the onset of c - axis coherent tunneling is just perceptible as a slight oscillation following the main pulse .",
    "this damped ringing will show as a broad jpr peak in the frequency domain ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , where the damping is due to quasiparticle scattering .",
    "lowering the temperature to 70 k , fig .",
    "2(c ) , the terahertz pulse displays an even stronger oscillation due to a reduction in scattering .",
    "this results in a narrowing of the jpr peak ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . the terahertz pulse at 10 k , fig .",
    "2(d ) , displays a pronounced ringing lasting for at least 20 ps following the main pulse .",
    "these fraces reveal how the oscillation frequency increases as the temperature is lowered resulting in a shifting of the jpr to higher frequencies .",
    "3 shows the transmission amplitude as a function of frequency for the tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 film for different temperatures .",
    "it clearly illustrates the temperature dependence of the jpr , appearing as a sharp peak at @xmath4705 ghz to 680 ghz for low temperatures ( 10 k to 40 k ) and decreasing with temperature to @xmath4170 ghz at 98 k. the jpr vanishes close to 99 k which is about 4 k below t@xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "the spectral width of the jpr peak increases with temperature , indicative of an increase in the quasiparticle scattering rate .",
    "the appearance of the jpr as a peak , at the resonance in the transmission spectrum , agrees with the electromagnetic analysis , where propagation of the electromagnetic wave occurs only in a narrow window above the plasma edge .",
    "the decrease in the jpr frequency with temperature is consistent with a decreasing superconducting electron density on approaching t@xmath0 from below .    at 10",
    "k the half - width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of the jpr is @xmath445 ghz .",
    "it increases with temperature to @xmath480 ghz at 95 k. this data can not be used to consistently determine the c - axis conductivity due possible to experimental artifacts or effects of c - axis dispersion neglected in equation ( 1 ) for @xmath23 .",
    "the temporal scans of the thz pulses are terminated at 20 ps in order to eliminate the effect of the first fabry - perot reflection due to the 1 mm mgo substrate .",
    "this might cause an additional broadening of the jpr peaks in fig .",
    "3 in the temperature range 10 k to 40 k.    taking , @xmath12=11.3@xmath50.5 for the high frequency dielectric constant for the electric field along the c - axis @xcite , we obtain for the c - axis penetration depth , @xmath8(10k)=20.1@xmath50.6 @xmath6 m , and @xmath8(98k)=84@xmath59 @xmath6 m . similar results were obtained on a 600 nm tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 film grown on lao substrate ( t@xmath0=105 k ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the jpr frequency is plotted in fig .",
    "it displays the same behavior as the tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 film on mgo substrate just with a higher lying jpr due to a slight difference in the anisotropy .",
    "here we obtain for the c - axis penetration depth , @xmath8(10k)=18.2@xmath50.5 @xmath6 m ( @xmath24780@xmath55 ghz ) , and @xmath8(90k)=31.6@xmath51.4 @xmath6 m ( @xmath24450@xmath510 ghz ) .",
    "to summarize , we have applied thz - tds to measure the c - axis jpr in tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 as a function of temperature .",
    "these measurements agree well with previous measurements on tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 , using a grazing angle reflectivity technique @xcite and we have been able to extend the measurements to temperatures approaching t@xmath0 .",
    "we have probed the onset of the c - axis phase coherence to @xmath40.95t@xmath0 .",
