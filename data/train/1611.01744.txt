    "electron capture ( ec ) on nuclei plays a crucial role in high density astrophysical environments and determines many processes such as @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis @xcite , heating @xcite and cooling of the accreting neutron star crust @xcite , thermonuclear explosions of accreting white dwarfs and explosive nucleosynthesis @xcite , the late stage evolution of massive stars @xcite and core - collapse ( cc ) supernovae @xcite .    in particular , during late stage",
    "stellar evolution ec is responsible for a number of important phenomena .",
    "first , it reduces the pressure provided by the degenerate relativistic electron gas in order to balance gravitation .",
    "it also cools the core by producing neutrinos which , for mass densities smaller than about @xmath3 g/@xmath4 ( which corresponds to baryon number densities , @xmath5 , of about @xmath6 @xmath7 ) leave the star unhindered .",
    "finally , ec determines the star s composition via the electron - to - baryon ratio @xmath8 , equal to the proton fraction @xmath9 due to charge neutrality .",
    "@xmath10 denotes here the charge density .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) averaged ec rates strongly depend , in the late stages of pre - bounce evolution of the central element of a collapsing star , on the experimentally unknown binding energies of nuclei far beyond the stability valley . by controlling the evolution of @xmath11 and @xmath12 shell gaps in neutron - rich nuclei , we have shown that nuclear abundances can be strongly modified . as a consequence",
    ", the average ec rate may increase up to 30% .",
    "this study already underlined the need of additional experimental measurements and/or microscopic calculations at the neutron - rich edge of the known isotopic table .",
    "total ec rates are not only influenced by the nuclear distribution , but by the rates on individual nuclei , too .",
    "this aspect was recently addressed in ref .",
    "core collapse simulations were performed , considering a huge variety of progenitor models and several different equations of state ( eos ) .",
    "individual ec rates were thereby systematically scaled by factors ranging from 2 to 10 with respect to the fiducial values taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and the analytic parameterization of ref .",
    "the mass of the inner core at bounce and the maximum of the neutrino luminosity peak were found to augment ( diminish ) by 16% ( 4% ) and , respectively , 20% when the ec rates are scaled by a factor of 0.1 ( 10 ) .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the modification of ec rates affects much more strongly the bounce properties than the progenitor model or the eos .",
    "the results of the simulations were found to be most sensitive to a possible reduction in the ec rates for neutron rich nuclei near the @xmath13 = 50 closed shell .",
    "this finding is very interesting for future experiments with exotic beams .",
    "this pedagogical study has clearly shown how much the lack of reliable information on ec rates on the relevant neutron - rich nuclei can impact the dynamics of core collapse . however , a global modification of all ec rates by a common factor  the same for all nuclei and all thermodynamic conditions  is clearly not realistic . therefore , awaiting for more detailed microscopic calculations , it is timely to try to understand the different physical effects entering the ec rates in order to better control them outside the region where calculations constrained by experimental data are available . to this aim , instead of arbitrarily varying individual rates as in ref.@xcite",
    ", we try here to obtain some hints on their physical behavior at high electron density , temperature and isospin ratio from the trends observed in the region covered by microscopic calculations .",
    "specifically we extend the existing analytic parameterizations in several ways to incorporate different physical effects and improve the reliability of the extrapolation to regions not covered by microscopic calculations .",
    "we shall show that these improved parameterizations can lead to a reduction of the average ec rate with respect to previous estimations . over a certain density domain ,",
    "the reduction factor is as high as one order of magnitude , which corresponds to the maximum reduction considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to illustrate our findings",
    ", we will consider here some typical thermodynamic conditions .",
    "they are taken from two different core collapse trajectories reported in ref .",
    "they correspond to the pre - bounce evolution of the central element of the star with an enclosed mass of 0.05 solar masses , for two progenitors , a @xmath14 and a @xmath15 one  @xcite .",
    "similar to our previous work , see ref .",
    "@xcite , the modified ec rates will be added perturbatively .",
    "this means that we neglect for this exploratory work the influence of the modified rates on the time evolution of baryon number density @xmath5 , temperature @xmath16 and proton fraction @xmath17 throughout the collapse .",
    "consequently , our quantitative predictions contain some uncertainties , and we can not exclude that a consistent use of improved ec rates in a full core collapse simulation would produce a smaller effect than the one shown in the present work .",
    "however , qualitatively , our results are robust and the observed effect is large enough such that we expect in any case that it will have non - negligible impact on the dynamics of the collapse .    given the thermodynamical conditions , we will evaluate the chemical composition of matter and in particular nuclear abundances via the extended nse model of ref .",
    "experimental nuclear masses @xcite supplemented by predictions of the 10-parameter mass model of duflo and zuker @xcite will be used .",
    "ec rates are calculated based on an analytic parameterization proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , fitted on large scale shell model calculations of @xmath0-shell nuclei  @xcite .",
    "three refinements of the original parameterization will be proposed : the average gamow - teller ( gt ) transition energy @xmath18 will be first allowed to depend on temperature and electron density , second on isospin , and finally , on the odd - even character of individual nuclei .",
    "these latter dependencies are inspired by the isospin asymmetry and odd - even dependence of the gt@xmath19-resonance , shown by both experimental data and theoretical calculations ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "information on the thermodynamic conditions of the considered core collapse trajectories and the corresponding matter composition are given in section  [ sec : thermo ] .",
    "the different prescriptions for the calculation of ec rates are discussed in section  [ sec : ecrates ] .",
    "the resulting ec rates averaged over the nuclear distributions obtained from the nse along the considered trajectories are presented in section  [ sec : average ] . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the present work .",
    "and @xmath20 one , from ref.@xcite . baryon number density ( a ) and temperature ( b ) are plotted as a function of the electron density @xmath21 . the grid on panel ( b ) indicates the temperature - electron density grid of the tables for weak interaction rates from ref .",

    "the pre - bounce evolution of a collapsing star follows a complicated trajectory in the @xmath16 , @xmath5 and @xmath22 space in response to different physical processes , including weak interactions .",
    "however , according to the theory of adiabatic collapse @xcite , the central part of the core is expected to collapse homologously , meaning that the central densities and temperatures should manifest a more or less universal pattern taken as function of @xmath8 , as confirmed by detailed numerical simulations @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermo ] , we show the thermodynamic conditions at the center of the star during infall , resulting from two simulations  @xcite with two different progenitors , a 15 @xmath23 and a 25 @xmath23 one .",
    "the central element within these spherically symmetric simulations corresponds to an enclosed mass of 0.05 @xmath23 .",
    "weak interactions rates have thereby been determined from a simple nse matter composition together with rates taken from refs .",
    "@xcite , see ref .  @xcite . on panel ( b ) , the electron density - temperature grid of the weak interaction data base of ref .",
    "@xcite is represented as well .",
    "it is obvious that the highest electron densities reached during infall lie outside the grid domain and the temperatures , @xmath16 , are situated in a region where the mesh is sparse .",
    "[ fig : nseresults ] offers complementary information on the considered trajectories .",
    "it shows , as a function of the baryon number density , the baryonic and total energy per baryon ( panel ( a ) ) , entropy per baryon ( panel ( b ) ) and pressure ( panel ( c ) ) as obtained within the extended nse model of ref .",
    "we can see that the slight progenitor dependence exhibited by the temperature evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thermo](b ) ) is somewhat amplified in other thermodynamic variables , notably the entropy per particle .",
    "this is due to the fact that these quantities strongly depend on the matter composition , which depends exponentially on temperature .",
    "thus , even if the inner core evolves homologously , some progenitor dependence remains within the thermodynamic conditions and we will keep thus both trajectories for the discussion within this paper .",
    "the matter composition along the two trajectories was investigated in detail in ref .",
    "it was shown in particular that the distributions of nuclei are broad at all times , and that individual nuclei become more neutron rich subsequently to the deleptonisation and decrease in @xmath17 of the whole system .",
    "nuclei with a mass number @xmath24 ( called `` heavy '' hereafter ) bind an important amount of matter , even if their mass fraction decreases as the collapse advances and the temperature rises .",
    "in addition , if binding energies of nuclei are described by a model with strong shell gaps far from stability , as the dz10 model  @xcite , the nuclear distributions are characterized by a competition between the @xmath12 and @xmath11 magic numbers @xcite .",
    "the first systematic study of weak interaction rates under stellar conditions is due to fuller , fowler and newman . in a series of papers published in the 80s , they pointed out the particular role played by the gt giant resonance for both electron capture and @xmath25-decays , and parameterized its contribution based on an independent particle model @xcite .",
    "the resulting reaction rates for nuclei with mass numbers between 21 and 60 , considered of chief importance in astrophysics , were made available in tabulated form  @xcite .",
    "analytic parameterizations , where structure and phase space contributions are factorized , were proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , too .",
    "it is well known since these pioneering works that capture rates on heavy nuclei dominate the capture probability , though lighter nuclei can not be neglected @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the probability of capturing an electron is trivially hindered for large and negative reaction q - value , defined as @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 denotes here the mass of a nucleus with @xmath28 protons and @xmath29 neutrons , and @xmath30 is the electron mass .",
    "the @xmath31-value gives the relevant energy scale of the capture process at constant electron energy .",
    "light nuclei , for which few stable isobars exist , have in general very low @xmath31-values . for @xmath0-shell nuclei around @xmath32 ,",
    "the nuclear chart starts to widen and the @xmath31-value increases .    of course",
    ", lower @xmath31-values might be compensated by higher abundances such that in an astrophysical situation still light nuclei may dominate .",
    "therefore , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : iq ] , the average @xmath31-value , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 representing the abundance per unit volume of the nucleus with @xmath35 nucleons and @xmath28 protons , versus the average isospin asymmetry throughout the ccsn trajectories of ref .",
    "nuclear abundances have been calculated within the extended nse model of ref .  @xcite as detailed in the previous section .",
    "light nuclei ( @xmath36 ) are labeled by filled dots and heavy nuclei ( @xmath37 ) by open dots .",
    "the errors bars indicate the width of the nuclear distributions .",
    "it is obvious that for the considered thermodynamic conditions within the collapse phase of a ccsn , heavy nuclei systematically have larger average @xmath31-values and , therefore , higher ec rates .",
    "the widening of the region of nuclear stability also implies that higher values of the average isospin asymmetry @xmath38 can be reached for heavier nuclei . as expected from elementary considerations on nuclear stability , and clearly visible on fig .",
    "[ fig : iq ] , @xmath39 decreases with increasing neutron richness .",
    "furthermore , due to the competition among @xmath13-magic numbers @xcite , wide distributions characterize heavy fragment production under all thermodynamic conditions .",
    "light clusters , defined on a quite limited mass domain , show a very large variation with isospin , too .",

    "the evaluation of ec rates for heavy nuclei demands accurate microscopic calculations beyond the simple independent particle picture employed in the first theoretical works .",
    "indeed , a clear experimental evidence exists that the gt strength is quenched with respect to single particle expectations , and fragmented over several states at low excitation energies in the daughter nucleus .",
    "the best theoretical description presently available is offered by large scale shell model calculations , able to account for all correlations among the valence nucleons in a major shell .",
    "so far such tabulations exist only for @xmath43- ( @xmath44 ) @xcite and @xmath0-shell nuclei ( @xmath45 ) @xcite , for the same temperature - electron density grid previously considered in refs .",
    "a full diagonalization of the shell model hamiltonian is not yet feasible for open shell neutron - rich nuclei with @xmath46 , which dominate electron capture for densities larger than @xmath47 g/@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "calculations exist employing alternative approaches , such as rpa @xcite or qrpa @xcite . in general , these are less accurate than shell - model calculations  @xcite since it is not clear whether all correlations are correctly included .",
    "an interesting and accurate hybrid approach has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where rpa calculations have been performed with occupation numbers taken from shell model monte - carlo calculations .",
    "globally , theoretical evaluations of electron capture rates , resumed in the available microscopic  @xcite or empirical  @xcite databases , do , however , neither cover all necessary nuclei nor are the grids in temperature and electron density dense and extended enough for a complete description of ec during core collapse .",
    "for this reason , the use of analytic parameterizations appears as an appealing compromise @xcite .",

    "@xcite , @xmath56 and @xmath57 mev , are shown to give a good overall qualitative reproduction of the microscopically calculated ec rates for the thermodynamic conditions explored by the central element before bounce @xcite .    however , the microscopic calculations show a large dispersion , and deviations in individual rates of one order of magnitude or more are observed with respect to this simple prescription .",
    "in addition , only a limited number of nuclei is included in the adjustment , and therefore in practice the analytic parameterization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lec ] ) is extrapolated to much smaller @xmath31-values , needed for neutron rich nuclei , than those present in the fit .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that a modification in the ec rates for some key nuclei can have a considerable impact on core collapse . therefore",
    ", here we try to understand which is the major physical effect neglected in the simple parameterization , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lec ] ) , susceptible to improve the description of individual ec rates .",
    "this study could on the one hand lead to a more reliable parameterization based on existing microscopic data and on the other hand motivate microscopic calculations to put the parameterizations on a more firm ground .    to that end",
    "we will study four different generalizations of eq .",

    "we concentrate here on temperatures of the order of mev and the highest electron density values of the tables from ref .",

    "@xcite is a good first approximation .",
    "looking more in detail , the behavior of @xmath58 as a function of temperature ( panel ( c ) ) becomes more complex .",

    "let us first note that the higher @xmath51 , the less important become the details of nuclear structure . therefore scattering of the rates is reduced with increasing @xmath21 and the parameterizations better reproduce the data ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",

    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ec ] , too , that the dependence of the ec rates on @xmath31 considerably flattens with increasing temperature and electron density . as already observed in @xcite , this is due to the fact that the electron chemical potential increases with density much faster than the range of @xmath31-values explored by the most abundant nuclei , again reducing the dependence on the detailed strength distribution .",

    "we further allow for a linear @xmath63-dependence of @xmath18 , see appendix  [ app : fits ] for details .",
    "the overall agreement of the parameterization with the data is considerably improved , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ec ] and table  [ table : chi2 ] , even if at low temperatures noticeable deviations remain .",
    "this is due to the fact that the individual rates under these conditions depend on the details of the gt strength and it is thus not sufficient to reproduce global trends of the gt phenomenology",
    ".    a closer look at fig.[fig : ec ] reveals that the dispersion of the individual rates is partially due to the existence of strong odd - even effects , see also the discussion in ref .",
    "we therefore introduce a separate parameterization of the average transition energy parameter @xmath18 for odd - odd ( oo ) , even - even ( ee ) and odd - even ( oe ) nuclei , called model ( 3 ) , see appendix  [ app : fits ] for details .",

    "indeed the limited @xmath42 range covered by present shell model calculations ( @xmath64 ) makes it impossible to pin down the most appropriate functional trend . to demonstrate this statement , in model ( 4 ) we account for a quadratic dependence on isospin in addition to odd - even effects , see appendix  [ app : fits ] .",

    "[ fig : ec],[fig : residuals ] and table  [ table : chi2 ] .    to conclude , we have discussed here several physically realistic effects  @xcite susceptible to improve the description of microscopic ec rate calculations within a simple analytic parameterization .",
    "a possible dependence on temperature , electron density and isospin of the transition energy allow indeed for a better reproduction of data . upon inclusion of odd - even effects ,",
    "even the staggering of individual rates due to fluctuations in the gt strength distribution can be imitated .",

    "the significant reduction of ec rates on heavy nuclei with large negative-@xmath31 values , accounted for by the isospin dependent parameterizations , leads to a strong and almost systematic reduction of the associated average ec rate , see panel ( a ) . in the first stage of the collapse",
    "this reduction is independent of the choice for the isospin dependence but depends strongly on whether odd - even effects are included or not . at this stage ,",
    "nuclei with @xmath79 showing strong nuclear structure effects dominate ec explaining the sensitivity to odd - even effects .",
    "isospin dependence is weak , since the range of populated @xmath31-values is well constrained by microscopic data on @xmath0-shell nuclei . in the late stages of the collapse , when lower @xmath17 values are reached , the stronger isospin dependence in model ( 4 ) leads to a considerably stronger reduction of the average ec rate on heavy nuclei with respect to model ( 3 ) .",
    "the similarity between the predictions of models ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , for @xmath80 @xmath7 , shows that at high isospin asymmetries the isospin dependence dominates over structure details . as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : iq ] , which shows that heavy nuclei produced in the central element of the two collapsing cores populate the same @xmath31-value domain , the nse average ec rates on heavy nuclei shows little sensitivity to the progenitor mass .",
    "panel ( b ) analyses ec rates nse averaged over the whole nuclear distribution .",
    "it shows that , as long as , due to low temperatures , protons and light nuclei have low multiplicities , heavy nuclei clearly dominate ec .",
    "this corresponds to baryon number densities below roughly @xmath81 @xmath7 , where the mass fractions of protons and light nuclei do not exceed the percent level ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the late stages of infall ,",
    "when more protons and light nuclei are produced , a more moderate reduction of the overall rate is obtained .",
    "the progenitor dependence of @xmath82 is due to the progenitor dependence in the matter composition . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the mass fraction bound in heavy nuclei is higher in the core of the progenitor with the smaller mass . therefore higher deviations with respect to the fiducial model are obtained for the @xmath14 progenitor than for the @xmath15 one .",
    "we recall that models ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) provide an equivalent fit to the available microscopic calculations and only differ in their extrapolation towards the extremely neutron - rich regime .",
    "this means that the difference between the dashed and the dotted curves in fig.[fig : avec ] can be considered as a measure of the present uncertainty due to unknown rates on extremely neutron rich nuclei .    a correct extrapolation beyond the region covered by the shell - model ec tables available in the literature",
    "can only be done by confronting the predictions of our different phenomenological parameterizations to reliable microscopic ec calculations for extremely neutron rich nuclei , for instance with dedicated qrpa calculations @xcite .",
    "if confirmed by microscopic calculations , this reduction of the ec rate on neutron rich nuclei in hot and dense environments would translate into higher electron fractions and entropies of the inner core together with increased masses at bounce and higher maxima of the neutrino luminosity peak  @xcite .",
    "we note that the reduction of the averaged ec rates observed in this paper is opposite to the growth discussed in ref .  @xcite due to an expected magicity quenching towards the drip - line . which is the dominant effect , which nuclei play the most important role and what exactly are the consequences on a core collapse trajectory are questions which can only be answered by core collapse simulations treating consistently nuclear abundances , individual ec rates , and neutrino dynamics .",
    "this task is beyond the present paper .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the role played by ec on neutron rich nuclei , abundantly produced in the late infall stages . to this aim",
    ", we have considered thermodynamic conditions corresponding to the trajectories of the central element , including a mass of 0.05@xmath83 , of two progenitors with 15@xmath83 and 25@xmath83 masses during collapse  @xcite .",
    "modifications of ec rates are considered perturbatively in this exploratory work , meaning that the time evolution of density , temperature and electron fraction is not modified while different prescriptions are considered for the ec rates .",
    "ec rates have been calculated according to an analytic parameterization inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite . specifically , we seek for an optimal reproduction of large scale shell - model calculations considering a possible temperature , density , and isospin dependence of the effective average transition energy @xmath18 .",
    "odd - even effects are also included and shown to considerably improve the agreement with the microscopic data . under the considered thermodynamic conditions , these new analytic parameterizations lead to an overall reduction of the nse - averaged ec rate of up to one order of magnitude .",
    "this would imply , in an astrophysical simulation , larger electron fractions and entropies in the inner core and a larger mass at bounce .",
    "though only an estimation due to the perturbative approximation of the present approach , the observed reduction of the ec rate is important enough to justify the effort for the calculation of accurate weak interaction rates on extremely neutron rich nuclei in hot and dense environments , constrained by new measurements of weak processes on exotic nuclei .",

    "as mentioned in the text , we have employed four different parameterizations of the electron capture rate . within this appendix",

    "we made a least - square fit of the ec tables of ref .",
    "@xcite at each grid point defined by a given value of temperature and electron density ( see fig.[fig : thermo ] ) . since @xmath55 gives only an overall normalization and does not change the functional dependence of the rate , we keep the fiducial value @xmath56 .",
    "conversely , we allow @xmath18 to depend on @xmath16 , @xmath21 and on the nuclear species , as it is physically reasonable to expect .    in model ( 1 ) , the dependence on individual nuclei is neglected , but the average transition energy @xmath18 is assumed to depend on the temperature and electron density .",
