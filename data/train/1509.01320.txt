    "recently , there has been much interest in the unusual magnetic and magnetotransport properties of 2-dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas ( 2deg ) at low densities , as exemplified by the inversion layers in silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor field effect transistors ( si - mosfets ) @xcite , or by gaas quantum wells .",

    "we note that within the general framework of delocalised - electron magnetism , an important benchmark is provided by stoner - type mean - field theories .",
    "the underlying assumption is the presence of a local repulsive interaction between opposite - spin electrons . in the case of a quasi-2deg , where an important role is played by long - range coulomb correlations , such an assumption does not at the first sight appear too realistic .",

    "[ fig : susce ] ( a ) is due to a broader spatial spread of higher - level wavefunctions ( which reduces both the effective 2d interaction and the wavefunction change under the effect of magnetic field ) .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : susce ] , variational results are presented for the single - level case only , as the required calculations become more cumbersome in the case of multiple occupied levels .",
    "so far , we found that the magnetic susceptibility @xmath59 increases with increasing density @xmath0 , with a transition to ferromagnetism deep inside the high - density metallic region .",
    "an important underlying assumption was that the in - plane carrier motion is free , which is no longer adequate for smaller densities close to mit .",
    "indeed , in this region the dominant role is played by the in - plane coulomb correlations , as indicated by the measure of the interaction strength , @xmath104 , exceeding unity .",
    "very recently , it has been suggested@xcite that the available data at low densities can be described by a phenomenological model of a 2d fermi gas with a renormalised in - plane mass : @xmath105 the pauli - like in - plane magnetic susceptibility would then be@xcite @xmath106 when @xmath0 approaches @xmath1 from above , @xmath107 increases because of the effective band narrowing , which does not necessarily imply a magnetic instability ( in agreement also with ref .",

    "further refinement can be obtained by using a more adequate variational _",

    "[ fig : dolgo ] ) .",
    "while the two follow each other rather closely in this regime , the numerical result for @xmath59 ( and hence for the density value at transition ) is larger than the variational one , mostly due to a pronounced difference between the exact transverse wavefunction and the variational one [ given by eq .",

    "as explained above , the transition is expected to be second - order . indeed ,",
    "numerical results imply that @xmath120 is continuous at the transition point , @xmath121 , and rapidly increases with decreasing density , reaching full spin polarisation at @xmath122 .",
    "full spin polarisation is then sustained in the region @xmath123 .    alternatively , taking into account the accuracy of experimental data",
    ", it appears possible that the actual mit takes place at the point @xmath124 , whereas @xmath1 , which enters eq .",
    "( [ eq : dolgo ] ) , plays the role of an asymptotically defined parameter ( a point where the effective mass would have diverged ) .",
    "we constructed a stoner - type theory of magnetism for electrons in an inversion layer , addressing both the behaviour of the system in the metallic high - density region and the correlated low - density regime immediately above the metal - insulator transition . while we specifically aimed at describing si-(100 ) mosfets , our results are expected to be qualitatively relevant for other 2d electron systems of finite thickness .",
    "these general conclusions are : ( i ) at higher densities , proper treatment requires taking into account the wave function change under the applied in - plane magnetic field ( see fig .",

    "this effect leads to an increased susceptibility in the paramagnetic state , and enhances the tendency toward ferromagnetism . as a result ,",

    "( ii ) even though the overall behaviour at low densities is dominated by long - range coulomb forces , the magnetic susceptibility can be significantly affected by the on - site carrier repulsion , which is of course always present .",
    "we close with a brief summary of our results for a silicon mosfet . in the high - density metallic regime , when one neglects the in - plane coulomb correlations ( main body of sec .",
    "[ sec : susce ] ) , the relaxation of the stoner criterion translates into a lower value of critical density corresponding to a ferromagnetic transition ( in comparison to the conventional stoner approach ) .",

    "<S> motivated by recent experimental work on magnetic properties of si - mosfets , we report a calculation of magnetisation and susceptibility of electrons in an inversion layer , taking into account the co - ordinate dependence of electron wave function in the direction perpendicular to the plane . it is assumed that the inversion - layer carriers interact via a contact repulsive potential , which is treated at a mean - field level , resulting in a self - consistent change of profile of the wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the results differ significantly from those obtained in the pure 2deg case ( where no provision is made for a quantum motion in the transverse direction ) . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the critical value of interaction needed to attain the ferromagnetic ( stoner ) instability is decreased and the stoner criterion is therefore relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an increased susceptibility and ultimately to a ferromagnetic transition deep in the high - density metallic regime . in the opposite limit of low carrier densities , </S>",
    "<S> a phenomenological treatment of the in - plane correlation effects suggests a ferromagnetic instability above the metal - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> results are discussed in the context of the available experimental data .    </S>",
