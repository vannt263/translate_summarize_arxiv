    "the born - oppenheimer ( adiabatic ) approximation @xcite , separating the calculations of the electronic and nuclear wavefunction , is one of the fundamental approximations in quantum chemistry .",
    "it , however , breaks down dramatically if two electronic surfaces are nearly degenerate , i.e. the energy difference is within the vibrational energy splitting @xcite . in this case , the two adiabatic electronic states change their characters rapidly when the nuclei move , and therefore non - adiabatic coupling is introduced .",
    "if the system has more than one nuclear degree of freedom , the two adiabatic surfaces will often intersect each other .",
    "in other words , the system will have a conical intersection @xcite .",
    "the presence of a conical intersection typically introduces new , dense spectral bands and hence changes the experimental observations , e.g. the photoelectron spectrum , dramatically @xcite .",
    "for instance , there is a `` mysterious '' band found in the energy range from 9.5 to 9.9 ev in the butatriene photoelectron spectrum @xcite .",
    "this mysterious band can be explained via a vibronic coupling hamiltonian , constructed from diabatic electronic basis and nuclear normal modes @xcite .",
    "similar situations can be found in other systems as well , e.g. in molecules like allene , benzene , pyrazine , and @xmath0 @xcite . besides",
    ", the existence of conical intersections provides a fast non - radiative relaxation channel , which can quench fluorescence @xcite or introduce molecular isomerization @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the vibronic coupling hamiltonian together with nuclear dynamics calculations has become the standard treatment of non - adiabatic coupling systems @xcite .",
    "for such a method , the total wavefunction ansatz is always written as _ a sum of products of electronic and nuclear wavefunction over all involved electronic states _",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are attemps to go beyond the usual born - oppenheimer approximation by forcing an exact factorization on the total wavefunction .",
    "namely , _ the total wavefunction is a single product of one electronic and one nuclear wavefunction _ @xcite . in the literature a non - rotating diatomic system ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) with only one vibrational mode ( 1d )",
    "was successfully studied @xcite .",
    "the most astonishing discovery from the 1d study is that such a wavefunction ansatz leads to a  spiky \" potential and a nodeless nuclear wavefunction @xcite .",
    "the only exception where the nuclear wavefunction can have a node is via symmetry , see ref .",
    "@xcite for an example .",
    "later studies focused on nuclear dynamics simulations with the exact factorized time - dependent potential of the 1d system @xcite .",
    "till now , features related to conical intersections , which requires the presence of at least two nuclear degrees of freedom @xcite , have never been studied with the exact factorized total wavefunction ansatz . in this paper",
    ", we will apply the single product wavefunction ansatz to a realistic two - mode system , namely butatriene , and discuss the origin of the spiky potential and its relation to the vibronic coupling effect .",
    "let us begin with introducing our system , which is a linear vibronic coupling model with diabatic electronic basis functions @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the normal modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , appearing in the diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements , are termed tuning mode and coupling mode , respectively .",
    "the normal mode frequencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the energies of the diabatic states @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the coupling constants @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 can be obtained via diabatizing the adiabatic potentials @xcite . diagonalizing the hamiltonian yields @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-th vibronic energy eigenvalue and @xmath18 the @xmath17-th vibronic eigenfunction .",
    "the total wavefunction for each vibronic eigenfunction then reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom , respectively . for the dynamics calculation ,",
    "the total wavepacket is a linear combination of many @xmath22 . here",
    "we will concentrate on the individual eigenfunction and refer to @xmath22 as our total wavefunction .    how to impose the single product condition on @xmath23 ?",
    "first , we can take a common part @xmath24 out of @xmath25 and @xmath26 and regroup everything else as one single electronic wavefunction @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath24 then represents the exact factorized nuclear wavefunction , or the exact nuclear wavefunction for abbreviation .",
    "therefore , the wavefunction ansatz now reads @xmath28 where the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 depend strongly on @xmath21 .",
    "the exact ( factorized ) electronic wavefunction @xmath27 , being a linear combination of diabatic electronic basis states @xmath31 , consequently also depends strongly on @xmath21 .",
    "the wavefunctions @xmath27 and @xmath24 are all normalized : @xmath27 is normalized at each nuclear geometry @xmath21 via integrating over all electronic degrees of freedom ( @xmath32 ) , while @xmath24 is normalized according to @xmath33 .",
    "still , the partitioning between @xmath27 and @xmath24 in eq .",
    "[ eq : wfansatz ] is not unique . in other words , there are many ways to choose @xmath24 . here",
    "we introduce one more condition on @xmath27 in order to achieve a unique partition , namely , we require @xmath24 to be real and positive so that @xmath29 and @xmath30 follow the sign of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this condition directly yields a nodeless @xmath24 , whose sign can never change in the whole nuclear space . following the normalization condition of @xmath27 ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "can now be chosen as @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37 , respectively .    inserting the wavefunction ansatz , eq .",
    "[ eq : wfansatz ] , and the total hamiltonian into the usual time - independent schrdinger equation , we arrive at a coupled eigenvalue problem of the exact wavefunctions @xmath27 and @xmath24 .",

    "interestingly , the exact electronic hamiltonian @xmath42 is different from the usual electronic hamiltonian @xmath43 and is given by @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is responsible for the non - adiabatic coupling , and @xmath46 is the index for the nuclei . according to eq .",
    "[ eq : hel ] , the nuclear motion now couples directly to the electronic motion , and hence one has to solve for @xmath27 and @xmath24 simultaneously . to be more precise",

    "there is one corresponding @xmath27 for each @xmath24 .",

    "[ eq : wfansatz ] , two different @xmath48 can not have the same @xmath49 , and thus the usual picture that one electronic state accommodates many different vibrational levels is no longer applicable .",
    "this is the price one pays for going beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation with a single product wavefunction .",
    "the advantage of this treatment is that the full correlation between electrons and nuclei is considered simultaneously , i.e. the molecular vibration is now also correlated with the electronic motion .    a straightforward simulation based on eqs .",
    "[ eq : workingeq1],[eq : workingeq2 ] is of course very expensive , but there is a shortcut for evaluating @xmath41 . with the form of @xmath49 as a linear combination of diabatic basis states , eq .",

    "a simple example is the adiabatic ground state eigenfunction .",

    "the latter still does not include the off - diagonal correction into the electronic state and yields only good nuclear wavefunction amplitudes but not the correct phase / sign .",
    "we also find that @xmath60 is a better approximation than the adiabatic approximation , i.e. yielding better energies and eigenfunctions than the adiabatic ones .",
    "this provides hope that one can employ wavepacket propagation simulations with a single electronic surface when the energy range of interest is suitable .",
    "finally , we mention that the spatial imaging of individual vibronic states is possible @xcite .    to conclude , we show for the first time a systematic approach to apply the exact factorization wavefunction ansatz to a conical intersection system .",
    "it allows us to investigate features like spiky potentials and nodeless nuclear eigenfunctions .",
    "simultaneously it brings us a deeper understanding of the adiabatic approximation , which yields a good modulus of the nuclear wavefunction , but not necessarily the correct phase / sign of the wavefunction , nor the correct ordering of the energy eigenvalues .",
