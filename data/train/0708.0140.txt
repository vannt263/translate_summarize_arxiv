    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are arguably the most accurate tools available for probing the expansion history of the universe , as their luminosities at maximum light can be calibrated to an uncertainty of @xmath1315% via several empirical relations between their luminosity and light / color curves ( wang et al .",

    "( 1999 ) were the first to propose that the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating ( for a review see , e.g. , filippenko 2005 ) .",
    "this remarkable result , which suggests that the universe is primarily composed of mysterious dark energy , was subsequently confirmed by more studies using sne  ia ( barris et al .",
    "2003 ; tonry et al . 2003 ; knop et al . 2003 ; riess et al . 2004 , 2007 ; astier et al . 2006 ; wood - vasey et al . 2007 ) , and by independent methods such as the power spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( e.g. , spergel et al . 2003 , 2007 ) and baryon acoustic oscillations ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2005 ) .    despite the success of using sne  ia as cosmological probes ,",
    "a disconcerting fact is that details of the properties of sn  ia progenitors and their environments remain poorly understood .",
    "it is generally believed that a sn  ia is produced by a carbon - oxygen ( c@xmath14o ) white dwarf ( wd ) accreting matter from a companion star in a binary system .",
    "however , the nature of the companion star in the binary system is still unclear : it could be a main - sequence star , a subgiant , or an evolved red giant ( nomoto , iwamoto , koshimoto 1997 ) , or even another degenerate c@xmath14o wd ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1985 ) .",
    "studying the absorption by dust toward sne  ia may provide a unique way to peer into their local environments and hence set constraints on the properties of their progenitor system .",
    "if the dust enveloping the sne is totally or partially produced by the progenitor evolution , the ratio of the total to selective absorption [ @xmath15 may differ from that of normal interstellar dust ( e.g. , wang l 2005 ) . moreover",
    ", accurate determination of the absorption toward a sn  ia helps establish the accurate luminosity required for precision cosmology .    several studies of global color fits to sne",
    "ia have suggested that the dust obscuring sne  ia in their host galaxies may differ from the dust observed in the milky way galaxy ( riess et al .",

    "our discussion and conclusions are given in  6 .",
    "sn 2006x was discovered independently on 7.10 february 2006 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) by s. suzuki and m. migliardi ( iauc 8667 ) , with j2000 coordinates @xmath19 = 12@xmath2022@xmath2153@xmath22.90 and @xmath23 = 15@xmath2448@xmath2532@xmath26.90 .",
    "it is @xmath27 w and @xmath28 s of the center of the nearby galaxy ngc 4321 ( m100 ) , a grand - design sbc galaxy in the virgo cluster having a cepheid distance of @xmath29 mag ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) . a spectrum of sn 2006x taken shortly after its discovery shows it to be an early sn  ia ( quimby et al .",
    "2006 ) , similar to that of sn 2002bo 12 weeks before maximum light ( benetti et al . 2004 )",
    "but with a redder continuum .",
    "our photometric observations of sn 2006x began on 2006 february 8.15 , @xmath1311 days before @xmath8-band maximum .",
    "data were obtained with three telescopes : the 0.80  m thca - naoc telescope ( tnt ) at beijing xinglong observatory ( bao ) in china , the 0.76  m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; filippenko et al .",
    "2001 ) at lick observatory in the u.s . , and",
    "the 1.3  m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile .",
    "the tnt observations were obtained using a @xmath30 pixel back - illuminated charge - coupled device ( ccd ) with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 pixel@xmath12 ) , the kait observations were performed using an apogee ap7 camera with a fov of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 pixel@xmath12 ) , and the ctio 1.3  m observations were obtained using the dual - channel optical / near - infrared ( ir ) camera andicam having an optical fov of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 pixel@xmath12 ) and an ir fov of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 pixel@xmath12 ) .",
    "broad - band @xmath39 images were taken with all three telescopes , while the tnt also followed sn 2006x in the @xmath4 band and the ctio 1.3  m telescope sampled the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands .    as shown in figure 1 ,",
    "sn 2006x is located between a relatively bright foreground star and the inner edge of one spiral arm of ngc 4321 ; thus , light contamination needs to be taken into account when measuring the sn flux .",
    "one way to do this is to apply galaxy subtraction .",
    "template images of ngc 4321 in various bands were taken with kait and tnt on 2007 march 14 and 16 ( respectively ) , roughly one year after the discovery of sn 2006x .",
    "for the ctio 1.3  m observations , we used pre - explosion @xmath8 and @xmath5 images of ngc 4321 obtained on 24 april 2000 with the apache point observatory 3.5  m telescope in new mexico .    to perform image subtraction , the image containing sn 2006x is first geometrically registered to the corresponding template image .",
    "next , the total fluxes of corresponding foreground stars in the sn and template images are compared , and an appropriate scale factor is applied to the sn image in order to match the template image . also , the point - spread functions ( psfs ) of the two images are convolved to match .",
    "the template is then subtracted from the sn image , leaving the sn with a background that is free from host - galaxy contamination .",
    "the final step is to perform standard psf - fitting ( or aperture ) photometry to measure the instrumental magnitudes for the sn and the local standard stars with the iraf daophot package ( stetson 1987 ) . from the late - time @xmath42 ( hst )",
    "advanced camera for survey ( acs ) archival images ( proposal 10991 by arlin crotts 2006 ) , we speculate that sn 2006x was @xmath1322.0 mag in @xmath8 and @xmath1321.5 mag in @xmath5 about one year after maximum .",
    "this lingering light barely affects the early - time photometry but it probably results in underestimating the luminosity of sn 2006x by 3 - 6% when the sn becomes as faint as 18 @xmath14 19 mag .    the transformation from the instrumental magnitudes to the standard johnson @xmath43 ( 1966 ) and kron - cousins @xmath44 ( 1981 ) systems is established by observing , during a photometric night , a series of landolt ( 1992 ) standards covering a large range of airmasses and colors .",
    "the color terms obtained on different photometric nights show some differences , and their average values are listed in table 1 for the filters used in the tnt , kait , and ctio 1.3  m observations of sn 2006x .",
    "a total of 10 photometric nights ( 2 for tnt , 3 for kait , and 5 for the ctio 1.3  m ) were used to calibrate 10 local standard stars in the field of sn 2006x .",
    "table 2 lists the final calibrated @xmath0 magnitudes and their uncertainties , while table 3 presents the near - ir @xmath40-band and @xmath41-band magnitudes .",
    "only one photometric night was used to do the @xmath4-band calibration , so the calibrated magnitudes may have larger errors .",
    "the near - ir magnitudes of star 10 were measured on 14 nights with respect to the persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) standards p9144 and lhs2397a .",
    "the measured @xmath40 and @xmath41 magnitudes are 0.07 mag brighter than the values from the 2mass survey , which obtained @xmath40 = 14.793(0.025 ) mag and @xmath41 = 13.995(0.040 ) mag .",
    "these local standard stars are then used to transform the instrumental magnitudes of sn 2006x to the standard @xmath18 system , and the final results of the photometry are listed in table 3 and table 4 . note that the @xmath45-band data shown for ctio 1.3  m telescope include the s - corrections ( see details in  3.1 ) which are listed in table 5 .",
    "the estimated error shown in parentheses is a quadrature sum of uncertainties in the photometry and the calibrations .",
    "the main source of error comes from the photometry , caused by photon noise and uncertainties in the image subtraction .",
    "spectra of sn 2006x were primarily obtained with the 2.16 m telescope at bao using the cassegrain spectrograph and bao faint object spectrograph and camera ( bfosc ) , and with the 3.0 m shane telescope at lick observatory using the kast double spectrograph ( miller & stone 1993 ) .",
    "two very late - time spectra were also obtained at the w. m. keck observatory : one with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) mounted on the 10  m keck i telescope , and the other with the deep extragalactic imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ) mounted on the 10  m keck ii telescope .",
    "a journal of spectroscopic observations is given in table 6 .",
    "all spectra were reduced using standard iraf routines ( e.g.,foley et  al .",
    "extraction of the sn spectra was carefully performed to avoid contamination from the nearby star and the spiral arms of the galaxy . for the kast observations , flatfields for the red - side spectra",
    "were taken at the position of the object to reduce near - ir fringing effects .",
    "flux calibration of the spectra was performed by means of spectrophotometric standard stars observed at similar airmass on the same night as the sn .",
    "the spectra were corrected for continuum atmospheric extinction using mean extinction curves for bao and lick observatory ; also telluric lines were removed from the lick ( but not bao ) data .",
    "for spectra observed at lick and keck , the slit was always aligned along the parallactic angle to avoid chromatic effects in the data ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "this procedure was not adopted at bao , however , and it may not significantly affect the continuum shape as the airmass was usually low ( @xmath131.1 ) when getting these spectra for sn 2006x .",
    "in general , the relative spectrophotometry is quite good , consistent with the broadband photometry within about 5% .",
    "the @xmath18 light curves of sn 2006x are presented in figure 2 .",
    "no k - corrections have been applied to any of the magnitudes due to the small redshift of sn 2006x ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "for all the bands we have excellent temporal coverage , especially around maximum light .",
    "in general the optical measurements obtained with tnt , kait , and the ctio 1.3  m telescope are consistent with each other within @xmath470.05 mag , except in the @xmath7 band where differences are more noticeable .",
    "we find that the tnt @xmath7-band magnitudes are systematically brighter than those of kait by @xmath48 mag and also brighter than those of the ctio 1.3  m telescope , especially around the dip immediately after maximum where the discrepancy reaches @xmath130.2 mag .",
    "this larger difference is likely caused by the different instrument response function in the @xmath7 band for the different systems .    besides the usual color - term corrections , additional magnitude corrections between instrumental and standard bandpasses ( s - corrections ; stritzinger et al .",
    "2002 ) are sometimes required for the filters that are different from those defined by bessell ( 1990 ) .",
    "the filters amounted on tnt are standard johnson - cousins @xmath0 system , however , the filter transmission curves are unavailable .",
    "we obtained the s - corrections for observations of the ctio 1.3  m telescope ( see table 5 ) , except in @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands where the corrections were found to actually increase the systematic differences of the photometry obtained with different telescopes ( e.g. , kriscusnias et al .",
    "we thus have chosen to let the andicam @xmath6 and @xmath7 photometry stay as they are .",
    "the s - corrections for the filters closer to bessell s recipe are generally small in @xmath49 ( e.g. , @xmath50 0.05 mag ) but probably significantly larger in @xmath4 and @xmath7 ( e.g. , pastorello et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this is demonstrated by the consistency of the raw magnitudes of tnt and kait with the s - corrected magnitudes of the ctio 1.3  m in @xmath8 and @xmath5 bands within their errors ( see fig.2 ) . to account for the @xmath7-band magnitude difference between the tnt , kait , and the ctio 1  m telescope , we assign a systematic error of 0.10 mag for all the @xmath7-band magnitudes in the following analysis .",
    "a polynomial fit to the @xmath51band light curve around maximum yields @xmath52 mag on jd 2,453,786.17 @xmath47 0.35 ( 2006 february 19.93 ) .",
    "this means that our observations started from @xmath1411.27  d and extended to + 116.32  d with respect to the time of @xmath8 maximum .",
    "likewise , the @xmath5 light curve reached a peak magnitude of @xmath53 on jd 2,453,789.11 @xmath47 0.29 , about 2.9  d after @xmath8 maximum .",
    "the fitting parameters for the maxima in the other bands are presented in table 7 , together with the late time decline rates ( see below ) . from the @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath5 light curves we derived an observed @xmath54 mag for sn 2006x is @xmath55 , taking into account the reddening effect on the light - curve shape ( phillips et al .",
    "1999 ) . ] and @xmath56 mag .",
    "we also measured the @xmath57 color at 12  d after @xmath8 maximum to be @xmath58 mag .",
    "these colors are much redder than the intrinsic values shown by other sne  ia with similar @xmath59 ( see more discussion in  3.3 ) , suggesting that sn 2006x suffered significant line - of - sight reddening .    in figures",
    "3@xmath148 we compare the @xmath18 light curves of sn 2006x with those of other well - observed , nearby sne  ia having similar @xmath60 values , including sne 1994d ( @xmath61 ; richmond et al .",
    "1995 ; patat et al .",
    "1996 ) , 1998bu ( @xmath60 = 1.04 ; jha et al .",
    "1999 ) , 2002bo ( @xmath60 = 1.15 ; benetti et al . 2004 ; krisciunas et al . 2004 ) , 2002er ( @xmath60 = 1.32 ; pignata et al .",
    "2004 ) , 2003cg ( @xmath60 = 1.25 ; er06 ) , and 2005cf ( @xmath60 = 1.12 ; pastorello et al .",
    "the light curves of sn 1984a ( @xmath60 = 1.20 ; barbon et al .",
    "1989 ) , though not as well observed as those of the other sne in the comparison , are also included because sn 1984a shares many similar properties with sn 2006x , especially in the spectroscopy and late - time photometry .",
    "all the light curves have been normalized to the epoch of their @xmath8-band maximum and shifted in peak magnitude to match those of sn 2006x .",
    "figure 3 shows that the observed @xmath4-band light curve of sn 2006x is slightly broader than those of the other sne  ia around maximum light , but is comparable to that of sn 2003cg which also suffered significant reddening .",
    "two effects , both associated with large amounts of reddening , might explain why sne 2003cg and 2006x are broader than other sne in comparison . as demonstrated by phillips et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and jha et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the total - to - selective absorption ratio , @xmath62 , may vary with the supernova phase .",
    "for instance the true value of @xmath63 at 15  d past maximum is found to be smaller than that near maximum by about 0.15 ( jha et al .",
    "this would subsequently broaden the light curves of the reddened sne by @xmath64 . on the other hand , the change of the overall spectral shape due to the high reddening may shift the effective bandpass at the shorter wavelengths to the longer wavelengths that are characteristic of broader light - curve peaks ( see er06 for a similar argument for sn 2003cg ) .",
    "this may also contribute to the broader peak in @xmath4 .",
    "another possible feature of sn 2006x in the @xmath4 band is the late - time light curve , which despite the large error bar for each measurement , seems to be brighter and possibly declines more slowly than the other sne .",
    "figure 4 shows the comparison in the @xmath8 band .",
    "while the light curves near maximum are similar to each other , they diverge at late times .",
    "compared to other sne  ia , sne 2006x , 1984a , and 2002bo have relatively higher ( by 0.3@xmath140.5 mag ) luminosity after @xmath65  d , and their light curves decline more slowly .",
    "we measured a late - time decline rate of @xmath66 mag ( 100  d)@xmath12 for sn 2006x at @xmath67  d , which is comparable to the radioactive decay rate of 0.98 mag ( 100  d)@xmath12 for the co@xmath68fe decay .",
    "the decline rates for sne 1984a and 2002bo are slightly higher , @xmath69 mag ( 100  d)@xmath12 and @xmath70 mag ( 100  d)@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "all these decline rates are significantly smaller than the typical value of a normal sn  ia , @xmath71 mag ( 100  d)@xmath12 , as exhibited by the other sne  ia in the comparison .",
    "the @xmath5-band light curve comparison is shown in figure 5 . at around maximum ,",
    "sn 2006x is slightly broader , and shows a more prominent `` shoulder '' feature at @xmath72 weeks than other sne  ia .",
    "part of the reason for this may be that compared to other sne  ia , sn 2006x has higher reddening , and the effective @xmath5 bandpass is shifted more toward the @xmath6 band , which is broader than @xmath5 and has a prominent shoulder feature .",
    "it is also possible that there is an intrinsic scatter in the strength of the shoulder feature in the @xmath5-band light curves of sne  ia . in the same manner as the definition of @xmath59",
    ", we computed @xmath73 mag for sn 2006x .",
    "this is similar to that of sne 2003cg , 1998aq , and 2005cf [ @xmath74 mag , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 mag , respectively ] , but smaller than that of sne 1994d and 2002er [ @xmath77 mag and @xmath78 mag , respectively ] . at late times , sn 2006x has a similar evolution as sn 2002bo , and both are brighter than other comparison sne  ia .",
    "there are no obvious differences in the late - time decline rates among the sne .",
    "as shown in figures 6 and 7 , sn 2006x exhibits a more prominent `` plateau '' feature in the @xmath6 band and a stronger secondary maximum in the @xmath7 band than other sne  ia .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 light curves of sne  ia are similar to each other before @xmath79  d , but diverge after that .",
    "there are considerable differences in @xmath80 , the duration of the plateau phase in the @xmath6 band measures the interval of the two inflection times , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , of the post - maximum @xmath6-band light curves . the inflection time is defined as the moment when the first derivative at the transition phase s = @xmath83 is minimal ( e.g. , elmhamdi et al .",
    "2003 ) . ] and the time when the @xmath7 band reaches the second maximum [ @xmath84 : sn 2006x has @xmath85  d , and @xmath86  d , while sn 1994d has @xmath87  d and @xmath88  d. at late times , sn 2006x has an evolution similar to that of sn 2002bo in the @xmath6 band , and they are brighter than other sne  ia .",
    "the two sne , however , have different decline rates in the @xmath7 band , and sn 2006x is the brightest object in the comparison .    in figure 8 ,",
    "the @xmath40-band and @xmath41-band light curves of sn 2006x are compared with those of sne 1998bu , 2002bo , 2003cg , and 2005cf .",
    "the light curves of the well - observed sn 2001el ( @xmath89 mag ; krisciunas et al .",
    "2003 ) are also overplotted ( see the dotted curves ) . as in the optical bands ,",
    "the overall light curves of sn 2006x in @xmath40 and @xmath41 resemble closely those of sn 2002bo .",
    "after the initial peak , both of these sne show a stronger secondary maximum feature in the @xmath1 bands than other sne  ia in the comparison . in sn 2001el ,",
    "the @xmath40 second - peak feature is somewhat less pronounced ; the light curve remains relatively flat from day + 11 to + 31 .",
    "note that there is marginal evidence for a third maximum ( or shoulder ) in the near - ir light curves of sn 2006x at @xmath1370  d after @xmath8 maximum .",
    "kasen ( 2006 ) has come up with an explanation for the secondary maximum and has predicted that some sne  ia might show a third maximum at @xmath1380  d. the variation of the secondary maximum of the near - ir light curves can be related to the abundance stratification in sne  ia , the concentration of iron - group elements , and the progenitor metallicity ( kasen 2006 ) .",
    "the optical color curves of sn 2006x ( @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ) are presented in figure 9 .",
    "the colors of sn 2006x are much redder than those of the normal ia sn 2005cf ( the triangles ) with negligible reddening , suggesting a significant amount of reddening toward sn 2006x .",
    "also overplotted in these panels are the color curves of sne 1994d , 1998bu , 2002bo , 2002er , 2003cg , all arbitrarily shifted to match the observed colors of sn 2006x at @xmath8 maximum .    the @xmath92 color ( fig .",
    "9a ) of sn 2006x does not become progressively redder in a linear fashion after @xmath8 maximum as the other sne  ia do , but has a shoulder or plateau phase for about two weeks .",
    "a similar feature is observed in the heavily extinguished sn 2003cg .",
    "it is unclear whether this feature is caused by the high reddening of these two objects .",
    "after @xmath93 weeks , the @xmath94 colors of sn 2006x seem to be bluer than those of the comparison sne  ia , but the error bars of the measurements are relatively large due to the poor @xmath4-band data quality at late times .",
    "the @xmath57 colors of all sne in the plot ( fig .",
    "9b ) have a similar evolution before @xmath95  d , although sn 2006x reached the bluest color a bit earlier , e.g. at @xmath968.0 days rather than @xmath965 days for the other comparison sne .",
    "all the sne  ia reach the reddest color at @xmath95  d , although there are some differences in the time to reach the reddest color .",
    "the peak @xmath57 colors of the sne  ia with smaller decline rates ( or @xmath60 ) might occur later than those of the faster decliners ( see also figure 1 in wang et al .",
    "we note that the @xmath57 color of sn 2003cg is redder than that of other sne  ia by about 0.2 mag at the reddest peak according to the data from er06 . however , the photometric data based on the unpublished kait data of sn 2003cg do not have such a discrepancy . compared with other sne  ia ,",
    "the most notable difference in the @xmath57 color evolution of sn 2006x is after @xmath95  d : sn 2006x became bluer in a much faster pace , and showed an apparent difference from the lira - phillips relation ( the dash - dotted line in the figure ; see lira 1995 and phillips et al .",
    "note also that the @xmath57 color of sn 1994d , although not well observed during this phase , suggests a faster evolution than the lira - phillips relation .",
    "thus , as discussed in the more extreme case of the peculiar sn ia 2000cx ( li et al .",
    "2001 ) , although the lira - phillips relation provides a method to estimate the extinction toward sne  ia and may work in a statistical dataset , it should be used with caution for any individual sn  ia .    given the relatively large differences seen in the @xmath92 and @xmath97 color evolution between sn 2006x and other sne  ia in the comparison ,",
    "it is surprising that all sne  ia have similar @xmath98 color evolution except at very early times ( fig .",
    "the @xmath98 color of different sne  ia reaches the bluest point at @xmath1312  d after @xmath8 maximum , then become progressively redder and reaches the maximum around day + 31 .",
    "after the peak the @xmath98 color curve moves gradually toward bluer colors .",
    "the similar evolution in the @xmath98 color is related to the closer match of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 photometry and also a smaller reddening effect .",

    "the resulting quasi - bolometric light curve of sn 2006x is shown in figure 20 , together with those of the comparison sne  ia .",
    "the reddening - corrected quasi - bolometric luminosity of sn 2006x is ( @xmath188 erg s@xmath12 at maximum brightness , comparable to that of most comparison sne  ia but slightly fainter than sn 1998bu .",
    "differences in the peak luminosity are often considered to be caused by variations in the amount of @xmath189ni synthesized during the explosion .",
    "the `` bump '' feature at @xmath19032  d is more prominent in sn 2006x than in other comparison sne .",
    "this is caused by the more pronounced shoulder and `` second maximum '' seen in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and near - ir bands in sn 2006x .",
    "we also note that the contrast between the peak and tail luminosities of sn 2006x is the smallest among the sne in the comparison : it has a peak luminosity in the middle of the group , but the highest tail luminosity .",
    "efficiency of the trapping of the gamma rays and the positrons from @xmath189co decay ( milne et al . 2001 ) , and small - scale light echoes or ejecta - csm interaction , may account for this difference .    the radioactive @xmath189ni synthesized during a sn  ia explosion is the primary physical parameter determining the peak luminosity , the light curve width , and the spectrosocpic / color evolution of the event ( e.g. , kasen et al .",
    "one method to estimate the synthesized @xmath189ni mass is by assuming that the luminosity at maximum equals the instantaneous energy deposition rate from the radioactive decay , the so - called `` arnett law '' ( arnett 1982 ; arnett et al .",
    "1985 ; branch 1992 ) .",
    "following stritzinger & leibundgut ( 2005 ) , the maximum luminosity produced by the radioactive @xmath189ni can be written as @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the rise time of the light curve ( e.g. , the time spent by the sn from the explosion to the @xmath8-band maximum ) , and @xmath193 is the @xmath189ni mass ( in unit of the solar mass @xmath194 ) .",
    "assuming that the luminosity of a sn ia evolves as an expanding fireball at very early phase ( goldhaber 1998 ) , the rise time @xmath192 can be derived from the relation ( riess et al .",
    "1999 ) : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the elapsed time since maximum and @xmath197 is the parameter describing the rising rate of the luminosity .",
    "using very early photometric data in the @xmath6 band ( including the earliest unfiltered data from iau circ .",

    "this is within the reasonable range of @xmath189ni masses of normal sne  ia .",
    "the quoted error bar includes uncertainties in the rise time and bolometric luminosity .",
    "table 11 lists all the important parameters derived for sn 2006x in the previous sections as well as the parameters relevant to its host galaxy m100 .",
    "in this paper we present extensive optical and near - ir photometry , as well as optical spectroscopy , of the nearby sn ia 2006x in ngc 4321 ( m100 ) .",
    "our observations indicate that sn 2006x is a highly reddened object with an @xmath201 value much smaller than the canonical 3.1 for average galactic dust , and has the highest expansion velocity ever published for a sn  ia .    compared with other sne  ia included in this paper , sn",
    "2006x has a broader light curve in the @xmath4 band , a more prominent `` bump '' feature in the @xmath5 band , a more pronounced shoulder in the @xmath6 band , and a brighter second maximum in the @xmath202 bands .",
    "relative to the peak brightness , sn 2006x has a higher luminosity in the @xmath18 light curves during the nebular phase than other comparison sne  ia .",
    "the @xmath8-band decline rate at late times , @xmath66 mag ( 100  d)@xmath12 , is much smaller than that of most normal sne  ia .",
    "we note that other sne  ia with high expansion velocities , such as sne 1984a and 2002bo , also exhibit relatively small late - time decline rates .",
    "thus , slow late - time decline in the blue bands may be common for rapidly expanding sne  ia .",
    "the most notable features in the color curves of sn 2006x are a plateau in the @xmath92 color after @xmath8 maximum , and an obvious deviation from the lira - phillips relation at @xmath203 to 90  d. after sn 2006x reached its reddest color in @xmath57 at @xmath166  d , it became progressively bluer at a much faster pace than expected from the lira - phillips relation .",
    "we thus suggest that the lira - phillips relation should be applied with caution to any individual sn  ia .",
    "we use a global color curve fitting method and the empirical relations between @xmath60 , the peak colors @xmath122 , and the post - maximum color @xmath130 to determine the reddening and extinction of sn 2006x .",
    "this yields an average estimate of the host - galaxy reddening for sn 2006x , @xmath204 mag . assuming the absorption by dust follows the analytical model proposed by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , we obtain @xmath205 .",
    "the low @xmath16 value suggests that the dust around sn 2006x is quite different from that observed in the milky way galaxy , perhaps of a different origin than normal ism dust .",
    "this is also demonstrated by the relatively smaller ew of the interstellar na  i  d absorption in the spectra .",
    "further evidence against conventional interstellar dust for sn 2006x is that the polarized spectrum of sn 2006x is significantly different from that of extinguished galactic stars ( wang l et al .",
    "it is worth pointing out that most highly reddened known sne  ia , with @xmath206 mag , tend to have @xmath16 values smaller than 3.1 .",
    "this suggests that the dust affecting some sne  ia may be quite different from that observed in the galaxy .",
    "we caution , however , that sn 2006x may have a peculiar ( unknown ) intrinsic color evolution , as suggested by the deviation from the lira - phillips relation in the @xmath57 color .",
    "if so , it would be difficult to estimate the host - galaxy reddening toward sn 2006x and to study its photometric properties .",
    "spectra of sn 2006x reveal high expansion velocities , based on the imes and the iron - group elements .",
    "sn 2006x evolves in a manner similar to that of other rapidly expanding events such as sne 1984a and 2002bo . at early times , these high-@xmath161 objects have much stronger si  ii @xmath1506355 , ca  ii h&k , and ca  ii near - ir triplet lines than other sne  ia . at late times , spectra of sn 2006x show a relatively bluer overall continuum , especially at @xmath207   , than the comparison sne .",
    "this is consistent with the bluer @xmath92 and @xmath57 colors of sn 2006x than the other sne  ia at similar epochs , and suggests an additional input of energy , probably a light echo .    to explain the high - velocity features of some sne  ia , benetti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) proposed a scenario in which the burning to imes extends farther out into the outermost layers than in normal sne  ia .",
    "this model produces the imes at higher velocities , but with no additional @xmath189ni production , which provides a plausible explanation for most of the spectral features seen in sn 2006x .",
    "the above scenario should account not only for the high - velocity feature of the imes , but also for that of the iron - group elements at earlier phases of sn evolution .",
    "on the other hand , we propose that sn 2006x may be produced in a progenitor environment having abundant csm . in this scenario ,",
    "the high - velocity features shown in the spectra are formed due to the density increase caused by interaction between the supernova ejecta and the surrounding material of the progenitor system , which could be an accretion disk , a filled roche lobe , or a common envelope ( gerardy et  al .",
    "the csm dust , quite possibly associated with the csm produced by the progenitor system ( patat et al .",
    "2007 ) , may be the source of a local light echo that could account for the late - time extra energy ( beyond radioactive decay ) seen at short wavelengths .",
    "sn 2006x - like events may actually represent a subclass of sne ia with distinct features of spectroscopy , photometry , polarization and even extinction , and the presence of significant csm dust may be one of the possible explanations ( wang et al .",
    "2007 in preparations ) .",
    "there is also possibility that the detection of csm in sn 2006x is just tied to the particular viewing angle . obviously ,",
