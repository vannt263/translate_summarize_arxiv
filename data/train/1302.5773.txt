    "it is a well known fact that pest is a harmful insect and its outbreak often cause serious ecological and economic problems @xcite .",
    "evidence indicates that annually the pests cause 25% loss in rice , 5 - 10% in wheat , 30% in pulses , 35% in oilseeds , 20% in sugarcane and 50% in cotton @xcite .",
    "now a days , many pest control methods are available , such as biological , cultural , physical and chemical methods @xcite .",
    "however farmers mostly use pesticides to control pests because of its efficiency and convenience .",
    "the chemical pesticide kills not only pests but it also kills their natural enemies .",
    "actually , when pests are caught or poisoned to a large extent , their natural enemies become extinct due to no food and afterwards , when the pesticide intensity decreases , then the pests increase rapidly . due to this reason ,",
    "chemical control has become challenged .",
    "furthermore , the common practice proves that long - term adopting chemical control may give rise to disastrous results , for example , environmental contamination , toxicosis of the man and animals and so on .",
    "thus the pesticide pollution is also recognized as a major health hazard to human beings and to natural enemies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a well known that the biological control method is harmless to human , animal and environment .",
    "biological control is generally used to control a particular pest using a chosen living organism ; this chosen organism might be a predator , parasite or disease which attacks on the harmful insect pest .",
    "the last few years have seen an sudden increase of interest in the study of biological pests control using prey - predator interaction @xcite .",
    "moreover , effective use of biological control often requires a good understanding of the biology of the pest , its natural enemies and their interaction , as well as the ability to identify various life stages of relevant insects in the crops .",
    "again , the formulations of stage structured population models are the recognition that individuals of many species have life - histories composed of a sequence of stages within which their characteristics are broadly similar to those of other individuals in the same stage and totally different , from those of individuals in other stages . in insect population ,",
    "such stages are particularly easy to recognize , being separated by short events such as moult or pupation .",
    "many researchers studied stage - structured models before 1990 @xcite , but the real interest comes into picture on the stage structured models after the work of aiello and freedman @xcite .",
    "they proposed a single species model with stage structure assuming an average age to maturity ( i.e. , as a constant time delay ) which reflecting a delayed birth of immature and a reduced survival of immature to their maturity . the model is as follows : @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the immature and mature populations densities , respectively . here",
    ", it is assumed that at any time @xmath4 , growth rate of immature population is proportional to the existing mature population with proportionality constant @xmath5 ; the death rate of immature population is @xmath6 ; the death rate of mature population is proportional to the square of the population with the proportionality constant @xmath7 .",
    "the term @xmath8 represents the immature who were born at time @xmath9 and survive at time @xmath10 , therefore it represents the transformation of immature to mature , where @xmath11 represent a constant time to maturity .",
    "all the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are positive constants .",
    "further , the single species model ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is extended by many researchers into different kinds of stage - structured models and obtained significant results @xcite .",
    "recently , many authors studied different kinds of predator - prey system with division of the predators into immature and mature class and a good number of research has been carried out @xcite .",
    "one interested model is suggested by satio and takeuchi @xcite .",
    "they considered two life stages for predator and proposed the following predator - prey model : @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath2 is population density of prey , @xmath15 and @xmath3 denote the densities of immature and mature predator population , respectively ; @xmath11 represent a constant time to maturity for predator ; @xmath16 is the per capita rate of predation ; @xmath17 is the conversion rate and all other parameters have the similar meaning as in ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , three species food chain models are investigated by many researchers @xcite .",
    "one of noteworthy contribution is given by kuang et al .",
    "@xcite , they considered a three trophic food chain model for plant - pest - natural enemy , but they ignored the stage structure phenomena of species .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study a crop - pest - natural enemy model with two life stages of natural enemy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , model development is discussed , the positivity and boundedness are established in the section [ positivityboundedness ] . in section [ stability ]",
    ", all the feasible equilibria and their local stability behavior are studied .",
    "the stability and direction of hopf bifurcation is analyzed in section [ direction ] .",
    "further , in section [ numerical ] , a set of numerical simulations is given to verify all the major analytical findings .",
    "finally , conclusions for this paper are given in the last section .",
    "in this section , our main aim is to propose a mathematical model for the interaction of plant - pest - natural enemy .",
    "since plant - hoppers are serious pests for the rice crops and these are suppressed by lycosa tarantula and other spiders , it is well documented in a report of the indian council of agricultural research ( icar ) @xcite .",
    "the tarantula species has two major life stages , namely , immature and mature ; only mature population can harvest the pest and reproduce a new offspring . in modelling process , we assume that @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are densities of crop , pest , immature and mature natural enemy at time @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 are respectively the intrinsic growth rate and overcrowding rate of crops ; @xmath22 , @xmath23 are per capita predation rate of crop by the pest and the corresponding growth rate of pest , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 is per capita predation rate of pest by the natural enemy and @xmath25 is the corresponding growth rate of mature natural enemy . here , @xmath26 are the natural death rates of pests , immature and mature natural enemies , respectively .",
    "further , @xmath11 is the maturation delay from immature to mature natural enemies , the term @xmath27 represents the transformation of immature to mature population . keeping this biological situation in mind and motivated from the modelling ideas of @xcite , in this paper , we propose a three species stage structured crop - pest - natural enemy model as follows : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 the model completes with the following set of initial conditions : @xmath32 @xmath33,\\ \\",

    "we further require @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the accumulated survivors of those natural enemy members who were born between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the positivity and boundedness of solutions of the system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) with initial conditions ( [ eq2.3 ] ) and ( [ eq2.4 ] ) .",
    "positivity means that the species is persistent and boundedness implies a natural restriction .",
    "therefore , we can state and prove the following lemmas for the positivity and boundedness of solutions of the system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) :    [ positivity ] the solutions of system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) with initial conditions ( [ eq2.3 ] ) and ( [ eq2.4 ] ) are positive , for all @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 be a solution of system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) with initial conditions ( [ eq2.3 ] ) and ( [ eq2.4 ] ) .",
    "let us first consider @xmath19 for @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "noting that @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath46 $ ] , we obtain from the fourth equation of system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) that @xmath47 it thus follows for @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath49 for @xmath48 $ ] , the second equation of the system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath50 a standard comparison argument shows that for @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath51 similarly , it follows from the first equation of system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) that for @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath52 which evidences that @xmath53 in a similar way , we can treat the intervals @xmath54,\\ldots,[n\\tau,(n+1)\\tau],n\\in n$ ] .",
    "thus by induction , we establish that @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for all @xmath41 .",
    "finally from third equation of ( [ eq2.1 ] ) and ( [ eq2.4 ] ) , we have @xmath58 therefore the positivity of @xmath18 follows .",
    "[ boundedness ] the solutions of the system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) with initial conditions ( [ eq2.3 ] ) and ( [ eq2.4 ] ) are bounded .",
    "let @xmath59 , calculating the derivative of @xmath60 with respect to @xmath10 along the positive solution of the system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , we have @xmath61 taking @xmath62 , we obtain that @xmath63 hence there exists a positive constant @xmath64 such that @xmath65 thus , we get @xmath66 therefore , @xmath60 is bounded , i.e. , each solution of the system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) is bounded .",
    "in the next section , we will investigate the feasible equilibrium of the system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) and study their stability .",
    "in this section , our main objective is to investigate the local behavior of all feasible equilibria and existence of a hopf bifurcation at interior equilibrium . the equation for the variable @xmath67 in the system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath68 if @xmath3 , @xmath19 are bounded and @xmath69 , @xmath70 as @xmath71 , then @xmath72 as @xmath71 , i.e. , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath67 is completely dependent on @xmath3 and @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the asymptotic behavior of our proposed model will remain the same with the following reduced system : @xmath28 @xmath73 @xmath31 using simple algebraic manipulations , we get four feasible equilibria for the system ( [ eq3.1 ] ) , namely ,    1 .   trivial equilibrium @xmath74 ; 2 .   boundary equilibrium @xmath75 ; 3 .",

    "similarly , the characteristic equation for boundary equilibrium @xmath85 is as follows : @xmath86 clearly , all the eigenvalues are negative only when @xmath87 , which stabilize @xmath85 , otherwise it is unstable . again , the characteristic equation for planner equilibrium @xmath76 becomes @xmath88 since , both roots of the quadratic equation @xmath89 have negative real parts , hence the equilibrium @xmath90 is locally asymptotically stable if @xmath91 for all @xmath92 .    finally , the characteristic equation for interior equilibrium @xmath78 is given as : @xmath93 where @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 we write @xmath98 , @xmath99 in place of @xmath100 , @xmath101 for @xmath102 in the rest of the analysis .",

    "thus the interior equilibrium @xmath108 is locally asymptotically stable for @xmath105 if it exists .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the existence of purely imaginary roots @xmath109 of characteristic equation ( [ eqpq ] ) .",
    "we apply beretta and kuang @xcite geometric criterion which gives the existence of purely imaginary roots of a characteristic equation with delay dependent coefficients .",

    "in the previous section , we obtained the conditions , under which system ( [ eq3.1 ] ) undergoes hopf bifurcation , taking maturation delay ( @xmath11 ) as the critical parameter . using the normal form theory and center manifold reduction as described in hassard et al .",
    "@xcite , we can investigate the direction of hopf bifurcation and the properties of these bifurcating periodic solutions .",
