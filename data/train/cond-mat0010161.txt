    "the possible existence of small deviations from this law in the cosmic blackbody radiation has recently been discussed .",

    "nowadays , it is believed that this framework has been superseded by the so - called normalized one , advanced in @xcite , which seems to exhibit important advantages @xcite . this normalized treatment , in turn ,",
    "has been considerably improved by the so - called `` optimal lagrange multipliers '' ( olm ) approach @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to revisit the problem from such a new context .",
    "in such a vein we shall consider blackbody radiation in equilibrium within an enclosure of volume @xmath5 with the goal of ascertaining the possible @xmath3-dependence of the planck spectrum , steffan - boltzmann s law and wien s one .",
