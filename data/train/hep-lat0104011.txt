    "in standard methods for simulating lattice qcd , @xcite the dirac operator ( matrix ) becomes singular in the limit of zero quark mass .",
    "since these methods require inversion of the dirac operator they therefore fail for zero quark mass .",
    "the iterative methods for performing these inversions become progressively less efficient , requiring a number of iterations which diverges as this zero mass limit is approached .",
    "this means that , even at the mass of the physical @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks , simulations on modest size lattices become prohibitively expensive in computer time , and most simulations are performed with unphysically large light - quark masses .",
    "qcd with 2 light quark flavours is expected to undergo a second order chiral transition at finite temperature , only in the zero mass limit .",
    "it would thus be very helpful to be able to simulate in this limit in order to extract detailed information about this transition such as critical exponents and the equation of state in the neighbourhood of this transition . here",
    "we note a second difficulty with the standard action .",
    "in the zero mass limit on a finite lattice , the chiral condensate which we need to use as an order parameter vanishes on a configuration by configuration basis , which restricts how small a mass we can use on a given lattice size .",
    "this contrasts with the behaviour of most lattice spin models , where the magnetization ( the order parameter for this class of models ) has a finite value close to the infinite volume limit ( for large enough lattices ) , even for zero magnetic field , for each configuration .",
    "the way in which the magnetization averages to zero over the ensemble of configurations , which it must for zero applied magnetic field , is that the direction of magnetization changes from configuration to configuration to enforce this . on a large enough lattice , a reasonable approximation to the spontaneous magnetization",
    "is obtained by averaging the magnitude of the magnetization ( or its square ) over the ensemble .    to enable simulations at zero quark mass ,",
    "we have modified the standard staggered quark action by the addition of an irrelevant 4-fermion term which preserves the symmetries of the lattice action @xcite .",
    "such a term will not affect the continuum limit of the theory .",
    "it does , however , serve to render the dirac operator non - singular at zero quark mass . in the hadronic phase , where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , this is easy to understand .",
    "the chiral condensate provides an effective mass to the quarks through the 4-fermion coupling . even where the 4-fermion coupling is small , as it must be close to the continuum limit ,",
    "this `` constituent '' quark mass is large enough to keep the number of iterations required to invert the dirac operator manageable . with the standard",
    "staggered fermion action , the finite time extent of the lattice keeps the dirac operator from becoming singular in the plasma phase .",
    "it does , however , become nearly singular for topologically non - trivial gauge configurations due to the lattice remnant of the atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite . for our modified action",
    ", the conservation of the axial quark - number current is explicitly broken by the 4-fermion interaction , thus avoiding this consequence of the index theorem .",
    "this keeps the number of iterations required to invert the dirac operator manageable in the plasma phase .",
    "although early attempts to extract critical exponents from staggered - quark lattice qcd appeared promising @xcite , later attempts showed significant deviations from the @xmath8 or @xmath9 exponents expected from universality arguments .",
    "@xcite attempts to fit scaling with @xmath10 and quark mass @xmath11 to the scaling functions of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 3-dimensional spin models @xcite failed for lattices of temporal extent @xmath12 @xcite . while the situation appeared better for @xmath13 ( @xmath14 was somewhat ambiguous ) insufficient `` data '' existed to make this conclusive .    our earlier simulations with our new action on @xmath12 lattices at @xmath15 indicated that the transition was probably first order @xcite .",
    "ongoing simulations on an @xmath12 lattice with a smaller 4-fermion coupling indicate that the chiral transition is either a first order or a very narrow second order transition .",
    "the results of our simulations on @xmath16 and @xmath17 lattices summarized in an earlier letter @xcite and presented in detail in this paper , indicate that the @xmath18 transition is second order , but with the critical exponents of the 3-dimensional tricritical point , rather that those of the @xmath8 or @xmath9 spin models .",

    "the `` dots '' represent derivatives with respect to molecular dynamics `` time '' as distinct from normal time .",
    "we note that @xmath32 .",
    "although the determinant of @xmath33 does not appear to be real , it becomes so in the continuum limit . without the gauge fields , this theory reverts to the one studied in @xcite , with @xmath34 flavours .",
    "the advantage of this choice of the chiral 4-fermion interaction is that it preserves the axial @xmath35 chiral symmetry of the normal staggered quark lattice qcd action generated by @xmath36 at @xmath15 .",
    "this means that , when chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , the pion associated with @xmath37 will be a true goldstone boson and will be massless at @xmath15 , even for finite lattice spacing . under this exact chiral symmetry",
    "the fields transform as @xmath38 \\label{eqn : chiral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which we find that @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath15 .",
    "hence , for massless quarks the above lagrangian has an exact @xmath35 axial flavour symmetry , the same remnant of continuum chiral flavour symmetry as the standard staggered lattice lagrangian .",
    "near a critical point , the order parameters of the theory in question scale as powers of the parameters in the theory .",
    "since chiral symmetry is restored at the finite temperature transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma , the appropriate order parameter is the chiral condensate , @xmath40 .",
    "the equation of state describing the scaling of this order parameter close to the critical point is of the form @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is called the scaling function .",

    "since @xmath40 is non - zero for @xmath45 , @xmath46 equation  [ eqn : eos ] requires @xmath47 so that @xmath48 at @xmath49 , @xmath50 clearly , since @xmath51 , similar scaling relations exist for @xmath52 . in addition , at @xmath45 , the @xmath5 screening mass vanishes as @xmath53 since the correlation length @xmath54 of the system diverges as latexmath:[$\\xi \\propto    susceptibilities which measure the fluctuations in the order parameter(s ) . for reasons which will be explained later , we consider the scaling of the @xmath5 susceptibility ( @xmath56 ) , rather than that for @xmath40 , with @xmath57 . near @xmath49 , @xmath56 diverges as @xmath58 = c |t|^{-\\gamma_{mag}}.\\ ] ] here the inner angle brackets represent averages over the lattice for a single configuration while the outer angle brackets represent averages over the ensemble of configurations .",
    "let us briefly give the arguments which indicate the expected universality class for this transition .",
    "first one notes that the matsubara frequencies for bosonic excitations are @xmath59 , while those for fermionic excitations are @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the expectation that only low lying excitations contribute to critical phenomena leads one to the expectation that , at high t , only the lowest bosonic excitation @xmath61 contributes and the fermions decouple .",
    "since this lowest bosonic mode is independent of time , this leads to an effective 3-dimensional theory ( dimensional reduction ) @xcite . since the masses of the @xmath62 chiral multiplet vanish at the chiral transition , these excitations alone should determine the critical scaling at this transition .",
    "the effective field theories describing the interactions of the @xmath62 multiplet are 3-dimensional @xmath8 sigma models .",
    "thus 2-flavour qcd should lie in the universality class of the @xmath8 sigma model in 3-dimensions @xcite , with critical exponents @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "of course , lattice qcd with staggered quarks has only one goldstone pion , and this symmetry is reduced to @xmath9 .",
    "thus if the lattice is coarse enough that this symmetry breaking is relevant , 2-flavour qcd should lie in the universality class of the @xmath9 sigma model in 3-dimensions , with critical exponents @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "of course , other possibilities exist .",
    "first the transition could be first order , which appears to be the case at @xmath12 with our first choice of 4-fermi coupling @xcite .",
    "once the lattice spacing is large enough that lattice artifacts can affect the transition , more symmetry breaking and symmetry conserving operators come into play giving a more complex transition .",
    "the simplest of these is the tricritical point .",
    "the sigma models which give the universal critical points discussed in the previous paragraph lie in the universality class of the polynomial sigma models which are quartic in the fields .",
    "tricritical behaviour occurs in sigma models which are sixth order in the fields @xcite .",
    "this means that there is a second symmetry preserving parameter or temperature and a second symmetry breaking parameter or magnetic field . since 3",
    "is the upper critical dimension for such sigma models , the critical exponents are given by a mean field analysis .",
    "thus @xmath71 , the @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the 2 values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath75 describe the scalings when the 2 ` magnetic fields ' are varied independently .",
    "even more values are possible when we take into account the second ` temperature ' .",
    "a tricritical point occurs where a line of first order phase transitions continues as a line of second order phase transitions or in general where there are 2 competing phase transitions .",
    "our @xmath12 simulations at @xmath76 which showed evidence for a first order transition were reported in an earlier paper @xcite . here",
    "we present the details of our simulations on @xmath16 and @xmath17 lattices .",
    "a brief summary of these results were given in a letter @xcite .",
    "our @xmath16 simulations were performed at @xmath76 and @xmath77 while our @xmath17 simulations were done at @xmath77 .",
    "we shall first discuss our results for zero mass quarks . here , without the benefit of the symmetry breaking interaction ( quark mass term ) , the direction of symmetry breaking changes over the run so that @xmath52 and @xmath78 and the corresponding chiral condensates @xmath40 and @xmath79 ( where the @xmath80 is averaging only over the lattice , not the ensemble ) average to zero over the ensemble .",
    "it is in this way that the absence of spontaneous breaking of this continuous symmetry on a finite lattice is enforced .",
    "note that this contrasts with the standard lattice formulation , where if we could simulate at zero quark mass , the chiral condensates would vanish on a configuration by configuration basis , and there would be no way to predict the infinite lattice results . in our case , we can estimate the infinite lattice results by averaging the magnitudes @xmath81 and @xmath82 , introducing an error which is of order @xmath83 below the phase transition and @xmath84 above it , on a lattice of 4-volume @xmath85 .",

    "smoothness criteria caused us to also exclude the @xmath186 point .",
    "even then no fit came close to the @xmath187 point . here",
    "we suspect that this is because @xmath159 was more poorly determined than in the @xmath76 case .",
    "deviations of @xmath19 from @xmath159 have the most effect on the lowest mass point as is clear from equation  [ eqn : eos ] . excluding these 3 points",

    "this curve is plotted in figure  [ fig : delta20 ] .",
    "clearly such a fit should be considered at best suggestive , so we base our conclusion that the scaling of @xmath40 with mass is in accord with tricritical scaling purely on the @xmath76 measurements .    from the plot of screening masses of figure  [",
    "fig : spmass ] , it is clear that nothing quantitative can be obtained from the @xmath5 masses in the low temperature domain .",
    "we have therefore concentrated our efforts on fitting the joint @xmath129 screening masses in the plasma region to the scaling form @xmath192 . since different treatment of these screening masses in the hadronic matter and quark - gluon plasma phases",
    "could bias our results , we chose to adopt the joint fit of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 propagators of equation  [ eqn : ps.mass ] over the whole range of @xmath19 .",
    "this fit will be correct in the plasma phase . in the low temperature phase",
    ", the non - zero vacuum expectation value of the @xmath5 field should drive the fitted ` mass ' to zero .",

    "we attribute this to the systematic errors in performing fits to point - source propagators with a lattice extent of only @xmath204 and limited statistics . from these fits",
    "we conclude that @xmath2 is consistent with the tricritical value ( @xmath205 ) , but does not rule out an @xmath8 or @xmath9 value .",
    "we have extracted a susceptibility from our @xmath5 ` data ' on the @xmath17 lattice at @xmath77 using @xmath206 $ ] . since our estimate of @xmath207",
    "was obtained after rotating @xmath52 to where @xmath102 configuration by configuration this actually defines a ` radial ' rather than the conventional susceptibility . however , this should diverge in the same manner as the conventional susceptibility , which is all that matters .",
    "fitting to the form @xmath208 over the range @xmath209 gives @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 with a @xmath213 confidence level .",
    "our measurements and fit are plotted in figure  [ fig : susc ] . since the value of this critical exponent lies between the 2 @xmath3 values ( @xmath205 and @xmath214 ) associated with the tricritical point , but far from the @xmath8 and @xmath9 exponents this is further evidence for tricriticality .",
    "the reason we did not use the @xmath40 susceptibility is that our measurements of @xmath40 are noisy estimators using a single noise vector per configuration which gives extra contributions to the susceptibility estimate that can only be removed by use of more than one noise vector per configuration .",
    "we have presented evidence that the @xmath18 finite temperature phase transition for 2-flavour staggered lattice qcd with extra chiral 4-fermion interactions is in the universality class of a 3-dimensional tricritical point rather than that of the 3-dimensional @xmath8 or @xmath9 sigma model , which was expected . since",
    "a tricritical point occurs when there are extra relevant operators with consequent competing transitions , we believe this to be due to the extra higher - dimensional operators which can be important on such coarse lattices . for this reason",
    ", we believe the @xmath8/@xmath9 universality class would be observed for sufficiently fine lattices , i.e. those with sufficiently large @xmath215 .",
    "since the @xmath12 transition with @xmath76 was observed to be first order , and a tricritical point marks the transition from first order to universal second order behaviour , this strongly suggests that @xmath8/@xmath9 universality would be observed for @xmath215 as small as @xmath216 .    the fact that our modified action allowed us to work at zero quark mass was crucial in allowing us to come to these conclusions .",
    "this enabled us to measure the critical exponent @xmath0 directly .",
    "our best estimates lay in the range @xmath217 ( with errors typically around 2 in the second decimal place ) which is consistent with the @xmath218 of the tricritical point , but inconsistent with the @xmath219 of the @xmath8 sigma model , the @xmath220 of the @xmath9 sigma model and the @xmath205 of mean field theory .",
    "because these scaling fits give precise estimates for @xmath159 , it is possible to measure @xmath1 directly from the scaling of the chiral condensate with quark mass with @xmath19 fixed at @xmath159 .",
    "this value , @xmath165 , lay between the two @xmath1 values ( 3 and 5 ) of the tricritical point , and a satisfactory fit to the more complex scaling this implies was obtained . again",
    "this behaviour was incompatible with @xmath8/@xmath9 scaling where @xmath221 and mean field scaling with @xmath222 .",
    "the scaling of the @xmath223 mass in the plasma domain yielded a @xmath2 value which was compatible with tricritical , @xmath8/@xmath9 and mean field scaling .",
    "finally we were able to extract the susceptibility critical exponent @xmath212 which lies between the two values ( @xmath205 and @xmath214 ) of the tricritical point but disagrees with the @xmath8/@xmath9 values ( @xmath224 and @xmath225 ) and the mean field value ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "since we believe we are seeing more complex phase structure which is driven by lattice artifacts , the behaviour we are seeing does not have to apply to the standard staggered action .",
    "however , since scaling analyses with the standard action on @xmath12 lattices showed definite departures from @xmath8/@xmath9 universality @xcite it strongly suggests that some such behaviour is present .",
    "in fact , based on our earlier , @xmath12 results one of the collaborations suggested @xcite that these anomalies might be associated with the first order transition we reported in @xcite . unfortunately there are not yet sufficient high precision measurements with the standard action at @xmath18 to tell if it too displays departures from @xmath8/@xmath9 universality .    clearly , simulations at @xmath226 should be next on our agenda .",
    "we would also suggest that the addition of such 4-fermion terms should be considered for other actions , especially improved staggered actions .",
