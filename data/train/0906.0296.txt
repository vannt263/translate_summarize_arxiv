    "figure  [ old_and_linelist ] demonstrates that possibly incomplete line lists have the largest effect on the rosseland mean opacities since it is dominated by transparent spectral regions due to the harmonic nature of the averaging process ( eq .  [ eq : ross ] ) .",
    "therefore , uncertainties in weak - line opacities do have a considerable influence in particular on the rosseland mean opacities for a tentative line opacity threshold of @xmath36@xmath30/g . at temperatures below 1000k uncertainties in the line",
    "opacities become noticiable already at a level of @xmath31@xmath30/g .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the large number of c / o and n / o values should allow models to use the opacity tables for a number of different purposes , like star and planet formation or disk simulations .",

    "[ chem1 ] and [ chem2 ] , which show large variations between the oxygen- and carbon - rich cases .",

    "lowering the metallicity shifts the point where the densities for each case cross ; the same occurs when increasing n / o .",
    "sio shows similar behaviour , but the rising density as temperature decreases flattens just before the high - c density overtakes high - o .",
    "both molecules , tio and sio , can therefore contribute to the absorption of a carbon - rich gas at temperatures below 1000k .",
    "comparing all the plots , similar features become apparent at certain temperatures . in the carbon - rich case , it can be seen that many molecules densities have a turning - point at @xmath65 .",
    "cn , @xmath66 and @xmath67 all reach a peak here before falling again , tio and sio reach a minimum , and @xmath68 and hcn fall off at the end of a plateau . the exact temperature at which these changes occur seems dependent on the metallicity : in all cases it appears as though decreasing the metallicity shifts the point at which these changes in the molecular abundances occur to lower temperatures .",
    "looking at the opacity tables for @xmath69 , a peak is noticed in both the planck and rosseland means at @xmath70 .",
    "this is caused by the molecules whose number densities also reach a maximum here .",
    "the peak occurring at very low temperatures ( @xmath64 ) in the rosseland mean could be a result of the changing densities of several molecules . at the lower temperature boundary , where the opacity peak can be seen to",

    ", @xmath68 and hcn are increasing to the point where they level out into a plateau .",
    "where they reach this point corresponds to the peak in the opacity table .",
    "while these two molecules stay at roughly the same density , the two oxides are removed , lowering the opacity .",
    "this holds with lederer & aringer ( 2008 ) who found that @xmath68 and hcn are the main contributors to their carbon - rich rosseland mean opacities at these low temperatures .",
    "the oxygen - rich molecule densities show a similar ` characteristic ' temperature . at @xmath70 , @xmath71 , which is before this point constant , falls off very quickly , while tio reaches a peak .",
    "sio also peaks , but at a point perhaps nearer to @xmath72 . as in the carbon - rich case , the metallicity shifts the position of the features .",
    "the initial plateau in the planck mean and the prominent peak in the rosseland mean can be easily seen to result from the initial high densities of @xmath71 , sio and @xmath73 , and other molecules which reach maxima here such as tio , oh and no .    in the planck and rosseland means for both c / o cases , a small rise can be noticed at @xmath74 .",
    "this seems to be due to an interesting rise in the density of molecules containing the least abundant of the two elements , eg .",
    "if @xmath47 then molecules containing oxygen reach a peak at about this temperature , and vice verse .",
    "it is important to note that this is the temperature beyond which co s density is seen to fall away , ie .",
    "it begins to dissociate .",
    "as this happens , atoms of both carbon and oxygen are released , allowing other molecules to form .",
    "however the rising temperature inevitably brings about continued dissociation of these molecules as well , leading to the downwards slope seen on all plots .",
    "some of the peaks at @xmath74 are of considerable height , allowing contribution the rise noted in the opacities .",
    "it is also important to note what effects changing the n / o ratio has on the molecular densities , and so on the opacities .",
    "it can be seen that for molecules not containing nitrogen , increasing n / o leads to a reduction in the gas density .",
    "this is because in order to maintain a defined metallicity , when the nitrogen abundance is increased , the other metals abundances must be decreased . for those molecules which do contain nitrogen ,",
    "this is different , and furthermore specific to the species in question .",
    "for example , the density of no ( figure [ chem2 ] ) increases with n / o in the carbon - rich case , while in the oxygen - rich case the opposite is true .",
    "figure [ chnitro ] shows the difference more clearly .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath75 decreases with n / o in the oxygen - rich case , yet when @xmath69 the relationship becomes very unclear with a seeming dependence on temperature as well as",
    "n / o . despite these more complex relationships",
    ", most molecules still decrease in number with increasing n / o , leading to the overall decrease in the mean opacities observed in figure [ tables ] .    comparing the plots of hcn and @xmath75 in figures [ chem1 ] and [ chem2 ] with their counterparts in figure [ chnitro ]",
    ", it may be seen that in the carbon - rich cases , and at @xmath76 when oxygen - rich , the molecules number densities are lower at n / o = 0.14 and 50.0 than they are when n / o = 1.0 or 5.0 .",
    "this suggests an optimal n / o ratio which is associated with a maximum in the number density of nitrogen - containing molecules , and dependent on competition between the abundances of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "also note that @xmath75 remains in very low numbers throughout the whole temperature range . while this molecule has little effect on the mean opacities in the temperature interval considered here ( @xmath77k ) , hcn in particular has a strong influence .",
    "finally , also included in the opacity calculations were lines by collision induced absorption ( cia ) by @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these are known to contribute significantly to lower temperature and high pressure opacities , however due to the nature of this kind of absorption it can not be probed as has been done for the molecular lines .",
    "borysow , jrgensen & zheng ( 1997 ) demonstrated that collision induced absorption is one of the most important opacity source in the atmospheres of the lowest metallicity stars ( their fig .",
    "we present a set of gas - phase planck mean and rosseland mean opacity tables applicable for simulations of star and planet formation , stellar evolution , disk modelling at various metallicities of a hydrogen - rich gas .",
    "the rosseland mean values are suitable in hot and dense regions of an absorbing gas , where the mean free path of all photons of arbitrary wavelength is smaller than the characteristic scale height of the gas , and hence , the radiative transfer diffusion approximation holds . here , the large number of weak absorption lines is well represented by the rosseland mean opacity values .",
    "if the gas becomes optically thin , the diffusion approximation becomes invalid , and single , strong absorbing frequencies may become important and determine the radiative flux . in the limiting case of a missing correlation between the frequency distribution of the flux and the frequency distribution of the opacity , e.g. due to line shifts induced by velocity fields , the planck mean opacity values can serves as a good approximation .",
    "tables are produced for c / o= 0.43@xmath80 , for n / o= 0.14@xmath80 , and [ m / h]@xmath81 ( [ m / h]=[m / h]@xmath82[m / h]@xmath83 , [ m / h]@xmath84 , see sect.[ss : oxygen ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the present uncertainty regarding the oxygen abundance values do affect the mean opacity results .",
    "we therefor provide tables for the values from grevesse , asplund & sauval  ( 2007 ) and for the value from caffau et al.(2008 ) .",
    "we demonstrate the dependence of our mean opacity values on c / o , n / o and metallicity . the oxygen - to - carbon - rich transition range around c / o@xmath45 is particular interesting , and our results demonstrate that weak line opacity sources are important here .",
    "we caution , however , that uncertainties in the weak - line opacity data can strongly influence the rosseland mean opacities at a tentative threshold of @xmath85@xmath30/g for @xmath86 in eq .",
