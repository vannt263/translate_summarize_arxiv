    "superconductivity in intermetallic compounds has become of great interest lately . among the most relevant of these compounds",
    "are the iron ( oxy)pnictides ( @xmath4 up to 55 k ) , the quaternary borocarbides ( @xmath4 up to 23 k ) and binary mgb@xmath5 ( @xmath6 k ) .",
    "other intermetallic superconductors of the types ret@xmath5x@xmath5 and re@xmath0t@xmath1x@xmath1 ( re = rare earth , t = transition metal , x = si , ge , sn ) have also received attention because of their magnetic and superconducting phases . in particular those crystallizing in orthorhombic u@xmath0ni@xmath1si@xmath1 type of structure ( @xmath7 ) ,",
    "of which the ce - based systems have ground states showing kondo effects and their nonmagnetic lanthanum counterparts have superconducting phases .",
    "an example of isostructural intermetallic compounds are ce@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 and la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 .",
    "the former shows quantum criticality due to kondo effect and does not display superconductivity , while the latter becomes superconductive below 2.15 k. here we are concerned with the superconducting state of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 , which has been suggested to be described by a two - band model in a recent work on specific heat and critical fields @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with recent electronic band - structure calculations that indicate multi - band fermi surfaces in this material @xcite .",
    "two - gap superconductivity would be surprising in this material , since standard @xmath8-wave bcs superconducting states have been found in all other la - t - x compounds .",
    "early dc magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements suggest that la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 is a type ii superconductor @xcite .",
    "in previous works it was suggested that impurity phases like lapd@xmath5si@xmath5 or la@xmath5pd@xmath0si@xmath0 may exist in polycrystalline samples of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 .",
    "although it was not possible to index some extra x - ray peaks to a lapd@xmath5si@xmath5 phase in ref .",
    "[ ] , the data clearly indicate the presence of an impurity phase . in another x - ray study @xcite ,",
    "small extra peaks were indexed to la@xmath5pd@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "the impurity in la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 is not well established , but it seems sure that its presence is only of the order of a few percent or less .    here , we intend to shed light on the energy gap structure of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 by measuring the magnetic penetration depth of polycrystalline samples down to 0.02@xmath4 .",
    "the magnetic penetration depth @xmath9 is a direct response of the cooper pairs and is widely considered one of the most powerful probes for the superconducting energy gap structure .",
    "we found that the penetration depth of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 may be explained by one - gap ( @xmath8-wave ) superconductivity in the presence of an impurity phase .",
    "the la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 sample ( @xmath10 k ) measured in this work was the same used in ref .",
    "penetration depth measurements were carried out utilizing a 13.5 mhz tunnel diode oscillator @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the ac probing field was estimated to be less than 5 moe , and the dc field at the sample was reduced to around 1 moe .",
    "the deviation of the penetration depth from the lowest measured temperature , @xmath11 , was obtained up to @xmath12 from the change in the measured resonance frequency @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",
    "here @xmath15 is a constant that depends on the sample and coil geometries and that includes the demagnetizing factor of the sample . to within this calibration factor ,",
    "@xmath16 are raw data .",
    "we estimated @xmath15 by measuring a sample of known behaviour and of the same dimensions as the test sample .",
    "the main panel of figure  [ figlambda](a ) shows the normalized deviation from its zero - temperature value of the penetration depth of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 and pure indium ( 6n ) polycrystalline samples below 0.8@xmath4 .",
    "the inset of figure  [ figlambda](a ) depicts the same data in the entire superconducting region .",
    "a small ( about 0.6@xmath17 of the total signal ) anomaly around 1 k is clearly observed in la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 sample . since the indium data were taken under identical conditions and behave exactly as expected , the anomalous behaviour must comes from the la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 sample .    in ref .",
    "[ ] it was suggested that la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 may be described in terms of two - gap superconductivity .",
    "however , a two - gap model does not follow the low - temperature penetration depth data of this compound , as can be seen in figure  [ figlambda](b ) .",
    "the experimental data are instead accounted for by a more general two - gap two - critical - temperature model , which in general suggest ( a ) a single phase with two independent superconducting energy bands or ( b ) two independent superconducting phases .",
    "the first scenario is an exotic situation never seen thus far , whereas the second one points out to the existence of a superconducting impurity in a sample .",
    "an example of the occurrence of the latter is mo@xmath0al@xmath5c @xcite .",
    "we believe scenario ( b ) is the most likely here in view of the proven existence of an impurity phase in la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 @xcite",
    ". the small size of the anomaly is consistent with the very large superconducting volume assigned to the la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 phase @xcite .",
    "recent x - ray studies have discussed the possible presence of la@xmath5pd@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite or lapd@xmath5si@xmath5 @xcite in la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 samples . to the best of our knowledge , in the la - pd - si system , apart from la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 , only three other phases are superconductive : lapdsi@xmath0 ( @xmath18 k ) @xcite , lapd@xmath5si@xmath5 ( @xmath19 k ) @xcite , and la@xmath0pd@xmath20si ( @xmath21 k ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a careful analysis of the experimental data of la@xmath0pd@xmath20si in ref .",
    "[ ] indicates that in this compound both the zero resistivity and the peak of the specific heat jump occur around 1 k. these latter parameters are more closely related to the onset of the superconducting transition in susceptibility measurements .",
    "hence , the anomaly around 1 k in the penetration depth of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 may have been caused by small segregations of la@xmath0pd@xmath20si .",
    "a re - analysis of the la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 x - ray spectrum did not confirm the presence of la@xmath0pd@xmath20si @xcite .",
    "however , the amount or volume fraction of the impurity in la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 is of the order of 1@xmath17 or less , as detected here and in ref .",
    "[ ] , and could be too small to allow a detection by x - ray diffraction .",
    "similarly , the resolution of the specific heat probe may not be enough to detect a tiny superconducting jump originated by a small amount of impurity , but be sufficient to observe a deviation from a pure s - wave behaviour .",
    "the present analysis suggests that la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 is an @xmath8-wave superconductor .",
    "an important result here is that the penetration depth of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 flattens out in the low - temperature region , below 0.2@xmath4 ( main panel of figure  [ figlambda](a ) ) .",
    "this unambiguously indicates , regardless of the origin of the second drop , a _ nodeless _ energy gap structure in la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it also implies that the superconducting impurity , say la@xmath0pd@xmath20si , has a nodeless energy gap too .",
    "next , we discuss our data in more detail by means of the superfluid density .",
    "we performed numerical calculations of the superfluid density for @xmath8-wave , two - gap , and two - phase models and compared them with the experimental data .",
    "for this purpose , we used the zero - temperature penetration depth @xmath22 nm , as determined in ref .",
    "[ ] and can be closely estimated from the london penetration depth @xmath23 nm and @xmath24 given in ref .",
    "[ ] . with a ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath25 @xcite , la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 is a local superconductor .",
    "for such a superconductor the normalised superfluid density @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the total density , is given by    @xmath28 \\,.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath29 is the contribution to the total superfluid density of @xmath30 band ( phase ) and is related to the density of states on the corresponding fermi surface .",
    "@xmath31 is the fermi function .",
    "the total energy @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the single - particle energy measured from the fermi surface .",
    "we use here the standard weak - coupling gap interpolation formula @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the zero - temperature energy gap and @xmath36 is a constant related to the specific heat jump at the superconducting transition .    for the local bcs model we used the standard bcs parameters . for the two - gap model",
    "we consider that the gaps are somehow coupled through interband interactions and the expression of @xmath37 given above differs for the two gaps only in the values of @xmath35 . for this model eq .",
    "( [ supdens ] ) reduces for two bands @xmath38 and @xmath8 to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the relative contribution of @xmath41 band to the total superfluid density .",
    "for the two - phase model a second gap opens when the superconducting transition of the impurity phase takes place and in the expression for the gap interpolation formula , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath4 are different for each phase .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the superfluid density data and the results of the numerical calculations . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig:2](a ) also depicts the excellent agreement of the well established indium data and the simulation of the nonlocal bcs model ( indium is a nonlocal superconductor ) , just to confirm the performance of the experimental system .",
    "consistent with the penetration depth data , the superfluid density of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 is temperature independent below 0.4 k. also , the anomaly around 1 k in the penetration depth is displayed as a smooth bend in the superfluid density .    in figure  [ fig:2](a )",
    "we compare the experimental data with the simulations of local bcs and two - gap models .",
    "the local bcs is in clear disagreement with the experimental data . for the best adjusting parameters",
    "the two - gap model does not follow the data quite well either , as opposed to what was suggested from the specific heat measurements @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for the two - phase model the agreement with the data is remarkable in the whole temperature region , as seen in figure  [ fig:2](b ) . in this case , @xmath42 is the normalized density of states of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 .",
    "the best values for @xmath43 and @xmath36 are given in table  [ table ] .",
    "although in la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 the value of @xmath43 is the one expected in the weak - coupling approximation , the parameter @xmath36 is much higher than expected in this approximation .",
    "the impurity phase would also be a conventional @xmath8-wave superconductor but in the strong - coupling limit , as indicated by the high values of @xmath43 and @xmath36 . in ref .",
    "[ ] la@xmath0pd@xmath20si was suggested to be a weak - coupling superconductor .",
    ".[table ] adjusting values of the model based on two superconducting phases . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     our results suggest that la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 is a conventional @xmath8-wave superconductors as all la - based intermetallic compounds , leaving exotic superconductivity to the ce - based materials .",
    "in summary , we performed magnetic penetration depth measurements in polycrystalline samples of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 . at the lowest temperatures of our measurements the superfluid density is temperature independent , indicating that the gap structure of la@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath1 is nodeless .",
    "we found a second diamagnetic drop in the penetration depth that displays a smooth kink in the superfluid density .",
    "we suggest that the second drop maybe due to a superconducting impurity ( possibly la@xmath0pd@xmath20si ) , and not necessarily a manifestation of two - band superconductivity .",
