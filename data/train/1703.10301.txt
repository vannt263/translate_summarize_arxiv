    "the transmittance and the model seds at different redshifts are shown in figure [ fig : trans_schematic ] .",
    "we also estimated the oversubtraction of the  flux in the r - band using the model sed at each redshift . because our continuum subtraction is not performed in magnitude but in the renormalized counts , the oversubtracted flux is proportional to the -r  pixel value regardless of the  equivalent width . in the redshift range ,",
    "the oversubtraction is 1830% .",

    "the value includes the photon noise of the background sky , the readout noise , and errors in the data reduction .",

    "the change of r - nb magnitude of continuum is about 0.15 mag peak - to - peak .",
    "it means that the error of -r count could be @xmath5 10% of the rescaled r - band count .",
    "in the regions where the rescaled r - band count is comparable to or larger than the -r counts , this error is the dominant one .",
    "we summed the rescaled r - band count where the count is larger than -r counts , and used 10% of the sum as the estimated error of the -r counts .",
    "the errors given in table [ tab : clouds ] include the errors described above ; the background variation , the zero - point uncertainty , and the possible continuum error , assuming that the three errors are independent .    in the conversion of the -r count to the  flux ,",
    "various uncertainties exist , since we do nt have spectroscopic information of eigs .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : trans_schematic ] , the redshift should change the observed count in -band .",
    "thus the error of the redshift can introduce an error in  flux . as mentioned in section [ sec : nb2 ha ] , the error is @xmath5 40% if no parent galaxy is identified .",
    "even if the redshift of the parent galaxy is known , the eig may have a recession velocity different by several hundred km s@xmath6 from the parent as in the coma eigs @xcite .",
    "if the offset is 300 km s@xmath6 , for example , it may introduce @xmath33 10% error . in the conversion from -r to the  flux , we adopted a model sed with several assumptions in emission line ratios ; / , / , and /.",
    "the uncertainty of /  directly affects the conversion , which may introduce @xmath5 40% error .",

    "the nearest agn from the orphan clouds is cgcg  097 - 121 at @xmath5 180 kpc in @xcite , which is classified as a liner .",
    "if the orphan clouds are also ionized by the agn , the ionizing flux from the agn would be weaker by an order or more than that at hanny s voorwerp because of the distance . added to that ,",

    "* ) , it is natural that that the evolution is slower in 1367 . from the x - ray observation by asca @xcite ,",
    "the central gas density of 1367 is about 1/5 of that of the coma , the mass is about 1/14 , and the core radius is 30% larger .",
    "thus the ram pressure , which is proportional to the density and the square of the velocity , should be weaker in 1367 . the smaller number of parents with post - starburst signature in 1367 is also explained by the lower efficiency of the ram - pressure stripping .    the longer length of eigs in 1367 requires another explanation .",
    "the length of eigs shows the distribution of the ejected gas from the parents and/or the reach of the ionization photons .",
    "if the ionization mechanism is something that is spatially restricted , such as an uv from the young stars of the parent galaxy or inside of eig , or agn , the eig length would be determined by the range of the flux .",
    "if it is the case , however , a gradient of sb according to the distance from the uv source is expected , which is not observed in the eigs in 1367 and in the coma .",
    "therefore the length would mainly represent the distribution of the ionized gas . according to goldmine @xcite ,",
    "the parent galaxies of a long eig in 1367 have a stellar mass comparable to those in the coma .",
    "thus the original gas before stripping would have been comparable , too .",
    "we present two possible explanations on the longer distribution of the ionized gas in 1367 .",
    "one is that the removal of the gas is relatively slower and longer lasting in 1367 , because of the low efficiency of the ram - pressure stripping .",
    "another possibility is that the short length of eigs in the coma does not mean the short duration of the gas removal , but the distant part of the gas was heated up and got invisible in @xcite .",
    "the length reflects the survival time scale of the ionized gas in the cluster . though the uncertainty is large , the estimated masses of the ionized gas of eigs in 1367   are larger than those in the coma by about an order , while the difference in the length of eigs is about twice .",
    "the mean surface brightness in  is also brighter in eigs in 1367 .",

    "this supports the assumption that b4 is a part of the tail .",
    "the sf blobs near orphan2 align almost perpendicularly to the  filament from orphan2 ( figure [ fig : orphanssfr ] ) . though sf blobs are resolved into several compact sources in b and images before smoothing , they are merged in psf matched images , and we measured the magnitude as a whole in table [ tab : sfrs ] .    in figure [",
    "fig : orphanssfr_stamp ] right , several residuals remain in  image . figure [ fig : orphanssfr_stamp ] center , b , r , and i composite is shown as a reference ; the objects that show orange  yellow color in b , r , and i composite are not sf blobs , and the  excess are fake , because of psf mismatch , and disappear in psf matched  image .    in broadband images , a faint stream is seen near the sf blobs . b - band image is shown as [ fig : orphanssfr ] bottom - left .",
    "because  is weak along the stream ( figure [ fig : orphanssfr_stamp ] ) the stream would be stars and might be a tidal tail .",
    "the stream seems to connect two galaxies , sdss  j114425.39 + 200923.2 , and sdss  j114426.00 + 201001.8 across the orphan2 filament .",
    "their projected distance is 18.3 kpc , if they are at the 1367 distance . at the opposite side of sdss",
    "j114426.00 + 201001.8 , the stream is vague but possibly reaches to the udg , which is about 34 kpc away from the south galaxy ( sdss  j114425.39 + 200923.2 ) . as the three galaxies , sdss  j114425.39 + 200923.2 , sdss  j114426.00 + 201001.8 , and the udg does not have spectroscopic information , the galaxies may not be an 1367 member . meanwhile ,",
    "as the sf blobs show strong excess in , they would be in 1367 .",
    "as the sf blobs align to the blue stream perpendicular to the  filament of orphan2 , and they are 48 kpc away from the  filament , they would be an accidental overlap on the orphan clouds . in table",
    "[ tab : clouds ] , the flux of orphan2 therefore does not include the sf blobs .",
    "we investigated  images of 1367 taken with suprime - cam , and made a catalog of extended ionized gas clouds ( eigs ) and their parents .",
    "though 1367 is one of the best - studied clusters , we added six new eigs to enable a statistical discussion and a comparison with eigs in the coma cluster .",
    "the deep  image also revealed that the  tails are extended in fainter surface brightness much longer than previously known .",
    "the tail of blue infalling group(big ) shows a sign of winding which could be a result of motion of galaxies inside the group .",
    "we also found several candidates of star - forming blobs ( sf blobs ) far from parent galaxies .",
    "the comparison of the parent galaxies of eigs in 1367 and in the coma cluster showed that the properties of the parents are basically similar . meanwhile",
    "the length of eigs is longer and more often connected to star - forming parents in 1367 .",
    "the difference suggests that the eigs and parents in 1367 are , on average , younger than those in the coma cluster , and in 1367 , the gas removal from the parent and/or the heating of eig is slower .",
    "it would reflect a different evolutionary stage of the clusters .",
