    "<S> , it can be observed that for large @xmath54 , the coupling diffusion coefficients vanish . </S>",

    "<S> this implies that an adjacent membrane within this distance ( @xmath94 ) can have a strong bearing on the diffusion dynamics such as for typical stacked supported membrane experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the presence of the second membrane can enhance the effective coupling diffusion .    </S>",
    "<S> even though the model presented in this communication captures the essential physics , it looks somewhat simplistic in several respects . we have neglected the finite size effect of the membrane inclusions which are known to modify the membrane response at small inter - particle distances  @xcite . at distances </S>",
    "<S> much larger than the inclusion size , however , these effects become unimportant . </S>",
    "<S> curvature effects of the membrane is significant when the radius of curvature is of the order of the hydrodynamic screening length @xmath37  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of our work to membranes in spherical configuration is possible . </S>",
    "<S> the out - of - plane fluctuations of the membrane lead to a reduction in the diffusion coefficient of proteins in the single membranes  @xcite . however , it is known that the presence of a substrate or the second membrane would suppress the out - of - plane membrane fluctuations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we expect that fluctuations and the presence of a substrate will not qualitatively affect our results .    to summarize , we have calculated the longitudinal as well as transverse coupling diffusion coefficients of particles undergoing brownian motion in a stacked double membrane geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the additional contribution to the coupling diffusion coming from the proximity to adjacent membranes . </S>",
    "<S> as in biological systems such as tissues , the cells are rarely isolated , our results also imply that the proximity to neighboring cells can affect the diffusion of objects in cell membranes .    </S>",
