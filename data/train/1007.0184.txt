    "for both mathematical and physical reasons one would like to be able to understand anisotropic and inhomogeneous cosmological models in general . as a first step spatially homogeneous spacetimes can be studied . for the case where the matter model is a perfect fluid a lot of results",
    "have been already obtained which are summarized in @xcite , see also @xcite for a critical discussion .",
    "usually in observational cosmology it is assumed that there exists an era which is `` matter - dominated '' where the matter model is a perfect fluid with zero pressure , i.e. the dust model . a kinetic description via collisionless matter enables to study the stability of this model in the following sense .",
    "suppose we have an expanding universe where the particles have certain velocity dispersion .",
    "one might think that due to the expansion the velocity dispersion will decay . that this is true has been shown in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) models in the cases of bianchi i , ii and iii .",
    "these results have been generalized ( in a different direction ) to lrs bianchi ix and in a context which also goes beyond collisionless matter in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ the lrs models can be diagonalized in a suitable frame where they then stay diagonal if one makes some extra assumptions on the distribution function .",
    "a natural question is , what happens if the model is not diagonal ? in this paper we will treat the late time dynamics of the _ non - diagonal _ bianchi i case assuming small data .",
    "that this makes sense was established in @xcite where it was shown that geodesic completeness holds for the general bianchi i - vlasov case . in a sense which will be specified later , we assume that the universe is close to isotropic and that the velocity dispersion of the particles is bounded .",
    "then we conclude that the universe will isotropize and have a dust - like behaviour asymptotically .",
    "in fact these two properties are intimately linked in the proof , something which is not expected to happen in other bianchi types , except in the case of a positive cosmological constant where it has been shown @xcite that isotropization and asymptotic dust - like behaviour occurs in all bianchi models except bianchi ix and without the lrs assumption .",
    "+ we hope to be able to extend this result in the near future a ) to other bianchi types , where the spacetime does not ( necessarily ) isotropize , but some other solution still may act as an attractor b ) to remove the small data assumption(s ) .",
    "a _ bianchi spacetime _ is defined to be a spatially homogeneous spacetime whose isometry group possesses a three - dimensional subgroup @xmath4 that acts simply transitively on the spacelike orbits .",
    "they can be classified by the structure constants of the lie algebra associated to the lie group .",
    "we will only consider the simplest case where the structure constants vanish , i.e. the case of bianchi i with the abelian group of translations in @xmath5 as the lie group , where the metric has the following form using gauss coordinates : @xmath6    we will use the 3 + 1 decomposition of the einstein equations as made in @xcite .",
    "we use gauss coordinates , which implies that the lapse function is the identity and the shift vector vanishes , so comparing our metric with ( 2.28 ) of @xcite we have that @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the only non - trivial christoffel symbols are the following ( see ( 2.44)-(2.49 ) of @xcite ) : @xmath9 in terms of coordinate expressions we have then that ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the energy density , matter current and energy momentum tensor respectively . in the 3 + 1 formulation the second fundamental form @xmath15 is used and rewriting its definition as in ( 2.29 ) of @xcite we have : @xmath16 using the einstein equations as in ( 2.34 ) of @xcite and the fact that @xmath17 does not depend on the spatial variables , we have : @xmath18 where we have used the notations @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "it has been assumed that the cosmological constant vanishes . from the constraint equations ( 2.26)-(2.27 ) of @xcite : @xmath21 and we see that no matter current is present since the `` spatial '' christoffel symbols vanish : @xmath22 from ( [ c ] ) we see that @xmath23 never vanishes except for the minkowski spacetime .",
    "we exclude this case and assume now without loss of generality that @xmath24 for all time .",
    "if this is not true for a given solution it may be arranged by doing the transformation @xmath25 .",
    "+ for the matter model we will take the point of view of kinetic theory .",
    "this means that we have a collection of particles ( in a cosmological context the particles are galaxies or clusters of galaxies ) which are described statistically by a non - negative distribution function @xmath26 which is the density of particles at a given spacetime point with given four - momentum .",
    "we will assume that all the particles have equal mass ( one can relax this condition if necessary , see @xcite ) .",
    "we want that our matter model is compatible with our symmetry assumption , so we will also assume that @xmath27 does not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to that we will assume that there are no collisions between the particles .",
    "in this case the distribution function satisfies the vlasov equation ( see ( 3.38 ) of @xcite ) : @xmath29 where f is defined on the set determined by the equation @xmath30 called the mass shell .",
    "the energy momentum tensor is ( compare with ( 3.37 ) of @xcite ) : @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for this kind of matter all the energy conditions hold . in particular @xmath34 .",
    "our system of equations consists of the equations ( [ a])-([cu ] ) . for a given bianchi i geometry the vlasov equation",
    "can be solved explicitly with the result that if @xmath27 is expressed in terms of the covariant components @xmath35 then it is independent of time .",
    "this has the consequence that if @xmath36 is some fixed time and @xmath37 then we can express the non - trivial components of the energy momentum tensor as follows : @xmath38      a useful relation concerns the determinant of the metric ( ( 2.30 ) of @xcite ) : @xmath39=-2 h \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking the trace of the mixed version of the second fundamental form ( 2.36 of @xcite ) : @xmath40 with ( [ c ] ) one can eliminate the energy density and ( [ i m ] ) reads : @xmath41 we can decompose the second fundamental form introducing @xmath42 as the trace - free part : @xmath43 then @xmath44 and ( [ in ] ) takes the following form : @xmath45 it is obvious that @xmath46 from the constraint equation ( [ c ] ) and ( [ yes ] ) it also follows that @xmath47    from ( [ ie ] ) and ( [ up ] ) we conclude that @xmath48    let us use the following notation : @xmath49 this quantity is related to the so called _ shear parameter",

    "i is the friedmann model with flat spatial geometry .",
    "the metric in this case is : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the scale factor . in this case @xmath65 which means that @xmath66 and also that @xmath54 .",
    "+ moreover in the dust case @xmath67 ( the einstein - dust system can be thought of as singular case of the einstein - vlasov system , see chapter 3.4 of @xcite for more information ) and we can solve ( [ yes ] ) obtaining : @xmath68 we can also write down the explicit solution of the metric in this case : @xmath69 this is also called the einstein - de sitter model .",
    "let us look at the dust case not necessarily isotropic .",
    "the general solution is known and one can see from the solution ( 11 - 1.12 ) of @xcite that the spacetime will isotropize .",
    "nevertheless we will analyze this case with care , since we will show that the general case behaves asymptotically like it assuming small data . in the dust case : @xmath70 we are interested in the asymptotic behaviour at late times and will assume that @xmath71 is small , i.e. : @xmath72 .",
    "then it follows from ( [ yes ] ) : @xmath73 integration leads to @xmath74 using this inequality in ( [ dd ] ) and integrating : @xmath75 we can put the equality ( [ hd ] ) in the following form : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is @xmath78 now we will use the fact that we can choose freely the time origin setting @xmath79 . note that for the general bianchi i symmetric einstein - vlasov - system we know that @xmath23 takes all values in the range @xmath80 ( lemma 2.1 of @xcite )",

    "however we used a different kind of restriction namely the small data assumptions .",
    "+ in any case we think it interesting to study the non - diagonal case because although this time there was not an essential difference in the result with respect to the diagonal case , we do not expect that this will always be the case , especially when analyzing the initial singularity . in @xcite",
    "the possible dynamical behaviour towards the past has been determined assuming only the reflection symmetry and already there surprising new features like the existence of heteroclinic networks arose .",
    "+ the situation of several ( tilted ) fluids leads naturally to the non - diagonal case .",
    "the bianchi i - symmetry implies the absence of a matter current such that a single _ tilted _ fluid is not compatible with this assumption .",
    "however there can be several tilted fluids such that the total current vanishes . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "this has been considered in the case of two fluids .",
    "what was found is that isotropization occurs if at least one of the two fluids has a speed of sound which is less or equal @xmath0 the speed of light .",
    "it is shown in particular for the case of two pressure free fluids in @xcite , which can be seen as a singular solution of the einstein - vlasov system .",
    "+ of course there are many other ways of generalizing results which have been obtained for ( single ) perfect fluids .",
    "see for instance @xcite and references therein for the inclusion of a maxwell field in the bianchi i case . in presence of a cosmological constant",
    "the results of @xcite have been generalized even to the einstein - vlasov - maxwell case @xcite .",
    "a natural generalization of the vlasov equation is the case where the collision term is not zero , i.e. the boltzmann equation . for this case",
    "dust - like asymptotics have already been obtained in @xcite for an isotropic spacetime with a cosmological constant and @xcite provides a basis for a possible extension to the asymptotics in the case of bianchi i with lrs symmetry .",
