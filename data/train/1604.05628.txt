    "in collision - poor plasmas from space large deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium can not be relaxed by the particle - particle ( coulomb ) collisions , but can presumably be constrained by the resulting kinetic instabilities .",
    "thus , if the solar wind expands adiabatically the cgl invariants conserve @xcite leading to an indefinite increase of temperature in the direction parallel to the inteplanetary magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath0 .",
    "however , the in - situ measurements do not confirm such an increase of their parallel temperature with heliocentric distance , but indicate bounds of the temperature anisotropy of plasma particles @xcite . because collisions are not efficient , the most invoked mechanism that can limit the increase of parallel temperature is the firehose instability @xcite .",
    "the firehose instability driven by the anisotropic electrons with @xmath1 , also known as the electron firehose instability ( efhi ) , is particularly important as it can mediate a resonant transfer of ( free ) energy from electrons to protons @xcite .",
    "this energy transfer from small to large scales is facilitated by the quasi - parallel efh modes , which are left - handed ( lh ) circularly polarized and have characteristic frequencies and growth rates in the range of the proton cyclotron frequency .",
    "besides the propagating ( non - zero frequency ) modes predominant at small angles ( quasi - parallel ) with respect to the magnetic field direction , the firehose instability may destabilize an additional aperiodic ( non - propagating ) branch which exists only for oblique directions @xcite .",
    "although it is well known that the suprathermal populations are ubiquitous in the solar wind @xcite , the anisotropic temperature is in general quantified by a bi - maxwellian distribution function , which is relevant only for the thermal core of the solar wind electrons . in this case the aperiodic fhi is found to grow faster than the propagating modes , and the instability thresholds approach well enough the limits of the core anisotropy reported by the observations @xcite . for anisotropies exceeding these thresholds ,",
    "the free energy is dissipated by the resulting instabilities , which may also scatter particles back towards quasi - equilibrium states and prevent the anisotropy to grow @xcite . instead , for the suprathermal electrons from the solar wind the limits of their anisotropy",
    "are markedly departed from the instability thresholds derived for bi - maxwellian populations , see figure  6 and the analysis in @xcite .",
    "this disagreement may simply be motivated by the fact that suprathermal populations can not be properly described by the maxwellian distribution functions , but they can be accurately reproduced by the kappa power - laws @xcite .",
    "ubiquitous in the solar wind and subsequent planetary environments , e.g. , terrestrial magnetosphere , see the review by @xcite , suprathermal electrons are more dilute but hotter than the core populations .",
    "the relaxation through the particle - particle collisions is even less efficient in this case , but kinetic instabilities are expected to explain the limits of temperature anisotropy reported by the observations .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a refined analysis of the suprathermal electrons by using a bi - kappa distribution function to describe the anisotropy of these populations . in the limit of a high power - index @xmath2",
    "the ( bi-)kappa distribution function reduces to a ( bi-)maxwellian . @xcite and @xcite",
    "have used the bi - kappa model to quantify the velocity distributions and the principal properties of the suprathermal electrons in the solar wind , e.g. , the components of the anisotropic temperature , parallel ( @xmath3 ) and perpedicular ( @xmath4 ) to the magnetic field direction .",
    "the suprathermal electrons are found to be highly anisotropic and with a predominant excess of parallel temperature susceptible to the fhi .",
    "the bi - kappa model was also extensively invoked in theories of dispersion and stability by adopting two alternative assumptions for the temperature of kappa populations , to be either dependent or independent of the power - index @xmath5 .",
    "studies of the fhi @xcite assume @xmath5-independent temperatures , and find , contrary to the expectations , that the instability is inhibited by the suprathermals and the instability thresholds do not approach but depart even more from the anisotropy bounds of the solar wind suprathermal electrons .",
    "however , from a recent analysis on the applicability of kappa distributions @xcite it becomes evident that a representation with a @xmath5-dependent temperature may provide a more natural interpretation of the suprathermal populations for three fundamental reasons : ( 1 )  it corresponds to a maxwellian limit which reproduces more accurately the thermal ( core ) population enabling for a direct and realistic comparison @xcite ; ( 2 )  the kinetic instabilities show a systematic stimulation in the presence of suprathermal electrons @xcite as one may expect from the excess of free energy acumulated by these populations ; and ( 3 )  the observations show strong evidence of @xmath5-dependent temperatures , which increase in the presence of suprathermal populations , i.e. , temperatures increase with decreasing the power - index @xmath5 @xcite .    motivated by these premises , here we re - analyse the instability of the efh mode by modeling the suprathermal electrons with a bi - kappa approach with @xmath5-dependent temperatures . in this preliminary analysis",
    "we restrict to the same parallel ( non - zero frequency ) modes studied before by @xcite .",
    "the bi - kappa approach is introduced in section  2 , enabling us to derive the dispersion relation for the fhi modes .",
    "the main features of the instability , are derived and discussed in section  3 .",
    "in addition , the efh thresholds are compared with the observations of the suprathermal electron anisotropy .",

    "this data set comprises more than 120 000 events detected by three space missions ( helios 1 , cluster ii , and ulysses ) at different heliocentric distances ( in the interval 0.33.95  au ) in the ecliptic . the details about the electron analyzers used by these missions , and the methods of correction and reconstruction of the 3d velocity distribution functions",

    "these authors have used the same set of events to analyze the temperature anisotropy of the main electron populations , namely , the thermal core and suprathermal halo , and the most plausible constraints exercised on their temperature anisotropy by different physical mechanisms , e.g. , collisions and kinetic instabilities .",
    "however , @xcite have limited to investigate in detail only the bi - maxwellian core anisotropy finding that the particle - particle collisions still may have an effect to constrain low levels of anisotropy , while the kinetic instabilities occur for larger deviations from isotropy , which exceed their thresholds .",
    "indeed , the instability thresholds predicted by a bi - maxwellian model are found to shape very well the limits of the core anisotropy , but the same thresholds can not explain the limits observed for the temperature anisotropy of suprathermal electrons . figure  6 from @xcite presents such a comparison between the observational data and the efhi thresholds predicted by a bi - maxwellian approach , which is also reproduced here in figure  [ f5 ] by the dotted line corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , in figure  [ f5 ] we show that this disagreement may be resolved by the instability thresholds derived for bi - kappa models which are more appropriate to describe the suprathermal electrons .",
    "the instability thresholds are markedly changed with decreasing the power index @xmath5 and for lower values of @xmath5 these thresholds are approaching the limits of the temperature anisotropy observed in the solar wind .",
    "what we found even more interesting is that the instability thresholds also shape very well the isocontours of the observational data , counting the number of events in the bottom panel .",
    "developing for large temperature anisotropies exceeding these thresholds , the fhi dissipates the free energy and enhances the electromagnetic fluctuations , which may also prevent the anisotropy to grow by scattering particles back towards quasi - equilibrium states .",
    "given that suprathermal electrons in the solar wind are practically collisionless , such a good agreement between the instability thresholds predicted by the kinetic theory and the limits of the temperature anisotropy reported by the observations represents an important confirmation on the role played by the fhi instability in the relaxation process .",
    ".fitting parameters for thresholds @xmath69 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have proposed a refined theory of the electron firehose instability in anisotropic kappa distributed plasmas , which provide a new and , in our opinion , valuable evidence of an extended implication of this instability in the relaxation of the temperature anisotropy in collision - poor plasmas from space .",
    "our present study is particularly motivated by the solar wind observations which do not confirm the indefinite increase of temperature predicted by the solar wind expansion in the direction parallel to the interplanetary magnetic field , but reveal very clear bounds for the temperature anisotropy of plasma particles .",
    "previous studies have focused to the thermal ( core ) populations of electrons and protons , using standard bi - maxwellian approaches , and have shown that large deviations from isotropy are constrained by the kinetic instabilities @xcite .",
    "however , the same bi - maxwellian is not appropriate to describe suprathermal populations and their anisotropy , and can not prescribe accurately the resulting instabilities and their back reaction on these populations .",
    "here we have assumed the anisotropic electrons well reproduced by the bi - kappa distribution function , which is the empirical model invoked by @xcite to describe the velocity distribution of suprathermal electrons in the solar wind .",
    "in addition , the temperature of the suprathermal population is considered dependent on the power - index @xmath5 , enabling us a realistic interpretation of the suprathermals and their effects ( theoretical and observational arguments are detailed in the introduction ) .",
    "the results of our present study contrast with those provided by @xcite and @xcite , who studied the same efhi but driven by bi - kappa electrons with a @xmath5-independent temperature .",
    "these differences are made clear in the discussion from this section .",
    "two distinct regimes of the efhi are identified in section  3 , and these regimes are differentiated by the wave - number dispersion laws ( curves ) obtained for the wave - frequency and growth - rate of the instability .",
    "thus , more specific to the efhi are the unstable lh - polarized modes exemplified in figures  [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] with frequencies that can significantly exceed the proton cyclotron frequency @xmath48 .",
    "for this regime to be established , the kinetic free energy of the anisotropic electrons must be sufficiently large , and this usually means a high enough plasma beta or a large anisotropy .",
    "if damped , these modes can not extend above @xmath48 and their wave - number dispersion keeps the aspect of low - frequency emic modes in the absence of kinetic anisotropies . at higher wave - numbers ( lower scales ) these damped modes can change their polarity converting to the branch of rh - polarized modes ( whistlers ) .",
    "these electromagnetic modes with a wave - number dispersion resembling that of the emic modes , i.e. , with wave - frequency increasing asymtotically to @xmath48 , can be driven unstable by the efhi for conditions approaching marginal stability .",
    "a few cases relevant for this new regime are presented in figures  [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , with mention that top panels include unstable solutions representative for a transition between these two distinct branches of the efhi .",
    "we should observe that considering plasma parameters with values typical for the solar wind conditions , e.g. , in figures  [ f1]-[f4 ] , the efhi develops only in the presence of suprathermal electrons , i.e. , for finite values of @xmath5 , while for ( bi-)maxwellian limit @xmath2 these modes are damped .",
    "increasing the presence of suprathermal populations ( by lowering @xmath5 ) has opposite effects on the wave - frequency of the unstable modes , which become evident if we compare for instance figures  [ f2 ] and [ f4 ] .",
    "however , the efhi is clearly stimulated by the suprathermal electrons , which enhance the ( maximum ) growth - rates in both these two regimes .",
    "noticeable is the significant increase shown by the growth - rates for conditions approaching the marginal stability ( figure  [ f3 ] ) , which can also explain the significant decrease of the instability thresholds shown in figure  [ f5 ] .",
    "these thresholds are markedly lowered with decreasing @xmath5 , and for lower values of @xmath5 they shape very well the limits of temperature anisotropy reported by the observations in the solar wind . in the previous studies involving bi - kappa electrons with a @xmath5-independent temperature , e.g. , in @xcite , the existence of these two distinct regimes was not mentioned , and , in contrast to our present results , the suprathermals were found inhibiting the efhi , and departing the instability thresholds from the limits of temperature anisotropy in the solar wind .",
    "our present results strongly suggest that the efhi may efficiently constrain the temperature anisotropy of the suprathermal electrons in the slow wind , complementing the results by @xcite , which showed the same effects of this instability on the core electrons .",
    "a good agreement between the instability thresholds and the bounds of the temperature anisotropy measured in the solar wind is conditioned by a proper modelling of the velocity distributions in accord to the observations . in conclusion",
    ", the efhi can be considered a plausible mechanism of electron energy transfer between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the uniform magnetic field . from an extended perspective",
    ", we can further claim that the resulting low - frequency fluctuations can establish an energy transfer from small to large scales , namely from the electrons , especially the energetic or suprathermal electrons which carry the main heat flux in the solar wind , to the resonant protons . although suprathermal populations are not easily captured in numerical experiments , it becomes however clear that our present results provide valuable premises that may stimulate new and advanced simulations to confirm these mechanisms .",
