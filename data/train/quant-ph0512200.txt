    "the capacity of a transmission channel is an important quantity in several aspects , ranging from fundamental theoretical issues to technology ; it is therefore intensively studied in classical @xcite and quantum @xcite information theory .",
    "the capacity of a channel depends on different factors , like the type of information that one wants to transmit , the character of the physical material that realizes the transfer , the constraints that exist on the channel , the assistance that is available for the information transfer , etc .",
    "the capacity of a channel for the transmission of classical information by using quantum states is an important example , which has attracted a lot of interest recently . in this respect ,",
    "a fundamental result , obtained more than 30 years ago , is the `` holevo bound '' @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an essential message conveyed by the holevo bound is that _ at most @xmath0 bits ( binary digits ) of classical information can be carried by a quantum system of @xmath0 distinguishable qubits ( two - dimensional quantum systems)_. however , the holevo bound includes arbitrary encoding and decoding strategies .",
    "this has the consequence that for information transmission with infinite dimensional systems through noiseless channels , e.g. with the modes of an electromagnetic field , the holevo bound predicts infinite capacities .",
    "a similar situation appears also for the capacity of transmitting quantum information , merely by definition .    to avoid such nonphysical values , it is important to introduce the relevant physical constraints , while maximizing over the classical or quantum information that can be encoded in a physical system .",
    "classical capacities of channels that carry photons in the form of modes of an electromagnetic field have been studied extensively in the last decade @xcite . in this case , as well as for the quantum capacity ,",
    "as considered in this paper , the natural choice is an energy constraint on the input states of the channel .    in this paper",
    ", we will deal with channels carrying particles that have a non - vanishing mass .",
    "such a problem is motivated by recent experiments producing atomic waveguides in optical microstructures @xcite , or in atom chips @xcite .",
    "these experiments indicate a new possibility of using massive particles in quantum channels for classical as well as quantum communication over macroscopic , or at least mesoscopic distances . for such massive particles ,",
    "it is natural to put an average particle number constraint along with an average energy constraint on the input state of the channel .",
    "we will show that with these constraints , the grand canonical ensemble of statistical mechanics attains the classical as well as quantum capacity of noiseless channels that carry trapped noninteracting massive particles .",
    "we show that the classical and quantum capacities in the case of noiseless quantum channels ( with the above physical constraints ) are the same . therefore in the remainder of this paper , the phrase `` capacity of ( quantum ) channels carrying massive particles '' ( usually implicitly implying that the constraints on energy and particle numbers are already taken into account ) , unless with the specific adjective , will mean the classical as well the quantum capacity .",
    "we should mention here that sometimes , it is more natural to consider the average energy constraint with a fixed number of particles . in this case , the capacity is attained in the canonical ensemble .",
    "calculations of different properties of the canonical ensemble are usually very hard , as compared to the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "however , several studies indicate that the two ensembles give similar values for the average occupation numbers even for finite , but moderately large number of particles @xcite . however , there are physical quantities of interest that give drastically different values . for example",
    ", the fluctuation in the average number of particles in a bose einstein condensate is unphysically large according to the grand canonical ensemble , while that in the canonical ensemble is physically meaningful @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the grand canonical ensembles , for finding the capacities of channels carrying massive particles .",
    "the capacities , being dependent only on the average occupation numbers , will be similar already for a moderately large number of particles .    noninteracting bosons exhibit a critical phenomenon , the bose einstein condensation ( bec ) . in this paper",
    ", we will show that the capacity of channels carrying noninteracting bosons also exhibit this criticality with temperature .",
    "the capacity changes its behavior from being concave to convex ( with respect to temperature ) , at the critical temperature .",
    "noninteracting fermions do not show any critical behavior .",
    "however , interacting fermions can exhibit the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) transition . as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the channel capacity in this case also indicates the bcs transition .",
    "it should be noted here that the convexity and concavity , that we speak about in this paper , are always with respect to temperature , and not with respect to mixing of states .",
    "an important motivation of this study is to compare the capacities of channels carrying bosons with that of fermions .",
    "we will obtain the following result analytically : + _ capacities of noiseless quantum channels carrying noninteracting spinless fermions are higher than that of spinless bosons for a wide range of power law potentials for sufficienly high temperatures .",
    "_    since we obtain the above result by using perturbation theory up to the third order , it holds already for moderate temperatures .",
    "note that our numerical simulations indicate that fermions are better carriers of information than bosons even in the low temerature region .",
    "it may be noted that although the quantum channel that we consider in the paper is noiseless , the states that are used to encode the information are allowed to be noisy ( mixed states encoding ) . in the case of classical capacity",
    ", it will turn out that there exist ensembles of pure states , which can be used to encode the classical information ( to be transferred ) , for attaining the maximal information transfer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - holevo ] , we discuss the holevo bound on classical information transmission . we define the classical capacity of quantum channels in the next section ( sec .",

    "[ sub - ghuri ] , we consider the situation when there is a constraint on the average number of particles , while there is _ no _ constraint on the ( exact or average ) number of particles . in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ kapakapa ] ) , we discuss the capacities of quantum channels with constrained inputs .",
    "we then briefly discuss the capacities of channels carrying photons in sec .",
    "[ sec - photo ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec - mota ] , we consider spinless noninteracting bosons and fermions , and calculate the capacity of channels in these cases . in sec .",
    "[ sec - ghyama ] , we prove a theorem stating that fermions can carry more information ( classical and quantum ) than bosons . in sec .",
    "[ sec - jotota - bhebechhilum - totota - soja - noi ] , we consider the low temperature case , for the 3d box and the 3d harmonic trap . for both these cases , the fermionic capacity is again higher than the bosonic one for sufficiently low temperatures . in the last section ( sec .",
    "[ sec - sesh ] ) , we make some concluding remarks .",
    "this paper presents on one hand the results of ref .",
    "@xcite with more details , and on the other hand generalizes them to the case of trapped non - interacting bosonic and fermionic gases for a large class of power law potentials .",
    "let us note that many of such potentials are feasible with currently available technology .",
    "we will see that the signature of bec in the channel capacity in the case of a harmonic trap , is more pronounced than that in the case of a uniform trap , as considered in ref .",
    ".    it may be worthwhile to mention here that the mathematics required for obtaining the capacities , is similar to that in quantum statistical mechanics , where one maximizes the entropy under different constraints .",
    "this is not very surprising , as the bounds on information transfer , discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec - holevo ] and [ quantumcapa ] , are `` entropy - like '' quantities .",
    "the holevo bound is an upper bound on the amount of classical information that can be accessed from a quantum ensemble in which the information is encoded .",
    "suppose therefore that a sender alice ( @xmath1 ) obtains the classical message @xmath2 , and she knows that this happens with probability @xmath3 .",
    "she wants to send it to a receiver bob ( @xmath4 ) . to do so",
    ", alice encodes the information @xmath2 in a quantum state @xmath5 , and sends the quantum state to bob .",
    "bob receives the ensemble @xmath6 , and wants to obtain as much information as possible about @xmath2 , for which he performs a measurement , that gives the result @xmath7 , with probability @xmath8 .",
    "let the corresponding post - measurement ensemble be @xmath9 .",
    "the classical information gathered can be quantified by the mutual information between the message index @xmath2 and the measurement outcome @xcite : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the shannon entropy of the probability distribution @xmath12 . throughout the paper , we calculate the all the quantities on amounts of information transfer in bits ( binary digits ) .",
    "note that the mutual information can be seen as the difference between the initial disorder and the ( average ) final disorder .",
    "bob will be interested to obtain the maximal information , which is the maximum of @xmath13 over all measurement strategies .",
    "this quantity is called the accessible information : @xmath14 where the maximization is over all measurement strategies .",
    "the maximization involved in the definition of accessible information is usually hard to compute , and hence it is important to know bounds on @xmath15 @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a universal upper bound , called the holevo bound ( or holevo quantity ) , on @xmath15 is given ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the average ensemble state , and @xmath18 is the von neumann entropy of @xmath19 .",
    "consider a quantum channel @xmath20 that acts on @xmath21-dimensional quantum systems as inputs .",
    "suppose that alice wants to send some classical information @xmath2 , that occurs with probability @xmath3 , through this quantum channel to bob .",
    "she encodes this classical information in the quantum state @xmath5 , where the hilbert space corresponding to the quantum states @xmath5 is @xmath21-dimensional .",
    "the classical capacity of this quantum channel is the maximal classical information that can be sent through this channel , and is therefore the accessible information of the ensemble @xmath22 , maximized over all such ensembles on the @xmath21-dimensional hilbert space @xmath23 : @xmath24 however , capacities are usually defined in an asymptotic sense . therefore , the classical capacity in this case is @xmath25 the holevo bound implies that @xmath26 ,    \\ ] ] and @xmath27 .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ ] ]    the quantity @xmath28 is usually very difficult to handle .",
    "the holevo - schumacher - westmoreland theorem @xcite states that in the particular case when the inputs are products on the tensor product hilbert space @xmath29 , the capacity ( let us denote the capacity in this case by @xmath30 ) is given by @xmath31 . \\ ] ]    for the case of the noiseless quantum channel that carries @xmath21 dimensional quantum states noiselessly , all the above capacities equal to @xmath32 .",
    "this value is attained by any complete orthogonal basis of pure states on @xmath23 .",
    "now for infinite dimensional quantum systems , the channel capacity obtained in this way predicts an unphysical infinite capacity .",
    "this is because the holevo bound itself does not include any constraint on the available physical resources in an actual implementation of the information transfer . in particular ,",
    "arbitrary encoding and decoding schemes are allowed . to avoid this infinite capacity ,",
    "one usually maximizes the accessible information over all ensembles that satisfies certain physical constraints . due to the form of the holevo bound on accessible information , such constrained maximizations are very similar to the ones in statistical mechanics .",
    "the same is true for the case of the quantum capacity which we briefly discuss in the succeeding section , and then in sec .",
    "[ sec - fundamental ] , we briefly discuss some similar constrained maximizations of statistical mechanics .",
    "we now consider the case of sending qubits ( as opposed to bits ) using quantum channels . the quantum capacity can be considered in ( at least ) the following four different situations @xcite : the quantum channel @xmath20 ( acting on @xmath21 dimensional quantum states at its input )    * without the help of additional classical communication ( in this case",
    ", we call the quantum capacity @xmath33 ) , * with an arbitrary amount of forward classical communication ( @xmath34 ) , * with an arbitrary amount of backward classical communication ( @xmath35 ) , * with an arbitrary amount of both - way classical communication ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "let us define the first case , the other definitions being similar .",
    "so , the quantum capacity @xmath33 is @xcite @xmath37 where the supremum is over all such cases when there exists a @xmath38 dimensional subspace @xmath39 , of the total input space @xmath40 , satisfying the average fidelity criterion @xmath41 where no classical communication was used in transferring the input state from the sender to the receiver .    in case of a noiseless channel ,",
    "the fidelity criterion is automatically satisfied , and all the quantum capacities are equal to @xmath32 .",
    "now , if the dimension @xmath21 of the input space is infinite , the capacities are again infinite , as in the case of classical capacity .",
    "there are several remarkable results that are known in the noisy case .",
    "in particular , @xmath33 is the maximum coherent information @xcite : @xmath42,\\ ] ] where the maximization is over all quantum states @xmath43 defined on the hilbert space @xmath23 , @xmath44 is a purification of @xmath43 , and @xmath45 is the identity operator acting on quantum states of the ancillary hilbert space that is required for the purification .",
    "furthermore @xcite , @xmath46",
    "in this section , we discuss the fundamental ensembles in statistical mechanics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "suppose that we have a physical system described by the hamiltonian @xmath47 .",
    "we assume that the system has a fixed particle number @xmath48 , and a fixed energy @xmath49 .",
    "( to be more general , one must allow for fluctuations around @xmath49 and @xmath48 . )",
    "this represents a closed and isolated system .",
    "we want to find the state @xmath50 of the system such that it maximizes the von neumann entropy @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the state a energy @xmath49 and particle number @xmath48 , and where @xmath53 enumerates the degeneracy .",
    "let @xmath54 be the total number of orthogonal states with energy @xmath49 and particle number @xmath48 , so that @xmath55 . since the system is isolated ( as it has fixed energy and fixed number of particles ) , the set @xmath56 spans the allowed hilbert space .",
    "consequently , the maximum entropy is reached by the state @xmath57 which is actually the identity on the allowed hilbert space .",
    "this is the microcanonical state of the system , and the ensemble @xmath58 is called the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "consider next a physical system , described by the hamiltonian @xmath47 , which has a fixed particle number @xmath48 and a fixed _ average _ energy @xmath49 .",
    "the average energy constraint forces every state @xmath59 to follow @xmath60 this physical system represents a closed , but not isolated system",
    ". we again want to find the state @xmath61 of the system such that it maximizes the von neumann entropy @xmath51 .",
    "one finds that @xcite @xmath62 the canonical state of the system .",
    "here @xmath63 , with @xmath64 being the boltzmann constant , and @xmath65 the absolute temperature .",
    "the canonical partition function @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 the state @xmath68 is called the canonical state of the system and the ensemble @xmath69 is called the canonical ensemble , where @xmath70 is the eigensystem of the hamiltonian @xmath47 . just like for the microcanonical ensemble ,",
    "the particle number enters the calculations via the hamiltonian and for determining the allowed hilbert space .",
    "for example , in the calculation of the trace in eq .",
    "( [ snuopoka ] ) , the summation runs over all combinations of different numbers of particles at different energy levels , under the constraint that the sum of all particles in all the levels is @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , for indistinguishable particles , we must also take care about the statistics of the particles . for example , if we have a trap , whose energy levels are @xmath71 , and in which @xmath48 noninteracting spinless bosons are trapped , so that the bosons are described by the hamiltonian @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are creation and destruction operators of the @xmath2th mode ) , we have @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the number of particles at energy level @xmath71 . for a given value of energy @xmath49 , the temperature @xmath65 is given by @xmath77 .",
    "the next step is to consider a physical system , described by the hamiltonian @xmath47 , which has a fixed _ average _ particle number @xmath48 and a fixed _ average _ energy @xmath49 .",
    "the average energy constraint forces every state @xmath59 to follow eq .",
    "( [ eta - holo - energy ] ) , while the average particle number constraint reads @xmath78 where @xmath79 represents the total particle number operator .",
    "for example , for a system of spinless bosons , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath74 are the creation and annihilation operators of the @xmath2th mode .",
    "this physical system represents an open system . we again want to find the state @xmath82 of the system such that it maximizes the von neumann entropy @xmath51 .",
    "one finds that the state is @xcite @xmath83 i.e. , the grand canonical state of the system . here",
    "@xmath84 is the chemical potential",
    ". the grand canonical partition function @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 note that in this case , the number of particles is not fixed , and in particular , @xmath87 in the case of noninteracting spinless bosons in a trap of energy levels @xmath88 , and where we have now denoted the chemical potential by @xmath89 .",
    "the ensemble @xmath90 is the grand canonical ensemble , where the elements of the ensemble runs over all combinations of the @xmath91 s ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "as opposed to the case of the canonical partition function , the grand canonical partition function requires the value of the chemical potential .",
    "we can determine the chemical potential from the constraint on the average particle number constraint , for given values of the temperature and average particle number .",
    "we can then find the grand partition function with these values .",
    "the average occupation numbers , in the case of noninteracting spinless bosons , are given by @xmath93 the average energy is given by @xmath94 .",
    "otherwise , for given values of the average energy and average particle number , the dual constraints on average energy and particle number can be simultaneously solved to obtain the chemical potential , and the temperature .",
    "one may now consider the case , when we do not have a constraint on the number of particles .",
    "in other words , arbitrary numbers of particles are allowed . for the energy",
    ", we still assume that the average energy is fixed to @xmath49 . in this case",
    ", maximizing the entropy leads to the partition function @xmath95 for noninteracting bosons in a trap of energy levels @xmath88 .",
    "note that this partition function is different from the canonical partition function in that there is no constraint on the number of particles ( i.e. the constraint @xmath96 does not exist anymore ) , and from the grand canonical partition function in that the term @xmath97 is absent inside the exponent .    in the case when the lowest energy level is zero or negative ,",
    "at least one of the sums in eq .",
    "( [ satyendranath ] ) is divergent .",
    "such divergence does not occur in @xmath66 , due to the constraint @xmath96 .",
    "neither does it occur in @xmath85 , as the term @xmath97 in the exponent `` cures '' the divergence .",
    "if the lowest energy level is positive , we have @xmath98 and the average occupation number of the @xmath2th level is @xmath99 so that the total average number of particles is @xmath100 while the total average energy is @xmath101 since all the energy levels are positive , these sums are convergent , and so we are not able to approach the `` thermodynamic limit '' ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the thermodynamic limit , i.e. the limiting case of an infinite number of particles can be reached only in the trivial case when @xmath103 .",
    "this for example is the case for photons , in the form of modes of the electromagnetic field in a closed ( finite ) cavity , in which case the zero frequency mode is not populated . with increasing cavity size , one may approach as close as possible to the zero frequency mode , but then the density matrix describing the system ceases , in the limit , to be trace - class .",
    "this problem does not arise in case of the canonical state , as in that case , if the lowest energy level is nonzero ( positive or negative ) , we can define @xmath104 ( @xmath105 is the lowest energy level ) , so that we can rewrite the canonical partition function as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the canonical partition function of a system of @xmath48 noninteracting bosons in a trap with energy levels @xmath108 , and with the lowest energy level vanishing .",
    "the factor @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ sidho ] ) is a constant for given particle number and energy . for the case of the grand canonical state ,",
    "if the lowest energy is nonzero , we again rewrite the grand canonical partition function as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the grand canonical partition function of a system of @xmath48 noninteracting bosons in a trap with energy levels @xmath108 , and with the lowest energy level vanishing , and with a correspondingly changed chemical potential @xmath112 .",
    "the discussion in this subsection so far concerned the case of noninteracting bosons . in the case of noninteracting fermions , the pauli exclusion principle forces the @xmath76 s in eq .",
    "( [ satyendranath ] ) to run from @xmath113 to @xmath114 , so that the partition function in this case is ( we consider `` spinless '' i.e. polarized fermions ) @xmath115 the average occupation numbers in this case are ( we are using the same notation for bosons and fermions ) @xmath116 so that the total number of particles and the total energy have fixed values ( for a given temperature ) , irrespective of the value of the lowest energy level .",
    "therefore , again we are not able to approach the thermodynamic limit , unless @xmath117 .",
    "we now consider the case of quantum channels with constrained inputs .",
    "the motivation for such consideration is the fact that in the noiseless case , the capacities ( both classical and quantum ) are in some cases infinite , and thus calls for putting some realistic constraints on the set - up .    surely , the constraints will depend on the specific realization of the physical system under consideration . in anticipation of the cases that we will consider below",
    ", we put constraints on the average energy and the average number of particles of the input states .",
