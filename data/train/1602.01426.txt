    "the remarkable changes expected for the properties of strongly interacting matter when it is put under extreme conditions are the subject of intense ongoing theoretical and experimental research .",
    "various parameters of phenomenological interest enter the description of such extreme conditions , like temperature , chemical potentials or external background fields .",
    "part of this research consists in the study of the qcd phase diagram , i.e.  in mapping the various phases of strongly interacting matter in equilibrium conditions , and the associated phase transitions and critical points , as a function of those parameters .    at high temperature confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are expected to disappear , and qcd is expected to be described in terms of quark and gluon effective degrees of freedom ( quark - gluon plasma ) .",
    "lattice qcd simulations show that , indeed , a rapid change of properties takes place around a well defined temperature @xmath6 .",
    "there is no compelling reason for expecting a true phase transition , since no exact symmetry of qcd , which could possibly change its realization at @xmath6 , is known : chiral symmetry is exact only for vanishing quark masses , while the @xmath10 center symmetry is exact only in the pure gauge theory , where its spontaneous breaking is associated to deconfinement . in fact , lattice simulations have shown that only a smooth crossover is present in the case of physical quark masses , at a temperature @xmath11 mev  @xcite .",
    "the situation could be different in the presence of other external parameters .",
    "in particular , the crossover could turn into a real transition for large enough baryon chemical potential @xmath2 , starting from a critical endpoint in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "such a critical point , and the associated critical behavior around it , could have a huge impact on strong interactions phenomenology , so that large theoretical and experimental efforts are being dedicated to prove its existence and locate it .",
    "unfortunately , numerical progress by lattice qcd simulations is strongly hindered by the sign problem affecting the path integral formulation at non - zero baryon chemical potential .",
    "there are , however , well defined locations , in an extended qcd phase diagram , where exact symmetries are known for any value of the quark masses .",
    "critical points associated with their spontaneous symmetry breaking are predicted to exist and can be investigated by standard lattice simulations .",
    "this is the case of qcd with a purely imaginary baryon chemical potential  @xcite , the partition function of which is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the qcd hamiltonian , @xmath15 is the baryon charge and @xmath16 .",
    "all physical states of the theory , over which the trace is taken , are globally color neutral and carry an integer valued baryon charge @xmath15 , hence @xmath17 is @xmath18-periodic in @xmath19 , or alternatively @xmath20-periodic in @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the quark chemical potential and @xmath23 is the number of colors . that can also be proven by making use of center transformations in the path - integral formulation of the partition function , as we review in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "on the other hand , in the high-@xmath24 phase , quarks , which carry a baryon charge @xmath25 , become the effective degrees of freedom propagating through the thermal medium : modes which are @xmath18-periodic in @xmath26 , hence @xmath27 periodic in @xmath19 , appear in the functional dependence of the partition function . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath18 periodicity in @xmath19 is possible only through the appearance of a non - analytic behavior in @xmath28 , associated with first order phase transition lines present for @xmath29 or odd multiples of it , which are known as roberge - weiss ( rw ) transitions  @xcite and have been widely studied by lattice qcd simulations  @xcite .    in correspondence with such points ,",
    "analogously to what happens when @xmath19 is a multiple of @xmath18 , the theory is invariant under charge conjugation , but contrary to that case charge conjugation is spontaneously broken at high @xmath24 , where the system develops a non - zero expectation value for the imaginary part of the baryon number density : the temperature @xmath30 where the spontaneous breaking takes place is precisely the endpoint of the roberge - weiss first order transition lines .",
    "an alternative point of view about the same transition is to look at it as a quantum ( i.e. zero temperature ) transition , with an associated spontaneous breaking of charge conjugation , driven by the compactification of one of the spatial directions beyond a critical size @xmath31 ( finite size transition @xcite ) .",
    "since charge conjugation is a @xmath32 symmetry , one expects a @xmath9-ising universality class if the transition is second order , or alternatively a first order transition with the development of a latent heat .",
    "the temperature @xmath30 and the critical behavior to which it is related represent universal properties of strong interactions , directly related to the change in the effective degrees of freedom propagating in the thermal medium , hence to deconfinement .",
    "they can be carefully studied by lattice qcd simulations , since the path integral measure is real and positive for imaginary chemical potentials . despite being related to a critical point located in an unphysical region of the qcd phase diagram ,",
    "their importance and relevance to a full understanding of strong interactions stems from various considerations :    _ i ) _ the rw endpoint may influence physics in a critical region around it .",
    "moreover , if at the rw endpoint a first order transition is present , the endpoint is actually a triple point , with further departing first order lines , the endpoints of which may be even closer to the @xmath33 axis , with more interesting consequences .",
    "_ ii ) _ early studies have shown that the rw endpoint transition is first order for small quark masses , second order for intermediate masses , and again first order for large masses ; the three regions are separated by two tricritical points  @xcite . the emergence of this interesting structure has induced many further studies in effective models @xcite which try to reproduce the essential features of qcd .",
    "moreover , interesting proposals have been made on the connection of this phase structure with that present at @xmath2 = 0 ( the so - called columbia plot ) and on the possibility to exploit the whole phase structure at imaginary chemical potential in order to clarify currently open issues on the phase structure at @xmath33 , like the order of the chiral transition for @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "_ iii ) _ once the rw endpoint has been precisely located , it can be taken as a test ground to compare the lattice techniques presently used to locate the critical point at real @xmath2 , so as to assess their reliability and guide future research on the subject .    _",
    "iv ) _ the relation of the rw endpoint to the other symmetries of qcd , which are present at least in well defined limits of strong interactions , is an interesting issue by itself , which can help elucidate some fundamental non - perturbative properties of the theory .    in this paper",
    "we study the properties of the rw endpoint by lattice simulations of qcd with physical quark masses .",
    "its location @xmath30 is determined for various lattice spacings , corresponding to temporal extensions @xmath35 , and then extrapolated to the continuum limit .",
    "moreover we are able to determine its universality class , through a finite size scaling analysis , at two different lattice spacings , namely @xmath36 .",
    "finally , in order to approach the issue of the interconnection between chiral symmetry and the rw endpoint , we consider the relation of the endpoint location to the analytic continuation of the pseudocritical chiral transition temperature @xmath37 to imaginary chemical potentials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we review the general framework regarding the rw endpoint in a path - integral approach and present details about our numerical setup and the observables used to investigate the critical behavior . in section  [ sec3 ] we report on our numerical results regarding the universality class of the endpoint , the continuum extrapolated value of @xmath30 and its relation with @xmath37 . finally , in section  [ sec4 ] we draw our conclusions .",

    "for a given number of lattice sites in the temporal direction , we can choose the simulated temperature by tuning the value of the bare coupling constant @xmath52 and the quark masses @xmath53 and @xmath54 , in order to change the lattice spacing while remaining on a line of constant physics , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 ; this line has been determined by a spline interpolation of the results reported in refs .",

    "let us now sketch the structure of the phase diagram at imaginary @xmath2 .",
    "this has already been done in the introduction , by considering the effective degrees of freedom at work in the different regimes ; now we will proceed through an analysis of the properties of the path integral . in the presence of a purely baryonic chemical potential ( i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath58 )",
    ", one has @xmath59 .",
    "when @xmath60 is purely imaginary , its introduction is equivalent to a global rotation of fermionic boundary conditions in the temporal direction by an angle @xmath61 , therefore one expects at least a @xmath18-periodicity in @xmath26 ( @xmath62 in @xmath19 ) .",
    "however , the actual periodicity is @xmath63 , since a rotation of the fermionic boundary conditions by that angle is equivalent to a center transformation on the gauge fields , hence it can be reabsorbed without modifying the path integral @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that such a periodicity is smoothly realized at low temperatures @xcite . at high @xmath24 , instead , since the polyakov loop @xmath64 ( trace of the temporal wilson line normalized by @xmath23 ) enters the fermionic determinant expansion multiplied by @xmath65 , the value of @xmath26 selects the true vacuum among the three different minima of the polyakov loop effective potential , which are related to each other by center transformations .",
    "hence , phase transitions occur as @xmath26 crosses the boundary between two different center sectors , i.e. for @xmath66 and @xmath67 integer ( in which case @xmath19 is an odd multiple of @xmath68 ) , where @xmath69 jumps from one center sector to the other  @xcite ; the phase of @xmath64 can serve as a possible order parameter in this case .",
    "the @xmath24-@xmath26 phase diagram then consists of a periodic repetition of first order lines ( rw lines ) in the high-@xmath24 regime , which disappear at low @xmath24 .",
    "therefore they have an endpoint at some temperature @xmath30 , where an exact @xmath32 symmetry breaks spontaneously",
    ". a schematic view of the diagram is reported in fig .",

    "regime , while the dashed lines represent the analytic continuation of the pseudocritical line . ]    an alternative order parameter is represented by any of the quark number densities ( where @xmath70 ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the four dimensional lattice volume .",
    "since @xmath17 is an even function of @xmath2 , each @xmath73 is odd and , for purely imaginary @xmath2 , it is purely imaginary as well .",
    "invariance under charge conjugation , or alternatively oddness and the required @xmath18 periodicity in @xmath19 , implies that @xmath73 vanishes for @xmath29 or integer multiples of it , unless a discontinuity takes place at such points , in correspondence of a spontaneous breaking of charge conjugation invariance .",
    "this is exactly what happens at the rw lines , so that a non - zero @xmath74 signals the onset of the rw transition .    in the following",
    ", it will be convenient to consider one particular rw line , corresponding to @xmath75 , for which the imaginary part of the polyakov loop , together with the imaginary part of the quark number density , can be taken as an order parameter .",
    "the order parameter susceptibility is then defined as latexmath:[\\[\\label{suscdef } \\chi_l \\equiv n_tn_s^3\\ ( \\langle ( { \\rm im}(l))^2 \\rangle - \\langle    ( @xmath50 ) is the spatial ( temporal ) size in lattice units . the susceptibility @xmath77 is expected to scale , moving around the endpoint at fixed @xmath50 and @xmath26 , as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the reduced temperature , which is proportional to @xmath80 close enough to the critical point .",
    "that means that the quantity @xmath81 , measured on different spatial sizes , should lie on the same curve when plotted against @xmath82 .",
    "alternatively , we will consider also the susceptibility of the imaginary part of the quark number density , which is defined , for every flavor @xmath83 , by @xmath84 ^ 2 \\rangle - \\langle    |{\\rm im}(n_q)| \\rangle^2\\big ) \\",

    "in this section we present our numerical results , starting from an analysis of the critical behavior around the rw endpoint transition , in order to assess its order and universality class on lattices with @xmath85",
    ". then we will consider also lattices with @xmath86 in order to provide a continuum extrapolated value for @xmath30 .",
    "since we are interested in studying the behavior near the phase transition , long time histories are required , to cope with the critical slowing down ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : histories ] ) ; for the couplings around the critical value , we used @xmath87 trajectories for each run when performing the finite size analysis .     for @xmath88 and the @xmath52 values closest to the peak of @xmath77 , showing the peculiar features expected near a second order transition : the increase of the autocorrelation time and the absence of a double peak structure in the histogram .",
    "]      the effective theory associated with the spontaneous breaking of the charge conjugation at finite temperature is a three dimensional theory with @xmath32 symmetry , so the transition can be either first order or second order in the three - dimensional ising universality class .",
    "a tricritical scaling is in principle possible as well ; however the tricritical point is just a single point at the boundary of first and second order regions . as a consequence ( apart from the unlikely case of being exactly on it ) tricritical indices can be observed only as scaling corrections , the ultimate large volume behavior being either first order or ising @xmath9  @xcite . the critical indices that will be used in the following are reported for convenience in table  [ tab : critexp ] .",

    "the one obtained using just the three finer lattices , we get our final estimate @xmath92 .          an interesting issue that remains to be investigated is the relation between the rw endpoint and the chiral transition . in particular , the question can be posed in the following way : does the pseudocritical line really get to the rw endpoint , as assumed in fig .",
    "[ figrw ] and as suggested by early studies on the subject ?",
    "a number of investigations appeared recently , reproducing the pseudocritical line for imaginary chemical potentials at or close to the physical point and with the setup of chemical potentials relevant to the rw endpoint , i.e.  @xmath93 , see refs .",
    "@xcite . a possible way to approach",
    "the question is to try extrapolating the location of the pseudocritical line up to @xmath29 on the basis of those determinations . to this aim we considered results for @xmath94 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite on @xmath95 lattices and adopting the same discretization used in the present study . in fig .",
    "[ fig : immu_vero ] , we present two different extrapolations of such data , corresponding to the fit ansatz @xmath96 with or without the sixth order term included ( a simple linear dependence on @xmath97 was excluded in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in both cases",
    "one gets reasonably close , within errors , to the rw endpoint .",
    "of course , the issue can be checked also directly , by determining the location of the pseudocritical line exactly at @xmath29 . to that aim , in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiralsusc ] we plot the renormalized light chiral susceptibility ( as defined , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for lattices with temporal extent @xmath98 , together with the positions of the rw endpoint as previously determined on the same lattices .",
    "it is clearly seen that the location of the maxima of the chiral susceptibility is compatible with the position of the rw endpoints .",
    "for instance for @xmath95 and @xmath99 we obtain , by fitting the chiral susceptibility to a lorentzian peak , @xmath100 , which is at just one standard deviation from the rw endpoint coupling reported in table  [ tab : critbeta ] .",
    "we can thus confirm , within present errors , evidence that the rw endpoint is located at a point where the analytic continuation of the pseudocritical line and the rw first order line meet each other . to conclude , based on this evidence , we have performed a final fit , including terms up to the sixth order in @xmath97 , which includes the rw endpoint as a part of the pseudocritical line .",
    "the result is the dashed line reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : immu_vero ] , which has been continued also to the other center sectors , so as to reproduce a realistic version ( i.e.  for @xmath0 qcd with physical quark masses , even if just for @xmath95 ) of the phase diagram sketched in fig .  [ figrw ] .",
    "lattices alone .",
    "bands denote fits to polynomials in @xmath101 : the orange ( longer ) band is obtained using terms up to order @xmath102 , the violet ( shorter ) one using up to @xmath103 terms . ]     and @xmath104 lattices .",
    "the vertical bands denote the position of the rw endpoint on lattices of the corresponding temporal extent . ]",
    "we have investigated the properties of the rw endpoint by lattice simulations of @xmath0 qcd with physical quark masses and making use of two different order parameters for the transition , namely the imaginary part of the polyakov line and the imaginary part of the quark number density , which have led to consistent results .",
    "the temperature of the endpoint , @xmath30 , has been determined at four different values of the lattice temporal extent , @xmath3 , from which we have obtained a continuum extrapolated value @xmath105 , where the error includes both statistical and systematic contributions , stemming mostly from the determination of the physical scale .",
    "that leads to the estimate @xmath106 , where the error also takes into account the systematics involved in the determination of @xmath6 , originating both from the scale setting and from the difficulties in defining a critical temperature when no real transition is present .",
    "this ratio is significantly larger than the ones obtained in previous studies ; indeed , with unimproved actions , unphysical quark masses and no extrapolation to the continuum limit , @xmath30 was typically found to be only about 10% larger than @xmath6 .",
    "the larger value is partially due to the larger curvature @xmath107 , and partially to the more significant contribution from non - linear terms in @xmath101 ( see eq .  ) which are present in the case @xmath108 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "regarding the order of the transition , our finite size scaling analysis provides evidence that a second order transition of the @xmath9-ising universality class takes place , rather than a first order one , at least for @xmath7 and @xmath8 lattices",
    ". our investigation has been performed at a fixed value of the pion mass , corresponding to its physical value @xmath109 mev .",
    "previous studies on the subject , performed in the @xmath110 theory with both staggered and wilson fermions , have shown that the order of the transition changes as a function of @xmath111 ; in particular , there are two tricritical pion masses , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and the transition is second order for @xmath114 and first order for lighter or heavier pion masses .",
    "the value of the heavy tricritical mass is typically well above the gev scale .",
    "the lighter critical pion mass has been found to be @xmath115 mev for standard staggered fermions on @xmath7 lattices  @xcite , and around 930 and 680 mev for standard wilson fermions on respectively @xmath7  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite lattices . given these results , even if we have studied just the physical value of the pion mass , we can conclude the following : for stout improved staggered fermions , one has @xmath116 mev on both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 lattices .",
    "when compared to previous results , that demonstrates the presence of significant cut - off effects on the values of this tricritical mass , even when working at fixed @xmath50 but with a different action .",
    "moreover , based on the observed tendency of the tricritical mass to decrease with the increase of @xmath50 , we suggest that @xmath117 should be smaller than @xmath118  mev in the continuum limit , so that the rw endpoint should be a second order transition in the continuum limit at the physical pion mass .",
    "we must however remark that the mechanism driving the change of nature of rw endpoint transition , from second to first order as the pion mass decreases , is still unknown . if such a mechanism is related to the chiral properties of quarks , unexpected behaviors could occur as the continuum chiral symmetry group is fully recovered .",
    "this is known to happen , at least for staggered fermions , for lattice spacings well below those explored in the present study ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent investigation about this issue ) .",
    "let us spend a few words about what , in our opinion , future studies should clarify .",
    "first of all , one would like to check the second order nature of the rw endpoint at the physical point on finer lattices , i.e. for @xmath119 .",
    "then , our study with stout improved staggered fermions should be extended to different values of the pion mass , in order to locate the values of the tricritical masses @xmath120 and @xmath113 and possibly extrapolate them to the continuum limit .",
    "such a program , which goes beyond our present computational capabilities , would clarify the universal properties of the only critical point of strong interactions ( in the presence of finite quark masses ) that one can predict _ a priori _ , based on the known symmetries of qcd .",
    "finally , another open issue regards the relation of the rw critical point to those predicted in well defined limits of qcd .",
    "the relation to the deconfinement transition present in the quenched case is obvious , since the two transitions trivially coincide in this case and are both related to center symmetry .",
    "the relation to the chiral transition in the limit of massless quarks is far less trivial .",
    "suppose to move ( varying the temperature ) along the line @xmath29 in the presence of massless quarks ; in principle one expects two different critical temperatures , one at which chiral symmetry is restored , @xmath121 , and one at which the @xmath32 charge conjugation symmetry spontaneously breaks , @xmath30 .",
    "what is the relation between @xmath121 and @xmath30 ?",
    "our present results at finite quark masses prove that the location of the peak of the renormalized chiral susceptibility coincides , within errors , with @xmath30 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : chiralsusc ] , so that the analytic continuation of the pseudocritical line meets the rw line at its endpoint .",
    "however , in order to obtain a definite answer , the issue should be explored while approaching the chiral limit : this is something which goes beyond the purpose of the present study and is left to future investigations .",
