    "we have seen that 2nd born quantum master equation fails in modeling the real light harvesting systems .",
    "the reason is that it is perturbative in nature .",
    "one has to develop non - perturbative theories for the problem . also resent studies with sophisticated 2d photon echo spectroscopy show long livid coherence effects in exciton motion which contradicts the long held old idea of incoherent motion@xcite .",
    "new approaches should explain this by going beyond the perturbation theories or new mathematical framework is needed .",
    "our approach towards the 2nd born master equation enable us ( 1 ) to introduce an efficient numerical scheme , ( 2 ) to quantitatively known the validity regime of the markovian approximation .",
    "we saw that it is inadequate for the present problem . in the last section we introduced a phenomenological approach . in this , we modeled the effect of bath as a stochastic noise and its strength was calculated from motionaly narrowed lineshape .",
    "for this we used kubo s stochastic theory of lineshapes .",
    "significant role was played by the 2d photon echo spectroscopy as we had the important information about motionaly narrowed lineshape .",

    "by taking the matrix elements of equation ( 19 ) @xmath4|2{\\rangle},\\ ] ] one can formally solve for @xmath5 as @xmath6 taking the functional derivative @xmath7 of the above equation wrt @xmath8 and plugging into @xmath9 yields the result equation ( 22 ) .          a brief overview of 2d photon echo spectroscopy is given with an emphasis on the underlying physics of multidimensional echo spectroscopy ( see for details@xcite )",
    ". 2d photon echo spectroscopy ( 2dpes ) is a kind of generalization of the pump - probe spectroscopy ( pps ) . in optical pps , an ultra - short pump pulse with wide bandwidth",
    "creates excitation of various electronic transitions and the subsequent probe pulse selectively measures the transient absorption of the electronic states .",
    "this transient probe absorption is a function of delay time between the pump and the probe pulses .",
    "thus one can get dynamical information ( temporal changes of absorption ) of the relaxation processes .",
    "but the pump - probe spectroscopy is insensitive to the coherences created by the optical excitation whereas 2dpes is coherence sensitive , it can temporally resolve the dynamics of the coherence ( off - diagonal elements of the density matrix ) . in 2dpes three ultra short pulses",
    "are send through the sample .",
    "the first pulse creates the coherence state between the ground and excited states@xmath14 .",
    "this evolves for some time period @xmath15 ( order of femto seconds ) , then the next pulse interacts with this already excited system .",
    "this yields either the ground state @xmath16 or inter - exciton coherence state @xmath17 .",
    "this doubly excited state then evolves for another interval of time called population time @xmath18 until a third pulse interacts with the system .",
    "this third interaction finally yields 3rd order density matrix elements such as @xmath19 which emits an echo signal ( in phase matched direction ) by decaying after a time interval @xmath20 .",
    "this can be used to measure real time dynamics of resonance coupling in fmo systems and this can shed light on the conformal changes in molecular structure such as hydrogen bound breaking ( see below ) .",
    "the usual linear spectroscopic methods like linear absorption or pump - probe spectroscopy can only provide highly averaged information about the system under study , for example , in linear absorption spectra the broadening is both due to homogeneous broadening ( hb ) and inhomogeneous broadening ( ihb ) .",
    "but 2d photon echo spectroscopy can resolve these two contributions .    the way in which it resolves",
    "can be explained as follows .",
    "consider that an ultra - short pulse perturbs the system at time @xmath21 .",
    "consider that our system is composed of several chromophors with different electronic transition frequency ( static in - homogeneity ) and it is interacting with thermal bath ( some protein ) .",
    "the first pulse creates the coherence state between the ground and excited state @xmath14 of a choromophore due to the dipolar matrix elements coupling the ground and excited state ( considering that the light - matter interaction is treated with first order perturbation theory ",
    "weak field regime ) .",
    "we have an ensemble of coherences @xmath22 with a specific phase relation at @xmath21 .",
    "due to static in - homogeneity the phase relation between these density matrix elements will be lost with time ( phase randomness ) but it will re - appear after sufficiently long time ! ( if we consider for the moment that there is no bath and no random perturbation of the phases ) .",
    "let this coherences @xmath23 evolves for some time period @xmath15 ( order of femto seconds ) , then the next ultra short pulse interacts with this already excited and evolving system .",
    "this yields either the ground state populations @xmath16 ( no coherences ) or inter - exciton coherence states @xmath17 .",
    "these doubly excited states then evolves for another interval of time called population time @xmath18 until a third pulse interacts with the system .",
    "this third interaction has an opposite effect and creates the coherences @xmath24 ( which are complex conjugates of the first coherences ) .",
    "the time evolution of this exactly cancel the  phase randomness  developed in the initial time interval @xmath15 ( because evolution operator for @xmath25 is the complex conjugate of the evolution operator for @xmath22 . if there is no bath ( system is isolated ) then after an interval of time @xmath15 the phases again `` cohere '' ( they assume the same distribution as they had at time @xmath21 ) and finally this `` re - locking '' of phases yield an echo signal ( in phase matched direction ) .",
    "now consider that our system is interacting with the bath ( our system is open ) .",
    "this cause a ",
    "stochastic phase randomness `` between the phases of @xmath22 of various chromophors in the ensemble .",
    "if the population time @xmath18 is sufficiently long the phase relationship between density matrix elements of the chromophores will be _ permanently _ lost and and no echo will be seen .",
    "thus , we can say that the maximum population time @xmath26 directly depends upon ( a ) the strength of system - bath coupling , ( b ) measure of the ' ' fastness \" of the bath fluctuations . in kubo",
    "s stochastic theory these are respectively @xmath27 and @xmath28 . thus @xmath26 tell us about the character of homogeneous broadening mechanism .",
    "the @xmath29 correlation or in frequency domain @xmath30 correlation ( along the diagonal direction in 2d spectra ) tell us about the in - homogeneous broadening , as the experiments are done by systematically varying @xmath15 and at a given @xmath15 ( the time gap between the first two pulses ) the amplitude in the 2 d spectrum after that given time @xmath15 from the second pulse ( i.e. , after population time ) show a correlation in the form of the elongation of the peak in the diagonal direction , a direct signature of in - homogeneous broadening .",
    "thus one get the information about both hb and ihb .",
    "2d photon echo spectroscopy can also tell us about the real time resonance coupling dynamics and bond breaking dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ tuning ] ) . consider that we have two tuning forks with characteristic frequencies @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "let us excite this system with a spectrum of frequencies and detect the amplitude of vibration with some frequency analyzer ( some electronic instrument ) and plot various frequencies along the x - axis ( exciting frequencies ) and y - axis ( detecting frequencies ) .",
    "we will see two peaks occurring at @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the `` 2d spectrum '' ( along the diagonal fig .",
    "[ tuning ] ) .    now consider that our tuning forks are coupled by some spring ( say we have weak coupling ) .",
    "then again repeat the experiment and plot the 2d spectrum .",
    "this time we will see , along with the diagonal peaks , two `` cross - peaks '' along the anti - diagonal direction .",
    "these cross peaks are the consequence of coupling .",
    "if we further reduce the spring coupling the magnitude of these cross peaks diminish and finally disappear with our removal of coupling springs .",
    "this mechanical analogy can be directly applied to the changes in the molecular structure . in fig .",
    "1 hydrogen bound breaking dynamics between two chemical groups is shown .",
    "two chemical groups have characteristic frequencies @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "two peaks appear at these frequencies in the 2d photon echo spectrum .",
    "two cross - peaks also appear as shown which is due to the coupling of these two chemical groups .",
    "the coupling is due to the hydrogen bound .",
    "when the bound is broken this cross - peaks also disappear .",
    "this can be tracked in real time by varying the magnitude of the population time .",
    "similarly in the electronic spectrum the cross peaks tell us about the electronic coupling between the chromophores ( the system - system coupling , usually denoted as @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) also called resonance coupling .",
    "the oscillation in the magnitude of the cross peaks show the oscillations of the pigments about their equilibrium positions ( in physical space ) as the variation about the equilibrium position modulate the resonance coupling strength .        here",
    "dipole approximation ( weak variation of the electric field amplitude over the size of the pigment ) is used .",
    "if the magnitude of the above hamiltonian is much weaker than the magnitude of the pigment hamiltonian @xmath36 , then the @xmath37 can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "the dynamics of the total system ( the pigment ) can be described by liouville - von neumann equation for the density matrix @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39\\ ] ] now consider that the sample is interrogated with three consecutive ( in time ) ultra short laser pulses .",
    "treating @xmath37 as a perturbation the third order density matrix is given as @xmath40 here @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "experimentally we do not measure @xmath43 but the induced polarization @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath47 can be shifted to the time dependence of the density matrix using time evolution operators ( resulting @xmath47 as time independent ) . ultimately one have to take the trace over the bath modes thus one will end up having an expression involving time depended reduced density matrix elements of the system .",
    "this non - linear polarization will emit a signal electric field in the phase matching direction .",
    "it can be shown [ ] ( if the electric field amplitude varies slowly over the pigment size and if the refractive index of the material is frequency independent ) that @xmath53 now under the impulsive limit ( excitation femtosecond laser pulses as delta functions ) @xmath54 the signal electric field becomes proportional to the response function .",
