    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are a class of extragalactic , point - like sources with luminosity from @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 up to @xmath3 erg s@xmath2 , in excess of the eddington limit for a 10@xmath4 black hole ( bh ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such a high x - ray luminosity suggests that they host either intermediate mass bhs accreting at sub - eddington rate @xcite , or super - eddington accreting bhs of stellar mass or of stellar origin ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the most luminous ulxs ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath2 ) are usually considered as the best intermediate mass bh candidates ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , while less luminous sources could be super - eddington accreting bhs with masses in the range 580 m@xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the recent discovery of three pulsating neutron stars ( nss ) in the ulx m82 x-2 @xcite , ngc 7793 p13 and ngc 5907 x-1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) proved that ulxs can be powered by objects different from bhs .",
    "the ulxs spectra are generally described in terms of a cold ( kt @xmath6 kev ) soft thermal component coupled to a high - energy component with a cut - off below 10 kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . however , the quality of ulx spectra is generally low and the interpretation of their spectral properties is still matter of debate .    by exploiting the recent availability of broadband x - ray data obtained with the  and  satellites",

    "motivated by the discovery of x - ray pulsations from m82 x-2 and subsequently from ngc 7793 p13 and ngc 5907 x-1 , we adopted a simple spectral model that was extensively used to fit the x - ray continuum of accreting magnetic nss , especially x - ray pulsators in galactic high mass x - ray binaries ( for more details see * ? ? ?",

    "the model consists of a power - law with a high - energy exponential cut - off plus a blackbody ; we find that in most cases the ulx spectra are well fit by such a model , indicating that different interpretations of the ulx spectra are possible .",

    "the sources have available  and , in some cases , simultaneous ( or nearly simultaneous )  observations of good quality which allow us to put robust constraints on the high energy curvature of their x - ray spectrum ( i.e. with at least 10000 counts in the _ xmm - newton _ epic instruments , as shown in @xcite ) .",

    "ngc 5907 x-1 was observed six times with  ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and good quality spectra are available for the observations of february 2003 , february 2012 , november 2013 and july 2014 .",
    "simultaneous and quasi - simultaneous   data are available for the 2013 and 2014 observations .",
    "the fit of the 2003 , 2012 and 2014 spectra give results consistent within the errors with absence of spectral variability , as also found by @xcite .",

    "the 2013 spectrum , obtained when the source was about a factor of 2 - 3 fainter than in 2014 , is slightly softer ( @xmath211.9 ) , but it can still be fit by a cut - off power - law without the addition of a soft component .    for ngc 7793 p13 , we use two observations taken in 2013 and 2014 ( no   data are available ) .",

    "* ) . to illustrate the range of possible states in which the sources can be found , we plot in fig",

    "these are the observations reported in table  [ log ] , with corresponding best fit parameters listed in table  [ spectr ] .",
    "generally , the `` pulsator - like '' model gives good fits , except for a few cases in which the soft thermal component is not strictly required ( i.e. ic 342 x-1 in august 2012 , and ngc 1313 x-2 in december 2012 ) . in all other cases , blackbody components with temperatures in the range @xmath180.150.3 kev are required .",
    "a variety of power - law spectral slopes and cut - off parameters is found ( table  [ spectr ] ) .",
    "the relatively large @xmath11 values obtained in the fit of ho ix x-1 are caused by some excess emission at high energy , possibly indicating the presence of a further hard tail component , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we note that hard tails are observed also in the spectra of some galactic accreting nss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     finally , the spectra of ngc 55 ulx1 , ngc 5408 x-1 , and ngc 6946 show some residuals around 1 kev , as already reported in literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these features have been associated lately to a blending of unresolved emission and absorption lines produced by the photosphere of a possible outflowing wind in a scenario of super - eddington accretion on a stellar mass compact object @xcite .",
    "for the three sources , we find that good fits are obtained with the addition of one or two broad gaussian absorption lines centered at @xmath180.7 kev and @xmath181.2 kev and with widths @xmath22 kev .",
    "we found that the `` pulsator - like '' model can describe well the spectra of virtually all the ulxs of our sample .",
    "different broad band spectral shapes and best fit parameters characterize different sources ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_spectra ] and table  [ spectr ] ) .",
    "this is particularly evident at low energy , where , besides the effect of different absorption column densities ( from @xmath23 @xmath24 to @xmath25 @xmath24 ) , the relative importance of the soft component can differ significantly ( even if similar temperatures around kt@xmath180.2 kev are found ) .",
    "spectral differences are apparent also at higher energies , where the spectrum is dominated by the cut - off power - law component . in order to study in greater detail differences in the harder spectral component ( where the effects due to absorption and the additional soft component are negligible ) , search for correlations with other source properties , and",
    "possibly gather information on the innermost regions of the accretion flow close to the compact object , we characterize the high - energy spectra through a color - color diagram .",
    "this was done by using the fluxes in the 24 kev , 46 kev and 630 kev energy bands derived from the best - fit of table  [ spectr ] .",
    "we present the color - color diagram in figure  [ col - col ] , where we defined the _ hardness _ as the ( 630 kev)/(46 kev ) ratio and the _ softness _ as ( 24 kev)/(46 kev ) ratio .",
    "we note that the fluxes above 10 kev are estimated directly from the spectra only in the cases where _ nustar _ observations are available . in the other cases ,",
    "the fluxes are calculated from an extrapolation of the 0.310 kev best - fit model . as expected , sources displaying spectral variations move across different regions in this diagram ( note again that we pre - selected the most different spectra of each source ) several of the sources with parameters around _ hardness_@xmath181.5 and _ softness_@xmath181.5 become either softer ( i.e. move toward the upper - left corner of the figure ) or harder ( i.e. move toward the lower - right corner ) , but none of them shows both behaviors .",
    "this leads to a distinction between two different classes of softer and harder ulxs .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in e.g. @xcite and @xcite based on a different spectral analysis .",
    "we highlight that the two known ulx pulsars in the sample lie in the region of the color - color diagram that corresponds to the hardest spectra .",
    "their _ hardness _ values are close to the maximum but still within the broad distribution of the ulxs in our sample .",
    "we applied a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks ) to the distribution of the _ softness _ of pulsating and non - pulsating ulxs finding a ks - statistics of @xmath26 and a _",
    "p_-value of @xmath27 that they are drawn from the same sample .",
    "although with the current limited sample it is difficult to obtain firm conclusions , it is interesting to note that also the ulx pulsar m82 x-2 has a rather hard spectrum @xcite .",
    "we note that ngc 7793 p13 attained the lowest values of the _ softness _ ratio of the whole sample . during the epoch",
    "1 observation , when no pulsations were found in the timing data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a ) , the spectrum of ngc 5907 x-1 was close to the center of the distribution in fig .",
    "[ col - col ] . in 2014 ,",
    "when pulsations were detected , the position of ngc 5907 x-1 in the color - color diagram was closer to that of ngc 7793 p13 .",
    "hence , when pulsations were seen , the two ulx pulsars were significantly hard .",
    "the only sources that , at least on one epoch , had spectral parameters similar to those of the ulx pulsars are ic 342 x-1 and ho ix x-1 .",
    "in previous studies , ulx spectra characterized by a curvature above 35 kev and a soft excess below @xmath181 kev were described in terms of physically - motivated spectral models for accreting bhs of different masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "inspired by the recent discovery of pulsations in three ulxs @xcite , we applied here a model that has been commonly used to fit the x - ray continuum of accreting magnetic nss ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) to good quality  and  spectra of a sample of bright ulxs .",
    "such model , highecut@xmath15powerlaw plus a soft blackbody , was introduced empirically ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and later found to be similar to the spectra calculated from models of bulk and thermal comptonization in magnetic accretion models @xcite which have also been employed to fit the spectra of a few x - ray pulsars in hmxbs @xcite .",
    "the shape of its exponential cutoff is regulated by two parameters ( the e - folding energy @xmath13 and the cutoff energy @xmath12 ) , through which the spectra with vastly different curvature observed in accreting x - ray pulsars at high energies ( usually @xmath28  kev ) can be fitted . in this work we found that this `` pulsator - like '' continuum model , together with a soft component , can be successfully used to describe also the overall shape of the spectra of bright ulxs .",
    "this suggests also that accreting bh - based models usually adopted for ulxs ( e.g. disc blackbody plus comptonization ) do not necessarily have the interpretative power that has been attributed to them .",
    "in our spectral fits , the soft blackbody component has a temperature of @xmath180.1 - 0.3 kev in all sources , but its relative importance differs across different spectra and sources .",
    "the equivalent radius of the thermally emitting region , inferred from the normalization of the blackbody component , is typically larger than 100 km .",
    "this value rules out any association with the putative ns surface , but may be consistent with the size of the emitting region of the disc close to the co - rotation radius , as in the case of some x - ray pulsators and ulx pulsars @xcite .",
    "alternatively , since pulsating ulxs have super - eddington accretion rates , the soft component may originate in a powerful outflow that is ejected from the accretion disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the best fit values derived with the highecut @xmath15powerlaw for the hard component span a fairly large range , both in spectral slope and cut - off and folding energies , as observed also in galactic accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "this component is believed to arise in the post - shock region of the accretion column above the surface of the neutron star .",
    "recent analytical calculations , as well as 2d radiation - hydro - simulations of accretion onto magnetized nss , show that for magnetic fields of @xmath29  g or larger , very high luminosities ( up to 2 - 3 orders of magnitude above the eddington limit ) can be produced @xcite .",
    "based on currently available data , it is not possible to assess whether bh - models or the pulsator - like model we adopted provide a statistically better fit to the x - ray continuum of bright ulxs .",
    "the two types of models resemble each other in that they both comprise a soft component ( a blackbody or a disk - blackbody , which is very difficult to distinguish at the soft x - ray energies where it is seen ) and a harder component comprising a powerlaw - like spectrum with exponential cutoff , which likely originates from comptonization in an accretion disk corona in the case of bhs and from the post - shock region of a magnetically - funneled accretion column in the case of nss .",
    "the shape of the cut - off can be smoother or steeper than a simple exponential in the pulsator - like model . in order to ascertain what observations would be required to distinguish between bh and ns - like spectral models we simulated the spectra of ic 342 x-1 and ngc 1313 x-1 by using the best - fit diskbb+comptt model ( see e.g. @xcite ) and a 1  ms exposure time with _ xmm - newton _ and _",
    "nustar_. by fitting these spectra with a highecut@xmath15powerlaw model , we found structured spectral residuals at high energy ( @xmath30 kev ) , not observed with a diskbb+comptt model .",
    "the same simulation was carried out based on the specifications of the future x - ray mission _",
    "athena+ _ where a discrimination of the two models required an exposure time of at least @xmath31 ks in the wfi instrument .",
    "however , we highlight that the simple diskbb+comptt model , when using _ nustar _ data , has been challenged in the sources ho ix x-1 @xcite , already indicating that ulx spectra do not completely suit with a bh description only .",
    "the relatively large number of parameters in the bb + highecut@xmath15powerlaw model hampers a straightforward comparison between the sources , but a clear picture emerges from a color - color diagram in which only the range above 2 kev is considered , where absorption effects are negligible and there is no ( or marginal ) contamination from the soft component .",
    "this clearly shows that the ulx pulsars , when pulsations are detected , have a harder spectrum than that of the majority of the other ulxs of the sample ( note that the spectrum of ngc 5907 x-1 was somewhat softer in 2013 , when no pulsations from this source were detected ) .",
    "there are no instrumental effects that favor the detection of pulsations , if present , in harder sources , but we can not exclude that for some processes intrinsic to the sources the flux modulation increases when their spectra become harder .",
    "it is possible to speculate that the harder sources are those observed more directly in the inner regions close to the compact objects ( or possibly from an accretion column , @xcite ) and this might facilitate the detection of pulsations in the case of accreting ns ; while for softer sources the inner regions might be possibly occluded ( because of higher angles of the line of sight ) by cold , optically thick plasmas which reduce the pulsation coherence .",
    "none of the other sources showed high - energy spectra as hard as the hardest spectra of the ulx pulsars , except for ic 342 x-1 and ho ix x-1 .",
    "the spectral parameters of these two sources overlap , at least on one epoch , with those of the ulx pulsars ( see fig .",
    "[ col - col ] ) .",
    "hence we suggest that ic 342 x-1 and ho ix x-1 may be good candidates ns ulxs . on the basis of their spectrum alone ,",
    "ngc 5408 x-1 , ho ii x-1 , ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2 , ngc 5643 ulx1 and ngc 6946 x-1 are instead less likely to contain nss .",
    "the failure to detect pulsations so far in ic 342 x-1 and ho ix x-1 may be caused by intermittent activity of periodic flux modulation and/or by the presence of a large period derivative .",
    "however it should be also noted that x - ray luminosity swing of the ulx pulsars is much larger ( @xmath32 a factor of 100 ) than that of ic 342 x-1 and ho",
    "ix x-1 ( a factor of @xmath33 only ) . following israel et al .",
    "( 2016a , b ) and assuming that the sources are all viewed at comparable inclination angles and have comparable beaming , we expect that the higher the luminosity the higher the magnetic field .",
    "israel et al .",
    "( 2016a , b ) estimated a dipolar magnetic field of @xmath34 g for ngc 5907 x-1 and @xmath35 g for ngc 7793 p13 .",
    "since ic 342 x-1 and ho ix x-1 have luminosities of @xmath36 erg s@xmath2 , we can roughly guess a dipolar magnetic field of @xmath18@xmath37 g for both sources if their spin period will turn out to be in the range of seconds as well .",
    "we adopted a commonly used spectral model for accreting x - ray pulsating ns in the galaxy to describe the spectra of a sample of bright ulxs .",
    "we found that this model well describes the spectra of most ulxs , suggesting that spectral models based on accreting bhs may not have the interpretative power that has been ascribed to them up to now .",
    "we conclude that other ulxs may be found to host nss accreting at super - eddington rates .",
    "we showed also that the known pulsating ulxs are amongst the hardest sources of our sample , with ic 342 x-1 and ho ix x-1 having comparably hard spectra . based on their spectral properties alone ,",
    "we thus suggest these two sources are likely candidate ns ulxs .",
