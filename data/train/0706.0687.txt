    "pattern formation is an ubiquitous phenomenon in out - of - equilibrium systems , and ordered structures often emerge in the wake of a moving reaction front  @xcite",
    ". there has been recently increasing interest , both experimental and theoretical , in the study of various types of chemically - generated patterns .",
    "the main reason is that they are expected to provide new _ bottom - up _ , self - assembling technologies for engineering bulk patterns on mesoscopic and microscopic scales ( for illustration see e.g.  @xcite from a rapidly - growing bibliography ) , for which the traditional _ top - down _ methods ( i.e. , removing material in order to create a structure ) are reaching the limits of their capabilities .",
    "detailed understanding of the mechanisms responsible for pattern formation is a key - element in developing technological applications since it helps constructing the appropriate tools for the control of the characteristics of the emerging patterns . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on designing a simple method to control the so - called _ liesegang structures _  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this method should be useful for a recently - proposed experimental set - up that allows to create _",
    "stamps _ of such structures  @xcite .    depending on the geometry ,",
    "liesegang precipitation patterns are bands ( in an axially - symmetric configuration ) , rings or shells ( in a circular , respectively spherical - symmetric configuration ) , clearly separated in the direction of motion of a chemical reaction front .",
    "several generic experimental laws characterize the patterns , see e.g.  @xcite for reviews .",
    "in particular , it is found that the positions of the bands usually obey simple laws ; e.g. they form , with a good approximation , a geometric series with increasing distance between consecutive bands .",
    "this is the so - called _ regular banding _ situation , which has been recently explained  @xcite using the _ phase separation in the presence of a moving front _ as the underlying mechanism .",
    "briefly , the reaction front , which moves diffusively , leaves behind a constant concentration @xmath1 of the _ reaction product _ , that we shall conventionally name hereafter _ @xmath2 particles _  @xcite . at a coarse - grained level",
    ", the dynamics of the @xmath2 particles ( that can diffuse , and are also attracting each other ) can be described by a cahn - hilliard equation  @xcite with a source term corresponding to the moving reaction front . starting with a system free of @xmath2 s , the dynamics of the front brings locally the system across the spinodal line , provided that @xmath1 is inside the unstable region of the phase diagram .",
    "a phase separation takes then place on a short time scale and a band of precipitate is rapidly formed just behind the front .",
    "this band acts as a sink for the @xmath2 particles .",
    "then the local concentration of @xmath2 s decreases , bringing the system locally in the stable phase again .",
    "thus liesegang patterns are formed since the state of the system at the front is locally and quasi - periodically driven into the unstable regime .",
    "the characteristics of these _ regular patterns _ can be controlled to some extent through an appropriate choice of the concentration of the reagents  @xcite , of the nature of the gel that is filling the reaction container  @xcite , the shape of the container  @xcite , or through an applied electric field  @xcite .",
    "the spinodal decomposition scenario has proved its power by describing _",
    "regular _ patterns and , furthermore , by explaining how those patterns can be influenced by the concentration of the outer and inner electrolytes and by an external electric field .",
    "we will show that it can be extended to describe other situations , as well . indeed , there is experimental evidence of liesegang - type precipitation patterns with decreasing distances between successive bands  @xcite which is termed _",
    "inverse banding_. in the _ borderline _ case between regular and inverse banding , the distances between successive bands are constant , a situation called _ equidistant banding _  @xcite . in our attempts of describing the above patterns we were lead to a mechanism which may provide a simple , experimentally realizable _ control tool _ of the emerging pattern .    as described in detail in sec .",
    "[ model ] , our proposal is based on a phase separation mechanism in a _",
    "space- and time - dependent guiding field _ , which could represent , for example , a temperature or a _ ph _ field .",
    "the pattern formation is thus modeled through a _",
    "non - autonomous ch equation _",
    ", whose spinodal line is controlled by the guiding field .",
    "note that the present design of the guiding field is different from the _ homogeneous ( overall ) cooling _ that was used in most of the previous studies of non - autonomous ch models , see e.g.  @xcite . as we shall demonstrate , a simple guiding field is sufficient to generate crossover between regular and inverse patterns .",
    "for example , such a guiding field can be a temperature field evolving diffusively due to a temperature difference at the boundaries of the system , whose characteristics are detailed in sec .  [ gfc ] .",
    "the features of the corresponding emerging patterns are analyzed in sec .",
    "[ results ] . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ interpretation ] , our numerical findings can be justified by theoretical arguments relating the velocity of the front of the guiding field to the pulled - front velocity resulting from a linear stability analysis of the phase - separation process .",
    "other , more flexible ways to control the patterns are also briefly presented in sec .",

    "finally , conclusions and perspectives are discussed in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "let us consider a tube filled with gel , and an initially uniform concentration @xmath1 of @xmath2 particles throughout the tube .",
    "assuming axial symmetry along the @xmath3-axis of the tube , we shall consider that the @xmath2-particle concentration @xmath4 evolves in time according to the cahn - hilliard ( ch ) equation in one dimension .",
    "after rescaling the space and time variables , this equation can be written in the following dimensionless form @xmath5\\ , ,   \\label{ch1}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the dimensionless length of the tube .",
    "note that we also performed an appropriate _ shift and scaling of the concentration _ that allows us to write the ch equation in a form that is more convenient for the exposition of our problem ; namely , this form is symmetric with respect to the change in sign of @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( see e.g.  @xcite and footnote  @xcite for a more detailed discussion of this point ) .",
    "the shifted and rescaled concentration can take both positive and negative values , and the stable configurations are symmetric around @xmath10 .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 measures the deviation of the temperature from the critical temperature @xmath12 ; it is negative for temperatures above @xmath12 ( for which no phase - separation is possible ) , while it is positive for temperatures @xmath13 . below the critical temperature , a uniform concentration profile @xmath1 inside the spinodal decomposition domain ,",
    "i.e. @xmath14 , is linearly unstable . a small , localized perturbation of the concentration",
    "can then trigger a phase separation throughout the system , through the amplification of the unstable modes of wavenumbers @xmath15 .",
    "a large body of work ( see e.g.  @xcite ) has been devoted to the study of the phase separation process in the simple case of a uniform parameter @xmath11 taking the same value throughout the system .    here",
    "we shall concentrate on a different situation , namely when @xmath11 is a _ field _ , which evolves according to its own dynamics .",
    "moreover , it is possible to control its evolution . for a simple realization of this control consider the following situation .",
    "suppose that at a time @xmath16 the temperature at one end of the tube is lowered and kept at a constant value @xmath17 thereafter .",
    "the other end of the tube is supposed to be thermally isolated  @xcite .",
    "the temperature profile then evolves in time along the tube according to the usual fourier law of heat conduction , and so does the related @xmath18 field , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dimensionless thermal diffusion coefficient . through an appropriate scaling of the temperature ,",
    "the value of @xmath11 can be set to @xmath21 throughout the system at @xmath16 , while @xmath22 at @xmath23 at the left ( @xmath24 ) end of the tube ; at the right ( @xmath25 ) end of the tube there is no heat flow : @xmath26 these equations  ( [ ch2 ] ) , ( [ bic2 ] ) define completely the evolution of @xmath18 along the tube , from the onset of the cooling procedure till reaching the asymptotic uniform profile @xmath22 throughout the tube  @xcite .    for the value @xmath27 , the uniform concentration profile @xmath1 is stable , while for @xmath22 it tends to phase - separate ( i.e. , the initial concentration @xmath28 ) .",
    "therefore , with the advancing cooling front , the @xmath2-particle concentration becomes _ locally _ unstable with respect to phase separation . as a consequence ,",
    "a pattern made of alternating low- and high - density phases of @xmath2 appears simultaneously to the propagation of the cooling front along the tube .",
    "its properties and characteristics result thus from the ch equation  ( [ ch1 ] ) _ coupled _ to the evolution equation  ( [ ch2 ] ) for @xmath18 .",
    "appropriate boundary conditions ( i ) guarantee the conservation of @xmath2 particles inside the tube ( more precisely , zero - particle fluxes @xmath29 at the edges ) , and ( ii ) associated to the initial condition , they also ensure the uniqueness of the solution .",
    "the boundary conditions we used in our numerical discretized procedure amount , in the continuum limit , to @xmath30 with @xmath31 . setting @xmath32 means that @xmath8 at the boundaries relaxes to @xmath33 determined by the boundary value of @xmath11 .",
    "more detailed considerations , including other types of boundary conditions and appropriate discretization schemes , are discussed e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite .    the field @xmath18 related to the diffusive temperature profile is thus playing the role of a _ guiding field_. one can think of , however , other types of fields @xmath18 , other boundary and initial conditions for an experimental setup . as an example",
    ", one can assume that a chemical agent is diffusing from one reservoir at the @xmath24 end of the tube , its concentration changes the local _ ph _ of the system , and thus may drive the @xmath2 particles to phase separation , etc .",

    "finally , the fact that the numerical wavelengths are systematically larger that the theoretically - estimated ones may be the combined effect of slow relaxation to the asymptotic state and the quasi - stationary nature of our configuration during the onset of the pattern ( see the comments above on the effects of transients on the wavelength , in the autonomous case ) .",
    "we address now the problem of _ controllability _ of the characteristics of the emerging pattern .",
    "it is obvious from the above results that both the qualitative ( i.e. , regular or inverse banding ) and quantitative features ( like total length of the pattern , pattern local wavelength , width of bands , etc . )",
    "can be controlled in the described configuration through an appropriate choice of the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath1 , and ( to a less extent , as more difficult to manipulate ) @xmath20 . moreover",
    ", these results can be described theoretically in the frame of the _ pulled - front _ approximation thus providing a method for estimating the parameters of the patterns . however ,",
    "this method of control , although very simple , is somewhat rigid , since the above - mentioned control parameters can not be changed during the process , while , ideally , one requires an easily tuned , flexible , external tool of control . one can then think about moving the tube with the gel ( or maybe a thin film of gel ) in a prescribed temperature profile , with a velocity that can be changed at any moment according to the needs .",
    "one achieves therefore a guiding field @xmath18 that can be externally tuned at any moment and point .",
    "for example , the simplest configuration one can imagine is an abrupt , _ step - like _ temperature profile that moves with velocity @xmath46 , such that @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) , where @xmath115 designates the heaviside step function and @xmath38 is the instantaneous position of the step . if the motion is uniform @xmath116 , then one obtains _",
    "equidistant banding_. if the motion of the step is accelerated or decelerated , then the pattern presents _ inverse - banding _ , respectively _",
    "regular banding _",
    ", with characteristics that depend on the details of @xmath117 .",
    "another simple option is to propagate a smooth , given temperature profile along the tube , such that @xmath118 .",
    "now , the characteristics of the emerging pattern do not depend only on the velocity @xmath119 of the propagating _ rigid _ guiding field profile , but also on the shape of this profile .    in order to illustrate these points , we considered , for comparison , the emerging pattern in three situations ( also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure0 ] ) , namely for : + ( i ) the diffusive guiding - field profile , as discussed in the previous sections , for a given set of parameters @xmath20 , @xmath7 , and @xmath1 .",
    "recall that the instability front moves with a velocity @xmath119 described in sec .",
    "[ gfc ] ; + ( ii ) a step - like profile of the guiding field that moves with the same velocity @xmath119 ; + ( iii ) finally , a parabolic profile of guiding field , @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "one has @xmath27 for @xmath121 and the parameter @xmath122 is determined such that for @xmath123 one has @xmath124 .",
    "as before , this rigid profile moves with the same velocity @xmath119 .",
    "+ the results of the numerical simulation are represented in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] , together with the theoretical result based on our ansatz .",
    "one can notice that : + ( i ) the pattern can be effectively controlled by the proposed methods .",
    "the effects are qualitatively the same as for our usual configuration , but these new methods allow for more flexible control . + ( ii ) the pattern obtained for the parabolic - like profile ( with @xmath125 ) is closer to the pattern obtained for our usual configuration , as well as to the theoretical predictions based on the pulled - front approximation ; the pattern obtained for the step - like profile is much different .",
    "this convincingly illustrates the importance of the quasi - stationarity hypothesis for the pulled - front theory .",
    "indeed , this basic ingredient is a good approximation both for our usual configuration and for the parabolic profile , but it is definitely absent in the case of the step - like profile , for which the associated abrupt jump in the local value of @xmath11 forbids any possibility of quasi - stationarity .     versus band positions @xmath74 , in appropriate rescaled variables .",

    "we have discussed the problem of how to control precipitation patterns by bringing a system described by the cahn - hilliard equation into an unstable state using a prescribed guiding field .",
    "it was shown that simple , physically realizable fields , such as a temperature field generated by a temperature jump at the boundary , is sufficient to generate rather complex precipitation patterns even in one dimension .",
    "the spacing characteristics of the patterns were determined numerically for the case of a diffusive guiding field , and we developed a quantitative theory for explaining the simulation results . the theory is based on relating the velocity of the instability front generated by the guiding field to the natural , pulled - front velocity of the phase - separation process which , in turn , controls the lengthscale of the pattern left in the wake of the moving front .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", our results suggest that the inverse - banding phenomena observed in some liesegang experiments may have an explanation in terms of a diffusive guiding field .",
    "this guiding field is perhaps not a temperature field , but may be generated by the diffusion of some chemical species which do not take part in the reactions and the precipitation but may change e.g. the local _ ph _ value and thus influences the precipitation thresholds .",
    "as far as the technological applications are concerned , it appears that the problem of microfabrication of bulk structures by chemical reactions and precipitation  @xcite is just in the first stages of its development .",
    "the usefulness of this field will be decided on the possibility of creating flexible ways to ensure controllability .",
    "our results suggest experimentally feasible solutions for the control of a particular precipitation process ( formation of liesegang bands ) .",
