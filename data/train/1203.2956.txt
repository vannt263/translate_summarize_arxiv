    "optical interferometry represents a high accurate measurement scheme with wide applications in many fields of science and technology @xcite . besides , the precise estimation of an optical phase shift is relevant for optical communication schemes where information is encoded in the phase of travelling pulses .",
    "several experimental protocols have been proposed and demonstrated to estimate the value of the optical phase @xcite and showing the possibility to attain the so - called heisenberg limit @xcite .",
    "recent developments also revealed the potential advantages of nonlinear interactions @xcite .",
    "however , in realistic conditions , one has to retrieve phase information that has been unavoidably degraded by different sources of noise , which have to be taken into account in order to evaluate the interferometric precision @xcite .",
    "the effects of imperfect photodetection in the measurement stage , or the presence of amplitude noise in the interferometric arms have been extensively studied @xcite . only recently",
    ", the role of phase - diffusive noise in interferometry have been theoretically investigated for optical polarization qubit @xcite , condensate systems @xcite , bose - josephson junctions @xcite , and gaussian states of light @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", phase - diffusive noise is the most detrimental for interferometry and any signal that is unaffected by phase - diffusion , is also invariant under a phase shift , and thus totally useless for phase estimation .    in this paper",
    ", we present an experimental interferometric scheme where phase diffusion may be inserted in a controlled way , and demonstrate that homodyne detection and coherent signals are nearly optimal for the detection of a phase shift in the presence of large phase diffusion . indeed , while in ideal conditions squeezed vacuum is the most sensitive gaussian probe state for a given average photon number @xcite , for large phase - diffusive noise , coherent states become the optimal choice , outperforming squeezed states @xcite . in our scheme the ultimate bound to interferometric sensitivity , as dictated by the cramr - rao ( cr ) theorem , is achieved already for a small number of repeated measurements , of the order of hundreds , using bayesian inference on homodyne data and without the need of nonclassical light .    the paper is structured as follows : in section [ s : intn ] we describe the evolution of a light beam in a phase diffusing environment as well as the bound to interferometric precision in the presence of phase noise . in section [ s : expa ] we describe our experimental apparatus , whereas the experimental results are reported and discussed in section [ s : expr ] .",
    "section [ s : outro ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the evolution of a light beam in a phase diffusing environment is described by the master equation @xmath0 \\varrho\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath1\\varrho   = 2 o \\varrho o^\\dag - o^\\dag o \\varrho - \\varrho o^\\dag o$ ] and @xmath2 is the phase damping rate .",
    "an initial state @xmath3 evolves as @xmath4 where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the diagonal elements are left unchanged , in fact energy is conserved , whereas the off - diagonal ones are progressively destroyed , together with the phase information carried by the state .",
    "phase diffusion corresponds to the application of a random , zero - mean gaussian - distributed phase shift , i.e. , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the phase shift operator .",
    "we assume that the phase noise occurs between the application of the phase shift and the detection of the signal , and consider the estimation of a phase shift applied to a single - mode coherent state .",
    "homodyne detection is then performed on the output state @xmath9 is inferred using bayesian estimation applied to homodyne data .",
    "notice , however , that since the phase noise map and the phase shift operation commute , our results are valid also when the phase shift is applied to an already phase - diffused coherent state .",
    "the precision of the above procedure is then compared with the benchmarks given by i ) the quantum cr bound for coherent states and any quantum limited kind of measurement , ii ) the ultimate precision achievable with optimized gaussian states , i.e. , the quantum cr bound for general gaussian signals , where , e.g. , we allow for squeezing .      the quantum cr bound @xcite is obtained starting from the born rule @xmath10 $ ] where @xmath11 is the operator - valued measure describing the measurement and @xmath12 the density operator of the family of phase - shifted states under investigation . upon introducing the ( symmetric ) logarithmic derivative @xmath13 as the operator satisfying @xmath14 one proves that the ultimate limit to precision ( independently on the measurement used ) is given by the quantum cr bound @xmath15^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] is the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) .",
    "the ultimate sensitivity of an interferometer thus depends on the family of signals used to probe the phase shift and thus , as said above , we are going to compare the precision of our interferometer with the maximum achievable with coherent states , and with the ultimate precision achievable with optimized gaussian states ( for more details about the derivation of the corresponding quantum cr bounds see @xcite ) .",
    "homodyne detection measures the field quadrature @xmath17 where @xmath18 is set to the optimal value to detect the imposed phase shift .",
    "the likelihood of a set of homodyne data @xmath19 is the overall probability of the sample given the unknown phase @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 where @xmath22 assuming that no a priori information is available on the value of the phase shift ( i.e. , uniform prior ) , and using the bayes theorem , one can write the _ a posteriori _ probability @xmath23 @xmath24 $ ] being the parameter space .",
    "the probability @xmath25 is the expected distribution of @xmath20 _ given _ the data sample @xmath26 .",
    "the bayesian estimator @xmath27 is the mean of the a posteriori distribution , whereas the sensitivity of the overall procedure corresponds to its variance @xmath28 = \\int_{\\phi}d\\phi\\,(\\phi-\\phi_{\\rm b})^2\\,p(\\phi|x)\\,.\\ ] ] bayesian estimators are known to be asymptotically unbiased and optimal , namely , they allow one to achieve the cr bound as the size of the data sample increases @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of data needed to achieve the asymptotic region may depend on the specific implementation @xcite . in the following",
    "we will experimentally show that our setup achieves optimal estimation already after collecting few hundreds of measurements .",
    "a schematic diagram of the interferometer is reported in fig .",
    "[ exp_setup ] .",
    "the principal radiation source is provided by a he : ne laser ( 12  mw , 633  nm ) shot - noise limited above 2  mhz .",
    "the laser emits a linearly polarized beam in a tem00 mode .",
    "the beam is splitted into two parts of variable relative intensity by a combination of a halfwave plate ( hwp ) and a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the strongest part is sent directly to the homodyne detector where it acts as the local oscillator , whereas the ramaining part is used to encode the signal and will undergo the homodyne detection .",
    "the optical paths travelled by the local oscillator and the signal beams are carefully adjusted to obtain a visibility typically above 90% measured at one of the homodyne output ports .",
    "the signal is amplitude modulated at 4  mhz with a defined modulation depth to control the average number of photons in the generate state .    the amplitude modulation system consist of a kdp non - linear crystal with the @xmath29 axes at 45@xmath30 , and a pbs",
    ". the modulation is applied at the kdp crystal by means a waveform generator rohde & schwarz and a power amplifier mini - circuits zhl-32a .",
    "the modulation depth is imposed at the proper level by a computer that sends a costant voltage to a mixer ( m1 ) located between the waveform generator and the power amplifier .",
    "one of the mirrors in the signal path is piezo mounted to obtain a variable phase difference between the two beams .",
    "the piezo is preloaded and its resonance frequency is 13.5  khz .",
    "the phase difference is controlled by the computer after a calibration stage .",

    "one of the mirrors in the signal path is piezo mounted to obtain a variable phase difference between the two beams .",
    "the data are recorded by a homodyne detector whose difference photocorrent is demodulated and then acquired by a computer after a low pass filter .",
    "we also show the typical homodyne samples obtained for coherent signals of different amplitudes by varying the phase of the local oscillator ( these are used to check the calibration of the piezo , which is performed using signals with a larger number of photons ) . ]",
    "the detector is composed by a 50:50 beams splitter ( bs ) and a balanced amplifier detector with a bandwidth of 50  mhz .",
    "the difference photocurrent is filtered with high pass filters , amplified and demodulated at 4  mhz by means of an electrical mixer ( m2 ) . in this way",
    "the detection occurs outside any technical noise and , more importantly , in a spectral region where the laser does not carry excess noise .",
    "the signal is filterd by a low pass filter with a bandwidth of 300  khz and sent to the computer through the national instrument multichannel data acquisition 6251 with 16  bit of resolution and 1.25  ms / s sampling rate .",
    "the same device is used to send diffusion parameters to the phase modulator and signal parameters to the amplitude modulator .",
    "in this section , we present our experimental results , obtained with signals of different energies and different levels of noise . at first",
    "we show homodyne samples with the corresponding _ a posteriori _ distributions and then compare the precision obtained in our scheme with the ultimate bound imposed by the ( quantum ) cramr - rao theorem .",
    "finally , we analyze the dependence of precision on the signal energy and the noise in order to illustrate how in the limit of large phase diffusion coherent states becomes the optimal gaussian probe states .",

    "notice that using optimized gaussian signals , i.e. the squeezed vacuum state , one has a qfi given by @xmath40 in the noiseless case .",
