    "often one needs to compute the free energy and/or entropy of a graphical model . the bethe approximation and",
    "the related belief propagation ( bp ) equations may sometimes offer a good starting point .",
    "however it is seldom a controlled approximation and even worse it is usually not clear if it yields upper or lower bounds , or even if there is any such relationship .",
    "there are not many results that precisely pinpoint the relation between the bethe and true free energies or entropies .",
    "a general result of vontobel @xcite relates the bethe free energy to an average of the true free energy over all graph covers . for ising - like graphical models with attractive pair interactions ,",
    "wainwright @xcite has shown that , under additional special conditions , the bethe free energy is a bound to the true free energy .",
    "this work uses the same loop series used here .",
    "it is well known that the bethe free energy is exact on trees , and it is natural to investigate its possible exactness on random erdoes - rnyi type graphs which are known to be locally tree - like .",
    "but we already know of systems , such as random constraint satisfaction models ( e.g , @xmath0-sat or @xmath1-coloring ) or spin glasses , where the true free energy _ is not _ given by the bethe formula - even when averaged over the graph ensemble .",
    "the local tree - like nature of the graph is not sufficient when long ranged correlations are present @xcite . for graphical models that describe communication with low density ( parity - check and generator - matrix ) codes over binary - symmetric memoryless channels",
    "the situation is favorable .",
    "indeed we have plenty of evidence that the replica - symmetric solution is exact .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for bounds and @xcite , @xcite for results on the binary erasure channel .",
    "in @xcite it is proven that correlations between pairs of distant ( with respect to tanner graph distance ) bits decay exponentially fast for ldgm codes in the regime of large noise , and ldpc codes in the regime of small noise .",
    "this also allowed to conclude that the replica symmetric formulas are exact in these regimes .",
    "a few years ago chertkov and chernyak @xcite developed a loop series representation for the free energy of graphical models .",
    "the virtue of this representation is that it isolates the bethe contribution , and represents the _ remainder _ by a series of terms involving only bp messages associated to",
    "_ generalized loops _ of the graph .",
    "it is tempting to use this representation as a tool to compare the true and bethe free energies .    in this contribution",
    "we consider regular ldpc@xmath2 codes used over a _",
    "highly noisy _ bsc .",
    "consider the conditional entropy @xmath3 of the input word @xmath4 given a channel output @xmath5 .",
    "we prove that in the large size limit , with high probability with respect to the code ensemble , the difference between the conditional entropy and the bethe formula tends to zero .",
    "the error term essentially comes from the probability that the graph is not locally tree - like .",
    "our techniques also allow to organize the dominant correction terms into a _ polymer expansion _ involving generalized loops of size less than @xmath6 ( @xmath7 a constant ) .",
    "as we will show , expander arguments imply that this polymer expansion converges uniformly in @xmath8 .",
    "when the terms of the polymer expansion are added to the bethe expression , with high probability , the difference with the conditional entropy becomes @xmath9 for some @xmath10 .",
    "our results also apply to more general models .",
    "namely the channel could have asymmetric flip probability .",
    "in fact the whole technique and results apply to spin - glass models on @xmath2 tanner graphs with @xmath11 odd and @xmath12 , with _ small magnetic fields _ , and _ any temperature_.the limitation to @xmath12 is not just technical .",
    "indeed @xmath13 would correspond to a kind of xorsat constraint satisfaction problem , and for the usual xorsat problem we know that the replica symmetric solutions are not generally exact at low temperatures .",
    "the case @xmath14 ( cycle codes ) has its own special features and has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we begin with a few definitions and notations .",
    "fix two integers @xmath12 . consider two vertex sets : @xmath15 a set of @xmath8 _ variable nodes _ and @xmath16 a set of @xmath17 _ check nodes_. we think of @xmath8 large and @xmath18 fixed .",

    "the corresponding expectation is @xmath25 .",
