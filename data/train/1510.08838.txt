    "one of the first striking applications of gromov s theory of pseudoholomorphic curves @xcite was that a closed exact lagrangian immersion @xmath4 inside a liouville manifold must have a double - point , given the assumption that it is hamiltonian displaceable .",
    "gromov s result has the following contact - geometric reformulation , which will turn out to be useful .",
    "consider the so - called _ contactisation _ @xmath5 of the liouville manifold @xmath6 , which is a contact manifold with the choice of a contact form . recall that a ( generic ) exact lagrangian immersion @xmath4 lifts to a legendrian ( embedding ) @xmath7 .",
    "one says that @xmath1 is _ horizontally displaceable _ given that @xmath8 is hamiltonian displaceable .",
    "the above result thus translates into the fact that a horizontally displaceable legendrian submanifold @xmath1 must have a _",
    "reeb chord _ for the above standard contact form ",
    "i.e.  a non - trivial integral curve of @xmath9 having endpoints on @xmath1 .",
    "a similar result holds for legendrian submanifolds of boundaries of subcritical weinstein manifolds , as proven in @xcite by mohnke .    in the spirit of arnold @xcite ,",
    "the following conjectural refinement of the above result was later made : the number of reeb chords on a chord - generic legendrian submanifold @xmath7 whose lagrangian projection is hamiltonian displaceable is at least @xmath10 .",
    "however , as was shown by sauvaget in @xcite by the explicit counter - examples inside the standard contact vector space @xmath11 , @xmath12 , the above inequality is not true without additional assumptions on the the legendrian submanifold ; also , see the more recent examples constructed in @xcite by ekholm - eliashberg - murphy - smith .",
    "the latter result is based upon the h - principle proven in @xcite by eliashberg - murphy for lagrangian cobordisms having loose negative ends in the sense of murphy @xcite .    on the positive side ,",
    "the above arnold - type bound has been proven using the legendrian contact homology of the legendrian submanifold , under the additional assumption that the legendrian contact homology algebra is sufficiently well - behaved .",
    "legendrian contact homology is a legendrian isotopy invariant independently constructed by chekanov @xcite and eliashberg - givental - hofer @xcite , and later developed by ekholm - etnyre - sullivan @xcite .",
    "this invariant is defined by encoding pseudoholomorphic disc counts in the legendrian contact homology differential graded algebra ( dga for short ) which usually is called the _ chekanov - eliashberg algebra _ of the legendrian submanifold . in the case",
    "when the chekanov - eliashberg algebra of a legendrian admits an augmentation ( this should be seen as a form of non - obstructedness for its floer theory ) , the above arnold - type bound was proven by ekholm - etnyre - sullivan in @xcite and by ekholm - etnyre - sabloff in @xcite . in @xcite , the authors generalised this proof to the case when the chekanov - eliashberg algebra admits a finite - dimensional matrix representation , in which case the same lower bound also is satisfied .",
    "the above arnold - type bound is also related to the one regarding the number of hamiltonian chords between the zero - section in @xmath13 ( or , more generally , any exact closed lagrangian submanifold of a liouville manifold ) and its image under a generic hamiltonian diffeomorphism .",
    "namely , such hamiltonian chords correspond to reeb chords on a legendrian lift of the union of the lagrangian submanifold and its image under the hamiltonian diffeomorphism .",
    "in fact , as shown by laudenbach - sikorav in @xcite , the number of such chords is bounded from below by the stable morse number of the zero - section ( and hence , in particular , it is bounded from below by half of the betti numbers of the disjoint union of _ two _ copies of the zero - section ) .",
    "arnold originally asked whether this bound can be improved , and if in fact the _ morse number _ of the zero - section is a lower bound .",
    "however , this question seems to be out of reach of current technology . on the other hand",
    ", we note that the stable morse number is equal to the morse number in a number of cases ; see @xcite as well as section [ sec : gendefs ] below for more details .",
    "finally , we mention the remarkable result by ekholm - smith in @xcite , which shows that the smooth structure itself can predict the existence of more double points than the original bound given in terms of the homology .",
    "namely , a @xmath14-dimensional manifold @xmath15 for @xmath16 that admits a legendrian embedding having precisely one transverse reeb chord in the standard contact space must be _ diffeomorphic _ to the standard sphere unless @xmath17 .",
    "also see @xcite for similar results in other dimensions .      in this paper",
    ", we will explore a priori lower bounds for the number of reeb chords on a legendrian submanifold @xmath7 , given that it admits an exact lagrangian filling @xmath18 inside the symplectisation . recall that the condition of admitting an exact lagrangian filling is invariant under legendrian isotopy ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the bound will be given in terms of the simple homotopy type of @xmath19 .",
    "first , we recall that such a legendrian submanifold automatically has a well - behaved chekanov - eliashberg algebra ; namely , an exact lagrangian filling induces an augmentation by @xcite . in the case",
    "when the projection of @xmath1 to @xmath20 is displaceable , the aforementioned result can thus be applied , giving the above arnold - type bound . however , in this case , there are even stronger bounds that can be obtained from the topology of the exact lagrangian filling @xmath19 ( and without the assumption of horizontal displaceability ) .",
    "see section [ sec : wrapped ] below for previous such results as well as an outline of the proof , which is based upon seidel s isomorphism in wrapped floer homology .",
    "this is also the starting point of the argument that we will use in order to prove our results here .    in the following",
    "we assume that a legendrian submanifold @xmath21 is chord - generic and has an exact lagrangian filling @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 denotes the coordinate on the first @xmath24-factor .",
    "in particular , the set of reeb chords @xmath25 of @xmath1 is finite .",
    "further , the set of reeb chords @xmath26 in degree @xmath27 will be denoted by @xmath28 , where the grading is induced by the conley - zehnder index modulo the maslov number @xmath29 of @xmath19 as defined in @xcite .",
    "observe that @xmath30 in particular implies that the first chern class of @xmath6 vanishes on @xmath31 .",
    "for a group @xmath32 being the epimorphic image of @xmath33 , consider the morse homology complex @xmath34),\\partial_f)$ ] of @xmath19 with coefficients in the group ring @xmath35 $ ] twisted by the fundamental group , where @xmath36 is a unital commutative ring and @xmath37 is a morse function satisfying @xmath38 outside of a compact set .",
    "( the generators of this complex are graded by the morse index , and the differential counts negative gradient flow lines . )",
    "[ mainthmsmplehomeqnts ] let @xmath22 be an exact lagrangian filling of an @xmath39-dimensional closed legendrian submanifold @xmath40 with fundamental group @xmath41 and maslov number @xmath29 .    * in the case when the filling is spin and when @xmath30 , the morse homology complex @xmath42),\\partial_f)$ ] is simple homotopy equivalent to a @xmath43$]-equivariant complex @xmath44\\langle \\mathcal{q}_{n-\\bullet}(\\lambda ) \\rangle,\\partial)$ ] ; * in the general case , it follows that the complex @xmath45),\\partial_f)$ ] is homotopy equivalent in the category of @xmath32-equivariant complexes to a complex @xmath46\\langle \\mathcal{q}_{n-\\bullet}(\\lambda ) \\rangle,\\partial)$ ] with grading in @xmath47 . here",
    "we can always take @xmath48 , while we are free to choose an arbitrary unital commutative ring in the case when @xmath19 is spin .",
    "we prove theorem  [ mainthmsmplehomeqnts ] in section  [ maintheoremanditsconsequences ] .",
    "now let @xmath49 denote the stable morse number of a manifold @xmath50 with possibly non - empty boundary , see definition [ defn : stablemorse ] . using theorem  [ mainthmsmplehomeqnts ] and the adaptation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.2 ) to the case of manifolds with boundary ( see proposition [ prop : morse ] ) , the following result is immediate :    [ maininequalitystablemorsenumberofafilling ] suppose that @xmath51 is a chord - generic closed legendrian submanifold admitting an exact lagrangian filling @xmath19 which is spin and has vanishing maslov number .",
    "it follows that the bound latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath604 is a subgroup of @xmath605 $ ] generated by @xmath606-[\\phi(h)]$ ] .",
    "the proof can , for example , be deduced from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 29 ) .",
    "then we describe a series of finite solvable groups @xmath607 with the property that @xmath608 , @xmath609)=1 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath610 be a finite field with @xmath611 elements , where @xmath612 is a prime number .",
    "we define a group @xmath613 , where @xmath614 acts on the additive group @xmath615 by @xmath616 , @xmath617 , @xmath618 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath607 is a solvable group .",
    "this follows from the existence of the following subnormal series @xmath619 where @xmath620 and @xmath621",
    ".    then we observe that from formula  [ absemiddirprreltohsh ] it follows that @xmath622\\simeq { \\mathbb{f}}^{\\ast}_q$ ] is a non - trivial cyclic group .",
    "therefore , @xmath609)=1 $ ] .",
    "finally we prove that @xmath608 .",
    "since @xmath623 and @xmath624 , we get that @xmath625 .",
    "we first show that @xmath626 .",
    "assume that @xmath607 has a generating set @xmath627 with @xmath628 , @xmath629 and @xmath630 .",
    "then , note that every element in the group generated by @xmath631 has a form @xmath632 , where @xmath633 , @xmath634 , and @xmath635 .",
    "this leads to the contradiction with the fact that @xmath623 .",
    "then we take a set of generators @xmath631 and @xmath636 with the property that @xmath330 is a generator of @xmath637 ( @xmath637 is a cyclic group ) .",
    "such an element definitely exists since if all the elements of @xmath631 are of the form @xmath638 , where @xmath496 is not a generator of @xmath637 , then @xmath631 is not a generating set of @xmath607 .",
    "again , @xmath637 is a cyclic group of order @xmath639 , and the order of @xmath330 that we denote by @xmath640 is coprime to @xmath641 .",
    "this implies that @xmath642 is coprime to @xmath641 , and hence none of the primes which divide @xmath643 will divide @xmath644=|{\\mathbb{f}}^m_q|$ ] .",
    "let @xmath282 be the set of primes which divide @xmath640 .",
    "then @xmath645 and @xmath646 are two hall @xmath282-subgroups , and hence by theorem  [ conjpihallsubgr ] they are conjugate by some element @xmath647 .",
    "this implies that @xmath631 , after conjugation , contains an element @xmath648 , where @xmath649 is a generator of @xmath637 .",
    "we also would like to mention that it is possible to find @xmath173 explicitly without relying on the theory of hall @xmath282-subgroups .",
    "then , already knowing that @xmath626 , we can apply the previous argument and see that , in fact , @xmath650 . together with the fact that @xmath625 we get that @xmath608 .    using proposition [ constrrealizoffundgroup ] , we construct an exact lagrangian filling @xmath651 of a legendrian @xmath652 inside the standard contact vector space .",
    "then theorem [ intrineqabssi ] tells us that @xmath653 is satisfied for all representatives .    on the other hand ,",
    "the bound given by seidel s isomorphism is @xmath654 finally , note that the difference between the previous two bounds gets arbitrarily large as @xmath655 .",
