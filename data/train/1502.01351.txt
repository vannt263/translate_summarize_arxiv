    "in constructing a model for the self - assembly of addressable structures , we note that the designed interactions should be much stronger than any attractive interactions between subunits that are not adjacent in a correctly assembled structure .",
    "the designed interactions that stabilize the target structure can be described by a connectivity graph , @xmath0 , in which each vertex represents a distinct subunit and each edge indicates a correct bond .",
    "this graph allows us to describe the connectivity of the structure independently of the geometry and spatial organization of the building blocks . for structures constructed from dna bricks ,",
    "the edges of @xmath0 indicate the hybridization of dna strands with complementary sequences that are adjacent in the target structure . an example three - dimensional dna - brick structure is shown along with its connectivity graph in figures  [ fig : ramp_example]a and [ fig : ramp_example]b .    in an ideal solution with exclusively designed interactions ,",
    "the subunits assemble into clusters in which all allowed bonds are encoded in the connectivity graph of the target structure . in order to compute the free - energy difference between a particular cluster size and the unbonded single - stranded bricks",
    ", we must consider all the ways in which a correctly bonded cluster with a given number of monomers can be assembled .",
    "these ` fragments ' of the target structure correspond to connected subgraphs of the connectivity graph . in a dilute solution with strong designed interactions ,",
    "the numbers of edges and vertices are the primary factors determining the stability of a particular fragment .",
    "we therefore identify all of the possible on - pathway assembly intermediates by grouping fragments into sets with the same number of edges and vertices and counting the total number of fragments in each set.@xcite    this theoretical approach is powerful because it can predict the free - energy landscape as a function of the degree of assembly between the monomers and the target structure .",
    "furthermore , the predicted landscape captures the precise topology of the target structure , which is essential for understanding the assembly of addressable , finite - sized structures . in the case of dna - brick structures",
    ", we can assign dna hybridization free energies to the edges of the target connectivity graph in order to determine the temperature dependence of the free - energy landscape ; for example , figure  [ fig : ramp_example]d shows the free - energy profile of the 86-strand dna - brick structure with random dna sequences at three temperatures .",
    "our theoretical approach allows us to calculate the nucleation barrier , @xmath1 , by examining the free energies of clusters corresponding to fragments with exactly @xmath2 vertices .",
    "the critical number of strands required for nucleation is @xmath3 : transient clusters with fewer than @xmath3 strands are more likely to dissociate than to continue incorporating additional strands .",
    "the presence of a substantial nucleation barrier therefore inhibits the proliferation of large , partially assembled fragments that stick together to form non - target aggregates .",
    "over a significant range of temperatures , we find that the free - energy profiles of dna - brick structures exhibit both a nucleation barrier and a thermodynamically stable intermediate structure . the nucleation barrier is associated with the minimum number of subunits that must be assembled in order to complete one or more _ cycles _ , i.e.  closed loops of stabilizing bonds in a fragment .",
    "for example , the critical number of monomers in the example structure at 319  k , @xmath4 , is one fewer than the nine subunits required to form a bicyclic fragment of the target structure . under the conditions where nucleation is rate controlling , the minimum free - energy structure is _ not _ the complete 86-particle target structure , but rather a structure with only @xmath5 particles .",
    "this incomplete structure is favored by entropy , since it can be realized in many more ways than the unique target structure .",
    "hence , the temperature where nucleation is rate controlling is higher than the temperature where the target structure is the most stable cluster .",
    "the existence of thermodynamically stable intermediates is a typical feature of dna - brick structures and of complex addressable , finite - sized structures in general .",
    "this behavior is not compatible with classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) , which predicts that , beyond the nucleation barrier , large clusters are always more stable than smaller clusters . as a consequence , in ` classical ' nucleation scenarios such as crystallization",
    ", there is a sharp boundary in temperature and concentration at which the largest - possible ordered structure , rather than the monomeric state , becomes thermodynamically stable .",
    "typically , a simple fluid must be supersaturated well beyond this boundary in order to reduce the nucleation barrier , which arises due to the competition between the free - energy penalty of forming a solid  liquid interface and the increased stability due to the growth of an ordered structure.@xcite yet in the case of addressable self - assembly , and dna bricks in particular , a nucleation barrier for the formation of a stable partial structure may exist even when the target structure is unstable relative to the free monomers .    an experiment to assemble such a structure requires a _ protocol _ : first nucleation at a relatively high temperature , and then further cooling to complete the formation of the target structure .",
    "this behavior can be seen in figure  [ fig : ramp_example]e , where we identify a narrow temperature window in which there is a significant yet surmountable nucleation barrier . unlike cnt , the nucleation barrier does not diverge as the temperature is increased . instead , there is a well - defined temperature above which all clusters have a higher free energy than the free monomers .",
    "as the temperature is lowered further , the nucleation barrier disappears entirely before the equilibrium yield , defined as the fraction of all clusters that are correctly assembled as the complete target structure , increases measurably above zero .",
    "the equilibrium yield tends to 100% at low temperatures , since we have thus far assumed that only designed interactions are possible .",
    "therefore , because of the presence of stable intermediate structures , it is typically impossible to assemble the target structure completely at any temperature where nucleation is rate controlling .        in order to examine the importance of a nucleation barrier for preventing misassembly , we calculate the free - energy difference between all off - pathway intermediates and all on - pathway intermediates , @xmath6 , by estimating the probability of incidental interactions between partially assembled structures.@xcite from the connectivity graph of the example dna - brick structure , we can calculate the total free energy of aggregated clusters by considering all the ways that partially assembled structures can interact via the dangling ends of the single - stranded bricks , as shown in figure  [ fig : ramp_example]c .",
    "we also estimate this free - energy difference in the case of slow nucleation , @xmath7 , by only allowing one of the interacting clusters in a misassembled intermediate to have @xmath8 .",
    "the above analysis supports our claim that a substantial nucleation barrier is essential for accurate self - assembly .",
    "our calculations show that even with very weak incidental interactions , incorrect bonding between the multiple dangling ends of large partial structures prevents error - free assembly at equilibrium , since @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of a nucleation barrier slows the approach to equilibrium , maintaining the viability of the correctly assembled clusters .",
    "these theoretical predictions are confirmed by extensive monte carlo simulations of the structure shown in figure  [ fig : ramp_example]a . in these simulations ,",
    "the dna bricks are modeled as rigid particles that move on a cubic lattice , but otherwise the sequence complementarity and the hybridization free energies of the experimental system are preserved.@xcite using realistic dynamics,@xcite we simulate the assembly of the target structure using a single copy of each monomer . in figure",
    "[ fig : ramp_example]f , we compare a representative trajectory from a simulation using a linear temperature ramp with a trajectory from a constant - temperature simulation starting from free monomers in solution .",
    "we also report the largest stable cluster size averaged over many such trajectories in figure  [ fig : ramp_example]g .",
    "nucleation first occurs within the predicted nucleation window where @xmath10 . at 319  k ,",
    "the size of the largest stable cluster coincides precisely with the predicted average cluster size at the free - energy minimum in figure  [ fig : ramp_example]d .",
    "intermediate structures assembled via a temperature ramp continue to grow at lower temperatures , while clusters formed directly from a solution of free monomers become arrested in conformations that are incompatible with further growth ( figure  [ fig : ramp_example]f,_inset _ ) . in agreement with our theoretical predictions ,",
    "the simulation results demonstrate that a time - dependent protocol is essential for correctly assembling a complete dna - brick structure .",
    "in the modular assemblies reported in ref .  , the maximum coordination number of bricks in the interior of the structure is four .",
    "however , one can envisage other building blocks , such as functionalized molecular constructs or nano - colloids , that have a different coordination number . to investigate the effect of the coordination number on the nucleation barrier",
    ", we compare the free - energy profile of a 48-strand dna - brick structure with those of two higher - coordinated structures ( figure  [ fig : coordination_number]a ) : a simple cubic structure with coordination number @xmath11 and a close - packed structure with @xmath12 .",
    "( for a discussion of two - dimensional structures , see sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] . ) in figure  [ fig : coordination_number]b , we show the free - energy profiles at 50% yield assuming identical bond energies within each structure .",
    "one striking difference between the @xmath13 structure and the higher - coordinated examples is the stability of the target at 50% yield . in the dna - brick structure ,",
    "the target structure coexists in nearly equal populations with a partial structure that is missing a single cycle . in the structures with higher coordination numbers , however , the target has the same free energy as the free monomers at 50% yield .",
    "intermediate structures are therefore globally unstable at all temperatures , as predicted by cnt .",
    "a second point of distinction among these structures lies in the relative stability of intermediate cluster sizes .",
    "whereas the dna - brick structure assembles by completing individual cycles , the cubic structure grows by adding one face at a time to an expanding cuboid . with @xmath12 , the greater diversity of fragments with",
    "the same number of vertices smooths out the free - energy profile near the top of the nucleation barrier .",
    "the fitted black line in figure  [ fig : coordination_number]b shows that the assembly of this structure does in fact obey cnt ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : cnt ] ) .",
    "the differences among these free - energy profiles originate from the topologies of the connectivity graphs of the example structures .",
    "the most important determinant of the nucleation behavior is simply the number of vertices required to complete each additional cycle in the target connectivity graph , which is controlled by the maximum coordination number of the subunits . ) and thus does not affect the shape of the free - energy profile . ]",
    "our findings imply that controlled self - assembly of three - dimensional addressable structures is unlikely to be achieved straightforwardly using subunits with coordination numbers higher than four . in higher - coordinated structures , which are well described by cnt",
    ", it would be necessary to go to high supersaturation in order to find a surmountable nucleation barrier ; however , such an approach is likely to fail due to kinetic trapping.@xcite yet in dna - brick structures , the nucleation barrier is surmountable at low supersaturation and is relatively insensitive to the size of the target structure ( figure  [ fig : coordination_number]c ) .",
    "the reliable self - assembly of large dna - brick structures is thus a direct consequence of the small number of bonds made by each brick .",
    "recent publications have argued that equal bond energies should enhance the stability of the designed structure@xcite and reduce errors during growth.@xcite by contrast , we find that the kinetics of dna - brick assembly are actually worse if one selects dna sequences that minimize the variance in the bond energies .",
    "our observation is consistent with the successful use of random dna sequences in the original experiments with dna bricks.@xcite here again , the nucleation behavior is responsible for this unexpected result .    to demonstrate the difference between random dna sequences and sequences chosen to yield monodisperse bond energies , we consider the relatively simple non - convex dna - brick structure shown in figure  [ fig : central_hole]a .",
    "this 74-brick structure , constructed by removing the interior strands and two faces from a cuboidal structure , assembles roughly face - by - face when using random dna sequences . the relevant nucleation barrier , as predicted theoretically in figure  [ fig : central_hole]b and confirmed with monte carlo simulations in figure  [ fig : central_hole]c , is the completion of the third face . with monodisperse bond energies and an equivalent mean interaction strength ,",
    "a much larger nucleation barrier appears before the first face forms .",
    "attempts to reduce this nucleation barrier by increasing the mean bond energy result in kinetic trapping and arrested growth . despite promising fluctuations in the largest cluster size in the simulation trajectory with monodisperse energies , multiple competing nuclei appear , and the largest cluster remains poorly configured for further assembly ( figure  [ fig : central_hole]c,_inset _ ) .",
    "the use of sequences with a broad distribution of hybridization free energies results in a more suitable nucleation barrier because such a distribution selectively stabilizes small and floppy intermediate structures .",
    "this is a statistical effect : since there are far fewer ways of constructing a maximally connected fragment with a given number of monomers , the chance that randomly assigned sequences concentrate the strongest bonds in a compact fragment is vanishingly small in a large structure . as a result ,",
    "the dominant nucleation pathways no longer need to follow the maximally connected fragments .",
    "the use of a broad distribution of bond energies therefore tends to reduce nucleation barriers , since unstable fragments near the top of a barrier contain fewer cycles and are thus affected more significantly by the variance in the bond - energy distribution .",
    "the insights provided by our predictive theory allow us to understand the general principles underlying the unexpected success of dna - brick self - assembly .",
    "slow , controlled nucleation at low supersaturation is achieved for large structures since each brick can only make a small number of designed connections . because of an appreciable nucleation barrier that appears in a narrow temperature window , monomer depletion does not pose a significant problem for one - pot assembly .",
    "surprisingly , complex structures with randomly selected complementary dna sequences experience enhanced nucleation , making larger intermediate structures kinetically accessible at higher temperatures .",
    "the use of a temperature ramp plays a more crucial role than previously thought .",
    "cooling the dna - brick solution slowly is not just a convenient way of locating good assembly conditions , as in the case of conventional crystals ; rather , it is an essential non - equilibrium protocol for achieving error - free assembly of finite - sized structures .",
    "the explanation of slow nucleation and fast growth that was originally proposed in refs .   and is therefore incomplete : fast growth allows the dna bricks to assemble into a stable , on - pathway intermediate that must be annealed at lower temperatures to complete the target structure .",
    "remaining out of equilibrium throughout the assembly protocol , as is necessary in order to avoid the aggregation of partial structures , relies on the slow diffusion of large intermediates .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , since the rate of diffusion changes approximately inversely with the radius of a fragment in solution.@xcite    our approach also suggests how to improve the design of dna - brick nanostructures beyond the random selection of uniformly distributed dna sequences . for a given target structure , it is easy to tune the nucleation barrier by adjusting the statistical distribution of bond energies .",
    "complementary dna sequences can then be assigned to the structure in order to achieve the desired distribution of hybridization free energies .",
    "furthermore , with an understanding of the origin of the nucleation barrier in a particular structure , it is possible to optimize the annealing protocol rationally in order to increase the yield of the target assembly .",
    "our approach also provides a means of systematically investigating how local modifications to the coordination number through the fusing of adjacent strands affect the nucleation behavior of dna - brick structures.@xcite    the theoretical method used here greatly simplifies the quantitative prediction of nucleation barriers and intermediate structures with widespread applications for controlling the self - assembly of biomolecular or synthetic building blocks .",
    "addressable self - assembly holds great promise for building intricate three - dimensional structures that are likely to require optimization on a case - by - case basis . because our predictive theory is sensitive to the details of a particular target structure , performing these calculations for nanostructures of experimental interest will enable the precise engineering of assembly properties at the design stage . in order for potential users to perform such experimental protocol design ,",
