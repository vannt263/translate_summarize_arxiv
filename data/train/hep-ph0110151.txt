    "in spite of a huge experimental effort , the higgs particle , the last missing ingredient of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions has not been discovered yet . for a higgs - boson mass @xmath4",
    "the most promising production channel has been the radiation off a @xmath5-boson at lep2 : @xmath6 ; using this reaction the lep data provided a limit  @xcite on the sm higgs - boson mass : @xmath7 .",
    "the higgs particle also contributes radiatively to several well measured quantities , this can be used to derive an upper bound  @xcite on @xmath8 : @xmath9 at 95 % c.l .. however , one should be aware that both limits are highly model - dependent .",
    "there exist other theoretical restrictions of @xmath10 based on the so - called triviality and vacuum stability arguments . as it is well know  @xcite the renormalized @xmath11 theory can not contain an interaction term ( @xmath12 ) for any non - zero scalar mass : the theory must be trivial . within a perturbative approach the statement corresponds to the fact that for any non - zero scalar mass ( since the mass is @xmath13 this condition corresponds to a non - vanishing initial value for the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of @xmath14 ) there exists a finite energy scale at which @xmath14 diverges ( the landau pole ) .",
    "consequently , only for zero scalar mass the theory can be consistent for all energy scales .",
    "an analogous effect occurs in the scalar sector of the sm ( modified to some extend by the presence of gauge and yukawa interactions ) .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily implies zero higgs - boson mass since there is no reason to believe the sm is valid at arbitrarily high energy scale .",
    "for example , it is often assumed that the sm represents the low energy limit of some underlying more fundamental theory whose heavy excitations decouple at low energy , but become manifest at a scale @xmath2 . within that scenario",
    "the sm is an effective theory valid possibly only at the energy scale of the order of the fermi scale : @xmath15 .",
    "if the sm is to be accurate for energies below @xmath16 the landau pole should occur at scale @xmath16 or above , and this condition gives a ( @xmath2-dependent ) upper bound on @xmath17  @xcite . on the other hand , for sufficiently small @xmath17 radiative corrections can destabilize the ground state .",
    "this occurs if the scalar self coupling constant @xmath18 becomes negative at some scale that can be identified with the scale of new physics @xmath2 . alternatively requiring the sm vacuum to be stable for scales below @xmath19 implies a lower bound on @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the consequences of the above arguments ( triviality and vacuum stability ) are usually discussed assuming sm interactions . however",
    ", if the scale of new physics is sufficiently low ( of the order of a few tev ) one could expect that the non - standard interactions would modify the electroweak theory at the lower scale and influence the scalar potential in such a way that the above bounds on the higgs - boson mass are changed .",
    "the problem deserves a special attention in the context of possible higgs - boson discovery  @xcite at lep2 at the mass @xmath20 since in this case the sm constraint from vacuum stability requires @xmath21  @xcite ( the precise number depends on the top quark mass ) with the attractive possibility that @xmath19 is actually much lower .",
    "it then becomes interesting to determine the manner in which heavy physics with scales in the @xmath22 region modify the stability and triviality bounds on the higgs - boson mass . in this lecture",
    "we address this question in a model - independent way .",
    "we parameterize the heavy physics effects using an effective lagrangian satisfying the sm gauge symmetries . since lhc , the future proton - proton collider ,",
    "is expected to be sensitive to scales @xmath16 of the order of a few tev , the results will be presented for scales between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ non_stand ] , we define the lagrangian relevant for our discussion",
    ". section  [ triv_bound ] is devoted to the derivation of the triviality bound including effects of non - standard interactions . in section  [ vac_bound ] ,",
    "we calculate the effective potential with one insertion of an effective operator and discuss its consequences for the vacuum stability bounds .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "our study of the stability and triviality constraints on the higgs - boson mass will be based on the sm lagrangian modified by the addition of a series of effective operators whose coefficients parameterize the low - energy effects of the heavy physics  @xcite . assuming that these non - standard effects decouple implies  @xcite that the operators appear multiplied by appropriate inverse powers of @xmath16 .",
    "the leading effects are then generated by operators of mass - dimension 6 ( dimension 5 operators necessarily violate lepton number  @xcite and are associated with new physics at very large scales ; so we can safely ignore their effects ) . given our emphasis on higgs - boson physics the effects of all fermions excepting the top - quark",
    "can be ignored  .",

    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote a covariant derivative and @xmath32 , @xmath33 field strength whose couplings we denote by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the factors @xmath36 are unknown coefficients that parameterize the low - energy effects of the non - standard interactions and we have neglected contributions @xmath37 . in addition , for weakly coupled theories , the @xmath38 that can be generated only through loop effects are sub - dominant as they are suppressed by numerical factors @xmath39  @xcite ; hence we will consider only those operators that can be generated at tree - level by the heavy physics .",
    "even with all the above restrictions there remain 16 operators that involve exclusively the fields in ( [ lagrangian ] ) . of these only 5 contribute directly to the effective potential , the remaining 11 affect the results only through their rg mixing which , being suppressed by a factor @xmath40 are expected to play a sub - dominant role . in the calculations below",
    "we will include only one of these operators ; our results do justify the claim that the corresponding effects are small .",

    "in order to test the high energy behavior of the scalar potential one has to derive the rg running equations for @xmath14 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 functions for these parameters are influenced by all the operators in ( [ operators ] ) and by the gauge and yukawa interactions , so the full rg evolution also require the @xmath51 function for the corresponding couplings . both for the @xmath50 functions and",
