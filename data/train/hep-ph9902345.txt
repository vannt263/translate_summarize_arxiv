    "a complete description of the momentum and spin degrees of freedom of quarks and antiquarks in the nucleon requires , at leading twist , the definition of three sets of parton distributions .",
    "two of them , the momentum distribution @xmath2 and the helicity distribution @xmath3 , have been intensively investigated in the last few years ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) while the so called transversity distribution , @xmath4 , has come to the attention of theorists and experimentalists more recently in the analysis of drell  yan spin asymmetries @xcite .",
    "the main reason why it has passed unnoticed for such a longtime is related to its chiral - odd character . if quark masses are neglected in the qcd lagrangian , no interaction at lowest order of perturbation theory , can flip chirality . as a consequence ,",
    "transversity is strongly suppressed ( by powers of @xmath5 ) in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) and in general in any hard process that involves only one parton distribution . in hadron - hadron collisions",
    "the chirality of the partons that annihilate is uncorrelated and the previous restrictions do not apply .",
    "recently there has been a number of proposals to measure the transversity parton distributions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "lepton pair production in doubly polarized drell - yan processes are among the proposed scenarios and such experiments are included in the research program at rhic and the hera-@xmath1 project @xcite . the feasibility of measurements of double transverse asymmetries ( @xmath6 ) at polarized @xmath7 colliders ( rhic ) and fixed - target experiments ( hera-@xmath1 ) has been recently studied @xcite .",
    "the expected maximal value for @xmath6 at the kinematic range covered by rhic is around 1 - 2 % , which would be difficult to measure with the present acceptances . for hera-@xmath1 , @xmath6 is expected to reach values as large as 5 % .",
    "along with the experimental prospects , many efforts have also been made on the theoretical side @xcite .",
    "in particular jaffe and ji calculated @xmath8 within the bag model of the nucleon @xcite , pointing out the relativistic character of the differences between transverse and longitudinal polarization properties .",
    "the calculation of leading order ( lo ) @xcite and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite anomalous dimensions allowed to address quantitatively the differences between @xmath9 and @xmath8 due to perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) evolution in different models @xcite . in particular , scopetta and vento have shown that pqcd differences are sizeable only for low values of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the boundary conditions of the evolution equations , that are provided by the low energy input at the hadronic scale @xmath12 ( @xmath13 gev@xmath14 ) , can yield an additional , non perturbative , difference . as it was stressed by jaffe and ji @xcite , at this scale",
    "the equality @xmath15 is a typical outcome of non - relativistic models of the nucleon , in which motion and spin observables are uncorrelated . in other words ,",
    "any departure from the previous identity is a signature of relativity in the employed hadronic model .",
    "a complete theoretical study of @xmath8 and @xmath9 has to account for both : the relativistic effects which distinguish @xmath8 from @xmath9 at the non - perturbative scale , and the pqcd evolution which differs for the two structure functions .",
    "aim of the present work is the quantitative study of the relativistic effects in @xmath8 and @xmath9 due to the correlations of spin and parton motion in the hadronic systems . for this purpose",
    "we use light - front dynamics formalism in which the interplay between motion and spin is made explicit through the melosh rotations .",
    "in particular , we make use of the light - front covariant ( lfc ) quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite to compute the leading twist contribution to the matrix elements at the hadronic scale @xmath16 .",
    "the non - perturbative input is then evolved , at nlo , up to a higher @xmath0 scale . we shall show that relativistic corrections introduced at @xmath16 clearly survive evolution",
    ". measurements of observables involving transverse and longitudinal asymmetries might put in evidence the corrections to the naive non - relativistic spin picture adopted in low - energy models of the nucleon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ lfc ] the framework to calculate @xmath8 and @xmath9 within the lfc quark model is described and a specific observable , related to double spin asymmetry experiments , is defined .",
    "the definition is such that the view on relativistic spin effects is optimized .",
    "results in the kinematic range covered by rhic and hera-@xmath1 are presented in section [ res ] , where the feasibility of the detection of these effects is also discussed .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ concl ] .",
    "the helicity distribution @xmath17 of a parton with flavour @xmath18 is defined as the probability of having a ( longitudinally ) polarized parton @xmath18 with spin parallel to the longitudinal polarization of the parent nucleon minus the probability of finding the parton polarized in the opposite direction .",
    "a similar definition applies to @xmath19 for transverse polarizations @xcite .    in the quark model",
    "a simple approach can be developed to connect parton and momentum densities at the hadronic scale @xmath12 where valence degrees of freedom dominate the matrix elements at leading twist @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite can be related to the longitudinal and transverse quark momentum densities respectively .",
    "namely :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the three - momentum of the struck quark , @xmath24 is the nucleon mass , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the density of ( valence ) quarks with momentum @xmath23 and longitudinal polarization aligned ( antialigned ) with the longitudinal polarization of the parent nucleon . a similar notation ( @xmath27 ) is used for transverse polarization .",
    "the explicit expressions for the densities are :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the flavour projector .    in any non - relativistic description of the wave function",
    "the densities ( [ naupdef ] ) and ( [ nafwdef ] ) are equal and hence @xmath30 as discussed by jaffe and ji @xcite .",
    "however the degeneracy is removed by relativistic covariance requirements , such as those which are implemented in the covariant quark models based on light - front dynamics @xcite .",
    "light - front dynamics with a fixed number of particles has been widely discussed in the literature ( see @xcite for reviews ) , so that it is enough to highlight briefly the main features of the angular momentum in this formalism . in relativistic quantum theories",
    ", the angular momentum operator is obtained from the generators of the poincar group . in the light front form of the dynamics problems",
    "arise when considering addition of angular momenta , because usual composition rules are not satisfied . nevertheless , it is possible to restore them by means of a unitary transformation : the melosh rotation @xcite . from the physical viewpoint",
    "these transformations relate the angular momentum eigenstates in a subsystem rest frame ( a quark , for example ) to the centre of mass frame . for spin 1/2 particles the melosh rotations ( mr ) that link light - front to",
    "canonical spin states are represented by :    @xmath31 = \\frac{(m+\\omega+k_z ) - i \\vec{\\sigma } \\cdot ( \\hat{z } \\times \\vec{k}_\\perp ) } { ( ( m+\\omega+k_z)^2 + \\vec{k}_\\perp^{\\,2})^{1/2 } } \\;\\ ; , \\label{mr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the three - momentum of the particle and @xmath32 its relativistic energy .",
    "the fact that @xmath33 \\rightarrow 1 $ ] in the limit @xmath34 reveals the relativistic origin of the mr . a new spin - flavor basis",
    "is then defined ( the pauli - melosh basis ) in which the ordinary ( canonical ) pauli spinors for each individual particle are replaced by the melosh - rotated spinors :    @xmath35 \\chi_i^c = \\frac{(m_i+\\omega_i+k_{i_z } ) - i \\vec{\\sigma}^{(i ) } \\cdot ( \\hat{z } \\times \\vec{k}_{i_\\perp } ) } { ( ( m_i+\\omega_i+k_{i_z})^2 + \\vec{k}_{i_\\perp}^{\\,2})^{1/2 } } \\chi_i^c \\ ; , \\label{melosh2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 are the usual ( canonical ) pauli spinors for the particle @xmath37 .",
    "the pauli - melosh basis constitutes a minimal relativistic spin basis @xcite that , despite of its non - manifest covariance , is compatible with poincar invariance requirements .    in our calculation",
    "we shall refer to the wave function @xmath38 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the relativistic mass equation :    @xmath39    has been solved .",
    "the free relativistic mass operator @xmath40 is supplemented with an hypercentral phenomenological interaction    @xmath41    where the hyper - radius @xmath42 is a function of what , in a non relativistic treatment , is the vector position of the particles @xmath43 and the center of mass position @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constants fixed to reproduce the basic features of the low - energy baryonic spectrum pattern in the @xmath48 channels . since this interaction is invariant under rotations and",
    "does not depend on the total light - front momentum , all the commutation relations that guarantee the covariance requirement ( see @xcite ) are correctly satisfied .",
    "the advantage of the hypercentral interactions , well known in the non - relativistic limit @xcite , is that they allow a straightforward solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the resulting spin - isospin wave function is @xmath49 symmetric .",
    "it should be emphasized that the degeneracy between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the non - relativistic limit is independent of the presence of @xmath49breaking terms in the nucleon wave function .    from eq .",
    "( [ melosh2 ] ) it is evident the correlation between spin and motion in the pauli - melosh spin basis , so that the momentum densities ( [ naupdef ] ) and ( [ nafwdef ] ) are no longer equal , independently of its su(6)-symmetric character .",
    "differences between @xmath50 and @xmath51 are now proportional to the internal transverse momentum @xmath52 , as expected :    @xmath53 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times n(\\vec{k } ) \\ ; \\delta \\left ( \\frac{x}{1-x } - \\frac{k^+ } { m/\\sqrt{2}}\\right ) \\ ; , \\label{diff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is the unpolarized flavorless quark momentum density normalized to the number of particles as obtained by solving the mass equation ( [ rme ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ diff ] ) is one of the central results of the present work .",
    "it shows that differences between @xmath21 and @xmath20 have a clear relativistic origin depending on the kinematical structure of the mr .",
    "the @xmath10-dependence of the quantity @xmath55 is embodied in the wave function term @xmath54 . within a fully non - relativistic approach",
    "@xmath55 would vanish and the actual ( and identical ) values of @xmath21 and @xmath20 would be largely suppressed for @xmath56 due to the lack of high momentum components in @xmath54 for typical non - relativistic models @xcite .",
    "in fact the relativistic effects show up , in the present approach , in a twofold way : i ) mr introduce the non - vanishing difference @xmath55 of eq.([diff ] ) ; ii ) high momentum components in @xmath54 which are mostly originated by the relativistic kinetic energy in the mass equation ( [ rme ] ) and that reinforce the mr contribution , as discussed in ref.@xcite for @xmath20 .    concerning the scale dependence",
    ", it should be stressed that eq.([diff ] ) is valid at a low - energy ( hadronic ) scale @xmath12 , where the non - perturbative models used to calculate the twist - two matrix elements can be applied . at higher ( experimental ) scales @xmath57",
    "perturbative qcd evolution yields an additional contribution to the differences between longitudinal and transverse polarization observables ( cfr .",
    "section [ res ] ) .",
    "previous attempts @xcite to study the effects of mr in @xmath8 disregarded this scale dependence and did not include perturbative contributions .",
    "let us now discuss a specific combination of longitudinally and transversely polarized parton distributions , namely the ratio    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the charge of a quark of flavour @xmath18 .",
    "the arguments @xmath60 and @xmath61 are related , for drell - yan processes , to the center of mass energy @xmath62 , the invariant mass of the produced lepton pair @xmath0 , and the rapidity @xmath63 :    @xmath64    @xmath65 does not dependent on the unpolarized parton distribution and involves only the ratio between @xmath9 and @xmath8 . to this respect",
    "it is less model dependent than the single terms and is quite transparent for studying mr effects .    the flavor combination of transverse parton distributions in eq .",
    "( [ rdef ] ) appears in the lo double transverse asymmetry of drell - yan processes :    @xmath66    where the arrows denote the transverse polarization of the beam and target and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) is the polar ( azimuthal ) angle of the detected lepton .",
    "the corresponding lo asymmetry with longitudinally polarized hadrons , @xmath69 , is proportional to the combination of helicity distributions @xmath9 considered in eq .",
    "( [ rdef ] ) :    @xmath70    then , @xmath71 is just the ratio between double transverse and double longitudinal asymmetries at lo :    @xmath72    the evolution procedure we are going to use is a nlo procedure and therefore the parton distribution and the corresponding cross sections should be consistently evaluated at nlo . as a consequence the asymmetries do not assume the simple forms ( [ attdef ] ) and ( [ alldef ] ) .",
    "nevertheless it is still feasible to establish a rather close connection between the combinations that enter eq .",
    "( [ rdef ] ) and the nlo asymmetries .",
    "indeed , the differential cross section for longitudinally polarized process is written , at nlo , as @xcite :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the polarization of gluons and the coefficient @xmath75 .",
    "the nlo order coefficients are explicitly given in @xcite .",
    "the nlo order introduces on the one hand the polarization of the gluons due to the subprocess @xmath76 and on the other hand the coefficients @xmath77 that contain terms which are not proportional to @xmath78 and therefore break the relationship ( [ xdefs ] ) we have used in our calculation .",
    "a similar modification appears for the unpolarized dy cross section .",
    "nevertheless , an estimation of the asymmetry @xmath69 by using available parameterization of polarized parton distributions indicate that the nlo asymmetry is dominated by the @xmath79 of the @xmath80 subprocess in the central rapidity region .",
    "this term contains just the combination of polarized parton distributions that we are interested in and which enters in the ratio ( [ rdef ] ) .",
    "alternatively , it would also be possible to extract this combination of helicity parton distributions from other experiments .    in the transversely nlo polarized cross sections , gluons are absent since there is no equivalent transversity for gluons , and",
    "hence @xcite :    @xmath81    though the cross section is proportional to the combination of transversity distributions that we have used in ( [ rdef ] ) , the nlo order coefficient @xmath82 may spoil the relationship ( [ xdefs ] ) again .",
    "however , it was shown in ref.@xcite , that the dominant term in this coefficient ( and in the equivalent one for the unpolarized cross section ) is proportional to @xmath78 , so that it is still possible a rather direct extraction of the combination @xmath83 from the analysis of the transverse asymmetry at nlo .",
    "to reach the experimental regime we have evolved the calculated parton distributions from the hadronic scale up to a scale @xmath84 by using pqcd at nlo , in the @xmath85 scheme .",
    "the sensitivity to the factorization scheme in this approach has been tested in previous calculations @xcite and found to be generally small .",
    "the value of @xmath12 ( the hadronic scale ) is fixed @xcite by evolving backwards the parametrized experimental fits for unpolarized parton distributions @xcite , to the scale where the valence quarks carry the whole momentum of the nucleon .",
    "we found @xmath86 gev@xmath14 and the reliability of the pqcd evolution procedure at such low scale was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that the value @xmath87 gev@xmath14 is found by using an evolution code where the transcendental equation    @xmath88 = 0 \\label{trasceq}\\ ] ]    has been solved to get the nlo coupling constant .",
    "the use of the full nlo expression ( [ trasceq ] ) is mandatory when evolving from / to a low energy scale @xcite and the approximate solution    @xmath89 \\;\\ ; , \\label{appeq}\\ ] ]    which is valid for large values of @xmath90 and often used in nlo codes ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) , would introduce quite spurious effects .",
    "in particular , the evolution to energy scales as low as the hadronic point @xmath12 may yield a negative gluon contribution at @xmath12 , related to a large extent to the spurious effects introduced by eq.([appeq ] ) . in the present case , for example , evolving back the experimental fit @xcite to the hadronic scale @xmath87 gev@xmath14 , would give a fraction of momentum carried by the gluons of @xmath91 , which , although non - zero , is relatively small .",
    "obviously , the situation is much worse when eq .",
    "( [ appeq ] ) is used instead of eq .",
    "( [ trasceq ] ) .",
    "in addition , the evolution code to be used for hadronic model calculations must guarantee complete symmetry for the forward and backward paths @xmath92 and vice versa , as implied by genuine perturbative qcd expansion at nlo .",
    "additional approximations associated with taylor expansion valid for large @xmath93 , must be avoided , as discussed in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the curves for @xmath94 and @xmath95 at the hadronic scale @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) and at the partonic scale @xmath96 gev@xmath14 ( fig .",
    "a remarkable difference between @xmath97 and @xmath98 appears at large @xmath10 , reaching a peak at @xmath99 .",
    "quantitatively they are bigger that those obtained within bag models @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the probability of transverse polarization is larger than the longitudinal one when relativistic effects are considered .",
    "it is possible to appreciate better the mr effects by simply setting @xmath33 \\rightarrow 1 $ ] . in this case",
    "the remaining relativistic ingredient is the high momentum components generated by the relativized schrdinger equation ( [ rme ] ) .",
    "the results are also shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) and we get @xmath100 as expected .",
    "after evolution ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) we see that when the mr are neglected , @xmath9 and @xmath8 differ mainly at low @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) because of pqcd evolution @xcite , while the inclusion of the correlations between spin and motion produce large effects also in the medium and large @xmath10 region .    in order to study the effects of mr in the combination of polarized parton distributions we are interested in ,",
    "let us first consider the ratios    @xmath101    and    @xmath102    shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .",
    "2(b ) respectively as a function of the center of mass rapidity @xmath103 in a kinematic region ( @xmath104 gev , @xmath96 gev@xmath14 ) accessible by rhic experiments .",
    "these values are of the order of a few percent , compatible with those obtained in the literature ( see for instance @xcite , where antiquarks are considered also at the hadronic scale ) . again it is possible to single out the contribution introduced by mr switching them off . in general , mr reduce both @xmath105 and @xmath106 but this reduction is far more significant for @xmath106 .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the ratio @xmath107 as a function of @xmath103 ( in the same kinematical region ) when considering melosh rotations and when they are neglected .",
    "figure 3 represents our reference point to assess the importance of relativistic spin effects : they enhance the transverse ratio @xmath108 with respect to the longitudinal term @xmath109 .",
    "namely , if melosh rotations are taken into account @xmath110 in the considered kinematic regime . on the contrary , if the spin - motion correlations are neglected ( non - relativistic limit ) , then in the same region @xmath111 . experiments may decide between these two alternatives , therefore probing the relevance of covariance effects in the dynamical description of the nucleon spin .    before examining the possibility of measuring these effects",
    "let us discuss some issues concerning the previous results : the coupling of @xmath9 to the polarized gluons in the evolution at nlo and the dependence of @xmath71 on the spatial nucleon wave function .      in our valence model of the nucleon ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath112 and @xmath113 comes from evolution only . on qualitative grounds one would expect @xmath114 ( i.e. @xmath115 ) , since @xmath116 at lo vanishes while @xmath117 receives contributions also from the lowest order in @xmath118 .",
    "however , a careful analysis shows that this is not necessarily the case , since the final value of @xmath112 is not only determined by the order of @xmath118 but also from the behavior of the anomalous dimensions .",
    "more specifically , in order to understand why one gets @xmath119 , let us consider the dglap equations for the longitudinally polarized parton distributions @xcite to disentangle the coupling of @xmath117 to quarks , antiquarks and gluons :    @xmath120    @xmath121    where @xmath122 and @xmath123 corresponds to non - singlet combinations of @xmath20 and @xmath124 . for the sake of simplicity we will give results for @xmath125 at @xmath96 gev@xmath14 (",
    "conclusions are not changed for other @xmath0 points we have checked ) at lo .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the contribution to the derivative of @xmath126 due to the coupling to @xmath74 and to the terms proportional to the quarks and antiquarks at lo .",
    "the remarkable feature is the opposite sign of the coupling to the gluons and to the quarks+antiquarks at lo that makes the final derivative be not too large for @xmath127 .",
    "this partial cancellation between different contributions produces a rather slow increase of @xmath128 with @xmath0 at order @xmath129 and the final value of @xmath128 at nlo are comparable to that of @xmath130 .",
    "this happens for @xmath127 , while for smaller @xmath10 the growing of @xmath126 dominates over that of @xmath131 , due to some extent to the large size of the coupling to gluons , which is absent in the evolution of @xmath131 .",
    "it should be reminded that @xmath71 vanishes at leading order since the sea quarks are entirely generated through evolution .",
    "this fact prevent us from doing a quantitative comparison between the lo and nlo for @xmath71 .",
    "however , scopetta and vento @xcite analyzed the lo and nlo evolution for other flavour combinations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 and it was found that these differences between lo and nlo were not too large and went in the same direction for @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "at this point one can argue that these results for @xmath65 could be strongly influenced by the presence of high momentum components in the spatial part of the wave function , carried over by the presence of a relativistic kinetic energy in the mass operator .",
    "these components have been proved to be essential to describe electromagnetic transitions and elastic form factors @xcite and also the high @xmath10 region in dis @xcite .",
    "we have therefore repeated the calculation of the ratio @xmath65 starting from a nucleon wave function obtained by making use of a a non - relativistic kinetic energy in the mass operator ( cfr .",
    "( [ rme ] ) ) .",
    "the interaction has been kept of the same form ( [ potential ] ) , while the values of the parameters ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) have been reset according to ref @xcite .    the corresponding result for @xmath65",
    "is shown also in fig .",
    "3 . we can see that the ratio obtained from a fully non - relativistic model , lies reasonably close to the curve obtained employing a relativistic kinetic energy but neglecting melosh rotations .",
    "hence , we can safely conclude that @xmath65 is rather insensitive to the details of the mass operator , but very sensitive to the relativistic spin corrections derived from a light - front dynamics .",
    "this is not so evident for the values of @xmath105 or @xmath106 which are roughly doubled by the same change in the mass operator ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . this fact gives support to the suitability of the chosen observable .",
    "moreover , due to this insensitivity to the details of the spatial wave function , we do not expect a dramatic change of our conclusions for other more sophisticated potential models @xcite .      in order to study the feasibility of the experimental detection of the differences for @xmath71 we have to estimate the expected errors for @xmath71 under the conditions of rhic and hera@xmath1 .",
    "we have calculated the statistical errors according to the expression @xcite :    @xmath132    where @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) is the degree of polarization of the beam ( target ) , @xmath135 is the expected luminosity and @xmath136 is the efficiency in the detection of events .",
    "the unpolarized cross section @xmath137 is integrated over bins of @xmath138 and @xmath103 .    for rhic we have taken @xcite @xmath139 and a luminosity of 240 pb@xmath140 .",
    "the calculated errors for the figure 3 in the central rapidity region largely exceeds the separation between the two main curves , even by assuming a 100 % efficiency and integrating over an interval @xmath141 and @xmath142 around the central values .",
    "therefore , these effects will be unlikely to be observed at rhic .    for hera@xmath1",
    "the expected degrees of polarization are @xcite @xmath143 and @xmath144 with a projected luminosity of @xmath145 pb@xmath140",
    ". the center of mass energy will be @xmath146 gev , corresponding to a @xmath147 gev .",
    "we have checked that , though the error bars are far smaller than those obtained for rhic , relativistic spin effects can not be disentangled for @xmath71 in the region @xmath148 gev , @xmath149 .    in order to maximize the rates",
    "we will integrate over the whole range of @xmath103 :    @xmath150    the results for this ratio for the kinematics of hera@xmath1 are shown in figure 5 , where we can observe the same pattern of differences as the one seen in the y - dependent ratio ( fig .",
    "the relative insensitivity to the details of the chosen potential is also evident in this representation . in the error bars shown in fig .",
    "5 we have taken into account the limited acceptance of the detectors , as explained in @xcite , which roughly gives @xmath151 in the considered region .",
    "we have also assumed that @xmath152 . a measurement in the region @xmath153 gev can not single out which is the right spin - flavor basis , while experiments in the low mass region ( @xmath154 gev ) could be more selective , though some overlap between the error bars still persists .",
    "for rhic the acceptance corrections ( @xmath155 ) are too large to reveal relativistic differences .",
    "we have shown that drell - yan processes can probe the relativistic effects embodied in a light - front dynamical description of the low energy spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "for this purpose , the ratio @xmath71 turns out to be particularly suitable since it is largely independent of the structure of the mass operator and , therefore , of the choice of the phenomenological interaction .",
    "this insensitivity to the details of the spatial degrees of freedom is not so evident for each asymmetry @xmath105 and @xmath106 separately . while predictions for @xmath71 are robust , the given values for @xmath105 and @xmath106 should be considered just at a semiquantitative level .",
    "in fact , we have seen that relativistic spin effects would reduce @xmath105 and therefore the chance of measure it with respect to the maximal scenario presented in @xcite , but no definite quantitative conclusions about the feasibility of measuring transversity should be drawn from fig .",
    "2 .    by estimating the expected statistical errors for rhic and hera we have concluded that for hera@xmath1 it would be possible to determine the right spin - flavour basis for the nucleon wave function in the low mass region while this kind of measurement would be far more difficult at rhic .    in the present work",
    "we have limited ourselves to give predictions for d - y related observables in some kinematic regions accessible to rhic , but the model can be straightforwardly applied to other experimental conditions and to other kind of processes as well . in particular , the observed enhancement of the transverse polarization with respect to the longitudinal one may have some impact in the extraction of the twist-3 contribution to the spin structure function @xmath156 from dis experiments @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally let us emphasize that we have used a valence quark model to evaluate the parton distributions at the hadronic scale , neglecting sea quark ( and antiquark ) distributions at that scale .",
    "one could argue that the consideration of a non - vanishing @xmath157 and @xmath158 would mask the effects due to melosh rotations . though a quantitative study of the change in the initial conditions would require more elaborate models ( beyond the valence picture @xcite ) there are , however , some qualitative reasons to support the stability of the results presented in figs . 3 and 5 . a non - vanishing @xmath157 ( and @xmath158 )",
    "has two main consequences on the overall scheme : firstly it slightly raises the initial scale @xmath16 and on the other hand it changes the small @xmath10 behavior of the parton distributions .",
