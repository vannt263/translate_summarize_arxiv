    "the production of bubbles in weakly supersaturated solutions of carbon dioxide is of great interest to the beverage industry .",
    "such solutions include many soft drinks and beers , as well as sparkling wines and champagne .",
    "while it has long been appreciated that spontaneous bubble formation in these liquids is strongly inhibited and thus that bubble formation can only occur at certain nucleation sites  @xcite , it is only comparatively recently that the nature of these sites has been fully elucidated . in a series of papers",
    ", liger - belair and co - workers demonstrated that the most important nucleation sites are pockets of gas trapped in cellulose fibres  @xcite ( an example of type iv nucleation in the classification of jones et al .",
    "@xcite ) and developed a mathematical model of the growth and detachment of these bubbles  @xcite , ( a complementary model making slighly different assumptions was developed by uzel et al .",
    ".    while most beers are carbonated , there are advantages to using a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in beers , as is done in a number of stouts .",
    "( hereafter , the term ` stout ' will be used to refer to a beer containing a mixture of dissolved nitrogen and carbon dioxide . )",
    "these advantages include lower acidity in the beer leading to an improved taste ; and smaller bubbles giving a creamy mouthfeel and a long lasting head  @xcite .",
    "these beers are interesting scientifically because they show interesting fluid dynamical phenomena such as roll waves  @xcite and sinking bubbles  @xcite . also of scientific interest",
    "is the technology used to create the head in the canned products .    pouring a carbonated beer from the can into a glass is enough to generate the head .",
    "this is not the case for stouts . foaming in canned stouts",
    "is promoted by a widget : a hollow ball containing pressurised gas . when the can is opened , the widget depressurises by releasing a gas jet into the beer .",
    "the jet breaks up into tiny bubbles which are carried throughout the liquid by the turbulent flow generated by the gas jet and by pouring the beer into a glass .",
    "dissolved gasses diffuse from the liquid into the bubbles which rise to the surface of the beer to form the head .    in this paper",
    "we extend the mathematical model of bubble formation in carbonated liquids developed by liger - belair et al .",
    "@xcite to the case of two dissolved gasses and use it to investigate two questions :    * why do stout beers require widgets ?",
    "is the bubbling mechanism described by liger - belair et al .",
    "completely inactive in stout beers or merely very slow ? * could an alternative to the widget be developed by coating part of the inside of the can by hollow fibres ?",
    ".[parameters ] values of parameters used in this work . [ cols=\"^,>,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the limit @xmath0 equations  [ dimensionless_one ] and  [ dimensionless_two ] become @xmath1 these equations have two independent solutions @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be chosen independently to satisfy initial conditions .",
    "the numerical values of the other parameters are given in table  [ eigenvectors ] .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath6 case allows us to interpret these two solutions . the first solution , equation  [ eva ] , decays exponentially with a small timescale .",
    "this corresponds to the rapid establishment of the ( dynamic ) equilibrium concentrations ( or partial pressures ) of co@xmath7 and n@xmath7 within the gas pocket ( assumed instantaneous in the previous analysis ) .",
    "the second solution , equation  [ evb ] , shows exponential growth with a longer timescale .",
    "this describes the steady state growth of the gas pocket at a fixed concentration ratio of co@xmath7 to n@xmath7 .",
    "the timescale of this process describes the timescale of bubble production .",
    "this analysis produces a longer estimate of that timescale than the previous analysis .",
    "this is because , previously , diffusion of co@xmath7 was assumed to be instantaneous . as the numerical results described in the next section show , the @xmath6 limit underestimates the correct timescale , while the @xmath0 analysis gives a good estimate .",
    "results of the numerical solution of equations  [ dimensionless_one ] and  [ dimensionless_two ] .",

    "was used to solve equations  [ dimensionless_one ] and  [ dimensionless_two ] with initial conditions @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the differential equations were solved over the interval @xmath11 . the result for @xmath12 for @xmath13",
    "were fitted to an exponential curve giving a dimensionless bubble growth timescale of @xmath14 corresponding to a dimensional timescale of @xmath15 , in agreement with that predicted from the analysis of the @xmath0 case .",
    "this can be compared with the value for carbonated liquids at the same total pressure : @xmath16 .",
    "[ graphs ] shows the results of the numerical simulations over the interval @xmath17 .    in conclusion ,",
    "these analytic and numerical results suggest that the mechanism of bubble formation described by liger - belair et al .  is potentially active in stout beers but acts much more slowly than in carbonated drinks .",

    "[ fibre ] is shown . ]    to confirm experimentally that cellulose fibres could nucleate bubbles in stout beer , we observed a canned draught stout in contact with cellulose fibres ( taken from a coffee filter ) . before opening the can",
    ", we made a small hole in the can to slowly degass the widget .",
    "this prevented it from foaming , which would have removed the dissolved gasses from solution . using a microscope we observed that bubbles were indeed nucleated from the cellulose fibres but at a relatively slow rate .",
    "[ fibre ] shows bubbles nucleated by a gas pocket : the three parts of fig .",
    "[ fibre ] are frames taken from a movie .",
    "[ gas_pocket ] shows the growth of the gas pocket shown in fig .",
    "[ fibre ] .",
    "the figure was constructed from the same movie of the bubbling process used for fig .",
    "[ fibre ] .",
    "two hundred frames , corresponding to @xmath18 were extracted from the movie and rotated so that the fibre shown in fig .",
    "[ fibre ] was vertical . from each frame the same column of pixels , passing through the centre of the fibre , was extracted and those columns placed side by side to construct a new figure : fig .  [ gas_pocket ] .",
    "this figure shows the evolution of the gas pocket : its slow growth ( as predicted by the model ) and then its rapid loss of gas to form an external bubble ( as assumed by the model ) .",
    "the model developed above allows us to investigate the feasibility of an alternative foaming strategy for stout beers in cans and bottles in which a coating of hydrophobic fibres on the inside of the can is used to promote foaming .",
    "a typical pouring time for a stout beer is @xmath19 . in this time about @xmath20 postcritical nuclei must be released .",
    "a single fibre produces one bubble every @xmath21 .",
    "therefore about @xmath22 fibres are needed .",
    "if each fibre occupies a surface of area @xmath23 then the total area that must be occupied by fibres is @xmath24 equivalent to a square with edge length @xmath25 .",
    "this indicates that such an approach may be possible .",
    "a model of bubble formation in carbonated liquids has been extended to the case of liquids containing both dissolved nitrogen and carbon dioxide . taking values typical of stout beers",
    "shows that bubble formation by this mechanism does occur but at a substantially slower rate .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that widgets are needed to promote foaming in canned stouts .",
    "the possibility of replacing widgets with an array of hollow fibre nucleation sites was investigated and shown to be potentially feasible .",
