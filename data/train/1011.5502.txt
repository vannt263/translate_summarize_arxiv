    "energetic feedback processes that drive gas out of galaxies are believed to be the most important way in which the igm is polluted by metals , as suggested by both observational ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) studies .    in spite of the observational evidence that metals have polluted the high - redshift igm , several issues remain unclear .",
    "what fraction of the volume of the igm , and hence of the universe , is polluted by metals ?",
    "out to what distance do galaxies need to enrich the gas around them in order to reproduce observations ? can observed galaxies do the job or are fainter galaxies the main culprit ?    the metal distribution in the high - redshift igm has been investigated by many authors using self - consistent , hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of these simulation results is , however , complicated by their complex nature and by the crudeness of , and freedom provided by , the required subgrid models .",
    "in addition , their computational expense prohibits comprehensive explorations of parameter space .",
    "observationally , @xcite use four quasar spectra along with a suite of synthetic quasar spectra and find that the lower limit for the volume filling factor of is @xmath11 .",
    "simple models therefore represent a useful complement to full - blown simulation studies . to this end",
    "various authors have employed models in which the igm is enriched by spherical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) bubbles of metals placed around haloes to investigate the metal distribution in the universe .",
    "models in which the gas is enriched down to varying densities have been used to constrain the volume filling factor of enriched gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , as discussed by e.g.  @xcite , the inferred filling factors could be misleading if the metals are poorly mixed , as obervations suggest to be the case on both large @xcite and small scales @xcite .    in the present work we combine toy models for the metal distribution with a large , cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to investigate what halo masses could host the sources of the observed intergalactic metals , out to",
    "what distances the galaxies need to enrich the gas , and what ( large - scale ) volume filling factor of heavy elements is required in order to reproduce the observed metal distribution as probed through absorption lines in the spectra of quasars .",
    "in particular , we compare model predictions to the observed @xmath0 relation between the median optical depth of @xmath3 as a function of the @xmath1 optical depth @xcite .",
    "we choose to restrict our analysis to the median optical depth because it allows us to compare with published results and because it provides a simple measure of how far away from galaxies the igm is being enriched .",
    "we achieve this by extracting synthetic absorption spectra after imposing simple metal distributions in which all haloes above a given mass cut are allowed to enrich the igm spherically out to a fixed radius .",
    "this allows us to link a metal distribution with a well - defined mass and volume filling factor , via cosmological gas density and temperature distributions , to the observations and so to determine which of the possible metal distributions are capable of reproducing the observations .",
    "we will show that the igm must have been primarily enriched by galaxies that reside in low - mass ( @xmath12 ) haloes and are capable of driving gas out to distances @xmath13kpc . assuming the metals to be well mixed on small scales , the fractions of the volume and baryonic mass that are polluted with metals are , respectively , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in all models that are capable of matching the observations .",

    "the simulation analysed in this study is one of the cosmological , hydrodynamical simulations that comprise the overwhelmingly large simulations ( owls ) project and is described in detail in @xcite .",

    "this physical model is denoted as the _ ref _ model in @xcite , and is used in all of the simulations analysed in this paper .    for the purposes of this work , our prescriptions for radiative cooling and reionization are the most important aspects of the model , as the thermal state of the igm depends on them . in brief , we calculate radiative cooling and heating using the tables of @xcite , which contain net cooling rates ( calculated using the code cloudy , last described in * ? ? ?",

    "the simulations from which we derive the bulk of our results are _",
    "l025n512 _ and _ l012n512_. two additional simulations , _ l025n256 _ and _ l012n256 _ , are used to independently assess the effects of simulation box size and numerical resolution .",
    "although each of the simulations was run to @xmath22 we restrict our analysis to the @xmath0 simulation snapshots , approximately corresponding to the median redshift of the observational sample that we compare to .",
    "our analysis depends on the identification of the masses and locations of gravitationally bound dark matter haloes , which are identified using the spherical overdensity criterion implemented in the subfind algorithm @xcite .",
    "halo properties quoted in this paper are defined with respect to spheres with radius @xmath23 and mass @xmath24 , centred on the potential minimum of each identified halo , defined so that they contain a mean internal density equal to 200 times the critical density of the universe at the redshift we are considering .",
    "we note that although we will present results only for the reference implementation of the subgrid physics modules , we have repeated the analysis for a range of physics implementations .",
    "this is important because the different physics prescriptions can affect the density , temperature and velocity fields of the absorbing gas , changing the predicted ion abundances and optical depths .",
    "we find , however , that using either a simulation with strong , agn feedback ( _ agn_l025n512 _ in the owls nomenclature ) , or a simulation that neglects both supernova feedback and cooling through metal lines ( _ nosn_nozcool_l025n512 _ in the owls nomenclature ) has a negligible effect on our results or conclusions .      in order to predict a synthetic @xmath25 relation ,",
    "we require knowledge of both the distribution of metals and the physical state of the absorbing gas . in the simulation , gas metallicities",
    "are tracked self - consistently , but in the present study we do not make use of this information .",
    "we instead assume that all haloes with a total mass greater than @xmath26 are able to enrich the surrounding gas out to a proper distance @xmath27 to a metallicity @xmath28 , and that outside of these spheres the metallicity of the igm is zero .",
    "our model for the intergalactic metal distribution is therefore completely specified by three parameters : @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . as we will see ,",
    "the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath26 determine the shape of the relation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which is the primary focus of this paper .",
    "the metallicity changes only the normalisation , with @xmath31 , so we simply scale @xmath28 in each run to match the normalisation of the observed @xmath25 relation at @xmath32 , the largest optical depth probed by the observations .    at this point",
    "we must note one caveat : we have imposed metal distributions on to already completed simulations , the models are not fully self - consistent in that they do not include the effect of the winds that carry the metals on the density and temperature structure of the gas and in that they do not include the effect of the metals on the cooling rates .",
    "the last point is , however , not a major concern as we will show that the metallicities required to match the observations are sufficiently low ( typically @xmath33 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : od ] ) , that metals do not significantly change the gas cooling rates ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while the hydrodynamical simulations that underlie our models did include winds , these winds fall short of being able to account for the observed @xmath3 at low @xmath4 , as we will show elsewhere .",
    "this failure is actually consistent with our results .",
    "although the simulations have sufficient resolution to identify dark matter haloes to very low masses ( corresponding to @xmath34 dark matter particles ) , their finite resolution does cause us to strongly underestimate the star formation rates in most of the low - mass haloes that we can identify .",
    "hence , the simulations underestimate the number and strength of the outflows originating from the low - mass haloes that we claim to be responsible for the enrichment of the igm . because not all of the gas that is enriched in our models was touched by winds in the underlying hydro simulation",
    ", we can not exclude the possibility that a self - consistent simulation giving rise to a similar distribution of bubbles would predict the enriched gas to be too hot to be visible in @xmath3 .",
    "reassuringly , we find , as noted above , that post - processing simulations without winds or with much stronger winds leads to identical conclusions .",
    "we note that we expect the heating effect of outflows from low - mass galaxies to be smaller than those from the more massive galaxies that our simulations do include .",
    "this is because there are already many low - mass galaxies at high redshift , giving the gas more time to cool , and because they are observed to drive winds of velocities @xmath35km / s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( this velocity corresponds to post - shock temperatures of @xmath36k , assuming the gas is fully ionized and of primordial composition ) , which leaves the post - shock gas at temperatures for which the cooling time is much shorter than the age of the universe @xcite .    the conclusions based on our simple models will , however , ultimately need to be confirmed by self - consistent , hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "unfortunately , at the moment such simulations rely on uncertain subgrid models for the generation of winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and they lack the resolution required to model outflows from low - mass galaxies and to simulate the small - scale mixing relevant for the observations @xcite .    the bulk of our results are derived from a grid of models in which @xmath26 is varied in steps of 0.5  dex from the lowest mass haloes that can be robustly identified in the highest resolution simulation , @xmath37 , which are the least massive haloes that are expected to be able to produce stars after reionization @xcite , up to @xmath38 .",
    "note that a mass of @xmath39 is small compared with the total masses inferred for observed galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xcite find that lyman - break galaxies reside in haloes of mass @xmath40 .",
    "however , as we will show , such high - mass galaxies are unimportant for the enrichment of the igm .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is changed in factors of 2 from @xmath41  kpc to 500  kpc .",
    "in addition , we investigate a set of runs in which haloes in the fiducial simulation are allowed to enrich the igm out to a fixed multiple of their virial radius , @xmath23 .",
    "galactic winds with velocities up to 400 - 600  km / s are frequently detected in starburst galaxies through the gas absorption lines that are blue - shifted relative to their host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume that winds were ejected from galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath42 ) and that their velocities do not decrease with time , then by @xmath0 galaxies can enrich out to a maximum radius of @xmath43  proper mpc .",
    "the assumption of a constant , high outflow velocity and launch at @xmath44 make this estimate far too optimistic , but all of the models that match the observations require @xmath27 to be no larger than @xmath45  kpc ( which is likely still too optimistic ; see e.g.  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , and are thus compatible with constraints placed on the metal distribution by travel - time arguments .",
    "optical depth distributions are calculated by firing @xmath46 randomly chosen lines of sight through the simulation volume and calculating absorption spectra for both @xmath1 and @xmath3 following the procedure outlined in e.g. appendix  a4 of @xcite .",
    "the mean @xmath1 optical depth in our simulations at @xmath0 is @xmath47 , which is consistent with observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to match observations with hires on the keck telescope , we convolve our spectra with a gaussian line - spread function with a full - width - at - half - maximum of 6.6 km / s , and resample our spectra onto 1 km / s pixels .",
    "we do not add noise to our spectra , but we have verified that the addition of gaussian noise with a signal - to - noise ratio of greater than 25 does not significantly affect any of our results .",
    "we generate absorption spectra for two transitions : @xmath1 ( 1215.67 ) and the @xmath3 doublet ( 1548.20 , 1550.78 ) . in order to compare to the observed @xmath25 distribution , we then bin pixels in @xmath30 and calculate the median @xmath29 corresponding to the redshifts of the pixels in each @xmath1 bin .",
    "for each run , in addition to measuring the @xmath25 relation , we calculate the fraction of the total mass ( @xmath48 ) and volume ( @xmath49 ) that has been enriched from @xmath50 here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the sph particle mass and smoothing kernel , respectively , and the sums in the numerator of each fraction extend only over particles with non - zero metallicity .",
    "we have verified that using @xmath53 instead of @xmath54 gives nearly identical volume filling fractions , as expected . for the solar abundance we use the metal mass fraction @xmath55 .",

    "the fractions of the mass and volume that are enriched do not track each other in a simple way .",

    "changing @xmath27 from 31.25kpc to 500kpc changes the ratio @xmath57 from 22.7 to 1.3 , as a larger value of @xmath27 at fixed @xmath26 allows metals to disperse further out of the high - density peaks .",
    "similarly , changing @xmath26 at fixed @xmath60  kpc , we find that the ratio @xmath57 rises from 2.8 for @xmath61 to 7.5 for @xmath38 , because more massive haloes are preferentially located in higher density environments .",
    "given that we understand how changing the pattern of metal enrichment alters the relative mass and volume filling factors , we now ask how this impacts the @xmath25 relation .    the curves in fig .",

    "was chosen such that the @xmath66  kpc curve exactly matches the observations at the highest value of @xmath30 and the metallicity required for this normalisation is given in each panel .    in the present work we are not aiming to reproduce the shape of the @xmath25 relation in detail and , indeed ,",
    "would not necessarily expect our simple models to be capable of doing this .",
    "rather , we require that the models predict a median @xmath25 relation that is consistent with , or larger , than observed and that the @xmath25 relation is not steeper than observed .",
    "we effectively combine the two conditions by scaling @xmath28 in each run to match the normalisation of the observed @xmath25 relation at @xmath67 , the largest optical depth probed by the observations , and then requiring the model to predict median @xmath29 at low @xmath30 that are consistent with or greater than observed .    we stress that overprediction of @xmath29 is not a problem at small @xmath30 because our simple models make the assumption that the metallicity inside each enriched bubble is constant with radius .",
    "the overestimate at low @xmath29 could therefore be solved by imposing a metallicity that decreases with radius . on the other hand",
    ", we will assume that underprediction of @xmath29 at low @xmath30 signals the failure of the model because a metallicity that increases with radius is likely unphysical .",
    "such an unphysical metallicity gradient would also have been required if we had chosen to scale the metallicity to match the low @xmath30 points , because the unsuccessful , constant metallicity models predict much steeper @xmath25 relations than observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : od ] ) .",
    "in fact , such an approach would not be possible for most of the models that we rule out , because they typically predict the median @xmath29 to be zero at low @xmath30 .    in principle",
    ", we could produce significantly better fits to the @xmath25 relation by considering more complex models ( e.g.  including metallicity gradients , anisotropic outflows or scatter in metallicities ) , but that is not the aim of the present study .",
    "given that such models would still not be self - consistent if the enrichment is done in post - processing , it is not obvious that the use of more complex models would be justified .    before proceeding ,",
    "we evaluate the effect of our simulation s finite box size and numerical resolution on our results .",
    "firstly , the dotted curves in panels _ b _ , _ c _ and _ d _ show the effect of decreasing the box size by a factor of two in each dimension , while keeping the numerical resolution fixed ( _ l012n256 _ vs. _ l025n512 _ ) .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath68 our results are converged with respect to box size , but that for @xmath69 the 12.5mpc/@xmath56 and 25mpc/@xmath56 volumes predict significantly different @xmath25 relations , indicating that for haloes of this mass the simulation results from the 25mpc/@xmath56 volume are not necessarily converged .",
    "note , however , that allowing only haloes with masses @xmath70 to enrich the igm yields @xmath25 relations that are far steeper than those allowed by the observations .",
    "we thus conclude that our simulation boxes are sufficiently large for our purposes .",
    "secondly , the long - dashed curves in panels _ c _ and _ d _ show the effect of degrading the simulation mass resolution by a factor of eight while keeping the box size constant ( _ l025n256 _ vs. _ l025n512 _ ) . decreasing",
    "the resolution does not significantly change any of the conclusions derived from this analysis .",
    "considering first the case where only haloes with mass @xmath71 enrich the igm , we find that even if such objects were able to enrich out to a radius of @xmath45  kpc , they would fall far short of being able to account for the observed @xmath29 at @xmath72 because there are too few of them to enrich enough of the low - density gas .",
    "if we now consider a lower value of @xmath61 , the lower clustering strength and higher number density of these less massive haloes allows them to pollute lower density gas , even if they enrich out to much smaller distances .",

    "we can estimate the maximum allowed mass of carbon in the igm from the stellar mass density at @xmath0 . under the assumption that all of the stars formed in a single burst at @xmath87 , and assuming a chabrier stellar initial mass function and using the lifetimes , yields and supernova rates used in the simulation and summarised in @xcite , the maximum allowed cosmic density of carbon is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the cosmic density in stars and has been measured to be @xmath90 @xcite at @xmath0 , giving us a maximum allowed total density in carbon of @xmath91 . for the models that can successfully reproduce the observed optical depth distributions , the cosmic density of carbon varies from @xmath92 ( @xmath59 ; @xmath93 ) to @xmath94 ( @xmath61 ; @xmath95 ) . in each case",
    "the total amount of carbon is an order of magnitude below the maximum allowed amount , so the models are physically reasonable on these grounds .",
    "we thus conclude that in order to recover the observed median @xmath3 optical depth in regions of low @xmath1 optical depth ( @xmath96 ) , we require that the galaxies in low - mass haloes ( @xmath97 ) enrich the igm out to distances @xmath98kpc .",
    "galaxies residing in much higher mass haloes ( @xmath99 ) are too rare and too strongly clustered to contribute significantly to the enrichment of the low - density igm . in every one of the models that is capable of reproducing the observations ,",
    "the metal volume filling factor is @xmath7 and the gas mass fraction enriched with metals is @xmath8 .    as discussed in detail in section  [ sec : metals ] , our models are not fully self - consistent in the sense that we have imposed metal distribution is post - processing .",
    "although we found that post - processing hydro simulations without winds or with very strong winds led to identical conclusions , we can not rule out the possitibity that future self - consistent models would yield different results .",
    "unfortunately , current simulations suffer from large uncertainties due to their use of subgrid recipes for the generation of winds and still lack the resolution to resolve outflows from low - mass galaxies in a representative volume .",
    "two additional caveats must , however , be stressed .",
    "firstly , the models presented here implicitly assume that the metals are well mixed on small scales .",
    "if , as suggested by observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , the intergalactic metals are concentrated in metal - rich patches which together account for large covering factors , then the required filling factors could be smaller . in that case",
    "the filling factors derived here apply to the metal distribution smoothed over the scales that are somewhat smaller than the size of the bubbles , i.e.  tens of kpc .",
    "secondly , there exists considerable uncertainty in the spectral shape of the ionizing background , which leads to uncertainties the fraction of carbon that exists as @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite considered several models for the uv background , including some extreme ones , and found that only the fiducial @xcite model , which is the model used here , resulted in reasonable values for the relative abundances inferred from observations .",
    "@xcite found that assuming a much harder ( softer ) spectrum would flatten ( steepen ) the metallicity - density relation inferred from the observed @xmath29-@xmath30 relation , which implies that our models would predict steeper ( flatter ) @xmath29-@xmath30 relations than for our standard uv background , which would increase ( decrease ) the inferred filling factors .",
    "our finding that the observations imply that the igm was enriched by very low - mass galaxies is in agreement with a variety of theoretical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , by modelling the propagation of galactic winds in already completed simulations , @xcite found that in order to explain the metallicities measured in the low column density part of the igm , galaxies with baryonic masses @xmath100 needed to launch winds with velocities of at least @xmath101  km / s .",
    "the results presented here are also consistent with @xcite , who used fully self - consistent hydrodynamical simulations ( including the simulations underlying our models ) that massive haloes ( @xmath102 ) are unimportant for the enrichment of the diffuse igm and that most of the metals that reside in the igm at @xmath103 were ejected by a population of low - mass galaxies at high redshift .    in contrast",
    ", @xcite found that in order to match the strong clustering of @xmath3 lines that they measured in their observations , the absorption needed to be generated primarily by gas that is strongly clustered around massive galaxies .",
    "their best fit model required @xmath69 and @xmath95 . using these parameters in our model",
    "leads to such low volume ( @xmath104 ) and mass ( @xmath105 ) filling factors that the corresponding curves would not appear on any of the plots presented here .",
    "we plan to explore the apparent tension between line clustering and optical depth statistics in future work .    in summary",
    ", we have found that in order for a simulated cosmological gas density field to reproduce the observed @xmath25 relation , we require that both the fractions of the volume and mass of the igm that have been polluted with metals are substantial , with all our successful parameter choices yielding model volume filling factors greater than 10% and model mass filling factors greater than 50% .",
    "the models favour metals being ejected from a population of low - mass ( @xmath5 ) haloes at high redshift .",
    "the authors would like to thank all the members of the owls team for useful discussions ; anthony aguirre , ben oppenheimer , and olivera rakic for a careful reading of the manuscript ; and rob wiersma for both a reading of the manuscript and help with the calculation of stellar yields .",
    "we are also grateful to the anonymous referee for a constructive report .",
    "the simulations employed in this study were run on stella , the lofar bluegene / l system in groningen and on the cosmology machine at the institute for computational cosmology in durham as part of the virgo consortium research programme .",
