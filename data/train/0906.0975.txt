    "they show common features in the 800 - 2000 @xmath1 region : the g and d peaks , around 1580 and 1350 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the g peak corresponds to the @xmath2 phonon at the brillouin zone center ( @xmath3  point ) .",

    "the 2d peak is the second order of the d peak . since both 2d and 2d originate from a process where momentum conservation is satisfied by two phonons with opposite wavevectors ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , they do not require the presence of defects for their activation , and are thus always present .",
    "indeed , high quality graphene shows the g , 2d and 2d peaks , but not d and d@xcite .",
    "also , under the assumption of electron - hole symmetry , the two - phonon peaks are fully resonant@xcite .",
    "this means that energy and momentum conservation are satisfied in all elementary steps of the raman process , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : res](c , e ) . then , all intermediate electronic states are real . as a consequence ,",
    "two - phonon raman spectroscopy is sensitive to the dynamics of the photo - excited electron - hole pair , in particular , to the scattering processes it can undergo .",
    "this is of crucial importance for the present work .",
    "the effects of doping on the graphene g - peak position [ pos(g ) ] and full width at half maximum [ fwhm(g ) ] were reported in refs . .",
    "pos(g ) increases and fwhm(g ) decreases for both electron and hole doping .",
    "the g peak stiffening is due to the non - adiabatic removal of the kohn - anomaly at @xmath15@xcite . the fwhm(g",
    ") sharpening is due to pauli blocking of phonon decay into electron - hole pairs , when the electron - hole gap is higher than the phonon energy@xcite , and saturates for a fermi shift bigger than half phonon energy@xcite .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for the lo - g@xmath16 peak in metallic nanotubes@xcite , for the same reasons . in the case of blg ,",
    "the different band structure re - normalizes the phonon response to doping differently from slg@xcite .",
    "also in this case the raman g peak stiffens and sharpens for both electron and hole doping , as a result of the non - adiabatic kohn anomaly at @xmath3@xcite .",
    "however , since blg has two conduction and valence subbands , with splitting dependent on the interlayer coupling , this changes the slope in the variation of pos(g ) with doping , allowing a direct measurement of the interlayer coupling strength@xcite .",
    "another significant result is that in slg the ratio of the heights of the 2d and g peaks , i(2d)/i(g ) , and their areas , a(2d)/a(g ) , is maximum for zero doping@xcite , and decreases for increasing doping . on the other hand",
    ", this shows little dependence on doping for blg@xcite .",
    "[ figdata ] plots the combined data for slg and blg from refs .  .",
    "note that refs .   reported height ratios , while here , as discussed later , we analyze the area ratio a(2d)/a(g ) , which encompasses both trends of i(2d)/i(g ) and fwhm(2d)/fwhm(g ) .    due to residual disorder",
    ", the energy of the dirac point can fluctuate across the sample on a scale smaller than the laser spot , which leads to spatial inhomogeneity of the doping level@xcite .",
    "we attribute the difference in the behavior of the two slg curves in fig.2 to a different degree of residual charge inhomogeneity in the polymeric electrolyte experiments of refs .  .",
    "on the other hand , the use of this electrolyte enabled probing a very large doping range , because the nanometer - thick debye layer gives a much higher gate capacitance compared to the usual 300 nm sio@xmath17 back gate  @xcite .",
    "note as well that a(2d)/a(g ) for the most intrinsic samples measured to date is @xmath181217  @xcite , much higher than the zero gating values in refs .",
    ", as shown in fig .",
    "this points again to sources of disorder in the gated samples of refs .  , while the absence of a significant d peak excludes large amounts of structural defects .    here",
    ", we show that the 2d intensity doping dependence results from its sensitivity to the scattering of the photoexcited electron and hole . assuming the dominant sources of scattering to be phonon emission and electron - electron collisions , we note that , while the former is not sensitive to doping , the latter is .",
    "then , the 2d doping dependence can be used to estimate the corresponding electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) .     for slg@xcite and blg@xcite .",
    "the blg data ( solid squares ) are divided by 10 , to make comparison easier .",

    "raman scattering@xcite is an electron - mediated process where electromagnetic radiation exchanges vibrational quanta ( phonons ) with a crystal .",
    "a complete description requires the detailed knowledge of ( i ) electronic structure , ( ii ) phonon dispersions , ( iii ) mutual interactions between electrons and phonons ( i.e. electron - electron , electron - phonon and phonon - phonon scattering ) .",
    "the raman spectrum of graphene consists of a set of distinct peaks .",
    "each characterized by its position width , height , and area .",
    "the frequency - integrated area under each peak represents the probability of the whole process .",
    "it is more robust with respect to various perturbations of the phonon states than width and height .",
    "indeed , for an ideal case of dispersionless undamped phonons with frequency @xmath19 the shape of the @xmath20-phonon peak is a dirac @xmath21 distribution @xmath22 , with zero width , infinite height , but well - defined area .",
    "if the phonons decay ( e.  g , into other phonons , due to anharmonicity , or into electron - hole pairs , due to electron - phonon coupling ) , the @xmath21 lineshape broadens into a lorentzian , but the area is preserved , as the total number of phonon states can not be changed by such perturbations . if phonons have a weak dispersion , states with different momenta contribute at slightly different frequencies .",
    "this may result in an overall shift and a non - trivial peak shape , but frequency integration across the peak means counting all phonon states , as in the dispersionless case .",
    "thus , the peak area is preserved , as long as the raman matrix element itself is not changed significantly by the perturbation .",
    "the latter holds when the perturbation ( phonon broadening or dispersion ) is smaller than the typical energy scale determining the matrix element . converting this into a time scale using the uncertainty principle we have that , if the raman process is faster than the phonon decay , the total number of photons emitted within a given peak ( i.  e. , integrated over frequency across the peak ) , is not affected by phonon decay , although their spectral distribution can be .",
    "although the graphene phonons giving rise to the d and d peak are dispersive due to the kohn anomalies at @xmath5 and @xmath15 @xcite , their relative change with respect to the average phonon energy is at most a few % , thus we are in the weakly dispersive case discussed above .",
    "the phonon decay in graphene is in the picosecond timescale , while the raman process is faster , in the femtosecond timescale@xcite .",
    "then , we will analyze the area ratio , a(2d)/a(g ) , which encompasses both variations in height ratio , i(2d)/i(g ) , and width : fwhm(2d)/fwhm(g ) .",
    "we first consider the g peak .",
    "for the one - phonon process , allowed by momentum conservation , which gives rise to the g peak , the picture is entirely different from the two - phonon case .",
    "as shown in fig.1a , the process responsible for the g peak is determined by virtual electron - hole pairs with energy @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the laser excitation energy ( for a typical visible raman measurement @xmath25 ) . if the fermi energy , @xmath26 , stays below @xmath23 , as in refs .",
    ", these electronic states are not strongly affected .",
    "only the final phonon state is influenced by doping , which manifests itself in a change of pos(g ) and fwhm(g)@xcite .",
    "however , the area of the peak is determined by the total spectral weight of the phonon state , which is preserved .",
    "thus , we do not expect any significant dependence of a(g ) on doping , as long as the doping is not too strong , so that @xmath27 .",
    "we can then take the measured doping dependence of a(2d)/a(g ) as representative of the a(2d ) trend .",
    "note that a(g ) can change as a function of other external parameters , such as the raman excitation energy@xcite .",
    "however , for fixed excitation , such as in the experiments discussed here , the above argument holds .    in ref .",
    "the following expressions for the 2d and 2d areas were obtained :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the electron charge , @xmath30  is the speed of light , @xmath31 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath32 is the electron velocity ( its experimental value is @xmath33@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath34  is the scattering rate of the photoexcited electron and hole .",
    "note that we define @xmath35  as the imaginary part of the energy , so it determines the decay of the amplitude , while the decay of the probability is determined by @xmath34 .",
    "this includes all sources of inelastic scattering .",
    "assuming the two main mechanisms for electron scattering to be the emission of phonons and electron - electron collisions , we write : @xmath36 here we include the phonons near @xmath3 and * k * , responsible for d and d. the corresponding emission rates , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , enter the numerators in eqs .",
    "( [ i2d= ] ) , ( [ i2dp= ] ) .",
    "two points regarding eqs .",
    "( [ i2d= ] ) , ( [ i2dp= ] ) should be emphasized .",
    "first , the scattering rates depend on the electron energy ,  @xmath39 , which is defined by half the laser energy , @xmath40 [ see eq .",
    "( [ gamma1= ] ) in the next section ] .",
    "second , if impurity scattering is significant compared to other scattering mechanisms , the corresponding elastic scattering rate can not be simply included in  @xmath35 and eqs .",
    "( [ i2d= ] ) , ( [ i2dp= ] ) . the whole raman intensity calculation should be done differently .",
    "( [ i2d= ] ) , ( [ i2dp= ] ) thus neglect impurity scattering . for short - range impurities this assumption is justified by the absence of a large d peak in the spectra of refs .  .",
    "long - range disorder is efficiently screened ( even though the vanishing density of states at the dirac point requires the screening to be nonlinear@xcite ) ; it is precisely this screening that gives rise to the inhomogeneous concentration of electrons / holes and spatial fluctuations of the dirac point energy .    in principle , there are no reasons for a strong dependence of  @xmath41 on carrier density .",
    "however , @xmath42 does exhibit such a dependence .",
    "indeed , in undoped graphene at low temperatures , the photoexcited electron finds itself in a state with some momentum , @xmath43 , measured from the dirac point , in the empty conduction band . to scatter into a state with a different momentum @xmath44",
    ", it has to give away some energy and momentum to another electron in the full valence band .",
    "this second electron would have to be promoted to the conduction band ( as there are no available empty states in the valence band ) into a state with momentum @xmath45 , leaving a hole in the valence band with  @xmath46 .",
    "momentum and energy conservation require :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the quasiparticle dispersion , assumed the same for electrons and holes .",
    "for dirac particles , @xmath49 , the only possibility to satisfy both conservation laws is to have all four momenta parallel .",
    "if the spectrum is convex , @xmath50 , the two equations can be satisfied by a set of momenta with non - zero measure , i.  e. the phase space is finite .",
    "if it is concave , @xmath51 , they are incompatible . in slg",
    "the spectrum is dirac to a first approximation , resulting in an uncertainty@xcite .",
    "this can be resolved by taking into account corrections from electron - electron interactions , which make the spectrum concave,@xcite and the interband process forbidden .",
    "as new carriers are added to the system , intraband electron - electron collisions become allowed .",
    "the momentum and energy conservation become : @xmath52 which can be satisfied for any quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "these collisions give a contribution to @xmath42 which increases with carrier concentration . as a consequence , the total  @xmath35 in eq.1a increases , leading to an overall decrease of a(2d ) , consistent with the experimental trend in fig .",
    "[ figdata ] .",
    "the above arguments essentially use the non - convexity of the electronic spectrum in the conduction band , and thus apply to slg only . in blg , the spectrum is parabolic near the dirac point , so that @xmath53 , and the phase - space restrictions are absent .",
    "thus , electron - electron collisions are allowed even at zero doping , and the collision rate has a much weaker dependence on @xmath26 , which , in first approximation , can be neglected .",
    "thus , a(2d ) is expected to have a weak dependence on  @xmath26 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figdata ] , where the experimental a(2d)/a(g ) for blg shows a negligible variation with doping@xcite .    to quantify the doping effects on the slg a(2d ) , we first calculate the electron - electron scattering rate , @xmath54 , in the random - phase approximation , analogously to refs .  .",

    "a(2d)/a(g ) for intrinsic samples measured at 514.5 nm excitation , the same used in refs . , is in the range 12 - 17@xcite , represented by the star in fig . 4 at 14.5 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the ratio measured for carbon whiskers@xcite .",
    "these show a 2d peak very similar to graphene , being composed of mis - oriented graphene layers@xcite",
    ". however , their raman spectra are much less susceptible to charged impurities or surface doping , being bulk materials@xcite .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath78 , which we use to eliminate the effect of doping inhomogeneity , by constraining @xmath79 at zero doping .",
    "we also need to consider the dielectric constant of the polymer electrolyte  @xcite , @xmath80 , giving @xmath81 .",
    "thus , we fit the data with a one - parameter expression : @xmath82 we fit separately each branch of the two data - sets , as shown by solid and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] .",

    "even though graphite and other @xmath85-hybridized materials have been investigated for more than 50 years@xcite , all the fundamental physical properties needed for the interpretation of the raman spectra have undergone an intense debate , which seems to be just beginning to converge .",
    "interestingly , several features of both phonon dispersions and band structure of graphene are determined by the epc .",
    "for example , in the kohn anomalies around @xmath3 or * * k**@xcite the correction to the phonon frequencies due to epc results in a linear slope of the optical phonon branches as the wave vector approaches @xmath3 or * k*. the epc and phonon dispersions calculations of ref .",
    "have been confirmed at the @xmath86 point by inelastic x - ray scattering@xcite , and by the measurement of fwhm(g ) in graphite , graphene and nanotubes@xcite , once an - harmonic effects are taken into account@xcite . for the * k * point , the precise slope of the anomaly",
    "is debated @xcite .",
    "another epc effect is the kink in the electron dispersion , @xmath18200  mev below @xmath26 , seen by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite . this is attributed to a correction to the electron energy due to epc@xcite , although alternative explanations also exist@xcite .",
    "thus , a correct epc determination is a fundamental step for an accurate description of the physical properties of graphene , and nanotubes , being rolled up graphene sheets .    to link the 2d intensity to the epc we first consider the rate of phonon emission by the photoexcited electron / hole , @xmath87",
    "this is obtained from the imaginary part of the electron self - energy , @xmath88 . for @xmath89 , as in the case of the raman measurements at 2.41 ev excitation of refs . , we have@xcite : @xmath90 then , from eq .",

    "since different epc definitions are used in the literature , it is quite useful to give here matching rules for all of them , which will be necessary when comparing the epc values obtained here with previous ( and future ) reports .",
    "the epcs can be conveniently matched by either relating them to the nearest - neighbor tight - binding model , where the constants are expressed in terms of a single parameter : @xmath104 , the derivative of the nearest - neighbor electronic matrix element with respect to the interatomic distance , or by comparing expressions for various observables .",

    "in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) experiment of ref .   was measured from the ratio of the electronic velocities below and above the kink in the electron dispersion .",
    "this ratio is determined by the derivative of the real part of the electronic self - energy @xmath118 due to the epc .",
    "the latter can be calculated if one takes the dirac spectrum for electrons and a constant dispersion for phonons . for @xmath119@xcite : @xmath120 here @xmath121 is the ultraviolet cutoff , of the order of the electronic bandwidth .",
