    "the underlying idea is that massive close - in exoplanets should be able to interact with their host star magnetically and/or tidally @xcite . however , because stellar activity effectively masks signals used to detect exoplanets , one has to be careful not to interpret intrinsic biases in samples of planet - hosting stars as a physical interaction effect @xcite .",
    "a useful way to test for activity enhancements caused by hot jupiters is to look at wide stellar binaries , in which only one star hosts a planet massive and close enough for strong tidal interaction .",
    "the star without a planet then acts as a negative control , because its activity evolution should be unperturbed by any planetary effects .",
    "one can thus test if both stars display magnetic activity levels appropriate for their common stellar age ( taking into account slight differences due to spectral type ) .",
    "we are conducting an observational program using x - ray data and optical spectra to test for such activity differences .",

    "the host star is an f star with a very thin outer convective envelope ( @xmath4  boo and @xmath5  and ) .",
    "we interpret our initial findings as a manifestation of tidal interaction between the planet and the host star .",
    "theoretical studies show that hot jupiters induce tidal bulges on the host star ; cool stars can dissipate the energy contained in the bulges much more effectively than hot stars due to turbulent eddies in the convective envelopes , see @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the hot jupiters in the hd  189733a and corot-2a systems may therefore have inhibited the spin - down of their host stars , by transferring angular momentum from the planetary orbit into the stellar spin .    to test this hypothesis further",
