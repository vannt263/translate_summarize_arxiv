    "winds are believed to play a key role in determining the equation of state of the intergalactic medium and the long - term evolution of galaxies , yet direct proof is elusive .",
    "wind energetics have proved very difficult to constrain because of uncertain gas filling factors in the different phases , but evidence is growing that they may be far larger than inferred from optical spectra of the shock or photoionized nebulae , and radio observations of supernovas and their remnants .",
    "winds can influence galaxy evolution in many ways @xcite .",
    "they are important redistributors of metals by radiation on dust or by over - pressured gas from supernova heating . in the galaxy ,",
    "enrichment of the halo and outer disk through powerful winds may account for the observed abundances of the thick disk and globular clusters @xcite .",
    "moreover , winds can regulate the growth of the central bulge @xcite , and alter the evolution of satellites of large galaxies , with either galaxy hosting the outflow ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example )",
    ". winds may mix astrated gas into intergalactic clouds @xcite , and may clear paths through dusty veils for agn / starbursts to reionize the universe .",
    "a superwind is driven by the pressure of thermalized supernova or agn ejecta .",
    "as the wind expands and cools adiabatically , it accelerates to several thousand km  s@xmath6 .",
    "expanding along the pressure gradient in the galaxy , the wind can over - run , crush , and heat disk and halo clouds to x - ray emitting temperatures , then entrain them into the flow .",
    "x - rays may also arise from stand - off bow shocks in the wind upstream of the optically emitting clouds . thus , soft x - rays may point to powerful shocks .",
    "however , they can also be emitted at the conductive interface between hot shocked wind and cooler ism swept up by a bubble .",
    "whether gas blows out of the galaxy depends on hydrodynamical details and halo drag @xcite .",
    "to understand this ubiquitous phenomenon , we are studying energetic outflows in nearby galaxies . here , increased spatial resolution of many ism phases may uncover evidence for previous outflows and energetic stellar populations , constraining the duty - cycle of ejection and illuminating the feedback role of fast and slow winds on supernovae @xcite .",
    "one of the clearest examples of a nearby superwind - blown structure is the prominent bubble @xcite that protrudes from the nucleus of the nearly edge - on sb(s)c galaxy ngc 3079 ( @xmath7 mpc , so 1  = 84 pc ) .",
    "rising 1.3 kpc ( 15 ) above the disk , the bubble is the optically emitting half of a double - lobed radio structure @xcite , optical line emission from the other lobe being extinguished by the galaxy disk .",
    "outflow kinetic energies of up to @xmath8 erg are implied by the optical line emission @xcite . because of considerable extinction , the nuclear power source is manifest primarily by reprocessed radiation .",
    "how the superbubble is powered is thus uncertain , with both agn @xcite and starburst @xcite sources promoted .",
    "the total energy required corresponds to the effects of 10@xmath9/@xmath10 supernovae , where @xmath10 is the thermalization efficiency @xcite .",
    "a particular obstacle to achieving realistic simulations of the wind is that even a rough estimate of @xmath10 is controversial @xcite : it can be @xmath11 in dense gas @xcite where the energy is radiated away , but can exceed 30% if the supernovae occur in multi - phase gas .    in ( * ?",

    "the h@xmath12[n ii]@xmath13 emission - line image shows many plausibly windblown features , including : 1 ) linear filaments rising several kpc above the disk to form an `` x '' that we have interpreted to be the contact discontinuity / ism shock between wind and galaxy `` thick disk''/halo gas , 2 ) four towers of intertwined filaments that together form the optical emitting walls of the superbubble and that all disperse at the same height above the disk .",

    "they used the _ rosat _ hri to image x - rays across the superbubble with integral 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosity @xmath14 erg s@xmath6 , and also used the _ rosat _ pspc to detect the softest x - rays out to 25 east of the nucleus and 6  west .",
    "no spectrum could be isolated from the superbubble because the hri was energy insensitive while the pspc lacked spatial resolution to connect optical and x - ray emitting filaments . now a _",
    "chandra _ x - ray image is available , and the striking correspondence it reveals and the implications on soft x - ray emission from superwind bubbles are the subjects of this paper . in ",
    "2 we introduce the x - ray image , and analyze it in  3 . in ",
    "4 we discuss the dynamics , and summarize in  5 .",
    "we analyzed the archived 26.9 ksec exposure ( p.i .",
    "d. strickland ) obtained with the acis - s3 detector on the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ; the other acis - s chips miss the galaxy so are not discussed in this letter .",
    "we extracted a 2  square region centered on the superbubble ( the aim point of the observation ) ; well exposed point sources are round in this region , confirming the excellent spacecraft aspect solution .",
    "a few background `` flares '' were removed by using the _ ciao2.2.1 _ * lightcurve * task , reducing the effective exposure to 26.0 ksec .",
    "we formed several images with different smoothing , using constant and adaptive kernel sizes .",
    "for study of the nucleus and superbubble we obtained best results using a fixed kernel of 08 fwhm .",

    "1757 x - ray events were detected within a 27@xmath1622  ellipse centered on the superbubble ( fig .",
    "[ fig0]b ) and excluding a @xmath17 ellipse that spans the nucleus and jet and that emitted 309 events ( fig .",
    "[ fig0]a ) .",
    "we used the _ sherpa _ package within the _ ciao 2.2.1 _ software to quantify the spectra and to integrate fluxes .",
    "we fit the spectrum of the bubble with single temperature , collisional - ionization - equilibrium models such as ` mekal ` and external photoelectric absorption , allowing neutral absorption , gas temperature , and interpolated gas abundances to vary over the fitting energy interval @xmath18 kev ; abundances relative to he were fixed to the @xcite ratios . for the nucleus+jet spectrum , we also included a single gaussian at the fe emission .",
    "fit results , including derived x - ray fluxes and luminosities , are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we find that iron and @xmath5-element abundances are @xmath19 solar across the bubble ( @xmath20 times larger than @xcite derived for the diffuse halo of ngc 253 ) , and about half solar near the nucleus .",
    "the lack of independent constraints on element abundances from optical spectra added uncertainty on the fitted emission `` integral '' @xmath21 , where @xmath4 is the x - ray volume filling factor .",
    "it is possible that depletion onto dust explains the low iron abundances in both regions , but this would not explain depleted @xmath5-elements if confirmed by deeper spectra .",
    "calibration uncertainties ( see  2.1.4 in @xcite , notably the effective area of chip s3 is uncertain below 0.5 kev ) and low counts from both regions limited possibilities for detailed spectral analysis ; in particular , the necessary spectral binning evident in fig .  [ fig0 ] prevented us from using the intensity ratios of successive oxygen ionization states ( vii / viii ) to check the overall temperature solution hence the questionably low fitting abundance of the bubble .",
    "low counts also prohibited multi - temperature models .",
    "we did not explore the addition of a non - thermal component to increase gas abundances in the thermal gas although this is clearly plausible physically not only near the nucleus ( where it might be the agn ) , but also in the superbubble ( where it might be synchrotron emission from cosmic rays accelerated locally in shocks ) .",
    "we now discuss the x - ray emission , proceeding from smallest to largest scale .",
    "we do not discuss the considerable number of x - ray sources evident in the galaxy disk beyond 20  radius .",
    "the nucleus is obscured optically but prominent to _ chandra_. x - ray flux is elongated along the axis of the radio jet (  3.2 ) .",
    "the nominal registration puts the nucleus 04 south - west of the x - ray flux centroid , of order our registration uncertainty .",
    "indeed our spectral model shows that flux near the nucleus is absorbed @xmath22 more than @xcite estimated from the combined _",

    "[ fig0]a shows relatively strong fe k@xmath5 near 6 kev , providing unambiguous evidence for the agn that generally excites this line by fluorescence of the cold molecular gas evident nearby @xcite .",
    "sparse counts in the adjacent `` continuum '' prevented us from establishing the equivalent width of this line to compare to its strength in other agn .",
    "there is no evidence in the spectrum for a hard - component due either to the agn or to unrelated hard - spectrum x - ray binaries down to a count rate of 0.004 per second integrated over the interval @xmath23 kev .",

    "[ fig1]c show _ anticorrelated _ x - ray and high - velocity optical line filaments associated with the vlbi - scale jet ( cbvf ) .",
    "the main optical filament ( top one in panel a ) is displaced from an x - ray source ( top oval in the top panel a ) that does not show the hard spectrum of an unrelated x - ray binary down to the aforementioned count rate .",
    "the x - rays are likely not inverse compton scattered because there is no strong ir emission or collimated radio flux along this axis at the scale of the h@xmath5/x - ray emission .",
    "instead , the thermal spectrum that we infer with @xmath24 kev is consistent with that expected for a jet cocoon shock with average expansion or entrainment velocity @xmath25 km  s@xmath26 , where @xmath27 km  s@xmath26 , and @xmath28 is the concentration of all particles relative to hydrogen nuclei when the preshock medium is fully ionized and has 10% helium abundance by number @xcite .",

    "if of similar surface brightness to the eastern bubble , they are attenuated about threefold in count rate by absorption in the galaxy , so are too faint for meaningful spectral analysis .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that diffuse x - ray emission surrounds the nucleus out to 25  radius .",
    "emission is more extensive east of the nucleus , the disk nearside , than to the west .",
    "x - rays fill a cone with opening angle @xmath190@xmath63 as height increases above the disk , and are more concentrated on the south side of the nucleus where the cone edge coincides with inclined linear h@xmath0 filaments .",
    "x - ray emission on the north side of the nucleus is patchier , but may also be bounded in the cone sketched in fig .",
    "the cone apex is not at the galaxy nucleus .",
    "instead , the cone reaches the disk while still open , then becomes `` two horned '' west of the nucleus as x - rays trace the radio counterbubble ( discussed previously ) .",
    "again , x - ray emission is too faint for meaningful spectral constraints .",
    "we have not analyzed the statistical significance of other x - ray point sources .",
    "however , one of the registration sources in both wavebands is a small galaxy in the _ hst _ i - band image 32  east of the nucleus ( source `` a '' in fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "an arc of 4 sources , each about half the x - ray brightness of this galaxy but among the brighter `` background '' sources , lies @xmath6420  south and may form the eastern extension of the southern edge of the x - ray cone .",
    "it curves toward the cone axis as height increases from 30 to 40 .",
    "proceeding inward from the largest scale , the region of diffuse x - ray emission is bounded by the optically emitting x - pattern of filaments , which cbvf showed have the shape expected @xcite for the contact discontinuity / ism shock associated with lateral stagnation of the superwind in the galaxy `` thick disk''/halo ; the x - ray emission is not significantly edge brightened , suggesting a partially filled volume of warm gas within the shocked wind , not a shell of conductively heated gas .",
    "cbvf s models appropriate for steady - state wind flow , and reproduced as dotted and dashed white lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , remain open at the top .",
    "however , @xcite have modeled an adiabatic `` bipolar hypershell '' that arises from a point , impulsive energy release on a timescale much shorter than the several myr expansion time of the superbubble . these structures close at the top .",
    "the appearance of their models is sensitive to the density distributions of disk , halo , and the density of the extragalactic medium , but resemble one another for roughly the first 10 myrs .",
    "the outer shell expands at 200  300 km  s@xmath6 to shock - heat gas to 0.2 kev ( so would be very `` soft '' in a `` hardness '' map derived from a deeper _ chandra _ exposure ) , consistent with the velocities in our fabry - perot spectra @xcite .",
    "of course , identical shock envelopes arise for constant values of @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the energy of the explosive event and @xmath67 the ambient gas density .",
    "@xcite considered this model to interpret their _ chandra _ image of the starburst galaxy ngc 253 , rejecting it for one that describes optical emission from a wind - blown shell @xcite , the model that @xcite have applied to ngc 3079 .",
    "@xcite compared their models to ptv s pspc image of ngc 3079 , noting double - horned features on both sides of the galaxy at radii of @xmath1100 .",
    "this is much larger than the scale we are discussing , suggesting either that there have been several outbursts over the last 100 myrs or that the larger scale double - horns seen by the _ rosat _",
    "pspc are actually spurious overlaps of unrelated background objects .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : towers ] , what powers the superbubble remains ambiguous despite detection of fe line emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "as emphasized by @xcite , it is extremely difficult to distinguish the action of a starburst from an agn based solely on the ionizing flux .",
    "deeper images with _",
    "chandra _ and especially _ xmm / newton _ could establish if the contact discontinuity / ism shock closes to form symmetric bubbles .",
    "open morphology would argue for a steady wind rather than impulsive starburst , supporting the interpretation of @xcite that in the companion galaxy ngc 3073 , 10  west , trails away from ngc 3079 because of what would have to be an extremely energetic wind .",
    "a steady wind would favor an agn power source , because repetitive starbursts would make numerous , less massive stars that are not evident ( cf .  those in m82 , * ? ? ?",
    "the organization of both filament systems into vertical towers attached to the galaxy disk excludes the possibility that the optical filaments are halo clouds caught in the wind . for the superwind in ngc 253 , @xcite dismiss the possibility that diffuse x - ray and filamentary h@xmath0 emission both come from a cooling , volume filling wind",
    "; their argument is also valid for ngc 3079 .    that the towers emit x - rays along their _ entire _ optical length is an important constraint , because the radial velocities of the optically emitting filaments show a linear gradient from 200 to @xmath681000 km  s@xmath6 with height above the disk @xcite until they overturn in a vortex in the top third of the superbubble ( cbvf ) .",
    "the ubiquitous x - ray emission suggests that the superwind has driven cool disk gas into the halo , with x - rays being emitted either as upstream , stand - off bow shocks or by cooling at cloud / wind conductive interfaces . in either case ,",
    "the x - ray emitting skin is thin and would plausibly coincide at our resolution with the optical line emitting filaments , e.g.  for preshock density @xmath69 @xmath40 , the separation would be @xmath70 arcsec scaled for shock speed in units of 500 km  s@xmath26 . in this picture , the wind strips gas from the walls of the dense disk cavity , and this gas then fragments into disintegrating streams by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "the fragments gradually disperse , and eventually become rayleigh - taylor unstable in the top third of the superbubble where they pass through the vortex and begin to drip toward the disk .",
    "the filaments are embedded in the wind that flows past them to reach into the halo .",
    "the soft x - rays may arise as optical line - emitting clouds evaporate into a region of unseen , hot ( 10@xmath71 k ) x - ray gas that fills the superbubble .",
    "because the cloud column density is surely @xmath72 @xmath73 , we can use the saturated thermal conductive rates determined by @xcite .",
    "the approximate cloud lifetime for saturated thermal evaporation without an inhibiting magnetic field is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the thermal cloud pressure in @xmath76 erg  @xmath40 ( @xmath77 k @xmath40 ) , @xmath78 is the cloud temperature in @xmath79 k , and @xmath80 is the cloud column density in 10@xmath81 @xmath73 that is unfortunately unconstrained by existing optical spectra of the superbubble .",
    "however , because clouds reach high into the galaxy halo from the disk , we can set a lower limit on their column densities by equating @xmath82 to the cloud crossing time @xmath83 myr , obtaining @xmath84 .",
    "the visible clouds that have survived conductive evaporation are therefore those with column densities @xmath85 @xmath40 and hence large sizes ( if cylindrical , @xmath86 pc ) and total masses @xmath87 m@xmath60 , consistent with the ionized masses determined in cbvf .      the detection of fe k line emission addresses the question of whether the agn is directly responsible for the superbubble .",
    "extended filamentation is seen in both seyfert galaxies ( where circumnuclear starbursts are commonly observed ) , and in starburst galaxies that do not show strong nuclear x - ray sources .",
    "starburst galaxies commonly show an ionization gradient in the extended filaments , in the sense that inner filaments appear to be photoionized while the outer ones are more shock - like ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) , although @xcite have found a starburst - driven filament system that is shock - like throughout . from morphology alone , it is difficult to distinguish a shock from a photoionization process : hydrodynamics can shape filaments that are then photoionized by the central starburst . in the case of m82 , a well defined ionization cone",
    "is mapped in e.g./h@xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "the optical cone appears to be mostly photoionized from stars whereas the x - ray cone appears to be shock excited . in ngc 1068 , where winds and radiation are both known to be important , the agn radiation field",
    "is thought to explain both the optical and x - ray emission , and this object appears to have an x - ray photoionization cone @xcite . on uv energetics",
    "alone , it is also impossible to distinguish between agn or starburst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "a gas temperature derived from both the x - ray and the optical emission is crucial to establishing the energy source .",
    "the mean energy of an ionizing photon in photoionized gas is much smaller than that required to ionize the medium collisionally , hence shock heated gas is considerably hotter .",
    "suitable optical data do not yet exist for the superbubble of ngc 3079 .",
    "true wind energetics are elusive because they depend on both the supernova source energetics and the thermalization efficiency @xmath10 . before _",
    ", x - ray observations of starburst cores had lacked spatial resolution to resolve the contributions of x - ray binaries .",
    "now , acis on _ chandra _ can search for hot gas in the starburst core , and @xcite argue that they have detected it in m82 . summing the energy in a wind like that in m82 with best estimates for the filling factors in various gas phases ,",
    "one finds that it is still substantially below the energy derived using the radio - determined supernova rate and a moderate to high ( 2050% ) thermalization efficiency .",
    "moreover , @xcite argue that the supernova rate in m82 may be substantially higher than inferred from radio counts .",
    "these suggest that we are missing much of the outflow energy , in agreement with multi - phase hydrodynamical models @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the outflowing gas is almost all entrained disk and halo gas , not wind material . as evidence for this , the outer filaments in m82 ( and ngc 1482 ,",
    "* ) share the rotation of the galaxy disk , and the pattern of magnetic fields and gas motions in ngc 3079 ( cbvf ) strongly suggest that the top of the superbubble is forming a vortex .",
    "second , hot gas exists in superwinds @xcite and appears to be moving faster than the cooler gas , inconsistent with standard superbubble models @xcite but resembling the pattern seen in hydrodynamical wind simulations @xcite .",
    "evidence for extensive supernova remnants in the disk of ngc 3079 is ambiguous ( see  4.3 of cbvf ) .",
    "we thus address wind energetics from the constraints derived previously on the efficiency of thermalization .",
    "the energetics of the soft x - ray component in the superbubble that we constrained in  [ sec : towers ] are comparable to those determined by @xcite for the diffuse wind in ngc 253 .",
    "this arises even though the x - ray emitting filaments in ngc 3079 may have much higher density .",
    "_ chandra _ reveals a remarkably tight correspondence ( @xmath8808 , 65 pc ) between optical line and x - ray emitting filaments in the superbubble of ngc 3079 .",
    "the bubble is embedded in a conical distribution of more diffuse x - rays . west of the nucleus",
    ", this emission extends into the optically obscured , radio counterbubble .",
    "east of the nucleus ( i.e.  on the near side of the galaxy ) a funnel is also delineated by extremely narrow optical line emitting filaments that rise several kpc above the galaxy disk , supporting our earlier contention that they form the contact discontinuity / halo shock of the wind .",
    "these filaments connect back to the disk at one end and at the other , perhaps , to an x - ray ridge that seems to curve back toward the cone axis .",
    "however , at present x - ray sensitivity , the loop does not close completely , so the wind may escape the galaxy .",
    "a deeper _ chandra _ exposure would confirm this x - ray extension , and would double spatial resolution of the superbubble to tighten the volume of the emission integral hence constraints on derived physical parameters .    even without a complete understanding of the physical process ,",
    "the close association between the _ chandra _ and _ hst _ emission is important for several reasons .",
    "first , powerful winds must be involved either directly or indirectly in producing this filamentary complex .",
    "second , high resolution joint _",
    "chandra / hst _ studies of the filaments in this galaxy , m82 @xcite , ngc 253 @xcite , and ngc 1068 @xcite show that both the x - ray and optical emission is highly clumped , with resolved structures seen down to our resolutions of 65 pc ( _ chandra _ ) and 15 pc ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "the evidence for entrainment in these winds is compelling ( e.g.  cbvf ) , and we suspect that most of the superwind mass resides in the filamentary complex .",
    "we agree with the assessment of @xcite that the smallest cloud scales in simulations must be very well sampled to treat cloud entrainment and acceleration correctly @xcite .",
    "the resolution of present wind models @xcite is ten times too large to match the observed clumping scales , arguing for a new generation of hydrodynamical models to establish testable predictions on cloud internal properties . in the meantime , we may be seriously underestimating the mass lost in superwinds , and therefore their influence within and around the host galaxy .",

    "<S> using _ chandra _ and _ hst _ we show that x - ray and h@xmath0 filaments that form the 1.3-kpc diameter superbubble of ngc 3079 have strikingly similar patterns at @xmath108 resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this tight optical line / x - ray match seems to arise from cool disk gas that has been driven by the wind , with x - rays being emitted from upstream , stand - off bowshocks or by conductive cooling at the cloud / wind interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the soft x - ray plasma has thermal and kinetic energies @xmath2 erg and @xmath3 erg , where @xmath4 is the filling factor of the x - ray gas and may be small ; these are comparable to the energies of the optical line - emitting gas . </S>",
    "<S> hydrodynamical simulations reproduce the observations well using large filling factors for both gas phases ; assuming otherwise leads to serious underestimates of the mass lost in superwinds and therefore their influence within and around the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> x - rays are also seen from the base of the radio counterbubble that is obscured optically by the galaxy disk , and from the nucleus ( whose spectrum shows the fe k@xmath5 line at 6 kev as well as gas absorbed by a moderate neutral hydrogen column ) . </S>",
    "<S> the superbubble is surrounded by a fainter conical halo of x - ray emission that fills the area delineated by high angle , h@xmath0-emitting filaments , supporting our previous assertion that these filaments form the contact discontinuity / shock between galaxy gas and shocked wind . </S>",
    "<S> this x - ray emission is not significantly edge brightened , indicating a partially filled volume of warm gas within the shocked wind , not a shell of conductively heated gas . </S>",
    "<S> about 40  ( 3 kpc ) above the galaxy disk an x - ray arc may partially close beyond the bubble , but the north - east quadrant remains open at the surface brightness attained by _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _ , consistent with the notion that the superwind has broken out into at least the galaxy halo . </S>"
