    "today there are many efforts in theoretical physics that try to combine quantum theory and general relativity .",
    "several lines of research have been developed but none of them is completely successful in obtaining a complete description of the quantum gravity realm .",
    "meanwhile , some phenomenological approaches have been put on the table .",
    "one of them is the modification of the dispersion relation @xmath0 @xcite , with a non linear version instead .",
    "it is very probable , after the most of the results , that the linear version of the relation linking energy and momenta is just a first approximation to a real non lineal one .",
    "on the other hand , some data seem to invite to introduce a minimal length in physical theories . indeed ,",
    "there already exist well theoretically established theories , such as string theory or loop quantum gravity , that have some fundamental quantities : the planck longitude @xmath1 , the associated time scale @xmath2 and the planck energy @xmath3 .",
    "all of them suppose that beyond these thresholds , the physics should change dramatically .    some proposals to modify the lorentz boosts through are the approximations called double special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite .",
    "these theories are based on a generalization of lorentz transformations through a more broad point of view of a kind of conformal transformations @xcite , where there are two observer independent scales , velocity of light and planck length .",
    "these theories are rather polemical , but they are of increasing interest because they can be useful as effective new tools in gravity theories for example , in cosmology as an alternative to inflation @xcite , or in other fields like propagation of light @xcite , that are related , for instance , to cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "there are several works about the so called rainbow gravity , as an example @xcite and references there in , but the history begins more or less with a treatment done in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we review the structure of effective potential of a btz black hole , motivated by the fact that black holes provide gravity conditions to test quantum effects due to the discrete nature of spacetime or the existence of a limit in the energy that a particle can bear .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we recall the effective potential treatment in a btz black hole . in the third section",
    "we introduce the rainbow hypothesis , and in the fourth one we discuss conclusions .",
    "the metric of a btz black hole @xcite is :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined as :    @xmath7    here , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "m is the mass and j the angular momentum of the black hole . in order to apply the effective potential method",
    ", we define de lagrangian of a particle in this metrics as .    @xmath11    where dots indicate derivation with respect to a affine parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we can find two movement integrals in the lagrangian [ lag ] .",
    "making the variations in @xmath13 and in @xmath14 respectively we get :    @xmath15    @xmath16    is worth to mention that @xmath17 can not be identified directly with the energy of the particle because the metric is not flat when @xmath18 tends to infinite .",
    "but , we will call it energy because it comes from the variation of the lagrangian respect to the coordinate time .",
    "furthermore , it is possible find another movement constant , @xmath19 . where @xmath20 has the values @xmath21 for timelike geodesics ( massive particles ) and @xmath22 for null geodesics ( massless particles ) .",
    "using the results of @xcite , we can calculate the velocity in terms of two potentials :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 , and the effective potentials are :    @xmath26    where    @xmath27",
    "let s introduce now the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the metric .",
    "these functions are analog to those introduced by @xcite in the nonlinear version of the dispersion relation @xmath30 , but we are going to choose they in a way that does nt modify the speed of light , that is to say @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , we claim that these functions tend to @xmath21 when @xmath32 where @xmath33 can be identified with a fundamental length scale @xmath34 .",
    "so we choose @xmath35 as :    @xmath36    then , the lagrangian is modified in the following way .",
    "@xmath37    now , we can find two movement integrals for this new lagrangian :    @xmath38    and    @xmath39    now , we can find an equation for the velocity in terms of effective potentials , in an analog way to the normal case , with the re scaled variables ,    @xmath40    and using re scaled variables of the last section the velocity is expressed as :    @xmath41    where    @xmath42    the plot of the original and new effective potentials for a massive particle and for a massless particle are depicted in fig.1 :     ( a ) and when @xmath43 ( b).,width=642 ]    in fig .",
    "1 we can see that the potentials become flat when @xmath44 , so a massive particle can now become free for a suitable distance far from the black hole .",
    "furthermore , the zone where the velocity is non real in eq [ eqb ] , is reduced almost to zero , even it s not totally null .",
    "the plot of the original and new effective potentials for a massless particle and for a massless particle are depicted in fig.2     ( a ) and when @xmath43 ( b).,width=642 ]    in fig .",
    "2 we can see that the potentials is flat when @xmath44 , as they are in the non modified case , but a massive particle has a not allowed energies where the velocity is non real in eq [ eqb ] , broader than in the original case .",
    "in this work we have seen that the introduction of functions @xmath45 has a very impressive consequences .",
    "the structure of the orbits allowed , due the deformation of the effective potentials for a massless particle and the ligated state for a massive particle are very distorted from the classic case .",
    "these results lead to think that it is worth to investigate about another kinds of black holes , specially in 3-d searching for observable perturbations in cosmological issues ."
