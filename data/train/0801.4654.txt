    "loosely bound nuclei are liable to breakup in a nuclear collision process .",
    "the breaking up of the nucleus can , subsequently , affect the other nuclear processes in a manner not observed in collisions involving only tightly bound nuclei .",
    "extensive investigations , both experimentally and theoretically , are being pursued in recent years to understand the effect of breakup on elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "one of the primary motivations is to probe the influence of break up process on the threshold behaviour of optical potential at near the coulomb barrier energies .",
    "the conventional threshold behaviour of the optical potential for tightly bound nuclei shows a rapid rise in the strength of the real potential in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier with a sharp fall in the strength of the imaginary potential in the same energy range .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the coupling of relative motion to other reaction channels like inelastic excitations , transfers to the bound states contributes an attractive real polarization potential which in turn enhances the real strength at energies around the barrier @xcite .",
    "the rapid decrease of fusion and other of the reaction processes with decreasing energy induces the sharp fall in the strength of the imaginary potential .",
    "the observed threshold behaviours of the potential components for the tightly bound nuclei are demonstrated to be connected by a dispersion relation , a manifestation of causality in nuclear collision process @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical effect of coupling to break up channels of weakly bound projcetiles is to introduce a repulsive real polarization potential @xcite . at above barrier energies the effect of breakup of the projectile",
    "was demonstrated through the reduction needed in the strength of the folded real potential describing the elastic scattering of projectiles like @xmath7li and @xmath8be @xcite . with the bombarding energy decreasing for the scattering of @xmath0li projectile ( breakup threshold = 1.67 mev ) from heavy targets , the real potential strength exhibits a decline around the coulomb barrier energy while the imaginary potential exhibits a rise in the surface strength @xcite .",
    "attempt has been made to understand this behaviour in terms of dispersion relation @xcite and the observed threshold behaviour is termed as breakup threshold anomaly ( bta ) . for targets like @xmath9pb , due to strong coulomb field , the breakup reaction channels do not close down rapidly near the barrier or at sub - barrier energies .",
    "experimental observations suggest that the breakup cross section is even larger than the fusion cross section in the vicinity of the barrier @xcite .",
    "as the coupling to breakup process contributes a repulsive dynamical polarization potential , the normal threshold anomaly ( ta ) in the real potential arising out of the attractive real polarization contribution of the conventional couplings , may disappear .",
    "the effective real potential strength may even show a declining trend with with further decrease in energy if the breakup coupling dominates over the conventional couplings at near barrier energies .",
    "recently , so , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown , based on the extended optical model approach , that the real and imaginary polarization potential components for scattering of @xmath0li from @xmath9pb , when decomposed into direct and fusion contributions , satisfy the dispersion relation separately . the fusion part in this case showing a conventional threshold behaviour while the direct part exhibits a smooth and relatively weak energy dependence .",
    "for @xmath10li , a more strongly bound projectile ( b.u .",
    "threshold = 2.43 mev ) compared to @xmath0li , the optical potential describing the scattering from heavy targets shows up a threshold behaviour like the strongly bound projectiles @xcite and the energy variations of the real and imaginary components can be connected by the dispersion relation prediction .",
    "scattering of the weakly bound nuclei on lighter targets throws up a more complicated situation .",
    "the analyses of elastic scattering of @xmath7li from @xmath11si @xcite show that both these projectiles , despite having different breakup threshold , exhibit similar trend in energy dependence of optical potential components .",
    "the imaginary potential for @xmath0li+@xmath11si does not show the characteristic rise on approaching the barrier , rather it decreases after a small rise in strength just above the barrier .",
    "the real potential on the other hand is energy independent with a slight tendency to decrease as energy is decreased . unlike the observations of scattering from lighter target nuclei , f.a .",
    "souza , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have found that the optical potential describing the elastic scattering of @xmath0li and @xmath10li from medium mass @xmath12co exhibits a behaviour similar to that of the more tightly bound systems indicating the existence of a conventional threshold anomaly .",
    "however , as pointed out by the authors , looking at the energy dependence of the real and imaginary strengths of @xmath0li+@xmath12co system carefully one can also categorize the threshold behaviour as breakup threshold anomaly ( bta ) . on approaching the barrier",
    ", the real strength shows a weak declining trend .",
    "the surface strength of the imaginary potential rises in the same energy region before falling again with decreasing energy .",
    "no attempt has been made to establish the dispersion relation connectivity between the observed behaviours .",
    "further investigation of @xmath0li scattering from medium mass targets is , therefore , necessary to identify the general behaviour of the interaction potential around the barrier . in general , for medium and light mass targets with reduced strength of the coulomb field , the coulomb induced breakup cross section is expected to decrease near the barrier .",
    "thus the open question is how far the breakup of loosely bound projectiles , in the presence of conventional couplings , determines the threshold behaviour of interaction potentials for medium or light mass targets ?",
    "the answer to this question will also address to the problem of target mass dependence of threshold anomaly for loosely bound projectiles .",
    "we report , in this context , a systematic investigation of elastic scattering of @xmath0li from @xmath13ni targets at bombarding energies around the barrier .",
    "the isotopes of ni have very similar deformation values , @xmath14=0.17 and 0.18 respectively for @xmath4ni and @xmath1ni .",
    "it was demonstrated by keeley _",
    "_ @xcite that both these isotopes exhibit similar threshold behaviour of potential for scattering with @xmath15o indicating that the threshold anomaly developed predominantly from inelastic couplings .",
    "we intend to investigate the energy dependence of the optical potential for the projectile @xmath0li scattered from these two ni isotopes .",
    "the primary interest is to see the manifestation of coupling to the continuum on the threshold behaviour of the inetraction potential in the presence of strong inelastic couplings .",
    "the elastic scattering angular distributions for @xmath0li+@xmath1ni have been measured at bombarding energies around the barrier to compare with the existing data of @xmath0li+@xmath4ni @xcite .",
    "the experimental details have been given in section 2 .",
    "the model calculation and the analysis have been presented in section 3 , followed by the results and discussion in section 4 .",
    "the experiment was carried out at 14ud tifr / barc pelletron facility in mumbai , india .",
    "self - supporting targets were prepared by electron gun evaporation technique from 99% enriched metallic @xmath1ni isotope .",
    "two different targets of thickness 61@xmath16g/@xmath17 and 376@xmath16g/@xmath17 respectively , were used for the experiment .",
    "the targets were bombarded with @xmath0li beam from the pelletron at energies of 13 , 14 , 17 , 19 and 26 mev .",
    "the beam current during the experiment was varied from 1 to 7 pna .",
    "the current was measured using a current integrator , the output of which was fed into a camac scaler to obtain the integrated charge .",
    "the elastically scattered particles were detected with conventional telescope arrangement .",
    "two silicon surface barrier detector telescopes were used in the two parts of the experiment . in the first part the telescopes were set with 25@xmath16 and 15@xmath16 thick @xmath18e detectors and 300@xmath16 thick e detectors to detect the scattered particles . in the second part the @xmath18e detectors of thickness 15@xmath16 and 10@xmath16 were used and these were followed by 3 mm and 500@xmath16 e detectors respectively .",
    "the telescopes were placed on a rotatable arm at an angular separartion of 10@xmath19 .",
    "the solid angles subtended by the telescopes at the target centre were 0.076 , 0.17 , 0.06 and 0.11 msr respectively .",
    "the angular opening corresponding to these solid angle values were in the range of 0.5@xmath19 to 0.8@xmath19 .",
    "two monitor detectors of thickness 3 mm were mounted at @xmath2015@xmath19 about the beam axis . at a distance of 41.7 cm in a 1 m diameter scattering chamber .",
    "these two detectors were used to monitor the beam position and also for the purpose of normalization .",
    "calibration runs were taken with a standard bi target after each energy change .",
    "using the rutherford scattering between @xmath0li and @xmath21bi at these energies , the detector solid angles and the relative normalization between the telescopes were determined from the calibration runs . the statistical error in the data is less than 1% in the forward angles and a maximum of 16% in the backwards angles .",
    "the overall error in the data varied from 5% to 17% .",
    "the data were recorded using the linux based data acquisition system lamps @xcite .",
    "the measured elastic cross sections with respect to the rutherford cross sections are shown in fig.1 along with the model ( see next section ) calculations .",
    "optical model ( om ) analysis was carried out using three different model potentials .",
    "firstly we performed the optical model analysis of our @xmath0li+@xmath1ni data using the parametric woods saxon ( ws ) forms for both the real and imaginary potentials .",
    "subsequently , the new data of @xmath0li+@xmath1ni and the existing data of @xmath0li+@xmath4ni @xcite were further analysed with two other model potentials , namely , ( i ) the renormalized folded real and imaginary potentials , and ( ii ) a hybrid potential consisting of a renormalized folded real and a parametric woods saxon imaginary components .",
    "the use of different model potentials was intended to make the extraction of energy dependence of the surface strengths of the potential components as much model independent as possible .",
    "the phenomenological optical model potential used to describe the elastic angular distributions at each energy had the following form    @xmath22\\ ] ]    where v(r ) denotes the volume type ws real potential , @xmath23(r ) is a volume type ws imaginary potential to simulate the fusion after penetration of the barrier and @xmath24(r ) is a derivative type ws imginary potential to account for the absorption due to reactions occuring at the surface .",

    "the average value of the crossing radius was estimated to be 9.8 @xmath20 0.4 fm .",
    "the strengths of the potential components were determined at this radius to obtain the energy dependent behaviour of the potentials . in fig.2 ,",

    "following the analysis of the @xmath0li+@xmath1ni data with the phenomenological woods saxon potential , a further analysis of the new data of @xmath0li+@xmath1ni and the existing data of @xmath0li+@xmath4ni @xcite were performed with folded m3y potential .",

    "the mass densities of @xmath4ni and @xmath1ni were obtained from ref.@xcite . a parametric form for @xmath0li charge density @xcite",
    "was unfolded for finite proton distribution to obtain the point proton distribution .",

    "the best fit values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are given in table 2 and the corresponding fits are shown by dotted lines in figs.1 and 3 for @xmath0li+@xmath1ni and @xmath0li+@xmath4ni respectively .",
    "the same condition , as described in the case of phenomenological potential , was used to determine the error limits in the values of the individual renormalization factors . to obtain the best fit parameters of the omp2 potentials for both the isotopes ,",
    "analysis was started with the highest energy data .",

    "the @xmath33 minimization process yielded different sets of parameter values for omp2 producing almost equivalent fits to the data .",
    "the @xmath51 value for each set of parameters lies within the range of @xmath52 corresponding to the set of best fit parameters . in fig.4",
    "the crossing points at 14 mev laboratory energy for @xmath0li+@xmath4ni and @xmath0li+@xmath1ni systems have been compared .",
    "it is to be noted that with omp2 we have obtained the sensitive radius of the imaginary potential only .",
    "the observed crossing points are quite sharp for @xmath0li+@xmath1ni but for @xmath0li+@xmath4ni the crossing points are not so unambiguos at certain energies .",
    "the radii of sensitivity for imaginary potentials found from the analyses of the data vary with the incident energy .",
    "the value increases by @xmath5325% at the lowest energy studied . at the higher incident energies the values of the crossing radii are close to the strong absorption radii , r@xmath54 , of the systems .",
    "considering the energy variation of the crossing radius and the uncertainty associated with it , we have used in the dispersion relation the integral quantities g@xmath55(e ) defined as    @xmath56    where g(r ) is the gaussian weighting function centered on some average value of the crossing radii and _ x _ denoting either the real potential v(r , e ) or the imaginary potential w(r , e ) for the respective integral quantity .",
    "it was demonstrated that the dispersion relation can be extended to the integral quantities with gaussian weighting function @xcite , such that    @xmath57    where    @xmath58    the gaussian weighting function has the usual form of    @xmath59}\\ ] ]    the choices of radius parameter @xmath60 and the width parameter @xmath61 of the gaussian weighting function are very crucial for systems involving light , loosely bound projectiles .",
    "although the regions of sensitivity are narrow at each energy , the crossing radii vary with energy .",
    "to identify the suitable values of r@xmath62 and @xmath61 , we estimated the uncertainties associated with the integral quantities with different combinations of ( r@xmath62,@xmath61 ) .",
    "it can easily be understood that the range of uncertainties associated with g@xmath63(e ) and g@xmath64(e ) at a particular energy changes significantly depending upon the proximity of the chosen r@xmath62 to crossing radius at that energy .",
    "so the final choice of r@xmath62 and @xmath61 is a compromise relative to the uncertainties associated with g@xmath63(e ) and g@xmath64(e ) at each energy .",
    "the chosen value of r@xmath62 is 9.8fm for both @xmath1ni and @xmath4ni targets .",
    "the associated @xmath61 was chosen to be 0.6fm .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the choice of r@xmath62 does not really change the overall trend of the energy variations of g@xmath63(e ) and g@xmath64(e ) .",
    "the quantities g@xmath63(e ) and g@xmath64(e ) as functions of incident energy for @xmath1ni and @xmath4ni are shown in figs.5 and 6 .",
    "the error bars shown in the figures predominantly arise out of the variations in the values of the _ good potentials _ at r@xmath62 within the width defined by @xmath61 . in fig.7",
    ", we have shown the best fit normalizations @xmath39 and @xmath40 , obtained with model potential omp1 , as a function of energy for @xmath0li+@xmath13ni .",
    "errors shown are estimated individually for each parameter using the condition of eq.4 .",
    "the plotting of these normalization factors directly is justified considering the fact that dispersion relation involving these factors will not depend on the choice of the radial point for the evaluation of the energy integration .",
    "the phenomenological analysis of @xmath0li+@xmath1ni data with woods saxon potential having variable geometry with decreasing energy yielded an energy dependence of the surface strengths of the real and imaginary components shown in fig.2 .",
    "the variations resulted from the model potentials omp1 , with fixed geometry real and imaginary components , and omp2 , with fixed geometry real and variable geometry imaginary components , are also shown in fig.2 .",
    "good matching in the surface strengths of the imaginary potential at all the energies have been obtained for the three different model potentials used in the anlysis .",
    "the magnitude of the real strength , however , shows some kind of model dependence . despite the difference in the magnitudes , the three model potentials exhibit similar trend in the energy variation of the real strength .",
    "the observed variation indicates that the strength of the imaginary potential increases initially as the @xmath0li projectile energy approaches the barrier for the system . with further decrease of incident energy the strength of the imaginary",
    "potential starts to decrease . on the otherhand",
    ", the real strength shows an overall increase with decreasing energy although there is a tendency to decline around 18 mev energy .",
    "this feature is more prominent in the case of phenomenological potential with variable geometry .",
    "the observed variations of g@xmath64(e ) in figs.5 and 6 also indicate the same behaviour for the strengths of the imaginary and the real potentials for both the ni isotopes as the @xmath0li projectile energy approaches the barrier for the systems . in order to find the connectivity between the energy dependence of the real and imaginary components through the dispersion relation , we fitted the observed variation of g@xmath64(e ) with the following functional form    @xmath65    with this three linear segments form of energy dependence for g@xmath64(e ) , the dynamical contribution to the real part , _",

    "it has been determined assuming that the function ( @xmath72 ) behaves as a linear function of energy e in the sub - barrier region @xcite .",
    "@xmath73 is the energy at which the increasing and the decreasing linear segments intersect while @xmath74 is the energy beyond which the variation of @xmath75(e ) or rather the imaginary potential w(e ) is assumed to be independent of energy .",
    "the values of the coefficients @xmath76 and energies @xmath77 for both the systems are given in table 2 .",
    "the solid curves in the plots of @xmath78(e ) vs. e in figs.5 & 6 indicate the dispersion relation prediction following eq.10 .",
    "the general agreement with the observed trend in @xmath78(e ) is quite good considering the simple form employed to describe @xmath75(e ) .",
    "as it appears from figs.5 and 6 , the imaginary potential , for both @xmath0li+@xmath4ni and @xmath0li+@xmath1ni , shows a distinct increasing trend as the energy approaches the barrier but with further lowering of energy below the barrier it starts to decrease .",
    "the interplay of the dispersive contributions of these two regions in w(e ) constitute the effective energy dependence of the real potential .",
    "the resultant energy dependence of the real polarization potential exhibits an overall increasing trend .",
    "this suggests to the presence of _ thershold anomaly _ ( ta ) for @xmath0li scattering from medium mass ni isotopes .",
    "however , a careful inspection also reveals that as the bombarding energy decreases and approaches the barrier , the strength of the real effective potential increases slowly at the beginning and then shows a weak declining trend around 1.2 times the barrier before sharply rising again .",
    "this decreasing tendency of the real potential is associated with the increasing part of the imaginary potential .",
    "similar behaviour for the real and imaginary components of the effective potential has also been observed for @xmath0li+@xmath9pb @xcite , @xmath0li+@xmath12co @xcite and @xmath0li+@xmath79al @xcite systems and has been termd as _ breakup threshold anomaly _ or bta . for @xmath0li+@xmath9pb @xcite , the strength of the real effective potential continues to decrease even below the barrier indicating the presence of reaction channels , like break up , producing strong repulsive real polarization even at sub barrier energies .",
    "however , our investigation of @xmath0li scattering from medium mass ni - isotopes suggests that the observed threshold anomaly has the usual form albeit modified by coupling to breakup ( or channels producing repulsive real polarization ) .",
    "a recent two - body continuum discretized coupled channel ( cdcc ) calculation @xcite for @xmath0li on @xmath12co has shown that the real potential does exhibit an overall increasing trend while the imaginary potential falls of after a short increase near the barrier .",
    "it is , therefore , extremely important to investigate the target mass dependence of _ threshold anomaly _ for projectiles with low breakup threshold , as has been pointed out by beck , _ et al . _",

    "it is to be noted that the variation of the renormalization parameters is independent of the choice of interaction distance .",
    "for both the systems the variations in @xmath39 and @xmath40 with incident energy are very similar to the variations observed in the integral quatities @xmath78(e ) and @xmath75(e ) .",
    "the observed energy dependence of @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath0li+@xmath4ni and @xmath0li+@xmath1ni in fig.7 does not indicate of any dramatic isotopic variation .",

    "this is also obvious from the values of e@xmath80 parameter in table 2 .",
    "the the fall off in the imaginary strength around the barrier is slower in the case of lighter ni isotope but the large error bars in the lowest energies do not allow the observation to be conclusive .",
    "exclusive coincident measurement of fragments produced in break up or transfer followed by break up reactions at these bombarding energies can throw some light on the possible difference in the observed behaviour .",
    "in this work the elastic scattering angular distributions measured in the bombarding energy range 13 mev @xmath81 26 mev around the coulomb barrier for the system @xmath0li+@xmath1ni have been presented .",

    "but there is definite tendency to decline in the energy region where the imaginary potential shows an increasing nature .",
    "the observed energy dependences of the real and imaginary potentials corroborate with the observations from the study of @xmath0li+@xmath12co and @xmath0li+@xmath79al systems .",
    "this particular nature of the interaction potential close to the barrier has been argued to be due to the coupling to the continuum .",
    "however , unlike the @xmath0li+@xmath9pb system , the real potential instead of decreasing further in the sub - barrier energy region shows a sharp rise . a dispersion relation prediction for the real potential behaviour assuming a simple 3-linear segment description of the energy dependence of the imaginary potential describes nicely the observed energy variation of the real component . in order to pinpiont the threshold behaviour of the interaction potential with loosely bound projectiles , further experimental investigations with more precision and in smaller energy steps around the barrier",
