    "ngc 1399 , the central galaxy of the fornax group , is one of the brightest elliptical galaxies in x - rays and has been the subject of numerous x - ray studies . although previous _ rosat _  and",
    "_ asca _  studies demonstrated that the hot gas within @xmath10  kpc is not isothermal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the data could not distinguish between single - phase and multiphase models .",
    "moreover , we showed that an `` fe bias '' for systems like ngc 1399 occurs if an isothermal gas is assumed when in fact the spectrum consists of multiple temperature components with values near 1 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we argued that this bias is primarily responsible for the very sub - solar fe abundances found in the central regions of the ( x - ray ) brightest ellipticals and groups .",
    "the combined spatial and spectral resolution of the _ xmm _  ccds allows for unprecedented mapping of the temperatures and elemental abundances of the hot gas in galaxies , groups , and clusters .",
    "these capabilities complement the high spatial resolution ( @xmath11 ) of _ chandra_which has already provided interesting constraints on the emission from discrete sources near the center of ngc 1399 @xcite . the higher energy resolution ,",
    "sensitivity , and larger field - of - view of the _ xmm _  epic ccds are better suited for constraining the spatial and spectral properties of the diffuse hot gas out to radii well past the optical extent of the galaxy ( i.e. , out to @xmath7  kpc assuming a distance of 21  mpc using the results of @xcite for @xmath12  km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 ) .",
    "we present initial results for the temperature and metal abundances of the hot gas obtained from a new _ xmm _  observation of ngc 1399 .",
    "detailed discussions of the data reduction , spectral fitting , and results for the gravitating mass will appear in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "ngc 1399 was observed with the epic pn and mos ccd cameras for approximately 25  ks and 30  ks respectively during ao-1 as part of the _ xmm _  guest observer program .",
    "we generated calibrated events lists for the data using the standard sas v5.3.0 software .",
    "our data preparation closely follows standard procedures and will be described fully in a follow - up paper @xcite .",
    "we extracted spectra in concentric circular annuli located at the x - ray centroid of each detector .",
    "the widths of the annuli were the same for each detector and were defined such that the width of each annulus contained approximately 6000 background - subtracted counts in the 0.3 - 5  kev band in the mos1 , and the minimum width was set to @xmath14 for psf considerations .",
    "obvious point sources were masked out before the extraction .    in each annulus",
    "we performed a simultaneous fit to the mos1 , mos2 , and pn spectral data over 0.3 - 5  kev .",
    "our baseline model ( 1 t ) consists of a single thermal plasma component using the apec  code modified by foreground galactic absorption ( @xmath15  @xmath16 ) using the phabs  model in xspec  v11.1.0v .",
    "the free parameters are all associated with the plasma component : temperature ( @xmath17 ) , normalization , and fe , o , mg , and si abundances  all other elements tied to fe in their solar ratios except for s which is tied to si in their solar ratio .",
    "( the normalizations for the mos1 and mos2 are tied together while that of the pn is varied separately because of residual calibration and background differences . )",
    "we obtained results for the 1 t model fitted directly to the data projected on the sky ( i.e. , 2d model ) and also fitted to the deprojected data ( i.e. , 3d model ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this model is a good fit in the outer annuli but the fit degrades at progressively smaller radii ( see table [ tab ] ) .",
    "the worst fit is in the central annulus and , as shown in figure [ fig.spec ] , yields fit residuals near 1  kev that are fully characteristic of those obtained when trying to force a single - temperature model to fit a multi - temperature spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the deviations above 2  kev also suggest the presence of another ( higher ) temperature component .",
    "multitemperature spectra in the inner regions , especially the central bin , can arise simply from the projection of hotter gas at larger radius . in this case fitting the 1 t model to the deprojected spectra should substantially improve the fits in the central regions .",
    "however , we find that this 1 t ( 3d ) model does not improve the fits much except at the center , where noticeable  though relatively modest  improvement ( @xmath23 ) is achieved .    we have examined a variety of multitemperature models ( 2d and 3d ) and have found that simple two - temperature models ( 2 t ) provide the best fits to the central annuli ( table [ tab ] ) .",
    "it is also found that the @xmath20 values are very similar and the derived parameters consistent within their @xmath24 errors for both 2d and 3d versions of the 2 t models . and",
    "since the parameters of the 3d models are not as well constrained and require regularization of the temperatures and abundances ( cf .",
    "* ) , in the interest of brevity we will emphasize in this letter the results for the 2d models .",
    "detailed results for the 3d versions of 1 t , 2 t , and other models will appear in @xcite .    with respect to the 1 t ( 2d ) model , not only does the 2 t ( 2d ) model improve the fit substantially within the central bin ( @xmath25 ) , but it also significantly improves the fits in annuli # 2 ( @xmath26 ) and # 3 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the dramatic improvement in the central bin is seen in figure [ fig.spec ] where the large residuals in the fe l region near 1 kev have been mostly eliminated . in 3d",
    "the improvement of 2 t over 1 t is @xmath28 in the central bin .",
    "the other multitemperature models we examined only improved fits to the deprojected spectra in the central bins ; e.g. , a ( constant pressure ) cooling flow model consisting of ambient and cooling gas provides a modest improvement to the fit in the central bin ( @xmath29 ) over the 1 t ( 3d ) model .    in figure [ fig ]",
    "are shown the temperatures obtained for the 2 t ( 2d ) model .",
    "the cool component is consistent with an isothermal radial profile while the hot component appears to rise slightly at the center . within the @xmath24 errors",
    "this central rise for the hot component is not especially significant , but if real the slight excess over the isothermal extrapolation from the adjacent annuli probably represents the contribution from hard emission from discrete sources unresolved by _",
    "xmm _  but resolved in the _ chandra _  image of ngc 1399 @xcite .",
    "we mention that adding an additional bremsstrahlung component to account for the effect of these unresolved sources ( i.e. , 2t+brem ) in the central bin does improve the fit slightly and gives a reasonable best - fitting temperature , @xmath30  kev . adding this component to the cooling flow model instead gives @xmath31  kev indicating an attempt to account for both @xmath32  kev hot gas and @xmath33  kev unresolved sources .",
    "_ we believe that in addition to the @xmath20 values the derived parameter values also argue in favor of the 2 t model . _",
    "the temperature of the hot component , @xmath34  kev , is consistent with the virial temperature of a surrounding group of mass @xmath35 , whereas the temperature of the cool component , @xmath36  kev , is similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars ( @xmath37  kev ) with velocity dispersion , @xmath38  km  s@xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the volume - averaged electron density of the cool gas ( ) declines with radius more rapidly than that of the hot component ( ): for the best - fitting models the ratio @xmath39 is 1.0 , 0.62 , and 0.27 respectively for shells # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 .",
    "( here we have used the 3d model so that the quoted densities refer to the 3d spherical shells bounded by the same radii as the annuli listed in table [ tab ] . )",
    "the cool component is only detected out to annulus # 3 ( i.e. , for @xmath4  kpc ) and therefore must contribute even less at larger radius .",
    "the radius where the cool ( galaxy ) component gives way to the hot ( group ) component is similar to that inferred from the recent analysis of the _ rosat _  surface brightness profile of ngc 1399 by @xcite .",
    "interior to shell # 3 we compute a gravitating mass of @xmath40 from each component consistent with previous x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) determinations .",
    "the consistency of the masses determined from each phase , and the agreement with optical determinations , indicates that each phase is in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium tracing the same gravitational potential .",
    "although hydrostatic equilibrium implies subsonic gas motions for each phase , the phases are not in pressure equilibrium .",
    "the ratio of the gas pressure in the hot phase to that of the cool phase is @xmath41 in shell # 1 which increases to @xmath42 in shell # 3 .",
    "the lack of pressure equilibrium implies that the low - pressure cool phase must be continuously replenished .",
    "this requirement is consistent with the scenario where the cool phase continuously receives gas from stellar ejecta and loses gas by eventually mixing with the extended hot phase .",
    "detailed physical models for the two phases ( including , e.g. , appropriate filling factors ) will be considered in a future study .",
    "we take the solar abundances in xspec  to be those given by the @xcite table except for fe where we use the correct `` meteoritic '' value , @xmath43 by number , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this value is 1.44 times smaller than the photospheric value which is usually employed in x - ray spectral fitting .",
    "consequently , we shall account for this factor when comparing our results to other studies .",
    "the fe abundances ( ) obtained for the 1 t and 2 t models ( both 2d ) are displayed in figure [ fig ] .",
    "( the values of  obtained from 2d and 3d 2 t models are consistent within 1 - 2  @xmath44 errors . ) at the largest radii the abundance is sub - solar , @xmath45 .",
    "it increases for smaller @xmath46 so that within @xmath47  kpc , @xmath48 , for the 1 t model similar to previous results for 1 t ( 2d ) models fitted to the _ rosat _  data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "compared to the 1 t model , the 2 t model gives  that is 40%-50% larger in annuli # 2 and # 3 and twice as large in annulus # 1 .",
    "( a cooling flow model , when fitted to the deprojected spectra , produces similarly larger values . ) this substantial increase in the value of  along with the elimination of the characteristic @xmath32  kev residual pattern ( figure [ fig.spec ] ) is a manifestation of the `` fe bias '' we have discussed previously for ngc 1399 @xcite and related systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the abundances in each temperature component are tied together in the fits since they can not be distinguished when fitted separately .",
    "also , the values of  deduced in the central bins for both 1 t and 2 t models differ slightly if intrinsic absorption is considered ( which is not clearly required by the data as seen in figure [ fig.spec ] ) , but the relative differences between the 1 t and 2 t models and the general finding of super - solar values are preserved .      next to the broad feature of fe l lines near 1 kev , the most notable spectral lines in the epic spectra of ngc 1399 ( figure [ fig.spec ] ) are the k@xmath49 lines of si and s ; i.e. , ( 1.85  kev ) ,  ( 2.0  kev ) , and ( 2.45  kev ) . we find that  is generally better constrained than , but when these abundances are fitted separately they inevitably yield values that are consistent within their 1 - 2  @xmath44 errors . to reduce the number of free parameters in our fits we tie  and together in their solar ratio .",
    "henceforth , we shall refer only to the si abundance .",
    "the si abundance is plotted in figure [ fig ] for both 1 t and 2 t models .",
    "for the 1 t model @xmath50 for @xmath51  kpc , rises to values consistent with solar for @xmath52  kpc , and is slightly larger than solar in the central bin . for the 1 t model @xmath53 at large radii , @xmath54 for @xmath52  kpc , and @xmath55 in the central bin .",
    "the 2 t model gives slightly larger values , @xmath56 for @xmath52  kpc ( which are consistent with the 1 t values within the @xmath24 errors ) .",
    "but in the central bin the 2 t value is @xmath57 larger ; i.e. , about a @xmath58 discrepancy . in contast to the 1 t case , for the 2 t model , @xmath8 for @xmath59  kpc .",
    "( the overestimate of @xmath60 using the 1 t model is a `` si bias '' related to the fe bias we discussed previously for such systems @xcite . )",
    "( unlike fe and si , the o and mg abundances are quite sensitive to intrinsic absorption",
    ". we will discuss models with intrinsic absorption in @xcite . )",
    "we have performed a spatially resolved spectral analysis of the _ xmm_epic data of ngc 1399 which suggests the presence of two dominant phases of hot gas within the central @xmath61  kpc .",
    "this two - phase description is consistent with 2 t models we fitted previously to the _ asca _  data @xcite .",
    "however , the _ asca _  data lacked the spatial resolution of _ xmm _  and could not distinguish between a radially varying single - phase medium , a two - phase medium , or a cooling flow within @xmath62  kpc .",
    "these results for ngc 1399 are supported by previous analyses of its x - ray surface brightness profile which argues for separate galaxy and group components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) similar to other centrally e - dominated groups @xcite .    since the temperature structure of ngc 1399 obtained by _",
    "asca _  is characteristic of other central e - dominated galaxy groups @xcite , the two - phase structure revealed by _ xmm _  for ngc 1399",
    "likely applies to these other systems .",
    "moreover , since the centers of several clusters show similar multitemperature structure with _ asca _",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and similar multi - component surface brightness structure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , we might expect two - phase structures in the centers of these systems .",
    "a recent _ xmm _  analysis of m87 is consistent with this suggestion @xcite .",
    "the two - phase model provides a physical explanation for the gas density and temperature profiles seen in `` cooling flows '' .",
    "the hotter component is associated with the ambient group or cluster gas while the cooler component is associated with the stellar ejecta of the dominant central galaxy .",
    "gasdynamical models of groups and clusters constructed by @xcite demonstrate that relatively cool ejecta from stellar mass loss combined with the hotter ambient gas can reproduce observed single - phase temperature profiles in groups and clusters .",
    "but our results suggest that these two phases are not fully mixed .",
    "understanding the details of the interaction of these phases may shed light on the mystery of cooling flows . using the results of @xcite , the rate of energy input by stellar ejecta is , @xmath63 , where @xmath64  s@xmath13 is the specific stellar mass - loss rate .",
    "if within @xmath65  kpc we take @xmath66 for the stellar mass and @xmath38 km s@xmath13 @xcite , we infer the rate of energy input into the central @xmath33  kpc of ngc 1399 from stellar ejecta to be @xmath67  erg s@xmath13 . this crude estimate is only a factor of two less than the x - ray luminosity of the hot component ( and a factor of four less than the cool component ) .",
    "if the energy input from stellar ejecta does not completely suppress mass drop - out , it may at least delay the episodes of agn feedback .",
    "problems with such heating models are discussed by @xcite .    the two - phase model ( as well as other multitemperature models )",
    "removes the `` fe bias '' within the central regions ( @xmath4  kpc ) and gives @xmath5 .",
    "these super - solar values exceed the stellar values in typical elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore allow for significant enrichment of the hot gas from type ia supernovae ( snia ) ( cf .",
    "for example , using the results of @xcite and our measured value of @xmath68 solar , we infer that snia have contributed @xmath9 of the iron mass within @xmath7  kpc in ngc 1399 .",
    "this snia fraction is similar to that inferred for the sun and therefore suggests a stellar initial mass function similar to the milky way as advocated by renzini and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we close by noting that although correcting for the `` fe bias '' partially removes the `` iron discrepancy '' noted by @xcite , chemical models of elliptical galaxies without cooling flows predict central iron abundances even larger than we have measured for ngc 1399 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?"
