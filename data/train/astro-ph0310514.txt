    ". however , the known population of quasars can not produce sufficient ionizing radiation @xcite , so star - forming galaxies are most likely the dominant source of ionizing photons at redshifts @xmath2 , a view supported by theoretical studies of reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although the number counts of @xmath5-band `` dropouts '' ( at @xmath6 ) are still heavily debated , it is clear that a substantial population of galaxies with detectable continuum exists at these redshifts .",
    "the next step  discovering a population of objects before the end of reionization  lies behind a technological barrier : most of the light from @xmath2 objects falls in the near - infrared , where backgrounds provide significant challenges from the ground .",
    "high spectral resolution observations provide some relief ; dispersing the light eliminates much of the background noise and allows the detection of line emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at first glance , weak star formation and a neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) would appear to critically hamper the detection of ly@xmath0 at high redshift .",

    "the amount of ly@xmath0 that we can observe from young star - forming objects depends on the imf and metallicity in early galaxies , the amount of attenuation within the galaxy itself , and the amount of scattering in the intergalactic medium : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the observable ly@xmath0 flux per unit of star formation , @xmath22 is the optical depth due to dust in the galaxy , @xmath23 is the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the star - forming galaxy and thus create no ly@xmath0 photons at the source , and @xmath24 is the total fraction of ly@xmath0 photons that penetrate the intergalactic medium and reach us .",

    "recent models and the interpretation of high - redshift galaxies provide some constraints on these quantities .    * the imf : * theoretical models predict a top - heavy imf for the first generation of stars formed in metal - free gas @xcite .",
    "these stars can radiate more than an order of magnitude more ionizing photons per unit solar mass than a salpeter imf , resulting in much stronger ly@xmath0 and heii(@xmath26 ) @xcite .",
    "however , only the initial generations of stars will be formed from completely pristine gas ; thus , one major source of uncertainty is whether luminous bursts of star formation later in the process ( @xmath16 ) will be too enriched to exhibit extremely top - heavy imfs .    *",

    "both scenarios make assumptions that are relatively favorable for detecting ly@xmath0 emission , such as the presence of a top - heavy imf in high - redshift galaxies . if regions of intense star formation are sufficiently chemically enriched by @xmath9 to have a salpeter imf from @xmath51 , @xmath25 is reduced by a factor of @xmath52 , depending on metallicity . with @xmath53 years of cosmic time available for star formation before @xmath54 , delaying chemical enrichment sufficiently long may require suppressing star formation at early times , as would be the case if the power spectrum were reduced on small scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , inhomogeneous structure formation may lead to pockets of low - metallicity star formation even at late epochs @xcite .",
    "observationally , rest - frame equivalent widths of ly@xmath0 as late as @xmath55 support the hypothesis that the imf may be top - heavy at late epochs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and from fossil elemental abundances @xcite .",
    "a simple argument shows that for even a moderate ly@xmath0 emitter , detecting ly@xmath0 from the ground at high spectral resolution is easier than detecting the continuum emission .",
    "for example , in the j - band window at 1.122@xmath56 ( ly@xmath0 at z=8.2 ; see sec .",
    "3.1 ) , assuming a mauna kea sky background and observations in which sky noise dominates , the signal - to - noise ratio of a suitably located @xmath57 observation of ly@xmath0 becomes equal to or better than that of a broad - band continuum observation ( @xmath58 ) when the rest - frame @xmath59   . at @xmath60 ,",
    "the threshold is @xmath61   .",
    "observed rest - frame ly@xmath0 equivalent widths of @xmath62 galaxies exceed 150    @xcite and starburst models predict equivalent widths far in excess of 100    for most young starburst scenarios @xcite .",
    "thus , detection in ly@xmath0 is likely the most powerful way to identify and map very high - redshift star formation from the ground .",
    "observing spectral features between the strong atmospheric lines helps to minimize the background in the near - infrared .",
    "although there are existing spectrographs with high enough resolution to observe between oh lines , the relatively low number density of detectable objects predicted by simulations argues for blind searches for ly@xmath0 emitters in a large , contiguous field ( @xmath63 ) . because narrow - band filters with @xmath64 are not widely available , the most effective current strategy is to identify the broadest oh - free windows in the night sky ; fig .",
    "[ fig : oh ] illustrates some windows in the @xmath8-band , including a wide window at @xmath65 with @xmath1980% ( variable ) atmospheric transmission .",

    "[ fig : sim ] shows a @xmath70 corner of the `` optimistic '' simulation ; the thickness of the simulation is 44% less than the thickness of an @xmath67 observation , so the simulation actually underrepresents the number of sources expected in this scenario .",
    "allowing for the depth and angular size of the simulation , the volume probed by the entire q5 model is 5.14 times larger than the volume of a single @xmath67 narrow - band filter observation with a @xmath70 detector .",

    "contaminants from lower redshifts must be identified with additional data .",
    "deep broad - band images in both the optical and near - infrared will serve this purpose . for example , for a 32-hour narrow - band observation at @xmath67 , @xmath8-band data that is deeper than @xmath1925.9 ( ab ) should reveal all continuum sources in the narrow - band image .",

    ", the target objects will be identifiable as @xmath77-band dropouts and distinguishable from lower redshift contaminants which will appear in the optical bands .",
    "the remaining possible contaminants are low-@xmath77 objects with strong emission lines and no detectable continuum . in all cases , however , the emission lines must be prohibitively strong for the objects to remain undetected in extremely deep broad - band images . for the scenario described above , if a detected emission line in the 1.122  @xmath78 m window is actually [ oii](@xmath79 ) , the @xmath80 galaxy would have to have an unphysical equivalent width of @xmath19800    or more ( rest - frame ) to remain undetected in a deep f606w observation ( 29.3 magnitude limit at @xmath81 , corresponding to the hdf - north data ) .",
    "other emission lines place similar requirements on the high - redshift objects , including both qso lines and strong galaxy lines .",

    "looking further into the future , the detailed physical study of these objects  an exploration down the luminosity function , measurements of ly@xmath0 line profiles , and the detection of fainter spectral emission lines  is probably the role of the next generation of large ground - based telescopes .",
