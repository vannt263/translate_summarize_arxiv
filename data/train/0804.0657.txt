    "the _ square peg problem _ is beautiful and deceptively simple .",
    "it asks whether every jordan curve @xmath0 has four points which form a square .",
    "we call such squares _ inscribed _ into  @xmath1 ( see figure  [ f : inscribe - babochka ] ) .",
    "the problem goes back to toeplitz ( 1911 ) , and over almost a century has been repeatedly rediscovered and investigated , but never completely resolved . by",
    "now it has been established for convex curves and curves with various regularity conditions , including the case of piecewise linear curves .",
    "while there are several simple and elegant proofs of the convex case , the piecewise linear case is usually obtained as a consequence of results proved by rather technical topological and analytic arguments .",
    "in fact , until to this paper , there was no direct elementary proof .",
    "here we present two such proofs in the piecewise linear case .    * main theorem . *",
    "_ every simple polygon on a plane has an inscribed square . _    as the reader will see , both proofs are direct and elementary , although perhaps not to the extend one would call them `` book proofs '' .",
    "the proofs are strongly motivated by the classical ideas in the field ( see section  [ s : history ] ) . here and there , we omit a number of minor straightforward details , in particular the deformation construction at the end of the second proof .    the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in the next two sections we present the proofs of the main theorem . these proofs are completely separate and can be read independently . in the last section we give an outline of the rich history of the problem and the underlying ideas .",
    "the historical part is not meant to be comprehensive , but we do include a number of pointers to surveys and recent references .",
    "let @xmath2 \\in \\rr^2 $ ] be a simple polygon .",
    "we assume that  @xmath3 is generic in a sense which will be clear later on .",
    "further , we assume that the angles of  @xmath3 are _ obtuse _",
    ", i.e.  lie between @xmath4 and  @xmath5 .",
    "fix a clockwise orientation on  @xmath3 .    for an ordered pair @xmath6 of points",
    "@xmath7 denote by  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 the other two vertices of a square @xmath10 $ ] in the plane , with vertices on  @xmath3 in this order , as shown in figure  [ f : inscribe - sqjerrard ] .",
    "parameterize  @xmath3 by the length and think of @xmath6 as a point on a torus @xmath11 .",
    "denote by @xmath12 the subset of pairs  @xmath6 so that @xmath13 . similarly , denote by @xmath14 the subset of pairs  @xmath6 so that  @xmath15 .",
    "our goal is to show that  @xmath16 intersects  @xmath17 .",
    "first , observe that for a generic  @xmath3 the set of points @xmath18 is finite . indeed , these points  @xmath19 lie in the intersection of the polygon  @xmath3 and a polygon  @xmath20 obtained by a counterclockwise rotation of  @xmath3 around  @xmath21 by an angle  @xmath4 ( see figure  [ f : inscribe - sqjerrard ] ) .",
    "therefore , if  @xmath3 does not have orthogonal edges there is only a finite number of points in @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , when  @xmath21 moves along  @xmath3 at a constant speed , these intersection points  @xmath23 change piecewise linearly , which implies that  @xmath16 is also piecewise linear .",
    "let us show that  @xmath16 is a disjoint union of simple polygons .",
    "observe that when  @xmath21 is moved along  @xmath3 the intersection point @xmath24 can not disappear except when a vertex of  @xmath3 passes through an edge of  @xmath20 , or when a vertex of  @xmath20 passes through an edge of  @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that when  @xmath21 is moved along  @xmath3 the intersection points emerge and disappear in pairs , and thus  @xmath16 is a union of polygons .",
    "note that for a generic  @xmath3 , at no time can a vertex pass through a vertex , which is equivalent to the condition that no square with a diagonal  @xmath25 can have a point @xmath26 as its third vertex .    to see that the polygons in  @xmath16 are simple and disjoint ,",
    "observe that the only way we can have an intersection if a vertex of  @xmath20 changes direction at an edge in  @xmath3 , or , similarly , if a vertex of  @xmath3 changes direction at an edge in  @xmath20 .",
    "this is possible only when  @xmath21 and either  @xmath23 or  @xmath8 are vertices of  @xmath3 . since  @xmath3 is chosen to be generic we can assume this does not happen , i.e.  that @xmath3 does not have an inscribed right isosceles triangle with an edge  @xmath25 .",
    "a similar argument also implies that on a torus  @xmath27 , the set  @xmath16 separates points @xmath28 with the corresponding vertex  @xmath8 inside of  @xmath3 , from those where  @xmath8 is outside . by continuity , it suffices to show that the point  @xmath8 crosses the edge of  @xmath3 as the generic point @xmath6 crosses  @xmath16 .",
    "consider a point @xmath29 such that the corresponding third vertex of a square  @xmath8 lies in the relative interior of an edge  @xmath30 in  @xmath3 .",
    "now fix  @xmath21 and change  @xmath23 .",
    "since  @xmath3 is generic , point  @xmath8 will pass through the edge  @xmath30 , which implies the claim .",
    "we need a few more observations on the structure of  @xmath16 .",
    "first , observe that  @xmath16 does not intersect the diagonal @xmath31 . indeed , otherwise we would have a sequence of inscribed right triangles @xmath32 converging to the same point , which is impossible since  @xmath3 does not have angles between @xmath4 and @xmath33 ( see figure  [ f : inscribe - sq - disappear ] ) . in a different direction , observe that for a generic  @xmath21 the number of points in  @xmath34 is odd .",
    "this follows from the previous argument and the fact the number of intersections of  @xmath3 and  @xmath20 as even except at a finite number of points  @xmath21 .",
    "now , from above we can conclude that at least one of the polygons in  @xmath16 is not null homotopic on the torus  @xmath27 , since otherwise for a generic point  @xmath21 the size of  @xmath34 is even .",
    "fix one such polygon and denote it by  @xmath35 . since  @xmath35 is simple , not null homotopic and",
    "does not intersect the diagonal  @xmath36 , we conclude that  @xmath35 is homotopic to  @xmath36 on  @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , there exist a continuous family of inscribed right isosceles triangles @xmath38 such that when  @xmath21 goes around  @xmath3 so do  @xmath23 and  @xmath8 . relabeling triangles @xmath38 with @xmath39 we obtain a simple polygon @xmath40 which is also homotopic to  @xmath36 on  @xmath27 .",
    "suppose now that  @xmath35 and  @xmath41 do not intersect .",
    "together with  @xmath36 these curves separate the torus  @xmath27 into three regions : region  @xmath42 between @xmath36 and  @xmath35 , region  @xmath43 between  @xmath35 and @xmath41 , and region  @xmath1 between @xmath41 and  @xmath36 ( see figure  [ f : inscribe - jr - regions ] ) .",
    "consider the pairs @xmath6 in the regions  @xmath42 and  @xmath1 which lie close to  @xmath36 ( i.e.  @xmath21 and  @xmath23 lie close to each other on  @xmath3 ) . clearly , for such @xmath6 , either both corresponding points  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 lie _ inside _  @xmath3 or both  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 lie _ outside _ of  @xmath3 .",
    "let  @xmath42 be the former and let  @xmath1 be the latter regions . from above , for all @xmath44 we have @xmath45 and @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , when  @xmath21 is fixed and  @xmath23 is moved along  @xmath3 counterclockwise starting at  @xmath21 , of the points  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 the first to move outside of  @xmath3 is always  @xmath8 .    now , consider the smallest right equilateral triangle  @xmath46 inscribed into  @xmath3 ( the existence was shown earlier ) .",
    "there are two ways to label it as shown in figure  [ f : inscribe - jr - smallest ] . for the first labeling ,",
    "if  @xmath21 is fixed and  @xmath23 is moved as above , the first time point  @xmath8 lies on  @xmath3 is when  @xmath23 and  @xmath8 are vertices of  @xmath46 . by assumptions on region @xmath47",

    "the corresponding point  @xmath8 lies outside of  @xmath3 , a contradiction . and  @xmath23 with  @xmath48 smaller than that in  @xmath46",
    ", we must have @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , we can have all these pairs in  @xmath1 and the same argument will work when  @xmath42 is substituted with  @xmath1 and the inside / outside properties are switched accordingly .",
    "the point is , by continuity , all close  @xmath6 with a fixed order on  @xmath3 determined by  @xmath46 , must lie in the same region ( either  @xmath42 or  @xmath1 ) . ]    finally , suppose  @xmath3 is not generic .",
    "we can perturb the vertices of  @xmath3 to obtain a continuous family of generic polygons converging to  @xmath3 and use the limit argument . since  @xmath3 is simple",
    ", the converging squares do not disappear and converge to a desired inscribed square .",
    "similarly , when  @xmath3 has angles  @xmath50 or @xmath51 , use the limit argument by cutting the corners as shown in figure  [ f : inscribe - jr - corner ] .",
    "in this section , we prove the following extension of the main theorem : every generic simple polygon has an odd number of inscribed squares . now that we have the relation , we can try to prove that it is invariant under certain elementary transitions .    [",
    "t : deform - square ] every generic simple polygon has an odd number of inscribed squares .-",

    "the main theorem now follows by a straightforward limit argument .",
    "note also that the theorem is false for _ all _ simple polygons ; for example every right triangle has exactly two inscribed squares .",

    "then there exists a unique square @xmath56 $ ] such that @xmath57 and  @xmath42 is oriented clockwise .",

    "fix @xmath60 .",
    "rotate  @xmath54 around  @xmath61 by  @xmath4 , and denote by  @xmath62 the resulting line , and by @xmath63 the intersection point .",
    "except when @xmath64 , such  @xmath65 is unique .",
    "denote by  @xmath66 the inverse rotation of  @xmath65 around  @xmath61 .",
    "we obtain the right isosceles triangle @xmath67 oriented clockwise in the plane .",
    "the fourth vertex  @xmath68 of a square is uniquely determined .",
    "start moving  @xmath61 along  @xmath69 and observe that the locus of  @xmath68 is a line , which we denote by  @xmath70 .",
    "since line  @xmath71 is in general position with respect to  @xmath72 , these two line intersect at a unique point  @xmath73 , i.e.  determines uniquely the square  @xmath74 $ ] as in the theorem . .",
    "the second part follows from immediately from the above construction .",
    "we begin with the following restatement of the second part of the lemma .",
    "let @xmath2 $ ] be a generic simple polygon and let @xmath75\\}$ ] be its continuous piecewise linear deformation .",
    "suppose @xmath56 $ ] is an inscribed square with vertices  @xmath76 at different edges of  @xmath3 , and none at the vertices of  @xmath3 , i.e.  @xmath77 .",
    "then , for sufficiently small  @xmath78 , there exists a continuous deformation @xmath79 of inscribed squares , i.e.  squares @xmath80 inscribed into  @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , for sufficiently small  @xmath78 , the vertices @xmath76 of  @xmath80 move",
    "monotonically along the edges of  @xmath81 .",
    "consider what can happen to inscribed squares  @xmath80 as  @xmath78 increases .",
    "first , we may have some non - generic polygon  @xmath82 , where such square in non - unique or undefined .",
    "note that the latter case is impossible , since by compactness we can always define a limiting square  @xmath83 .",
    "if the piecewise linear deformation  @xmath84 is chosen generically , it is linear at time  @xmath85 , and we can extend the deformation of  @xmath80 beyond  @xmath83 .    the second obstacle is more delicate and occurs when the vertex  @xmath76 of square  @xmath83 is at a vertex  @xmath86 of  @xmath82 .",
    "clearly , we can no longer deform  @xmath83 beyond this point .",
    "denote by  @xmath87 the edge of  @xmath3 which contains vertices  @xmath76 of @xmath80 for @xmath88 .",
    "clearly , @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "denote by  @xmath91 the other edge adjacent to  @xmath9 .",
    "denote by @xmath92 and  @xmath93 the other three edges of  @xmath3 containing vertices of  @xmath80 ( see figure  [ f : deform - sq - move ] ) .",
    "now consider a family @xmath94 of squares inscribed into lines spanned by edges  @xmath95 and  @xmath93 . by construction , @xmath96 .",
    "there are two possibilities : either the corresponding vertex  @xmath97 approaches  @xmath86 from inside  @xmath91 or from the outside , when @xmath98 and  @xmath99 . in the former case ,",
    "we conclude that the number of inscribed squares decreases by  2 as  @xmath78 passes through  @xmath85 . in the latter case ,",
    "one square appears and one disappears , so the parity of the number of squares remains the same . in summary ,",
    "the parity of the number of squares inscribed into  @xmath81 with vertices at different edges is invariant under the deformation .",
    "it remains to show that one can always deform the polygon  @xmath3 in such a way that at no point in the deformation do there exist inscribed squares with more than one vertex at the same edge , and such that the resulting polygon has an odd number of inscribed squares .",
    "fix a triangulation @xmath27 of  @xmath3 .",
    "find a triangle  @xmath36 in  @xmath27 with two edges the edges of  @xmath3 and one edge a diagonal in  @xmath3 .",
    "subdivide the edges of  @xmath3 into small edges , so that neither of the new vertices is a vertex of an inscribed square .",
    "if the edge length is now small enough , we can guarantee that no square with two vertices at the same edge is inscribed into  @xmath3 .",
    "now move the edges along two sides of the triangle  @xmath36 toward the diagonal as shown in figure  [ f : deform - square ] .",
    "repeat the procedure . at the end",
    "we obtain a polygon  @xmath100 with edges close to an interval .",
    "observe that  @xmath100 has a unique inscribed square ( see figure  [ f : deform - square ] ) .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    . the square peg problem of inscribed squares has a long and interesting history .",
    "it seems , every few years someone new falls in love with it and works very hard to obtain a new variation on the problem .",
    "unfortunately , as the results become stronger , the solutions become more technically involved and several of them start to include some gaps , still awaiting careful scrutiny .",
    "interestingly , the impression one gets from the literature is that that no direct elementary proof is even possible in the piecewise linear case , as the problem is difficult indeed , the existing techniques are inherently non - discrete and , presumably , other people have tried .      .",
    "we begin with the celebrated incorrect proof by ogilvy  @xcite .",
    "while the proof was refuted by several readers within a few months after its publication , it is still worth going over this proof and try find the gaps ( there are three major ones , even if one assumes that the curve is piecewise linear or analytic ) .",
    "as reported in  @xcite , ogilvy later became disillusioned in the possibility of a positive resolution of the problem .      .",
    "the first major result was proved by emch , who established the square peg problem for convex curves  @xcite .",
    "later , emch writes in  @xcite that toeplitz and his students discovered the result independently two years earlier , in  1911 , but never published the proof .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for further references to proofs in the convex case ) .",
    "emch starts by constructing a family of inscribed rhombi with a diagonal parallel to a given line . by rotating the line and using uniqueness of such rhombi",
    "he concludes that one can continuously rotate a rhombus into itself with two diagonals interchanged .",
    "then the intermediate value theorem implies that at some point the rhombus has equal diagonals , thus giving a square .    in the largely forgotten followup paper  @xcite , hebbert studies the squares inscribed into quadrilaterals , essentially proving lemma  [ l :",
    "deform - square - lines ] .",
    "he stops short of applying his observations to general simple polygons .",
    "let us mention also that in the second proof we use the fact that every non - convex polygon can be triangulated .",
    "this is a standard result also due to emch  @xcite .      .",
    "an important breakthrough was made by shnirelman in  1929 , when he offered a solution for curves with piecewise continuous curvature .",
    "this paper was published in an obscure russian publication , but later an expanded version  @xcite was published posthumously .",
    "guggenheimer in  @xcite studied this proof , added and correct several technical points , and concluded that for shnirelman s proof to work the curve needs to have a bounded variation .",
    "shnirelman noted that for a generic curve the parity of the number of inscribed squares must be invariant as the curve is deformed .",
    "the proof uses a local lemma on existence of inscribed square for closed curves , a non - linear version of hebbert s observation ( and , most likely , completely independent ) . for",
    "the connectivity of curves with continuous curvature and bounded variation shnirelman and guggenheimer use known advanced results in the field .",
    "finally , the fact that every ellipse with unequal axis has a unique inscribed square is straightforward .    our proof in section  [ s : deform ]",
    "is modeled on the deformation idea of shnirelman ( we were unaware of hebbert s paper ) . in the piecewise linear case",
    "we no longer have the analytic difficulties , but we do get the unpleasant obstacle of having inscribed squares with more than two vertices on the same edge .",
    "in fact , if not for the smooth case , there is no intuitive reason behind theorem  [ t : deform - square ] .",
    "interestingly , we believe we know where shnirelman got the idea of his proof . at the time of his first publication , shnirelman was working with lyusternik on the conjecture of poincar which states that every smooth convex surface has at least three closed geodesics .",
    "this conjecture was made in the foundational paper  @xcite , where poincar proves that at least one such closed geodesics exists ( on analytic surfaces ) , and this proof uses a similar deformation and parity argument .      .",
    "in 1961 , jerrard rediscovered the square peg problem and proved it for analytic curves .",
    "he was apparently motivated by the kakutani s theorem that every convex body has a circumscribed cube .",
    "this result itself followed a series of earlier similar results ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and was later extended by dyson , floyd , and others .",
    "jerrard s proof was a model of our proof in section  [ s : triangles ] .",
    "he similarly considers a curve  @xmath16 on a torus  @xmath27 , corresponding to inscribed right isosceles triangles .",
    "he then uses a parity argument to conclude that  @xmath16 is not null homotopic , and a separate argument to conclude that when moving along  @xmath16 the fourth vertex can not stay on the same side of the polygon .",
    "our approach has several advantages due to the fact that we can make them generic and thus avoid squares which have to be double counted .",
    "also , we use a straightforward ad hoc argument with the minimal inscribed triangle , different from that by jerrard .",
    "overall , most details are still different due to the different nature of intersections of analytic and piecewise linear curves .      .",
    "in recent years , further results on the square peg problem have appeared , most notably  @xcite and  @xcite , which both weakened the restrictions on the curves and extended the reach of the theorem ( to certain space quadrilaterals in  @xcite and to rectangles in  @xcite ) . in fact",
    ", there is a long history of variations on the problem , which goes back to  @xcite .",
    "let us mention some of them .",
    "first , there are several results on inscribed triangles and rhombi and rectangles in general jordan curves  @xcite .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for the survey and further references .",
    "second , there are several results on cyclic quadrilaterals inscribed into sufficiently smooth curves  @xcite .",
    "note that in the piecewise linear case , unless a quadrilateral  @xmath101 is an isosceles trapezoid , one can always take a sufficiently slim triangle  @xmath3 , such that no polygon similar to  @xmath102 is inscribed into  @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding `` isosceles trapezoid peg problem '' is open for general piecewise linear curves .",
    "we believe that our proof by deformation might be amenable to prove this result , but not without a major change .    in a different direction , an interesting `` table theorem '' in  @xcite",
    "says that every sufficiently nice function  @xmath103 on a convex set  @xmath104 has an an inscribed square of given size , defined as four points in  @xmath16 which are vertices of a square and have equal value of  @xmath103 .",
    "if the graph of  @xmath103 is viewed as a two - dimensional hill , the inscribed square can be interpreted as feet of a square table , thus the name .",
    "note that when the curve  @xmath1 ( in the square peg problem ) is a starred region , applying the table theorem to the cone over  @xmath1 gives the desired square inscribed into  @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for more on the table theorem and other related results .",
    "finally , there is a large number of results extending the square peg problem to higher dimensions , including curves ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and surfaces ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these results are too numerous to be listed here .",
    "we refer to surveys  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  b2 ) and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem  11 ) for further references .      .",
    "in conclusion , let us mention that although stated differently , the results for many classes of curves are essentially equivalent .",
    "we already saw this phenomenon in both proofs , where we applied what we called the _",
    "limit argument_. in each case , we obtained one polygon as the limit of others and noted that the sizes of inscribed squares do not converge to zero .",
    "of course , this approach fails in general , e.g.  a rectifiable curve can be obtained as the limit of piecewise linear curves , but a priori the inscribes squares can collapse into a point .",
    "nonetheless , one can use the limit argument in may cases that appear in the literature .",
    "it is easy to derive the square peg problem for analytic curves from that of piecewise linear curves .",
    "similarly , the piecewise linear curves can be obtained a a limit of analytic curves and derive our main theorem from jerrard s paper .",
    "it would be interesting to see how far the limit arguments take use from the piecewise linear curves .",
