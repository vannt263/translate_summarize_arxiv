    "among the many recent developments in @xmath0 systems , the application of pseudo - hermitian ideas into the realm of electronic circuitry not only promises a new generation of electronic structures and devices , but also provides a platform for detailed scrutiny of many new concepts within a framework of easily accessible experimental configurations .",
    "a first example of this was the demonstration in ref .",
    "@xcite that a pair of coupled @xmath1 circuits , one with amplification and the other with equivalent amount of attenuation , provided the simplest experimental realization of a @xmath0 symmetric system . with a normal mode structure where all dynamical variables are easily measured in the time domain",
    ", extensions of the circuit approach will provide a valuable testing ground for further developments into more sophisticated structures .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-circuitry approach suggested also opens new avenues for innovative electronics architectures for signal manipulation from integrated circuits to antenna arrays , and allows for direct contact with cutting edge technological problems appearing in ( nano)-antenna theory , split - ring resonator arrays , and meta - materials .",
    "examples of @xmath0-symmetric systems range from quantum field theories and mathematical physics @xcite to atomic @xcite , solid state @xcite and classical optics @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-symmetric system can be described by a phenomenological `` hamiltonian '' @xmath2 which may have a real energy spectrum , although in general @xmath2 is non - hermitian .",
    "furthermore , as some parameter @xmath3 that controls the degree of non - hermiticity of @xmath2 changes , a spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry breaking occurs . at this point , @xmath4 , the eigenfunctions of @xmath2 cease to be eigenfunctions of the @xmath0-operator , despite the fact that @xmath2 and the @xmath5-operator commute @xcite .",
    "this happens because the @xmath0-operator is anti - linear , and thus the eigenstates of @xmath2 may or may not be eigenstates of @xmath0 . as a consequence , in the _ broken _ @xmath6-symmetric phase",
    "the spectrum becomes partially or completely complex .",
    "the other limiting case where both @xmath2 and @xmath0 share the same set of eigenvectors corresponds to the so - called _ exact _ @xmath5-symmetric phase in which the spectrum is real .",
    "this result led bender and colleagues to propose an extension of quantum mechanics based on non- hermitian but @xmath0-symmetric operators @xcite .",
    "the class of non - hermitian systems with real spectrum has been extended by other researchers in order to include hamiltonians with generalized @xmath0 ( antilinear ) symmetries @xcite .",
    "while the applicability of these ideas in the quantum framework is still being debated , optical systems provide a particularly fertile ground where @xmath0-related concepts can be realized @xcite and experimentally investigated @xcite . in this framework , @xmath0 symmetry demands that the complex refractive index obeys the condition @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath0-synthetic materials can exhibit several intriguing features .",
    "these include among others , power oscillations and non - reciprocity of light propagation @xcite , absorption enhanced transmission @xcite , and unidirectional invisibility @xcite . despite these efforts and the consequent wealth of theoretical results associated with @xmath0-structures , until very recently only one experimental realization of a system with balanced gain and loss has been reported @xcite .",
    "these authors studied the light propagation in two coupled @xmath0 symmetric waveguides where the spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking `` phase transition '' @xcite was indirectly confirmed .",
    "the analysis relied on the paraxial approximation which under appropriate conditions maps the scalar wave equation to the schrdinger equation , with the axial wavevector playing the role of energy and with a fictitious time related to the propagation distance along the waveguide axis .",
    "this observation led us recently to propose a new set - up based on active lrc circuits where the novel features of @xmath0- symmetric structures can reveal themselves and can be studied both theoretically and experimentally in great detail .",
    "the system consists of a pair of coupled electronic oscillators , one with gain and the other with loss .",
    "this `` active '' dimer , is implemented with simple electronics , and allow not only for a direct observation of a spontaneous @xmath0-symmetric `` phase transition '' from a real to a complex eigenfrequency spectrum but also for its consequences in the spatio - temporal domain .",
    "at the same time the equivalent scattering system , where a localized @xmath0 symmetric structure is connected to one or two transmission line ( tl ) leads allow us to access the validity of recent theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "this paper presents our recent results pertaining to the @xmath0 electronics . we begin with a general discussion of electronics in the context of @xmath0 symmetric systems in section  [ sec : elec ] .",
    "then in section  [ sec : dim_modes ] we examine the normal mode structure of the simplest such circuit , the @xmath0 dimer .",
    "we experimentally demonstrate how it displays all the novel phenomena encountered in systems with generalized @xmath0-symmetries .",
    "section  [ sec : dim_dyn ] discusses the unique aspects of @xmath0 dynamics exhibited by the dimer , particularly upon passage from the exact to broken phase . in section  [ sec : scat ]",
    "we investigate the simplest possible scattering situation where the dimer is coupled to a single tl , and derive a non - unimodular conservation relation connecting the left and right reflectances .",
    "a direct consequence of this relation is the existence of specific frequencies for which the system behaves either as a perfect absorber or as an amplifier , depending on the side ( gain or loss ) to which the tl is coupled . in section  [ sec : scat2 ]",
    "we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that a two - port @xmath0-symmetric electronic cavity can act as a simultaneous coherent perfect absorber ( cpa)-amplifier .",
    "our circuit is the electronic equivalent of a cpa - laser device which was recently proposed in the optics framework , and constitutes the first experimental realization of such devices .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : expcon ] presents several issues involving practical implementation of @xmath0 circuits , along with some related experimental details .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "one of the most convenient advantages of an electronic approach is that , at least in the low frequency domain , where the wavelength is significantly greater than the dimensions of the circuit , all spatial symmetry considerations can be reduced to a matter of network topology defined through the application of kirchoff s laws .",
    "physical symmetry is irrelevant as long as the network has the desired node topology and the connecting elements are appropriately valued .",
    "analogous to the familiar case of a @xmath0-symmetric potential , the parity operation is equivalent to the interchange of labels corresponding to pairs of associated circuit components .        for simplicity , we will restrict our discussion to the usual fundamental physical devices : resistors , capacitors and inductors .",
    "only the resistor , due to it s dissipative nature , requires modification upon time - reversal where we include generic ohmic elements with either positive or negative resistance .",
    "negative resistance represents the simplest conceptual inclusion of amplification into electronics since kirchoff s laws can be used without modification .",
    "[ fig : nics ] illustrates how simple linear amplifiers can be configured to achieve negative resistance . the schematic implementation in ( a ) results in a single , ground - referenced node , while that in ( b ) shows a true two - terminal configuration .",
    "the former is of greatest utility due to it s simplicity and the pervasiveness of ground nodes ( defining a common zero potential ) in typical circuits .",
    "section  [ sec : expcon ] discusses further details of the experimental negative resistance converters .",
    "-symmetric electronic dimer . both mutual inductance coupling and capacitive coupling",
    "are included for generality.,width=336 ]    theoretical analysis of circuits including negative resistance elements , however , requires respecting a subtle condition : any two terminal circuit structure reducing to a pure negative resistance will be undefined unless the structure is placed in parallel with a capacitance .",
    "this conclusion results from the divergence of the pole associated with parallel @xmath8 combinations ( with negative @xmath9 ) in the limit of @xmath10 .",
    "this pole only arises if parallel capacitance is initially considered , so is hidden , and often overlooked in the consideration of negative resistance circuits .",
    "it is inconsequential with normal , positive resistance , where it s sign corresponds to exponential decay .",
    "for example , the standard series @xmath1 circuit , though it appears to have a mathematically well behaved solution for negative @xmath9 , is invalid in that realm due to the hidden pole .",
    "our choice of the parallel @xmath1 configurations was dictated by this consideration .",
    "thus , for a @xmath0-symmetric circuit incorporating these basic elements , it is necessary that ( 1 ) all reactive elements either have representation in parity - associated network pairs , or connect parity inverted network nodes , ( 2 ) all ohmic elements are paired with opposite sign , and ( 3 ) each negative ohmic element has an associated parallel capacitance , or ac equivalent , as part of the circuit .",
    "valid @xmath0-circuits of arbitrary complexity can be built up using these simple rules , though their stability needs to be independently determined . in principle",
    ", the long - wave approximation could be relaxed with an appropriate inclusion of waveguide connections , however , this would return geometry into the mix of @xmath0 considerations .",

    "@xmath13 eliminating the currents from the relations , scaling frequency and time by @xmath14 , and taking @xmath15 and @xmath16 gives the matrix equation : @xmath17 at this point , it is obvious that the system is @xmath0 symmetric : swapping the indices and changing the sign of @xmath18 leaves the equations unchanged .",
    "this linear , homogeneous system has four normal mode frequencies , as required to fulfill any arbitrary initial condition for voltage and current , given by @xmath19 with the @xmath0 symmetry breaking point identified as @xmath20 and the upper critical point by @xmath21 note that the given forms explicitly show all of the relationships among the critical points and the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies .",
    "the exact phase , @xmath22 , is characterized by four purely real eigenfrequencies coming in two pairs of positive ( @xmath23 ) and negative ( @xmath24 ) values , while in the broken phase below the upper critical point , @xmath25 the eigenfrequencies are coming in complex conjugate pairs with non - vanishing real parts , and above @xmath26 , as two purely imaginary complex conjugate pairs .",
    "the broken phase of the @xmath0 dimer is unstable , in that it is ultimately dominated by an exponentially growing mode .",
    "the normal modes in the exact phase are characterized by equal magnitudes for the voltage oscillations in the gain and loss sides , which in the @xmath27 , real part convention allowed by the real eigenfrequencies , are given by @xmath28 with a phase @xmath29 of the loss side @xmath30 .",

    "this property can be explored using an overall output coefficient @xmath177 defined as @xcite @xmath178 note that in the case of a single - port scattering set - up discussed earlier in this section , the @xmath177-function collapses to the left / right reflectances .",
    "we can further simplify the above expression using eq .",
    "( [ mmatrixgeneral ] ) , together with the property @xmath158 .",
    "we get @xmath179 at the singularity frequency point @xmath175 and for a generic ratio @xmath180 , the @xmath181-function diverges as @xmath182 and the circuit acts as an amplifier / laser . if on the other hand , we assume that @xmath163 ( perfect adsorbtion condition ) , we get @xmath183 in the context of electronics , the two port simultaneous laser / absorber properties are manifest as a delicate balance of the driven , marginally stable circuit . the singular behavior of the theoretical @xmath177 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lasabs](a ) , solid curves , illustrate that at the janus frequency @xmath184 the injected signals can result in either amplification or complete attenuation , depending on the relative amplitude and phase of the injected signals .",
    "the perfect absorption condition is particularly sensitive to the injection parameters : the deviation of the experimental data , fig .",
    "[ fig : lasabs](a ) dots , is characteristic of component imbalance of less than @xmath185 .",
    "in fact , the minimally absorbing experimental points near the dip in the attenuation curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : lasabs](a ) can only be obtained by an independent determination of the minimal reflectance condition at each frequency .",
    "[ fig : lasabs](b ) shows this extreme sensitivity to the phase of the right input signal near @xmath184 and illustrates our current experimental limits to the observation of the janus condition .",
    "although the fundamental theoretical aspects of @xmath0 electronic circuits is straightforward , it is important to realize that all physical electronic elements deviate from their ideal intended function in two distinctly different ways .",
    "first , all have unintentional or stray impedances  resistive and reactive components  that can become significant as frequency changes .",
    "second , all components , particularly amplifiers , are subject to linearity limits .    the experimental dimer , equivalent to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : basic_dimer ] with either the inductive or capacitive coupling , consists of a pair of coupled @xmath105 circuits , one with amplification in the form of the negative resistance , and the other with equivalent attenuation .",
    "the circuit was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be a simple realization of the @xmath0-symmetric dimer .",
    "each inductor is wound with @xmath186 turns of # 28 copper wire on @xmath187 diameter pvc forms in a @xmath188 loose bundle for an inductance of @xmath189 .",
    "the coils are mounted coaxially with a bundle separation adjusted for the desired mutual inductance @xmath190 .",
    "the isolated natural frequency of each coil is @xmath191 .",
    "the actual experimental circuit includes several additions to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : basic_dimer ] acknowledging the physical realities mentioned above .",
    "first , a resistive component associated with coil wire dissipation is nulled by an equivalent ohmic gain component applied in parallel to each coil .",
    "a discussed in section  [ sec : elec ] , it is not possible to directly apply a series ohmic gain for this compensation .",
    "this is our dominant deviation from ideal behavior , however , we have determined from simulation that compensating for this series loss by a parallel gain has negligible impact on the ideal @xmath0 behavior .",
    "second , additional lf356 op - amps , also used for the negative resistance converter of fig .",
    "[ fig : nics](a ) , are used for voltage followers to buffer the voltages @xmath192 and @xmath193 of fig .",
    "[ fig : basic_dimer ] , allowing for a less intrusive capture with the tektronix dpo2014 oscilloscope used for signal acquisition .",
    "finally , small capacitance and gain trims are included to aid in circuit balancing .",
    "our linearity is constrained by the lf356 op - amps in the negative impedance converters of fig .",
    "[ fig : nics]a . at the @xmath194 operating frequency ,",
    "the limits were consistent with the @xmath195 supply voltage used for the circuit .",
    "in fact , the op - amp linearity limited the overall operation frequency of the dimer : higher frequency op - amps are available , but their linearity and input impedance suffer .",
    "the linear nature of our system allows an exact balance of the @xmath0 symmetry only to the extent that component drift over a time scale necessary to perform a measurement is negligible . in the exact phase ,",
    "real system modes are not perfectly achievable : in time , any physical linear system ultimately either shrinks to zero or exponentially grows to the physical linearity limit . in the case of our dimer ,",
    "component precision and drift dictate the accuracy of the @xmath0 balance to approximately @xmath196 , and all data was obtained respecting the linearity limits and associated transient time scales .",
    "experimental practice allows for only a marginal determination gain / loss balance .",
    "the chosen gain / loss parameter @xmath197 is set by the loss - side resistance @xmath9 of fig .",
    "[ fig : basic_dimer ] , typically in the range @xmath198 for this work . the gain - side @xmath9 and capacitance balance are set with the help of the gain and capacitance trims . in the exact phase , not too close to @xmath32 ,",
    "the system is trimmed for simultaneous marginal oscillation of both modes with growth or decay times greater than @xmath199 , where data is then obtained .",
    "the imaginary frequency component is then zero to within @xmath200 .    very close to the critical point , @xmath201 attempts to trim the dimer to the marginal configuration result in either @xmath202 ( the gain too small ) , or a chaotic interplay of the two modes with the op - amp nonlinearity if the gain is larger .",
    "this behavior serves as one indication that the critical point has been exceeded . in the vicinity of @xmath32 and beyond , the capacitance trim is kept fixed at its asymptotic value , and the gain trim is numerically set to compensate for any measured deviation of the gain side @xmath9 chosen from the desired value .",
    "the exponential growth or decay rate of transient data obtained then directly gives us the imaginary component . beyond the @xmath0 point , the exponentially growing mode always dominates .",
    "at this point , these experimental techniques ultimately impact the limits to which the theory is applicable , particularly in the vicinity of the symmetry breaking point where small imbalances can drastically impact the dynamics .",
    "we anticipate that , due to the stabilizing nature of resistive loads in the form of transmission lines , the @xmath0 dimer will provide many opportunities for incorporation into scattering configurations .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetric dimer opens a new direction towards investigating novel phenomena and functionalities of @xmath0-symmetric systems in the _ spatio - temporal _ domain via electronic circuits .",
    "this minimal example , which is experimentally simple and mathematically transparent , displays all the universal phenomena encountered in systems with generalized @xmath0-symmetries .",
    "the direct accessibility to all the dynamical variables of the system enables insight and a more thorough understanding of generic @xmath0-symmetric behavior .",
    "in addition , we envision new opportunities for inclusion of @xmath0 electronics into structures including ( nano)-antenna configurations , metamaterials , or microresonator arrays with electronic control over directional signal transmission capabilities and real - time manipulation in the spatio - temporal domain .    _",
