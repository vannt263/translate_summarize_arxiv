    "semiclassical periodic orbit quantization is a nontrivial problem for the reason that gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite for chaotic systems and the berry - tabor formula @xcite for integrable systems do not usually converge in those regions where the physical eigenenergies or resonances are located .",
    "various techniques have been developed to circumvent the convergence problem of periodic orbit theory .",
    "examples are the cycle expansion technique @xcite , the riemann - siegel type formula and pseudo - orbit expansions @xcite , surface of section techniques @xcite , and a quantization rule based on a semiclassical approximation to the spectral staircase @xcite .",
    "these specific techniques have proven to be very efficient for individual systems with special properties , e.g. , the cycle expansion for hyperbolic systems with an existing symbolic dynamics .",
    "the other methods mentioned have been used for the calculation of bound spectra of specific systems .",
    "recently , an alternative method based upon filter - diagonalization ( fd ) has been introduced for the analytic continuation of the semiclassical trace formula @xcite .",
    "the fd method requires knowledge of the periodic orbits up to a given maximum period ( classical action ) , which depends on the mean density of states .",
    "the semiclassical eigenenergies or resonances are obtained by _ harmonic inversion _ of the periodic orbit recurrence signal .",
    "the fd method can be generally applied to both open and bound systems and has also proven to be a powerful tool , e.g. , for the calculation of semiclassical transition matrix elements @xcite and the quantization of systems with mixed regular - chaotic phase space @xcite . for a review on periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion see @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present two different techniques to make semiclassical periodic orbit sums convergent .",
    "the first method is an advanced version of harmonic inversion adapted to the special structure of periodic orbit signals given as sums of @xmath0 functions @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical signal , in action or time , corresponds to a `` spectrum '' or response in the frequency domain that is composed of a huge , in principle infinite , number of frequencies . to extract these frequencies and their corresponding amplitudes",
    "is a nontrivial task . in previous work",
    "@xcite the periodic orbit signal has been harmonically inverted by means of fd @xcite which is designed for the analysis of time signals given on an equidistant grid .",
    "the periodic orbit recurrence signal is represented as a sum over usually unevenly spaced @xmath0 functions .",
    "a smooth signal , from which evenly spaced values can be read off , is obtained by a convolution of this sum with , e.g. , a narrow gaussian function .",
    "the disadvantages of this approach are twofold .",
    "firstly , fd acts on this signal more or less like a `` black box '' and , as such , does not lend itself to a detailed understanding of semiclassical periodic orbit quantization .",
    "secondly , the smoothed semiclassical signal usually consists of a huge number of data points .",
    "the handling of such large data sets , together with the smoothing , may lead to significant numerical errors in results for the semiclassical eigenenergies and resonances . here , we propose alternative techniques for the harmonic inversion of the periodic orbit recurrence signal that avoid these problems . in a first step",
    "we create a shortened signal which is constructed from the original signal and designed to be correct only in a window , i.e. , a short frequency range of the total band width .",
    "because the original signal is given as a periodic orbit sum of @xmath0 functions , this `` filtering '' can be performed analytically resulting in a band - limited periodic orbit signal with a relatively small number of equidistant grid points . in a second step the frequencies and amplitudes of the band - limited signal",
    "are determined from a set of nonlinear equations . to solve the nonlinear system , we introduce three different processing methods , viz .",
    "linear predictor ( lp ) , pad approximant ( pa ) , and signal diagonalization ( sd ) .",
    "it is important to note that these processing methods would not have yielded numerically stable solutions if the signal had not first been band - limited by the windowing ( filtering ) procedure .",
    "furthermore , this separation of the harmonic inversion procedure into various steps may elucidate a clearer picture of the periodic orbit quantization method itself , and even provides more accurate results than previous calculations @xcite using fd .",
    "the second method is the direct application of the pad approximant to slowly convergent and/or divergent periodic orbit sums @xcite . in the former or the latter case ,",
    "the pa either significantly increases the convergence rate , or analytically continues the _ exponentially _ divergent series , respectively .",
    "the pa is especially robust for resumming diverging series in many applications in mathematics and theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "an important example is the summation of the divergent rayleigh - schrdinger quantum mechanical perturbation series , e.g. , for atoms in electric @xcite and magnetic @xcite fields . in periodic orbit theory",
    "the pa has been applied to cycle - expanded euler products and dynamical zeta functions @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the pad approximant is applied in both methods in a completely different context , namely , in the first method as a tool for signal processing @xcite , and in the second for the direct summation of the periodic orbit terms in the semiclassical trace formulae .    in sec .",
    "[ method1:sec ] we present our first method to make semiclassical trace formulae convergent .",

    "[ results : sec ] we present and compare results for the three - disk repeller and the circle billiard as physical examples of relevance . a few concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ concl : sec ] .",
    "in order to understand what follows , a brief recapitulation of the basic ideas of periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion may be useful .",
    "for further details see @xcite .    following gutzwiller @xcite",
    "one can write the semiclassical response function for chaotic systems in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a smooth function and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the classical actions and weights ( including phase information given by the maslov index ) of the periodic orbit ( po ) contributions .",
    "equation  ( [ ge_sc ] ) is also valid for integrable systems when the periodic orbit quantities are calculated not with gutzwiller s trace formula , but with the berry - tabor formula @xcite for periodic orbits on rational tori .",
    "the eigenenergies and resonances are the poles of the response function . unfortunately , the semiclassical approximation ( [ ge_sc ] ) does not converge in the region of the poles , and hence one is faced with the problem of the analytic continuation of @xmath5 to this region .    as in previous work @xcite",
    ", we will make the ( weak ) assumption that the classical system has a scaling property , i.e. , the shape of periodic orbits is assumed not to depend on a scaling parameter , @xmath6 , and the classical action scales as @xmath7 in scaling systems , the fluctuating part of the semiclassical response function , @xmath8 can be fourier transformed readily to yield the semiclassical trace of the propagator @xmath9 the signal @xmath10 has @xmath0 spikes at the positions of the classical periods ( scaled actions ) @xmath11 of periodic orbits and with peak heights ( recurrence strengths ) @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath10 is gutzwiller s periodic orbit recurrence function .",
    "consider now the quantum mechanical counterparts of @xmath12 and @xmath10 taken as the sums over the poles @xmath13 of the green s function , @xmath14 @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the residues associated with the eigenvalues .",
    "in the case under study , i.e. , density of states spectra , the @xmath16 are the multiplicities of eigenvalues and are equal to 1 for non - degenerate states .",

    "( [ c_qm ] ) , with the @xmath17 being free , in general complex , frequencies and amplitudes .",
    "this scheme is known as `` harmonic inversion '' .",
    "the numerical procedure of harmonic inversion is a nontrivial task , especially if the number of frequencies in the signal is large ( e.g. , more than a thousand ) , or even infinite as is usually the case for periodic orbit quantization .",
    "note that the conventional way to perform the spectral analysis , i.e. , the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ c_sc ] ) will bring us back to analyzing the non - convergent response function @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ g_sc ] ) . the periodic orbit signal ( [ c_sc ] )",
    "can be harmonically inverted by application of fd @xcite , which allows one to calculate a finite and relatively small set of frequencies and amplitudes in a given frequency window .",
    "the usual implementation of fd requires knowledge of the signal on an equidistant grid .",
    "the signal ( [ c_sc ] ) is not a continuous function .",
    "however , a smooth signal can be obtained by a convolution of @xmath10 with , e.g. , a gaussian function , @xmath18 as can easily be seen , the convolution results in a damping of the amplitudes , @xmath19 .",
    "the width @xmath20 of the gaussian function should be chosen sufficiently small to avoid an overly strong damping of amplitudes . to properly sample each gaussian a dense grid with steps",
    "@xmath21 is required .",
    "therefore , the signal ( [ c_sc_sigma ] ) analyzed by fd usually consists of a large number of data points .",
    "the numerical treatment of this large data set may suffer from rounding errors and loss of accuracy .",
    "additionally , the `` black box '' type procedure of harmonic inversion by fd , which intertwines windowing and processing , does not provide any opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of semiclassical periodic orbit quantization .",
    "it is therefore desirable to separate the harmonic inversion procedure into two sequential steps : firstly , the filtering procedure that does not require smoothing and , secondly , a procedure for extracting the frequencies and amplitudes . in sec .",
    "[ analyt_dec : sec ] we will construct , by analytic filtering , a band - limited signal which consists of a relatively small number of frequencies . in sec .",
    "[ hi : sec ] we will present methods to extract the frequencies and amplitudes of such band - limited signals .      in general , a frequency filter can be applied to a given signal by application of the fourier transform @xcite .",
    "the signal is transformed to the frequency domain , e.g. , by application of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) method .",
    "the transformed signal is multiplied with a frequency filter function @xmath22 localized around a central frequency , @xmath23 .",
    "the frequency filter @xmath22 can be rather general , typical examples are a rectangular window or a gaussian function .",
    "the filtered signal is then shifted by @xmath24 and transformed back to the time domain by a second application of fft .",
    "the filtered signal consists of a significantly reduced set of frequencies , and therefore a reduced set of grid points is sufficient for the analysis of the signal .",

    "<S> periodic orbit quantization requires an analytic continuation of non - convergent semiclassical trace formulae . </S>",
    "<S> we propose two different methods for semiclassical quantization . </S>",
    "<S> the first method is based upon the harmonic inversion of semiclassical recurrence functions . </S>",
    "<S> a band - limited periodic orbit signal is obtained by analytical frequency windowing of the periodic orbit sum . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies of the periodic orbit signal are the semiclassical eigenvalues , and are determined by either linear predictor , pad approximant , or signal diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> the second method is based upon the direct application of the pad approximant to the periodic orbit sum . </S>",
    "<S> the pad approximant allows the resummation of the , typically exponentially , divergent periodic orbit terms . </S>",
    "<S> both techniques do not depend on the existence of a symbolic dynamics , and can be applied to bound as well as to open systems . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are presented for two different systems with chaotic and regular classical dynamics , viz .  the three - disk scattering system and the circle billiard . </S>"
