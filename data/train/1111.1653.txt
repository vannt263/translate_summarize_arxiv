    "the concept of pumping in nanosystems @xcite has emerged from the paradigm of peristaltic pumps , simple idealized devices moving mass and/or charge in a defined direction as two or more parameters are cycled through a closed path @xcite . as long as the driving is considered slow ,",

    "this enormously fruitful idea allows for a very general analytical treatment involving quantum scattering theory and berry phases and has inspired a wide range of experimental realizations , including semiconductor nanostructures , e.g. , quantum dots driven by time - dependent gate voltages and more recently graphene sheets .",
    "stimulated in turn by these developments , theoretical approaches have been extended towards quantum pumps with fast and strong driving , leaving the adiabatic regime  largely equivalent to linear response @xcite  far behind @xcite , as well as towards including realistic many - body effects like dissipation and charge blocking .    by contrast , aspects of complex dynamics involved in directed transport in strongly driven pumps have not yet been explored in depth . from the point of view of ballistic classical motion ,",
    "peristaltic pumping amounts to a trivial dynamics of the transported particles , moving phase - space volumes through the device much like a viscous liquid . as sufficiently coherent and controllable sources of ever faster drivings approaching",
    "the thz regime become available , pumping in the realm of nonadiabatic and strongly nonlinear dynamics comes within reach .",
    "scattering theory , already at the heart of quantum pumping , provides us with an appropriate theoretical framework which has developed far beyond the adiabatic regime : irregular scattering @xcite is a mature field with numerous applications from celestial mechanics @xcite down to chemical reactions @xcite , comprising classical as well as quantum phenomena and approaches .    with this work",
    ", we attempt a first survey into pumps operating in the regime of chaotic scattering and to give an overview of their principal features . as concerns implications for directed transport of the nonlinear dynamics induced by fast and strong forcing",
    ", there exists a pertinent case to be followed : the concept of chaotic ratchets @xcite , in particular classical hamiltonian ones amenable to direct quantization , has stimulated important insights into conditions and mechanisms of directed transport and its quantum manifestations in this regime .",
    "similarly , based on a comparable body of results available on scattering at strongly driven potentials @xcite , we will point out peculiarities of pumping due to a complex dynamics , such as currents violating linear response @xcite and the possibility to achieve transport with a single driven parameter .",
    "conversely , the field of irregular scattering gets enriched by considerations around symmetry breaking @xcite and finds new applications with significant technological perspectives such as the generation of polarized ( pure spin ) currents @xcite . focusing on dynamical aspects ,",
    "we however abstain from considering many - body effects in this work .    in the first , classical part of the paper , we devise a family of elementary one - dimensional models , consisting of square potential wells which allow for two- as well as single - parameter driving , and analyze directed transport in these systems in terms of phase - space structures . the quantum part briefly reviews floquet scattering theory as basic theoretical tool and provides numerical evidence , obtained from wavepacket scattering , for directed currents largely owing to the complex underlying classical motion .",
    "the concluding section provides an outlook to a number of questions left open by our work .",
