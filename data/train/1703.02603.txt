    "quantum random walks @xcite or quantum walks ( qw ) have been widely investigated opening new branches of research in physics , computational science and engineering @xcite .",
    "they offer insights for building quantum search algorithms @xcite , understanding the photosynthesis efficiency @xcite , performing universal computation @xcite , simulating dirac - like hamiltonians @xcite and they can be implemented in several experimental platforms @xcite .",
    "qw are the quantum analogues of classical random walks , in which the superposition effects emerge , since distinct possibilities of paths can interfere between them",
    ". these effects dramatically change the spreading behavior , leading to a quadratic gain in its dispersion ( ballistic behavior ) .",
    "moreover , since the quantum walker is a qubit , a two - state system ( spin ) spread over position states , its dynamic evolution creates entanglement between these internal and external degrees of freedom .    the entanglement in qw has a strong dependence on their initial conditions . the maximal entanglement is reached asymptotically and only for one specific initial spin condition for local initial position state @xcite or also , for any initial state through the introduction of any kind of dynamic disorder along the walk @xcite .",
    "there are few papers about the spreading of qw from delocalized initial conditions @xcite and their entanglement behavior @xcite .",
    "our main focus here is the impact of the delocalization in qw over their asymptotic entanglement , in this way this article is organized as follows . in secs .",
    "[ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] , we review the qw in position and momentum space and the quantification of the entanglement in both spaces . in the sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we calculate a general expression for the asymptotic entanglement . in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we obtain the asymptotic entanglement from local and delocalized states ( gaussian and rectangular states ) , we show a way to connect both kinds of asymptotic entanglements and we confront our analytical results with numerical calculations . finally , in the last section the discussion and conclusion are pictured .",
    "the quantum walker state @xmath0 belongs to a hilbert space @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a single qubit coin space , a two - dimensional complex vector space spanned by the spin states @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the position space , an infinite - dimensional enumerable vector space spanned by a set of orthonormal vectors @xmath5 where the integer @xmath6 is the discrete position of the qubit on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "thus , a general initial state is @xmath7\\otimes\\ket{j } , \\label{psi_0}\\ ] ] with @xmath8=1 $ ] as the normalization condition and the sum is over all integers .",
    "the time evolution of a qw is written as , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the time evolution operator , where @xmath11 is the identity in @xmath4 and @xmath12 is the quantum coin .",
    "the quantum coin acts over the spin states and generates a superposition of them . here",
    ", we employ the hadamard , widely used as a quantum coin , @xmath13 the conditional displacement operator @xmath14 moves the qubit to the right or left conditioned to its internal state , i.e. , from site @xmath6 to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) if its spin is up ( down ) , which creates entanglement between spin and position along the time evolution .",
    "the total initial state @xmath17 is pure and since the time evolution is unitary , @xmath18 remains pure .",
    "this fact allows us to quantify the entanglement between spin and position by means of von neumann entropy @xmath19 , of the partially reduced coin ( spin ) state @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the trace over the positions .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 due to the normalization condition and @xmath27 is the complex conjugate of @xmath28 .",

    "ranges from @xmath33 for separable states up to @xmath34 for maximal entanglement condition .",
    "to quantify the entanglement in the asymptotic limit for @xmath35 , we need to consider the dual k - space @xmath36 spanned by the fourier transformed vectors @xmath37 with @xmath38 $ ] , where the initial state is , @xmath39\\otimes\\ket{k } , \\label{psitil_0}\\ ] ] and the corresponding initial amplitudes are @xmath40    the time evolution operator @xmath41 can be rewritten as , @xmath42 once the conditional displacement operator @xmath43 is diagonal in the fourier representation , @xmath44 .",
    "let us introduce the state @xmath45 , such that the one - step time evolution is @xmath46 . by calculating the eigenvectors of @xmath47",

    "therefore , calculating the integrals @xmath57 and inserting them into , we have the entanglement as function of the amplitudes in the momentum space .",

    "the asymptotic entanglement , on the other hand , can be straightforward calculated by fourier analysis as showed above .",
    "however , what is the general behavior of the entanglement along the time evolution ?",
    "how many steps are necessary to be close enough to the asymptotic entanglement ? in order to enlighten these questions , in this section , firstly we perform a numerical simulation of the average entanglement @xmath118 along the time for all cases .",

    "fitting the asymptotic curve ( red ) gives us a @xmath135 decay , @xmath136 for gaussian case and a @xmath84 decay , @xmath137 for rectangular case , both obtained by means of numerical integration .",
    "some experimental realizations of qw have been successfully performed in the last ten years through schemes based on the interferometry @xcite and the manipulation of the photonic orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite .",
    "the interferometric platforms demand a large number of optical components for many time steps , however the oam based platforms seem to be promising , since they manipulate the photonic oam from a unique light beam , without reflexions or refractions . in this case , the external degree of freedom related to @xmath138 gives place to the @xmath139 which represents the z - component of the photonic oam .",
    "the internal degree of freedom is determined by the left or right circular polarization of twisted photons , which is manipulated by an inhomogeneous and anisotropic birefringent crystal , named _q - plate_ @xcite . in this context",
    ", initial states can be chosen through the eigenstates ( or superposition of ) varying the quasimomentum @xmath140 to establish different values of group velocity @xcite .",
    "since the choice of a specific @xmath140 as initial state naturally implies delocalization on the position ( oam ) space , it becomes an interesting platform to use delocalization to achieve maximal entanglement .",
    "the main aspect emphasised here is the importance of delocalization of the initial state as a positive aspect regarding the generation of entanglement .",
    "we have obtained the asymptotic entanglement for local and two kind of delocalized states , as well as a way to connect them through analytical and numerical analysis .",
    "for delocalized states , we found out a simple relation between the initial phases of the qubit , which always leads to the maximal entanglement .",
    "this result expands our knowledge on maximal entanglement achievement from one specific spin state ( local ) up to a continuous set of initial spin states ( delocalized ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the delocalized qw have ballistic spreading since their evolution is ordered , as opposed to the diffusive behavior for disordered scenarios @xcite .",
