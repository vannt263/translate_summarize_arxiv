    "nine decades ago , lense and thirring considered the motion of a free test mass in the stationary exterior gravitational field of a rotating astronomical source within the framework of general relativity @xcite .",
    "they treated the influence of the gravitomagnetic field on the particle orbit via the lagrange planetary equations and showed by means of linear perturbation theory that  when averaged over the fast keplerian motion ",
    "the orbit keeps its shape and slowly precesses .",
    "specifically , they found that the semimajor axis @xmath0 of the osculating ellipse does not change , while its eccentricity @xmath1 and orbital inclination @xmath2 contain periodic terms that vanish on the average ; moreover , the osculating ellipse precesses .",
    "this occurs both within the orbital plane of the osculating ellipse and without , as the orbital plane precesses about the axis of rotation of the central source .",
    "the frequency of both precessions can be described by @xmath3.\\ ] ] here , @xmath4 is the constant angular momentum of the source , @xmath5 is a unit vector parallel to the orbital angular momentum of the osculating ellipse and @xmath6 . thus the runge - lenz vector and the orbital angular momentum vector of the osculating ellipse both precess with the lense - thirring frequency .",
    "astronomical bodies in general rotate ; however , the magnitude of the proper angular momentum is seldom constant .",
    "in two recent papers @xcite , the gravitational physics around a rotating central source whose spin angular momentum vector is fixed in space but varies linearly in time has been explored . in particular , it has been shown in @xcite that sufficiently far from such a source , the spacetime metric is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic potentials , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 is the mass of the source and its angular momentum is given by @xmath11 moreover , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath14 , @xmath15 and all @xmath16 contributions to the metric tensor have been neglected in this linear post - newtonian approach to general relativity . as explained in @xcite",
    ", we simply ignore the processes by which the variation of angular momentum is turned on and off and assume that equation holds throughout the temporal interval of interest ; furthermore , all radiative effects are neglected .",
    "the motion of a free test particle in the gravitational field of the source is given by the geodesic equation in the spacetime with metric .",
    "this equation , as shown in @xcite , can be written in its reduced form @xmath17 + \\frac{2g}{c^2 } \\frac{\\dot{\\mathbf{j } } \\times \\mathbf{x}}{r^3 } -\\frac{2}{c}\\mathbf{v } \\times \\mathbf{b}\\\\ & { } -\\frac{6gj(t)}{c^4r^5 } [ \\hat{\\mathbf{j } } \\cdot ( \\mathbf{x}\\times \\mathbf{v } ) ] ( \\mathbf{x}\\cdot \\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{v},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where an overdot represents differentiation with respect to time @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the gravitomagnetic field given by @xmath20    the right - hand side of contains all of the linear post - newtonian contributions that arise from potentials given in .",
    "it turns out , however , that in a general treatment to @xmath21 , the nonlinear gravitoelectric term @xmath22 , which is quadratic in @xmath23 and hence absent in our linear treatment , should also be taken into account . in the present work ,",
    "we explore further the influence of the temporal variation of @xmath24 on motion around a central rotating source to first post - newtonian order , namely , @xmath21 .",
    "thus instead of , we consider @xmath25 + \\frac{4g^2m^2}{c^2r^4 } \\mathbf{x}+\\frac{2g}{c^2 } \\frac{\\dot{\\mathbf{j}}\\times \\mathbf{x}}{r^3 } -\\frac{2}{c}\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{b}. \\label{eq:8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as demonstrated in @xcite , equation represents the metric of a nonstationary linearized kerr spacetime .",
    "the geodesic equation in kerr spacetime is completely integrable @xcite ; more recent results are contained , for instance , in @xcite and references therein .",
    "to gain insight into the nature of allowed orbits , it proves useful to study first certain simple configurations . for instance , it has been shown in @xcite that _ circular _ equatorial orbits are unstable due to the temporal variation of @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore look for _ spherical _ orbits in this section .",
    "it will turn out that the post - newtonian equations of motion and do not allow spherical orbits unless @xmath26 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the spherical orbits can be concisely characterized as describing a post - keplerian circular orbit undergoing lense - thirring precession .",
    "we will then investigate the instability of spherical orbits under the slow temporal variation of @xmath24 .      to investigate spherical orbits , it is convenient to write and in spherical polar coordinates @xmath27 such that @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in terms of the corresponding unit vectors",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , one can write @xmath34 , @xmath35 moreover , it follows from that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 thus the post - newtonian equations of motion are @xmath38    it is interesting to note that may be written as @xmath39 = \\frac{4gm}{c^2 } r\\dot{r}\\dot{\\phi}\\sin ^2\\theta .\\ ] ] thus an integral of the motion is obtained if the right - hand side of vanishes .",
    "we therefore look for spherical orbits @xmath40 such that @xmath41 is a constant .",
    "it follows from that for a spherical orbit @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant of integration . substituting in and , and keeping terms only up to @xmath21 , we find @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "these equations are compatible only if @xmath26 .",
    "thus let @xmath47 and define the positive constant @xmath48 such that @xmath49    to find the motion in @xmath50 , we note that can be written as @xmath51 which has solutions only for @xmath52 ; in this case , we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a constant phase .",
    "it is possible to let @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath2 is a constant ( `` inclination '' ) angle .",
    "then the solution of may be expressed as @xmath59+\\varphi_0,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is an integration constant .",
    "let us note that with @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the keplerian frequency , we have @xmath63 only positive square roots are considered throughout .",
    "the explicit solution for spherical orbits in the first post - newtonian approximation is contained in and .",
    "spherical orbits in kerr spacetime have been considered in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that when @xmath64 in and , a spherical orbit simply reduces to a circular orbit of radius @xmath41 and frequency @xmath65 about mass @xmath10 such that the orbital angular momentum vector makes an angle of @xmath2 with the @xmath66 axis .",
    "thus one can characterize the spherical orbits under consideration as circular orbits in the post - newtonian gravitational field of mass @xmath10 that undergo lense - thirring precession due to the presence of the constant angular momentum of the source @xmath67 .",
    "we now let @xmath68 with @xmath69 and consider the solution of equations - to linear order of perturbation beyond an arbitrary spherical orbit .",
    "thus let @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are all of @xmath21 and depend linearly upon @xmath74 . substituting in the equations of motion , we find @xmath75 here , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a dimensionless integration constant .",
    "while equations and have been respectively obtained directly from and , equation is obtained from , since the right - hand side of this equation vanishes under our perturbation conditions .",
    "substituting for @xmath78 in and using leads to @xmath79 g+4\\ddot{\\vartheta } f+2\\dot{\\vartheta}\\dot{f } = 2r_0\\ddot{\\vartheta}.\\label{eq:33}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    inspection of equations   and reveals that they have the following solutions : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an integration constant . with these formulas for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , can be simply integrated and the result is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is another constant of integration .",
    "it is possible to assume that @xmath86 without any loss in generality . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath87 ; then , it is straightforward to demonstrate , using equations   and - , that the resulting orbit @xmath27 is simply a new _ spherical _ orbit of constant radius @xmath88 .",
    "it follows that one can set the dimensionless constants @xmath77 , @xmath81 and @xmath85 equal to zero with no loss in generality .",
    "then , the perturbation @xmath89 due to @xmath69 is clearly secular leading to the instability of spherical orbits ; in fact , these orbits spiral outward for @xmath90 and inward for @xmath91 .",
    "these results provide independent confirmation of the some of the conclusions regarding perturbations of keplerian orbits presented in @xcite , since a spherical orbit in the present treatment is simply a lense - thirring precessing circular orbit . a detailed investigation verifies this correspondence for the secular terms .",
    "we note , in this connection , that for @xmath87 , the perturbed circular keplerian orbit in @xcite differs from a spherical orbit by a harmonic term in the radial perturbation  see equation ( 71 ) of @xcite .",
    "finally , let us remark that the speed of the motion along the perturbed orbit is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the speed of the unperturbed spherical orbit @xmath94 it follows from that the motion is slower for @xmath90 and faster for @xmath95 .",
    "this confirms one of the main results of @xcite by a completely different analysis . on these physical grounds",
    ", we expect that our special solution contains the _ dominant _ secular terms of the general solution of the linear perturbation equations .",
    "we turn now to the gravitomagnetic perturbations of keplerian ellipses , first treated in general by lense and thirring  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we extend their analysis to take into account the temporal variation of the gravitomagnetic field .",
    "the method that we employ here is not a generalization of the approach developed in the previous section for circular orbits .",
    "that is , rather than directly perturbing a lense - thirring precessing keplerian ellipse , we follow , for the sake of simplicity , the linear perturbation method of lense and thirring @xcite in the case of @xmath96 .",
    "it is possible to express the three second - order equations of motion in terms of six first - order lagrange planetary equations @xcite .",
    "if at any instant of time @xmath18 the perturbing force @xmath97 is turned off , the test particle follows an osculating keplerian ellipse about the central source .",
    "thus instead of the position and velocity of the particle at time @xmath18 , the state of the particle can be equally well characterized by the six orbital elements of the osculating ellipse at time @xmath18 .",
    "the motion can therefore be described in terms of the evolution of the parameters of the instantaneous osculating ellipse .",
    "these parameters can be chosen in various ways ; we employ the delaunay action - angle variables @xmath98 given by @xcite @xmath99^{1/2},\\quad \\tilde{h}=\\tilde{g}\\cos i,\\\\ \\eqalign{\\tilde{\\ell } = u - e\\sin u,\\quad \\tilde{g}=\\mbox{argument of the pericenter},\\cr \\quad \\tilde{h}=\\mbox{longitude of the ascending node}.\\label{eq:40}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath0 is the semimajor axis of the osculating ellipse , @xmath1 is its eccentricity , @xmath2 is the orbital inclination , @xmath100 is the eccentric anomaly and @xmath101 is the mean anomaly .",
    "the quantity @xmath102 is the magnitude of the specific orbital angular momentum vector @xmath103 , while its @xmath66-component is denoted by @xmath104 .",
    "moreover , the radial position of the test particle along the osculating ellipse is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the true anomaly .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath107,\\\\ \\fl \\frac{d\\tilde{g}}{dt } = rf_s,\\label{eq:43}\\\\ \\fl \\frac{d\\tilde{h}}{dt } = r[f_s \\cos i - f_n \\sin i\\cos ( \\tilde{v}+\\tilde{g})],\\label{eq:44}\\\\ \\fl \\frac{d\\tilde{\\ell}}{dt } = \\omega_k + \\frac{r}{\\omega_ka^2e } [ f_r ( -2e+\\cos \\tilde{v}+e\\cos ^2\\tilde{v } ) -f_s ( 2+e\\cos \\tilde{v})\\sin \\tilde{v } ] , \\label{eq:45}\\\\ \\fl \\frac{d\\tilde{g}}{dt } = -\\frac{rf_n}{\\tilde{g } } \\cot i\\sin ( \\tilde{v } + \\tilde{g})+\\frac{(1-e^2)^{1/2}}{\\omega_kae}\\left ( -f_r \\cos \\tilde{v } + f_s \\frac{2+e\\cos \\tilde{v}}{1+e\\cos \\tilde{v } } \\sin \\tilde{v}\\right),\\label{eq:46}\\\\ \\fl \\frac{d\\tilde{h}}{dt } = \\frac{rf_n}{\\tilde{g } } \\frac{\\sin ( \\tilde{v}+\\tilde{g})}{\\sin i } , \\label{eq:47}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the keplerian frequency is given by @xmath108 . here",
    ", the perturbing force is given in terms of its radial , sideways and normal components , @xmath109 that is , @xmath31 is the radial unit vector as before , @xmath110 and @xmath5 is given by @xmath111 ; hence , @xmath31 and @xmath112 are in the plane of the osculating ellipse , while @xmath5 is normal to it .    to find the components of the perturbing force , it is useful to recall that the position vector of the test particle along the osculating ellipse has components @xmath113,\\\\ y = r[\\sin \\tilde{h } \\cos ( \\tilde{v } + \\tilde{g } ) + \\cos \\tilde{h } \\cos i \\sin ( \\tilde{v } + \\tilde{g})],\\label{eq:50}\\\\ z = r\\sin i\\sin ( \\tilde{v}+\\tilde{g}),\\label{eq:51}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while its velocity is given by @xmath114 furthermore , with respect to the background @xmath115 coordinate system @xmath116    the perturbing force contains small relativistic terms and in our perturbation scheme the influence of these perturbing accelerations are simply additive .",
    "therefore , we will ignore the post - newtonian gravitoelectric terms in @xmath97 and concentrate instead on the gravitomagnetic terms , namely , @xmath117 we find that @xmath118,\\label{eq:57}\\\\ \\fl f'_n = -\\frac{2g\\sin i}{c^2r^2 } \\big\\ { j_1 \\cos ( \\tilde{v } + \\tilde{g})+(j_0 + j_1t)\\frac{gm}{r\\tilde{g } } [ e\\sin \\tilde{g } - ( 2 + 3e\\cos \\tilde{v } ) \\sin ( \\tilde{v}+\\tilde{g})]\\big\\}.\\label{eq:58}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with these perturbing functions , we can simply integrate - following the linear perturbation approach adopted by lense and thirring  @xcite .",
    "that is , we regard the orbital elements appearing on the right - hand side of the equations of motion as constants and employ @xmath119 for the osculating ellipse at time @xmath18 ; in fact , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are obtained from @xmath122 assuming , for the sake of simplicity , that @xmath123 at @xmath124 , we find @xmath125 the integration of the equations of motion is now straightforward ; we recover the lense - thirring results for @xmath67 and find new terms proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "the latter terms are generally secular , of course , and render the lense - thirring precessions time - dependent . in connection with orbital instability ,",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to the secular variation of @xmath126 , which remained on average unchanged in the lense - thirring treatment .",
    "it follows from that @xmath127 which can be integrated using and the result is @xmath128 thus the semimajor axis and hence the newtonian energy of the osculating ellipse will have a secular variation in time depending upon the sign of @xmath129 , so that essentially all orbits are unstable for @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , from @xmath130 , and , we find that the change in eccentricity is given by @xmath131 + \\frac{2j_1\\cos i}{mc^2 } \\delta i',\\ ] ] where @xmath132 these integrals contain secular terms .",

    "we note that @xmath149 is proportional to @xmath150 , so that an equatorial orbit stays in the equatorial plane . in equations   and ,",
    "the part proportional to @xmath67 contains only harmonic terms , while the part proportional to @xmath74 contains secular terms . for @xmath151 , the secular term that is independent of the eccentricity in",
    "is given by the variation of @xmath152    to further illustrate orbital instability , we integrate numerically the equations of motion for an initially eccentric keplerian ellipse . in practice , it turns out to be simpler to integrate equation  where @xmath97 is now replaced by @xmath153 given in with initial position and velocity given by  . moreover , we employ the equations of motion in dimensionless form , so that all lengths are given in units of @xmath154 , the initial semimajor axis , while time is given in units of @xmath155 , the inverse of the initial keplerian frequency .",
    "the equations of motion then depend on two dimensionless parameters @xmath156    for the numerical results illustrated in figure 1 , we choose @xmath157 .",
    "this corresponds approximately to an initial orbit of semimajor axis @xmath158 km around a neutron star of mass @xmath159 and radius @xmath160 km with a proper rotation period of a millisecond .",
    "furthermore , we choose @xmath161 , so that after about 1600 keplerian periods , the angular momentum of the source decreases to zero . the integration is carried out for @xmath162 such that @xmath163 .",
    "this relatively rapid decrease of angular momentum has been adopted here for the sake of illustration ; in fact , neutron stars generally lose angular momentum very slowly due to electromagnetic braking torques . in figure 1 , we plot @xmath164 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the speed of the motion @xmath141 versus @xmath165 . for the initial conditions at @xmath123 and @xmath166",
    ", we choose @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "the initial eccentricity is chosen to be @xmath170 ; based on our numerical work , similar results are expected for other initial eccentricities . the simple linear behavior of @xmath171 depicted in the first panel of figure 1 can be obtained from ; that is , for @xmath172 , equation implies that @xmath173 in agreement with our numerical results .",
    "the second and third panels of figure 1 depict the oscillatory character of the eccentricity and the inclination angle , respectively , as the angular momentum of the source monotonically decreases from @xmath67 to @xmath174 . the midpoint of integration when @xmath175 is a prominent feature of these graphs .",
    "in fact , the amplitudes of the quasi - periodic oscillations appear to be proportional to @xmath24",
    ". moreover , the inclination angle @xmath2 tends to oscillate _ toward _ the angular momentum vector of the source @xmath176 . as indicated by our extensive numerical work , and is evident from the last three panels of figure 1 , we have to expect complexity in the details of the motion , which is probably chaotic ; therefore , only the overall trends are meaningful here .",
    "the last panel confirms the expectation that for @xmath177 , @xmath141 on the average has an increasing trend with time , in general agreement with equation for the circular case .",
    "that is , for @xmath178 ( @xmath177 ) , the orbit generally tends to spiral outward ( inward ) accompanied by a corresponding decrease ( increase ) in its average speed .",
    "we have studied the instability of bound keplerian orbits induced by a time - varying gravitomagnetic field in the post - newtonian approximation .",
    "circular and elliptical orbits have been treated separately in sections  [ s2 ] and [ s3 ] , respectively .",
    "the results are expected to be of interest in the study of variable collapsed astrophysical systems .",
