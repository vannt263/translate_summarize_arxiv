    "the ability to control ultra - cold atom - atom interactions has opened the door to a wide variety of fundamental and applied studies , including the production of ultra - cold molecules @xcite , simulations of condensed matter phenomena @xcite , and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the tools that have been central to this development include designer atom traps , for example , optical lattices @xcite , and controllable scattering resonances such as a magnetic feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "both of these can be used to manipulate the two - body scattering process , thus affecting the strength of the interaction , the nature of the resulting two - body states , and more general many - body phenomena .",
    "examples include confinement - induced resonances @xcite , bound - states with repulsive interactions @xcite , and feshbach resonances in band structures @xcite .",
    "a particular example that we have explored previously is a trap - induced resonance ( tir ) that occurs as a result of interaction between atoms that are confined to spatially separated harmonic traps @xcite .",
    "this happens as a consequence of a molecular bound state that becomes resonant with the vibrational state of the separated atoms due to a quadratic rise in the light shift when the two atoms approach one another , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "a strong resonance can occur when the confinement of the wave packet in the trap is on the order of ( or smaller than ) the free - space scattering length .",
    "this @xmath2-wave resonance is analogous to a higher - partial wave shape resonance occurring in free space , but here the tunneling barrier arises from the trap rather than from an angular momentum centrifugal barrier . because of this tunneling , the interaction occurs at  negative energy \" values with respect to the free - particle @xmath2-wave scattering threshold .        in previous work on the tir in cesium @xcite , whose large scattering length gives rise to a strong resonance , stock _ et al .",

    "such a procedure has limited utility ; the solutions are unstable since the wave function blows up in the tunneling barrier .",
    "the situation gets very complicated as soon as there is more than one channel .",
    "a proper numerical technique must ensure that open channels are propagated along with the exponentially decaying closed channels while maintaining accuracy to relevant digits .",
    "most coupled channel codes that incorporate such situations ( i.e. propagating closed and open channels ) , eventually drop the closed channels beyond certain radius since they are only interested in open channels . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of tir considered in this paper requires us to integrate to large enough radius for determining a good asymptotic log derivative ( for both open and closed channels ) .",
    "we emphasize that we are not allowed to drop any channels , since in the end , we are required to extract the asymptotic log derivatives for both open as well as closed channels .",
    "to remedy this , we consider here _ analytic models _ of the multichannel @xmath0-matrix .",
    "simplified analytic models have been employed in previous studies of ultra - cold collisions and scattering resonances .",
    "julienne and gao have predicted the properties of feshbach resonances based on the analytic properties of the van der waals long range potential @xcite .",
    "have used analytic models to describe the interplay of open and closed channels in the context of feshbach resonances associated with a large background scattering length @xcite .",
    "these analytic models , while simple in nature , are able to encapsulate the necessary physics in just a few parameters .",
    "these parameters can then be incorporated into building model many - body hamiltonians , an example being the two - channel model used for describing resonance superfluidity in a two component fermi gas @xcite .",

    "this is a non - trivial task , however , since there is a huge separation of length scales between the molecular potential and the external trapping potential , and the displacement of the trap from the zero of the relative - coordinate makes the system anisotropic .",

    "the lowest energy eigenstates drops below the threshold of the molecular potential .",
    "thus the  negative energy \" scattering states that are inaccessible in free space , become opened by the trapping potential .",

    "[ rvalues ] .",
    "a resonance exists at @xmath19 @xmath12k ( here and throughout , energy is measured in temperature units ) due to a bound state very close to zero energy .",
    "finding the scattering length at negative energies via equivalent numerical integration is highly unstable , as the wave function blows up in the classically forbidden region .",
    "even if one manages to do it , it is necessary that the integration be sufficiently stable for large @xmath20 , well into the asymptotic region of the potential , in order to extract a meaningful scattering length @xcite .",
    "in addition , because we are in the neighborhood of a scattering resonance near zero energy , the strong variation of the scattering length with energy makes the requirement for a robust numerical solution even more demanding . to address these problems , we develop analytic models that will allow us to calculate the scattering matrix below threshold . in doing so",
    ", we will extend the method to a more complicated process that occurs for the multichannel scattering case .",
    "near - threshold scattering is dominated by resonant phenomena .",
    "such resonances can arise from a variety of different physical mechanisms , and thereby affect the form of the analytic model .",
    "we identify the nature of the resonance based on our understanding of the physical processes and the location of the poles in the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "away from resonance , the scattering properties are smooth functions and therefore can be modeled by a few free parameters .",
    "the total @xmath0-matrix thus factors into resonant and background contributions , @xmath21     for @xmath2-wave scattering on the @xmath5 channel .",

    "a direct numerical integration gives a bound state with a binding energy @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the resonant part of the single channel @xmath0-matrix can be written as @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , representing a pole of the @xmath0-matrix in the @xmath26-plane on the positive imaginary axis .",
    "there is no need to single out the other bound states , as they are energetically too far away , and their effect is absorbed in the background part .",
    "this remaining part can be written in the low energy limit @xmath27 as , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the background scattering length that encapsulates the effect of all other non - resonant processes , including other deeply bound states .",
    "now we can write the complete @xmath0-matrix element analytically with just one free parameter , @xmath29 , the value of which can be determined by fitting one positive low energy point to the equation @xmath30 in fig .",

    "( [ linearphase ] ) .",
    "we see good agreement at low energy but for energies beyond 10 @xmath12k a slight difference is noticed .",
    "this is expected since the linear form of the background phase shift is only valid at low energies . to remedy this problem",
    ", we use a higher order expansion for the background part given by @xmath31 where we have added an additional free parameter , @xmath32 , the effective range . as before , we determine both the parameters by fitting two low energy data points . the inset of fig .",

    "we now turn to a more complex situation : collisions between @xmath35 and @xmath36 or the @xmath37 channel .",
    "this is motivated by the following experimental considerations .",
    "controlled collisions via spin - dependent transport in polarization gradient optical lattices @xcite is hampered by inhomogeneous broadening arising from unwanted real or fictitious magnetic fields ( due to elliptically polarized light at the atomic position ) @xcite .",
    "this is a particularly deleterious effect for the @xmath5 states that see a strongly varying difference in their optical potentials along the transport . in a lin - angle - lin optical lattice at very large detunings , atoms in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 states",
    "experience almost the same shift due to the fictitious magnetic field .",
    "any residual broadening is due to the finite detuning effects ( giving a differential scalar light shift ) and the true magnetic field inhomogeneity .",
    "controlled collisions in the @xmath37 channel thus offer the advantage of higher degrees of coherence , with potential applications to quantum information processing .    to treat scattering with the incoming @xmath37 channel ,",
    "we must account for the exchange interaction , which leads to spin - changing collisions that preserve the total projection of angular momentum along a quantization axis . in this case , the @xmath2-wave collisions couple the @xmath37 channel to the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 channels . at low energies , small",
    "compared to the hyperfine splitting , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are energetically closed . moreover , in the presence of any positive magnetic field @xmath44 , the channel @xmath40 shifts to a higher energy compared to the @xmath37 channel , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ potschematic ] . for energies that are smaller than this shift , @xmath40 channel is also closed .",
    "the movement of this channel from below to above the threshold can lead to a feshbach resonance that strongly affects the scattering process , as discussed below .    .",

    "<S> we construct simple analytic models of the @xmath0-matrix , accounting for both scattering resonances and smooth background contributions for collisions that occur below the s - wave threshold . </S>",
    "<S> such models are important for studying confinement - induced resonances such as those occurring in cold collisions of @xmath1cs atoms in separated sites of a polarization - gradient optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> because these resonances occur at negative energy with respect to the @xmath2-wave threshold , they can not be studied easily using direct numerical solutions of the schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> using our analytic model , we extend previous studies of negative - energy scattering to the multichannel case , accounting for the interplay of feshbach resonances , large background scattering lengths , and inelastic processes . </S>"
