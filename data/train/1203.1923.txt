    "dynamical dark matter ( ddm )  @xcite is a new framework for dark - matter physics in which the requirement of stability is replaced by a delicate balancing between lifetimes and cosmological abundances across a vast ensemble of individual dark - matter components . due to the range of lifetimes and abundances of these components",
    ", their collective behavior transcends that normally associated with traditional dark - matter candidates .",
    "in particular , quantities such as the total dark - matter relic abundance , the proportional composition of the ensemble in terms of its constituents , and the effective equation of state for the ensemble possess a non - trivial time dependence beyond that associated with the expansion of the universe . indeed , from this perspective , ddm may be viewed as the most general possible framework for dark - matter physics , and traditional dark - matter models are merely a limiting case of the ddm framework in which the states which compose the dark sector are taken to be relatively few in number and therefore stable .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we laid out the general theoretical features of the ddm framework .",
    "by contrast , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we presented an explicit realization of the ddm framework : a model in which the particles which constitute the dark - matter ensemble are the kk excitations of an axion - like field propagating in the bulk of large extra spacetime dimensions .",
    "we demonstrated that this model has all of the features necessary to constitute a viable realization of the general ddm framework . in this paper",
    ", we complete our study by performing a general analysis of all phenomenological constraints which are relevant to this bulk - axion ddm model .",
    "although the analysis in this paper is primarily aimed at our specific ddm model , many of our findings have important implications for theories involving large extra dimensions in general .",
    "furthermore , our analysis can also serve as a prototype for phenomenological studies of theories in which there exist large numbers of interacting and decaying particles .",
    "it is important to emphasize why a general analysis of this sort is necessary , given the existence of numerous prior studies of the phenomenological and cosmological constraints on axions and axion - like fields , unstable relics , and the physical properties of miscellaneous dark - matter candidates .",
    "as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , such studies are typically applicable to dark sectors involving one or only a few fields , and are typically quoted in terms of limits on the mass , decay width , or couplings of any individual such field .",
    "it is not at all obvious how such bounds apply to a ddm _ ensemble _  a dark - matter candidate which is not characterized by a well - defined single mass , decay width , or set of couplings .",
    "for example , constraints on a cosmological population of unstable particles derived from big - bang - nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) considerations or bounds on distortions in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are generally derived under the assumption that such a population comprises but a single particle species with a well - defined lifetime and branching fractions .",
    "such constraints are not directly applicable to a ddm ensemble ( in which lifetimes are balanced against abundances ) , and must therefore be reexamined in this new context .    in this paper , we shall develop methods for dealing with these issues and for properly characterizing the constraints on models in which the dark - matter candidate is an ensemble of states rather than a single particle .",
    "as we shall find , the presence of non - trivial mixings among the kk excitations in our ddm model gives rise to a number of surprising effects which are ultimately critical for its phenomenological viability .",
    "one of these is a so - called `` decoherence '' phenomenon  @xcite which helps to explain how the dark matter in this model remains largely invisible to detection .",
    "another is a suppression , induced by this mixing , of the couplings between the lighter particles in the dark - matter ensemble and the fields of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "as we shall see , these effects assert themselves in a variety of phenomenological contexts and play a crucial role in loosening a battery of constraints which would otherwise prove extremely severe .",

    ", we shall therefore focus primarily on a `` photonic '' axion of this sort  , a general axion with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "we note that additional subtleties arise in this latter case , due to non - trivial mixings between the @xmath50 and other pseudoscalars present in the theory which also necessarily couple to @xmath76 . these include hadrons such as @xmath63 and @xmath77 , as well as any other axions in the theory which play a role in addressing the strong - cp problem  @xcite . in discussing constraints on hadronic axions",
    ", we shall implicitly assume that the full mass - squared matrix for the theory is such that the relationship between the @xmath50 and the mass eigenstates @xmath49 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defofalambda ] ) is not significantly disturbed .",
    "indeed , given the inherently large number of independent scales and couplings that emerge in scenarios involving multiple axions and other pseudoscalars , this is not an unreasonable assumption ; moreover , it is straightforward to show in a general way that these favorable conditions can always be arranged for certain sets of axion and pseudo - scalar mixings .",
    "such an assumption thereby enables us to perform our phenomenological analysis in a model - independent way .",
    "axions and axion - like fields can be produced via a number of different mechanisms in the early universe .",
    "for example , these particles can be produced thermally , via their interactions with the sm fields in the radiation bath .",
    "in addition , a number of non - thermal mechanisms exist through which a sizable population of axions also may be generated . these include production via vacuum misalignment , production from the decays of cosmic strings and other topological defects , and production from the out - of - equilibrium decays of other , heavier fields in the theory .",
    "this last mechanism is particularly relevant in the context of the ddm models , since , by assumption , the dark sector in such models involves large numbers of unstable fields with long lifetimes .",
    "indeed , in the axion ddm model under consideration in this paper , a non - thermal population of any @xmath49 may be produced via the decays of both heavier kk gravitons and other heavier @xmath49 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we focused on misalignment production as the primary mechanism responsible for establishing a cosmological population of dark axions . in order for the results for the relic abundances @xmath78 of the @xmath49 obtained there to be valid , the contributions from all of the alternative production mechanisms mentioned above must be subdominant for each @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , in this section , we examine each of the relevant axion - production mechanisms in turn , beginning with a brief review of the results for misalignment production itself .",
    "since phenomenological constraints on scenarios involving large , flat extra dimensions prefer that the reheating temperature @xmath79 associated with cosmic inflation be quite low  @xcite , we will hereafter operate within the context of a low - temperature - reheating ( ltr ) cosmology with @xmath80 .",
    "within such a cosmological context and within the region of model - parameter space in which misalignment production yields a total relic abundance @xmath81 comparable to the observed dark - matter relic abundance @xmath82 , we demonstrate that the contributions to each @xmath78 from all other production mechanisms are indeed subdominant .",
    "we begin our discussion of axion production in the early universe with a brief review of the misalignment mechanism and its implications for axion ddm models .",
    "( a more detailed discussion can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) as we shall see , this mechanism turns out to be the dominant production mechanism for dark - matter axions in such models .    at temperatures @xmath83 , the only contributions to the axion mass - squared matrix are the contributions from the kk masses . since these contributions to @xmath84 are diagonal in the kk eigenbasis , no mixing occurs , and the kk eigenstates are the mass eigenstates of the theory .",
    "the potential for each @xmath50 with @xmath85 is therefore non - vanishing , due to the presence of the kk masses , and is minimized at @xmath86 .",
    "however , the potential for the zero mode @xmath87 vanishes . in the absence of a potential for @xmath87 , there is no preferred vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath88 which minimizes @xmath89 .",
    "it therefore follows that immediately following the phase transition at @xmath90 , the universe comprises a set of domains , each with a different homogeneous background value for the axion field which may be expressed in terms of a `` misalignment angle '' @xmath91 .",
    "this angle is generically expected to be @xmath30 in any particular domain , but could also be smaller .",
    "we assume here that @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the value of the hubble parameter during inflation , and therefore that the value of @xmath94 is uniform over our present hubble volume . in this case",
    ", we find that @xmath95    note that the above discussion is strictly valid only in the limit in which the hubble volume is taken to infinity . in reality",
    ", the presence of a finite hubble volume limits our ability to distinguish fields with wavelengths larger than the hubble radius from true background values . because of this ambiguity , all @xmath50 for which @xmath96 can also acquire @xmath30 background values after @xmath4 breaking . in sect .",
    "[ sec : inflationscale ] , we will analyze the phenomenological consequences of this effect in detail and derive conditions under which it can be safely neglected .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , it turns out that within our preferred region of parameter space , these conditions involve only mild restrictions on the cosmological context into which our model is embedded .",
    "we will therefore assume from this point forward that the @xmath97 in our model are given by eq .",

    ".    at temperatures down to @xmath98 , the @xmath97 remain fixed at these initial values . at lower temperatures , however , the situation changes as instanton effects generate a potential for the axion kk modes .",
    "indeed , in the regime in which @xmath99 and the brane mass engendered by this potential has attained the constant , low - temperature value @xmath100 given in eq .",

    "depends more sensitively on the explicit time - dependence of the brane mass @xmath106 . in what follows ,",
    "we adopt a `` rapid - turn - on '' approximation , in which the instanton potential is assumed to turn on instantaneously at @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the time at which the confining transition for the gauge group @xmath0 occurs . in this approximation",

    "these relics include the higher kk modes of any fields which propagate within at least some subspace of the extra - dimensional bulk .",
    "for example , since the graviton field necessarily propagates throughout the entirety of the bulk , a population of unstable kk gravitons is a generic feature of all such scenarios . in the minimal bulk - axion ddm model under consideration here , the unstable relics whose decays can serve as a source for any given @xmath49 include these kk gravitons as well as other , heavier @xmath49 .",

[ fig : lhcaexclusion ] .",
    "since the green exclusion regions in this figure embody the most stringent such limits applicable to our ddm model , we shall take these to represent our collider constraints throughout the rest of this paper .",

    "the collider processes we have been discussing thus far are those whose event rates receive their contributions from the low - lying modes in the tower  , those @xmath49 with lifetimes @xmath437  s. by contrast , those heavy @xmath49 with lifetimes @xmath438  s tend to decay to pairs of sm fields _ within _ the detector volume .",
    "the decays of such states can in principle give rise to an entirely different set of signature patterns .",
    "for example , a promptly decaying @xmath49 which couples to light quarks or gluons as well as photons would in principle contribute to event rates in the @xmath439 and @xmath440 channels .",
    "however , since the total event rate in these channels receives contributions from a broad spectrum of @xmath49 with different @xmath134 , many event - selection techniques which are particularly useful in standard searches for new physics in these channels can not be applied to a tower of decaying bulk axions .",
    "for example , since the set of decaying axions can not characterized by a single , well - defined mass or cross - section , no identifiable peak can be expected to appear in the invariant - mass distribution for the decay products of the heavy axions .",
    "such considerations render the results of standard searches for new physics in these channels inapplicable to our bulk - axion model  and indeed to ddm models in general .",
    "moreover , they also likely render the identification of a conclusive signal of non - standard dark - matter physics in these channels particularly challenging .",
    "nevertheless , the information that could potentially be revealed about the nature of the dark sector via such an identification is of sufficient magnitude and importance that an analysis of the discovery potential in these channels is an interesting topic for future study .      up to this point , we have considered those phenomenological constraints on our ddm model which are related to the production of particles which compose our bulk - axion ensemble , both with and without their subsequent detection . by contrast , we now turn to discuss an entirely different set of phenomenological constraints , namely those which arise due to the potential decays of a _ pre - existing _ cosmological population of such particles . indeed ,",
    "such constraints emerge generically in all dark - matter scenarios in which the dark sector contains unstable , long - lived particles , and can be derived from observational limits on the physical consequences of the late decays of those particles .",
    "there are many considerations which can be used to place such limits on scenarios involving decaying dark - matter particles .",
    "for example , photons produced via the decays of such particles can yield observable distortions in the cmb spectrum ; contribute to the diffuse extragalactic x - ray and gamma - ray backgrounds ; upset bbn predictions for the primordial abundances of light elements ; and result in unacceptably large entropy production during critical epochs in the history of the universe .",
    "constraints on dark - matter candidates from considerations of this sort depend not only on the decay rate of the particle species in question , but also on the relic abundance of that species . for this reason ,",
    "the constraints applicable to single - particle models of dark - matter are generally not directly applicable to models within the ddm framework .",
    "it is therefore necessary to revisit the observational limits on dark - matter decays within the context of our bulk - axion model of dynamical dark matter and assess how these limits constrain the parameter space of this model .    in this section ,",
    "we begin our analysis of the constraints on the late decays of the @xmath49 in our bulk - axion ddm model by examining observational limits on the distortions of the cmb which such decays can induce . the type of cmb distortion to which a late - decaying particle contributes depends on the time at which that particle decays . in the very early universe ,",
    "photons produced by particle decays are brought into thermal and kinetic equilibrium with cmb photons via a number of processes .",
    "the dominant processes by which newly - produced photons can equilibrate _ thermally _ with cmb photons are double - compton scattering ( @xmath441 ) and bremsstrahlung ( @xmath442 , where @xmath443 is an ion ) .",

    "even after double - compton scattering and bremsstrahlung effectively shut off , a number of photon - number - conserving interactions still serve to bring photons produced at even later times into _ kinetic _ equilibrium with the radiation bath .",
    "dominant among these processes is elastic compton scattering ( @xmath451 ) , which efficiently serves to bring photons produced by @xmath49 decays into kinetic equilibrium until a much later time @xmath452",

    "the helioscope - constraint contour , for example , is related to processes in which axions are both produced and subsequently detected via their interactions with sm fields .",
    "likewise , the contour associated with limits on features in the diffuse x - ray and gamma - ray backgrounds is due to processes involving the decays of a preexisting cosmological population of axions , and therefore depends not only on the couplings of the @xmath49 to sm fields , but to their relative abundances as well .",

    "@xcite , we proposed a new framework for dark - matter physics which we call `` dynamical dark matter '' ( ddm ) .",

    "some of these constraints pertain to theories with large extra dimensions in general , while others pertain specifically to our model . among the bounds we have considered",
    "are constraints from limits on @xmath49 production by astrophysical sources such as stars and supernovae ; constraints related to the effects of late relic - axion decays on bbn , the cmb , and the diffuse x - ray and gamma - ray backgrounds ; collider constraints on missing - energy processes such as @xmath423 and @xmath424 ; constraints on isocurvature perturbations generated as a consequence of misalignment production ; constraints on the production of relativistic axions due to interactions in the thermal bath after inflation ; and constraints on the direct detection of dark axions by microwave - cavity detectors and other , similar instruments .",
    "we have verified that all of these constraints are satisfied within the preferred region of parameter space for our model  namely , that in which the bulk - axion ddm ensemble accounts for the observed dark - matter relic abundance , while at the same time the full tower of axion modes contributes meaningfully to that abundance .",
    "we therefore conclude that this bulk - axion ddm model is indeed phenomenologically viable , and that the overall ddm framework is a self - consistent alternative to traditional approaches to the dark - matter problem .    while the focus of this paper has been on the specific bulk - axion ddm model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we note that many of our results , and in many places our entire methodology , have a far wider range of applicability .",

    "<S> in two recent papers  @xcite we introduced `` dynamical dark matter '' ( ddm ) , a new framework for dark - matter physics in which the requirement of stability is replaced by a delicate balancing between lifetimes and cosmological abundances across a vast ensemble of individual dark - matter components whose collective behavior transcends that normally associated with traditional dark - matter candidates . </S>",
    "<S> we also presented an explicit model involving axions in large extra spacetime dimensions , and demonstrated that this model has all of the features necessary to constitute a viable realization of the general ddm framework . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we complete our study by performing a general analysis of all phenomenological constraints which are relevant to this bulk - axion ddm model . </S>",
    "<S> although the analysis in this paper is primarily aimed at our specific ddm model , many of our findings have important implications for bulk axion theories in general . </S>",
