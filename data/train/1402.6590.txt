    "7 are strongly suggesting large deformations for the cluster structures .",
    "we may conclude that the reduction of the moments of inertia of the lowest bands of @xmath55o is consistent with the assumption that the strongly bound @xmath7c nucleus having equivalent properties to @xmath19o , has a similar role as @xmath19o in relevant , less neutron rich nuclei .",
    "therefore , the ikeda - diagram @xcite and the `` extended ikeda - diagram '' consisting of @xmath19o cluster cores with covalently bound neutrons @xcite must be further extended to include also the @xmath7c cluster cores as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the link of @xmath0-clustering , quasimolecular resonances , orbiting phenomena and extreme deformations ( sd , hd , ... ) has been discussed in this work . in particular , by using @xmath21-ray spectroscopy of coincident binary fragments from either inelastic excitations and direct transfers in the @xmath18mg+@xmath1c reaction . from a careful analysis of the @xmath19o+@xmath20ne @xmath0-transfer exit - channel",

    "new results regarding cluster and molecular states in neutron - rich oxygen isotopes in agreement with amd predictions are presented .",
    "consequently , the  extended ikeda - diagram `` has been further modified for light neutron - rich nuclei by inclusion of the @xmath7c cluster , similarly to the @xmath19o one . of particular interest is the quest for the 4@xmath0 states of @xmath19o near the @xmath44be+@xmath44be and @xmath1c+@xmath0 decay thresholds , which correspond to the so - called  hoyle '' state . the search for extremely elongated configurations ( hd ) in rapidly rotating medium - mass nuclei , which has been pursued by @xmath21-ray spectroscopy measurements , will have to be performed in conjunction with charged - particle techniques in the near future since such states are most certainly going to decay by particle emission ( see @xcite ) .",
