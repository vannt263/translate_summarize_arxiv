    "group field theories ( gfts ) @xcite are quantum field theories on group manifolds , with the group chosen to be the local gauge group of spacetime in d dimensions , i.e. the lorentz group , or a suitable extension of it , for models aiming at a quantization of d - dimensional gravity .",
    "they are characterized by a non - local pairing of field arguments in the interaction term , designed in such a way as to produce , in perturbative expansion , feynman diagrams with a combinatorial structure that are in 1 - 1 correspondence with d - dimensional simplicial complexes .",
    "because of these basic properties , gfts can be understood as a generalization of matrix models @xcite for 2-dimensional quantum gravity , obtained in two steps : 1 ) by passing to generic tensors , instead of matrices , as fundamental variables , thus obtaining a generating functional for the sum over 3d simplicial complexes that was the essence of the dynamical triangulations approach to 3d quantum gravity@xcite ; 2 ) adding group structure defining extra geometric degrees of freedom .",
    "the last step is what turns a generic tensor model into a proper field theory .",
    "in fact , the first example of a gft was the group - theoretic generalization of 3d tensor models proposed by boulatov @xcite .",
    "it was already at this initial stage , that group field theories allowed a direct contact between simplicial quantum gravity and what we now call spin foam models @xcite .",
    "in fact the boulatov model , sharing the same combinatorics of tensor models and thus reproducing a 3d sum over triangulations , in perturbative expansion , produces weights for these triangulations given by the so - called ponzano - regge spin foam model , thanks to the additional su(2 ) group structure .",
    "we now know that this is just one example of a very general result @xcite : any group field theory produces feynman amplitudes that can be re - expressed as spin foam models , and , conversely , any spin foam model for fixed 2-complex can be understood as the feynman amplitude for a given feynman diagram of a corresponding gft . in turn",
    ", spin foam models @xcite have been a very active ( and growing ) area of quantum gravity research in the past ten years , for two main ( and related ) reasons .",
    "first , one obtains a spin foam model when considering , once more , a discretization of continuum 1st order gravity , formulated as a constrained bf theory , on a simplicial complex , and quantizes it via path integral methods .",
    "second , spin foams as 2-complexes with faces labelled by group representations arise naturally when considering the dynamics of the kinematical quantum states of geometry as identified by canonical loop quantum gravity @xcite ; indeed , from the lqg perspective , spin foams represents the histories of spin networks and are thus the crucial ingredient of any path integral or covariant formulation of the quantum gravity dynamics in lqg . from both the simplicial and canonical perspective ,",
    "a sum over spin foams , weighted by appropriate amplitudes , is necessary to define in full the dynamics of the gravitational field : in simplicial quantum gravity because only such sum ( lacking a suitably defined refinement procedure ) can compensate the truncation of geometric degrees of freedom that the restriction to a given lattice imposes ; in lqg , because a complete path integral formulation of the dynamics needs , in general , i.e. except in the purely topological case or for very special choices of observables , a sum over all the histories between given spin network states . at present , group field theories are the only known tool to define uniquely such sum over spin foams , i.e. with fully specified weights , in a perturbative expansion of the gft partition function . in this property , lies the main reason of interest in gfts , from the lqg perspective . and indeed , up to now , group field theories have been mainly considered and used just as such : as a _",
    "tool _ to define a sum over spin foams with prescribed weights , i.e. as an auxiliary formalism to define / construct spin foam models .",
    "a different perspective is however possible , even if only tentatively or as a working hypothesis , at present , given the very limited understanding and control we have of the whole group field theory formalism .",
    "this perspective has been advocated and described in more detail in @xcite , to which we refer .",
    "+ group field theories can be understood as a 2nd quantized formulation of both loop quantum gravity and simplicial gravity , in which wave functions over the space of geometries are turned into classical fields first and then into operators .",
    "in fact , the quanta of the gft field correspond to d - valent spin network vertices @xcite and , at the same time , to ( d-1)-simplices . since both loop quantum gravity and simplicial quantum gravity ( in its quantum regge calculus as well as in its dynamical triangulations formulation ) are meant to be themselves a quantization of what is already a classical field theory , i.e. general relativity , a 2nd quantization of the same provides a formalism very similar in spirit to what was ( somewhat improperly ) dubbed third quantizationof gravity @xcite .",
    "this was a formal quantum field theory on superspace ( the space of all 3-geometries on , say , @xmath0 ) which would have canonical quantum gr corresponding to its quantum 1-particle sector , and would produce a sum over topologies in perturbative feynman expansion , obtained as interaction processes of quantum universes ( the particlesof this formalism ) .",
    "clearly , the mathematical difficulties as well as those regarding the physical interpretation of the whole formalism are formidable , and consequently they prevented any substantial development . +",
    "the group field theory formalism @xcite greatly improves the situation , both at the mathematical and physical level , by turning to a discrete and local picture of superspace , in which what is propagated , created and annihilated are local chunks of a ( d-1)-dimensional quantum space ( again , spin network vertices or ( d-1)-simplices ) .",
    "one feature of 3rd quantization is retained , and even generalized , however : on the one hand these fundamental building blocks of quantum space can be combined at the kinematical level to represent , in principle , any spatial geometry and topology , and on the other hand their interactions still produce , in perturbative feynman expansion , quantum spacetimes of any topology . +",
    "this step from a continuum to a discrete setting has another important consequence .",
    "if the quantum gravity feynman diagrams in the 3rd quantized formalism were smooth manifolds , and the continuum path integral for quantum gravity on the given manifold represented , by construction , the feynman amplitude for each of them , in the discrete version of 3rd quantization provided by group field theories the feynman diagrams are given by combinatorial and un - embedded 2-complexes or , dually , by simplicial complexes , and the feynman amplitudes have the interpretation of discrete path integrals ( sum over discrete geometries ) over each simplicial complex .",
    "+ this feature allows not only a better mathematical control on the quantities involved , but it also makes group field theories , at least in principle , a common framework for several approaches to quantum gravity , providing the basis for potential cross - fertilization and mutual enrichment . + as mentioned , each group field theory , in fact completely defines a possible dynamics for loop quantum gravity spin network states , thus proposing an explicit solution ( even if yet to be put to test ) for one outstanding challenge of the lqg programme . at the same time",
    ", it does so by defining a sum over histories that includes the crucial ingredients of both main simplicial quantum gravity approaches . as in quantum regge calculus @xcite",
    ", it defines the dynamics of a quantum and classical simplicial geometry in terms of a sum over discrete geometric data ( edge lengths , areas , etc , according to dimension ) for a given base simplicial complex .",
    "in addition to this , it provides a possible way to encode all the continuum geometric degrees of freedom by a covariant procedure that is alternative to the infinite refinement procedure for fixed incidence matrix , that has proven to be problematic at the quantum level , in quantum regge calculus : a sum over inequivalent triangulations . in this",
    "it obviously agrees with the dynamical triangulations ( dt ) approach @xcite ; in fact , freezing the discrete geometric data attached to each complex ( this can be done in various ways ) turns the perturbative expansion of gfts into a form very similar to the sum over triangulations weighted by a purely combinatorial factor that characterizes the dt approach ; such formulation , in its _ causal _ restriction ( corresponding to summing over a certain restricted class of lorentzian triangulations ) @xcite , has recently proven to be much more successful in recovering a continuum spacetime from the quantum theory . as a bonus , with respect to the dynamical triangulations approach ,",
    "the gft approach permits a better control over the classical and quantum _ simplicial _ dynamics of geometry , which is here akin to the few - particlephysics in the usual qfts .",
    "this stems from the possibility of a finer control over simplicial geometric variables , that puts gfts and their spin foam amplitudes in closer relation with lqg , regge calculus and other formulations of classical simplicial gravity .",
    "this seems also to be confirmed by recent results on the spin foam / lqg lattice graviton , which match at least partially the results of simplicial gravity , in the regime where a connection between the two approaches can be made precise @xcite .",
    "the links between group field theories and other approaches to quantum gravity are detailed in @xcite , to which we refer .",
    "+ it should be clear , however , that much more remains to be understood about these links and that only further work can confirm or refute the idea that group field theories really represent in concrete terms a unifying framework for all of them , as we have been suggesting . as for the relationship with lqg , the open issues concern both the exact correspondence between gft boundary states and their hilbert space , in specific models , and that of usual su(2 ) lqg spin networks , as well as the relation between the gft transition amplitudes and the canonical lqg hamiltonian constraint , defining the quantum dynamics .",
    "these issues will not concern us here .",
    "the focus of our present work is instead on the relation between gfts and simplicial quantum gravity , and the aim is to make the correspondence between the two framework detailed and clear , with a precise matching between gft feynman amplitudes and simplicial quantum gravity sum over histories . in order to achieve this ,",
    "we introduce and analyze in the present paper a new class of group field theories , characterized by feynman amplitudes which have , in any dimension and in any signature , _ exactly _ the form of a simplicial gravity path integral .",
    "its amplitudes , that is , are expressed as a ( real ) measure part times a phase factor , with phase clearly identified with a simplicial gravity action . in 3 dimensions , this will mean obtaining a path integral for 3-dimensional simplicial gravity in first order formalism , corresponding to a 1st order regge calculus action plus higher order ( @xmath1-like ) corrections . in higher dimensions , we will obtain instead a path integral , augmented by a sum over triangulations of any topology , for what can be interpreted as topological bf theory with an additional orientation dependence , and , again , higher order ( quantum ) corrections to the action .",
    "this work can be understood as the further development of the line of research on the issue of causality in spin foam quantum gravity and gft , and on the construction of a unified gft framework for loop quantum gravity , spin foam models , quantum regge calculus and dynamical triangulations , that started from an analysis of the issue of causality in spin foam models @xcite , continued with the development of a refined technique for the construction of causal spin foam models , based on the particle analogy which implicitly introduced additional variables into the usual spin foam formalism , in @xcite , with the explicit construction of causal spin foam models for pure gravity and gravity coupled to matter in 3d @xcite , and with the construction of a generalized gft formalism @xcite based on the techniques and variables introduced in @xcite .",
    "the present gft construction is indeed , in a sense , a much improved and further developed version of the one in @xcite , in a sense to be detailed in the following . + we will detail both the motivation , the basic ideas and the results of our work in the next section . in section",
    "iii we present the general definition of the new class of gfts , and the general structure of its feynman amplitudes .",
    "section iv and v report instead the detailed form of the amplitudes of these models in 3 and 4 dimensions , in both riemannian and lorentzian cases , and a discussion of their properties .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results and an outlook on their relevance for further developments in this area .",
    "we assume now that the above perspective on group field theory as a discrete quantum field theory ( 3rd quantized ) of spin networks or of simplicial geometry , and as a potential common unifying framework for different approaches to quantum gravity , is agreed upon , if tentatively only .",
    "let us now focus on the following questions : what types of amplitudes we then expect or want the gft feynman diagrams to be assigned ?",
    "that is , what properties and main features our spin foam amplitudes should have ?",
    "how should they look like , if they are indeed feynman amplitudes for a field theory on a simplicial superspace ?      from a path integral for a field theory on superspace , continuum or discrete , we expect to obtain a definition of causal transition amplitudes between quantum gravity states , i.e. the quantum gravity analogue of what , in ordinary field theory , is represented by expectation values in the vacuum state of time - ordered products of field operators . however , no time coordinate is allowed , in a fully background independent and diffeomorphism invariant theory of quantum gravity , to enter the definition of transition amplitudes , as it does through the minkowskian time when we define time - ordered 2-point functions in the usual qft . therefore , in quantum gravity , the difference between the various possible 2-point functionscan be characterized purely in terms of symmetry properties and of other formal features of them , independent of any spacetime coordinates .",
    "let us look at some of these features .",
    "for further discussion on this , see @xcite , and for a classic treatment of the issue of causality and different transition amplitudes in quantum gravity , within the covariant path integral approach , see @xcite",
    ".    consider the simplest case of a 4d spacetime of topology @xmath2 , with compact @xmath3 .",
    "this spacetime has two boundaries , call them @xmath4 and @xmath5 , to which we associate a 3d spatial geometry @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "assume now that we can uniquely associate ( within a canonical quantum theory ) a state @xmath8 to the geometry @xmath6 , and @xmath9 to the geometry @xmath7 .",
    "the basic idea underlying the time - lesscharacterization of the causal quantum gravity transition amplitudes @xmath10 is that , even if these can not correspond to any time - ordering , they do implement a time - less orderingor , better , a _ causal ordering_. this consists in the requirement that @xmath7 lies in the causal future of @xmath6 , which in turn can be formulated , when a canonical decomposition of the gravity variables is possible , as the requirement that the lapse function ( which in a suitable gauge is equivalent to a proper time ) between the two boundaries can only take positive values @xcite .",
    "note that the formulation of this criterion does not require any use of coordinates .",
    "notice also that the above has a direct analogue in the definition of different green functions for a relativistic particle @xcite , where it defines indeed the feynman propagator .",
    "moreover , this criterion can be generalized to the situation in which no canonical decomposition is available , for example , keeping the same boundaries and boundary states , for spacetimes of non - trivial topology . in such cases",
    "it can be formulated as the requirement that the amplitude is _ orientation dependent _ , i.e. that it turns into its complex conjugate if the spacetime orientation is reversed .",
    "if the dynamics is defined by a quantum gravity path integral , in metric variables , all these requirements are automatically encoded in the definition of the configuration space as the space of all metrics up to diffeomorphisms and of the quantum amplitude as the exponential of @xmath11 times the einstein - hilbert action ( or some higher - derivatives extension ) , times a diffeo - invariant real measure : h_2h_1=_g h_1,h_2ge^is_eh(g ) .",
    "[ pathintegral]indeed , this corresponds , in a canonical formulation to : h_2h_1= nn^i , [ pathintegralcan]with the integration range @xmath12 over the lapse function @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the above amplitude is _ complex _ , _ causal _",
    "( @xmath7 is in the causal future of @xmath6 ) and _ orientation dependent _ ( it turns into its own complex conjugate under switch of spacetime orientation , as @xmath14 under this transformation , equivalent to switching positive to negative lapse ) .",
    "moreover , it defines , at least formally , a _ green function _ of the hamiltonian constraint operator , the dynamical equation of motion of pure gravity , for trivial spacetime topology , not a solution of it , i.e. it satisfies : @xmath15 .",
    "notice that the same definition for the quantum gravity path integral results in an orientation dependent transition amplitude also in the case of riemannian quantum gravity , i.e. the quantization of riemannian geometry , even though then the causality interpretation is not applicable to the same restriction on the lapse function . + a quick comparison with the usual ( say , free ) quantum field theory case , or , for that matter , with the relativistic particle case",
    ", shows that these same properties are shared by the time - ordered product of field operators and by the usual feynman propagator . actually , in these simplified contexts , the above properties _ select uniquely _ the feynman propagator or time - ordered n - point function among the various qft n - point functions or particle propagators .    in the formal 3rd quantized framework , as in usual qft , the path integral of the field theory itself provides , after field insertions , a definition of the causal transition amplitudes .",
    "how this is realized in the 3rd quantized formalism is only apparent in perturbative expansion , and , once more , at a rather formal level , given the poor understanding of the formalism itself .",
    "however , also in the gft case , we are at present lacking control of the theory beyond the perturbative regime .",
    "therefore it is instructive to recall how the causal transition amplitudes are characterized in usual qft perturbative expansion . consider",
    "then some time ordered product of field operators in the vacuum state ; one inserts the appropriate combination of fields in the path integral expression for the partition function of the field theory , and expands in powers of the coupling constant , obtaining the usual sum over feynman diagrams weighted by amplitudes obtained by gluing propagators with interaction vertices .",
    "the choice of field insertion characterizes the boundary states and the original time ordering is reflected in the presence of the feynman propagator in each individual particle line of a feynman diagram .",
    "this propagator , in position variables , can be expressed as a sum over histories for the single particle it refers to , i.e. by a path integral weighted by the usual relativistic particle action @xcite .",
    "if one does the same for all the particles involved in a given feynman diagram , the whole feynman amplitude can be put in the form of a path integral for a discrete system of particles , weighted by the exponential of the classical action , and with a constraint on their histories in position space , representing the particle interactions .",
    "the causality restriction enters , as we said , in the use of the feynman propagator , which results from restricting the proper time ( or lapse in canonical variables ) along each particle history to be positive , in turn giving a complex amplitude given by the exponential of @xmath11 times the particle action @xcite .",
    "the restriction to positive proper times or lapses is also equivalent to a dependence of the amplitude on the orientation of the particle trajectories .",
    "+ the same happens in the formal 3rd quantization setting for gravity @xcite : each feynman diagram , a discrete history of universe interactions , is weighted by an amplitude given by the path integral ( [ pathintegral ] ) , the exponential of the gravity action , i.e. the geometric action for the particle - universe for each line of propagation , plus appropriate joining conditions representing the interactions .",
    "as we have discussed above , such path integral for gravity is a green function of the dynamical constraint equations ( as the feynman propagator for the klein - gordon equation ) , and it is causal and orientation dependent in the sense specified @xcite .",
    "note also that the end result of combining the path integrals for gravity on trivial topology with the joining conditions for interactions is again a path integral for gravity with the same type of amplitude on a spacetime with non - trivial topology .",
    "the analogy with particle dynamics and usual qfts is even clearer if one recalls @xcite that the einstein s equations define indeed the dynamics of a free particle moving in superspace .    in a gft , in light of its proposed physical interpretation , we would expect a similar structure for the feynman amplitudes .",
    "the discrete histories of possible interactions for the gft quanta are , as discussed , combinatorial 2-complexes dual to simplicial complexes , because the quanta themselves are identified with spin network vertices or ( d-1)-simplices , as said .",
    "therefore , if the gft degrees of freedom and dynamics are to represent a quantum geometry and its evolution , we would expect the amplitudes associated to its discrete ( virtual ) histories , the gft feynman amplitudes , to have the form of a path integral for discrete gravity , i.e. an exponential of some classical discrete gravity action .",
    "this way , they would have the sought for properties of causality / orientation dependence and complexity on top of making the relation with classical and quantum discrete gravity manifest . once more",
    ", it is the _ complex nature _ of the feynman amplitudes and their having the form of an _ exponential of some simplicial gravity action _ , that would permit the interpretation of gfts as 3rd quantized theories of simplicial geometry and as providing a definition of discrete quantum gravity transition amplitudes . +",
    "this expected and , we argue , _ needed _ general feature of gft models does not , by itself , select the _ specific form of the simplicial action _ that has to appear in the gft feynman amplitudes . on the contrary , because gfts are supposed to describe quantum gravity _ at all scales _",
    "( unless the future development of the formalism will turn out to show some unavoidable breakdown or incompleteness of the same , beyond some energy or distance scale ) , one should , a priori , expect a very general formulation of classical simplicial gravity to describe the classical dynamics of the gft quanta .",
    "this may correspond , for example , to some generalized action for regge calculus , with higher - order terms , e.g. higher powers of the curvature , appearing as the phase of our complex gft feynman amplitudes .",
    "indeed , we will see how our new proposed gfts produce very general types of simplicial actions inside their _ complex _ feynman amplitudes , the regge action being just one contribution , although the dominant one in physically interesting limits .",
    "this is _ not _ what happens in current gft models .",
    "the feynman amplitudes / spin foam models of _ all _ current gfts are instead : real , a - causal and orientation independent , so that they do not reflect the orientation of the underlying simplicial complex nor allow for the identification of any ordering between the boundary states . in this sense",
    "they define a - causal transition amplitudes .",
    "this structure is due to an underlying @xmath16 symmetry of the spin foam amplitudes , first identified and interpreted in @xcite , which erases the orientation dependence of the same amplitudes at the level of each dual 2-cell or ( d-2)-simplex . still in @xcite , and in @xcite , it was shown how breaking this symmetry and restoring the orientation dependence would lead to feynman amplitudes with a much more direct relation with 1st order discrete gravity and with the expected exponential form .",
    "+ usual spin foam models correspond , then , to a sort of symmetrized discrete path integralsfor gravity in 1st order form .",
    "the continuum ( and 2nd order ) counterpart of such symmetrized discrete gravity path integral is given , formally , by the same formula ( [ pathintegralcan ] ) , but with the range of integration over the lapse function extended to the full real interval @xmath17 .",
    "this formula gives a covariant definition of the physical inner product between canonical quantum gravity states and thus of the projector operator onto solutions of the hamiltonian constraint operator .",
    "in fact the resulting quantity , morally a definition of @xmath18is a _ solution _ of the hamiltonian constraint equation in both its arguments @xcite , and it is a real quantity , as expected from a canonical inner product , as well as a - causal in that nothing constraints one boundary geometry to lie in the causal future of the other .",
    "this is not so surprising , and maybe not even un - welcome , given that spin foam models have been introduced exactly in order to define in a covariant way the canonical physical inner product @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath19 _ does not _ correspond to the lagrangian path integral ( [ pathintegral ] ) , and thus it is _ not _ what we would expect to obtain , in perturbative expansion , in a properly defined field theory on superspace .",
    "the difference lies in the requirement of an additional symmetry on top of the lagrangian 4-diffeos @xcite : positive and negative lapses correspond in fact to the _ same _ class of 4-geometries , and the difference between the two half - ranges @xmath12 and @xmath20 is only that they correspond to _ opposite spacetime orientations_. in other words , the above quantity in lagrangian formulation is given by a different _ symmetric _ choice of quantum amplitude , but for the same space of 4d geometries : h^2 h^1 _ h = g ( e^is(g ) + e^-is(g ) ) .",
    "[ pathintegralsym ] another insightful way of looking at the difference between the two ranges of lapse integration , or between ( [ pathintegral ] ) and ( [ pathintegralsym ] ) , is by recalling the difference between lagrangian and hamiltonian symmetries , the first being the 4d spacetime diffeomorphisms and the second being the transformations generated by the canonical operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite . the second set of symmetries is actually _ larger _ than the first , and the two coincide only after imposition of ( some ) equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the range @xmath23 is symmetric under transformations of the lapse corresponding to 4d spacetime diffeos , while it is not under canonical symmetries that can connect positive and negative lapses , thus requiring a symmetric range @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lagrangian path integral needs a further symmetrization ( [ pathintegralsym ] ) to satisfy the wheeler - dewitt equation . in a formulation of quantum gravity as a quantum field theory on superspace ,",
    "then , one would expect the symmetrized amplitudes ( [ pathintegralsym ] ) to arise as feynman amplitudes only from a _ restriction _ or in a special _ subsector _ of a more general field theory producing instead ( [ pathintegral ] ) as the typical feynman amplitude .",
    "+ once more , all this has a very precise analogue in the sum - over - histories formulation of the dynamics of a relativistic particle , with the symmetrized path integral corresponding to the hadamard propagator , given in momentum space by @xmath25 , thus imposing the hamiltonian constraint equation @xmath26 , instead of the feynman propagator , given in momentum space by @xmath27 , thus relaxing the same hamiltonian constraint at the quantum level .",
    "some confusion may arise from the fact that usual spin foam model _ do _ indeed come from a path integral quantization of a discrete action , at least in 3d .",
    "this is , however , bf theory which , although closely related to gravity , does not coincide with it .",
    "the difference between 3d bf theory and 3d gravity in 1st order form is that the triad field in a gravity path integral is summed over those configurations corresponding to positive volume element only , while the b field in 3d bf theory is summed over both positive and negative volumes ; this has been emphasized in @xcite .",
    "this again is the first order counterpart of the symmetrization ( [ pathintegralsym ] ) , and corresponds to a larger set of symmetries at the quantum level in bf theory with respect to 1st order gravity .",
    "a similar mismatch between constrained bf - like theories and 1st order gravity arises in higher dimensions as well @xcite .",
    "such mismatch also explains @xcite why , in the semiclassical , large representation limit , and thus after suppression of quantum interference between configurations associated to opposite orientations at the level of each dual face , the spin foam vertex amplitude of all known models still gives the cosine of the discrete gravity action for a single simplex , as opposed to the exponential of it @xcite .",
    "moreover , we note here that the large-@xmath28 semiclassical limit can be understood as suppressing , together with interference between quantum configurations , also all quantum corrections to the regge action somehow hidden in usual spin foam models , leaving only the dominant regge term , even though still within a sum over opposite orientations producing the mentioned cosine factor .",
    "this second suppression mechanism , in a slightly different form , will be shown at work also in our new gft models , where it will indeed reduce the gft feynman amplitudes to the form of a simple exponential of the regge action for simplicial gravity , with its quantum ( higher order ) corrections being negligible in the limit .",
    "this being the situation , we would then like to identify the true gft analogue of the quantum gravity causal transition amplitudes , or , more precisely , we would like to construct group field theories for which , as in ordinary qft , the feynman expansion of n - point functions produces feynman amplitudes given by the exponential of a discrete gravity action ,",
    "i.e. with the causality restrictions implicitly , automatically , but also clearly implemented .",
    "this , for us , would be a clear sign that we are capturing the causal dynamics of discrete gravity correctly .",
    "+ a subsequent analysis of how the usual spin foam models arise from a suitable restriction of these generalized amplitudes , or as a special limit of this new class of gfts would then shed some additional light on the exact relation between bf theories and gravity as well as on the role of the canonical physical inner product between quantum gravity states within a covariant field theory on superspace , in the more rigorous setting of both loop quantum gravity and group field theories .",
    "an additional motivation for constructing this new class of gfts is that they would bring simplicial quantum gravity approaches in much closer contact with the spin foam formalism for discrete gravity path integrals , and , via spin foams , with loop quantum gravity . actually , there is hope that this new class of gfts may represent _ the _ common unified framework in which both simplicial quantum gravity approaches , quantum regge calculus and dynamical triangulations , as well as loop quantum gravity / spin foam one can be subsumed , for mutual benefit and further development of each .",
    "the general idea of gfts as a common framework has been explained in the introduction , and it remains an interesting and intriguing perspective , in our opinion , regardless of our present results .",
    "however , one crucial step is needed in order to make such perspective a concrete reality , and provide a solid basis for understanding the _ exact _ links between gfts , loop quantum gravity and simplicial quantum gravity .",
    "this step has the same goal as the motivations we already gave above arising from a purely 3rd quantization perspective : this goal is to construct gft models with feynman amplitudes given _",
    "exactly _ by the exponential of a simplicial gravity action , times some appropriate measure .",
    "this is the step we take with the present work .",
    "in fact , both quantum regge calculus and dynamical triangulations , although differing in the choice of variables used to encode the geometry of gravity at a simplicial level ( geometric data / edge lengths in the first case , combinatorics of simplicial complexes in the second ) , identify the quantum amplitude to be associated to each spacetime geometry with the exponential of the regge action for simplicial gravity , indeed a beautiful coordinate - free description of classical simplicial geometry @xcite .",
    "a gft _ with the same type of quantum amplitudes _ for its feynman diagrams and with a sum over both geometric data and triangulations would represent a unification and a generalization of both approaches in a very literal , transparent sense .",
    "+ an interesting difference , as for the classical simplicial action used , between usual simplicial quantum gravity and gfts , can be already envisaged .",
    "gfts are based on a 1st order formulation of gravity and a group theoretic description of geometry . in other words",
    "they refer to a palatini - like or bf - like formulation of gravity in terms of a d - bein field and a connection field .",
    "we would then expect that the sought for generalized gfts would produce amplitudes given by exponentials of a simplicial gravity action in 1st order variables as well , i.e. with a double set of geometric variables : one corresponding to d - beins , and thus assigning volume information to the simplicial complex , and the other corresponding to a connection , and thus defining a group - theoretic notion of curvature , in terms of holonomies . in pure bf theory ,",
    "in fact , the b field is just a lagrange multiplier and one can achieve a formulation of the quantum amplitudes using only the connection variables , and basically imposing the flatness condition everywhere . in gravity , however , one relaxes this condition and the d - bein is a true dynamical field , that we would expect to find as a dynamical variable in the path integral as well as a configuration / momentum variable in the definition of a field theory on superspace , alongside the connection field .",

    "+ with the aim of reproducing the above type of classical action , plus the hope that this will lead to a more straightforward way of imposing the above constraint than in the usual spin foam procedure , and the main motivation of imposing the causality / orientation dependence condition , which is in fact a restriction on the integration range over the b field , we are thus led to introduce additional variables , directly identifiable with the b field of bf theory , into the usual gft formalism , which is based on the connection variables only ( group elements ) .",
    "we will indeed obtain , from our new gfts , a 3rd quantized version of discrete bf theory in any dimension and any signature , _ with an additional restriction on orientation _ automatically imposed , as well as incorporating what can be interpreted as quantum corrections to the above classical action ( akin to higher derivative corrections to the einstein - hilbert action in effective approaches to continuum gravity ) .",
    "this means that we will obtain a 3rd quantization of discrete 1st order gravity in 3d , and of an orientation - restricted bf theory in higher dimension . in 4d the corresponding gft model",
    "would represent , we believe , the most suitable framework in which to implement the classical constraints on the b field that reduce bf theory to gravity , that have been extensively studied in the construction of spin foam models for 4d gravity ( see e.g. the recent @xcite ) , because it may make the identification and implementation of the geometric constraints at the simplicial level more straightforward , and in a context in which the needed orientation dependence / causality restriction is already implemented .      before proceeding to the discussion of our results and of the new gft formalism ,",
    "let us conclude by anticipating motivation , interpretation and advantages of the specific way we have chosen of introducing the additional variables corresponding to the continuum b field .",
    "+ in the usual spin foam models , such as the ponzano - regge model for bf theory , as well as in the gft models that generate them , such as the boulatov model , the variable that is interpreted as the discrete counterpart of the b field of the original continuum bf theory is the representation label j associated to each ( d-2)-face of the simplicial complex .",
    "this is first of all justified by the way it enters the expression for the spin foam amplitudes , after peter - weyl decomposition of the same . in the riemannian 3d case , for example , one indeed gets , for each dual face @xcite :    d^3 b_f = ( g_f ) = _",

    "one gets the last expression in ( [ facebf ] ) , which indeed resembles the starting expression but with a discrete replacement for the @xmath30 variables : the representation labels @xmath41 . the same happens in the usual gfts .",
    "apart from the formal similarities , one physical rationale for the identification of the @xmath41 with a discretized b field is the fact that it is conjugate to the connection variables , i.e. to the group elements @xmath42 , in the sense of fourier transforms , just as the b field is canonically conjugate to the a field in the hamiltonian formulation of classical bf theory .",
    "this reasoning is of course sensible , and it is indeed supported by the respective role group representations and group elements play in loop quantum gravity , again following canonical analysis in the continuum , but it is also not fully conclusive .",
    "there are a few reasons for being dissatisfied with this interpretation , even if they are , admittedly , not at all conclusive either .",
    "one is that the @xmath41 corresponds more precisely to just _ one _ component of the original b field , its ( discretized ) absolute value , with the other components still missing any identification within the formalism .",
    "the situation , in this respect , has been ameliorated somewhat by the recent development of new spin foam models for bf theory and gravity @xcite based on coherent states . here , the additional parameters labelling a coherent state basis of vectors in each representation space @xmath41 are interpreted as the spin foam analogue of the missing components of the b field with modulus @xmath41 .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the _ expectation value _ of a lie algebra generator in a coherent state is given by a ( bi-)vector with modulus @xmath41 and components proportional to the coherent state parameters .",
    "however , there are still several questions unanswered about the relation between a generic b field and the lie algebra generators , the exact physical role played by coherent states , apart from their mathematical convenience , etc . moreover , since the above is a relation that concerns the expectation values of quantum operators , one may suspect that it should be understood as a semi - classical one , holding only in some approximation of the dynamics of the quantum theory . as we will discuss later on , we feel that our approach of introducing additional independent variables playing in a straightforward sense the role of the discrete b field , and whose relation with lie algebra generators for the group considered is governed by the _ dynamics _ of the theory , may help to clarify , with further work , the role that coherent states play at the level of spin foam amplitudes .",
    "+ our main concern with the identification of representation labels , and , before that , of the generators of the lie algebra , acting on connection group elements , with the discrete b field comes from looking at the issue from a more general lagrangian , rather than canonical perspective ( which is available only for trivial topology ) .",
    "namely , we are looking for a group field theory discrete realization of the path integral for a _ gravity _ theory in 1st order form , which , as we have discussed , is likely to imply a restriction on the configurations of the b field summed over , that would give a different result for the face amplitudes with respect to ( [ facebf ] ) , as it happens , for example , in the model of @xcite .",
    "in such a path integral two sets of variables are present , the geometric b field and the connection , and the relation between the two is _ one of the equations of motion _ of the theory ( the one imposing metricity of the connection ) and thus should be imposed only by the dynamics of the theory , and not imposed already at the kinematical level at the level of each history being summed over in the path integral , as it appears to be done in current gft models .",
    "we feel that imposing such condition already at the kinematical level results , in the usual spin foam models , in freezing a part of the degrees of freedom of the theory .",
    "in particular it may be this restriction is what is responsible for turning what should have been causal transition amplitudes into rather awkward , from the gft and 3rd quantization perspective , a - causal transition amplitudes , which correspond , as said , to a sort of symmetrized path integral , imposing the canonical dynamical constraints even in situations , e.g. non - trivial spacetime topologies , where a canonical interpretation is problematic and certainly not expected .",
    "+ this feeling , admittedly not much more than this , in absence of more rigorous arguments , is however confirmed by the way the new variables we introduce should be restricted in order to reduce our new gft models to the usual ones , at the level of their feynman amplitudes , i.e. spin foam models . + in any case , we would like to have at our disposal a more general framework , that reproduces the full bf or 1st order gravity path integral , in which the mutual relations between the discrete counterparts of the continuum variables mimic more closely the continuum classical and quantum dynamics . in this way",
    ", we may both confirm that we are indeed reproducing at the discrete level the features of the continuum dynamics and also , hopefully , shed some light on the usual spin foam models and procedures .",

    "we obtain a new kinetic term given by a differential operator acting on the field , very similar to the usual klein - gordon operator of scalar field theory , but with a product structure coming from the independent action of one operator of the above type acting on each argument of the field : @xmath62 .",
    "+ notice that there is almost nothing in the above choices that can select any specific dynamics of the geometric data ( @xmath35 variables and group elements , say ) at the level of the individual feynman diagram .",
    "the only dynamical ingredient above is the choice of a certain _ relation _ between them , but nothing seems to dictate , at the level of the gft action , the _ individual dynamics _ of each set of variables .",
    "what we put in is then only a ) some _ complex structure _ resulting from the propagator representing the inverse of the chosen kinetic term , due to its singular nature as a differential operator , b ) the mentioned mutual relation between @xmath35 s and @xmath63 s , and c ) the combinatorics of the feynman diagrams ( dictated by the combinatorics of the variables in the action ) .",
    "it is only to be expected , then , that the simplicial action describing their dynamics at the level of each feynman diagram , and appearing in the exponent of the phase part of the feynman amplitudes ( simplicial gravity path integral ) will be pretty generic .",
    "the non trivial tests will be to show : 1 ) that this phase can be interpreted at all as a simplicial gravity action , because of the way the gft variables will enter in it ; 2 ) that this generalized action will reduce to the usual regge action ( in 1st order form ) in appropriate , clearly identified and physically meaningful limits .",
    "our proposed formalism passes these tests .",
    "the strongest support for the mentioned choices , and for the resulting form of the gft action for the new models , is , therefore , simply the resulting expression for the feynman amplitudes of the corresponding gft , which indeed fulfill _ all _ the expectations and goals we have stated above .",
    "some additional nice features of the resulting model can be already underlined at this point .",
    "as we mentioned , the kinetic operator above is a singular differential operator , which implies that its inverse has to be defined in the complex domain , just as it happens in the usual klein - gordon case .",
    "on the one hand , this complexification is responsible for the complexity of the resulting feynman amplitudes , and ultimately , as we shall see , for the wanted exponential form of the same amplitudes ; on the other hand , the differential form introduces the dynamical correlations between simplices that we would expect in a discrete theory of quantum geometry .",
    "also , the propagator corresponding to the kinetic operator will introduce quantum corrections , virtual degrees of freedom , not captured by the on - shell condition @xmath64 , thus relaxing it at the quantum level , again matching our expectations .",
    "finally let us mention that the presence of derivatives in the gft kinetic terms allows for the identification of a non - trivial symplectic structure on the space of fields , and makes a canonical analysis _ of the gft itself _ possible .",
    "this nice feature is shared also by the generalized models introduced in @xcite , of which the new ones represent a sort of relativistic extension(fixing some pathologies of the same arising in perturbative expansion ) , as we will discuss , and it is at the basis of the canonical analysis performed in @xcite .",

    "+ finally , let us note that the fact that the amplitude diverges as @xmath281 is very appealing intuitively , as it implies that for larger triangulations it is the small values of @xmath282 that are the most relevant ones and that they become more and more dominant as we take larger and larger triangulations ( this is because the higher powers are more divergent ) .",
    "+ since we have interpreted the p variables as giving the lengths of the edges of the triangulation , this looks exactly like the behaviour one would want in order to recover a good continuum limit : for a triangulation consisting of a large number of tetrahedra , the dominant histories are those for which the basic simplices are small , corresponding moreover to a singularity in the quantum amplitudes . +    the new model is a causal one in the sense of @xcite and it shares many features of the 3d model presented in @xcite . let us briefly recall the model proposed there .",

    "although , both use the holonomies to represent the curvature and both average the b field over an edge ( and get a vector ) , the way these two objects enter into the discrete action is slightly different .",

    "the new model is _ simpler _ than the old one .",
    "it is well possible , however , that one can get a 3d model , in the same new class of gfts we are proposing , that is closer to the one in @xcite by imposing additional ( symmetry ) conditions on the variables appearing in the gft action . *",
    "the measure factor @xmath290 present in ( [ eq : partition ] ) is absent from ( [ eq : causalpartition ] ) .",
    "these are , as discussed above , corrections to the bare regge action ( and thus to the 3d bf action ) that have been here deduced from first principles and not added in an ad hoc way ( which of course could be done with ( [ eq : causalpartition ] ) ) .",
    "thus the new model is significantly richer than the old one . also with respect to this point ,",
    "we notice that there is still freedom left in choosing specific gft actions within the general class of gfts we introduced , and thus obtaining models with modified ( and possibly simpler ) path integral measures in the perturbative expansion . * due to the fact that the factor @xmath290 depends on @xmath256 , it should be clear that if we perform the integrals over the p s in ( [ eq : partition ] ) we will get dual face amplitudes which depend on the number of vertices in each dual face , i.e. each dual face amplitude is a function of @xmath256 .",
    "this however is not the case in the old model where the dual face amplitudes , which were computed explicitly in @xcite were independent of this factor .",
    "the reason for this can be traced to the following fact . at the spin foam level , and in the construction of @xcite , the basic building block of the model was considered to be the dual face . at the gft level , it is necessarily the wedge ( i.e. the portion of the dual face contained within a d - simplex ) from which everything else is constructed @xcite .",
    "the causal restriction advocated for in @xcite was a dual - face one , and this is the reason for the independence of the resulting amplitudes from the number of wedges ( vertices ) making the dual face .",
    "one would expect that if the construction in @xcite is repeated but with the causality restriction being imposed at the level of each wedge , one would obtain a model which is closer to the one reproduced here .",
    "* finally , in @xcite the causal restriction , although shown plausible , was implemented essentially by hand simply by inserting the step function into the partition function ( [ eq : causalpartition ] ) ; therefore one could be left wondering about the possibility of different ways of implementing the same type of causal restriction . in the new model(s ) we are proposing such freedom is absent , at least for given choice of gft action : the amplitudes are built , in a _",
    "unique _ manner , from the same building block , the propagator , and it is exactly the propagator that has the information about causality , orientation dependence and the propagation of quantum degrees of freedom .",

    "looking at the expression above we can see that the j s label the different poles of the dual face amplitude . since the expression for the dual face amplitude is essentially a product of feynman propagators we can think of the j variables as labelling the different semi - classical , on - shell values of @xmath241 .",

    "this is because the length information is given by @xmath241 s and these are unconstrained , in general . just like in the feynman propagator for a scalar particle",
    "the momentum is not constrained , in the quantum theory , to the mass shell .",
    "+    we can now obtain a pure spin foam expression for the feynman amplitudes of our model , i.e. one involving only the representation variables .",
    "it is not difficult to perform the integrations over @xmath298 s in ( [ eq : rspinfoamjp ] ) .",
    "the easiest way to do this is by using cauchy s formula to @xmath299 and then closing the contour in the complex plane . by jordan",
    "s lemma , since @xmath300 , the integral of the expression we have along a semicircle centered at the origin of radius r , goes to zero as r @xmath301 .",

    "let us now try to extract some physical information on the model , and in particular how it depends on the combinatorics of the underlying triangulation , starting from this expression for the amplitudes .",
    "+ consider the regime of large @xmath303 , i.e. consider the triangulations which are composed of many tetrahedra , which we have argued is one ingredient for approximating continuum physics in this setting",

    "so , if we interpret the values of @xmath304 as edge lengths , as in usual spin foam models , it is the shortest values that are the dominant ones for fine triangulations , as we would expect . in the limit of finer and finer triangulations ( which , again , we would expect to lead to a continuum approximation of the discrete path integral , then , the partition function can be reasonably well approximated by a purely combinatorial sum , with amplitudes given by the above quantities evaluated at @xmath311 , i.e. for purely equilateral triangulation with edge lengths @xmath312 .",

    "since , this amplitude is just a partition function for gravity , we thus see that there is a straightforward way of performing the wick rotationin the gravity partition function coming from the new model which does not rely on the existence of any particular time slicing .",
    "we would like to point out however , that this wick rotation(although very similar to the rotation in the squares of the edge lengths performed in causal dynamical triangulations @xcite ) is not the complete story , in the sense that it does not turn the action for lorentzian gravity into one for riemannian gravity , nor it turns complex exponentials into real ones ( thus quantum mechanical amplitudes into statistical weights ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that we have a first order theory with the b and a fields being totally independent .",
    "thus , while we wick rotate the b field to a euclidean one , we do not touch the connection . in this sense ,",

    "the same simplicial gravity path integral interpretation for the feynman amplitudes of our gft applies , and similar types of quantum corrections to the 1st order regge action are identified .",
    "we now come to deal with the four dimensional case ( d=4 ) . our discussion in this subsection and the next will be rather brief as , if we stick to ( causally restricted ) bf theory ( as opposed to gravity , in higher dimensions ) , there is little difference between the 3d and 4d cases .",
    "our main aim in the present section is indeed to show explicitly that there are no qualitative new features added to the model by going to the fourth dimension , in neither the riemannian nor the lorentzian signatures , which shows how our proposed new class of gfts behaves similarly in any dimension . as we shall see below , the four dimensional models are essentially carbon copies of the three dimensional ones .",
    "+ the only _ absolutely crucial _ difference between 3 and 4 dimensions appears , of course , when one tries to convert bf theory into a gravitational one . at the continuum level , this is done by imposing the so - called simplicity constraints on the b field , in a plebanski - like formulation of gravity .",
    "since we re interpreting the p variables as a discretized b field , the difference between having bf and gravity lies in these variables , and indeed we expect the discrete analogue of the plebanski constraints to be imposed on them , when passing to gravity @xcite , as they indeed have the needed component structure ( see the discussion in the third subsection below ) . in this work",

    "the analogue of ( [ eq : spinfoamjp ] ) is now    [ eqnarray : lspinfoamjp ] z_=(_f*t^ * _ p d^3 _ f^ * ) _ f^ * t^ * _ v^ * t^ * \\ { 15-j } ,    the poles in the expression ( [ eq : spinfoamjp ] ) are obviously located at    @xmath453    so these particular values are the preferred semiclassical areas. + finally , as in 3d there exists a simple way of performing a ( partial , as explained ) wick rotation in this model , by analytically continuing ( some components of ) the p variables .",
    "this shows that also the existence of a good wick rotation in our model is independent of the dimension .",
    "we can use this wick rotation to perform the integrals over the p s in the amplitude in the ( j , p ) variables ( equation ( [ eq : spinfoamjp ] ) ) and obtain the 4d lorentzian analogue of ( [ eq : asymptotic ] ) , which is given by    @xmath454^{n_{f^*}-1}.\\ ] ]    the relevant difference from the riemannian case is that the factor @xmath455^{n-1}$ ] , which controls the way the asymptotic behaves , gets replaced with @xmath456^{n-1}$ ] .",
    "this means that the most dominant contributions are those which satisfy @xmath457 .",
    "this does not of course force the j and the @xmath107 to each be small ( as was the case in 3d ) .",
    "however , it does force the minkowski length ( or more appropriately area ) to be small .",
    "note however , that if we restrict -by hand- to representations which are simple ( i.e. those for which either j or @xmath107 is zero ) , the expression above _ does _ force each of the parameters to be small , hinting again at a dynamical reduction to a dynamical triangulations - like sector .",
    "we have presented above a new gft model for a bf - type formulation of quantum simplicial gravity , in 4 dimensions , in the spin foam formalism .",
    "the spin foam amplitudes ( gft feynman amplitudes ) have the form , modulo a quantum measure , of the exponential of a classical 1st order action based on two types of variables : a set of bivectors associated to 2-simplices of the simplicial complex and a set of lorentz group elements representing parallel transports of a lorentz connection .",
    "the action has a regge calculus expression , augmented by higher order terms that can be interpreted as quantum corrections , that become negligible in the semi - classical limit . in this generalized simplicial gravity action , the areas as area of the corresponding triangle",
    "is , strictly speaking , not applicable until the ( discrete ) bivector is constrained to be a quadratic function of a ( discrete ) tetrad vector , as noted earlier .",
    "] of the triangles are functions of the bivectors and the deficit angle associated , again , to each triangle obtained from the holonomy of the same lorentz connection , and thus a function of the corresponding group elements .",
    "the equations of motion following variation of the dominant contribution to the action , in the semiclassical ( large distance ) limit , restrict the holonomies to be flat , just as in ordinary bf theory , but the integration over the bivectors in the path integral does not treat on equal footing positive and negative orientations for the triangles , as bf theories do . the result is a complex amplitude , as said , and not a delta function over flat connections as in bf theory . + the above model seems to us to be a very promising starting point for the construction of a gft for quantum gravity in 4 dimensions , both riemannian and lorentzian , based on the idea of gravity as a constrained bf theory @xcite .",
    "this type of formulation has been central to the construction of all spin foam models in 4d , and lots is known already about the constraints that the bivectors have to satisfy in order to admit a true geometric interpretation , i.e. to be interpretable as coming from a discretized tetrad field , as it should be in a palatini - like formulation of gravity .",
    "+ most of the model building on gfts and spin foam models from constrained bf theory have used a well - motivated but rather indirect procedure , we feel , based on the kinematical identification of bivectors with lie algebra generators , and thus translating them in constraints on the lorentz group representations and on the intertwiners appearing in the spin foam representation of the feynman amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this however , as we discussed , resulted in amplitudes with a less than straightforward relation with discrete gravity actions , and with a symmetrization over opposite orientations that is not what we should expect , we have argued , from a 3rd quantized gravity perspective .",
    "moreover , from the point of view of a path integral quantization of bf theory , the identification of bivectors with lie algebra generators acting on representation spaces remains a bit obscure , given that this holds at a quantum level while in a path integral one integrates over classical variables only ( although not solutions to the classical equations of motion ) and does not refer to quantum states if not at the boundary .",
    "a similar doubt concerns the more recent construction of spin foam models @xcite and related gfts @xcite , based on coherent states . here",
    "the geometric picture behind the chosen implementation of the constraints is much clearer , but again is justified at the quantum level in terms of the coherent states basis in each representation space . on the one hand",
    "this suggests a semiclassical validity only of the identification ; on the other hand , it results in quantum amplitudes with a less than straightforward relation with classical gravity actions , and with the same symmetrization over opposite orientations as in usual models . in the end ,",
    "the procedure adopted may well result to be correct and our doubts unfounded or settled , but we feel that further work is needed to clarify the situation , and we see our new models as a useful framework in which to do so .",
    "+ in fact , the new 4d bf - like model , thanks to the explicit presence of bivector variables and to their role in the discrete path integral clearly analogous to that played by the b field in continuum formulations , suggests that a much more straightforward way of implementing the simplicity constraints is possible .",
    "this is simply to constrain directly the integration over the bivector variables of our 4d model .",
    "the simplest way of doing so is to insert appropriate delta functions imposing the simplicity conditions on bivectors , and one has just to make sure that this is done consistently and as geometrically expected at the level of each feynman diagram . alternatively , and preferably",
    ", one should implement the constraints directly at the level of the new gft action , and for doing so one has to identify clearly which constraints are needed in each 4-simplex ( interaction term ) and which refer to the gluing of 4-simplices ( kinetic term ) , or whether one should instead constrain directly the field in both terms , as it is done for the other spin foam models @xcite .",
    "work on this is in progress @xcite .",
    "the expected result of this new way of implementing the simplicity constraints , starting from our 4d model , is to obtain a constrained gft whose feynman amplitude are given by a path integral for an action that could be directly interpreted as the discretization of the plebanski action for classical gravity , i.e. of the form : @xmath458 , where @xmath459 are lagrange multipliers imposing the constraints @xmath460 on the bivector variables @xmath461 associated to each dual face ( triangle ) @xmath33 incident to each dual vertex ( 4-simplex ) @xmath462 ( we have neglected here the quantum corrections to the 1st order regge action coming from the measure ) .",
    "+ let us stress that a result of this type would be of interest , we believe , also from a purely simplicial gravity perspective .",
    "in fact , recent progress in spin foam models has motivated work on so - called area regge calculus@xcite , i.e. a formulation of classical and quantum simplicial gravity in which the fundamental geometric variables were the areas of the triangles of the simplicial complex as opposed to the edge lengths as in traditional regge calculus .",
    "in fact , spin foam models based on constrained bf theory ended up associating , as basic geometric variables , representation labels to triangles , with the interpretation of areas of the same .",
    "it was noted @xcite , however , that , while the correspondence areas - edges works ( almost ) fine for a single 4-simplex , constraints on the areas variables are needed in order to capture correctly the simplicial geometry as soon as more than one 4-simplex is considered .",
    "the identification of these area constraints have proven to be very difficult .",
    "our model would suggest that a better formulation of classical and quantum simplicial gravity , directly following the continuum picture of gravity as a constrained bf theory , would use our bivector variables to determine the areas of triangles , and that the needed constraints needed in order to encode the geometry are constraints on these bivector variables , and not directly on the areas .",
    "more precisely , the simplicity constraints will restrict the components of the bivectors other than their modulus ( area ) , and their re - phasing in terms of constraints on areas is , if possible , certainly not straightforward . in any case",
    ", the description of simplicial geometry implicit in our models in both 3 and 4 dimensions deserves to be studied in more detail .",
    "we leave this for future work .",
    "+ the above 4d model , as well as its 3d version , in both lorentzian and riemannian versions , would also be the natural starting point for understanding in a more clear way the role that coherent states for the lorentz group play in spin foam models , and , in 4d , for understanding better the justification for the procedure used in the recently proposed spin foam models in order to impose the simplicity constraints .",
    "what we would expect is that the parameters labelling coherent states for the lorentz group in both 3d and 4d models will be directly related , if not identified , with the new ( bi-)vector variables we introduce _ in the approximation in which our free field classical equations of motions are satisfied _ , i.e. in the approximation in which one substitutes , in the amplitudes for our 3d and 4d models , the generators of the lorentz lie algebra for the ( bi-)vector variables , which indeed represents a dominant ( semiclassical ) contribution to our amplitudes , as it is clear from the structure of our propagators .",
    "however , further work is needed to confirm or refute this expectation .",
    "this work is currently in progress @xcite .",
    "we have presented a new class of gft models for the dynamics of quantum geometry , in any spacetime dimension and signature .",
    "the construction was based on the extension of the gft formalism to include additional variables with the interpretation of a discrete counterpart of the continuum b field in bf - like formulations of gravity .",
    "the feynman amplitudes for the new gfts , i.e. the corresponding spin foam models , have exactly the form of true simplicial gravity path integrals , with a clear - cut relation with discrete gravity actions , as opposed to other known models in which the connection arises only in some asymptotic limit . in 3d",
    "the new models are seen to provide a quantization of discrete quantum gravity in 1st order ( palatini ) form , in a local and discrete 3rd quantized framework in which topology is allowed to fluctuate . in 4d and higher ,",
    "the new models have the form of a 3rd quantized framework for bf theory , but with an additional dependence of the amplitudes on the orientation of the simplicial complex , of the type on would expect in a path integral quantization of 1st order gravity .",
    "+ the lorentzian models also present a very nice interplay between the two sets of discrete variables ( b field and connection ) which leads automatically to a suppression of all the configurations which do not match the simultaneous geometric interpretation of both of them .",
    "+ the gft provides also a precise prescription for the quantum correction to the classical regge - like action ( in 1st order form ) that have to be included in the corresponding path integral , in absence of further restrictions to the models .",
    "these additional terms in the action become negligible in both the continuum limit ( large number of simplices of small size ) and in the semi - classical limit ( arbitrary number of simplices but large size of simplices , thus large associated action ) , leaving only the regge action to contribute to the path integral , as one would expect . in the general case , and as soon as one goes beyond these limiting regimes , the simplicial action provided by our gft models turns into a generic @xmath1 extended action for gravity .",
    "we feel that this has several interesting implications at the simplicial gravity level as well as from a more phenomenological perspective , that deserve to be studied in more detail .",
    "+ the way the large - p limit affects the amplitudes of the new models sheds new light , we feel , on the usual large - j limit that brings usual spin foam models in closer relation with simplicial gravity path integrals , by allowing an approximation of the vertex amplitudes with the cosine of the regge action .",
    "indeed , our models suggest that this limit is a large distance limit which is equivalent , at the discrete level , to a large action and thus semi - classical limit ( because of the way the regge action , and its higher order corrections , depends on the hinge volumes ) . as such",
    ", it has two effects : it kills any quantum interference between opposite orientations for the hinges , in the usual models only , in which such opposite orientations are treated on equal footing ; it kills any short - distance effect such as @xmath463 corrections to the action , leaving only the regge term as the leading contribution to the quantum amplitudes , with next to leading order contributions being represented by inverse curvature terms @xmath464 which indeed modify the ir physics of the corresponding classical discrete gravity theory .",
    "+ let us also mention that the explicit presence of a discrete analogue of the b field in our amplitudes allows a rather transparent definition of a wick rotation in simplicial quantum gravity    our results , as we have discussed , support the view of gfts as local and discrete 3rd quantizations of gravity , providing a nice field theoretic description of the quantum dynamics of the fundamental building blocks of quantum space @xcite . also , the new models seem to implement nicely the ideas , discussed at length as a motivation for the work we have presented in this paper , as well as in @xcite , on the notion of causality and orientation dependence in quantum gravity , and to provide a definition of _ causal transition amplitudes _ for quantum gravity states , with all the expected properties .",
    "+ at a more practical level , the new 4d models represent , in our opinion , a very convenient starting point for the construction of a gft ( and spin foam , and simplicial quantum gravity ) formulation of quantum gravity as a constrained bf theory , based on a more straightforward and geometrically clean procedure of implementing the so - called simplicity constraints that reduce bf theory to gravity , than in other spin foam formulations , as we have discussed above .",
    "also , they offer a new context in which to study the low energy physics of gfts and loop quantum gravity , e.g. graviton propagator calculations @xcite .",
    "+ even more importantly , maybe , the new models , and possible modifications of the same , seem to provide the long sought for _ explicit _ unifying framework for spin foam / loop quantum gravity and simplicial quantum gravity approaches ( quantum regge calculus and dynamical triangulations ) .",
    "looking at these different approaches from the proposed common gft framework can offer , we hope , new possibilities for mutual enrichment and cross - fertilization between the various lines of research that are currently pursued as separate avenues toward a common goal , in particular regarding the outstanding issue of the continuum and semiclassical approximation of the discrete picture of quantum geometry they all seem to be based on @xcite .",
    "here we collect a few basic facts about groups @xcite used in the discussion in the main text . +",
    "a cartan subalgebra is a maximal abelian subalgebra of the lie algebra @xmath43 .",
    "the image of the cartan subalgebra under the exponential map is called a cartan subgroup .",
    "it is possible to show that all cartan subalgebras ( subgroups ) have the same dimension r , which is called the rank of the group .",
    "+ in a compact group all its cartan subgroups are conjugate to each other and any element of the group is conjugate to an element of some fixed cartan subgroup .",
    "this means that we can parametrize the conjugacy classes of the group by the elements of the cartan subalgebra .",
    "+ in a noncompact group the situation can be more complicated as on one hand not all cartan subgroups are conjugate . and the other , even if we do select a representative from each conjugacy class of cartan subgroups it is not true in general that each element of the group is conjugate to an element of one of the selected subgroups .",
    "fortunately , however , these exceptional elements form a set of measure zero in the haar measure in the cases that we are interested in . at the practical level",
    ", what follows from the above is that on a noncompact group there is no global spherical coordinate system @xcite , i.e. it is impossible to parametrize all the elements of the group by r parameters ( elements of a fixed cartan subalgebra ) like in the compact case .",
    "rather , there will be several different domains in general with all elements in each domain being conjugate to a cartan subgroup of a specific topology , with the elements which do nt lie in any domain forming a set of measure zero .",
    "the elements in each domain are parametrizable by a set of r parameters , which are just the elements of the corresponding cartan subalgebras .",
    "+ intuitively , if one uses a cartan decomposition of @xmath43 , i.e. if one writes @xmath465 , with the killing form being negative definite on the elements of @xmath466 ( the compact part as the 1-parameter subgroup generated by any element in @xmath466 is just a circle @xmath467 ) and positive definite on the elements of @xmath468 ( the noncompact part , the 1-parameter subgroup generated by any element is diffeomorphic to the real line ) ; and if one obtains a cartan subalgebra by taking e.g. k generators from @xmath466 and p ones from @xmath468 ( with k + p = r of course ) .",
    "then the cartan subgroup corresponding to this subalgebra is not conjugate to the cartan subgroup corresponding to a subalgebra formed from a different relative proportion of compact and noncompact elements .",
    "if we call the elements generated by @xmath466 rotations and the ones generated by @xmath468 boosts , then the different cartan subgroups correspond to different relative number of rotations to boosts .",
    "the r parameters which parametrize the elements in each domain are split into two classes , periodic and aperiodic .",
    "the number of periodic parameters is equal to the number of rotations while the number of the aperiodic ones is equal to the number of boosts .",
