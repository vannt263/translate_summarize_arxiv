    "recently , it was shown by burago and ivanov that metrics sufficiently close in the @xmath60 topology to the euclidean metric on a convex domain are boundary rigid @xcite .",
    "the last result implies , for example , that for any point on any riemannian manifold , a sufficiently small neighborhood of that point is boundary rigid .    in applications ,",
    "this problem is called travel time tomography and goes back at least as far as the early 20th century , when it was proposed to measure seismic waves to reconstruct an image of the inner structure of the earth . besides being used widely by geophysicists ,",

    "one motivation for magnetic boundary rigidity is that it has potential applications to problems of geometry . in the case of surfaces ,",
    "magnetic geodesics are related to the study of curves of constant geodesic curvature .",
    "this relation has been used to study the existence of closed curves with prescribed geodesic curvature ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
