    "an idea of neutrino oscillations was introduced by b.m .",
    "pontecorvo long ago @xcite . however , it took over 40 years to get the first definite experimental result in favor of oscillations @xcite .",
    "now it is firmly established that the number of the `` active '' neutrino flavors amounts to 3 ( formal fit gives 2.998@xmath40.008 @xcite ) , thus oscillations between these states are described by 3@xmath53 pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xcite .",
    "further experiments with solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrinos gave additional support to the oscillation hypothesis .",
    "recently the value of the last previously unknown mixing angle @xmath3 was measured in the daya bay experiment @xcite .",
    "some phenomenological models introduce and some experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) support the existence of @xmath6 additional ( `` sterile '' ) neutrino states that may participate in oscillations ; in that case the pmns matrix is @xmath7-dimensional .    other unsolved problems , besides the question of sterile neutrinos existence , are those of neutrino mass hierarchy and of cp violation in the leptonic sector .",
    "the decisive proof of @xmath2 appearance in @xmath0 oscillation is also still absent ; only recently the super - kamiokande experiment found the evidence for this effect @xcite .",
    "the opera experiment was designed to search for @xmath0 oscillation on event - by - event basis by observing @xmath8 decays .",
    "opera might be also handy in constraining the active - sterile neutrino mixing parameters , and the so - called non - standard interaction ( nsi ) parameters @xcite , that may give rise to @xmath2 component in the initially pure @xmath9 beam .",
    "in the present paper we review the data analysis status and the results of the opera experiment .",
    "much more detailed description of the data analysis chain is given in @xcite .",
    "for the opera hardware reference see @xcite .",
    "the status of emulsion scanning is presented in the other opera contribution in this volume @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : chain ] we present a sketch of the opera analysis procedure . in the following sections some details of simulations and analysis are given : the parameters sensitive to the primary neutrino flavor are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : param ] , the emulsion detector capabilities to reconstruct the neutrino interaction kinematical parameters are discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : est ] , the background studies are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : bckg ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cand ] we present the two first @xmath2 candidates , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : elec ]  the results concerning the @xmath1 appearance in the opera experiment .",
    "opera is a very complex hybrid detector that consists of electronic and emulsion detectors that are able to sample the event development on highly different spatial scales , starting from @xmath10 @xmath6  the lenght of the full detector  to sub - micron level needed to sucessfully identify the @xmath2 events .",
    "opera daq @xcite has a high efficiency of response to neutrino interactions contained in the detector volume ( according to @xcite , more than 95 % ) .",
    "however , most of @xmath2 signal gets lost at the further stages of the event reconstruction and analysis , and the final @xmath2 finding efficiency is about 6 - 8 % .",
    "the main steps of the standard opera event analysis chain are :    selection of contained events that have the interaction ( primary ) vertex inside the opera volume @xcite .",
    "search for the element of the emulsion detector  the so - called brick  that contains the primary vertex ( brick finding ( bf ) procedure ) @xcite    each brick contains additional attached emulsion layers ( the changeable sheets or cs ) needed to confirm the presence of charged particle tracks crossing the brick .",
    "the cs are searched for converging patterns or tracks that have an angle close to the reconstructed one from the electronic detector ( ed ) information @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in case of the positive signal",
    "the corresponding brick is analyzed .",
    "vertex location inside the brick and the event topology reconstruction .    then follows the decay search ( ds ) procedure needed to search for the signature of the short - lived @xmath8 decay to identify @xmath2 charged current ( cc ) interactions @xcite .",
    "after reconstruction of the event kinematical parameters , the kinematical selection is applied in order to further supress the background .",
    "relevant efficiencies on the different stages of analysis are defined in @xcite and revised in @xcite ; their up - to date values are discussed in @xcite .",
    "most efficiencies were estimated with dedicated mc simulations .",
    "the detector response simulation was performed using the recently introduced software framework oprelease .",
    "due to the excellent spatial resolution of the opera detector , usually a wealth of information about the event is available .",
    "here we list the main parameters that are sensitive to the primary neutrino flavor , thus making it possible to perform a @xmath2 search .",
    "let us remark that the dominating background for @xmath2 observation is charm production in @xmath9-cc interactions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : bckg ] for more details ) .",
    "the presence of muon or electron in the primary vertex allows to exclude the @xmath2 hypothesis in favor of the @xmath9-cc or @xmath1-cc interaction hypothesis , respectively .",
    "muons are usually clearly seen by the ed as long penetrating tracks ( efficiency of muon i d with opera ed is @xmath1195 % ) @xcite . in especially interesting events it is possible to follow down the tracks in other emulsion bricks to refine the muon search .    even in the case when the muon or electron in the primary vertex was missed , efficient selection of @xmath2 is still possible .",
    "it appears that the azimuthal angle @xmath12 between the @xmath8 candidate and hadronic jet is a powerful background - supressing variable , as the charmed hadron tends to follow the direction of the primary hadronic jet closely ( it is just a part of the jet ) . on the contrary",
    ", transverse momentum conservation enforces the most of leptons ( @xmath13 in @xmath9-cc events and @xmath8 in @xmath2-cc events ) to have @xmath12 values @xmath14 . in practice ,",
    "the two slightly amended versions of the @xmath12 variable definition are usable .    the so - called `` exclusive '' @xmath15 . in events with @xmath16 particles in the primary jet the track that has the largest @xmath12",
    "is removed and the @xmath12 parameter calculation is repeated to get the @xmath15 value .",
    "this exclusion procedure is intended to remove not - identified @xmath13 while calculating the @xmath15 value .",
    "even more sophisticated version of the @xmath12 parameter is the - so - called `` modified '' @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the largest @xmath12 track is excluded unless it is identified as a hadron , which allows to avoid excluding of a genuine hadron from the @xmath17 calculation .",
    "the @xmath17 distributions for the @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) decay channels are shown in @xcite ( fig .",
    "12 ) .    for the @xmath22 decay channel",
    ": if charge sign of @xmath13 from the secondary vertex is negative , then the charm background is greatly reduced .    for the @xmath20 decay channel",
    ": @xmath8 decays into charged particles and neutrinos due to lepton charge conservation , while charm decay may be neutrinoless .",
    "this affects the kinematical parameters from the secondary ( decay ) vertex , especially the transverse momentum , and allows to select a part of @xmath2 events .",
    "other parameters ( slope of the @xmath8 candidate track with respect to the primary beam direction , total momentum of the charged `` daughters '' , 3d angle between the primary jet and the @xmath8 candidate , etc ... ) are also sensitive to the neutrino flavor .",
    "it is possible to introduce multidimensional method of @xmath2 search .",
    "this method is currently under study ; it might allow to relax the kinematical cuts and ensure more effective rejection of background , thus enhancing the statistical significance of the @xmath2 observation .",
    "the most of useful kinematical information in opera comes from emulsion brick analysis .",
    "the two systems for emulsion data analysis are available : sysal ( system of salerno ) @xcite and fedra ( framework for emulsion data reconstruction and analysis ) @xcite .",
    "a well known fact is that the emulsion contains numerous grains of `` fog '' @xcite , thus one needes to establish additional selection criteria to supress the background while linking the short fragments of the tracks in single emulsion layer  the so - called microtracks .",
    "the main linking criteria demand that the microtracks must have good angular coincidence and the distance between straight lines that contain the microtracks is small .",
    "it appears that a part of the tracks from low - energy particles exhibits strong scattering in lead interleaved between the emulsion layers , and thus these tracks are not reconstructed .",
    "the microtrack linking efficiency for electrons vs. energy was calculated in @xcite and shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] ( black curve ) .",
    "additional studies with the only cut on the angle between the microtracks were performed @xcite using the geant4 package @xcite ; their results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] by blue ( 50 @xmath23 cut ) and red ( 150 @xmath23 cut ) lines with the statistical uncertainties .",
    "let us remark that the most of hadron tracks are assumed to be reconstructed starting from the minimal momentum of 100 - 300 @xmath24 or even lower .",
    "after the event topology reconstruction one can estimate the particle parameters from emulsion data . charged hadron momentum measurement with multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) method",
    "@xcite has an uncertainty @xmath1120 % for @xmath25= 4 @xmath26 and normal incidence .",
    "gamma or electron energy could be measured after reconstruction of electromagnetic showers with uncertainty @xmath2730 % for primary energy @xmath28 3 @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "electron identfication is discussed in @xcite , and p/@xmath30 separation in @xcite .",
    "prompt @xmath2 background is negligible , according to @xcite , where actually calculations for the chorus experiment were done .",
    "the chorus beam parameters are comparable with the cngs parameters .",
    "the main sources of background for oscillated @xmath2 observation are as follows :    background from @xmath9-cc events with charm production . the events with charmed hadron and low - energy muon with large angle ( @xmath281 rad ) w.r.t .",
    "the axis of the neutrino beam constitute a very dangerous background . in order to reduce this kind of background , the new methods for large - angle scanning were recently introduced .",
    "these methods allow to raise the angular acceptance of scanning microscopes from 0.60.8 @xmath31 to nearly 1.21.3 @xmath31 .",
    "extensive studies of background from inelastic hadron and muon interactions also were performed ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "background expectation for various decay channels is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "green bars denote charm background , yellow ones  background from hadronic interactions ; blue bar for the case of the muonic channel stands for large angle muon scattering ( las ) .",
    "all values are computed for the sample considered in @xcite ( `` c.s . ''",
    "stands for `` current sample '' ) .",
    "in the sample considered in @xcite two @xmath2 candidates were observed , one in the @xmath19 and the second in the @xmath21 decay channel . in both candidates",
    "the short - lived particle track was seen in emulsions ( the so - called `` long decays '' ) .",
    "the parameters of these candidates are listed in @xcite and @xcite for the first and the second candidate , respectively .",
    "the topology of the first candidate in the @xmath19 channel is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . here",
    "only the region around the vertex is shown ; the picture that shows bigger spatial region can be found in @xcite . besides the short - lived @xmath8 candidate ( `` parent '' )",
    ", the event has 5 charged long - lived hadrons from the primary vertex , one track from a neutral prompt hadron that points to the vertex , one charged hadron from decay vertex ( `` daughter '' ) and two @xmath32 showers likely from the decay vertex ( only one is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the `` parent '' and the `` daughter '' tracks form a kink . the invariant mass of the system of the 2 @xmath32 and the `` daughter '' hadron is compatible with the @xmath33 mass .",
    "similarly , the topology of the second candidate in the @xmath21 channel is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "it has the decay vertex in the plastic base .",
    "the fact that the charge number of the nuclei that constitute the plastic is much lower that for lead , as well as the density of the material , allows to supress the hadron scattering background .",
    "both candidates do nt have muon or electron from the primary vertex , and satisfy all kinematical cuts .",
    "let us note that recently the third candidate in the @xmath13 decay channel was observed .",
    "the publication with more detailed discussion of the third candidate is under preparation @xcite .",
    "the cngs beam contains a non - negligible @xmath1 prompt component ( @xmath110.8 % in terms of interactions ) , thus the opera experiment is not optimized to study @xmath1 appearance .",
    "neutrino energy estimation needed for oscillation analysis was performed with ed information .",
    "it was possible to set a bound on @xmath34 at the 90 % c. l @xcite .",
    "the constraints set on the lsnd / miniboone anomaly @xcite parameters are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "all results obtained so far are compatible with the hypothesis that all observed @xmath1 events are due to prompt component and other sources of background ( the latter was estimated as 0.4@xmath40.2 events ) .",
    "we have reviewed the present status of the opera experiment aimed on event - by - event @xmath0 oscillation search in appearance mode .",
    "three @xmath2 candidates were observed so far .",
    "the main sources of background were carefully studied .",
    "the complete simulation / analysis framework oprelease was recently established , allowing to perform more realistic mc studies .",
    "constraints on @xmath3 and the lsnd / miniboone anomaly were set profiting of the excellent particle identification capabilities of the opera detector .",
