    "the `` hydrogen atom '' problem of meson spectroscopy is the study of the pion in terms of its fundamental constituents .",
    "typically , this difficult problem is finessed by using an effective lagrangian treatment of the composite field which includes the important feature of ( almost ) spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "then one explains the presumed next highest mass meson the rho as a @xmath2 bound state and continues up the spectrum .",
    "but nowadays there is increasing support for the existence of the old `` sigma '' resonance which may be lighter than the rho .",
    "if this is true it certainly seems worthwhile to pause and examine the issue in detail .",
    "it is also a difficult problem because the sigma is in an energy range just above where one expects chiral perturbation theory to be practical but well below where asymptotic freedom permits a systematic perturbative qcd expansion .    in this talk",
    "a recent paper@xcite on the subject will be discussed .",
    "other work is referenced in that paper and in other contributions @xcite to this conference .",
    "first , a brief review of our previous results based on the non linear chiral lagrangian will be given .",
    "then we try to check the form of these results by using the linear sigma model .",
    "this model , while less general , provides the usual physical intuition about the problem as it contains a scalar nonet linked to the pseudoscalars .",
    "* pi pi scattering*@xcite .",
    "it was noted that the @xmath3 partial wave amplitude up to about 1 gev could be simply explained as a sum of four pieces : i. the current algebra `` contact '' term , ii .",
    "the @xmath4 exchange diagram iii . a non breit wigner @xmath5 pole diagram and exchange , iv .",
    "an @xmath6 pole in the background produced by the other three .",
    "this is illustrated in a step by step manner for the real part @xmath7 in figs . 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "1 that the  current algebra \" piece starts violating the unitarity bound , @xmath8 at about 0.5 gev and then runs away .",
    "however the inclusion of the @xmath4 meson exchange diagrams turns the curve in the right direction and improves , but does not completely cure , the unitarity violation .",
    "these pieces , which do not involve any unknown parameters , give encouragment to our hope that the cooperative interplay of various pieces can explain the low energy scattering . in order to fix up fig .",
    "1 we note that the real part of a resonance contribution vanishes at the pole , is positive before the pole and _ negative _ above the pole .",
    "thus a scalar resonance with a pole roughly about 0.5 gev ( above which @xmath7 in fig .",
    "1 needs a negative contribution to stay below @xmath9 ) should do the job .",
    "the result of including such a @xmath5 pole , with three parameters , is shown in fig .",
    "2 . now note that the predicted @xmath10 in fig .",
    "2 vanishes around 1 gev .",
    "thus the phase @xmath11 at 1 gev ( assumed to keep rising ) is about @xmath12 . considering this as a background phase for the known @xmath6 ,",
    "the real part of the @xmath6 contribution will get reversed in sign ( ramsauer  townsend effect ) . as fig .",
    "3 shows this is the missing piece needed to give a simple explanation of the @xmath13 @xmath14 scattering up to about 1 gev .",
    "* pi k scattering*@xcite . in this case",
    "the low energy amplitude is taken to correspond to the sum of a current algebra contact diagram , vector @xmath4 and @xmath15 exchange diagrams and scalar @xmath16 , @xmath6 and @xmath17 exchange diagrams .",
    "the situation in the interesting @xmath18 s - wave channel turns out to be very analogous to the @xmath19 channel of s - wave @xmath14 scattering .",
    "now a non breit wigner @xmath20 is required to restore unitarity ; it plays the role of the @xmath16 in the @xmath14 case .",
    "we found that a satisfactory description of the 1 - 1.5 gev s - wave region is also obtained by including the well known @xmath21 scalar resonance , which plays the role of the @xmath6 in the @xmath14 calculation .    *",
    "putative light scalar nonet*@xcite .",
    "the nine states associated with the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath6 and @xmath22 are required in order to fit experiment in our model .",
    "what do their masses and coupling constants suggest about their quark substructure ?",
    "clearly the mass ordering of the various states is inverted compared to the `` ideal mixing''@xcite scenario which approximately holds for most meson nonets .",
    "this means that a quark structure for the putative scalar nonet @xmath23 is unlikely since the mass ordering just corresponds to counting the number of heavier strange quarks .",
    "then the degenerate @xmath6 and @xmath22 which must have the structure @xmath24 would be lightest rather than heaviest .",
    "however the inverted ordering will agree with this counting if we assume that the scalar mesons are schematically constructed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a `` dual '' quark ( or anti diquark ) .",
    "this interpretation is strengthened by consideration @xcite of the scalars coupling constants to two pseudoscalars .",
    "that shows @xmath27 `` small '' , so it is a predominantly non - strange particle in this picture .",
    "furthermore the states @xmath24 now would each have two strange quarks and would be expected to be heaviest .",
    "the four quark picture was first suggested a long time ago@xcite on dynamical grounds .    * mechanism for next heavier scalar nonet*@xcite .",
    "of course , the success of the phenomenological quark model suggests that there exists , in addition , a nonet of  conventional `` p - wave @xmath2 scalars in the 1 + gev range .",
    "the experimental candidates for these states are @xmath28 , @xmath29 and for @xmath19 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these are enough for a full nonet plus a glueball .",
    "however it is puzzling that the strange @xmath21 is nt noticeably heavier than the non strange @xmath33 and that they are not lighter than the corresponding spin 2 states .",
    "these and another puzzle may be solved in a natural way@xcite if the heavier p - wave scalar nonet mixes with a lighter @xmath34 nonet of the type mentioned above .",
    "the mixing mechanism makes essential use of the ' ' bare `` lighter nonet having an inverted mass ordering while the heavier ' ' bare `` nonet has the normal ordering .",
    "a rather rich structure involving the light scalars seems to be emerging . at lower energies one may consider as a first approximation , ' ' integrating out \" the heavier nonet and retaining just the lighter one .",
    "in @xcite we employed the conventional chiral field @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a hermitian matrix of nine scalars and @xmath37 is a hermitian matrix of nine pseudoscalars .",
    "the lagrangian density is , @xmath38 the three @xmath39 s are numbers proportional to the ( current ) quark masses .",
    "@xmath40 may be considered to be an arbitrary function of the chiral @xmath41 invariants constructed from @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that most consequences at tree level follow just from chiral symmetry , irrespective of the form of @xmath40 .    * pi pi scattering amplitude*. the computed @xmath3 partial wave amplitude at tree level has the form , @xmath44 + sin^2\\psi[{\\tilde \\alpha}(s)+\\frac{{\\tilde",
    "\\beta}(s ) } { m^2_{bare}(\\sigma^\\prime)-s } ] , \\label{pipiamp}\\ ] ] where @xmath45,@xmath46 etc .",
    "are given in connection with eq ( 3.2 ) of @xcite .",
    "@xmath47 is a mixing angle between the two @xmath19 scalars , denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath48 .",
    "the subscript `` bare '' on their masses means the value at tree level . if @xmath40 is general , the three quantities @xmath47 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 may be chosen at will .",
    "however if @xmath40 is taken to be renormalizable there is only one arbitrary parameter ( say @xmath49 ) in the theory when the input set ( say @xmath51 ) is fixed .",
    "it is instructive to first go back to the widely treated two flavor case .",
    "this corresponds to choosing @xmath52 in ( [ pipiamp ] ) .",
    "then @xmath49 is the only unknown parameter . near threshold ,",
    "if @xmath49 is not too low , the amplitude is the `` current algebra '' result which agrees fairly well with experiment .",
    "it is a small quantity which emerges from an almost complete cancellation of the pole and non pole terms in ( [ pipiamp ] ) .",
    "one would like to keep this result and utilize the effect of the sigma at higher energies . since there is a true pole in ( [ pipiamp ] ) it seems reasonable to regulate this in the usual way by adding a term @xmath53 in the pole denominator .",
    "however , as achasov and shestakov @xcite pointed out , this regulation completely destroys the good current algebra result .",
    "they instead adopt the k matrix approach ( whereas the usual solution is to adopt the non linear model instead since the derivative coupling of the @xmath5 there suppresses the pole contribution near threshold ) . in this way",
    "the tree amplitude is not only regularized but made exactly unitary .",
    "one calculates the amplitude in terms of its tree value as : @xmath54 when @xmath55 is small , @xmath56 so the behavior near threshold will now not be spoiled . at the other extreme , when @xmath55 gets very large @xmath57 .",
    "note that the pole position , @xmath58 of the unitarized @xmath59 will typically correspond to mass and width ( via @xmath60 ) which differ from @xmath61 and the starting perturbative width .",
    "which one should be chosen ?",
    "since @xmath59 in ( [ kmatrix ] ) evidently has the structure of a `` bubble sum '' in field theory it seems reasonable to regard the k matrix unitarization as an approximation to including the `` radiative corrections '' .",
    "then , as in usual field theory , the pole found is interpreted as giving the physical mass and width while the values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 would have no special significance . for the two flavor model we verified the result of @xcite that a choice of @xmath49 around 0.8 to 1.0 gev would result in a physical @xmath63 around 0.45 gev and fit the first bump in fig .",
    "the physical mass is not very sensitive to the exact choice of bare mass and also the physical width is very greatly reduced .",
    "the predicted mass in this model is a bit less than the one we found in the non linear model reviewed in the previous section , but this is readily understandable as being due @xcite to the neglect of vector mesons in the present model .",
    "* three flavor linear model amplitude*. the procedure was simply to use the full two pole tree amplitude ( [ pipiamp ] ) in the unitarization formula ( [ kmatrix ] ) .",
    "we were not able to fit the entire @xmath64 amplitude shown in fig .",
    "3 up to about 1.2 gev in the renormalizable model ( which contains only the single unknown parameter @xmath49 ) .",
    "however it is easy to find a fit in the chiral model with general @xmath40 , in which we were able to choose the three parameters @xmath65 gev , @xmath66 gev and @xmath67 .",
    "the physical isoscalar masses ( after unitarization ) turned out to be 0.457 gev and 0.993 gev associated with respective widths 0.632 gev and 0.05 gev .",
    "again these represent large shifts from the bare values . for illustrative purposes the unitarized amplitude",
    "is reasonably approximated as @xmath68 neither the first ( @xmath5 ) pole nor the second ( @xmath6 ) pole is precisely of breit wigner type .",
    "however the @xmath6 pole approximates a breit wigner except for an overall minus sign , which corresponds to the well known `` flipping '' of this resonance .",
    "we similarly studied the @xmath69 scattering amplitude to find the properties of the @xmath20 resonance in the linear model .",
    "the bare mass of the @xmath20 is fixed once the input parameters are given . to allow us to vary this quantity ( in a range where the @xmath70 scattering is not much affected ) we chose the alternative input set @xmath71 and varied @xmath72 . in this case , because the @xmath21 is not included in the model we can only fit the data up to about 1 gev .",
    "it was found that the best fit corresponded to the bare @xmath20 mass about 1.3 gev .",
    "after unitarization the physical kappa mass turned out to be about 0.800 gev and this did nt change much as the bare value was varied from 0.9 to 1.3 gev .",
    "unitarization also substantially narrowed the physical kappa width .",
    "furthermore , as for the case of the @xmath5 the @xmath20 pole is not of breit wigner type .",
    "an analogous calculation was carried out to study the properties of the @xmath22 as observed in @xmath73 scattering . a summary shown in table 1",
    "compares the physical widths obtained in this linear model with those obtained in the non linear model . in the cases of the @xmath6 and the @xmath22",
    "the entries were taken from the particle data group @xcite , with which the non linear model calculations agree .       clearly , the complex pole positions and nature of the poles ( non breit wigner for @xmath5 and @xmath20 and `` ramsauer townsend '' for @xmath6 ) of the scalar nonet in the linear sigma model are similar to those obtained previously ( putative scalar nonet ) using a non linear chiral lagrangian with a different `` local '' regulation .",
    "this statement makes heavy use of the unitarization of the three flavor linear model ; otherwise the @xmath6 and @xmath20 might be considered too high and wide to belong to a light scalar nonet . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath20 clearly can not be identified with the @xmath21 in this unitarized linear sigma model .    * speculation on scalar quark structure * ( section v of @xcite ) . at an intuitive level one might expect the scalar nonet , being the `` chiral partner '' of the light pseudoscalar nonet , to have a quark- anti quark structure .",
    "it was stressed @xcite however that in the more general non linear lagrangian approach ( e.g. @xcite ) the scalar and pseudoscalar transformation properties are decoupled .",
    "only the flavor su(3 ) transformation property , not the chiral one , of the scalars is fixed in the effective non - linear lagrangian treatment .",
    "features , mentioned above , like isoscalar mixing angle and mass ordering suggest in fact the @xmath74 structure for the light scalars as an initial approximation .",
    "how might this kind of scenario play out in the linear model where the chiral properties of the scalars and the pseudoscalars are clearly linked ? even there , the quark substructure implied by the @xmath75 transformation properties of the chiral matrix @xmath42 in ( [ lagrangian ] ) is not unique @xcite ( however the @xmath76 transformations do distinguish between @xmath2 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "there are three different `` four quark '' structures with the same transformation properties .",
    "physically , they correspond to making the chiral mesons as a ) meson meson `` molecule '' b ) spin 0 diquark -spin 0 anti diquark and c ) spin 1 diquark - spin 1 anti diquark . actually these three are not linearly independent . thus the molecule @xcite and diquark- anti diquark @xcite pictures are not clearly distinguished at the effective lagrangian level .",
    "presumably , large changes in the properties of the scalars due to unitarization in the effective theory must be counted as `` four quark '' admixtures at the underlying level .    in detail",
    ", the schematic structure for the matrix @xmath78 realizing a @xmath79 composite in terms of quark fields @xmath80 can be written @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are respectively flavor and color indices .",
    "for the `` molecule '' model a ) the schematic quark structure with the same @xmath84 transformation property is , @xmath85 in the spin 0 diquark - spin 0 anti diquark case the same transformation property is realized with , @xmath86 where @xmath87 in which @xmath88 is the charge conjugation matrix of the dirac theory .",
    "finally the spin 1 diquark - spin 1 anti diquark case c ) has the schematic structure , @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "now , as discussed before , the realistic situation is likely to contain substantial mixing between scalar @xmath2 and @xmath77 nonets . to explore this",
    "we formulated a linear sigma model containing both a @xmath2 chiral matrix @xmath92 and a @xmath77 chiral matrix @xmath93 .",
    "this is a very complicated system so we started with a `` toy model '' in which all current quark masses are neglected and only a minimum number of non derivative terms are included .",
    "in addition to two minimal kinetic terms as in ( [ lagrangian ] ) , we took the simplified potential , @xmath94 here @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are positive real constants .",
    "the @xmath42 matrix field is chosen to have a wrong sign mass term so that there will be spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry .",
    "a pseudoscalar octet will thus be massless .",
    "the mixing is controlled by the parameter @xmath98 .",
    "it is amusing to note that there will then be an induced @xmath77 condensate @xmath99 in addition to the usual @xmath2 condensate @xmath100 .",
    "we found that it is easy to obtain a situation where the the next highest state above the predominantly @xmath2 nambu goldstone pseudoscalar octet is a predominantly @xmath101 scalar octet .",
    "still heavier is the predominantly @xmath101 pseudoscalar while heaviest of all is the @xmath2 scalar octet . of course , su(3 ) symmetry breaking and unitarization would be expected to modify this picture .",
    "it seems very interesting to further pursue a model of this type .",
    "there is evidently a possibility of learning a lot about non perturbative qcd from the light scalar system .",
