    "one - dimensional exactly solvable models ( spin chains , rings )  @xcite have been actively employed for studying various problems of spin dynamics  @xcite and quantum information theory  @xcite .",

    "recently , hamiltonians of the simplest inhomogeneous systems ( alternating systems ) have been diagonalised for the ring  @xcite and the linear spin chain  @xcite .",
    "development of methods for exact solution of inhomogeneous spin problems has become especially urgent in conjunction with recent progress in quantum computation and quantum information theories  @xcite . in particular , these methods can be used for studying the quantum state transfer from one end of the chain to another one  @xcite the qubit addressing problem can be attacked by variation of the larmor frequencies of different spins  @xcite in classical one - dimensional models .",
    "this immediately brings inhomogeneity into the xy model as diagonal elements of the corresponding hamiltonian are not equal .",
    "consequently , we arrive at one - dimensional spin models with hamiltonians described by three - diagonal matrices which elements on the diagonal are not - equal , and those under and over the main diagonal are not identically equal as well . low sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , which is widely applied in experimental implementation of quantum computations  @xcite , leads to a further complication of the model described above . consideration of @xmath1-qubit systems brings us naturally to the study of @xmath2 spin chains ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 is arbitrary , @xmath5 are positive integers ) , with larmor frequencies and constants of spin - spin interactions repeating periodically with period @xmath1 .",

    "for a spin chain of @xmath7 sites with periodic parameters ( period 3 ) a multiple quantum dynamics  @xcite is analysed and intensities of all mq coherences are calculated ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this analysis is based on the explicit diagonalisation of the hamiltonian of a linear 3-periodic spin chain with @xmath7 sites ( theorem  [ th3n+2 ] ) and the exact formulae , obtained in the paper ( theorem  [ trace ] ) , for the intensities of all mq coherences developed in any nuclear spin system coupled by the nearest neighbour dipolar interactions .",

    "the component @xmath317 of the corresponding eigenvector @xmath81 , satisfies  ( [ maineq ] ) , and , therefore , is uniquely determined by @xmath82 as stated in lemma  [ jlambda ] .",
    "the remaining components of the eigenvectors @xmath338 corresponding to the solutions of  ( [ equ ] ) can be reconstructed from  ( [ newu_j ] ) using corollary  [ inverse ] .",
    "finally , for the last part we observe that from lemma  [ adj ] and the property of the adjoint matrix @xmath339 @xmath340 @xmath341 @xmath342 @xmath343 where @xmath344 and @xmath345 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "we also have @xmath346 if @xmath82 is an eigenvalue for @xmath300 , then @xmath347 therefore , if @xmath217 spans the kernel of @xmath348 and @xmath349 , then vector @xmath81 with the other components given by  ( [ theother ] ) does satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath350 this completes the proof .",
    "in the paper we proposed a new one - dimensional exactly solvable model for a linear @xmath1-periodic ( in space ) open spin chain with @xmath8 sites . for the diagonalisation procedure",
    "it is important that the number of sites is @xmath351 .",
    "nevertheless , the model can serve as a good approximation for any linear periodic spin system if the number of sites in it is much more than the period .",
    "the developed method of diagonalisation of the xy - hamiltonian of inhomogeneous linear spin chains can be applied to different problems of quantum information theory [ 3,7,8 ] and spin dynamics .",
    "this method allows us to avoid matrix multiplications which are time consuming operations in the systems with large numbers of spins . in some cases we can suggest analytical methods for problems of spin dynamics instead of the known numerical ones [ 9 ] .",
    "the suggested method could also be applied to different physical and technical problems which use three  diagonal matrices  @xcite . in particular , new numerical methods of solving such problems",
    "could be worked out on the basis of the approach proposed in the paper .",
