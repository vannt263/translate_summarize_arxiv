    "many - body interaction is a key to understanding novel properties of quantum matter . as an extreme example ,",
    "the complexity due to charge , spin , and lattice interactions in high-@xmath0 superconductors makes it difficult to identify the essential microscopic ingredients for the basic model - a reason behind the current debate on the mechanism . the energy - momentum dispersion relationship measured by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) provides an excellent tool for identifying these scales .",
    "energy scales where these interactions are manifest usually provide important insights into the nature of the interactions . at an early stage",
    ", apres proved to be successful in identifying the energy scale of the d - wave gap in high - t@xmath3 superconductors @xcite . to date , a focus of the discussion in arpes has been on the nature of electron - boson coupling , which manifests itself in the form of the low energy anomaly ( `` kink '' ) near 0.03 - 0.09ev @xcite . however , little attention has been paid to the features at higher binding energies .",
    "given the strong many - body interactions and complex band structure , one expects only incoherent features and complex spectral weight modulation at high energy .",
    "the fact that one can see neatly defined momentum dependent features which are robust against doping and measuring conditions ( e.g. photon energy ) is unexpected and thus provides a new opportunity to understand many - body effects beyond what have traditionally been the points of focus by arpes , other than some early work on oxygen @xmath4 bands @xcite . here , we report arpes experiments on four families of high-@xmath0 cuprates over a wide range of dopings : bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( bi2201 ) , bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath1o@xmath7 ( bi2212 ) , ba@xmath5ca@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath7(o@xmath10,f@xmath11)@xmath1 ( f0234 ) , and la@xmath12sr@xmath13cuo@xmath9 ( lsco ) .",
    "all of their measured energy - momentum dispersion relationships reveal the simultaneous presence of three energy scales , marked as 1 - 3 in fig .",
    "1d : 1 ) the band bottom , at nearly 2 ev in optimally - doped bi2201 , which is deeper than predicted by lda calculation , 2 ) the high - energy anomaly ( hea ) at @xmath2 0.3 - 0.5 ev ( green arrow ) and 3 ) the low - energy `` kink '' ( lek ) near 70 mev ( red arrow ) which can be better seen in an enlarged energy window .",
    "various aspects of these energy scales , including the peculiar doping dependent effects , will be discussed to obtain insights on many - body interactions and their interplay in cuprates .",
    "we have measured four families of high-@xmath0 cuprates : bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( bi2201 ) , bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath1o@xmath7 ( bi2212 ) , ba@xmath5ca@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath7(o@xmath10,f@xmath11)@xmath1 ( f0234 ) @xcite , and la@xmath12sr@xmath13cuo@xmath9 ( lsco ) .",
    "the bi2201 samples are optimally - doped of tc = 35k and non - superconducting overdoped .",
    "the bi2212 samples are optimally - doped of tc = 92k and overdoped of tc = 65k .",
    "the f0234 samples are of tc = 60k . and , the lsco samples has a wide range of dopings : x = 0.03 , 0.05 , 0.063 , 0.07 , 0.075 , 0.09 , 0.12 , 0.15 , 0.22 and 0.3 .",
    "the measurements were carried out on beamline 10.0.1 at the als , using a scienta r4000 electron energy analyzer .",
    "this analyzer has the advantage of a large - angle window which can cover the band dispersion across the brillouin zone as shown in fig .",
    "we stress that the wide angle scan allowed us to record above data without resorting to manual symmetrization .",
    "the photon energies are 37 , 40 , 41, ... ,45 and 55 ev .",
    "the energy resolution between 12 and 20 mev was used for various measurements on different samples , and the angular resolution is 0.3 degree .",
    "the samples were cleaved in situ in vacuum with a base pressure better than @xmath14 torr .",
    "the samples were measured both in normal and superconducting states .",
    "lda results here are based on full - potential well - converged computations for the appropriate lattice structures , described in greater details in ref.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "1a shows the raw arpes image of the strongly overdoped bi2201 sample while its raw momentum - distribution - curves ( mdc ) and energy - distribution - curves ( edc ) are shown in fig .",
    "1b and c , respectively . to see the band near the bottom more clearly",
    ", the raw arpes image is divided by its profile of angle - integrated edc @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "1d ; this procedure will not change the mdc - peak position at any given energy .",
    "we also note that this renormalization procedure which is used in fig .",
    "1d - h and fig.2 is only for the purpose of displaying the lower and higher energy features together since otherwise the intensity at the higher - energy region will be too high to have a reasonable displaying contrast .",

    "[ t ]   the comparison of normalized arpes spectra and lda calculations along ( a ) ( @xmath15 , @xmath15 ) to ( 0,0 ) or nodal direction and ( b ) ( 0,0 ) to ( @xmath15 , 0 ) or antinodal direction in od non - superconducting bi2201 system .",
    "( c ) shows the agreement of arpes spectrum and lda calculation of high - energy band when shifting the lda by 450 mev to the higher energy .",
    "( d ) the comparison of the spectra at photon energies , e@xmath16 = 40 , 45 and 55 ev where the green shaded region denotes the energy scale of hea and blue shaded region indicates the top of the band b. we note that for e@xmath16 = 55 ev , due to the matrix element effect , the intensity of the left band b is large and therefore we have adjusted the color scale so that we can see the energy scales of both band a and b clearly.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    as shown in fig . 1e-1h , arpes spectra of optimally - doped ( op ) and overdoped ( od ) samples of bi2201 and bi2212 systems are overlaid on the corresponding lda calculations . as seen in all measured samples , the first peculiar feature , especially at lower doping ,",
    "is that the arpes band width is found to be wider than lda calculation .",
    "this is anomalous as one expects interactions to enhance the mass and reduce the band width . by extrapolating the band ( e.g. the red dashed line in fig .",
    "1d ) , one can get an estimate of the band width that is suitable for qualitative discussion . with doping",
    ", the discrepancy between the band widths obtained from arpes and lda seems to be reduced .    additional evidence that these high energy dispersions still contain useful information comes from band b in fig .",
    "1a which shows a maximum at @xmath17 point near 1 ev .",
    "this band has a correspondence to an lda band and thus provides confidence in the data at higher energy scales , which has been largely unexplored in the cuprates . from the lda calculation with orthorhombic distortion ,",
    "this band is the band at y point ( left arrow , fig .",
    "2c ) , which is folded around the @xmath18 point .",
    "we then compare the lda and arpes top part of this band b at @xmath17 point by shifting the lda band down . a good agreement of arpes and lda of this concave - down band ( see fig .",
    "2c ) can be obtained if the lda is shifted down @xmath2 0.45 ev for od bi2201 sample and the shifted energy increases to @xmath2 0.8 ev for op bi2201 sample@xcite , leading to a filled band width near 2 ev .",
    "a similar behavior is also observed in the bi2212 system @xcite ( fig .",
    "this band width enhancement was also seen earlier in undoped ca@xmath5cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 ( ccoc ) as its high - energy dispersion matches with the lda calculation shifted by  0.7 ev @xcite .",
    "( a ) shows mdc - peak dispersion plotted on top of arpes spectrum and ( b ) shows corresponding mdc width in op bi2201 system ( t@xmath3 = 35k ) .",
    "( c)-(f ) show the mdc - derived dispersions of bi2201 ( tc = 35k ) , bi2212 ( tc=65k ) , lsco(tc=38k ) and f0234 ( tc=60k ) respectively .",
    "additionally , the temperature dependence of bi2212 and lsco dispersion is shown in ( d ) and ( f).,width=240 ]          next , we discuss the high energy anomaly ( hea ) near 0.3 - 0.5 ev . we extract the mdc peak position by fitting to lorentzian curves , as shown by the red and blue curves in fig .",
    "2a and 2b .",
    "we note that especially at high - binding energy , mdc peak position may not represent the real dispersion .",
    "explained in appendix , a full 2d analysis , which directly extracts the spectral function , @xmath19 and matrix element term separately at once , can avoid the problem of the mdc or edc analysis alone .",
    "however , since the kink - like structure is so large , the mdc - derived dispersion should be able to approximately identify the energy scale of the hea . to check the 3 dimensional behavior of the band a and b",
    ", we perform the measurements at various photon energies 40 , 41 , ... , 45 ev and 55 ev , probing different perpendicular momenta @xmath20 . as shown in figs .",
    "2d , we find that hea scale and the top of band b are not very sensitive to the photo energies while as well these energy scales in our lda calculations do not show strong @xmath20 dependence .",
    "this hea is present in various cuprate families . while earlier seen in undoped ccoc @xcite , the mdc - peak - position graphs of bi2201 , bi2212 , lsco and f0234 plotted in fig .",
    "3 , reveal its universality .",
    "the energy scales are around 0.3 - 0.4 ev in bi2201 , bi2212 and lsco while around 0.5 - 0.6 ev in f0234 ( for electron - doped band ) .",
    "hea persists in both superconducting and non - superconducting samples , albeit its strength depends on doping .",
    "4 shows the plots of mdc - peak position of lsco samples which cover a wide doping range , x = 0.03 to 0.30 . from the figure ,",
    "the hea energy does not change much with doping . however , if we define the size of hea to be the difference between the mdc - derived and lda dispersion , it increases upon doping in this range .",
    "similar doping - dependent behavior is also observed in bi2201 and bi2212 samples which cover a narrower range of doping . for superconducting samples ,",
    "the hea persists above and below tc .",
    "consistent with arpes data , from in - plane optical conductivity of bi2212 @xcite , norman and chubukov recently report that the real part of the self - energy is large with a maximum value around 0.3 - 0.4 ev @xcite .      finally , the low energy `` kink '' ( lek ) around 0.03 - 0.09 ev is indicated with arrows in fig .",
    "2d , and upper arrows in fig .",
    "4 and fig .",
    "5a . since this feature has been already discussed with regard to the interaction of electron to sharp bosonic mode(s )",
    "@xcite , we will not go into the details of this feature , except commenting upon its interesting doping dependence . for lek",
    ", the size of this feature , which is interpreted as strength of electron - boson coupling , reduces upon doping in lsco @xcite and bi2201 @xcite while the size of hea defined previously increases upon doping .",
    "it is then intriguing to ask whether an interplay of these two scales of low and high - energy anomalies will affect our understanding of the doping dependent effects seen in cuprates .",
    "comparison of electronic structures of three perovskites in ( a ) superconducting ( sc ) ,",
    "( b ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) and ( c ) ferromagnetic ( fm ) phases .",
    "the images show arpes data of ( a ) optimally - doped bi2201 , ( b ) undoped ccoc , and ( c ) lsmo.,width=345 ]    the presence of three energy scales in the same data set hints at the hierarchy of interactions that are important to the dynamics of electrons in cuprates . aside from lek which we believe is caused by electron - phonon interaction @xcite , hea and the expanded band width",
    "are new observations that require more discussion .    to gain more insights into the nature of the energy scales observed , fig .",
    "5 compares the data of the superconducting ( sc ) sample , op bi2201 , with that of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) parent compound ccoc and ferromagnetic ( fm ) la@xmath21sr@xmath22mn@xmath1o@xmath23 ( lsmo ) .",
    "comparison of lsmo and cuprates may give us some insight since lsmo is reported to have similar pseudogap behavior @xcite .",
    "the lsmo comparison yields two insights : i ) hea is probably related to antiferromagnetism as it is absent in the ferromagnetic state and ii ) the lda calculation apears to give a correct band width if antiferromagnetism is not present . as for lek near 0.03 - 0.09 ev , it is seen in metallic cuprates and lsmo but not in insulating ccoc where the polaron effect is too strong , thus suppressing the quasiparticle weight dramatically @xcite .",
    "hea may be related to the short range coulomb interaction as in the hubbard ( or t - j ) model .",
    "calculations using these models show that in undoped sr@xmath5cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 , the quasiparticle band width of the part below hea is set by the j scale to be around 2 - 3 j @xmath24 0.25 - 0.35 ev @xcite while the higher energy part is presumed to be the incoherent band with t scale @xcite .",
    "hea in the hubbard calculation , which may come from the meeting of the quasi - particle band and the incoherent lower - hubbard band , can be seen from the slightly underdoped to overdoped regime @xcite ; however , a further check still remains in the small doping regime where the calculation is challenging . in srvo@xmath25 ,",
    "a feature similar to hea is seen in arpes @xcite and in lda+dmft calculation @xcite . with these models , the size of hea",
    "is expected to be less pronounced upon doping @xcite which is opposite to the doping effect we see in fig .",
    "4 .    one possible way to understand the anomalous doping dependence could be the interplay between electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions .",
    "this drives the system into the polaronic regime in the underdoped samples @xcite , making a quantitative analysis of the size of the hea difficult because obtaining polaronic physics correctly via an mdc analysis is challenging . since the polaron physics is very strong in lightly - doped regime , this may artificially suppress the hea size .",
    "another possibility is that hea comes from the renormalization effect by bosonic mode(s ) .",
    "the in - plane plasmon and the two - magnon mode are two possible candidates .",
    "the coupling strength of in - plane plasmon increases upon doping , as shown by the energy - loss function in ref .",
    "the in - plane plasmon should give a very similar doping effect to that shown in fig .",
    "the problem is that the plasmon mode energy in lsco is around 0.8 ev , or twice as large . on the other hand ,",
    "the two - magnon mode energy is right in the window for the hole - doped cuprates (  0.3 - 0.4ev ) but not for fo234 , electron - doped band (  0.5 - 0.6 ev ) while its strength quickly reduces upon doping @xcite .",
    "given the above alternative interpretations and issues related to them , despite the quantitative problem of the hea size as a function of doping , the anomalous energy scale is still likely caused by the mott - hubbard physics .",
    "the fact that hea is absent in fm lsmo ( fig .",
    "5 ) but present in the mott - hubbard system srvo@xmath25 suggests that it is related to antiferromagnetism and mott - hubbard physics .    next is the enhancement of lda band width which is anomalous because interactions usually reduce the band width . one possible candidate here",
    "could be the poor screening effect .",
    "with the hartree - fock equation of free electron , the coulomb exchange term without the screening effect @xcite will give rise to a negative term which results in an increased band width ; the effect of poor screening can be seen in semiconductors . in cuprates , the electrons in lightly - doped systems",
    "are poorly screened compared to the overdoped regime and hence the discrepancy of band width is larger in underdoped systems .",
    "we note here that , for the srvo@xmath25 system , lda+dmft calculation @xcite gives the band width correctly .",
    "this distinction between srvo@xmath25 and cuprates should be investigated further .",
    "in conclusion , based on data from four families of cuprates over a wide doping range , we present evidence of a hierarchy of multiple energy scales in cuprates focused on : the low energy anomaly of 0.03 - 0.09 ev , a high energy anomaly of 0.3 - 0.5 ev , and an anomalous enhancement of lda band width , extending over an energy scale of @xmath2 2 ev . these results suggest that electron - phonon interaction , short - range coulomb interaction and poor screening should be all considered to understand the nature of cuprates .",
