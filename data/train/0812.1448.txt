    "this indicates that the fundamental structures of quasars such as accretion disks and hot - dust tori had been already established during the first billion years of cosmic history",
    ". however , the origin and nature of dust in the high - redshift universe are not necessarily the same as those in our galaxy .",
    "in fact maiolino et al .",
    "( 2004a ) have found that the rest - frame uv extinction curve observed for the quasar sdss j1048 + 4637 at @xmath5 is quite different from those in local galaxies , suggesting that the source and evolution of dust at high redshifts ( @xmath1 ) are different from those at low redshifts ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "dust grains in the early universe have great impacts on the formation processes of stars and galaxies .",
    "dust grains control the chemistry of the ism by locking up a large fraction of refractory elements and by serving as catalysts for chemical reactions of gas .",
    "especially they foster the formation of hydrogen molecules on their surfaces ( cazaux & tielens 2004 ; cazaux & spaans 2004 ) , enhancing the star formation rate ( sfr ) in metal - poor star - forming gas clouds ( hirashita & ferrara 2002 ) . in dense metal - poor molecular clouds , dust grains",

    "dust grains also influence the thermal balance in the interstellar space by producing photoelectrons that heat the gas and by reemitting the absorbed stellar light at infrared wavelengths .",
    "the reprocessing of stellar light by dust at high redshift is also crucial in understanding the structure formation history of the universe from relevant observations .",
    "obscuration of stellar light by dust leads to a serious misleading in interpreting the cosmic sfr and the imf of the very early generation of stars from the cosmic infrared background radiation ( e.g. , hauser & dwek 2001 ) .",
    "thermal emission from high-@xmath11 dust dominates the far - infrared background radiation and can even distort the cosmic microwave background radiation ( loeb & haiman 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the investigation of dust in the early universe is one of the most important subjects to reveal the nature of stellar populations and underlying physical processes at the dark age of the universe .    in the previous studies that assessed the effects of dust grains at high redshift ,",
    "the composition and size distribution of dust grains were assumed to be the same as those in our galaxy , and their amount was treated as a parameter ( e.g. , loeb & haiman 1997 ) . however , the physical processes involving the interactions of dust with photons and gas are sensitive to the chemical composition and size of dust . the size distribution and amount of dust",
    "are determined by the competition between its production and destruction and vary with time according to the star formation activity .",
    "therefore , in order to evaluate the impacts of high-@xmath11 dust , it is essential to clarify the evolution of dust in the early epoch of the universe by taking account of the formation and destruction of dust self - consistently .    at redshift",
    "larger than 5 when the cosmic age is less than 1.2 billion years , the formation of dust in mass - loss winds from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars is too inefficient to supply a copious amount of dust into the ism because most of low - mass stars can not evolve off the main sequence in such an early epoch .",
    "hence , the main formation sites of dust are considered to be in the ejecta of type ii sne ( sne ii ) evolving from short - lived massive stars with the progenitor masses @xmath12 840 @xmath0 .",
    "indeed the chemical evolution models point out that 0.11 @xmath0 of dust per sn ii event is required to form to explain a large content of dust observed in high - redshift galaxies ( morgan & edmunds 2003 ; maiolino et al .  2006 ; dwek et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand , numerical simulations ( e.g. , bromm et al .  2002 ; abel et al .  2002 ; yoshida et al .  2006 ) and semi - analytic models ( nakamura & umemura 2001 , 2002 ) have shown that the first stars formed out of the primordial composition of gas are typically very massive with masses more than 100 @xmath0 .",

    ", we describe the properties of dust in the early universe revealed by a series of our studies ; the calculations of dust formation in the ejecta of primordial sne ii and pisne are presented in   2 , and the evolutions of dust in those snrs are described in   3 . in   4 we discuss the role of dust in the early universe , focusing on the impacts of dust on the formation processes of the next generation of stars . in   5 the extinction curve expected at high redshift",

    "the concluding remarks are presented in   6 .",
    "in the expanding ejecta of sne , dust grains can condense through the formation of seed nuclei and their growth by the collisions with the gas in the metal - rich he core . based on the nucleation and grain growth theory by kozasa & hasegawa ( 1987 ) , kozasa et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1991 ) demonstrated the formation sequence of dust in the ejecta of sn 1987a .",
    "they also discussed that the composition of dust grains formed in the ejecta is controlled by the elemental composition of gas at their formation sites and that their radii and number densities strongly depend on the time evolution of gas temperature in the ejecta .    applying the method of dust formation calculations by kozasa et al .",

    "they assumed one - zone models for the composition and density of gas within the he core , adopting the elemental yields for sne ii with @xmath14 1235 @xmath0 by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "considering the formation and destruction of co and sio molecules , todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) showed that c grains can condense along with silicate and oxide grains in the o - rich environment and that their size distributions are lognormal - like with the typical radii of 0.03 @xmath15 m for c grains , 0.002 @xmath15 m for fe@xmath16o@xmath17 grains , and 0.001 @xmath15 m for mgsio@xmath16 and mg@xmath18sio@xmath17 grains .",
    "the total mass of dust formed ranges from 0.08 @xmath0 to 2 @xmath0 depending on the progenitor mass and metallicity .",
    "it should be noted that the one - zone uniform model for gas density and elemental composition with the same time evolution of gas temperature tuned by comparing with the observation of sn 1987a is not always applicable to clarify the dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 on the total mass , chemical composition and size of dust formed in the ejecta .",
    "we investigated the condensation of dust in population iii sne ii and pisne ( nozawa et al .",
    "2003 ) , adopting the hydrodynamic models and the results of nucleosynthesis calculations by umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) .",

    "the gas temperature is calculated for each model by solving the radiative transfer , taking account of the energy deposition from radioactive elements .",
    "the formation of co and sio molecules is assumed to be complete .",
    "our results of dust formation calculations show that there is a great difference in the species of dust formed in the sn ejecta between the unmixed case and the mixed case . in the unmixed case , various grain species condense reflecting the difference of elemental composition in each layer : c grains in carbon - rich he layer , mg@xmath18sio@xmath17 , al@xmath18o@xmath16 , and mgo grains in o - mg - si layer , mgsio@xmath16 , al@xmath18o@xmath16 , and sio@xmath18 grains in o - si - mg layer , si and fes grains in si - s - fe layer , and fe grains in the innermost fe - rich layer . in the mixed case , where the oxygen atoms are more abundant than carbon atoms , only silicates ( mgsio@xmath16 , mg@xmath18sio@xmath17 , sio@xmath18 ) and oxide ( al@xmath18o@xmath16 and fe@xmath16o@xmath17 ) grains form .",
    "figure 1 shows the differential size distribution of each dust species summed up over its formation region in the unmixed and mixed cases for sne ii ( figs .",
    "1_a _ and 1_c _ ) and pisne ( figs .  1_b _ and 1_d _ ) . in the unmixed case ,",
    "the size distributions of c , sio@xmath18 , and fe grains are lognormal - like with relatively large radii ( @xmath24 @xmath15 m ) , while the other grain species have power - law - like distributions with radii ranging a few orders of magnitude . in the mixed ejecta ,",
    "the size distribution function of dust formed is almost lognormal - like except for al@xmath18o@xmath16 grains .",
    "the average radius of dust for the mixed case is a little smaller compared with that for the unmixed case , although the maximum radius of dust is limited to less than 1 @xmath15 m in both cases .",
    "the main species of newly formed dust and their size distribution functions are almost independent of the progenitor mass .    the total mass of dust formed in the ejecta of primordial sne is shown in figure 2 for the unmixed case ( fig .",
    "2_a _ ) and the mixed case ( fig .",
    ". in general , the total mass of dust is higher for the mixed case than the unmixed case because oxygen atoms are more efficiently locked into dust grains as silicates and oxides in the mixed case .",
    "the total mass of dust formed is 0.12 @xmath0 for type ii sne and 2560 @xmath0 for pisne and increases with increasing the progenitor mass .",
    "the depletion factor , defined as the mass fraction of metal locked into grains to metal available in the ejecta , is 0.050.25 for sne ii and 0.450.55 for pisne .",
    "therefore , pisne can convert a much larger fraction of refractory elements into dust grains than sne ii .",
    "note that the yields of dust in pisne are consistent with the results by schneider et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who extended the model of dust formation in sne ii by todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) to pisne , adopting the nucleosynthesis results by heger & woosley ( 2002 ) .",
    "before newly formed dust grains in the ejecta are injected into the ism , they can be processed in the hot gas swept up by the reverse and forward shocks that are generated by the interaction between the sn ejecta and the surrounding medium .",
    "dust grains condensed in the he core initially expand with the gas , but once they encounter the reverse shock , they acquire high velocities relative to the gas and are eroded by sputtering in the shocked gas .",
    "dust grains are also decelerated by the gas drag , and some of them are trapped in the hot plasma and are completely destroyed by sputtering .",
    "the deceleration rate and erosion rate of dust depend on the temperature and density of gas and the relative velocity of dust to gas , as well as the composition and size of dust .",
    "therefore , in order to reveal the composition , size distribution , and amount of dust supplied from sne into the ism , we need to investigate the motion and processing of dust within snrs , based on the physical properties of dust obtained by the dust formation calculations .",
    "bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) have semi - analytically investigated the destruction of newly formed dust through the passage of the reverse shock , by revisiting the models of dust formation by todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) and by employing a little different size distribution of dust from their results .",
    "bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) found that the size distribution of dust surviving the reverse shock is skewed to smaller radius in comparison with the original one .",
    "the mass of surviving dust is 220 % of the initial dust mass and decreases with increasing the gas density in the ambient medium .",
    "however , in the calculations , they did not consider the motion of dust outwardly penetrating through the shocked hot gas , which is a very important process to pursue the evolution and survival of dust within snrs .",
    "their calculations are preformed only up to @xmath25 10@xmath26 years .",
    "we investigated the evolution of dust in primordial snrs ( nozawa et al .",
    "2007 ) , by adopting the results of dust formation calculations by nozawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and by carefully treating the dynamics of dust and its destruction by sputtering . here",
    "we briefly introduce the method of calculation ; the deceleration rate of dust due to the gas drag is inversely proportional to the grain radius and bulk mass density .",
    "the erosion rate by sputtering is evaluated by applying the sputtering yield for each dust species given in nozawa et al .",
    "dust grains being treated as test particles , the transport and destruction of dust are calculated in a self - consistent manner by taking account of the size distribution and spatial distribution of each grain species formed in the ejecta .",
    "the time evolution of gas temperature and density in snrs is numerically solved by assuming spherical symmetry and considering the cooling of gas via the atomic process , the inverse compton , and the thermal radiation of dust .",
    "for the initial conditions of gas in the ejecta , we adopt the hydrodynamic models of population iii sne ii and pisne by umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) , which are the same as those used in the dust formation calculations .",
    "we assume the uniform ambient medium with a gas temperature of @xmath27 k based on the studies of the radiative feedback from massive primordial stars ( kitayama et al .  2004 ;",
    "machida et al .  2005 ) . to examine the dependence of the evolution of dust on the gas density in the ism",
    ", we consider the hydrogen number densities of @xmath28 0.1 , 1 , and 10 @xmath29 for the ambient gas density .",

    "the positions of the forward and reverse shocks are indicated by the arrows in the upper and lower panel , respectively , at given times after explosion .",
    "we can see that the gas swept up by the forward and reverse shocks is heated to the temperature of @xmath32@xmath33 k , where dust grains are efficiently eroded by sputtering ( see fig .  2 in nozawa et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "figure 4 exhibits the trajectory of dust ( _ upper panel _ ) and the time evolution of dust radius relative to the initial one ( _ lower panel _ ) within the snr given in figure 3 .",
    "the thick solid curves in the upper panel depict the trajectories of the reverse and forward shocks .",
    "the evolution of dust within the snr is shown for c , mg@xmath18sio@xmath17 , and fe grains formed in the unmixed case .",
    "initially dust grains are expanding with the gas , and then collide with the reverse shock at different times depending on their initial positions : at 3650 yr for c grains formed in the outermost he core , at 6300 yr for mg@xmath18sio@xmath17 grains in the o - rich layer , and at 13,000 yr for fe grains condensed in the innermost he core .",
    "once dust grains intrude into the reverse shock , the evolution of dust heavily depends on the composition and initial radius @xmath34 ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "grains with the initial radius of @xmath35 0.01 @xmath15 m ( _ dotted lines _ ) are efficiently decelerated by the gas drag and are trapped in the hot gas between the reverse and forward shocks .",
    "these small grains are completely destroyed by sputtering in the shocked gas .",
    "grains of @xmath35 0.1 @xmath15 m ( _ dashed lines _ )",
    "reduce their sizes by sputtering but are finally trapped in the dense shell formed behind the forward shock at @xmath36 years without being completely destroyed . fe grains of @xmath35 0.1 @xmath15 m are injected into the ambient medium because of their high bulk density .",
    "grains with @xmath35 1 @xmath15 m ( _ solid lines _ ) can maintain their high velocities and pass through the forward shock to get injected into the ambient medium without being eroded significantly .    in figure 5",
    ", we show the size distribution function of each dust species surviving the destruction in snrs .",
    "figure 5_a _ presents the size distribution of dust in the unmixed case after destruction for @xmath37 @xmath0 and @xmath31 @xmath29 , and figure 5_b _ for @xmath38 @xmath0 and @xmath39 @xmath29 .",
    "because small grains are efficiently trapped in the hot gas and are predominantly destroyed by sputtering , the size distribution of surviving dust is greatly deficient in small - sized grains , compared with that at its formation for both cases of sne ii and pisne ( see figs .",
    "1_a _ and 1_b _ for their initial size distributions ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that relatively large - sized grains inhabit the interstellar space in the early universe , where dust grains are supplied only by sne ii and pisne .",
    "the behaviors of size distribution of surviving dust do not depend on the progenitor mass for sne ii because the explosion energy is the same ( @xmath40 ) and thus the time evolution of temperature and density of gas in a snr is similar .",
    "for @xmath31 @xmath29 , the critical radius below which dust is completely destroyed is @xmath70.05 @xmath15 m although it weakly depends on the dust species and their initial positions . for pisne ,",
    "the critical radius is approximately three times higher than that for sne ii as the result of much higher explosion energy ( @xmath41@xmath42 ergs ) and more massive hydrogen envelope compared to sne ii .",
    "the evolution of dust in snrs is also affected by the ambient gas density .",
    "a higher ambient density results in denser shocked gas , which causes the efficient erosion and deceleration of dust due to more frequent collisions with the hot gas . hence , the critical radius for each dust species increases with increasing ambient gas density : @xmath70.01 @xmath15 m for @xmath39 @xmath29 and @xmath70.2 @xmath15 m for @xmath43 @xmath29 . accordingly",
    ", the total mass of surviving dust decreases with increasing gas density in the ism , as shown in figure 2 . for @xmath43 @xmath29 ,",
    "the mass of surviving dust is less than 0.1 @xmath0 for all models considered here , and all or almost all ( @xmath44 85 % ) of the dust grains formed in the ejecta are destroyed .",
    "the mass fraction of dust destroyed is generally larger for the mixed case than the unmixed case because the mass of dust formed in the mixed case is somewhat weighted toward smaller size than that in the unmixed case .",
    "it can be also seen from figure 2 that the mass fraction of dust destroyed in remnants of pisne is much larger than in sne ii .",
    "this is because the critical radius is large and the average radius of dust formed is relatively small for pisne . nevertheless , for @xmath39 and 1 @xmath29 , the mass of dust surviving the destruction is between 0.1 @xmath0 and 15 @xmath0 , which is high enough to account for the dust budget observed in the host galaxies of quasars at @xmath1 ( maiolino et al .",
    "2006 ; dwek et al .",
    "thus , we conclude that sne ii and pisne are the important dust factories in the early universe .",
    "it should be mentioned here that although we have focused on population iii sne , the results of the present study could be useful for evaluating the composition , size distribution , and mass of dust ejected from sne ii with high metallicity of the progenitors .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that the species of dust formed in the ejecta of sne ii and their size distribution are insensitive to the metallicity of the progenitor stars ( todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa 2003 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the increase of the metallicity in the ambient medium enhances the cooling in the shocked gas and affects the efficiency of dust destruction in a snr .",
    "however , even if we calculate the evolution of dust within a snr for the ambient medium with solar metallicity , the destruction efficiency of each grain species decreases at most by 15 % compared with that for the primordial gas composition ( nozawa et al .  2007 ) . therefore , the results of calculations described here can be also applicable to type ii - p sne in the local universe , regardless of the initial metallicity of progenitor stars and ambient medium .",
    "in the previous sections , we have shown that dust grains can condense even in the ejecta of population iii sne ii and pisne evolving from zero - metal progenitor stars (   2 ) and that a sufficient fraction of newly formed grains can survive the destruction in the snrs as long as the gas density in the surrounding medium is not very high (   3 ) .",
    "this indicates that dust grains are surely ejected from primordial sne and can quickly enrich the ism in the early universe . in this section",
    "we describe the fundamental role that the first cosmic dust plays in the formation processes of the subsequent generations of stars .",
    "the theoretical studies investigating the collapse and fragmentation of the primordial gas ( e.g. , bromm & larson 2004 and references therein ) have predicted that the characteristic mass of the first stars is very high , probably in excess of 100 @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "a typical mass of population i and ii stars seen in the present days is as low as @xmath71 @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in the course of cosmic history , there should have been the transition of star formation mode from massive population iii stars to low - mass population ii stars .",
    "the fundamental quantity responsible for this transition is the initial metallicity of collapsing gas clouds ( yoshii & sabano 1980 ; omukai 2000 ) .",
    "the presence of metals largely enhances the cooling efficiency of gas and governs the thermal and chemical evolution of low - metallicity clouds . if the initial metallicity reaches a critical value @xmath45 , the protostellar clouds become gravitationally unstable at higher densities where the jeans masses are correspondingly lower , and undergo fragmentation to produce low - mass gas clumps .",
    "bromm et al .",
    "( 2001 ) computed the evolution of pre - enriched star - forming gas clouds and found that the critical metallicity is likely to be @xmath46 @xmath10 .",
    "also , bromm & loeb ( 2003 ) and santro & shull ( 2006 ) have derived the critical abundance of each heavy element such as c , o , si , and fe , above which the fragmentation of gas clouds is caused by fine - structure line cooling of the individual heavy element .",
    "it should be noted here that if a significant fraction of metals are locked into dust grains , cooling by thermal emission of dust is more efficient than metal line cooling in the dense metal - poor molecular clouds .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "( 2006a ) investigated the thermal history of collapsing gas clouds , developing the calculations by omukai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and adopting the models of dust formed in primordial sne ii by todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) and pisne by schneider et al .",
    "they concluded that the efficient cooling of gas by dust grains enables fragmentation of gas clouds into solar or sub - solar mass scales even at @xmath47 @xmath10 .",
    "their calculations are based on one - zone models for the evolution of clouds , but this prediction is confirmed by the 3-d hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "tsuribe & omukai ( 2006 ) studied the dynamical collapse and fragmentation of gas clouds with @xmath4810@xmath49 @xmath10 and showed that the core of prestellar clouds actually fragments into small gas clumps .",
    "therefore , dust produced in primordial sne plays a critical role in the formation of the first low - mass stars in the universe .      in the halo of our galaxy ,",
    "many extremely metal - poor ( emp ) low - mass stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath50 have been discovered so far .",
    "in particular , two hyper - metal - poor ( hmp ) stars , he 01075240 ( christlieb et al .  2002 ) and he 13272326 ( frebel et al .",
    "2005 ) with [ fe / h ] @xmath51 , and an ultra - metal - poor ( ump ) star , he 05574840 ( norris et al .  2007 ) with [ fe / h ] @xmath52 , are considered to be very early generation of stars .",
    "the most iron - deficient hmp stars show extreme ( @xmath53100 times ) overabundances of c and o and modest ( 1100 times ) enhancements of si and mg , and several scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of their peculiar elemental compositions ( beers & christlieb 2005 and references therein ) . here",
    "we would suggest one possibility that dust grains newly formed in primordial sne are responsible for the elemental compositions of these low - mass stars , considering that they are the second generation of stars formed in the dense shell of primordial snrs , which are referred to as population ii.5 stars ( mackey et al .",
    "2003 ; salvattera et al .",
    "2004 ; machida et al .",
    "2005 ) .    as demonstrated in   3 , the results for the evolution of dust within a snr show that the dust grains surviving the destruction but not injected into the ambient medium are accumulated in the dense shell behind the forward shock after 10@xmath26 to 10@xmath30 years .",
    "the existence of dust in the shell may make possible the formation of stars with solar mass scales through its thermal emission if its metallicity is above 10@xmath54 @xmath10 , as shown in the last subsection . in that case",

    "we show only the results calculated for the unmixed case of sne ii since fe - bearing grains are not significantly piled up in the shell of snrs for the mixed case of sne ii and both cases of pisne .",
    "table 1 shows that metallicity of the gas in the shell is in the range from 10@xmath54 to 10@xmath125 @xmath10 , which satisfies the condition to cause the formation of stars with solar mass scales ( schneider et al .",
    "2006a ; tsuribe & omukai 2006 ) .",
    "we can also see that most of calculated [ fe / h ] spans the range from @xmath126 to @xmath127 and are in good agreement with those for hmp and ump stars .",

    "however , more than 100 times excesses of c and o can not be reproduced by any models considered here . for one of the reasons",
    ", we assumed that the metal - rich gas in the ejecta does not mix with the gas in the shell .",
    "hence , we then examine the abundance patterns in the shell by considering that in addition to the piled - up grains , the gas outside the innermost iron layer of the sne is incorporated into the shell until the time of star formation .",
    "the results are shown in figure 6_b_. this case can produce the extreme overabundances of c and o , but leads to unreasonable excesses ( @xmath53 100 times ) of mg and si as well , which is not in agreement with the observations .",
    "it might be possible to reproduce the elemental abundances of hmp stars if the si - mg - rich layer is not mixed with the gas in the shell , although it is necessary to clarify what extent of the gas in the ejecta can be actually incorporated into the shell when population ii.5 stars form .",
    "we also mention here that venkatesan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have proposed that the peculiar abundances of refractory elements in emp stars can be reproduced by the transport of newly formed dust decoupled from the metal - rich gas in primordial sne ii and pisne with @xmath12 10150 @xmath0 .",
    "they considered that the transport of dust is driven by the uv radiation field from the stellar cluster within a snr , which seems to be an impracticable assumption . furthermore , they have not made a detailed comparison between their results and the abundance data of emp stars .",
    "the properties of dust at high redshift have been probed by the dust extinction curves for quasars at @xmath128 ( maiolino et al .",
    "2004a ) . in particular , broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars",
    "are good targets on this matter because they are associated with powerful outflows of dense gas and are significantly reddened by dust .",
    "it has been also known that the extinction properties for low-@xmath11 ( @xmath6 ) bal quasars are well described by the extinction curve in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( reichard et al .  2003 ; richard et al .",
    "2003 ; hopkins et al .  2004 ) .",

    "( 2007 ) also show that the extinction curve for the quasar cfhqs j15091749 at @xmath132 is similar to that for the @xmath5 quasar .",

    ", the extinction curve for the @xmath5 quasars allows us to examine the hypothesis that the formation of dust in the early universe is dominated by sne ii and/or pisne .",
    "maiolino et al .",
    "( 2004b ) have suggested that the extinction curve for the @xmath5 quasar is in excellent agreement with that derived by using sne ii dust models by todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) .",
    "models of dust formed in the unmixed sne ii by nozawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) can also successfully reproduce the extinction curve observed for the quasar at @xmath5 by weighting the progenitor mass with the salpeter imf ( hirashita et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , these studies apply the composition , size distribution , and mass of dust at the time of its formation and do not take into account the modification on the physical properties of dust due to the destruction in snrs .",
    "recently , bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) consider the processing of dust by the reverse shock within snrs and show that the extinction curve by the dust surviving the destruction is still consistent with the extinction curve for the @xmath5 quasar .",
    "here we present the extinction curve expected at the high - redshift universe ( hirashita et al .",
    "2008 ) by using the size distribution and mass abundance of each dust species surviving the destruction in snrs by nozawa et al .",
    "the results of dust evolution within snrs show that small - sized grains are destroyed more efficiently and that the typical size of dust injected from sne to the ism    is biased toward relatively large size ( @xmath41 0.02 @xmath15 m ) . furthermore , for the higher ambient gas density , the efficiency of dust destruction is higher , and the average radius of surviving dust shifts further toward large radius . as a result , the derived extinction curve becomes flatter as the ambient gas density increases , regardless of types of sne and mixing of elements within the he core , as shown in figure 7 .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that at high redshift when sne are the possible sources of dust , the dust extinction curves are very flat .",
    "we also compare our results with the extinction curves for the quasars at @xmath5 ( maiolino et al .",
    "it can be seen that the derived extinction curves can be also allowed by the current observational constraints .",
    "it should be noted here that there are some pieces of evidence supporting the flat extinction curve in high - redshift systems .",
    "two high-@xmath11 bal quasars , sdss j10440125 ( @xmath133 ) and j0756 + 4104 ( @xmath134 ) are detected at submillimeter wavelengths ( priddey et al .",
    "2003 ) , which indicates the presence of dust grains in excess of @xmath33 @xmath0 . however , it is reported that these quasars do not show any reddening in their uv spectra ( maiolino et al .",
    "the absence of reddening and the detection of dust emission seem to be mutually exclusive , but this contradiction can be resolved by the flat extinction curve .",
    "in addition , even at low redshift , the extinction curves of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are suggested to be flat at uv wavelengths and are quite different from those in the diffuse local ism ( maiolino et al .",
    "2001a ; gaskwel et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "this also favors the existence of large grains in the circumnuclear dense region of agns where the coagulation of grains and/or the dominant depletion of small grains by sublimation are expected to take place ( maiolino et al .",
    "however , the extinction curves extracted from sdss quasar samples are similar to that in the smc and do not show flat behavior in the uv . this discrepancy is considered to be due to the systematic difference in the method used in determining extinction laws from composite quasar spectra ( e.g. , willott 2005 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", it has been recognized that the afterglows of grbs are obscured and reddened by dust ( li , a. et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) and are powerful tools to derive the extinction curves in their host galaxies ( e.g. , starling et al .  2007 ; heng et al .",
    "the spectrum of afterglow is given by the power - law formula over the broad range from x - rays to near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "thus , comparing the actually observed spectrum with the power - law spectrum extrapolated from the x - ray bands , we can obtain the intrinsic uv - optical extinction curve . using this method , some studies ( stratta et al .",
    "2005 ; chen et al .",
    "2006 ) have reported the flat properties for the grb extinction curves , almost independent of wavelengths .",
    "li , y. et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also find that the very flat extinction curves are identified in the host galaxies of four grbs with a wide range of redshifts ( @xmath1354 ) .",
    "these facts indicate that the size distribution of dust is biased toward large grains in the environments surrounding the grbs , which can be produced by the coagulational growth of dust in the dense clouds , the evaporation of small grains due to the intense x - ray and uv emission from the grbs , or the preferential destruction of small grains by sn blast waves .",
    "the latter case is consistent with the destruction of newly formed dust in the shocked gas within snrs considered here .",
    "in this paper , we briefly outline recent advances in theoretical studies of the formation and evolution of dust in the early universe , with emphasis on the composition , size distribution , and amount of dust ejected from primordial sne .",
    "the investigations of the evolution of newly formed dust in snrs show that the transport and destruction of dust grains within snrs heavily depend on their initial radii .",
    "small grains are efficiently decelerated by the gas drag and are predominantly destroyed by sputtering in the shocked gas .",
    "a fraction of large grains surviving the destruction are finally trapped in the dense shell behind the forward shock , and the larger grains are injected into the ism without undergoing significant deceleration and erosion .",
    "dust grains surviving the destruction in snrs bring a few important conclusions .",
    "the dust grains accumulated in the dense sn shell can enrich the primordial gas gathered by the forward shock and cause the formation of low - mass population ii.5 stars in the dense shell .",
    "those dust grains can also affect the elemental compositions of the population ii.5 stars and produce the metal abundance patterns resembling those seen in hmp and ump stars .",
    "in addition , the large grains ejected from sne prescribe the extinction property of the ism and lead to a flat extinction curve at the high - redshift universe where dust grains are mainly supplied by primordial sne .",
    "similar situations appear in the circumnuclear regions of agns and the grb host galaxies at low redshifts .",
    "finally , the mass of dust surviving in primordial snrs reaches up to 0.115 @xmath0 , which is consistent with the dust yield per sn required to explain a large quantity of dust observed in high - redshift systems .",
    "thus , sne play the dominant role in the enrichment history of dust as dust factories in the early universe .",
    "recently , cherchneff & lilly ( 2008 ) have suggested that primordial sne are the first molecule providers to the early universe .",
    "they show that the mixing of hydrogen from the progenitor envelope facilitates the formation of molecules in the he core , which acts as a bottleneck process against the formation of dust in the sn ejecta .",
    "however , it has been still debated how large the mixing of elements extends into the ejecta and whether the mixing is at the knotty level or at the atomic level .",
    "we also note that although the mass of dust formed in nearby sne has been considered to be less than @xmath136 @xmath0 , the estimated mass is derived for a limited number of observations by assuming that the ejecta is optically thin ( see kozasa et al .  in this volume , see also sugerman et al .",
    "2006 ; miekle et al .",
    "2007 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in order to reveal the evolution of dust grains in the early universe , we need further investigations of the fundamental processes of formation and destruction of dust expected at high redshift .",
    "elvis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have proposed the possible condensation of a large amount of dust in quasar winds , while it is suggested that the formation of dust in agb stars can dominate over the contributions from sne even at @xmath2 ( valiante , r. et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "hence , the formation of dust and its survival in these possible formation sites in the early universe should be examined .",
    "in addition , modellings of the spectral energy distribution of high-@xmath11 galaxies ( e.g. , takeuchi & ishii 2004 ) as well as nearby young blue compact dwarfs ( e.g. , takeuchi et al .  2003 , 2005 ; galliano et al .",
    "2005 ) are crucial to specify the properties of dust in the primeval universe .",
