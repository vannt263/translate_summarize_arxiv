    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) of massive galaxies has been the focus of much attention recently , triggered by findings that suggest a non - universal and systematically varying form of the imf among galaxies in the current day universe @xcite .",
    "these findings differ from studies of resolved stellar systems in and near the milky way , which indicate that the imf has a universal form @xcite .",
    "strong evidence for a non - universal imf has come from the application of various independent techniques , including gravitational lensing @xcite , stellar dynamical modelling @xcite , and spectral synthesis @xcite . with few exceptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such studies so far agree that , in general , galaxies with higher velocity dispersion require a ` heavy ' form of the imf in order to account fully for the measured total mass - to - light ratio . while this general picture is one of qualitative agreement , there is ongoing debate as to what key parameters drive the imf variations . in particular , @xcite find a notable discrepancy between methods on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis , and conclude that the dynamically - derived imf normalisation for 34 objects in atlas3d does not correlate with [ mg / fe ] after controlling for velocity dispersion .    in this letter",
    ", we report on how the stellar population properties of the complete atlas@xmath0 sample are related to the dynamically - derived imf normalisation .",
    "this expands the sample of 34 objects of @xcite to a total of 212 galaxies , studying age , metallicity and [ @xmath2/fe ] , and spanning a significantly larger range of stellar population parameter values .",
    "all observations come from the atlas@xmath0 survey @xcite , and comprise optical integral - field spectroscopy covering half the stellar light , on average ( i.e. one effective radius , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the spectral data cubes were spatially integrated to form an effective aperture corresponding to a radius of one eighth of an effective radius , @xmath6 .",
    "such an aperture is similar to those used in other ( generally long - slit or single - fibre spectrograph ) studies in the literature , and allows our results to be more directly compared to them .",
    "the single stellar population ( ssp ) models of @xcite were used to measure the ssp - equivalent age , metallicity [ z / h ] , and alpha - element abundance [ @xmath2/fe ] ( with imf fixed to that of a unimodal power law of the form : @xmath7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the chi - squared approach detailed in @xcite , finding the model from an interpolated grid which simultaneously best approximates our measured h@xmath8 , fe5015 and mg@xmath9 line indices on the lick / ids system @xcite . a full presentation of the stellar populations for the atlas@xmath0 survey is given in mcdermid et al .",
    "( _ in prep_. ) .",
    "stellar kinematics were measured from our integral - field spectroscopy using the pixel fitting code ppxf @xcite , and the resulting maps of stellar line - of - sight mean velocity and velocity dispersion were fitted using general anisotropic jeans models @xcite , in conjunction with multi - gaussian mass models @xcite from sdss imaging , which are reported in @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratios @xmath10 we use here were derived accounting for a standard dark matter halo @xcite , and correspond to models ` b ' as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the same integral - field spectroscopy was used to measure the spectroscopic stellar mass - to - light ratio ( assuming a salpeter imf ) , @xmath11 .",
    "these were measured independently from the ssp parameters ( which also assume a salpeter imf ) , using a regularised ppxf spectral fit of the miuscat stellar population models from @xcite as templates . to be consistent with the stellar kinematics used in the dynamical modelling , the spectra within an aperture extending to one effective radius were summed and used in the spectral fit . in all",
    ", 264 templates were simultaneously fitted to this aperture spectrum , giving the mass - weighted mean mass - to - light ratio for each galaxy taking into account a smooth , non - parametric star - formation history .",
    "the resulting r - band @xmath10 and @xmath11 values are given in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "using the same nomenclature as @xcite , we quantify the mass normalisation of the imf using the imf parameter @xmath1 , such that @xmath12 implies an imf ` heavier ' than salpeter . for the results that follow ,",
    "we apply the same sample selection as that paper , excluding objects with h@xmath13  within an effective radius , on the basis that they exhibit very strong age gradients , thus breaking the constant mass - to - light ratio assumption of the dynamical modelling approach , and making @xmath11 ill - defined . in addition",
    ", we exclude the object pgc071531 , as the kinematic data were of too poor quality to allow a secure measure of @xmath3 .",
    "the following analysis uses the remaining 212 galaxies satisfying these criteria .",
    "we begin by showing the link between the imf mass normalisation ( via @xmath3 ) to simple empirical quantities to make our results independent of stellar population models . fig .",
    "[ fig : index_imf ] presents the distribution of the imf parameter plotted in the two - dimensional plane of line strength indices h@xmath8 and @xmath14mgfe50@xmath15^\\prime$ ] .",
    "the former index is sensitive to stellar age ; the latter to metallicity in a way that is not strongly dependent on [ @xmath2/fe ]  @xcite .",
    "the values of the imf parameter in this plane have been adaptively smoothed using the two - dimensional locally weighted regression robust technique ( dubbed loess ) of @xcite , as implemented in @xcite .",
    "the loess - smoothed distribution tries to remove observational errors and intrinsic scatter to estimate the mean values of the underlying galaxy population , thus approximating the mean values one would obtain from simple binning of much larger samples .",
    "overplotted on these points is a grid of ssp parameter predictions from @xcite for a super - solar [ @xmath2/fe]@xmath16 .",
    "there is a trend of larger values of the imf parameter ( corresponding to ` heavier ' imfs ) towards older , metal - rich objects .",
    "the trend , however , is not monotonic , with lower metallicity objects also showing relatively high imf parameter values , on average .    the loess technique averages co - spatial data points , and as with any binning / averaging approach , the absolute range of values is reduced compared to the original data , via reduction of intrinsic and measurement scatter ( e.g. compare the colour scale of fig.1 with the intrinsic imf values implied in fig.2 ) .",
    "the loess - averaged colour - map plots are useful to uncover the underlying trends , but to quantitatively treat correlations of the actual values , in the following section we analyse the two - dimensional projections of imf with stellar population parameters individually .",
    "each panel in fig.[fig : ml_imf ] presents our two mass - to - light ratios @xmath10 and @xmath11 plotted against each other , overplotted with diagonal identity lines to indicate the corresponding imf normalisation , such that the imf varies perpendicular to these diagonal lines .",
    "the thick black line shows the result of a one - dimensional locally - weighted regression ( loess ) analysis , in order to trace the central ridge - line of the mass - to - light ratio points .",
    "the measured ssp parameters are indicated by coloured points , with the parameter name given in the plot title .",
    "again , the ssp parameter values have been smoothed using the two - dimensional loess algorithm used in section [ sec : ls ] in order to show the average trend expected from a larger sample of galaxies .",
    "these plots are directly comparable to fig .",
    "11 of @xcite , where the colour scale was used to show how velocity dispersion varies in this plane .",
    "it can be seen that the general trends agree with what was inferred above , namely that the imf becomes systematically ` heavier ' , _ on average _",
    ", for galaxies that are older , more metal rich , and additionally , more enhanced in alpha elements .",
    "it is clear from these plots , however , that stellar population is _ not _ a good predictor of @xmath3 .",
    "the _ average _ trend appears due to the fact that , while older , or alpha - enhanced , galaxies span a larger range of @xmath3 values going from kroupa to heavier than salpeter , the range of @xmath3 appears largely limited to kroupa - like values for galaxies with young ages and low [ @xmath2/fe ] .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn from fig .",
    "11 of @xcite , where galaxies with low velocity dispersion are similarly limited to kroupa - like imf normalisation .",
    "metallicity shows a broadly similar trend , however the detailed distribution is different from that with age and [ @xmath2/fe ] , with the iso - metallicity bands running more parallel to the imf normalisation .",
    "notably , there are objects with low metallicity that require an imf heavier than salpeter , as in fig.[fig : index_imf ] .",
    "we note that the population parameters vary more tightly with @xmath11 than @xmath10 , reflecting the strong dependence of stellar population m / l estimates on stellar population parameters .",
    "the dynamical m / l estimate is independent of stellar evolutionary effects , which may explain the broader range of population parameters at fixed @xmath10 .    in fig.[fig :",
    "imf_pop_2d ] we present the two - dimensional relations of the imf parameter and population parameters , where points represent our individual measurements .",
    "a robust linear fit of the form @xmath17 is made in each panel using the lts_linefit routine described in @xcite , which combines the least trimmed squares robust technique of @xcite into a least - squares fitting algorithm which allows for intrinsic scatter .",
    "fit parameters are given on the upper - left of each panel .",
    "our relations have around 25% scatter due to observational errors , with 12% intrinsic scatter .",
    "the spearman s rank correlation coefficient ( r ) and the two - sided significance of its deviation from zero ( @xmath18 , with smaller values implying higher significance ) are given on the upper right .",
    "the correlation coefficient values , which are independent from the assumption of a linear relationship , confirm the presence of weak but statistically significant relationships of @xmath3 with age and [ @xmath2/fe ] , and no evidence of a correlation with total metallicity .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the trends between the dynamically - derived imf normalisation parameter @xmath3 and stellar population parameters are weak .",
    "we find that old or alpha - enhanced galaxies have _ on average _ heavier imf normalisation , but a heavy imf is not only found in those galaxies . old ( and high [ @xmath2/fe ] ) galaxies span a large range of imf normalisation going from kroupa to salpeter , while young ( and low [ @xmath2/fe ] ) ones seems to almost exclusively have a kroupa normalisation .",
    "metallicity shows a less clear distinction , having a broad range of mass normalisations at all metallicity values ( fig .",
    "3 , middle panel ) . @xcite also find a weaker relationship between imf and total metallicity , [ z / h ] , concluding , as here , that there is no compelling evidence of a correlation .",
    "we have explored several avenues to verify the weak trends we find .",
    "for example , we find fully consistent results using the mass - weighted age and metallicities from the spectral fits used to derive our @xmath11 instead of the ssp values , showing that the different models ( schiavon ssp models versus vazdekis model spectra ) and methods ( chi - squared fitting for the best ssp versus ppxf spectral fitting of star formation histories for the mass - weighted values ) yield consistent results . using the spectrum integrated within a full effective radius @xmath5 to derive the ssp parameters ( instead of @xmath6 ) gives trends equivalent to fig.[fig : imf_pop_2d ] within the 1@xmath19 uncertainties , with comparable scatter , correlation coefficient values and significance ( using this larger aperture , the spearman ( r , p ) values become @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the equivalent relations of imf with age , metallicity and [ @xmath2/fe ] respectively ) .",
    "this reassures us that our choice of aperture is not important , and that possible radial variations in the imf @xcite do not directly affect our conclusions .",
    "it is well established that stellar population parameters correlate positively with velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "given the positive correlation between velocity dispersion and imf presented in @xcite , it is tempting to conclude that the trends shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imf_pop_2d ] are simply tracing this underlying trend of imf with velocity dispersion , as argued in @xcite .",
    "however , the tightest correlation of our stellar population parameters with velocity dispersion is with total metallicity ( mcdermid et al . in prep . ) .",
    "conversely , metallicity shows _ no _ evidence for any direct , linear correlation with the imf . this contrary trend of imf with metallicity compared with age and [ @xmath2/fe ] suggests that our findings are not purely a result of the underlying correlation of imf with velocity dispersion , as this would give rise to consistent behaviour between all three stellar population parameters , which _ all _ positively correlate with velocity dispersion .",
    "the weak trends we find here are consistent with the similarly weak trend between @xmath3 and velocity dispersion ( @xmath23 ) , reported in @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the atlas@xmath0 velocity dispersion - imf relation with several published spectral studies @xcite is given in fig.12 of @xcite . while there is overlap between the various spectral studies and atlas@xmath0 over the range of velocity dispersion in common ( @xmath24kms@xmath25 ) ,",
    "the overall relationship for the entire sample is significantly more shallow than that suggested by the spectral studies . restricting our sample to galaxies with this range of velocity dispersion ( where the agreement is best ) results in _ shallower _ gradients in the @xmath3 - ssp relations presented here , with larger uncertainties ( a zero gradient with age and [ @xmath2/fe ] is excluded with only 2@xmath19 confidence rather than 5@xmath19 ) , and smaller correlation coefficients ( r@xmath26 ) with less significance ( p@xmath27 ) , consistent with no significant correlation of @xmath3 with any population parameter .",
    "other explanations for the weak trends are possible biases in the dynamical and/or population imf estimates .",
    "an obvious potential systematic problem with the dynamically derived imf , which has often been invoked in the past , is the treatment of the dark matter content in the dynamical models .",
    "we showed in @xcite that for dark matter to explain the imf trends , it would have to follow the stellar distribution much closer than any current model predicts , making this explanation very unlikely .",
    "other sources of biases include general problems in the @xmath11 derived from stellar population models .",
    "using the ssp models of @xcite and @xcite to derive @xmath11 from our line - strengths , we find that the weak age trend is removed due to the biased reduction in @xmath11 by young populations when using the ( luminosity - weighted ) ssp approach instead of ( mass - weighted ) spectral fitting . any relationship with [ z / h ] remains absent using this ssp approach , and the weak trend with [ @xmath2/fe ] , though present , becomes less significant , with best - fit gradients excluding zero at only a 1 - 4@xmath19 level .",
    "our weak trends are therefore a general outcome from different models and approaches .",
    "finally , we note that a direct comparison of the imf parameters for galaxies in common between our study and @xcite yields only a weak relationship between the two studies @xcite . the relatively small overlapping sample ( 34 objects ) , and differences in spatial apertures used in determining the imf normalisation ( their small central aperture versus our imf analysis using data from , on average , one effective radius ) preclude firm conclusions on how this lack of agreement relates to the systematic uncertainties of either study . removing these remaining issues",
    "is the focus of future work .",
    "we present the observed trends of stellar population parameters with the dynamically determined imf for 212 early - type galaxies from the atlas@xmath0 survey . using adaptive smoothing to highlight the average trends comparable to studies of larger samples , we find that the imf normalisation tends _ on average _ to be ` heavy ' for both weak h@xmath8 _ and/or _ weak metal absorption line strengths . using single stellar population models ,",
    "we show that the stellar population properties of age , metallicity and [ @xmath2/fe ] span a broad range of values for any given imf normalisation .",
    "we present the observed relations of imf with the ssp properties of the individual galaxies of our sample .",
    "we find notably weak relations between the imf and all three stellar population parameters , with mildly positive correlations of imf ` heaviness ' with age and [ @xmath2/fe ] , and _ no _ significant correlation with total metallicity .",
    "taken together with the weak relation between the imf normalisation and velocity dispersion already presented in @xcite , these results are somewhat at variance with those from various recent spectroscopic studies .",
    "future efforts for obtaining large samples of individual objects with integral - field spectroscopy that also provides imf - sensitive spectral features are now critical to permit the responsible systematic uncertainties in local galaxy imf studies to be resolved .",
