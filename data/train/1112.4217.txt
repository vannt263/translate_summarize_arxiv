    "a measurement of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) determines the integrated emission of all photon sources since the early universe . at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths , the dominant physical process thought to be responsible for the generation of photons is nucleosynthesis in stars and gravitational energy released in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . as",
    "most stars reside in galaxies , the brightness of the extragalactic cosmic nir background ( cnirb ) may be constrained by integrating the light resolved into discrete sources along a line of sight through the cosmos ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , since unresolved or faint sources of emission may also contribute to the cnirb , such source counts are necessarily lower limits to the total emission .",
    "the most complete way to determine the total cnirb brightness is direct absolute photometry measurements using suitably designed instruments , and the difference between absolute photometry measurements and source counts could reveal a diffuse background from the epoch of reionization .",
    "because atmospheric emission at nir is 100 times more than the total sky brightness , space - borne observations are required for absolute photometry .",
    "measurements from the diffuse infrared background explorer ( dirbe ) on the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) @xcite and the near - infrared spectrometer ( nirs ) on the infrared telescope in space ( irts ) @xcite indicate that the total cnirb brightness significantly exceeds the brightness determined from deep galaxy number counts @xcite after subtraction of the zodiacal light ( zl ) from sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust grains .",
    "for example , the best galaxy counts give @xmath3 nw / m@xmath4/sr  at j - band ( @xmath5 m ) @xcite while dirbe measured @xmath6 nw / m@xmath4/sr  at j - band @xcite and irts measured @xmath7 nw / m@xmath4/sr  at @xmath8 m @xcite with the dirbe zl model @xcite . the cnirb derived from absolute photometry measurements depend critically on the choice of zl model , and the `` strong no - zodi '' foreground dust model @xcite produces significantly lower ebl results , @xmath9 nw / m@xmath4/sr  at @xmath5 m @xcite .",
    "an excess was also measured in optical bands with a combined hubble space telescope ( hst ) and ground - based measurement @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that their resulting ebl values should be corrected upwards and , because of large systematic errors , should be understood as upper limits only .",
    "this was confirmed by @xcite whose reanalysis gave a formal new ebl value of @xmath10 nw / m@xmath4/sr  at 0.8 @xmath0 m .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is unclear ; possibilities range from the prosaic , for example residual zl @xcite , to the profound , such as lyman-@xmath11 emission from the first stars @xcite .    on the other hand , a recent re - analysis of pioneer 10/11 data from outside of the zodiacal",
    "cloud gives @xmath12 nw / m@xmath4/sr  at 0.44 @xmath0 m and @xmath13 nw / m@xmath4/sr  at 0.64 @xmath0 m @xcite , and a recent result from the dark cloud shadow method gives @xmath14 nw / m@xmath4/sr  at 0.40 @xmath0 m and @xmath15 nw / m@xmath4/sr  at 0.52 @xmath0 m @xcite , which are more consistent with the source counts at optical wavelengths .",
    "in addition , indirect measurements of the cnirb from tev - energy @xmath16-ray attenuation via pair production are consistent with the source counts @xcite , and these results dispute the theory that a significant fraction of cnirb comes from ebl . in these analysis , the authors calculated attenuation spectra of the blazars in various cnirb levels by assuming their intrinsic spectra as @xmath17 , and compared with observed spectra .",
    "the general result is that a cnirb of @xmath18 nw / m@xmath4/sr  requires @xmath19 , which is not consistent with estimates of intrinsic blazar spectra either from theory or from observations of nearby blazars @xcite .",
    "these are all viable methods of constraining the brightness of the cnirb and thus the amplitude of the cnirb and its origin are controversial . however , there is no substitute for direct photometry if the instrumental and astrophysical systematic effects can be mitigated with improved knowledge of local foregrounds .",
    "spectroscopy at wavelengths 1 @xmath0 m to 2 @xmath0 m is especially important because the cnirb from reionization is predicted to peak near 1 @xmath0 m and fall in brightness at shorter wavelengths .",
    "it is clear that our knowledge of the nir ebl must improve in order to better constrain the universe s total emission and thereby models of structure formation and galaxy evolution .",
    "in addition to the ebl science , low resolution absolute spectroscopic measurements of the background from above the earth s atmosphere allow determinations of the zl and the diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) from starlight scattered by interstellar dust grains , neither of which are well measured near @xmath20 m .",
    "both of these sources of emission are truly diffuse in nature and are astrophysically interesting in their own right .",
    "for example , since the zodiacal cloud is the nearest analog to extrasolar dust clouds and debris disks , understanding the local zodiacal dust environment allows inferences to be made about the nature of distant systems .",
    "the low resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) on the cosmic infrared background experiment ( ciber ) @xcite is specifically designed to perform absolute spectrophotometric measurement at nir wavelength ( 0.75 @xmath0 m @xmath2 2.1 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the lrs has a field of view ( fov ) @xmath21 along a slit and spectral resolution @xmath2215 - 30 .",
    "the lrs has successfully flown on ciber twice , and has yielded good results from both flights : for example , the lrs previously detected an unknown silicate feature in the zl @xcite .",

    "we present the lrs instrument in detail , concentrating on its optical , mechanical and electrical characteristics . in section [",
    "s : instrument ] we review the physical properties of the lrs , and in section [ s : lab ] the laboratory testing and characterization of the lrs is presented .",

    "0.5 cm    ciber is a rocket - borne instrument designed to search for fluctuations in the nir extragalactic background from the first galaxies , perform direct spectrophotometric measurements of the cnirb , and measure the absolute brightness of the zl cloud using a fraunhofer line measurement .",

    "ciber comprises four optical instruments to achieve its science goals : two wide - field imagers @xcite , a narrow band spectrometer ( nbs ; @xcite ) , and the lrs .",
    "these instruments are mounted to a common optical bench which is cryogenically cooled using an onboard reservoir of liquid nitrogen to reduce in - band thermal emission below the detector sensitivity .",
    "for ciber s first flight , a terrier - black brant ix rocket @xcite carrying the ciber payload successfully launched from white sands missile range ( wsmr ) on 2009 february 25 achieving an apogee of @xmath23330 km and providing 420 seconds of astronomical data .",
    "ciber s second flight took place at wsmr on 2010 july 10 , incorporating several improvements to the instruments , and also provided 420 seconds of astronomical data .",
    "the instrument package was successfully recovered for future flights in both cases , and two additional flights of essentially the same configuration are planned .    here",
    "we briefly review the other two ciber instruments , which observe simultaneously with the lrs .",
    "the two - color wide - field imagers are designed to measure fluctuations in the cnirb .",
    "both telescopes have a @xmath24 fov which allows measurement of the spatial power spectrum on scales at and beyond the predicted reionization peak at 10 arcminutes @xcite .",

    "as shown in table  [ lrsspec ] , the lrs is a refractive imaging spectrometer with a 5-cm aperture designed and fabricated by the genesia corporation in japan .",
    "the most demanding requirements on the lrs design are driven by the nature of absolute photometric measurement of faint , diffuse radiation over a wide wavelength range .",
    "the sensitivity and wavelength requirements lead to a multi - slit spectrometer with a large fov ( @xmath21 ) and a large pixel pitch ( @xmath35 m ) to maximize the throughput of the system . to maximize the number of independent pixels available to measure surface brightness , the size of the point spread function ( psf ) was designed to be @xmath36 pixel over the whole array .",
    "this design was verified by focus testing ( for a discussion of the latter see section [ sss : focus ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the lrs is designed to be cryogenically cycled to @xmath37k many times and tolerate both the launch acceleration and vibration , and the space environment experienced by sounding rocket payloads .",
    "these requirements lead to a simple , rugged , but precisely optimized mechanical design .",
    "additionally , the lrs instrument includes a cold shutter assembly to monitor the detector dark current for absolute spectroscopy , and a calibration lamp to confirm the stability of the system during the flight .",
    "these components are basically common for all four of the ciber instruments , and a light emitting diode l10660 peaking at @xmath38 nm by hamamatsu photonics is chosen as the calibration lamp for the lrs to closely match the mean wavelength .",
    "details of their design and implementation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the design of the lrs optical elements is based on cryogenic measurements of the refractive indices of optical materials from @xcite . as shown in figure  [ lrs ] , the lrs optics form an initial focus at a field stop , where a mask with five equally spaced slits is placed . this slit width is @xmath39 m , equivalent to two pixels on the detector .",
    "the central slit has a small notch whose size on the detector is 6 pixels by 15 pixels located at the bottom center to facilitate laboratory testing .",
    "the optics then relay this field stop back to a collimated beam where a prism disperses incident light perpendicular to the slit mask direction with a spectral resolution of @xmath40 depending on wavelength ( see section [ sss : pixeltolambda ] ) .",
    "finally , this parallel beam is refocused on a @xmath41 substrate - removed hgcdte picnic detector array fabricated by teledyne technologies inc .. the slit mask is imaged to five separate 2.8 arcminute @xmath29 5.5 degree strips on the sky at the focal plane .",
    "the edges of the array are not illuminated by the optics and can be used as a monitor of diffuse stray light falling on the detector .",
    "the spectral response of the lrs is restricted to 0.75 @xmath0 m @xmath2 2.1 @xmath0 m by two blocking filters in front of the optics ( the effective spectral range is shown in figure  [ filter ] ) .",
    "in order to detect the peak of the cnirb , the sensitivity goal of the lrs is 10 nw / m@xmath4/sr  in a 25 s integration time .",
    "]      the lrs focal plane array electronics chain is the same as that of the other three ciber arrays described in @xcite .",
    "here we simply note that the ciber electronics , which have a common architecture for all four instruments , generate the clocking signals for the picnic multiplexer , perform the array readout and digitization , and are responsible for various housekeeping tasks .",
    "the digitized array readouts are passed from the ciber electronics to the nasa - provided payload telemetry module for transmission to ground stations .",
    "an important feature of the infrared arrays is the ability to perform a non - destructive read - out in which the charge on the detector photo - diode junction is not altered by sampling its value .",
    "the focal plane infrared arrays on ciber optics are controlled by a sequence of reset and read - out pulses using the method presented in @xcite . the picnic array on lrs is separated into four quadrants , and all four quadrants are operated in the same method independently .",
    "the array is read out at @xmath234 hz and then a reset signal is applied after some number of frames @xcite . since electrical carriers generated by photons are integrated until the reset , an astrophysical image is obtained by calculating the best fit slope to each pixel within a reset interval ( `` sampling - up - the - ramp '' technique , @xcite ) .",
    "thermally activated carriers give rise to a continuous stream of electrons in the absence of light and generate a dark current in hgcdte detectors . because of this , dark current subtraction is essential for absolute photometry . in flight ,",
    "the lrs dark current was monitored by taking dark frames with the cold shutter .",
    "the temperature of the ciber focal plane assemblies was controlled to within @xmath42k / s stability to prevent dark current caused by thermal drift ( see @xcite for more detail ) .",

    ", we evaluate several dark frames taken while the cold shutter in front of the detector is closed . in this shutter",

    ", the detector is illuminated by thermal emission from the laboratory .",
    "the resulting image has high dynamic range ; pixels at longer wavelengths ( @xmath46 m ) are saturated from thermal radiation , whereas pixels at the edges of the array are not illuminated by the optics and essentially give dark current .",
    "the first three or four samples following a reset do not follow a linear model because of the reset anomaly , which gives a large intensity ramp at the leading edge of each quadrant where the readout electronics is located .",
    "therefore the linear fit excludes the first four samples .",
    "figure  [ saturation ] ( a ) shows an example of the behavior of a typical pixel with a saturated photo current . @xcite introduce a functional form to describe non - linearity , the resulting fit is also shown in figure  [ saturation ] ( a ) .",
    "the typical maximum electron capacity is @xmath47e@xmath44  and pixel values deviate from the linearity from around @xmath48e@xmath44  over the array .",
    "for example , for a typical @xmath49s flight integration a source brighter than @xmath50e@xmath43s  ( corresponding to 7 mag at 1 @xmath0 m ) would begin to cause non - linearities in the detector .",
    "this threshold is significantly larger than the estimated lrs diffuse sky brightness signal of @xmath51e@xmath43s .",
    "the brightness of sources which induce currents larger than @xmath50e@xmath43s  can be derived by fitting to subsets where the signal depth is @xmath52e@xmath44 .",
    "for example , the brightest star detected with the lrs during the first ciber flight ( 42dra , a mag@xmath53=2.9 , k1.5iii star ) has a photocurrent of @xmath54e@xmath43s ; its spectrum was derived using data from only the first three seconds of integration @xcite .    though the detector well begins to saturate @xmath55e@xmath44 ,",
    "the detector is not perfectly linear even for well depths @xmath56e@xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ saturation ] ( b ) shows the correction factor for the linearity as a function of the integrated signal normalized at 100 e@xmath44 .",
    "systematic separation lying low from the linearity might be caused by another reset anomaly , but this effect is small enough to neglect because the 1% difference in the first several points will be reduced by a factor of 100 by fitting to the whole data set . as described in section [ ss : calibration ] , since the lrs absolute calibration was done with an integrated signal of @xmath57e@xmath44and the lrs diffuse integrated sky brightness is @xmath23 2000 e@xmath44 , 1.5% linearity correction is required .      0.4 cm    picnic arrays can suffer from image persistence , a subtle increase in dark current in response to prior illumination .",
    "this image persistence varies significantly from detector to detector .",
    "we studied this effect with the flight picnic detector .",
    "the picnic detector was illuminated by the calibration lamp , and then the shutter was closed and dark images were taken .",
    "the first several dark frames have the image persistence from the calibration lamp , and the image persistence in the resulting dark images was studied as a function of time and the number of reset signals .",
    "the dark images were made from 12 , 25 , and 50 raw frames which is equivalent to 3 , 6 , and @xmath58s integrations , respectively .",
    "figure  [ memoryeffect ] shows the image persistence at pixels where the average signal from the calibration lamp was 640 e@xmath43s . as figure  [ memoryeffect ] shows , the image persistence after the first reset signal was @xmath59% of the original value , and reduces to the dark current level inversely with time .",
    "this behavior is similar in all pixels over the array .",
    "although there are widespread misconceptions that the image persistence can be also reduced by multiple resets , we found multiple reset signals , except the first reset , were not effective in reducing persistence .",
    "@xcite introduced a qualitative model of the image persistence of the hgcdte detector array .",
    "since the intervals between the fields during the ciber flight was typically 15 seconds , the image persistence is visible in flight data when very bright stars are detected , and the persistent signals were about 0.2% of the original signals .",
    "we can mask detected persistent stars in such cases .",
    "hgcdte detector array readouts typically suffer from some level of electrical cross talk ; indeed , we have observed cross - talk in the lrs electronic chain .",
    "a test was conducted to investigate the effects of the electrical cross - talk . in this test ,",
    "the upper two quadrants of the detector array were masked and then the detector was illuminated by strong thermal emission from the laboratory and data was acquired .",
    "the cross - talk signals ( labeled `` g '' in figure [ crosstalk ] ) appeared even in the masked quadrants at identical positions of the incident thermal signals ( labeled `` s '' in figure [ crosstalk ] ) .",
    "this measurement showed that 0.35 % of the incident signal on a quadrant is injected into the other quadrants .",
    "although this fraction is significantly below the noise level under normal flight conditions , the uncertainty in its correction imposed an irreducible systematic error on the cnirb measurement from the first flight data set because of the large thermal stray light ( this is discussed in section [ sss : baffle ] ) .    ]",
    "-0.5 cm    0.4 cm        in order to maximize the number of independent pixels available for the measurement of surface brightness , the detector array must be at the best focus position of the instrument optics during flight . because it is not possible to measure the positions of the optical components in the lrs to sufficient accuracy to calculate the position of the lrs s focal plane a priori ,",
    "the position of the focal plane must be determined experimentally . to verify the focus of the instrument and measure the imaging quality at the best focal position",
    ", we carried out a campaign of laboratory measurements .",
    "for these tests , a high - resolution monochromator system ms257 manufactured by newport is used as a light source with a narrow spectral band ( see @xcite for detail ) .",
    "the wavelength resolution of the monochromator is 15 nm in this test , so that spreading in the lrs dispersion direction is negligible .",
    "the incoming beam from the source is passed through a pinhole at the prime focus of a collimating telescope with a focal length @xmath60 mm made by parks optical inc .. the focus of the collimating telescope is determined by an auto - collimation procedure using a collimating microscope and flat mirror placed at the aperture of the collimator ( see @xcite for detail ) . once in focus ,",
    "the beam from the collimating telescope is fed to the aperture of the lrs optics .    as the slit mask blocks most of the optical paths from the lrs aperture to the detector array , the beam of the collimating telescope must be steered to fall on the notch in the slit mask . the image formed on",
    "the array is a measurement of the psf in response to a point source .",
    "as the detector is mechanically fixed in the instrument , the best focus is determined by moving the pinhole along the optical axis of the collimating telescope . given the focal lengths of the lrs @xmath61 and collimating telescope @xmath62 ,",
    "the relation between shifts along the optical axis at the position of the pinhole @xmath63 from best focus and the equivalent shift at the detector @xmath64 can be calculated by : @xmath65    as the focal plane assembly is statically mounted on the instrument , moving the detector array to the best focus of the instrument requires opening the experiment and physically shimming the focal plane assembly by @xmath66 .",
    "the experiment is then cooled and the test performed again . due to the vagaries of the mechanical contraction of the various components under cryogenic cycling ,",
    "the position of the detector array may not fall at the intended position .",
    "the focus position is therefore determined iteratively by testing , warming the experiment and shimming the focal plane assembly , cooling , and testing again .",
    "after several such iterations , the detector position repeatably falls at the best focus of the instrument .",
    "figure  [ focus ] shows the best focus performance of the lrs in the configuration flown during the first ciber flight .",
    "the misalignment between spatial and dispersion directions in figure  [ focus ] was caused by undersampling .",
    "measurements of a pixel - scale spot size suffered from a large systematic error , depending on where the centroid of the stop is locating in a pixel .",
    "however , it clearly shows that the detector was positioned close to the optimal focus where the psf size was @xmath231 pixel , showing that the imaging quality of lrs at the flight focus position matches the design .",
    "the focal depth of lrs is @xmath2380 @xmath0 m ( pixel size : 40 @xmath0 m at @xmath67 ) .",

    "unfortunately , an accurate measurement of the fluxes of individual sources in flight is made difficult by the slit mask , which requires precise knowledge of the psf and pointing for use in calibration .",

    "two calibration measurements are performed using different light sources : a tunable laser ( sircus ; @xcite ) and a quartz - tungsten - halogen lamp .",
    "the traveling sircus lasers brought to calibrate ciber consist of a ti : sapphire laser tunable from 700 nm to 1000 nm , and an optical parametric oscillator , fed by the ti : sapphire laser , which was used to cover the range from 1000 nm to 2100 nm . a quartz - tungsten - halogen lamp manufactured by schott",
    "is used for the white light calibrations .",
    "a comparison of the monochromatic and white light measurements is an independent check that the calibration is correct and that there are no low - level broad - band light leaks . in either case , the light source is coupled to a 48-inch barium sulfate integrating sphere , the output port of which is viewed by the lrs . the transfer standard detectors are different for the two sets of measurements .",
    "nist broad - band radiance meters calibrated at sircus were used for the laser measurements , and the nist remote sensing laboratory s analytical spectral devices ( asd ) fieldspec3 spectroradiometer was used for the white light measurements .",
    "these measurements are used to accurately calibrate both the absolute and relative ( i.e. pixel - to - pixel ) responsivity of the lrs .",
    "a more detailed explanation of the ciber calibration apparatus can be found in @xcite .",
    "the large mismatch in sensitivity of the lrs instrumentation compared to the nist radiometers requires a scheme to attenuate the calibrated surface brightness to a level that does not saturate the lrs .",
    "the radiance levels observed by the lrs must be @xmath83 to @xmath84 fainter than that needed to make accurate measurements with the reference radiometers .",
    "the intensity levels for the lrs were reduced by passing light from the source through a cascade of one or more smaller integrating spheres ( 2 inches to 6 inches in diameter ) in series with the large sphere , and using a monitor on one of the cascaded spheres to precisely measure each attenuation factor .",
    "a series of separate measurements at higher intensity levels were used to establish the ratio between the monitor and the radiance of the large sphere .",
    "this involved measuring the ratios of the radiance or monitor signal between each sphere and the next in the cascade .",
    "the flux levels were adjusted , as needed for adequate signal - to - noise ratios , over a very large dynamic range either by bypassing an integrating sphere in the cascade , adjusting the coupling between the light source and the optical fiber feeding an integrating sphere , or using a combination of half - wave - plate and a beam splitter for laser measurements .",
    "the broad - band radiometers used to make laser measurements were calibrated at nist using a laser - fed integrating sphere source and a detector calibrated to measure optical power .",
    "the radiance levels of the source were deduced given a knowledge of the dimensions of apertures on both the source and detector and the distance between them .",
    "the responsivity of the radiometers varies smoothly as a function of wavelength allowing us to interpolate to the higher resolutions used during the ciber measurements . with the exception of one radiometer , which has a lens ,",
    "all were simple gershun - tube designs , and all utilized single - element solid state detectors made of either ingaas , si or ge . the asd used for the white - light measurements was calibrated at nist using an integrating - sphere source of known radiance that is traceable to fixed - point blackbodies .    at each laser wavelength during the lrs measurements ,",
    "the monitor signal was recorded with the laser on and then off ( shuttered ) .",
    "the shutter intercepts the beam before it enters the fiber in order to measure the dark signals , and it is opened and closed by a trigger signal synchronized with the lrs integration .",
    "a similar procedure was used when the lrs viewed the white light source .",
    "resets and periodic background measurements , made by blocking the lamp or turning it off , were performed manually .      0.5 cm     % uncertainty .",
    "[ responsivity ] ]    -0.3 cm    0.4 cm     detection limit of the lrs for 25 second estimated from the noise level ( read out noise + photon noise ) in the flight data .",
    "the sensitivity reaches @xmath85 nw / m@xmath4/sr  which meets the requirement of lrs.[limit ] ]    -0.3 cm    0.4 cm    the calibration from the white light measurements is straightforward .",
    "the asd provides the absolutely calibrated spectrum @xmath86 of the integrating sphere in nw / m@xmath4/sr / nm ; the lrs simply observes the source simultaneously and obtains the equivalent signal @xmath87 in e@xmath43s .",
    "the conversion factor @xmath88 from e@xmath43s  to nw / m@xmath4/sr / nm at pixel position @xmath89 can be calculated by computing the ratio of these data ; @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the transmittance spectrum of the test window ( a bk7 parallel plate with 20 mm thickness ) of the ciber cryostat which was measured separately , showing @xmath92 across the lrs free spectral range .",
    "the pixel position @xmath89 is related to wavelength @xmath93 by the wavelength map shown in the right hand panel of figure  [ spectral ] .",
    "because the wavelength resolution of the lrs and reference asd detector are different , the asd measurements are smoothed to match the wavelength resolution of the lrs .",
    "these smoothed spectra yield the white light calibration factor for the lrs .",
    "a map of the pixel sensitivity , normalized to the mean over the array at each wavelength , is shown in figure  [ flat ] .",
    "the lrs calibration from the sircus source is performed as follows .",
    "although light from the laser is essentially monochromatic , the signal measured at the lrs detector is extended in the dispersive ( @xmath94 ) direction due to the finite slit width ( @xmath95 pixels ) of the lrs . to collect all of the dispersed power ,",
    "the lrs signal is summed along the dispersion direction on each slit and then compared to the monochromatic laser radiance @xmath96 in nw / m@xmath4/sr .",
    "@xmath97 to directly compare the laser result with the white light result , the laser radiance was divided by the wavelength resolution of lrs @xmath98 ( see figure  [ resolution ] ) for matching units in nw / m@xmath4/sr / nm .",
    "we conducted this measurement three times , in 2008 , 2009 ( for the 1st flight ) , and 2010 ( for the 2nd flight ) . between these measurements ,",
    "the instrument was partially disassembled for servicing , including a change of the prism to remove a stray light path .",
    "the results of the laser measurement were consistent with each other within 5 % although some variation must be expected from servicing the instruments .",
    "however , the results of the white light measurement varied up to 30 % in the worst case due to bad repeatability of the absolute value from the white light measurements .",
    "therefore , we rely on the result from the laser measurement and the result from the white light measurement was used for interpolating between laser bands .",
    "the 5 % calibration variation could be due to the instrument disassembly and modifications between two measurements .",
    "data analysis at @xmath33 1.5 @xmath0 m is still in process because the calibration of the long - wavelength detectors is still being measured at nist .",
    "the average conversion curve over the array is shown in figure  [ responsivity ] . since",
    "this conversion curve was derived from the measurements with an integrated signal of @xmath99 e@xmath44 , a linearity correction up to 1.5 % is applied to compare with the flight data with the integrated signal of @xmath232000 e@xmath44  from the sky .",
    "the lrs is one of three ciber instruments .",
    "the primary scientific motivation for the lrs measurement is to determine the absolute spectrum of the diffuse sky brightness .",
    "the lrs is a 5-cm refracting telescope with a prism , operating at 0.75 @xmath0 m @xmath2 2.1 @xmath0 m with a spectral resolution of @xmath10015 - 30 .",
    "we evaluated the performance of lrs in the laboratory as described in this paper and found the following :    1 .",
    "the noise performance was consistent with design predictions .",
    "a linearity correction up to 1.5% is applied to compare the flight data with the laboratory calibration .",
    "image persistence was confirmed and is detectable following observations of bright stars at the level of @xmath23 0.2 % .",
    "a small electrical cross - talk of the incident signal injects @xmath23 0.35 % into other quadrants .",
    "the best fit psf size is consistent with one pixel and the encircled energy in the main pixel was @xmath3380% .",
    "the modified baffling scheme for stray thermal emission removal provided a dramatic improvement for angles @xmath101 , and the stray light signal from the earth is negligible for the range of angles observed in flight . 7 .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is approximately @xmath455% .",
    "combining all instrumental uncertainty described in this paper and the read noise obtained in flight gives a demonstrated sensitivity of @xmath85 nw / m@xmath4/sr  for a 25 second integration , 3@xmath102 , 1000 pixels as shown in figure  [ limit ] .",
    "the dominant component of uncertainty , @xmath455% , is from the instrument calibration . in the actual astronomical data analysis",
    ", there are other astronomical error elements rather than the instrumental systematics .",
    "the dominant error elements from astronomy come from the estimation of the zl and dgl brightness to subtract .",
    "details of such astronomical error evaluation will be discussed in future science papers .",
    "the first result of lrs from ciber 1st flight was summarized and published in @xcite based on the characterizations described in this paper , although some of them have been modified from the first flight to improve its performance .",
    "the 2nd flight data is under analysis now and the result will be reported in forthcoming papers .",
    "owing to the modifications especially to combat the thermal stray light , data with good quality enough to obtain the cnirb spectrum was acquired in the 2nd flight .",
