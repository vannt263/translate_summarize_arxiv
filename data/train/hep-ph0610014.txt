    "most expositions of dual model focus on its possible use as a framework for quark confinement in nature . rather than the confinement of color charges",
    ", we will here describe what one might call the phase transition in the dual yang - mills ( y - m ) theory at finite temperature @xmath0 .",
    "it is believed that the energy required grows linearly with the distance between the color charge and anticharge due to the formation of a color electric flux tube .",
    "the idea is that a charge or anticharge is a source or sink of color electric flux , which is the analog of ordinary electric flux for the strong interactions .",
    "but unlike ordinary electric flux , the color electric flux is expelled from the vacuum and is trapped in a thin flux tube connecting the color charge and anticharge .",
    "this is very similar to the way that a superconductor expels magnetic flux and traps it in thin tubes called abrikosov - gorkov vortex lines .",
    "+ there is a general statement that the color confinement is supported by the idea that the vacuum of quantum y - m theory is realized by a condensate of monopole - antimonople pairs [ 1 ] .",
    "in such a vacuum the interacting field between two colored sources located in @xmath1 and @xmath2 is squeezed into a tube whose energy @xmath3 .",
    "this is a complete dual analogy to the magnetic monopole confinement in the type ii superconductor .",
    "since there is no monopoles as classical solutions with finite energy in a pure y - m theory , it has been suggested by t hooft [ 2 ] to go into the abelian projection where the gauge group su(2 ) is broken by a suitable gauge condition to its ( may be maximal ) abelian subgroup u(1 ) .",
    "it is proposed that the interplay between a quark - antiquark pair is analogous to the interaction between a monopole - antimonopole pair in a superconductor .",
    "in fact , the topology of y - m su(n ) manifold and that of its abelian subgroup @xmath4^{n-1}$ ] are different , and since any such gauge is singular , one might introduce the string by performing the singular gauge transformation with an abelian gauge field @xmath5 [ 3 ] @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the angle subtended by the closed space - like curve described by the string at any point @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is responsible for the magnetic flux inside the string , @xmath10 being the y - m coupling constant . here , we choose a single string in the two - dimensional world sheet @xmath11 , for simplicity .",
    "obviously , the abelian field - strength tensor @xmath12 transforms as @xmath13 where a new term ( the dirac strength string tensor ) @xmath14 is valid on the world sheet only [ 4 ] @xmath15 formally , a gauge group element , which transforms a generic su(n ) connection onto the gauge fixing surface in the space of connections , is not regular everywhere in space - time .",
    "the projected ( or transformed ) connections contain topological singularities ( or defects ) .",
    "such a singular transformation ( [ e1 ] ) may form the worldline(s ) of magnetic monopoles . hence",
    ", this singularity leads to the monopole current @xmath16 .",
    "this is a natural way of the transformation from the y - m theory to a model dealing with abelian fields .",
    "a dual string is nothing but a formal idealization of a magnetic flux tube in the equilibrium against the pressure of surrounding superfluid ( the scalar higgs - like field ) which it displaces [ 5,6 ] .",
    "the lattice results , e.g. , [ 7 ] give the promised picture that the monopole degrees of freedom can indeed form a condensate responsible for the confinement . by lattice qcd simulations ,",
    "it is observed that large monopole clustering covers the entire physical vacuum in the confinement phase , which is identified as a signal of monopole condensation being responsible for confinement .",
    "the expression for the static heavy quark potential , using an effective dual ginzburg - landau model [ 8 ] , has been presented in [ 9 ] . in the paper [ 10 ] , an analytic approximation to the dual field propagator without sources and in the presence of quark sources , and an expression for the static quark - antiquark potential were established .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider the phase transition in the `` hot '' four - dimensional model based on the dual description of a long - distance y - m theory which shows some kind of confinement .",
    "we study the model of lagrangian where the fundamental variables are an octet of dual potentials coupled minimally to three octets of monopole ( higgs - like ) fields [ 11 ] .    in the scheme presented in this work , the flux distribution in the tubes formed between two heavy color charges is understood via the following statement : the abelian higgs - like monopoles are excluded from the string region while the abelian electric flux is squeezed into the string region .    in the model",
    "there are the dual gauge field @xmath17 and the scalar field @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ; @xmath20=1, ... ,8 is a color index ) which are relevant modes for infrared behaviour .",
    "the local coupling of the @xmath21-field to the @xmath22-field provides the mass of the dual field and , hence , a dual meissner effect .",
    "although @xmath23 is invariant under the local transformation of @xmath24 , @xmath25 is an @xmath26-gauge dependent object and does not appear in the real world alone ( @xmath27 is the number of colors and @xmath28 stands for the cartan superalgebra ) . the scope of commutation relations , two - pint wightman functions and green s functions as well - defined distributions in the space @xmath29 of complex schwartz test functions on @xmath30 , the monopole- and dual gauge - field propagations , the asymptotic transverse behaviour of both the dual gauge field and the color - electric field , the analytic expression for the static potential can be found in [ 11 ] .",
    "phase transitions in dual models are associated with a change in symmetry or more correctly these transitions are related with the breaking of symmetry . as a starting point we assume , for simplicity , that the model is characterized by the scalar order - parameter @xmath31 = @xmath32 for the scalar field @xmath33 identified in the dual model as the higgs - like field .",
    "the classical partition function looks like @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "the dual description of the y - m theory is simply understood by switching on the dual gauge field @xmath23 and the three scalar octets @xmath33 ( necessary to give mass to all @xmath36 and carrying color magnetic charge ) in the lagrangian density ( ld ) @xmath37 [ 12 ] @xmath38 - w\\left ( \\hat{b}_{i}\\right ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 @xmath40 the higgs - like fields develop their vacuum expectation values ( v.e.v . ) @xmath41 and the higgs potential @xmath42 has a minimum at @xmath41 of the order o ( 100 mev ) defined by the string tension and the higgs - like potential @xmath42 has a minimum at @xmath41 .",

    "these fields can not be experimentally observed as individual particles .",
    "+ it is believed that ld ( [ e3 ] ) can generate classical equations of motion carrying a unit of the @xmath58 flux confined in a narrow tube along the @xmath59-axis ( corresponding to quark sources at @xmath60 ) .",
    "this is a dual analogy to the abrikosov [ 13 ] magnetic vortex solution .",
    "+ the question is what happens with the flux tube in excited matter at nonzero temperature @xmath0 . at @xmath61",
    "the oscillations of the flux tube become visible up to the energy of excitation @xmath62 at certain entropy density @xmath63 . in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) the sum is taken over fields @xmath21 periodic in euclidean time @xmath64 with the period @xmath65 , and the thermal equilibrium in flat space - time at temperature @xmath0 is considered .",
    "the scalar higgs - like field is only part of the dual picture , however it is the only field that we shall make visible in the path integral ( [ e2 ] ) . the fourier expanding @xmath66 as @xmath67 can allow one to reflect the periodicity of @xmath66 in imaginary time .",
    "note , that the first term in ( [ e4 ] ) gives the zero - temperature mode while the other ones count the `` heavy '' high - temperature modes .",
    "+ we now move to a simple physical pattern : let us define the `` large '' and `` small '' systems .",

    "the value of the string tension ( [ e9 ] ) at @xmath103 is close to a phenomenological one ( e.g. , coming from the regge slope of the hadrons ) . making the formal comparison of the result obtained here in the analytic form",
