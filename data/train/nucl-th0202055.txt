    "quasi free scattering of high energy electrons ( qf ) on nuclei is the field of nuclear physics which is traditionally devoted to the study of the single particle aspects of nuclear structure : single particle binding energies , momentum distributions , occupation numbers , etc@xcite .    a new branch of these investigations  is the study of decay channels of single hole states in the residual nucleus , created as a result of the qf process .",
    "especially interesting is to study a fission decay following a qf process . in this case",
    "we have a single particle process in the first reaction stage , and essentially a collective process in the final reaction stage .",
    "the collective degrees of freedom are excited in the intermediate reaction stage due the residual interaction .",
    "this is a new sort of nuclear reaction which may allow one to get unique information on the dissociation of well defined single hole configurations ( which we can select by coincidence  @xmath10 ) into complex nuclear configurations , and its role in nuclear fission .",
    "the new and most important aspect of this reaction is that , after knocking - out a proton , we obtain the heavy nucleus @xmath1pa in a single hole doorway state ( see discussion below ) which could undergo  nuclear fission .",
    "indeed , instead of dealing with collective doorway states , which are coherent sums of a great number of 1p-1h configurations ( as the well - known giant resonances ) , these non - collective doorway states will be represented by only one , well defined , 1h configuration .",
    "the residual interaction in @xmath1pa mixes these 1h configurations into more complicate 2h-1p and 3h-2p ones .",
    "so , there would be some competing channels for fission .",
    "it may occur either directly from 1h configurations , or , with some delay , from mixed states ( or their components ) . in a qf process",
    "we have in the initial state only one configuration ; thus , the fission probability @xmath11 should be more sensitive to the individual structure of this initial state as compared with conventional reactions , where the effects of the structure are averaged out over many single particle states forming the doorway .",
    "the unambiguous extraction of single hole contributions is possible only in an exclusive experimental scheme ( reaction @xmath12 @xmath13 ) and involves extremely thin targets ( fission fragments have to leave the target with small energy losses ) , high energy resolution , and coincidence requirement between the final particles in order to separate the single hole states .",
    "the exclusive @xmath14-experiment is very difficult for practical realization , and never has been so far performed .",
    "the integral contribution of the quasi free electron scattering to the fission process was studied only in inclusive experiments : @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "these works dealt only with the issue of the qf contribution in electrofission .",
    "the advent of high energy , cw , electron accelerators combined with the development of high resolution facilities , opens the  possibility of studying the fission channel for quasi free electron scattering in an exclusive experimental setup .",
    "the most suitable accelerator for this experiment is at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) .    for excitation of the residual nucleus to an well defined single hole state",
    ", the initial and final state interactions have to be negligible .",
    "this situation corresponds to high momentum transfer and high proton exit energy ,  when the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) for the calculation of the quasi free electron scattering cross section is valid .",
    "this work presents the results of a pwia  calculations for the quasi free @xmath17-differential cross section for deformed orbitals of @xmath18u , in the framework of the macroscopic - microscopic approach ,  plus an estimate of the fissility  for single hole states in the residual nucleus @xmath19pa , performed on the statistical theory grounds .",
    "these  calculations could serve as first order magnitude guide - line for expected cross sections .",
    "in the first order born approximation the electron with initial four - momentum @xmath20 and final  @xmath21 , transfers  a virtual photon with four - momentum @xmath22 ,  resulting  in the final state  a knocked - out  nucleon  with @xmath23 and  a residual nucleus with @xmath24 .    in the impulse approximation",
