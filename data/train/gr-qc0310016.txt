    "let @xmath0 be a spacetime , and consider the minimally coupled , massive klein - gordon equation for a real scalar field in this spacetime : @xmath1 as is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , if @xmath0 is globally hyperbolic , the klein - gordon equation is well posed .",
    "that is , given smooth data on a spatial ( cauchy ) hypersurface @xmath2 , there exists a unique smooth solution @xmath3 with the given initial data . in a non - globally - hyperbolic spacetime ,",
    "however , no similar result holds .",
    "it is possible that no solution exists to given initial data , or , if solutions exist , there may be many which satisfy the initial condition . on the other hand , an analysis of einstein s equation led penrose to his `` strong '' cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite , which postulates that all `` reasonable '' spacetimes are globally hyperbolic . for these reasons ,",
    "the study of dynamics has often been restricted to globally hyperbolic spacetimes .    in the absence of strong evidence either for or against cosmic censorship , wald @xcite considered whether a sensible prescription could be given to define dynamics in a non - globally - hyperbolic spacetime .",
    "he studied stably causal , static spacetimes , that is , spacetimes with a hypersurface orthogonal killing vector field , whose orbits are complete and everywhere timelike . in these spacetimes ,",
    "the klein - gordon equation can be split into its spatial and temporal parts , leading to a second - order equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the norm of the killing field and @xmath6 the spatial covariant derivative .",
    "the operator @xmath7 is a positive symmetric operator on an appropriate hilbert space of initial data .",
    "thus , at least one self - adjoint extension , . ]",
    "the friedrichs extension , always exists @xcite .",
    "the standard calculus of self - adjoint operators ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) can therefore be used to define a solution @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes some self - adjoint extension of @xmath7 ( not necessearily the friedrichs extension @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 the initial field configuration , and @xmath12 the initial canonical momentum ( the canonical momentum is @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the unit normal to the static slices ) . for initial data in @xmath15 ,",
    "this solution is smooth throughout spacetime , agrees with the classical solution within the domain of dependence @xmath16 , and solves the klein - gordon equation in the pointwise ( spacetime ) sense .",
    "thus , the map @xmath17 assigns to each initial datum pair a unique solution with sensible properties , and thus gives rise to a reasonable prescription in the sense defined by wald and ishibashi @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite establishes that any reasonable prescription must correspond to the one above for some choice of positive , self - adjoint extension @xmath9 . in this sense",
    ", the choice of extension encodes the `` boundary conditions at the singularity '' ( or whatever feature gives rise to the non - globally - hyperbolicity ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with a similar prescription for stably casual , stationary spacetimes , i.e. , those which possess a complete 1-parameter family of timelike symmetries whose orbits are not necessarily hypersurface orthogonal . in this case",
    ", there are `` mixed space - time derivatives '' in the klein - gordon equation , so the division into space and time parts of the equation that was done in ( [ eq : static_eq ] ) is no longer possible . however ,",
    "following kay @xcite by rewriting the klein - gordon equation in hamiltonian form and using an `` energy - norm '' hilbert space , the time - evolution operator can be made into a skew - symmetric operator .",
    "when this operator can be extended to a skew - adjoint operator , a prescription analogous to ( [ eq : static_sol ] ) can be given .",
    "in contrast to the static case , it is not known _ a priori _ that any skew - adjoint extension of the time - evolution operator exists . however ,",
    "if the killing field does not approach a null vector ( in a precise sense explained further in section [ sec : prescription ] ) , it is possible to show that skew - adjoint extensions exist when fields with positive mass are considered . under these same conditions , this prescription preserves the important properties of the second - order prescription : it agrees with the differential equation within the domain of dependence , and smooth data of compact support give rise to smooth solutions .",
    "further , in the static case it is possible to compare the first and second - order formalisms and show that they agree so long as the freidrichs extension @xmath10 is used in ( [ eq : static_sol ] ) .",
    "an interesting contrast between the first and second - order formalisms becomes apparent during this analysis . in the second - order formalism",
    ", a single hilbert space can be used to define all reasonable dynamics , and the `` boundary conditions at the singularity '' are determined by the choice of self - adjoint extension . in order to handle different boundary conditions , the first - order formalism must be modified to allow for different hilbert spaces . within each one , there is only one skew - adjoint extension of the time - evolution operator .",
    "hence the choice of hilbert space , not of skew - adjoint extension , determines the dynamics and thus encodes the boundary conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : operators ] reviews the theory of self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators and proves a corresponding result regarding skew - adjoint extensions of skew - symmetric operators .",
    "section [ sec : prescription ] introduces the prescription in detail . in section [ sec : properties ] , it is shown that skew - adjoint extensions of the time - evolution operator exist .",
    "it is further shown that the prescription agrees with the differential equation within the domain of dependence and that smooth data of compact support give rise to smooth solutions .",
    "section [ sec : static ] examines the static case and compares the first and second - order formalisms . as defining the space of classical solutions",
    "is the first step towards field quantization , section [ sec : quantum ] show how this prescritption may be used to extend the well - known constructions of globally hyperbolic spacetimes to non - globally - hyperbolic ones .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes with some open problems .",
    "although it is common in the physics literature to treat symmetric operators ( also called hermitian operators ) as equivalent to self - adjoint operators , these two classes are in fact distinct .",
    "the key difference is that arbitrary functions ( and , in particular , the exponential ) of self - adjoint operators may be defined , whereas this is not true of a general symmetric operator .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the proper definition of an operator involves not only specifying its action on vectors but also its domain . a symmetric operator @xmath7 on a hilbert space @xmath18 is a linear operator defined on a dense vector subspace @xmath19 , which `` acts the same to the left or to the right '' for all vectors in its domain : @xmath20 a self - adjoint operator is a symmetric operator whose domain is equal to the domain of its adjoint .",
    "while @xmath21 may be freely chosen provided it is a dense vector subspace of @xmath18 , the domain of @xmath22 is fixed once @xmath7 is defined .",
    "the somewhat convoluted definition is as follows : @xmath23 if and only if @xmath24 such that @xmath25 in which case @xmath26 notice that for a symmetric operator , @xmath21 is automatically contained in @xmath27 , so if the domains are not equal then @xmath28 .",
    "the equality of domains for self - adjoint operators is crucial to the proof of the spectral theorem , which allows arbitrary ( measurable ) functions of the operator to be defined . for a (",
    "closed , ) symmetric , non - self - adjoint operator , functions may only be defined by a power series , but this series will always diverge unless it has a finite number of terms .",
    "the close relationship between symmetric and self - adjoint operators suggests that a symmetric operator can be turned into self - adjoint operator by enlarging its domain of definition . that this is often the case for operators acting on a complex hilbert space is a consequence of a famous theorem of von neumann @xcite .",
    "[ thm : neumann ] let @xmath18 be a hilbert space over @xmath29 and @xmath30 a symmetric operator .",
    "let @xmath31 , and define @xmath32 .",
    "self - adjoint extensions of @xmath7 exist if and only if , in which case they are parametrized by the group @xmath33 .",
    "the indices @xmath34 are called the deficiency indices . if , there is a unique self - adjoint extension and @xmath7 is called essentially self - adjoint .",
    "a standard technique for proving that the deficiency indices are equal is the use of a complex conjugation operator .",
    "any involution ( i.e. , an operator whose square is the identity ) @xmath35 is called a complex conjugation if it is antilinear and norm preserving .",
    "suppose that @xmath36 obeys @xmath37 .",
    "assume further that @xmath38 some complex conjugation operator @xmath35 which commutes with @xmath7 .",
    "for any operator @xmath7 , not necessarily symmetric , @xmath39 = 0 $ ] implies that @xmath40 = 0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "thus , it follows that @xmath41 ; that is , @xmath35 establishes an isomorphism between @xmath42 and @xmath43 so that the deficiency indices are equal .",
    "von neumann also proved an extension of this result @xcite .",
    "[ thm : commute ] let @xmath18 be a hilbert space over @xmath29 and @xmath44 a symmetric operator .",
    "if @xmath45 a complex conjugation @xmath46 with @xmath39=0 $ ] , then ( i ) @xmath7 has self - adjoint extensions , and ( ii ) @xmath38 self - adjoint extensions of @xmath7 with @xmath35-invariant domain .",
    "the previous two theorems only apply to complex hilbert spaces .",
    "however , the theory of extensions on a real hilbert space is naturally related to the theory on complex spaces by the following proposition .",
    "[ prop : sym_extend ] let @xmath47 be a hilbert space over @xmath48 , @xmath49 a symmetric operator , and @xmath50 the corresponding operator acting on @xmath51 the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath7 are in 1 - 1 correspondence with those self - adjoint extensions of @xmath50 whose domain is invariant under @xmath52 , the natural complex conjugation operator defined on @xmath53 .",
    "this result is implicit in the original work of von neumann and stone ( * ? ?",
    "? * theorems 8.1 and 9.14 ) . since @xmath50 obviously commutes with @xmath54 ,",
    "parts ( i ) and ( ii ) of theorem [ thm : commute ] combined with proposition [ prop : sym_extend ] trivially show :    [ prop : sym_exist ] let @xmath47 be a hilbert space over @xmath48 .",
    "any symmetric operator has self - adjoint extensions .    in his original work @xcite",
    ", wald used the positivity of the operator @xmath7 in ( [ eq : static_eq ] ) to assert the existence of self - adjoint extensions .",
    "however , proposition [ prop : sym_exist ] shows that this was unnecessary .",
    "existence follows directly from the fact that @xmath7 is a symmetric operator defined on a real hilbert space .",
    "the operator considered in the present work is not symmetric but rather skew - symmetric ( or anti - hermitian ) .",
    "skew - symmetric",
    "operators share many properties of symmetric operators , but pick up a minus sign when the operator is transposed from the bra to the ket ( or conversely ) : @xmath55 in the case of a complex hilbert space , there is a one - to - one correspondence between symmetric and skew - symmetric operators because multiplication by @xmath56 turns one type of operator into the other .",
    "thus , the analogue of theorem [ thm : neumann ] is trivial . in the real hilbert space case",
    "there is no such correspondence because multiplication by @xmath56 is not a well - defined operation .",

    "it is replaced by the condition @xmath66 agrees with @xmath67 .",
    "von neumann and stone s original analysis of real symmetric operators was based on detailed properties of the cayley transform , and thus their results could not be easily extended to skew - symmetric operators . ]",

    "another straightforward computation establishes that @xmath58 is skew - adjoint .",
    "equivalently , since composition with @xmath56 does not change the domain , the skew - adjoint extensions of @xmath7 are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath73 with @xmath54-invariant domain . here , a key a difference between self - adjoint and skew - adjoint operators arises .",
    "since @xmath74 anticommutes , rather than commutes , with @xmath52 , @xmath52 relates the spaces @xmath75 to themselves rather than to each other .",
    "thus , @xmath74 may not have any self - adjoint extensions .",
    "a standard example is the operator @xmath76 on @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath7 is skew - symmetric , but @xmath73 has deficiency indices @xmath78 in @xmath79 , so that @xmath7 possesses no skew - adjoint extensions . a key step in later sections will be establishing , in theorem [ thm : exist ] , that skew - adjoint extensions of the time - evolution operator do indeed exist .",
    "let @xmath80 be a non - globally - hyperbolic , connected , stably causal , stationary spacetime .",
    "a crucial property of these spacetimes for this prescription is the following :    if @xmath0 is a connected , stably causal , stationary spacetime , then there exists a smoothly embedded spatial hypersurface @xmath2 which intersects each orbit of the killing field exactly once .",
    "* proof . *",
    "since @xmath0 is stably causal , it posseses a smooth global time function @xcite , i.e. , a function @xmath81 such that @xmath82 is a past directed timelike vector field .",
    "consider @xmath83 , and without loss of generality take the killing field @xmath84 to be future directed . as @xmath82 is past",
    "directed , it follows that @xmath85 is a strictly increasing function on the orbits of @xmath84 , and hence no orbit can intersect @xmath83 more than once . on the other hand ,",
    "suppose , to the contrary , that there is some orbit @xmath86 of @xmath84 which does not intersect @xmath83 . again without loss of generality , take @xmath86 to be entirely to the future of @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath87 , the boundary of the chronological future of @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath58 is non - empty since the open set @xmath88 does not intersect the open set @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is connected .",
    "let @xmath91 be the isometry corresponding to flowing each point of @xmath90 by killing parameter @xmath92 . since @xmath84 is complete , @xmath93 furthermore , @xmath94 this means that @xmath95 , or , equivalently , that @xmath84 is tangent to @xmath58 .",
    "however , @xmath58 , as the boundary of the chronological future of a set , is generated by null geodesics , and so can not have a timelike tangent vector .",
    "therefore , each orbit of @xmath84 must intersect @xmath83 exactly once .",
    "@xmath83 is also automatically smoothly embedded by the inverse function theorem , so it may be taken to be the surface @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath72    it may appear that the assumption of stable causality is an overly restrictive causality condition . however , the key property of @xmath90 from the standpoint of the prescription is the existence of the initial surface @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , any stationary spacetime containing such a surface is automatically stably causal , as the killing parameter may be used to define a global time function on @xmath96 hence , stable causality is precisely the right causality assumption .",

''",
    "it should be noted that while @xmath117 is a natural choice of hilbert space associated to the system , other choices are possible .",
    "that is , it is possible to define an energy norm which agrees with the above definition on smooth data of compact support but is defined on a larger set of functions . in section [ sec : static ] , it will be shown that other choices for @xmath117 can be used to define different dynamics , although the definitions of @xmath113 and @xmath118 ( below ) would then need to be modified somewhat .",

    "formally , the time - evolution equation may be solved by exponentiating @xmath118 .",
    "however , this may not be possible unless @xmath118 is extended to a skew - adjoint operator @xmath125 .",
    "skew - adjoint operators have a spectral decomposition similar to that of symmetric operators ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , it is not clear _ a priori _ that ( i ) this one - parameter family defines a smooth function on spacetime for smooth initial data of compact support , or that ( ii ) it solves the klein - gordon equation in the pointwise ( spacetime ) sense when the initial data are sufficiently regular .    in order to make any progress in proving ( i ) and ( ii )",
    ", two technical assumptions are made .",
    "it is possible that these assumption are not needed , but the methods of proof used section [ sec : properties ] break down .",
    "the first assumption restricts consideration to the massive klein - gordon equation : @xmath127 [ cond : mass ] guarantees that any @xmath128 is automatically in @xmath129 , where @xmath130 denotes the @xmath131th local sobolev space ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this ensures that all the vectors in @xmath117 are functions and not distributions .",
    "the second assumption is a condition on @xmath5 and @xmath132 : @xmath133 notice that since @xmath5 is manifestly positive , this condition implies @xmath134 as well as @xmath135 however , if @xmath5 diverges then [ cond : beta ] is strictly stronger than the condition that the norm of killing is bounded away from zero . also notice that since it involves @xmath101 , [ cond : beta ] is a condition on the slice @xmath2 as well as the killing field .",
    "roughly speaking , [ cond : beta ] implies that the `` lorentz boost '' taking the unit normal @xmath102 to @xmath136 is bounded , so that the two vectors do not `` approach being null with respect to one another . ''",
    "a straightforward computation shows that these two conditions together ensure that @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is some constant depending only on @xmath139 and @xmath104 .",
    "one easy consequence of this inequality is that the symplectic form on smooth , compactly supported functions , defined by @xmath140 is a continuous bilinear form on @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath38 some constant @xmath141 so that @xmath142 this inequality follows from the fact that @xmath119 is a bounded operator on @xmath143 combined with the fact that @xmath113-norm bounds @xmath143-norm , and it means that @xmath144 extends uniquely to a continuous bilinear form on all of @xmath117 .",
    "this will be critical in in the analysis of section [ sec : properties ] , which shows that ( i ) is true and that ( ii ) is true so long as @xmath145 is smooth and @xmath146 .    to summarize , the prescription is as follows .",
    "first , choose any smoothly embedded spatial hypersurface which intersects each orbit of the killing vector field exactly once and satisfies [ cond : beta ] .",
    "second , define the hilbert space @xmath117 with the norm given by equations ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : a - norm ] ) , as well as the operator @xmath118 on @xmath111 by ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "finally , choose an arbitrary skew - adjoint extension of @xmath118 and assign the solution ( [ eq : phi_t ] ) to each initial datum @xmath147 . naively , then , two arbitrary choices  the choice of initial surface and the choice of skew - adjoint extension  plus a possible third choice , if @xmath117 may be replaced by some larger hilbert space , are allowed in the prescription . however , as shown in section [ sec : static ] , @xmath118 is essentially skew - adjoint in static spacetimes .",
    "even if @xmath118 is not always essentially skew - adjoint , theorem [ thm : exist ] shows that there is always a preferred skew - adjoint extension .",
    "both these facts suggest that there is considerably less freedom available than at first appears . finally , whether the prescription gives rise to the same dynamics when inequivalent slicings in the same spacetime are used remains an open question .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove two theorems .",
    "the first assumes the existence of skew - adjoint extensions of @xmath118 , and proves that any such extension gives rise to a prescription with reasonable properties .",

    "see @xcite or @xcite for the details . ) as @xmath144 is skew - symmetric and bounded on @xmath374 , there is a unique , bounded , skew - adjoint operator @xmath376 on @xmath374 such that @xmath377 define a new inner product on @xmath172 by @xmath378 where @xmath379 denotes the `` absolute value '' of @xmath376 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the state defined by @xmath380 is pure in addition to being quasifree , and hence is a vacuum state @xcite .",
    "chmielowski further showed that if @xmath372 is the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ( rescaled so that it saturates the inequality ( [ eq : quasifree ] ) ) , then the vacuum state so defined is the well - known `` frequency - splitting '' ground state associated to a timelike killing field .    the assumption of global hyperbolicity was used subtly in the above argument , allowing the identification of @xmath111 with the space of solutions .",
    "this meant that the symplectic form defined via the integral ( [ eq : sigma ] ) was well - defined on the space of solutions @xmath172 because it is non - degenerate and conserved for solutions of the wave equation .",
    "similarly , the norm @xmath372 on the space of solutions could be defined via an integral on some spatial slice because there was a natural identification of solutions with initial data on that slice . in the non - globally - hyperbolic case ,",
    "the situtation is much more complicated . in the absence of any prescription for selecting solutions ,",
    "a given initial datum might be identified with many different solutions of the equation .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) would fail to define an inner product because there would be non - zero solutions which have zero norm .",
    "worse yet , the sympletic form ( [ eq : sigma ] ) would fail to be non - degenerate .",
    "thus , the quantum vacuum can not be defined because the space of all solutions to the wave equation is `` too large . '' by analogy with the globally hyperbolic space , one might try to define a smaller space @xmath381 by requiring that the solutions be compactly supported on all spatial slices .",
    "however , the time evolution carries @xmath111 data to non - compactly supported data , in general , and thus @xmath111 is `` too small '' as the initial data set .",

    "further , @xmath144 extends to a bounded bilinear form on @xmath117 , so that @xmath117 is a `` small enough '' space to have a well - defined symplectic structure .",
    "if one uses the extension @xmath382 ( where @xmath222 is as in the proof of theorem [ thm : exist ] ) , @xmath144 is conserved for all solutions with initial data in @xmath383 , so that space can be identified with a space of solutions . since the prescription automatically conserves @xmath113-norm , if an inner product @xmath372 is defined by @xmath384 ( plus appropraite rescaling to satisfy ( [ eq : quasifree ] ) ) , then @xmath385 .",

    "hence , @xmath389 has a `` mass gap '' and thus avoids `` infrared divergences '' in its quantum vacuum .",
    "the foregoing analysis , along with the results of @xcite , @xcite that in certain static spacetimes the operator @xmath7 is not essentially self - adjoint , shows there are many different `` energy splitting '' ground states possible in a non - globally - hyperbolic spacetime . in these static spacetimes",

    "this contrasts sharply with the globally hyperbolic case , where each timelike killing field defines a unique ground state , and different timelike killing fields almost always give rise to the same `` frequency - splitting '' ground state  @xcite .",

    "nonetheless , the present work leaves many questions unanswered .",
    "first and foremost among these is whether the prescriptions given by using the first - order formalism with different slicings in the same spacetime give rise to the same dynamics . while it is easy to construct examples of spacetimes with inequivalent slicings satisfying [ cond : beta ] where the static slices are `` rotated into the time direction . ''",

    "it seems sensible that the preferred extension @xmath393 would give rise to the same solutions in any slicing , but this remains to be shown .",

    "however , it is not known whether theorems 4.1 or 4.2 fail without these assumptions , or whether ( a ) and ( b ) are only needed because of the method of proof used . along these same lines",
    ", it would be interesting to compare the first and second - order formalisms in static spacetimes when [ cond : beta ] is dropped .",
    "if they could be shown to agree , then the results of theorem [ thm : main ] would follow from the proof in the second - order formalism , without imposing [ cond : beta ] ( and possibly [ cond : mass ] ) . on the other hand , when [ cond : beta ] fails , it is no longer true that @xmath270-norm bounds some multiple of @xmath276-norm .",
    "hence @xmath270 may properly contain @xmath277 , which considerably complicates the analysis of    all of these question deal purely with the classical theory , but there are questions regarding the quantum theory as well .",
