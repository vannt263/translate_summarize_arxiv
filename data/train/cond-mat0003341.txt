    "the interactions among grains and between grains and the boundaries influence profoundly the macroscopic behavior of granular systems .",
    "to study such complex many body systems , numerical simulations are frequently used where one of the most important ingredients are the collision laws introduced to treat interactions  @xcite . for dilute assemblies of grains one can use molecular dynamics algorithms where",
    "periodic boundary conditions are usually used .",
    "if the system is initially in a square box , a particle going out on the left re - enters the system on the right .",
    "we will show below that this kind of boundary condition modifies the general dynamics of the grains and introduces large correlations in time .",
    "this changes the diffusive behavior of the grains . in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative approach to calculate numerically the coefficient of diffusion , accurately and with only very small finite size effects . to validate our methods , we compare our results for an elastic gas with the langevin theory .    as granular gases",
    "are dissipative it is necessary to feed energy into the system to keep the particles agitated . to thermalize the system , we choose a random acceleration added to each grain at regular time step intervals @xmath2 .",
    "our final goal in this paper is to study the dependence of the dynamic properties of the granular gas on the mode used to force the system .",
    "this work is a first step towards understanding the diffusion process in a binary system composed of two grain sizes .",
    "the system considered here is composed of one particle , * s * , of radius @xmath0 in a sea of particles of radius @xmath1 .",
    "the particles are spheres constrained to move in a plane and which interact along their equators so that the system is two dimensional .",
    "the system considered here is dilute with a packing fraction of 30 % .",
    "the simulations are done with the molecular dynamics algorithms ( _ time step driven _",
    "@xcite and _ event driven _",
    "@xcite ) .    to characterize the diffusive behavior , we focus on the mean square displacement of the * s * particle .",
    "it is well known that for a 2d gas , the integral of the auto - correlation function does not converge  @xcite .",
    "this means that the mean square displacement does not vary linearly with time .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , we can not define a diffusion coefficient in 2d .",
    "however , we show that in a limited range of time , in the stationary state , the mean square displacement can be approximated by the linear function : @xmath3 where @xmath4 can be interpreted as a diffusion coefficient . all quantities are expressed in arbitrary units .",
    "in this section we show that periodic boundary conditions introduce strong correlations and therefore alter the diffusion process .",
    "consistent with common practice , we have used periodic boundary conditions to simulate a system of identical spheres @xmath5 .",
    "initially the particles are placed randomly in a square box of length @xmath6 .",
    "the number of particles is calculated for each system depending on @xmath6 , @xmath0 and the packing fraction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in both directions . in this case , for elastic or forced gases ( section  [ therm ] ) , we have observed a strong dependence of @xmath4 ( or of the mean square displacement ) on the system size .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : perio ] , we have plotted the mean square displacement @xmath7 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : perio]a ) and @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perio]b ) , both calculated in the stationary state , as function of @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the normalized autocorrelation function : @xmath11 first , we note that the mean square displacement , at large time , varies linearly with time as expected but the slope of the curve , i.e. the diffusion coefficient , increases with system size .",
    "we show , in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : perio]a , that this dependence on @xmath6 appears already at short time , when @xmath12 .",
    "this feature can be also observed in @xmath13 , which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient .",
    "similarly , we observe that the relaxation time @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 ) increases with size . in summary , the bigger the system is , the longer the characteristic time @xmath14 and the larger the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 are .",
    "we recall that such dependence has been observed by alder _ et al _",
    "they proposed the following law for the dependence of @xmath4 on the number of particles , @xmath16 , @xmath17 however their numerical simulations do not support this conjecture  @xcite since they fail to observe any saturation of @xmath4 for large systems .",
    "in addition , they found strong correlations in the velocity field characterized by the presence of vortex flow pattern at the microscopic scale .",
    "our results confirm the lack of convergence for @xmath4 with system size .",
    "in addition , this variation of @xmath4 with @xmath6 is also observed in the case of inelastic collisions .",
    "another important remark is in order .",
    "if the system size is , for example , 60 ( with 1400 particles of radius @xmath18 ) , the characteristic time @xmath14 is found to be around @xmath19 which represents about 200 collisions for a particle .",
    "this means that a particle needs to undergo 200 collisions to lose completely the memory of its past .",
    "according to the boltzmann theory this time should be limited to only a few collisions .",
    "therefore we can not accept this result as a valid macroscopic description of a gas .",
    "it is worth noting that the same results are found for both , the time step driven and the event driven algorithms .",
    "we now discuss some points helpful for understanding the problem .",
    "initially , each particle has a random velocity drawn from a maxwellian distribution .",
    "we shift the linear and angular momenta so that the system has zero center of mass momentum and zero angular momentum relative to the center of mass .",
    "we find , however , that , although the system keeps its center of mass at rest throughout the simulation , the system is no longer isotropic , its moment of inertia becoming that of an ellipsoid .",
    "let @xmath20 be the inertia matrix of the system .",
    "its two eigenvalues @xmath21 and @xmath22 are related via @xmath23 where the sum is over all @xmath16 particles each of mass @xmath24 .",
    "following @xmath21 and @xmath22 in time shows that the system takes an ellipsoidal form ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we have found , as well , an anisotropy in the diffusion tensor @xmath26 defined from @xmath20 as : @xmath27 as example we show , in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1d2 ] the two eigenvalues @xmath28 and @xmath29 of @xmath30 as functions of @xmath9 for a particular periodic system .",
    "clearly , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are very different for all @xmath9 .",
    "for all systems we studied , we found two different diffusion coefficients which depend strongly the system size .",
    "we were not able to find how these values scale with @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , we have found that , contrary to its initial condition , the system starts to rotate .",
    "this fact is put in evidence by calculating the two eigenvectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 of @xmath20 .",
    "these two ( perpendicular ) vectors rotate in space and , most importantly , they keep the same direction of rotation for a long time ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we suspect that this rotation induces an anomalous temporal correlation of velocities .",
    "one should point out that this rotation phenomenon seems similar to that observed by alder _",
    "et al _ in their simulations with similar periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we strongly believe that the use of periodic boundary conditions is responsible for this anomalous correlation .",
    "these boundary conditions present another inconvenience which is connected with the rotation of the system : the square geometry of the system does not permit the conservation of distances between two particles when the system is rotating . in fig .",
    "[ fig : iandj ] we show that after a rotation of @xmath34 the distance @xmath35 between particles @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be drastically changed by the rotation if one of them goes through the boundary . because the distance between particles is not conserved by rotation ,",
    "the interaction potential used in the algorithm , which depends only on the relative positions of particles @xmath35 , is itself not invariant under rotation and so the angular momentum of the system is not conserved .",
    "effectively the total angular momentum is fluctuating as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : lz - t ] .",
    "every time a particle goes through the boundary , its angular momentum , @xmath38 , changes sign .",
    "consequently , the change in angular momentum is @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is always proportional to @xmath6 ( the system size ) and the total number of particles , @xmath16 , is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "however it appears that the fluctuations of @xmath42 get bigger with system size ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lz - t ] ) .",
    "the use of periodic boundary conditions amounts to replicating the system on a square lattice .",
    "there are , therefore , several identical systems which interact through the boundaries .",
    "the rotation observed in our system is then extended to all these systems and can create some shear stress , due to frustration of rotation , between neighboring systems .",
    "these boundary conditions can have other consequences on the dynamics of granular systems .",
    "for example , during the simulation of a cooling state the system evolves towards clusters  @xcite whose orientation depends on the type of boundary conditions  @xcite . in other similar simulations",
    "@xcite it was shown that there exist large spatial correlations between particles where the velocities stay correlated over a distance of about @xmath43 .      in the case of reflecting boundaries",
    "the system is rotationally invariant leading to better behavior of the mean square displacement .",
    "however , in this case , the mean square displacement is limited at long time by the system size . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "the test particle * s * is initially put at the center of system at @xmath44 .",
    "the evolution of the position and velocity of this test particle are then followed until it reaches the boundary of the system in time @xmath45 .",
    "we then repeat this many times collecting statistics for many test particles with different initial velocities .",
    "the mean square displacement is calculated over 500 such trajectories and limited to time smaller than the smallest @xmath45 . in this case , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : r2_wall ] , there is no dependence of the mean square displacement on the system size .",
    "therefore , we can now trust the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "we recall that the integral of the velocity correlation function does not converge in 2d .",
    "however , in a limited range of time ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : r2_wall ] ) , the quantity @xmath7 can be approximated by a straight line and @xmath4 calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) .",
    "therefore , the estimate of @xmath4 with this method is an approximation .",
    "we first validate our algorithm using reflecting boundaries for an elastic gas ( i.e. , where the collision between particles are elastic ) .",
    "then , we compare the numerical results with those given by the langevin equation .",
    "indeed , near equilibrium , the dynamics of * s * can be described approximately , by a langevin equation : @xmath46 where @xmath36 denotes the two direction @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang1 ] ) , the dependence of the mean square velocity on time is simply given by : @xmath49 in this paper @xmath50 denotes the instantaneous velocity of one particle and @xmath51 the mean square velocity averaged over the different * s * trajectories .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang3 ] ) using the mean square velocity in the equilibrium state @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 corresponds to the relaxation time .",
    "for example , if @xmath55 or , equivalently , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the mass of the particle of radius @xmath58 ) , @xmath54 is very large : the collision of * s * with a light particle @xmath59 will not affect strongly the velocity of * s*. so a great number of collisions is needed before * s * reaches its equilibrium state . knowing the total kinetic energy of the system @xmath60 ( which is given by the initial velocity of each particle )",
    ", we can easily calculate the square velocity in the equilibrium state @xmath52 ( using the boltzmann distribution law for elastic gases ) . using the simulations to calculate @xmath61 for the * s * particles for initial conditions which are very different from the stationary state ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath62 and comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang4 ] ) , we obtain the relaxation time for a big ( heavy ) particle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lange ] ) . note that we are looking for agreement near the equilibrium state , where eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang1 ] ) is valid .",
    "indeed the dissipation term @xmath63 must depend on both velocities @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as we will show .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : lang1 ] ) also gives the mean square displacement as a function of time , @xmath66 comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang5 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) at large time , the coefficient of diffusion is seen to be @xmath67 . in fig .",

    "( [ eq : lang5 ] ) , with the numerical one , obtained for the case @xmath68 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang5 ] ) all the parameters are known .",
    "clearly , the agreement is very good .",
    "this confirms that even for a large test particle , the motion is well described by the simple langevin equation .",
    "this observation , while reasonable , is not trivial since the limited size of our system and the radius of the particles are comparable to the mean free path .    we can now present a theoretical calculation of @xmath63 which describes dissipation in the langevin equation for all pairs ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) . this will allow us to compare the theoretical values with the numerical ones as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath63 depends on both velocities , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . to estimate theoretically the value of @xmath63",

    "the dissipative term @xmath71 appearing in eq .",
