    "a neutron star can interact with a surrounding disk in a variety of modes .",
    "these different modes of interaction can lead to various astrophysical manifestations and are of key importance in classifying neutron stars .",
    "the mode of interaction and hence the evolutionary stage is determined by the location of the inner radius of the disk with respect to the characteristic radii , the corotation radius @xmath4 and the light cylinder radius @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the angular velocity and @xmath7 is the mass of the neutron star . starting with the pioneering work of @xcite , three basic modes of interaction accretor , propeller and ejector @xcite of a neutron star with a surrounding disk have been identified .",
    "if the inner radius of the disk is beyond the corotation radius , the system is expected to be in the propeller stage @xcite .",
    "the ejector ( radio pulsar ) stage is assumed to commence when inner radius is also beyond the light cylinder radius .",
    "the disk should be disrupted in the region where magnetic and matter stresses are comparable @xcite and the inner radius of the disk , @xmath8 , is estimated by balancing the kinetic energy density ( half the ram pressure ) of the disk with the electromagnetic energy density ( same as electromagnetic pressure ) of the radiation generated by the neutron star . in order that the equilibrium found in this way is stable , the electromagnetic energy density at @xmath9 should be greater than the kinetic energy density , i.e.the electromagnetic energy density at @xmath8 should increase more steeply than the kinetic energy density in approaching the star @xcite . the usual estimate for the kinetic energy density",
    "has the dependence @xmath10 ( see  3 ) on the radial distance @xmath3 from the center of the neutron star . in the near zone ( @xmath11 ) where @xmath12 is",
    "the radius of the neutron star , electric energy density , @xmath13 , is negligible and the kinetic energy density is balanced essentially by the magnetic energy density , @xmath14 , of the dipole field of the neutron star at the alfvn radius .",
    "this is a stable equilibrium point because @xmath15 is steep enough to balance @xmath10 i.e. @xmath16 for @xmath9 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 . in the radiation zone ( @xmath19 ) where electromagnetic energy density @xmath20 , a stable inner boundary can not be found",
    "because then @xmath21 would be greater than @xmath22 for @xmath9 and @xmath16 for @xmath18 , and the disk is disrupted .",
    "this was first noticed by @xcite who with the above argument concluded that the stable equilibrium outside the light cylinder would only be possible beyond the gravitational capture radius @xcite .",
    "usual estimates employ a rotating magnetic dipole in vacuum to generate the electromagnetic fields of the neutron star . in the near zone ( @xmath11 )",
    "the magnetostatic energy density @xmath23 is employed , while in the radiation zone ( @xmath19 ) , at distances far outside the light cylinder , the radiation pressure @xmath24 , where @xmath2 is the poynting vector , is used . for simplicity one usually employs a piecewise defined electromagnetic energy density which scales as @xmath25 for @xmath26 and as @xmath27 for @xmath28 . with such a model one necessarily concludes that the disk will be disrupted if the inner radius of the disk goes beyond the light cylinder radius ( see figure  [ extra ] ) .    in this work we present the full expressions for electromagnetic pressure around a rotating dipole in vacuum , reducing to the conventional expressions in the near zone and the radiation zone , and describing the transition across the light cylinder .",
    "we use these results to investigate the location and stability of the alfvn radius and inner radius of thin keplerian disks .",
    "this information is relevant if the mass flow rate through the disk declines or the neutron star rotation period evolves such that the inner radius is beyond the light cylinder .",
    "according to the conventional pulsar magnetophere models @xcite , the pulsar activity can commence if the inner radius is outside the light cylinder . according to the simple piecewise model described above",
    ", the disk would be swept away . in the present model with a rather broad transition from the near zone to the radiation zone , there will be a wide range of allowed values for the mass flow rate for which the inner radius of the disk is outside the light cylinder while the disk can survive the radiation pressure . in this case",
    ", the pulsar activity will commence but depending on the inclination angle , the presence of the disk may destroy the coherent pulsed emission in the radio band .    in its quiescent stage ,",
    "the luminosity of the accretion driven millisecond pulsar @xcite drops below @xmath29 erg s@xmath30 @xcite . assuming the system passes through a propeller stage the mass inflow rate , which determines the inner radius , can be much greater than the mass accretion rate on to the star determining the luminosity .",
    "as we do not know what fraction of the inflowing mass can accrete in the propeller stage , we can not estimate the inner radius from the observed luminosity . assuming 1 per cent of the inflowing mass accretes on to the star",
    ", we would estimate an inner radius for the disk greater than the light cylinder .",
    "@xcite suggested that the optical properties of this source in the quiescent stage indicate an active pulsar ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we find that such a disk can survive the radiation pressure of a turned on rotation - powered pulsar",
    ". this may be the case in some stages of transients ( e.g. @xcite ) and of the evolution of young neutron stars if they have fallback disks @xcite .    in  2",
    "we derive the electromagnetic energy density from the global electromagnetic field solution of @xcite for obliquely rotating magnetic dipoles . in ",
    "3 we derive the inner radius of the disk . in  4 we discuss implications for the accretion driven millisecond pulsar which is probably representative of the millisecond x - ray pulsars , for certain other transients and for fallback disks around radio pulsars . in  5",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "a rotating dipole can radiate electromagnetic energy if the spin and magnetic axes are not aligned . a global solution for a perfectly conducting , rigidly rotating star in vacuum",
    "was first given by @xcite .",
    "the relevance of this solution for radio pulsars is thoroughly discussed by @xcite .    the early papers on pulsars @xcite employed the vacuum solutions of @xcite .",
    "the vacuum assumption can not actually be realized for neutron stars because the magnetospheric field itself is strong enough to tear off electrons from the surface of the neutron star .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that an axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere should have a corotating plasma described by the hydromagnetic approximation @xmath31 with a corresponding charge density @xmath32 .",
    "whether the pulsar electrodynamics is dominated by the @xcite currents , or by the vacuum fields modified by rather smaller currents is still of debate @xcite and a global self - consistent solution of the problem is yet to be presented .",
    "@xcite argued that the existence of a corotating plasma does not alter the field structure drastically because it simply means an effective increase in the radius of the conducting star ( see @xcite for an application of this idea ) using the @xcite solution .",
    "the presence of the disk might alter the field structure ( e.g. @xcite ) even more than the corotating plasma and further complicate the magnetospheric currents @xcite . in the absence of a consistent solution of the problem of the pulsar magnetosphere with corotating plasma with or without a disk",
    ", we , for simplicity , employ the @xcite solutions for a rotating dipole in vacuum .",
    "we quote the field solutions of @xcite , as corrected by @xcite , in the appendix , and use them in our estimation of the electromagnetic energy density at the disk plane . as maxwell s equations do not preserve their form in rotating coordinates the problem of rotating dipoles is intrinsically relativistic .",
    "these solutions can be shown to be the limiting case for slow rotation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as obtained in the appendix , the radial component of the poynting vector @xmath33 at the disk plane ( zenith angle @xmath34 ) averaged over a stellar period is @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the angle between the magnetic moment @xmath37 and the rotation rate @xmath38 of the neutron star , and @xmath39 .",

    "the kinetic energy density scales with @xmath67 ( see the following section ) .",
    "note that for all inclination angles @xmath68 i.e.  the electromagnetic energy density is steep enough to balance the kinetic energy density of the disk at the light cylinder .    the radius beyond which @xmath69 can be found by solving equation  ( [ eq_gamm ] ) for @xmath70 .",

    "it is not possible to find a solution for every @xmath87 , corresponding to the fact that at low mass transfer rates , the kinetic energy density of the disk can not match the electromagnetic energy density at any radius , and the disk will be ejected .",
    "the lowest mass flow rate for which the disk will not be ejected corresponds to the maximum @xmath88 as seen in figure  ( [ f4 ] ) . from @xmath89",

    "the source will probably be in a propeller phase with only a fraction of the mass inflow possibly being accreted while the rest is diverted into an outflow . when the inner radius of the disk is of the order of the corotation radius , accretion of the full mass flow rate is expected .",

    "this discussion applies to the other millisecond x - ray pulsars also .",
    "other transient low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) may also be in phases that include excursions of the inner disk towards and beyond the light cylinder and back .",

    "the observed luminosity of @xmath129 erg s@xmath30 reflects a small fraction of the inflowing mass that accretes .",
    "the present discussion adds to the possibilities that of occasional rotation powered pulsar activity .",
    "the uncertainty in rotation period and magnetic field does not allow a more detailed discussion in terms of our model .",
    "further , the majority of lmxbs do not exhibit rotation periods in their accretion and propeller phases for reasons of selection in the source , and this is probably also the case for most transients .",
    "neutron stars are born in supernova explosions .",
    "it is a possibility that some of the ejected matter fails to achieve the escape velocity and falls back @xcite .",
    "as the progenitor is rotating , the fallback matter might have enough angular momentum to settle into a disk @xcite .",
    "the idea of fallback disks around pulsars dates back to @xcite .",
    "the fallback disk model @xcite of anomalous x - ray pulsars @xcite renewed interest in possible implications for radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite suggested that the observed jets of crab and vela may be collimated by fallback disks .",
    "young neutron stars might follow a variety of evolutionary paths depending on the initial mass of their fallback disks @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary stages are determined by the mode of interaction discussed in  1 .",
    "as the mass of a fallback disk is not replenished , mass flow rate in the disk declines and the inner radius of the disk , as a consequence , moves out . as the neutron star is initially spinning down with propeller torques",
    ", the light cylinder is also moving out , though less rapidly than the inner radius . at some stage",
    "the inner radius will catch up with the light cylinder .",
    "@xcite and @xcite assumed that the inner radius of fallback disks tracks the light cylinder radius .",
    "in such a model the disk can assist the magnetic dipole radiation torque without quenching the radio pulsar mechanism .",
    "these models would not work @xcite if the disruption of the disk takes place @xcite as soon as its inner edge reaches the light cylinder from within the near zone .",
    "the present work shows that such a disk need not be necessarily disrupted till its inner radius moves to a few times the light cylinder radius . whether the inner radius can actually track the light cylinder for a long epoch , rather than moving beyond the light cylinder into the radiation zone , will be studied in a subsequent paper",
    "we have shown that the electromagnetic energy density of a rotating dipole makes a rather broad transition across the light cylinder from the near zone dipole magnetic field to the radiation zone , the transition being broader for small inclination angles , @xmath36 .",
    "for power - law indices @xmath64 for the @xmath3 dependence of the electromagnetic energy density , @xmath69 , the regime in which the radiation pressure would eject the disk , is not attained until @xmath3 exceeds a few @xmath72 depending on the inclination angle between the spin and magnetic axes ( see eqn .",
    "( [ x52 ] ) and figure  [ gamm52 ] ) .",
    "disks that start their evolution with the inner radius far inside the light cylinder may evolve to the situation where the inner disk radius reaches the light cylinder . in this case and",
    "even further the electromagnetic stresses of the fields generated by the neutron star can balance the material stresses from the disk . near the light cylinder the power - law index of the electromagnetic energy density @xmath130 varies between @xmath131 ( for @xmath132 ) and @xmath133 ( for @xmath134 ) ( see eq .",
    "( [ gamm_l ] ) and fig  [ gamm2_fig ] ) . assuming a thin shakura - sunyaev disk with @xmath135",
    "does not change these conclusions qualitatively and a stable inner radius can be found at least up to @xmath136 times the light cylinder radius for orthogonal rotators while this critical radius inside which stable equilibrium can be found may extend up to a few ten times the light cylinder for small inclination angles .",
    "when the inner radius of the disk is outside the light cylinder , the pulsar activity is likely to turn on.the presence of the disk may effect the coherent radio emission .",
    "the magnetic dipole radiation torque will act on the neutron star even if a radio pulsar is not observed .",
    "sources on their evolutionary path to higher or lower mass inflow rates will make a transition from or to a stage with a disk inner radius stablely placed in the radiation zone , and with possible rotation powered activity .",
    "millisecond x - ray pulsars are likely examples of late stages in the evolution of lmxbs into millisecond radio pulsars through spin - up by accretion @xcite .",
    "such sources might hover around the transition , exhibiting transient behaviour .",
    "the stable presence of the disk outside the light cylinder for a wide range of mass inflow rates makes repeated transitions and sustained transient behaviour possible not only around the transition between propeller and accretion phases , but also around the transition of the inner radius of the disk across the light cylinder .",
