    "this notorious problem @xcite occurs because the ` time ' of gr and the ` time ' of ordinary quantum theory are mutually incompatible notions .",
    "this incompatibility leads to a number of problems with trying to replace these two branches with a single framework in situations in which the premises of both apply , such as in black holes and in the very early universe .",
    "this is investigated in this paper via relational particle models ( rpm s ) @xcite . sec 1.5 explains the nature of these models . for",
    "now , i note that they have a large number of analogies with gr ( see @xcite and especially @xcite ) , rendering them suitable as toy models for many aspects of the problem of time .",
    "one notable facet of the problem of time shows up in attempting canonical quantization of gr ( or of many other gravitational theories that carry over likewise background - independent ) .",
    "it is due to gr s _ hamiltonian constraint _ : = n_^^/ - \\{(x;h ] - 2 } = 0 being quadratic but not linear in the momenta ; i denote the general case of such a constraint by @xmath2uad .",
    "then promoting a constraint with a momentum dependence of this kind to the quantum level gives a time - independent wave equation = 0 [ wde ] , in place of ordinary qm s time - dependent one , i / t = [ or a functional derivative @xmath3 counterpart of this in the general gr case ] .",
    "here , @xmath4 is a hamiltonian , @xmath5 is the wavefunction of the universe and @xmath6 is absolute newtonian time [ or a a local gr - type generalization @xmath7 .    in the case of gr , in more detail , ( [ wde ] ) is a wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation,[multiblock footnote omitted ] : = - \\ { \\ { ^ } - ( h;m]}- ( x;h]+ 2= 0 [ wde3 ] .",
    "this suggests , in apparent contradiction with everyday experience , that nothing at all happens in the universe !",
    "thus one is faced with having to explain the origin of the notions of time in the laws of physics that appear to apply in the universe .",
    "sec 1.3 considers a number of strategies toward explaining this .",
    "[ moreover timeless equations such as the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation apply _ to the universe as a whole _ , whereas the more ordinary laws of physics apply to small subsystems _ within _ the universe , suggesting this to be an apparent ` paradox ' rather than an actual one . ]      over the past decade , it has become more common to suggest or imply that the problem of time _ is _ the frozen formalism problem .",
    "however , a more long - standing point of view @xcite ( and also argued in favour for in e.g. @xcite and the present article ) is that the problem of time contains a number of further facets .",
    "furthermore , this is not even a case of then having to address around eight facets in succession .",
    "for , as kucha found , these facets interfere with each other .",
    "he termed this @xcite a ` many gates ' problem , in which one attempting to enter the gates in sequence finds that they are no longer inside some of the gates they had previously entered .",
    "i argue that this occurs because the facets arise from a common cause ",
    "the mismatch of the notions of time in gr and quantum theory  by which they bear conceptual and technical relations , making it advantageous , and likely necessary for genuine progress , to treat them as a coherent package rather than piecemeal as ` unrelated problems ' . to emphasize this common cause , and place the eight principal facets into a more memorable form",
    "( i have found most theoreticians to be unaware of some facets and/or of their time connotations ) , i used an even more vivid mnemonic @xcite , depicting the eight facets as the breath , wings , tail , scales and four sets of claws that constitute a single entity : the ice dragon .",
    "this depiction makes it clear that the eight facets inter - protect each other ( as kucha observed ) , so that resolving the problem of time is altogether harder than addressing each of the facets in succession , let alone just unfreezing the equations of physics .",
    "apart from the ` frozen breath ' , only the ` wings ' of the problem of observables shall play a recurring theme in the present article .",
    "the frozen formalism facet itself has the following addendum .    *",
    "hilbert space / inner product problem * , i.e. how to turn the space of solutions of the frozen equation in question into a hilbert space . in gr , indefiniteness of the kinetic metric prevents use of a schrdinger inner product and then a klein  gordon",
    "type one fails on other grounds @xcite .",
    "this is a time problem since inner products and unitary evolution are tied .",
    "we next require an interlude so as to interpret further facets .",
    "gr also has a linear _ momentum constraint _ _ : = -2d_^ _ = 0 _ : = -2d_h^/h _ = 0 ; [ 5 ] this often becomes entwined in technical problems that afflict problem of time strategies .",
    "many such entwinings ( see e.g. the next two problems below ) furthermore specifically concern diffeomorphisms [ whether i ) the spatial diffeomorphisms associated with the gr momentum constraint itself , ii ) the spacetime diffeomorphisms or iii ) the result splitting the spacetime diffeomorphisms due to a foliation by spatial hypersurfaces as occurs in canonical approaches to gr ] .",
    "iii ) is altogether harder to handle ; whilst i ) and ii ) are both infinite - dimensional lie groups , in iii ) the gr hamiltonian constraint does not directly account for the diffeomorphisms of ii ) that are not present amongst those of i ) this is reflected e.g. in the dirac algebra of the gr constraints having not the mere structure constants of a lie algebra but , rather , structure functions .",
    "at least this algebra does retain the useful property of closing at the classical level without further constraints appearing .",
    "additionally , in classical gr , one can foliate spacetime in many ways , each corresponding to a different choice of timefunction .",
    "this is how time in classical gr comes to be ` many - fingered ' , with each finger ` pointing orthogonally ' to each foliation .",
    "finally , classical gr has the remarkable property of being foliation - independent @xcite , so that going between two given spatial geometries by means of different foliations in between produces the same region of spacetime , thus giving the same answers to whatever physical questions can be posed therein . equipped with this knowledge , one can return to the discussion of the problem of time .",
    "* best matching problem * : i argued in @xcite that this is a more general conceptualization of , and name for , the usually - listed * sandwich problem*. the context for this is that , if the theory has @xmath8-nontriviality for @xmath8 the group associated with the linear constraints @xmath9 [ generalization of ( [ 5 ] ) ] , then varying with respect to the auxiliary @xmath8-variables produces @xmath10in@xmath11 . the best matching problem is then whether one can solve the lagrangian form of @xmath12 for the @xmath8-auxiliaries themselves , which is a particular form of reduction .",
    "this problem is clearly already present at the classical level .",
    "it furthermore becomes entwined in some of the approaches that start with manipulations at the classical level prior to quantizing .",
    "* foliation dependence problem * : for all that one would like a quantization of gr to retain the nice classical property of refoliation invariance , at the quantum level there ceases to be an established way of guaranteeing this property . that this is",
    "obviously a time problem follows from each foliation by spacelike hypersurfaces being orthogonal to a gr timefunction : each slice corresponds to an instant of time for a cloud of observers distributed over the slice .",
    "each foliation corresponds to such a cloud of observers moving in a particular way .    *",
    "functional evolution problem * alias * possibility of anomalies*. this is the quantum - level problem that the commutator of constraints is capable of manifesting , involving breakdown of the immediate closure of the constraint algebra that occurs at the classical level .",
    "dirac @xcite said that one had to be lucky so as to avoid such breakdowns .",
    "note that only some of the anomalies that one finds in physics are time - related .",
    "however , in the present case of the quantum counterpart of the dirac algebra of gr constraints , this is a time issue due to what these constraints signify .",
    "in particular , non - closure here is a way in which the foliation dependence problem can manifest itself , through the non - closure becoming entwined with details of the foliation .",
    "[ non - closure is also entwined with the operator ordering problem , since changing the operator ordering gives additional right - hand - side pieces not present in the classical poisson brackets algebra . ]    * multiple choice problem * alias * kucha s embarrassment of riches * @xcite .",
    "this is the purely quantum - mechanical problem that different choices of time variable may give inequivalent quantum theories .",
    "[ the ` riches ' are then the multiplicity of such inequivalent quantum theories . ]",
    "foliation dependence is one of the ways in which the multiple choice problem can manifest itself .",
    "moreover , the multiple choice problem is known to occur even in some finite toy models , so that foliation issues are not the only source of the multiple choice problem .",
    "for instance , another way the multiple choice problem can arise is as a subcase of how making different choices of sets of variables to quantize may give inequivalent quantum theories , as follows from e.g. the groenewold ",
    "van hove phenomenon .",
    "* global problem of time * alias * kucha s embarrassment of poverty * @xcite .",
    "this is already present at the classical level .",
    "the spatial part of this problem consists in the separation into true variables and embedding ( space frame and timefunction ) variables having a proneness for being globally impossible , for reasons that closely parallel the gribov effect in yang  mills theory .",
    "this proneness to not globally exist explains kucha s name for this problem .",
    "the temporal part of this problem concerns cases in which such a split can be defined but can not be indefinitely continued as one progresses along a foliation ( or simpler models timefunctions eventually going astray ) .",
    "* spacetime ( reconstruction or replacement ) problem * @xcite . internal space or time",
    "coordinates to be used in the conventional classical spacetime context need to be scalar field functions on the spacetime 4-manifold .",
    "in particular , these do not have any foliation dependence .",
    "however , the canonical approach to gr uses functionals of the canonical variables , and which there is no a priori reason for such to be scalar fields of this type .",
    "thus one is faced with either finding functionals with this property , or coming up with a new means of reducing to the standard spacetime meaning at the classical level .",
    "there are further issues involving properties of spacetime being problematical at the quantum level .",
    "quantum theory implies fluctuations are unavoidable , but now that these amount to fluctuations of 3-geometry , they are too numerous to fit within a single spacetime ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus ( something like ) the superspace picture ( considering the set of possible 3-geometries ) might take over from the spacetime picture at the quantum level .",
    "it is then not clear what becomes of causality ( or of locality , if one believes that the quantum replacement for spacetime is ` foamy ' @xcite ) .",
    "there is also an issue of recovering continuity in suitable limits in approaches that treat space or spacetime as discrete at the most fundamental level ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "* problem of beables*. this is usually called the problem of observables @xcite , but i follow bell @xcite in ascribing more physical significance to beables than to observables , especially in the context of quantum cosmology .",
    "i prefer to use beables , or yet other names corresponding to local versions of such concepts , as per sec 8.2 .",
    "the problem of beables involves construction of a sufficient set of beables for the physics of one s model ; there are then involved in the model s notion of evolution .",
    "the problem of beables was depicted @xcite as the ` wings ' of the ice dragon , due to observables / beables issues popping up all over the place in theoretical physics , much like that the ice dragon suddenly popping up in unexpected places of the realm through having wings to swiftly and unexpectedly fly there ) .",

    "i.e. , it is a perturbative midisuperspace model .",
    "the semiclassical approach involves making ( , ) = ( ) | ( , ) , [ bo ] ( ) = ( i s ( ) ) ; [ wkb ] in each case one makes a number of associated approximations .",
    "[ evoking semiclassicality only makes sense if one s goals are somewhat modest as compared to some more general goals in quantum gravity programs .",

    "\\iv ) one then forms the l - equation @xmath19 .",
    "this is a fluctuation equation but it can be recast ( modulo further approximations ) into a @xmath20-dependent schrdinger equation for the l - degrees of freedom , i|/t^ = _ | [ tdse2 ] .",
    "the emergent time dependent left - hand side of this arises from the cross - term @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the remaining surviving piece of @xmath23 , acting as a hamiltonian for the l - subsystem .",
    "moreover , the working leading to such a time - dependent wave equation ceases to function in the absence of making the wkb ansatz and approximation , which , additionally , in the quantum - cosmological context , is not known to be a particularly strongly supported ansatz and approximation to make .",
    "\\b ) * timelessness*. a number of approaches take timelessness at face value .",
    "one considers only questions of the universe ` being ' , rather than ` becoming ' , a certain state .",
    "b.1 ) a first example is the _ _ .",
    "( this is due to hawking and page @xcite , though its name was coined by unruh and wald @xcite .",
    ") this concerns the ` being ' probabilities for universe properties such as : what is the probability that the universe is large ? flat ?",
    "isotropic ? homogeneous",
    "? one proceeds via considering the probability that the universe belongs to region r of the configuration space that corresponds to a quantification of a particular such property , ( ) _ ||^2 , for @xmath24 the configuration space volume element .",
    "this approach is termed ` nave ' due to it not using any further features of the constraint equations .",
    "its implementation of propositions is boolean via how the region enters the integral .",

    "an example of such a question is ` what is the probability that the universe is flat given that it is isotropic ' ?",
    "this approach can additionally deal with the question of ` being at a time ' by having the conditioning proposition refer to a ` clock ' subsystem .",
    "b.3 ) _ records theory _ involves localized subconfigurations of a single instant of time .",
    "it concerns issues such as whether these contain useable information , are correlated to each other , and whether a semblance of dynamics or history arises from this ( which can involve reducing questions of ` becoming ' to questions of ` being ' ) .",
    "records theory is a heterogeneous subject , a number of different authors advocating different notions of records theory are page @xcite , barbour @xcite and i @xcite ( see also the next ssec ) .",
    "\\c ) * histories theory*. perhaps instead it is the histories that are primary , a view brought to the gr context by gell  mann and , especially , hartle @xcite and subsequently worked on by isham , linden , savvidou and others @xcite .",
    "some motivation for this is as follows .",
    "pro 1 ) both histories and timeless approaches lie on the common ground of atemporal logic structures @xcite .",
    "pro 2 ) there is a records theory within histories theory , as pointed out by gell - mann and hartle @xcite and further worked on by them @xcite , and by halliwell and collaborators @xcite .",
    "thus histories theory supports records theory by providing guidance as to the form a working records theory would take .",
    "this also allows for these two to be jointly cast as a mathematically - coherent package ( as already illustrated in preceding subsections ) . as gell - mann and hartle say @xcite , .",
    "[ situ ] anti 1 ) there is some chance that being more minimalistic than gell - mann  hartle and halliwell could itself succeed .",
    "if one alternatively considers records from first principles from which histories are to be derived , as the history collapses to a single instant , path integrals cease to be defined so this kind of decoherence functional is absent from records theory .",
    "pro 3 ) histories decohereing is a leading ( but as yet _ not fully established _ ) way by which a semiclassical regime s wkb approximation could be legitimately obtained in the first place .",
    "thus histories theory could support the semiclassical approach by freeing it of a major weakness .",
    "pro 4 ) the semiclassical approach and/or histories theory could plausibly support records theory by providing a mechanism for the semblance of dynamics @xcite ( though the possibility of a practically useable such occurring within pure records theory has not been overruled ) .",
    "such would go a long way towards records theory being complete .",
    "that emergent semiclassical time amounts to an approximate semiclassical recovery @xcite of barbour s classical emergent time @xcite , which is an encouraging result as regards making such a semiclassical  timeless records combination .",
    "pro 5 ) the elusive question of which degrees of freedom decohere which should be answerable through where in the universe the information is actually stored , i.e. where the records thus formed are @xcite . in this way , records theory could in turn support histories theory .",
    "pro 6 ) the semiclassical approach aids in the computation of timeless probabilities of histories entering given configuration space regions .",
    "this is by the wkb assumption giving a semiclassical flux into each region @xcite in terms of @xmath31 and the wigner function ( defined in sec 3 ) .",
    "such schemes go beyond the standard semiclassical approach , and as such there may be some chance that further objections to the semiclassical approach ( problems inherited from the wheeler  dewitt equation and spacetime reconstruction problems ) would be absent from the new unified strategy .",
    "pro 7 ) halliwell",
    "s approach has further foundational value for practical quantum cosmology",
    ".    for details of the parts of halliwell s program considered in this paper , see sec 3 .",
    "note 1 ) this program does not make further use of the semiclassical approach s specific unfreezing moves , for all that it does use bo - wkb approximations in obtaining various expressions relevant to the problem of time .",
    "note 2 ) halliwell s approach s attitude to observables / beables is a dirac one ( see sec 2 ) , though he does not for now consider the effect of linear constraints ; the present paper s study is the first to consider examples possessing linear constraints .",
    "rpm s are whole - universe models , toy models of geometrodynamics , with nontrivial constraints and structure formation .",
    "these are suitable for the study of quantum cosmology and some problem of time aspects .",
    "in particular , they are a good arena for histories , records and semiclassical approaches , and quite possibly observables / beables based approaches too ( a point toward which the present paper contributes ) .",
    "rpm s obey the following ` leibniz  mach  barbour ' brand of relationalism ( gr can be cast in a closely parallel form too @xcite ) .",
    "a physical theory is * temporally relational * if there is _ no meaningful primary notion of time for the system as a whole _",
    "( e.g. the universe ) @xcite .",
    "the very cleanest implementation of this is by using actions that are i ) _ manifestly parametrization irrelevant _ , and ii ) _ free of extraneous time - related variables_. [ e.g. one is not to involve external absolute newtonian time , or the dynamical formulation of gr s ` lapse ' variable . ]",

    "one way to implement this is to use not ` bare ' configurations but rather their arbitrary-@xmath8-frame - corrected counterparts .",
    "this is the only known way , with sufficiently widespread applicability for a relational program to underlie the whole of the classical fundamental physics ` status quo ' of gr coupled to the standard model @xcite .",
    "moreover , this paper also covers rpm cases for which configurational relationalism is directly implementable .",
    "the following constraints arise from these relational postulates .",
    "the energy - type constraint : = _ _ ^n p_i^2/2m_i + v(q^i ) = e [ eee ] results from the parametrization - irrelevance of the action .",

    "dil(@xmath0 ) but not rot(@xmath0 ) taken out for rpm s or @xmath135 but not diff(@xmath191 ) taken out for lqg ] . passing to knot equivalence classes of loops is then analogous to the transformations used in @xcite unveil the shape space / relational space variables .",
    "however the transformations in sec 2 and 3 of @xcite for rpm s are purely configuration space manoeuvres , whereas passing to ashtekar variables is itself a canonical transformation .",
    "thus rpm s fit better the philosophy of the central importance of the configuration space @xcite ( as opposed to phase space or of any ` polarizations ' of it that are nt physically configurations ) .",
    "more ambitiously , might one be able to extend halliwell s class operator construction to lqg , so as to be able to , at least formally , write down a ( perhaps partial ) set of complete observables as a subset of the linear constraint complying knots ?",
    "[ i.e. a tentative search for a fully - fledged unicorn .",
    "] this goes beyond the currently - known geometrodynamical minisuperspace scope of halliwell s class operators , but is an interesting direction in which to try to extend this scope ; this discussion is further motivated by how schroeren @xcite has recently considered hartle - type class functions for lqg , and is currently investigating halliwell - type counterparts .",

    "scale dominates shape so as to model the small inhomogeneous fluctuations of the cosmological arena .",
    "there is then a fork as to whether to model this with a notion of environment .",
    "attitude 1 ) on the one hand , the 3-particle rpm has hitherto been taken as a whole - universe model .",
    "this most ideal interpretation is a lot less robust to assuming existence of additional particles whose contributions are then to be traced over ( as compared with minisuperspace modelling having little problem with inclusion of an environment since one assumes there that this model sits in some kind of neglected environment of small inhomogeneous fluctuations ) .",
    "the issue then is justifying the latter parts of @xcite ( or , even more so , the elsewise more correct @xcite ) in the absense of an environment ; this costs us e.g. lines ( [ pipupi]-[whiffle ] ) in the triangleland example .",
    "i note however that in the halliwell 2009 parallel , configuration space regions that are large enough need no environment.c ) are not really any harder to treat than the usual flat space cases . ] as such , our next port of call ( paper ii ) is the rpm counterpart of halliwell 2009 rather than further discussions of environment or its lack in the halliwell 2003 context .",
    "attitude 2 ) alternatively , study scale alone and use shape as an environment .",
    "this suffers from over - simpleness of the original system , but this is alleviated once one considers the shape perturbations about this .",
    "attitude 3 ) study a small set of particles ( say a triangle of particles ) that are taken to dominate over the cloud of other particles , which make small and averaged - out contributions .",
    "these other particles are taken to be negligible in terms of most of their physical effects , but are still permitted to serve as an environment for decoherence and accompanying approximate information storage .",
    "even 1 particle s worth of environment can serve as a nontrivial environment @xcite .",
    "this offers a second resolution to ` losing @xcite s environment ' : arguing that it was hitherto negligible in the study but is nevertheless available at this stage of the study as an environment .",
