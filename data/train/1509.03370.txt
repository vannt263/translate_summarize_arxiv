    "in recent years , synchronization effects of two or more interconnected classical systems have aroused comprehensive attention because synchronization phenomena are found widely in nature . for examples",
    ", huygens found that two clocks with different swings at the initial time will appear synchronization with time evolvement ; it was also observed that the fireflies glow synchronously and the oscillation of heart cells in human or animal will keep in step with each other . at the same time ,",
    "synchronization effects exhibit inimitable application potential in many fields , such as the synchronous transmission of information in the internet , the synchronous transmission and amplification of signals between coupled lasers , the encryption and decryption of signals using chaotic synchronization technology , and so on . to date",
    ", the synchronization of classical system has gradually become the investigation focus in the numerous fields .",
    "the groundbreaking work on theoretical exploration of classical synchronization is marked by yamada and fujisaka who put forward a criterion to judge synchronization behaviors through calculating the lyapunov exponent of the coupling system and obtained synchronization conditions [ 1 ] .",
    "after this , pecora and carroll found synchronization phenomena in the electronic circuit and designed a circuit scheme of encrypted communications using synchronization techniques , which demonstrates the attractive application prospect of synchronization effects and arouses the intense research interest for synchronization theory and application [ 2 ] .",
    "recently , many effective synchronization techniques have been proposed in order to achieve complete or phase synchronization of classical systems [ 3 - 7 ] .",
    "naturally , it is expected to found a similar synchronization phenomenon in quantum systems in order to realize the synchronous transmission of quantum information or states due to its unique advantages of synchronization effects .",
    "however , it is difficult to define precisely some concepts which describe synchronization in quantum systems , like `` tracks '' and  errors \" .",
    "even some concepts used in classical dynamics are completely unsuitable to be used in quantum dynamics because of remarkable differences of two kinds of systems .",
    "therefore , the relative research of quantum synchronization once is thought as unfeasible .",
    "the optomechanical system , as a representative of mesoscopic systems , has attracted widespread attention and systematic discussion recently [ 8 - 11,26 ] .",
    "mesoscopic systems exhibit simultaneously both properties of classical and quantum system under certain conditions because the scale of the system is in - between macro - system and micro - system .",
    "so some phenomena , no matter what chaos behaviors and limit cycle in classical kingdom [ 12 - 14,23 ] or quantum entanglement and quantum coherent in quantum domain [ 15 - 18,23 ] , have been observed in optomechanical systems , which provides reliable basis to expand synchronization theory from classical to quantum . at 2013 ,",
    "mari _ et al .",
    "_ extended the classical synchronization concepts to the quantum system [ 19 ] and developed quantitative theory of synchronization for continuous variable systems evolving in the quantum regime . and in their work ,",
    "two different measures quantifying the level of synchronization of coupled continuous variable are also introduced .",
    "whereafter , some progress has been made in interrelated theories and experiments [ 23 - 25,27 ] .",
    "however in the general case , the synchronization effects are very sensitive to parameters of the systems , such as driving field , coupled intensity , and so on .",
    "therefore , it is expected further to investigate and obtain a quantitative synchronization criterion in order to determine directly whether the synchronization can be realized .",
    "meanwhile , the synchronization criterion can also be regarded as a necessary and sufficient condition of the synchronization effect , which means that the quantum coupling systems can be adjusted and controlled to satisfy the synchronization criterion and to realize the aim of quantum synchronization .",
    "further , the controllability and practicability of quantum synchronization can be improved .    in this work",
    ", we present a general method for discussing synchronization effects in mesoscopic quantum systems .",
    "we introduce the first order and second order measurements to describe the expectation value and the fluctuation of error respectively and give the necessary conditions to estimate the presence of quantum synchronization effects . using this theory",
    ", we design a model based on optomechanical system to realize logic control of quantum synchronization .",
    "subsequently , we validate the criterion through the simulation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec . , the classical synchronization theory is briefly introduced . in sec . , the processing method of quantum mesoscopic synchronization is described and the quantitative criteria for determining quantum complete synchronization and quantum phase synchronization are proposed . in sec . , a controllable quantum synchronization model base on optomechanical system is designed and the phase synchronization effect is discussed . finally , the summary and the prospects are given in sec ..",
    "considering two classical coupled systems @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are state variables of two systems , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are couplings between systems , respectively .",
    "if the error @xmath5 when @xmath6 , the complete synchronization between classical systems is realized . if the phases @xmath7 and @xmath8 of @xmath1 and @xmath2 meet @xmath9 , the phase synchronization between the systems is obtained .",
    "the classical synchronization criteria reported previously are mainly to analyze the stability of the error @xmath10 or phase error @xmath11 and to determine whether @xmath10 or @xmath11 can converge asymptotically to zero through calculating the largest lyapunov exponent . in the next section",
    ", we will propose a criterion for quantum synchronization based on the classical synchronization theory .",
    "in the heisenberg picture , we use quadrature operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 to describe two coupled quantum systems ( here @xmath14 ; @xmath15=i{\\delta}_{jj'}$ ] ) .",
    "hence , the error operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 between the systems can be defined as follows @xmath18/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ p_-(t)&\\equiv [ p_1(t)-p_2(t)]/\\sqrt{2 } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    it can be seen from eq.(2 ) that the error operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 are physical quantities which describe the differences between the conjugate mechanical quantities of two systems .",
    "however , both @xmath16 and @xmath17 can not be very small simultaneously due to the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "therefore , it is required to consider synthetically both values of two error operators in the quantum synchronization measurement . for this reason , mari _ et al . _ introduced the following figure of merit based on eq.(2 ) @xmath19",
    "eq.(3 ) is used to gauge the level of quantum complete synchronization and its value is in the range @xmath20 .    nevertheless , it is also difficult to discuss quantum synchronization by analyzing @xmath21 directly because it is not easy to give a definite criterion for judging the system synchronization or not . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath21 is also complex in quantum systems .",
    "fortunately , the mean value approximation is acceptable in a mesoscopic system , meaning that we can write a mesoscopic system operator @xmath22 in the form of @xmath23 , here @xmath24 is the expectation value of the operator at the moment @xmath25 and it can be regarded as a description of  classical properties \" .",
    "@xmath26 represents the quantum fluctuation of the operator near its expectation value and the quantum effects of the system can be embodied in @xmath26 . for a mesoscopic system ,",
    "@xmath26 is small but can not be ignored .",
    "then , on the basis of eq.(2 ) , the error operators of the systems can be rewritten as follow @xmath27/\\sqrt{2}=\\langle q_-(t)\\rangle+\\delta q_-(t)\\\\ p_-(t)&=[(\\langle p_1(t)\\rangle+\\delta p_1(t))-(\\langle p_2(t)\\rangle+\\delta p_2(t))]/\\sqrt{2}=\\langle p_-(t)\\rangle+\\delta p_-(t ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath28/\\sqrt{2}$ ] and @xmath29/\\sqrt{2}$].as discussed above , the quantum effects of the systems are embodied in @xmath26 .",
    "hence , it is only needed to consider @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the discussion of the synchronization deviation influenced by quantum effects and eq.(3 ) can be rewritten as @xmath32    it should be noted that @xmath33 in eq.(5 ) is a measurement of the error operator s quantum fluctuations near its expectation value .",
    "@xmath33 will equal @xmath21 and it is a synchronization measurement only if @xmath34 and @xmath35 . therefore",
    ", we define @xmath33 as a second order measurement to reflect the differences between systems generated by the quantum noise even though the classical synchronization conditions are reached .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be defined as a first order measurement of quantum synchronization .",
    "now that @xmath36 and @xmath37 satisfy the classical properties , the stability analysis method through calculating the largest lyapunov exponent of the system can be used to determine whether @xmath36 and @xmath37 tend stably to zero .",
    "thus , it is only demanded to control the stability of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , that is , we can control mesoscopic quantum synchronization instead of analyzing @xmath21 directly .",
    "similarly , in the discussion of quantum phase synchronization , the phase error operator can be defined as follow @xmath38/\\sqrt{2}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "we introduce @xmath40 as the measurement of the quantum phase synchronization @xmath41    similar to the discussion of complete quantum synchronization , let @xmath42 and rewrite eq.(7 ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 should be a second order measurement as well under @xmath45 .    in summary , the synchronization effects in mesoscopic quantum systems can be discussed through the following steps : + a. write the operator equations of system s conjugate mechanical quantities in the heisenberg picture , define the error operators and take them as the form of fluctuations near their expectation value , that is , @xmath23 .",
    "+ b. make stability analysis for @xmath46 and calculate the largest lyapunov exponent of the error equations .",
    "if the largest lyapunov exponent is less than zero , the evolution of @xmath46 can tend to zero stably after a certain time , whereas it may be ruleless oscillation .",

    "moreover , we properly reduce the intensity of the driving field in order to highlight the coupling function in synchronization .",
    "otherwise , too strong driving field will dilute the coupling effect , which leads the system in the  forced \" synchronous effect .",

    "have similar ability to control synchronization , we reduce the intensity of phonon channel(@xmath62 ) and increase coupling constant of the fiber . therefore ,",

    "if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are in the blue regions of fig.3(a ) , the largest lyapunov exponent is less than zero , indicating the evolution of the phase error tends to zero stably after a certain time and the systems reach the synchronization .",
    "by contrast , the largest lyapunov exponent is greater than zero while @xmath62 and @xmath63 are in the red regions and the systems are not synchronous because the phase error tends to random oscillations .",
    "therefore , it can be seen from fig.3(a ) that the systems will not synchronize when two systems are not coupled(@xmath110 and @xmath63=0 ) .",
    "once there is coupling between systems , however , the red regions will be replaced gradually by blue area with the increasing of @xmath62 and @xmath63 . we expect to control the synchronization by the switches @xmath49 and @xmath50 together , i.e. it will be happened only if two switches meet the logic  and \"",
    ". then we choose the parameters according to the following principles : the largest lyapunov exponent is greater than zero when @xmath110 and @xmath111 as well as @xmath112 and @xmath113 , but it must be less than zero as @xmath112 and @xmath111 at the same time . according to this ,",
    "the appropriate parameters can be found in @xmath114 $ ] and @xmath115 $ ] recurring to the help of fig.3 and within the range the systems will achieve phase synchronization only if switches @xmath49 and @xmath50 are closed synchronously .",
    "( it is worth to note that alone point with different color from ones around can be ignored as an error . ) in other words , we can control synchronization effect with switches @xmath49 and @xmath50 by using above characteristics .    in the above discussion",
    ", we give a range of parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 but not exact values .",
    "this is because the `` classical '' error can tend to zero for all parameters in that range . whereas for quantum synchronization , not only the expectation value of errors tending to zero is necessary , but also the error fluctuations as small as possible . for the sake of reaching a perfect synchronization , we need to select appropriate values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 and to ensure a minimum quantum fluctuations .",

    "in this calculation , we let @xmath125 and other parameters are same with fig.2 ]    although the phase expectation values of every system tend to be equal , the quantum fluctuations between the systems under different parameters still influence the perfection of quantum phase synchronization , as shown in fig.4 .",
    "the fluctuation of system error will be reduced to minimum extent while taking @xmath126 and @xmath127 , which draws the conclusion that the best effect of synchronization has been reached .",

    ", we notice that two different systems will never achieve phase synchronization in the other parameters ( @xmath100,@xmath60,@xmath65 and @xmath66 ) but the same @xmath61 when couples disappear .",
    "only when two switches are both closed , the systems can realize synchronization , shown as fig.5(d ) .",
