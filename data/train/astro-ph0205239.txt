    "there has been a revolution in recent years in finding and studying star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "an orthogonal approach to studying galaxy assembly is to focus on old stellar populations which formed at even earlier cosmic times .",
    "these old galaxies at intermediate redshift ( @xmath13 ) comprise some of the `` extremely red objects '' , a population with @xmath14mag . here",
    "we present a morphological analysis of one of the oldest galaxies known at high redshift .",
    "the weak 1-mjy radio galaxy lbds53w091 ( 1 ) has a stellar age of @xmath0gyr at @xmath1 , based the amplitude of rest - frame uv spectral breaks seen in keck / lris spectra ( 2,3 ) with a main - sequence turn - off around an f2-f6 star .",
    "if this spectral age - dating is correct , then the galaxy should be a dynamically - evolved elliptical .",
    "ellipticals at the current epoch are remarkably homogeneous , with tight scaling relations - the fundamental plane ( 4,5 ) .",
    "it is important to understand the true nature of this apparently old galaxy in the early universe , and so trace the evolution of these scaling relations .",
    "therefore , we have obtained deep , high - resolution imaging with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in the near - infrared and optical , allowing us to study its morphology and determine the structural parameters .",
    "we observed lbds53w091 with hst over 10 orbits ( 19ksec ) using the near infrared camera / multi - object spectrograph , nicmos ( 6 ) .",
    "we used the diffraction - limited camera nic2 ( 0.076arcsec / pixel and a 19arcsec field ) and the f160w @xmath2-band filter ( 1.6@xmath3 m ) which is a good approximation to the rest - frame @xmath4-band ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "our near - infrared observations were complemented by a 2 orbit ( 5ksec ) wfpc2 image using the f814w `` @xmath15-band '' filter ( 0.8@xmath3 m ) , which at @xmath1 is a good match to the rest - frame f300w filter .",
    "we used `` drizzle '' ( 7 ) to improve the resolution through sub - pixel sampling .",
    "figure  2 shows the registered @xmath15- and @xmath2-band images .",
    "prominent in the near - infrared is a group of extremely red galaxies around the location of the radio source .",
    "a range of two - dimensional models were convolved with the point spread function , then compared against the data to determine the best - fit parameters ( figure  3 ) .",
    "we fit the radial dependence of the surface brightness profile with various functional forms : an @xmath5 bulge ( 8) ; an exponential disk ; a generic srsic @xmath16 profile ( 9 ) ; and a composition of disk and bulge ( 10 ) .",
    "our observations reveal a radial light profile which is well fit by a de vaucouleurs @xmath5 law , with a scale length of @xmath17arcsec ( @xmath18kpc for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the optical @xmath15-band morphology ( sampling the rest - uv and sensitive to younger , bluer stars ) does show some evidence for a disk component , but the near - infrared @xmath2-band light is completely bulge - dominated .",
    "the elliptical morphology of the radio galaxy indicates a dynamically - evolved old system , consistent with the spectroscopic results . down to our detection limits",
    ", we find no evidence for an unresolved central point source ( 11 ) due to agn activity in this weak radio galaxy .",
    "the `` fundamental plane '' ( 4,5 ) provides a tight correlation between the scale length ( @xmath19 ) , surface brightness ( @xmath20 ) and central velocity dispersion ( @xmath21 ) of the form @xmath22 ; the precise physical origin of the fundamental plane is uncertain , but in essence it is a relation between galaxy mass and mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath23 , see 12 ) .",
    "recent work on clusters at moderate redshifts out to @xmath24 has suggested an evolution in the zero - point of the fundamental plane ( 13,14 ) , consistent with passive luminosity evolution of the elliptical stellar population which had formed at much higher redshifts .",
    "it is important to locate high redshift cluster ellipticals , such as those associated with lbds53w091 , on the fundamental plane as the inferred mass - to - light ratios may tell us how close these galaxies are to the formation epoch of ellipticals . in the case of lbds53w091 , no direct measurement of the central velocity dispersions exists - although our nicmos imaging has yielded good determinations of the half - light radius and mean surface brightness .",
    "plotting the edge - on projection of the fundamental plane for coma ( figure 4 ) shows that lbds53w091 is more luminous than the fundamental plane at @xmath25 , correcting only for the @xmath11 surface brightness dimming .",
    "however , if we also correct for passive luminosity evolution from a formation epoch of @xmath12 then this @xmath1 galaxy would lie on the fundamental plane if @xmath26km / s ( comparable with indirect velocity dispersion estimates  see 15 ) .",
    "some surrounding objects lie on the color : magnitude relation for a cluster at @xmath1 , and are likely to be associated .",
    "the tightness of the color : magnitude diagram in clusters could be attributable either to a high formation redshift , or an extremely synchronized , coeval star - formation history of the member galaxies ( 16 ) . the color : magnitude diagram determined at @xmath25 from coma is redder by @xmath27mag than the observed envelope for the field of lbds53w091 ( figure 5 ) . once again , this is entirely consistent with passive luminosity evolution and a high formation redshift .",
