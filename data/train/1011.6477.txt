    "bose - einstein condensation , first predicted in the years 1924 - 25 @xcite , was observed in 1995 on rubidium and sodium vapors @xcite .",
    "these remarkable experiments have generated since then a clear interest in the critical properties of this dilute macroscopic quantum state of matter .",
    "in particular , the transition temperature @xmath1 is a crucial parameter whose exact determination has been a matter of discussion for decades @xcite .",
    "it is indeed rather difficult to estimate the influence of atomic interactions on the condensation temperature for a _ uniform _ dilute weakly interacting bose gas .",
    "this comes from the fact that this is a many - body problem affected by long - range critical fluctuations which have to be described non - perturbatively @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "many different predictions were produced since the late 1950 s , like an increase or even a decrease of @xmath1 proportional to @xmath13 , to @xmath14 , to @xmath15 or even to @xmath16 , where @xmath14 denotes the atomic @xmath17-wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "it is only in 1999 that this question was settled with the rigorous demonstration of the linear increase of the critical temperature with @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it was later shown @xcite that the relative correction @xmath18 behaves at second order as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the condensation temperature of the ideal gas in the thermodynamic limit , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the ( uniform ) atomic density . in this expression , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in a harmonic trap long - range critical fluctuations are suppressed , and the leading ( linear ) order correction to @xmath1 can be calculated by simple perturbative methods @xcite .",
    "using a non - perturbative approach , it was shown in 2001 that in such a potential the relative correction @xmath18 behaves also at second order as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the thermal de broglie wavelength @xcite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "these results were then extended to power - law potentials by zobay _",
    "et al _ in a series of beautiful papers first using mean - field theory @xcite , then using renormalization group theory @xcite , and later on using variational perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "these different theoretical studies helped bridging the gap separating _ homogeneous _ from _ inhomogeneous _ potentials by showing how an increasingly inhomogeneous potential suppresses the influence of critical fluctuations . in these studies , the shape of the potential",
    "could be summarized by a simple parameter @xmath32 which varies between @xmath33 for the uniform gas ( homogeneous case ) and 2 for the ( inhomogeneous ) harmonic trap . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown for instance that critical fluctuations have a marginal impact on the transition temperature when @xmath34 for @xmath35 .    the amplitude of the corrections due to atomic interactions increases of course with the number of particles . on the other side , independently of atomic interactions , with a finite number of particles",
    "the transition temperature is different from the one obtained in the thermodynamic limit . in the case of a harmonic trap ,",
    "this finite size effect results in a downward shift of the transition temperature , which is , at lowest order , linear in the zero point energy of the trapping potential @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tc ]    one can first notice in table [ tab : tc ] that the case @xmath36 is a special case .",
    "indeed , for @xmath36 all finite atom number corrections cancel out in eq .",
    "( [ eq : real ] ) except for the constant term @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath1 is then identical to @xmath20 for all @xmath0 .",
    "this cancellation comes from the fact that incidentally @xmath38 and @xmath39 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : abc ] ) ] .",
    "this is the only value of the shape parameter @xmath32 where there is rigorously no finite atom number correction , whatever the number of trapped atoms .",
    "this special case corresponds for instance to an isotropic cubic trap , with @xmath8 , but also to a trapping potential of cylindrical symmetry such as @xmath40 or to @xmath41 in the case of a cartesian power - law trap .",
    "it also applies for instance to @xmath42 , or to any combination of power - law potentials for which @xmath43 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) ] .",
    "the variation of the relative correction @xmath18 is shown as a function of the shape parameter @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtc - eta ] for @xmath44 ( solid line with black circles ) and @xmath45 ( dashed line with red squares ) .",
    "from the magnified inset of this figure , one can notice again that the point @xmath36 plays a particular role since trapping potentials with @xmath46 are characterized by a decrease of @xmath1 due to finite size effects , while @xmath47 leads , on the contrary , to an increase of @xmath1 .",
    "this could already be inferred from table [ tab : tc ] , where it is seen that the lowest order correction is positive when @xmath47 and negative when @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , one can notice in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtc - eta ] that , even when @xmath48 , the increase in @xmath1 becomes significantly large when @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath50 , an increase of 37% is expected when @xmath51 , and an increase of 84% is expected when @xmath52 .",
    "a large upward shift of @xmath1 can therefore be expected in the case of a generic high - order power - law potential , like @xmath9 with @xmath10 for instance .",
    "one should note here that we have limited our study to @xmath53 , _",
    "i.e. _ to inhomogeneous potentials since a non - perturbative treatment would be necessary for an accurate estimation of @xmath54 in the homogeneous limit @xmath55 .",

    "recently , we have proposed an original route to achieve bose - einstein condensation using dark power - law laser traps @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it has been demonstrated that cold atoms can be trapped and guided in such optical setups @xcite .",
    "these traps are created with two crossing blue - detuned laguerre - gaussian optical beams .",
    "a simple control of their azimuthal order @xmath60 allows for the exploration of a wide range of situations , with atoms trapped in confining power - law potentials in one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "it was shown that , for a fixed atom number , higher transition temperatures are obtained in configurations where @xmath61 , compared to a harmonic trap @xmath62 of the same size .",
    "we investigate here finite size effects in such optical traps .    to create a three - dimensional trap",
    ", we consider an all - optical configuration consisting of two perpendicularly crossing laguerre - gauss laser modes of same radial index @xmath63 and azimuthal index @xmath60 .",
    "the polarizations of the two beams are chosen to be orthogonal to avoid any interference pattern .",
    "the first beam , circularly symmetric , propagates along the @xmath64 direction and provides trapping in the @xmath65 plane . trapping in the third dimension",
    "is provided by another strongly elongated laguerre - gaussian beam shaped elliptically in the form of a light sheet and propagating in the @xmath66 direction .",
    "if the two beams are characterized by the same laser power , waist and detuning , the corresponding potential near the trap center can be described by @xmath67 @xmath68 is then a simple function of the laser power , detuning and waist of the two beams @xcite , and @xmath69 .",

    "[ fig : tc - l ] shows the variation of the condensation temperature with the shape parameter @xmath32 and the azimuthal index @xmath60 .",
    "the temperature @xmath20 obtained in the thermodynamic limit is shown as a thick green solid line .",
    "it is identical for all atom numbers @xmath0 since we have chosen the volume of the trap such that the condensation temperature obtained in the thermodynamic limit is the same for all atom numbers ( 100nk with @xmath75 , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "as already discussed in @xcite , the temperature @xmath20 increases with @xmath60 since @xmath82 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc0 ] ) ] . in the same figure ,",
    "the condensation temperature @xmath1 taking into account finite size effects is shown as a dashed black line with circles for @xmath72 , a red dashed line with squares for @xmath83 and a blue dashed line with triangles for @xmath84 .",
    "compared to a harmonic trap of the same size , it can be concluded that much higher critical temperatures can be obtained in a power - law trap , and this especially for small condensation occupation numbers .",
    "this large increase results from the combination of two positive effects : first the effect of the potential shape on the temperature @xmath20 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc0 ] ) ] and second the finite size effect [ eq .",

    "[ fig : tc - l ] , compared to @xmath85nk in the harmonic case ( @xmath75 ) , the condensation temperature for @xmath77 is about 283nk , 251nk and 212nk for @xmath78 , @xmath11 and @xmath79 , respectively.this corresponds to an increase of @xmath1 by about 183% , 151% and 112% , respectively , when compared to the transition temperature found in a harmonic trap .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a detailed theoretical analysis of finite size effects on the transition temperature @xmath1 of an ideal bose gas trapped in an inhomogeneous generic three - dimensional power - law potential . using the local density approximation ,",
    "we have derived an analytical expression of @xmath1 , expressed in terms of a power series in @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the zero - point energy of the trapping potential .",
    "we have also given numerical expressions truncated at second order for a specific set of power - law potentials .",
    "more precisely , we have shown that in the case of a harmonic trap the usual lowest - order correction is inaccurate when the number particles @xmath0 is less than @xmath86 . in this case",
    ", the next order has also to be taken into account , yielding to the relative correction @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 denote the arithmetic and geometric means of the harmonic oscillator frequencies .    beyond the specific case of the harmonic potential , we have also shown that , if the atoms are trapped in a power - law potential characterized by a shape parameter @xmath36 , all finite size effects cancel out , and the critical temperature is simply equal to the one obtained in the thermodynamic limit , independently of the number of particles . in the case of a trap of cylindrical symmetry , this happens for example for @xmath40 , but also for @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , we have shown that in a power - law potential characterized by a shape parameter @xmath91 , the temperature shift due to finite size effects becomes positive .",
    "this shift may be relatively large for @xmath76 with relatively small atom numbers ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the magnitude of this phenomenon was finally confirmed in the specific case of rubidium atoms confined by blue - detuned laguerre - gauss optical laser beams .",
    "finally , one should note that even though our approach gives the exact result for all types of power - law potentials within the limits imposed by the approximations used in our theoretical model , it is not able to capture the essence of critical phenomena taking place in a purely homogeneous system , due to the importance of long - range non - perturbative critical fluctuations in such systems .    the institut des sciences molculaires dorsay ( ismo ) is unit mixte de recherche de luniversit paris - sud 11 et du cnrs ( umr 8214 ) . the authors would like to acknowledge financial support from agence nationale de la recherche ( projects imagefemto no .",
