    "within the framework of hierarchical formation , dwarf ( @xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 ) galaxies are the first systems to collapse and start forming stars , supplying the building blocks for the formation of more massive galaxies through merging and accretion . as remnants of this process , present - day dwarfs may have been sites of the earliest star - formation ( sf ) activity in the universe .",
    "however , the most metal - poor ( @xmath8 , corresponding to @xmath9 @xmath5 1/20 z@xmath7 ) dwarf irregular ( dirr ) and blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies have been repeatedly pointed out as good candidate `` primeval '' galaxies in the nearby universe , with possible ages less than 100 - 500 myr ( e.g. , izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "if some of these objects turn out to be young galaxies , their existence would support the view that sf in low - mass systems has been inhibited until the present epoch ( e.g. , babul & rees 1992 ) .",
    "the discovery of a nearby primordial galaxy would thus have revolutionary cosmological implications . on the other hand",
    ", the lack of such systems would provide strong constraints on the chemical and physical evolution of low - metallicity dirr / bcds .",
    "the only direct way to unambiguously infer the evolutionary status of a metal - poor dirr / bcd galaxy is to resolve it into stars with deep hst observations , and study stellar features in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "the brightest of these features that contains stars of significant age is the red giant branch ( rgb ) , formed by low - mass stars with ages @xmath10 - 13 gyr that are burning h in a shell around a he core . in the last 15 years",
    "all metal - poor dirr galaxies in the local group and bcds with @xmath11 mpc have been imaged with hst .",
    "interestingly , an rgb has been detected in all those galaxies for which photometric data exist that go deep enough to reach the rgb tip ( trgb , brightest phase of the rgb ) in the cmd ( e.g. , sbs  1415 + 437 , aloisi et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein).=-2    the only possible exception so far is the bcd i  zw  18 . with an oxygen abundance @xmath12 ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath13 z@xmath7 , i  zw  18 is the `` prototype '' member of its class , and the most metal - poor galaxy in the nearby universe .",
    "many hst studies have focused on the evolutionary status of i  zw  18 .",
    "after other groups had already resolved the brightest individual stars in the galaxy , our group was the first to go deep enough to detect asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in hst / wfpc2 images with ages of at least several hundreds myr and possibly up to a few gyrs ( aloisi et al .",
    "these results were confirmed by stlin ( 2000 ) through deep hst / nicmos imaging .",
    "more recently , izotov & thuan ( 2004 ) presented new deep hst / acs observations .",
    "their @xmath14 vs.  @xmath15 cmd shows no sign of an rgb , from which they concluded that the most evolved ( agb ) stars are not older than 500 myr and that i  zw  18 is a bona fide young galaxy .",
    "this result was subsequently challenged by momany et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and our group ( tosi et al .",
    "2006 ) based on a better photometric analysis of the same data .",
    "this showed that many red sources do exist at the expected position of an rgb , and that their density in the cmd drops exactly where a trgb would be expected .",
    "however , the small number statistics , the large photometric errors , and the incompleteness at the trgb , did not allow a conclusive statement about the possible existence of an rgb in i  zw  18",
    "we were awarded 24 additional orbits with acs over a three - month period starting in october 2005 ( go program 10586 , pi aloisi ) to better understand the evolutionary status of i  zw  18 .",
    "the observations were obtained in 12 different epochs in f606w and f814w to : ( 1 ) build a deeper cmd to search for rgb stars ; ( 2 ) detect and characterize cepheids at the lowest metallicity available in the local universe ; and ( 3 ) use both the cepheids and a possible trgb detection to determine an accurate distance to i  zw  18 . in this paper",
    "we will present the preliminary results from the new deep photometry .",

    "after application of cte and aperture corrections , the count rates were transformed to johnson - cousins @xmath16 and @xmath14 magnitudes .",
    "values shown and discussed hereafter are corrected for @xmath17 mag of galactic foreground extinction , but not for any extinction intrinsic to i  zw  18 .",
    "the archival acs data in f555w and f814w ( go program 9400 , pi thuan ) were also re - processed in a similar manner .",
    "the two acs datasets were then combined using several different approaches and rejection schemes .",
    "the results discussed here were obtained by demanding that stars should be detected in all the four deep images ( @xmath16 and @xmath14 for both datasets ) . at the expense of some depth , this approach has the advantage of minimizing the number of false detections and therefore providing relatively `` clean '' cmds .",

    "this agreement further supports our interpretation of the lf drop in figure  2 as a trgb feature.=-2    the evidence for an rgb in i  zw  18 is further strengthened by comparison to another bcd , sbs  1415 + 437 , observed by us with a similar hst / acs set - up ( aloisi et al .",
    "this galaxy is not quite as metal poor as i  zw  18 ( @xmath28 ) and is somewhat nearer at @xmath29 mpc . but",
    "taking into account the differences in distance and completeness , the cmds of these galaxies look very similar .",
    "since sbs 1415 + 437 has an unmistakable rgb sequence , this suggests that such an rgb sequence exists in i  zw  18 as well .",
    "it has previously been suggested that i  zw  18 has no stars with ages @xmath30 myr .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask the question whether there exist star formation histories ( sfhs ) which do not have stars older than @xmath10 gyr ( and by extension , do not have an rgb ) , yet which can still fit : ( 1 ) the observed number of faint red stars in i  zw  18 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) ; and ( 2 ) the observed lf drop - off at @xmath33 .",
    "preliminary results of sfh modeling that we have performed indicate that such sfhs do not exist .",
    "we have obtained new deep hst / acs observations of i  zw  18 that provide improved insight into the evolutionary status of this benchmark metal - poor bcd .",
    "our results indicate that this galaxy contains rgb stars , in agreement with findings for other local metal - poor bcds studied with hst . underlying old ( @xmath1 gyr ) populations are therefore present in even the most metal - poor systems , so they must have started forming stars at @xmath2 .",
    "deeper studies ( well below the trgb ) will be needed to pinpoint the exact onset of star formation in these galaxies .",
    "we find that at @xmath3 mpc , i  zw  18 is more distant than the values @xmath34 mpc that have often been assumed in previous work .",
    "this may explain why it has remained difficult for so long to unambiguously detect or rule out the presence of old resolved ( rgb ) stars in this object .",
    "the data that we are compiling on cepheid stars in i  zw  18 will be unique for probing the properties of variable stars at metallicities that have never before been probed ."
