    "the alloy theoretic automated toolkit ( atat ) avdw : atat , avdw : maps , avdw : emc2 is a suite of software tools facilitating the determination of thermodynamic properties of solid state alloys from first - principles calculations .",
    "it relies upon the cluster expansion formalism sanchez : cexp , ducastelle : book , fontaine : clusapp , zunger : nato , zunger : scord , wolverton : srorev , ceder : oxides , asta : fppheq to build a simplified effective hamiltonian that accurately reproduces quantum mechanical calculation results for an alloy system of interest and that can be used to efficiently calculate their thermodynamic properties .",
    "atat is freely distributed and open - source , thus encouraging users to contribute @xcite .",
    "atat s basic functionalities have been described in an earlier issue of the calphad journal @xcite . since then , a number of new features have been added and the purpose of the present paper is to describe these additions and provide a concise user guide  for these new features .",
    "the most significant additions to atat are    1 .",
    "extensions to multicomponent multisublattice systems ; 2 .   the inclusion of nonconfigurational sources of entropy ( vibrational and electronic entropy ) ; 3",
    ".   special quasirandom structures ( sqs ) generation ; 4 .   tensorial cluster expansion construction ; 5",
    ".   support for multiple atomistic ( ab initio ) codes ; 6 .",
    "various new conversion and analysis utilities .",
    "the features presented here are not exhaustive and new features are continuously being added .",
    "hence , the reader is invited to consult the manual supplied with the atat distribution or posted on the atat web site ( ` http://alum.mit.edu/www/avdw/atat ` ) for the most up to date information .",
    "the traditional _ cluster expansion _ represents the relationship @xmath0 between a _ configuration _ @xmath1  and some scalar intensive quantity @xmath2 . while multicomponent alloys have been covered since the original introduction of the cluster expansion @xcite , handling multisublattice systems ( in which different sites in the unit cell can host different binary sets of atoms ) is a more recent extension @xcite . atat implements a superset of these two formalisms , allowing different sites to host an arbitrary ( and potentially different ) number of elements , some of which may be common across sublattices .",
    "these sublattices may or may not consist of sets of symmetrically equivalent sites .  to fix the ideas , refer to table [ tablat ] for an example exploiting all of these extensions .",
    "the multicomponent multisublattice features of atat have been used , for instance , in avdw : smceo2,ghosh : alznti , shin : ternsqs .",
    ".[tablat ] example of a lattice , based on the martensite system , written in atat s `` lattice input file '' format .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]    + this way of specifying composition was selected because it allows the user to individually control the composition on each sublattice .",
    "3 .   select a small number of correlations to match exactly and compute their value in the disordered state:`corrdump -noe -rnd -s = conc.in -2=[pair max radius ] 3=[triplet max radius ] > tcorr.out`this command writes the nonempty ( ` -noe ` ) correlations of the disordered state ( ` -rnd ` ) having the same composition as the structure ` conc.in ` into the file ` tcorr.out `",
    ". pair correlations up to distance ` [ pair max radius ] ` and triplet correlations up to ` [ pair triplet radius ] ` are considered ( larger clusters can also be specified with ` -4=  ` , etc . ) .",
    "this command also writes a cluster file ` clusters.out ` that will be read in the step .",
    "the sqs generation step is initiated with , for instance,`gensqs -n=16 >",
    "sqs16.out`which generates 16-atom sqs and puts them into the ` sqs16.out ` file .",
    "if this file is empty , the range of correlations to be matched exactly needs to be reduced in step 3 . a word of caution : ` gensqs ` only generates structures containing exactly the number of atoms per unit cell specified by the ` -n ` option ( i.e. , if an sqs with a smaller unit cell exists , it will not be listed ) .",
    "the output file ` sqs16.out ` may contain a large number of candidate sqs .",
    "while these a match the specified criteria , they may differ in quality in terms of the correlations not included in the screening process .",
    "further screening can be performed with the command`corrdump -2=[another radius ] -3=[another radius ] -4=[another radius ] -noe -s = sqs16.out`which will output the correlations of all sqs in ` sqs16.out ` . clearly , the radii specified should be larger than in step 3 in order to distinguish and rank these sqs .",
    "while there are no formal rules to decide whether it is preferable to match more pairs or more multi - body correlations , general guidelines can be given . in general , it would be unusual to match longer range @xmath3-body correlations than @xmath4-body interactions if @xmath5 . in systems exhibiting large relaxations ( due to large atomic size mismatches ) , multi - body correlations are expected be important , while in ionic systems , pair interactions are expected to dominate .",
    "sqs generation via exhaustive enumeration is time - consuming .",
    "this can be alleviated by exploiting parallelism .",
    "multiple independent copies of ` gensqs ` can be run on separate processors if one specifies the ` -ip=[index ] ` and ` -tp=[number of processes ] ` options .",
    "the ` [ index ] ` runs from 0 to ` [ number of processes-1 ] ` and is used to tell each copy of ` gensqs ` which portion of the space to scan . for maximum efficiency , ` [ number of processes ] ` should be a factor of the total number of possible supercells , which can be determined , e.g. , with the ` gensqs -n=16 -pc ` command .    another way to improve sqs generation speed is via stochastic sampling abrikosov : sqsmc .",
    "such an approach seeks to quickly find close - to - optimal solutions rather than slowly finding an exact solution .",
    "another approach is to scan through configurations in such as way that only the desired composition is sampled , using atom permutations rather than atom transmutations .",
    "this scheme becomes increasingly advantageous as one moves away from equiatomic compositions .",
    "yi wang contributed a useful code implementing these two algorithms ( that were used in @xcite ) , which will be included in the atat distibution shortly .",
    "finally , we note that sqs prove useful in the construction of a cluster expansion as well .",
    "any generated sqs can be included into the set structures used to fit a cluster expansion as a way to ensure that the properties of the disordered state are properly reproduced . in practice",
    ", one can merely place the desired sqs into a ` str.out ` file within a subdirectory and run an ab initio code on it with ` runstruct_xxxx ` .",
    "the ` mmaps ` code will readily read in any user - specified structure placed in its directory hierarchy ( provided the ` lat.in ` files used in ` mmaps ` and ` gensqs ` are identical ) .",
    "while the formalism enabling the cluster expansion of tensors has been derived in @xcite , we provide here a brief explanation of how to use this feature . in section [ seccenc ] , it was shown how to cluster expand a scalar  the process is similar for tensors .    1 .",
    "create a ` lat.in ` providing the lattice and a ` gcetensor.in ` file describing the type of tensor in the form:`[rank]``[list of pairs of indices indicating which simultaneous index permutations leave the tensor invariant]``[next list , etc ... ]`to fix the ideas , here are a few examples . for strain or stress the ` gcetensor.in ` should be:`2``0 1 ` ( indicating that such tensor is symmetric , i.e. ,  @xmath6)while for elastic constants , it should be : ` 4 ` ` 0 1 ` ( indicating @xmath7 ) ` 2 3 ` ( indicating @xmath8 ) ` 0 2 1 3 ` ( indicating @xmath9 ) .",
    "2 .   generate a list of clusters with the command`gce -clus -2=[max pair radius ] -3=[max triplet radius ] ` etc.note that ` gce ` ( which stands for generalized cluster expansion ) admits essentially the same syntax as ` corrdump ` in the scalar case .",
    "3 .   calculate the property tensor associated with each structure .",
    "this is highly application - dependent .",
    "for instance , to calculate the static lattice strain , one could use ( assuming ab initio calculations have been run in each subdirectory):`foreachfile -e str_relax.out analrelax -d > strain`to calculate the elastic constants one could use:`foreachfile -e str_relax.out calcelas -d ` ( this generates perturbations)`pollmach -e runstruct_xxxx -w force.wrap ` ( this calculates the induced reaction stresses)`foreachfile -e str_relax.out calcelas -f > elas ` ( this fits the elastic tensor and writes it in the file ` elas ` . ) 4 .   finally , do the cluster expansion itself with:`clusterexpand -pa -g",
    "strain``clusterexpand -pa -g elas`the ` -g ` invokes the generalized cluster expansion option while the ` -pa ` indicates that the quantities to be expanded are intensive ( i.e. per atom ) .",
    "all interfaces have the general name ` runstruct_xxxx ` .",
    "currently , the following are supported : ` runstruct_vasp ` ( for the vasp code @xcite ) ` runstruct_abinit ` ( for the abinit @xcite  code ) , ` runstruct_gulp ` ( for the gulp code @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , monodeep chakraborty , jrgen spitaler , peter puschnig and claudia ambrosch - draxl have written an interface with ` wien2k ` @xcite , which will be publicly available shortly . finally , ` runstruct_pwscf ` ( for the pwscf code @xcite ) is under development .",
    "each interface  has the following characteristics in common :    1 .",
    "it reads the geometry of a structure from the ` str.out ` file in current directory , written in the atat format .",
    "if a ` str_hint.out ` file exists , it takes precedence over the ` str.out ` file .",
    "this is useful to provide educated  guesses of the relaxed geometry via external user - supplied codes .",
    "2 .   it reads some code - specific parameters from a file called ` xxxx.wrap ` ( or specified with ` -w [ file ] ` ) located in the current directory or up to two levels above .",
    "this separation between the geometry and calculation parameter input files is essential to ensure that all the pieces of atat are fully interoperable .",
    "3 .   it runs the appropriate ab initio or atomistic code . if an argument is given to the ` runstruct_xxxx ` this string is used as prefix to the ab initio command .",
    "this feature is used to run the appropriate code remotely without having to install atat on the compute nodes .",
    "4 .   it writes the structure s energy in the file ` energy ` and the structure s relaxed geometry in ` str_relax.out ` .",
    "( if no relaxations are allowed , then the unrelaxed geometry is written in ` str_relax.out ` . )",
    "it writes the forces acting on all atoms in ` forces.out ` , the stress acting on the cell in ` stress.out ` and the electronic density of states in ` dos.out ` ( although these are not yet implemented in all ` runstruct_xxxx ` commands ) .",
    "if anything goes wrong with the calculations , a file called ` error ` is written .",
    "typically the ab initio codes are not called one run at the time but rather as a batch of many jobs .",
    "the ` pollmach ` command manages such pools of jobs .",
    "the basic principle is simple : if a file called ` wait ` exists in a subdirectory , ` pollmach ` will find it and run the command specified on the command line within that directory .",
    "for instance,`pollmach runstruct_xxxx`will repeatedly wait for a ` wait ` file to be found , delete it , and then run ` runstruct_xxxx ` with the corresponding directory . in a multiprocessor environment , ` pollmach ` can simultaneously dispatch different jobs to different processors .",
    "this simple mechanism allows most of the atat codes to be completely platform - independent , with ` pollmach ` being the only platform - dependent piece .",
    "the first time ` pollmach ` is run , default configurational files are set up and the user will be asked to tailor them to the local computing environment .",
    "the atat distribution includes many examples of setups , including the increasingly common case of a large pool of processors to be divided up into subgroup that each run a separate parallel version of an ab initio code .",
    "we now briefly mention some utilities to give users direct access to some of the inner algorithms of atat .    1 .   `",
    "corrdump ` finds symmetry operations , enumerates clusters , calculates correlations ( including of the disordered state ) , etc .",
    "genstr ` enumerates superstructures of a given lattice .",
    "pdef ` generates substitutional point defect supercells .",
    "cellcvrt ` manipulates atat - formatted structure files , changing coordinate systems , converting fractional to cartesian coordinates , finding supercells and subcells , etc .",
    "lsfit ` implements least - squares fitting .",
    "nnshell ` finds nearest - neighbor shells .",
    "a number of text parsing utilities : ` getvalue ` , ` getlines ` , ` sspp ` .",
    "more information regarding these utilities can be found in their respective help files ( accessed by specifying the ` -h ` option ) .",
    "this completes this overview of the various new features added to atat in recent years .",
    "what s next ? probably :    1 .   a tighter integration between the output of the monte carlo code and thermodynamic databases for use with softwares such as thermocalc and pandat ; 2 .   material propery optimization modules exploiting the tensorial cluster expansion ; 3 .",
    "more automated ways to include nonconfigurational free energy ; 4 .   better electronic free energy calculators",
    ".    however , in large part , what will be next will depend on what users express interest in and what the author can get funding for ",
