    "the origin of singularities in thermodynamic functions which characterize infinite systems undergoing phase transitions is a central issue in statistical mechanics . a possible approach deals with the distribution of zeroes of the partition sum in the complex temperature plane  @xcite .",

    "a convex intruder in the microcanonical entropy , leading to a backbending in the functional relationship between temperature and energy ( caloric curve ) has been proposed as a general definition of first order phase transitions in finite systems  @xcite .",
    "indeed negative heat capacities have been observed and connected to first order phase transitions in different models  @xcite and even experimentally measured  @xcite .    in this context",
    "the ising model with fixed magnetization ( imfm ) presents some very peculiar features . for small systems the microcanonical caloric curve which relates energy to temperature",
    "does not show any backbending in the temperature domain where a first order phase transition exists in the ising model  @xcite .",
    "this finding shows that backbendings are deeply connected to the constraints which are imposed on the system  @xcite and their presence may depend on the physical quantities which are used in order to define the considered statistical ensemble as it will be shown later .",
    "it is well known that imfm is isomorphous to an isochore lattice gas model .",
    "if we consider that no divergence is expected for the heat capacity at constant volume in the macroscopic liquid to gas phase transition , the absence of a backbending in the microcanonical caloric curve illustrates the fact that there may be no one to one correspondence between first order phase transitions and convexity anomalies of the microcanonical entropy as a function of energy .",

    "moreover , recent analytic arguments  @xcite lead to the conclusion that the transition is continuous in the thermodynamic limit . the cluster properties of small imfm lattices also show different signs of critical behavior  @xcite . together with the information coming from the caloric curve",
    ", this could suggest that the apparent order of the transition in the imfm model changes with the size of the system .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall try to clarify these issues by using a definition of phase transitions based on the occurrence of bimodalities in the probability distribution of an observable  @xcite .",
    "this definition is a generalization of the one based on curvature anomalies and satisfies the yang lee unit circle theorem in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "since , in gibbs equilibria , a bimodal distribution of an observable is connected to the backbending of the associated equation of state in the ensemble where the observable is constrained by a conservation law , this study will allow us to elucidate the relationship between backbendings , constraints , and the order of the transition .",
    "we shall first analyze the topology of the events in the ising model ( section  [ sec2 ] ) to show that many properties of imfm can be understood starting from the standard ising model .",
    "we shall see that backbendings are not characteristic of the caloric curve only but can appear in other equations of state and closely depend on the constraints applied to the system , i.e. on the statistical ensemble in which the system is studied . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we shall consider the behavior of the imfm and we shall see that for all sizes the transition can be unambiguously recognized as a first order transition even if a backbending appears in the microcanonical caloric curve only for large sizes and may disappear at the thermodynamic limit . concerning this limit",

    "will be given in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "we shall first concentrate on the well known ising model to show that the topological properties of observable distributions  @xcite allow to reconstruct the thermodynamics of the model and at the same time to get some hint about the behavior of the imfm model .",
    "the order parameter of the standard ising model is the magnetization @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and the sum extends to the @xmath2 sites of a lattice .",
    "it is interesting to note that because of the mapping between the ising model and the lattice gas model @xmath3 , a spin up @xmath4 can also been interpreted as an occupied site @xmath5 then the magnetization is mapped into the order parameter for the lattice gas model which is nothing but the number of particles @xmath6 . since the volume is fixed , @xmath7 indeed corresponds to the density @xmath8 , the known order parameter of the liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "we shall also use the average magnetization per site @xmath9 which is then isomorphous to a particle density via @xmath10 . in the ising model",
    "neighboring sites interact via a constant attractive coupling @xmath11 . in our numerical implementations of the model",
    "we have considered three dimensional cubic lattices characterized by a linear dimension @xmath12 with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "@xcite .    below the critical temperature",
    "@xmath13 the ising model shows a first order phase transition at zero field @xmath14 which is characterized , in infinite systems , by a discontinuity of the magnetization when the field changes sign .",
    "this jump is clearly visible in the standard average magnetization versus field equation of state already for a lattice as small as @xmath15 as shown in the right part of fig .",
    "it is important to notice that for a finite system the magnetization is an observable which does not take a unique value but fluctuates from event to event so that the constant field statistical ensemble corresponds to a whole magnetization distribution .",
    "this distribution is shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for three different values of the applied external field . for sufficiently large fields",
    "@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) the system gets a negative ( positive ) magnetization peak .",
    "the transition from the dominantly negative to the dominantly positive solution passes through a bimodality of the magnetization distribution which can be taken as a definition of phase coexistence , the two peaks being associated to the two phases  @xcite .",
    "the transition field is the one for which the two peaks have the same height so that the most probable magnetization jumps from negative to positive values . for symmetry reasons this of course",

    "it is important to notice that a bimodality in the distribution of an observable ( here the magnetization ) implies a backbending for the associated equation of state in the statistical ensemble where this observable is controlled on an event by event basis . indeed",
    "the magnetization distribution of the ising model in the presence of a fixed magnetic field at a temperature @xmath18 reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of configurations or microstates with energy @xmath21 and magnetization @xmath22 , and the relation between the partition sum of ising with a magnetic field @xmath23 and at fixed magnetization @xmath24 is @xmath25 equation  ( [ p_ising ] ) shows that the magnetization distribution @xmath26 in standard ising can be directly related to the partition sum of the imfm .",
    "the thermodynamic relations for the imfm can thus at least in principle be calculated from @xmath26 without a direct simulation of the imfm .",
    "in particular the equation of state related to the magnetization in the imfm reads @xmath27 equation  ( [ eos ] ) shows that a bimodality in @xmath26 implies a backbending of the intensive parameter @xmath28 ( which has the dimension of a magnetic field ) associated with the magnetization as shown on the r.h.s . of fig .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath28 is not a mathematical artifact but represents the physical magnetic field which , applied to ising , gives @xmath22 as the most probable response . indeed in the presence of an external field @xmath29",

    "this discussion can be immediately extended to any generic gibbs equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "a phase coexistence ( first order phase transition ) is signalled by a bimodality in the probability distribution of an extensive variable which can then be identified as an order parameter .",
    "this topological anomaly is equivalent to a convexity anomaly in the thermodynamic potential of the ensemble in which the order parameter is constrained by a conservation law ( extensive ensemble ) , and reflects in a backbending of the associated intensive variable in this extensive ensemble .",
    "a backbending in the order parameter equation of state is an alternative possible definition of a first order phase transition in an extensive ensemble of a finite system  @xcite .",
    "this observation has a very important consequence .",
    "the two definitions of first order phase transitions in finite systems ( bimodalities and backbendings ) are strictly equivalent  @xcite .",
    "the observation of a bimodal probability distribution in an ensemble where the order parameter is not strictly fixed allows then to conclude about the order of the phase transition in the corresponding extensive ensemble without explicitly observing or simulating it .",
    "in particular the bimodality of the magnetization distribution observed for the standard ising model with no constraints on the magnetization ( @xmath14 ) at subcritical temperatures ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) implies that the magnetic susceptibility of imfm is negative for magnetization domains lying between the two dominant peaks of ising .",
    "this negative susceptibility , analogously to a negative heat capacity in a microcanonical ensemble , indicates a first order phase transition .",
    "the connection between the bimodality of the magnetization distribution and a negative susceptibility is valid for all finite sizes up to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , the well known fact that the ising bimodality converges to a finite jump in the thermodynamic limit guarantees that the corresponding phase transition in imfm is also first order up to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this situation is analogous to the relationship between the grancanonical and the canonical ensemble discussed in the context of the yang - lee theorems  @xcite . indeed because of the exact mapping between ising and lattice gas the magnetization can be viewed as a particle density and @xmath35 times the magnetic field is isomorphous to the logarithm of a fugacity . using the fact that the equation of state at the thermodynamic limit is the limiting curve of an analytical function",
    ", the equivalence between ensembles can be demonstrated for short range interactions even in the coexistence region of first order phase transitions  @xcite .    in the recent literature of phase transitions in finite systems  @xcite backbendings",
    "have been often observed in the microcanonical caloric curve , leading to negative heat capacity . following the general relationship between ensembles discussed above",
    ", a negative heat capacity univocally implies a bimodal energy distribution in the corresponding canonical ensemble .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that because of the symmetry between spins up and down in the ising hamiltonian , the two magnetization solutions correspond to the same energy .",
    "this means that the energy can not be used as an order parameter for this model . on the other hand ,",
    "all variables correlated to the magnetization can present a bimodality , i.e. can be considered as order parameters . as an example ,",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] show the correlation between the magnetization and the size of the largest connected domain @xmath36 , here defined with the coniglio - klein algorithm  @xcite in its simplified version proposed by x. campi and h. krivine  @xcite .",
    "these figures also illustrate the fact that a first order phase transition in a finite system can be seen as a bifurcation in the observable plane defined by the control variable ( here the temperature ) and ( one of ) the order parameter(s ) .",
    "in the previous section we have recalled that an order parameter of a first order phase transition can be defined as any observable @xmath37 which allows to separate the two phases , i.e. such that if events are sorted as a function of @xmath37 , they split into two components separated by a minimum of the distribution function .",
    "this definition is valid only if the order parameter is free to fluctuate .",
    "if the order parameter is constrained by a conservation law , the first order character of the transition can still be recognized from the backbending of the equation of state relating the order parameter to its conjugated intensive variable .",
    "for example , a first order phase transition in a microcanonical model is signalled by a backbending in the caloric curve .",
    "some models have been reported where the kinetic energy plays the role of an additional order parameter and shows a bimodal distribution in the microcanonical ensemble  @xcite but in the general case bimodalities have not to be expected if the order parameter is fixed by a conservation law . in the same way since the magnetization is the same for all events in the imfm model , the ising bimodality at zero field observed in the previous section can not subsist any more in imfm .",
    "however in the case of finite systems fluctuations are not negligible and the relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath36 is not a one to one correspondence but rather a loose correlation .",
    "this implies that for finite systems a bimodality in the @xmath36 distribution can remain even in the constant magnetization ensemble .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which displays the @xmath36 distribution for the imfm with a number @xmath38 of positive spins ( or lattice gas particles ) in a @xmath39 cubic lattice ( corresponding to a magnetization @xmath40 and a low density @xmath41 ) at a temperature @xmath42 where @xmath43 corresponds to the transition temperature , i.e. the temperature at which the two maxima of the energy distribution have the same height . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( left ) , @xmath36 is correlated with the energy @xmath21 , so that the bimodality in @xmath36 reflects in a bimodality in the energy distribution .",
    "the bimodality in the energy distribution implies that the microcanonical imfm caloric curve presents a backbending .",
    "we have just interpreted this backbending as a finite size effect ( and we shall come back to this point in the next section ) . however for very small systems this behavior is not visible .",
    "this is shown in the right parts of figs .",

    "the calculation has been done at a temperature such that the average energy @xmath47 is the same as in the @xmath39 case , to be sure that the expected region of the backbending is explored .",
    "the @xmath36 as well as the @xmath21 distributions are monomodal , and no bimodality is ever seen for any value of @xmath48 in this small lattice .",
    "the fact that this is correlated to a finite size effect is demonstrated in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the same trend is observed keeping the reduced magnetization constant and varying only the size of the lattice .",
    "this behavior can be understood because the correlation between @xmath36 ( and so the energy ) and @xmath22 becomes looser the smaller the size of the system .",
    "for very small systems the width of the two peaks becomes comparable to their distance and the bimodality can not be seen any more .",
    "an intuitive understanding of this phenomenon can be obtained looking at fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , which gives the total energy as a function of the metropolis steps for two systems , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , at the same density @xmath51 .",
    "the width of the distribution is comparable for the two lattice sizes ( the energy jump evolves slowly with @xmath52  @xcite ) , but in the small lattice the large fluctuations around each solution do not allow to resolve the two peaks  @xcite . an equivalent way of expressing the same idea is to recall that the two different energy solutions or phases which give the backbending correspond to very different spatial extensions .",
    "these configurations can not be explored in the small lattice because of the boundary condition constraint .",
    "we have just shown that for ( not too ) small systems , the energy distribution of the imfm can be bimodal .",
    "a systematic study of this phenomenon can been found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if this bimodality ( or , equivalently , backbending of the microcanonical caloric curve ) would survive up to the thermodynamic limit , at the canonical temperature @xmath43 at which the two peaks have the same height , one would observe at the thermodynamic limit a jump in the average energy from the disordered to the ordered phase .",
    "@xmath43 would then be the transition temperature of a conventional first order phase transition with a finite latent heat .",
    "in section  [ sec3 ] we have noticed that the bimodality in energy is correlated to a bimodality in @xmath36 , therefore an indication about the thermodynamic limit of the energy distribution can be obtained from an inspection of the size distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the distributions of fragment sizes at the fixed magnetization density @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ]  @xcite . at a given lattice size",
    ", a two parameter power law fit has been performed for each temperature ; the temperature at which the @xmath54 of the fit is minimum is then defined as the `` critical '' temperature and reported in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] as a dashed line ( for @xmath55 ) and as a dotted line ( for @xmath56 )  @xcite .",
    "a first order transition is clearly indicated in the bigger lattice calculation . at a temperature slightly lower than @xmath13 ( lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and lower horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) the `` infinite '' percolation cluster is still present . at a temperature slightly higher than @xmath13 ( lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and higher horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) the `` infinite '' percolation cluster has disappeared . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the disappearance point of the percolation cluster does not correspond to a power law ( and in fact finite size scaling of the cluster size distributions is violated on the dotted line up to the critical point  @xcite ) .",
    "similar results have also been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the case of very small lattices",
    "the percolation cluster is so small that its size is comparable to the size of the other fragments ; this creates an apparent and transient power law behavior in the middle of the coexistence zone  @xcite which is a finite size effect which should not be confused with a continuous transition .",
    "the sudden disappearance of the percolation cluster suggests a finite jump in the distribution of @xmath36 at the transition temperature in the thermodynamic limit , and consequently a finite latent heat . for the results of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] to be compatible with zero energy jump it is however enough that the size of the largest cluster increases more slowly than @xmath57 with increasing lattice size .    from a conceptual point of view we do not expect that the bimodality of the @xmath36 distribution or equivalently the backbending of the caloric curve converge to a discontinuity at the thermodynamic limit . indeed the van hove theorem  @xcite guarantees , for short range forces , the equivalence of the ensembles at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore the imfm equations of state should converge to the ising ones even in the coexistence region of first order phase transitions",
    ". moreover the ising model belongs to the liquid - gas universality class ( the imfm is in fact isomorphous to the canonical lattice - gas model at constant volume ) and this implies that the imfm at the thermodynamic limit should be equivalent to the macroscopic liquid gas phase transition at constant volume which exhibits a continuous caloric curve with no energy jump at a constant temperature . on the other side , if one constructs a lattice gas model at fixed pressure  @xcite the backbending is visible even for very small lattice sizes and should converge to a plateau in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the constant volume and constant pressure situations are the same in the particular case of zero pressure which corresponds to an infinite volume independent of the number of particles ( i.e. of the magnetization @xmath22 ) .",
    "since the infinite volume is a constant pressure situation , a backbending is expected for the microcanonical caloric curve of the finite system in an infinite volume i.e. for a density going to zero .",
    "this is indeed what is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] above .",
    "the left side of fig .  [ fig6 ] can be interpreted in this context as a calculation at constant ( low ) pressure , such that the spatial extension of the system is not constrained by any boundary conditions ( @xmath58 ) . within this interpretation",
    "it is natural that the backbendings observed in ref .",
    "@xcite appear for large lattice sizes compared to the number of particles .",
    "going towards the thermodynamic limit however the isobar and isochore paths correspond to different physical situations and an energy jump should be associated only to a transformation at constant pressure .",
    "the transient nature of the bimodality can be in principle directly demonstrated looking at the distance between the two energy peaks at the transition temperature ( energy jump )  @xcite at fixed magnetization as a function of the lattice size .",
    "table  [ table ] shows the magnitude of the energy jump between the two peaks for several lattices between @xmath59 and @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "this calculation is excessively delicate .",
    "indeed , the transition region in large lattices is very narrow , and the bimodality is only seen in a very short range of @xmath48 ( @xmath60 for @xmath50 ) .",
    "the transition temperature is then obtained by a ferrenberg - swendsen algorithm  @xcite which moves the energy histograms found at a certain @xmath48 at which the bimodality is present , and finds the @xmath43 at which both peaks have the same height .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] illustrates this procedure .",

    "@xmath43 is found to be @xmath61 . ]",
    "the results of table  [ table ] show a tendency of the distance between the peaks to decrease , although very slowly . extending this study to larger lattices",
    "is a very hard computational task .",
    "appart from the increase in computer time of monte carlo steps ( @xmath62 ) , when @xmath52 is very large , the monte carlo time between jumps increases too , what makes very difficult to perform the ferrenberg - swendsen analysis described above . for the moment , making this analysis for lattice sizes @xmath63 lies beyond the possibilities of our present computers .",
    "the fact that energy can play the role of an order parameter in the imfm , as well as its transient character , has been up to now discussed in the framework of numerical simulations . whatever the numerical procedure , the quality of the exploration of the phase space becomes increasingly delicate with increasing number of possible configurations , i.e. size of the lattice . in this section",
    "we shall therefore make use of the fact that ising belongs to the liquid - gas universality class to show in a simple analytical liquid drop model that    * the microcanonical caloric curve can backbend at constant volume * this backbending disappears at the thermodynamic limit * the convergence can be very slow and it is not surprising that an apparent energy jump still survives for lattice sizes as large as @xmath56 .",
