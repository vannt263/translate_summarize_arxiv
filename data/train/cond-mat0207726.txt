    "pzn-@xmath19pt has a cubic ( c ) perovskite - type structure at high temperatures , and undergoes a diffuse ferroelectric phase transition at low temperatures .",
    "it has been reported that the ferroelectric region is separated into rhombohedral ( r ) and tetragonal ( t ) symmetries by a morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) , a nearly vertical line between the two phases , at @xmath22% .",
    "the piezoelectric response of pzn-@xmath19pt reaches the maximum at @xmath23% , which is located on the r ( lower @xmath19 ) side near mpb  @xcite .",
    "these behaviors are qualitatively similar to those of pzt .",
    "however , pzn-@xmath19pt can be grown in single crystal form unlike pzt , so that the structural properties can be studied in more detail .    a typical strain field loop for a poled pzn-8%pt single crystal at room temperature ( rt ) , where an electric field is applied along the pseudo - cubic @xmath24 $ ] direction ( @xmath9 $ ] ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) after park and shrout .",
    "the strain increases linearly below a certain threshold field , then jumps discontinuously , which is called the @xmath12-jump .",
    "et al . _",
    "studied pzn-8%pt by x - ray diffraction and found that the field dependence of the lattice parameter exactly reflects the strain behavior , which indicates the observed high macroscopic strain levels indeed originate from the microscopic strain of the lattice  @xcite .",
    "in addition , they found that the structure of pzn-8%pt exhibits an irreversible change from the zero - field r phase to different phases by applying electric fields  @xcite .",
    "subsequent x - ray measurements at rt by noheda _",
    "_ have identified the symmetries of the various phases appearing in pzn-8%pt  @xcite .",
    "they have shown that the zero - field r phase starts to follow the direct polarization path to the t symmetry via an intermediate monoclinic ( m@xmath14 ) phase  @xcite , but then jumps irreversibly to an alternate path involving a different type of monoclinic distortion ( m@xmath11 )  @xcite , as schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .",
    "their result suggests that there is a very narrow region of monoclinic phase nestled against mpb as found for pzt .",
    "the maximum piezoelectric activity is located in the monoclinic phase near mpb in both pzt and pzn-@xmath19pt .",
    "these observations have resulted in the concept of the polarization rotation mechanism by fu and cohen  @xcite , which successfully explains the ultra - high electromechanical response .",
    "whereas the direction of the polarization vector in a conventional tetragonal ferroelectric phase is fixed to the [ 001 ] ( e.g. , pbtio@xmath6 ) or [ 111 ] ( e.g. , batio@xmath6 ) direction , the monoclinic symmetry allows the polarization vector a much greater degree of freedom as it is only constrained to lie within the @xmath25 plane for m@xmath14 and the ( 010 ) plane for m@xmath11 . in the monoclinic phases",
    ", the polarization direction can easily adjust to the electric field , thus naturally gives a large piezoelectric response .",
    "although the presence of a monoclinic phase in a cubic perovskite system seems quite unusual , it is now understood within the framework of an extended devonshire theory for strongly anharmonic crystals , which require higher order terms  @xcite .",
    "as described above , pzn-8%pt shows a complicated field - induced phase transitions : r @xmath10 m@xmath14 @xmath10",
    "m@xmath11 @xmath10 t on increasing field and t @xmath10 m@xmath11 on decreasing field  @xcite . to clarify the origin of the exceptional piezoelectric character of this system , it is necessary to resolve the complexities of the transformation sequences in more detail .",
    "et al . _ have carried out neutron diffraction experiments on pzn-8%pt single crystals as a function of applied electric field  @xcite .",
    "they have confirmed the irreversible r @xmath10 m@xmath14 @xmath10 m@xmath11 sequence reported in x - ray diffraction experiments .",
    "however , the sharp @xmath12-jump observed in strain and x - ray measurements was not reproduced . instead , they have found a marked asymmetry of the ( 002 ) bragg peak line shapes along the @xmath12-axis , indicating a non - uniform strain distribution within the crystal , which washes out the @xmath12-jump .",
    "their subsequent high - energy x - ray study of the same crystals has supported this view .    in the present study",
    ", we have carried out high @xmath26-resolution neutron diffraction experiments of pzn-8%pt in the temperature and electric - field ranges @xmath7  k and @xmath8  kv / cm , which are significantly extended than those of the previous work .",

    "the present article is organized as follows : the experimental details are given in section  ii . in section  iii ,",
    "we show our experimental results on the structural phase transitions under various sequences .",
    "we first clarify that pzn-8%pt does _ not _ transform to the r phase in the zero - field cooling ( zfc ) process as widely believed , but to a yet unidentified phase , which we call the x phase .",
    "we then describe the temperature dependence in the field cooling ( fc ) process , and the electric field dependence at fixed temperatures .",
    "these results are summarized in an @xmath1-@xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "discussions on the novel x phase and the established @xmath1-@xmath0 phase diagram are given in section  iv .",
    "neutron diffraction measurements have been performed mainly on the 8@xmath158@xmath152  mm@xmath27 single crystal .",
    "this crystal was grown by the flux solution method  @xcite at the pennsylvania state university .",
    "the as - grown crystal was poled at 10 kv / cm at rt .",
    "the strain curves measured along [ 001 ] as a function of electric field were used to check the quality of the crystals . as shown for a typical example in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the crystals we studied exhibit a sharp jump in the @xmath12-axis lattice spacing around 15  kv / cm .",
    "the neutron diffraction experiments were carried out on the tohoku university triple - axis spectrometer topan ( 6 g ) installed in the jrr-3 m reactor located at the japan atomic energy research institute in tokai , japan .",
    "most of the experiments were performed using the tight horizontal beam collimation 15@xmath28 - 10@xmath28-s-10@xmath28-b ( s = sample , b = blank ) with two pyrolytic graphite ( pg ) filters before and after the sample to eliminate higher harmonics in the neutron beam .",
    "the incident neutron energy ( @xmath29 ) was tuned to 14.7 mev ( @xmath30 = 2.36  ) with a highly oriented pg ( hopg ) monochromator .",
    "gold electric wires insulated with alumina tubes were carefully connected to the sample which was mounted on the cold head of a high - temperature closed cycle refrigerator ( ht - cti , 15 @xmath31 600 k ) .",
    "a high electric field was generated with the matsusada ar - series high voltage power supply .",
    "the sample was wrapped with the glass wool for electric insulation , and fixed softly to a specially designed copper sample holder with care not to give unnecessary stress .",
    "the crystal was oriented to give the ( h0l ) scattering plane and the electrodes were attached to the ( 001 ) surfaces .",
    "thus electric field was applied along the pseudo - cubic [ 001 ] direction in the present study . the lattice constant of pzn-8%pt in the cubic phase at @xmath0 = 540 k , @xmath1 = 0 kv / cm is @xmath13 = 4.04  , thus the 1 r.l.u .",

    "the pzn-8%pt crystal transforms into the t phase from the c phase as expected , associated with 90@xmath36-domain formation , which was confirmed by observing a peak splitting of the ( 002 ) reflection along the [ 001 ] direction . by fitting the ( 002 ) reflection with a double gaussian function",

    "the ( 200 ) and ( 002 ) peak profiles are perfectly centered when @xmath32 and @xmath33 were set to the same value ( 1.555 @xmath35 in the c phase ) . on the other hand , the peak center of the ( 002 ) profiles in the x",
    "phase shifts to higher @xmath26 compared with that of ( 200 ) , which indicates pzn-8%pt is not in the r symmetry after zfc .",
    "we also studied ( 101 ) peak profile and found no sign of the expected peak split of the rhombohedral structure , although a mosaic broadening was observed .",
    "as for the lattice constants , @xmath37 gradually increases with decreasing temperature and suddenly drops with a large amount at 340 k , where the t @xmath10 x phase transition takes place .    although it is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we also observed the intensity jump at the transition temperatures , 500 k and 340 k. the integrated intensity of the ( 002 ) reflection in the x phase ( i@xmath39 ) is 1.5 times larger than that in the t - phase ( i@xmath40 ) , and five times larger than that in the c - phase ( i@xmath18 ) ( @xmath41 ) , which indicates that the extinction effect  @xcite is phased out through transitions .",
    "in the zero - field heating process ( zfh ) , the x @xmath10 t phase transition takes place at 380 k with a large hysteresis ; the transition temperature is 40 k higher than that of the cooling process , while the t @xmath10 c phase transition shows a small hysteresis @xmath4210",

    "[ fig:2](a ) , we studied the temperature dependence of the lattice constants of pzn-8%pt crystal under fields ( @xmath1 = 0.5 , 2.0 , 6.0 , 10.0 kv / cm ) on cooling , thus fc processes . to obtain a comprehensive picture of the pzn-8%pt structural properties under the fc process , we took mesh scans around the ( 002 ) and ( 200 ) reflections at 540 k , 400 k and 300 k with the electric field @xmath1 = 0.5 kv / cm ( see fig .  [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in section ii , we fixed the @xmath32 and @xmath33 values at 1.555 @xmath35 throughout the scans .",
    "the followings are remarks of the mesh scan results .",
    "( a ) at 540 k , neither elongation nor contraction of the lattice constants was seen .",
    "the pzn-8%pt system is still in the cubic symmetry .",
    "( b ) at 400 k , the elongation of the lattice constant @xmath37 and the contraction of the lattice constant @xmath38 were clearly seen .",
    "thus the pzn-8%pt crystal transforms into the t phase . as shown in the contour maps of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , additional peaks appears near ( 002 ) and ( 200 ) in the t phase .",

    "[ fig:5](c ) , the ( 200 ) peak split into three peaks i.e.  ( 200 ) twin peaks and one ( 020 ) single peak , while the ( 002 ) peak remains as a single peak .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows the temperature dependence of the lattice constants observed at @xmath1 = 2.0",
    "we also measured the ( 200 ) reflection at 450 k , the ( 200 ) and the ( 020 ) reflections at 300 k to obtain the information of the lattice constant @xmath38 at 450 k , @xmath43 and @xmath44 at 300 k respectively .",
    "the lattice constant @xmath37 gradually increases as the temperature decreases and suddenly drops largely at 340 k , where the t @xmath10 m@xmath18 phase transition takes place",

    "[ fig:2](b ) , we also observed the electric field ( @xmath1 ) dependence of the lattice constants at some selected temperatures : ( 1 ) from the c phase at 550 k and 520 k , ( 2 ) from the x phase at 300 k , 330 k , 345 k , and 360 k. the x phase in ( 2 ) was realized by fc from 550 k to 300 k followed by fh to the target temperature .",
    "note in particular that pzn-8%pt is in the t @xmath10 x hysteresis loop at 360 k. following the precedent routine , we also took a ( h0l ) mesh scan around the pseudo - cubic ( 200 ) position .",
    "as mentioned before , the peak structure around ( 200 ) strongly depends on the nature of the phase appearing in pzn-8%pt .",

    ", the lattice constants do not return to the home position , but still remain in the m@xmath18 symmetry .",
    "it is now clear that the m@xmath18 phase is another ground state of pzn-8%pt at 330 k.    next we measured the @xmath12-axis jump ( @xmath12-jump ) on the poled pzn-8%pt crystal at 360 k which is located inside the hysteresis loop of the reversible t @xmath10 m@xmath18 phase transition .",

    "[ fig:1](a )",
    ". this is ascribed to a strain distribution in the bulk  @xcite .",

    "[ fig:8](a ) , the lattice constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 at @xmath1 = 0.0 kv / cm show a significant difference as much as @xmath56 0.07% . this difference is also seen in the ( 200 ) and ( 002 ) peak profiles of the c phase and x phase as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "this means that the pzn-8%pt crystal is _ not _ in the rhombohedral symmetry after the zfc process as it has been long believed .",
    "an important question is how pzn-8%pt can distinguish between the @xmath46 and @xmath47 directions under the zfc process .",
    "this is most likely due to a sample treatment effect such as poling , quenching , attachment of electrodes to the @xmath12 plane , sample holding and so on .",
    "it would be interesting to study the effects on the x phase formation .",
    "as for the microscopic mechanism , a phase shift model proposed by hirota _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the relaxor pbmg@xmath2nb@xmath3o@xmath6 ( pmn ) would give a clue to understand the x phase .",
    "they analyzed the diffuse intensity of pmn and found that the ionic displacements are divided into two categories ; a phase shift ( @xmath57 ) common to all the ions and each ionic displacement which satisfies the center of mass condition as is the case for ordinary ferroelectric systems such as pbtio@xmath6 .",
    "it is speculated that the inhomogeneity of mg@xmath58 and nb@xmath59 distribution creates a local electric field gradient and interacts with polar nano regions resulting in such a phase shift . if the mg@xmath58 and nb@xmath59 distribution orients to a certain direction by a sample treatment as presented above , the phase shift is also orients and results in the anisotropy of the crystal lattice .",
    "we speculate that this type of phase shift also exists in the pzn-8%pt crystal and causes a significant difference between the @xmath46 and @xmath47 lattice constants .",
    "one of the main goal for the relaxor physics is to understand and calculate how a large piezoelectric response is realized .",
    "the discovery of the novel x phase as a ground state of pzn-8%pt around rt urges revisions of theoretical frameworks of relaxors .",
    "in particular , the polarization rotation mechanism@xcite , which successfully explains the high electromechanical responses , is largely based on the correct assignment of the symmetries of various structural phases .",
