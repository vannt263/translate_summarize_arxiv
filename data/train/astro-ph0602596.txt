    "the most direct method currently available for tracing the bolometric luminosities of high redshift star - forming galaxies ( @xmath29 ) has been from their submillimeter emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , current sensitivity limits of bolometers and submillimeter wave interferometers allow for only the most luminous starburst galaxies to be detected at high redshifts via their dust emission . further compounding the problem is the coarse spatial resolution provided by such instruments , making it difficult to distinguish the counterpart(s ) to the submillimeter emission for subsequent followup , although the recently developed method of radio - detection has been a breakthrough in alleviating this problem for most , but not all , bright submillimeter galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "regardless , the dust properties of the vast majority of star - forming galaxies at high redshift remained uninvestigated until recently .",
    "the rest - frame far - infrared ( fir ) wavelength region is still inaccessible for the _ typical _ galaxy at redshifts @xmath30 , so we must look to other portions of the spectrum to directly examine dust properties .",
    "our understanding of the mid - ir properties of local and high redshift galaxies advanced considerably with the launch of the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) , which was sensitive enough to detect the mid - ir emission of @xmath31  l@xmath5 galaxies at @xmath32 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these observations revealed the almost ubiquitous presence of mid - ir dust emission features in star forming galaxies in both the local and @xmath33 universe , and suggested the possibility of using the mid - ir dust emission of galaxies as a tracer of bolometric luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these advances now continue with the highly successful _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope , providing the same sensitivity as iso in probing dust emission from @xmath31  l@xmath5 galaxies at @xmath15 .",
    "the progress made with _",
    "spitzer _ is particularly important for studying galaxies at @xmath15 because this epoch was until recently largely uninvestigated , yet is believed to be the most active in terms of star formation and the build up of stellar and black hole mass ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the sensitivity afforded by the _ spitzer _",
    "mips instrument allows us to examine the _ typical _ @xmath34 galaxy at @xmath15 , rather than a limited slice of the most luminous population , a problem which , as alluded to before , limits the usefulness of submillimeter observations .",
    "it is fortuitous that the rest - frame mid - ir spectral features observed in local and @xmath33 star - forming galaxies are redshifted into the _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectral and mips imaging passbands at @xmath15 .",
    "the mid - ir spectral region from @xmath35  @xmath1 m is rich with emission lines believed to arise from the stochastic heating of small dust grains by uv photons ( see review by @xcite )",
    ". these unidentified infrared bands ( uibs ) are generally attributed to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 stretching and bending vibrational modes of a class of carbonaceous molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which we assume hereafter . in the typical spectrum of a star - forming galaxy , these pah emission lines ,",
    "along with various fine - structure metal and hi recombination lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , are superposed on a mid - ir continuum thought to result from dust emission from very small grains , or vsgs @xcite . in star - forming galaxies , the global pah emission",
    "is mainly attributed to uv radiation from ob stars and has been found to correlate with global star formation rate ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although variations with ionizing intensity and metallicity are also observed ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    until now ,",
    "the only way to estimate the bolometric luminosities of most galaxies at @xmath15 independent of extinction was via their stacked x - ray and radio emission : unfortunately these data are not sufficiently sensitive to detect individual @xmath34 galaxies at @xmath38 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "data considered in this paper are useful in assessing the bolometric luminosities of galaxies on an individual basis .",
    "one is still limited because detailed mid - ir spectroscopy is feasible only for the most luminous galaxies at @xmath15 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , but @xmath39 galaxies at @xmath15 ( with @xmath40  l@xmath5 ) can be detected in deep @xmath0  @xmath1 m images .",

    "note the large @xmath140  @xmath74 dispersion of a factor of 2.2 in the ir / mir flux ratio .",
    "the dispersion in the ir / mir flux ratios between galaxies may be driven partly by changes in the mid - ir line strengths as the aromatic carriers are dehydrogenated and/or destroyed depending on the intensity of the ambient uv ionizing field ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "metallicity effects and a changing distribution of dust with respect to hii regions also likely contribute to the observed factor of @xmath141 dispersion in the ir / mir ratios .",

    "based on the sample of 149 galaxies from @xcite , we assume @xmath143 to convert @xmath8 to @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth noting that the relationship between @xmath8 and total ir luminosity for _ local _ star - forming galaxies may be described by a more complicated function , such as a two power - law fit ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these complicated relationships may not apply to galaxies at @xmath15 for several reasons .",
    "first , the ir / mir ratio may change depending on the relative contribution of older stellar populations in heating pah and larger dust grains .",
    "the heating of dust by cooler stars is expected to be more prevalent for the less luminous local galaxies with older stellar populations , on average , than for @xmath15 galaxies with relatively younger stellar populations .",
    "second , it is found that @xmath15 galaxies have metallicities that are on average @xmath144  dex lower than those of local galaxies at a given stellar mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , the metallicity dependence of the ir / mir ratio found for local galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggests that we may not be able to ascribe the ir / mir ratio for a galaxy of a given stellar mass at @xmath145 to a galaxy at @xmath15 with the same stellar mass . a third possibility , and",
    "one that is suggested by the results of this paper and other studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , is that the dust obscuration of galaxies at a given bolometric luminosity changes as function of redshift , a result that may reflect dust enrichment and/or a changing configuration of dust as galaxies age .",

    "regardless of these small differences in the stellar populations of @xmath0  @xmath1 m detected and undetected sources , the x - ray data indicate that the primary reason why galaxies are undetected at @xmath0  @xmath1 m is because they have lower sfrs ( figure  [ fig : pahvxray ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate in the next section how the rest - frame uv spectral properties of galaxies can be used to interpret their @xmath0  @xmath1 m emission .",
    "a unique advantage of our optical @xmath2 selection is the efficiency with which we are able to obtain rest - frame uv spectra for these galaxies , and this spectroscopy allows for an independent probe of the physical conditions in the ism . while the s / n of any individual spectrum is typically too low to accurately measure interstellar absorption line widths , we can take advantage of the large number of spectra by stacking them to create a higher s / n composite spectrum . to investigate differences in the ism as a function of infrared luminosity , we constructed composite uv spectra for ( a ) the top quartile of @xmath0  @xmath1 m detected @xmath2 galaxies , and ( b ) all @xmath2 galaxies undetected at @xmath0  @xmath1 m . in order to stack the spectra , we first de - redshifted them by the systemic redshift .",

    "however , given that the bolometric luminosity of star - forming galaxies scales with dust - obscuration ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : bolo ] ) , we might expect @xmath0  @xmath1 m detected galaxies to have larger dust column densities than undetected galaxies ; this may partly explain the absence of ly@xmath146 emission in @xmath0  @xmath1 m detected galaxies .",
    "in addition , the velocity spread of the ism will also affect the emergent ly@xmath146 profile : the larger velocity spread in @xmath0  @xmath1 m detected galaxies , as indicated by their stronger interstellar absorption lines , implies most ly@xmath146 photons will have larger scattering path - lengths and are more likely to be attenuated by dust and/or scattered out of resonance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    finally , we note that the stacked x - ray analysis of @xmath0  @xmath1m - undetected galaxies confirms they have lower sfrs than @xmath0  @xmath1m - detected galaxies .",
    "therefore , galaxies are undetected at rest - frame @xmath7  @xmath1 m primarily because they have lower sfrs and not because they are deficient in mid - ir pah luminosity for a given @xmath11 .",
    "if such undetected galaxies had depressed mir / ir flux ratios , we would not have expected to see as large a difference in the strengths of their interstellar absorption lines as compared with @xmath0  @xmath1 m detected galaxies .",

    "the implication of these observations is that while it is certainly true that a larger fraction of the star formation at high redshifts occurs in dustier galaxies , selection via rest - frame uv colors ( and performing followup spectroscopy ) is easier at high redshift than locally for galaxies at a given bolometric luminosity .",

    "finally , our knowledge of the exact positions of optical and near - ir selected galaxies from the higher spatial resolution @xmath71-band and irac data allows us to mitigate the effects of confusion ( see   [ sec : midir ] ) , so we should be reasonably complete for galaxies which are detected at @xmath0  @xmath1 m to @xmath75  @xmath1jy but which might otherwise be confused with brighter sources .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to conclude that the lirg population at @xmath15 is essentially the same population of galaxies that are selected in optical and near - ir samples .",
    "we demonstrated that lirgs and ulirgs are present over the full range of stellar mass , from @xmath329  m@xmath5 to @xmath17  m@xmath5 , for galaxies in the samples considered here ( figure  [ fig : masses ] ) . to assess the significance of the current star formation in the buildup of stellar mass , we have computed the specific star formation rate , @xmath330 , defined as the sfr per unit stellar mass .",
    "we show the observed @xmath330 for galaxies in our sample as function of stellar mass in figure  [ fig : specsfr ] .",
    "the correlation between @xmath330 and @xmath331 could have been predicted from figure  [ fig : masses ] since the range of @xmath149 is similar over the range of @xmath331 considered here .",
    "we also note that the correlation is accentuated since ( a ) @xmath330 is not independent of @xmath331 and ( b ) there are presumably galaxies with low @xmath330 and low @xmath331 that would be missing from the optical and near - ir samples ( irrespective of the mips detection limit ) .",
    "furthermore , the upper envelope of points in figure  [ fig : specsfr ] is defined by our cut to exclude luminous agn based on the _ chandra _ x - ray data .",
    "nonetheless , we find that star - forming galaxies with large stellar masses @xmath302  m@xmath5 without an agn signature have specific sfrs that are @xmath140 to @xmath332 orders of magnitude",
    "lower than those of young galaxies ( yellow symbols ) , implying that the current star formation contributes more significantly to the buildup of stellar mass in low mass galaxies than high mass galaxies at @xmath15 .",
    "this change in specific sfr as a function of mass has been observed at later epochs as well ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the shifting of the relationship to lower specific sfrs at later epochs for galaxies with large stellar masses has been referred to as `` downsizing '' @xcite .",

    "this decrease in @xmath330 suggests that @xmath307  m@xmath5 galaxies have built up most of their stellar mass by @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , the mass - doubling time becomes increasingly large for these massive galaxies if we assume the case of an exponentially declining star formation model . in this case",

    "if all star - forming galaxies at @xmath15 follow a similar evolutionary track as the @xmath307  m@xmath5 galaxies ( i.e. , follow an exponentially declining star formation history with large outflow rate ) , then the scatter of galaxies with a given specific sfr simply reflects the range in the final stellar masses and dark matter halo masses ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",

    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the specific sfr , @xmath330 , and gas fraction , @xmath1 , such that galaxies with large specific sfrs will have a larger fraction of cold gas than galaxies with small specific sfrs .",

    "these results strongly suggest that the young galaxies have large reservoirs of cold gas and have just begun forming stars .",
    "similarly , galaxies with the largest stellar masses have lower specific sfrs and therefore lower cold gas fractions ( @xmath350 ) and are likely to cease star - formation in a relatively short time .",

    "these galaxies will therefore be more dust - obscured since metallicity is directly proportional to dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "our analysis confirms our expectation that the most dust - obscured objects at @xmath15 ( i.e. , the drgs with the largest dust - to - gas ratios , figure  [ fig : bolo ] ) also have low gas fractions as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : specsfr ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : specsfr ] indicates that the trend in gas fraction versus stellar mass ( or , metallicity versus gas fraction ) found for @xmath2-selected galaxies with h@xmath146 spectroscopy @xcite also applies to galaxies selected by their near - ir colors .    combining the optical and near - ir samples , we find a wide range in the evolutionary state of galaxies at @xmath15 , from those which are just starting to form stars to those which have already accumulated most of their stellar mass and are about to become passive or already are .",
    "almost all drgs with the reddest @xmath210 color ( @xmath213 ) are undetected at @xmath0  @xmath1 m and in the deep _ chandra _ x - ray data ( e.g. , see right panel of figure  [ fig : lircol ] and figure  16 in @xcite ) .",

    "the mid - ir ( @xmath7  @xmath1 m ) features associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission , which are ubiquitous in local and @xmath33 star - forming galaxies , are shifted into the mips @xmath0  @xmath1 m filter .",
    "extensive multi - wavelength data in the goods - north field , including very deep _ chandra _ x - ray data , allow us to test the validity of inferring the bolometric luminosities of high redshift galaxies from their rest - frame @xmath7  @xmath1 m emission .",
    "galaxies at @xmath15 are selected by their optical ( @xmath2 ) and near - ir ( @xmath49 and @xmath68 ) colors , and for comparison we also consider radio - detected submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; @xcite ) .",

    "galaxies with @xmath179 have @xmath11 greater than @xmath332 times that of galaxies with @xmath358 .",
    "non - agn galaxies with the reddest near - ir colors ( @xmath213 ) are mostly undetected at @xmath0  @xmath1 m suggesting they have low sfrs , a conclusion supported by stacked x - ray analyses .",

    "we infer that typically half of the bolometric luminosity of these @xmath0  @xmath1m - undetected galaxies is emitted in the uv . comparing",
    "the rest - frame uv composite spectra of @xmath0  @xmath1m - undetected galaxies with those in the top quartile of detected objects shows that the latter have low - ionization interstellar absorption lines that are @xmath333 times stronger than the former , indicating some combination of more turbulent interstellar media and a larger neutral gas covering fraction .",

    "a comparison between the dust obscuration in @xmath15 and @xmath145 galaxies suggests that galaxies of a _ given _ bolometric luminosity are much less dust obscured ( by a factor of @xmath363 ) at high redshift than at the present epoch .",
    "this result is expected ( a ) as galaxies age and go through successive generations of star formation and dust production and ( b ) if the distribution of dust and star formation in galaxies becomes more compact over time ( e.g. , through mergers or interactions ) resulting in greater dust column densities towards star - forming regions .",
    "we find that star - forming distant red galaxies ( drgs ) with stellar masses @xmath246  m@xmath5 and ages @xmath271  gyr have bolometric luminosities and dust - obscuration factors similar to those of local ulirgs , suggesting that such drgs , like local ulirgs , carry relatively large amounts of dust into their current episodes of star formation .",
