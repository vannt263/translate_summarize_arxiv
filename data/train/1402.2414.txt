    "the title of this essay is obviously polemic with the title of the first section -_information is physical _ - of the famous rolf landauer s paper _ the physical nature of information _ @xcite .",
    "this paper was quite influential and stimulated , among the others , the modern advances in the study of relations between information theory and thermodynamics .",
    "this new wave of research is parallel to the rapid development of `` quantum information '' and `` quantum computing '' ( although landauer himself was quite skeptical about the later ) .",
    "the aim of my note is to challenge the popular opinions concerning relations between physics and information theory ( see @xcite for references to other critical contributions ) . in particular",
    ", i would like to present the following thesis and support at least some of them by suitable models : + i ) information @xmath0 , measured for simplicity in _ nats _",
    "( @xmath1 bits ) , * is a disembodied abstract entity independent of its physical carrier*. in particular , multiplying @xmath0 by the boltzmann constant @xmath2 or thermal energy @xmath3 does not yield thermodynamical entropy or meaningful energy which should be taken into account in the energy - entropy balance related to the first and second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the direct interpretation of the title of the paper is that the quantities like @xmath4 or @xmath5 possess no physical meaning .",
    "+ ii ) it is true that , as landauer wrote : _",
    "`` [ information ] is always tied to a physical representation .",
    "it is represented by engraving on a stone tablet , a spin , a charge , a hole in a punched card , a mark on paper , or some other equivalent .",
    "this ties the handling of information to all the possibilities and restrictions of our real physical word , its laws of physics and its storehouse''_. + however , the legitimate questions concern the physical properties of * information carriers * like `` stone tablet , a spin , a charge , a hole in a punched card , a mark on paper '' , but not the information itself . the examples of legitimate questions are the following :    \\a ) what is the error of encoding , readout and generally processing of information carried by specific physical systems in given environments ?",
    "+ b ) what is the life - time of information encoded in a given physical system in a given environment ? +",
    "c ) what is the minimal amount of work needed to change the encoded information ?",
    "+ d ) what is the time needed to perform a single step of information processing ? +",
    "e ) what are the relations between the quantities of above ?",
    "+ iii ) to encode information one needs physical systems possessing a number of distinguishable and stable with respect to thermal and quantum noise states .",
    "the distinguishability of states can be quantified in terms of their overlap , well - defined for classical and quantum systems .",
    "only well - distinguishable states can be cloned with a high accuracy and protected against noise for long times .",
    "therefore , for example , gas of atoms may possess a well - defined entropy but does not encode any information ] .",
    "+ iv ) information is neither classical nor quantum , it is independent of the properties of physical systems used to its processing .",
    "for example , in the problem of factoring of integers the input and output is information and can be quantified in bits or nats .",
    "the question of efficiency , i.e. the amount of resources needed to perform this task with a given level of confidence , is in principle a physical question .",
    "only because our present day computers are based on macroscopic elements , which are highly stable on human time - scale and are applied to moderately large inputs and outputs appropriate again to the human scale , we can still disregard , to a large extend , physical limitations and apply abstract complexity theory to efficiency problems .",
    "+ v ) the importance of `` information '' in physics is highly overestimated in the recent times .",
    "one often says that all physical phenomena are instances of `` information processing '' .",
    "such general statement possess a prediction power and hence a scientific value rather low . on the contrary , all fundamental theories starting from classical mechanics and ending with quantum field theory and its possible new versions ( string theory , quantum gravity , etc . )",
    "can be formulated without reference to any kind of information .",
    "even entropy in statistical mechanics need not information - theoretical interpretation and can be treated simply as the ( averaged ) logarithm of the number of accessible states .",
    "+ vi ) `` quantum information '' is the name of a fashionable field of research and not a different kind of information .",
    "the use of strongly overlapping quantum states as information carriers seems to be rather counter - factual as such states becomes more and more fragile when the size of the system increases .",
    "in contrast to many claims there are no proofs of quantum fault - tolerance based on physically acceptable assumptions .",
    "however , one can not exclude that the high speed of operations achieved for microscopic systems may compensate the high probability of errors and lead to a construction of some useful special purpose quantum devices of moderate size . in this case efficiency",
    "becomes a physical problem what makes formal `` quantum complexity theory '' not very useful .",
    "ultimately , the probability of success for any quantum computer scales down exponentially with the size of the task and no  probability amplification  is possible .. ]",
    "the mother of all misconceptions concerning the relations between information theory and thermodynamics is the szilard s explanation of the maxwell demon paradox in 1929 .",
    "while smoluchowski in 1912 @xcite gave a mechanistic interpretation of the paradox in terms of the trap - door model of maxwell demon which is a subject of thermal fluctuations , szilard @xcite introduced the notion of measurement into the game .",
    "the measurement understood as acquiring a bit ( or @xmath6 nats ) of information immediately led to the interpretation of @xmath7 as thermodynamical entropy and @xmath8 as the minimal work which should be invested by external sources .",
    "this idea initiated a never ending discussion about the place where the external work must be invested in order to save the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "various arguments presented by different authors were based essentially of the second law combined with the postulate of additivity of entropy for the joint system of information carrier and heat bath .",
    "this postulate has been critically discussed in @xcite .",
    "the szilard engine consists of a box , containing only a single gas particle , in thermal contact with a heat bath , and a partition .",
    "the partition can be inserted into the box , dividing it into two equal volumes , and is also capable of sliding , frictionless , along the box to the left or to the right .",
    "now one assumes that * if it is known which side the molecule is on * ( @xmath6 nats of information ) , it is possible to connect up the partition to a pulley and extract @xmath9 work in a process which can be repeated .",
    "however , inserting the partition reduces the entropy of the single particle gas from the ( poorly defined in the classical case ) value @xmath10 to @xmath11 and hence increases the free energy of the gas from the value @xmath12 to the value @xmath13 . +",
    "* the well - defined excess free energy @xmath14 , which can be transformed into useful work , is objective and does not depend on anybody s knowledge `` of which side the molecule is on '' . * + indeed",
    ", it is not difficult to design , within the same level of idealization , procedures of extracting work without knowing the position of the particle ( see fig .",
    "1(a)(b ) ) .",
    "the missing work necessary to save the second law is hidden in the operation of the partition .",
    "namely , the position of the partition inside the box must be stable with respect to thermal fluctuations and hence separated from the position `` partition outside the box '' by the energy barrier of the height @xmath15 ( fig.1c ) .",
    "therefore to move the partition from one position to the other one needs at least several @xmath3 of work to overcome the energy barrier of work . ] .",
    "friction is necessary to stabilize the partition in the new position and the supplied work is dissipated into environment . summarizing , * the operation of the szilard engine can be easily explained without any reference to measurement and information*.",
    "the basic element needed for operation of the szilard engine is a partition which is an example of a * switch * - a system with ( at least ) two distinguishable and stable states and a mechanism which changes one state to another in an irreversible process powered by the external source of work .",
    "one can think about all information carriers as ensembles of switches with given distinguishability of states and given stability with respect to external noise .    in this and next sections",
    "i discuss a minimal quantum model of a switch and the thermodynamical bounds of its performance , and i use this model to analyze a quantum version of the szilard engine and its efficiency .",
    "the model , which was introduced and studied in details in the previous paper @xcite consists of two coupled quantum systems .",
    "the first one is microscopic , represented by a spin-@xmath16 and described by the standard pauli matrices @xmath17 .",
    "the second is the harmonic oscillator with the canonical operators @xmath18 , which represent a pointer showing the two positions of the switch .",
    "the corresponding states of the oscillator are assumed be be semi - classical an will be shown to be stable with respect to quantum and thermal noise .",
    "the hamiltonian of the total system contains a kind of `` ferromagnetic coupling '' which favorizes energetically particular position of oscillator which coincide with the spin direction along the @xmath19-axis .",
    "the switch hamiltonian has the following form @xmath20 \\label{ham_tlsqb}\\ ] ] where , the dimensionless position of the oscillator is given by @xmath21 . in the following spin eigen - states , oscillator coherent states and joint spin - oscillator states",
    "are denoted by @xmath22 two degenerate ground states of the hamiltonian are product states of spin s `` up '' ( `` down '' ) states and corresponding oscillator states localized at the positions @xmath23 and with averaged momenta equal to zero @xmath24 the information is encoded in the oscillator states @xmath25 only , which are not orthogonal . the overlap ( transition probability ) between those coherent states given by @xmath26 can serve as an encoding error measure at zero temperature .",
    "one should notice that only @xmath27 makes sense , for @xmath28 oscillator states are completely indistinguishable .    in the next step a weak interaction with a large quantum bath at the temperature @xmath29 is added . in the simplest , minimal model this coupling",
    "is described by two interaction hamiltonians @xmath30 where @xmath31 are independent environment observables .",
    "using standard methods one can derive quantum markovian master equations for the reduced density matrix of the switch .",
    "i am not going to repeat the detailed analysis of @xcite but restrict myself to the discussion of the final results .",
    "omitting first the second hamiltonian in which describes spin - flip one obtains the markovian dynamics with stationary states being mixtures of two of _ biased gibbs states _ @xmath32 any initial state @xmath33 tends asymptotically to the mixture @xmath34 with @xmath35 given by the initial probabilities of spin polarization .",
    "the corresponding oscillator states are given by @xmath36 they are well - localized and well - distinguishable ( for @xmath37 ) mixed gaussian states with the overlap ( identification , encoding , readout error ) @xmath38 the formula can be rewritten in the more convenient form of the boltzmann - like factor @xmath39 the parameter @xmath40 $ ] is the average quantum oscillator energy at the temperature @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 can be called _ noise temperature _ because it interpolates between temperature ( for @xmath43 ) and ( for @xmath44 ) zero - point energy divided by @xmath45 , thus characterizing both , thermal and quantum components of the environmental noise .",
    "the energy parameter @xmath46 is a half of energy amount @xmath47 necessary for spin - flip in one of the stable states @xmath48 to obtain the excited biased gibbs state @xmath49 one can treat @xmath50 as a height of the energy barrier which separates states @xmath48 because the difference between the averaged energy of the state @xmath51 ( placed `` halfway '' between @xmath48 and @xmath52 ) and the averaged energy of @xmath53 is exactly equal to @xmath50 ( see fig.2 ) .     and their excitations @xmath54 .",
    "gaussians depict localized oscillator states with arrows inside corresponding to spin states .",
    "the long solid arrows represent dissipation routes , while the dashed ones first steps of tunneling process or the not gate.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the picture of protecting energy barrier @xmath50 suggests the mechanism which ensures stability of switch positions .",
    "one can expect that the life - time @xmath55 of information encoded in a switch interacting with a quantum heat bath should be given by the kramers - like formula @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a life - time of unprotected information .",
    "indeed it was shown @xcite for the discussed model of switch with the spin - flip process described by the second interaction hamiltonian in that gives a leading order approximation for the life - time with @xmath57 being the life - time of the spin decoupled from the oscillator , but interacting with the same environment .",
    "the operation of changing position of the switch , which is called not gate can be executed using the following time - dependent hamiltonian acting on the spin component@xmath58 where @xmath59 is assumed to be a fast pulse concentrated around @xmath60 and satisfying @xmath61 . for a fast enough pulse the initial state @xmath48",
    "is transformed to the excited state @xmath52 and then relaxes to @xmath53 changing in an irreversible process switch position .",
    "the invested work is equal to @xmath62 and is completely dissipated during the relaxation process to the new position ( fig.2 ) .",
    "treating now the switch as a carrier of one bit of information one can derive the fundamental formulas connecting thermodynamical cost of information processing with the accuracy and stability of encoding .",
    "the discussed above quantum model of a switch seems to be minimal , is exactly solvable and based on gaussian states .",
    "such properties usually imply that the relations obtained for this particular model are optimal and therefore can be used to draw the general conclusions ( similarly to saturation of the heisenberg uncertainty relation for gaussian states ) .",
    "the accuracy of information encoding is characterized by the error @xmath63 and stability by the life - time @xmath55 . because in half of the cases of bit encoding we do nothing , in half of the cases we have to flip the spin",
    ", one can formulate , using and , the following principles : + * the minimal averaged amount of work needed to encode a bit of information is equal to * @xmath64 + * the maximal life - time of encoded bit of information scales with the error in the following way * @xmath65 both formulas look reasonable . has been earlier derived by kish @xcite for a purely classical model of an electronic switch .",
    "] one expects that encoding information in a stable carrier , say `` engraving on a stone tablet '' , should cost much more work than encoding in a less stable system like making a  hole in a punched card  .",
    "the formula is based on the universaly valid kramers - type formula including thermal transitions and quantum tunneling .",
    "in fact it is rather obvious that : + * any relation describing thermodynamical cost of information processing must take into account the accuracy and stability of information encoding , what means that the generally accepted landauer formula @xmath66 can not be correct for most instances of its application and interpretation discussed in numerous papers . *",
    "+ another property of mechanisms which stabilize information , illustrated by the discussed switch model , is a presence of dissipation ( friction ) which transforms work invested in a gate to heat .",
    "this shows a fundamental conflict between stability of information and reversibility of gates which seems to be the main obstacle for an efficient implementation of microscopically reversible computations , both classical and quantum @xcite .    the formulas and",
    "can be applied to the estimation of the minimal energy @xmath67 which is necessary to perform a long computation consisting of @xmath68 elementary steps @xcite . for really long computations ,",

    "however , the additional term @xmath72 follows from the stability and accuracy requirements . ] .",
    "it is rather obvious that is more realistic , because longer computation demands more stability which cost additional energy per single operation proportional to @xmath72 .",

    "@xmath128 is the * objective physical entropy * because when ammonia is prepared in the initial pure state @xmath117 or @xmath118 ( or alternatively , @xmath129 or @xmath130 ) its free energy is increased by @xmath131 and this amount can be transformed into work using in principle the steps iii ) and iv ) of the quantum szilard engine . on the other hand both pairs of orthogonal states",

    "are produced with equal probabilities and both optical isomers are extremally stable with the inversion time of the order of @xmath132 years .",
    "for example , in biological context alanine appears always in left - handed form .",
    "therefore , both states of alanine can encode information in a very stable way and the von neumann entropy represents the * subjective lack of knowledge * about the spatial configuration of the alanine .",
    "the entropy has no thermodynamical meaning because selection of a given left or right - handed form does not allow to extract work .    more generally , for a set of @xmath68 disjoint and equally populated states of the open system at equilibrium with the bath , @xmath133 is a thermodynamical entropy if those states are ergodic with respect to the dynamics , i.e. fast dynamical transitions between any pair of them are present .",
    "such states can not be used to encode information .",
    "if they are not ergodic , or in other words stable with respect to dynamics , @xmath72 describes the amount of information which can be encoded into this set of states . in the later case",
    "the knowledge which state is occupied by the system does not allow to extract any work from the heat bath .",

    "+    it seems that the ideas of above contradict the well - established opinion that a density matrix contains all information about the system and all decomposition of mixed states into pure or `` less mixed '' ones are equally meaningful . on the other hand",
    "there is an evidence that at least for open systems some decompositions are `` more equal '' .",
    "for example , a state of a harmonic oscillator interacting with a heat bath and observed in the semi - classical regime should be rather described as a mixture of coherent states than , for example , a mixture of energy eigenstates . only the former are localized , structurally stable and follow classical trajectories , while the later decohere very quickly . on a more general level",

    "if the particles are connected by a rigid bar the probability distribution remains the same despite the systems are strongly correlated in the physical sense . to discover the correlations we can allow the particles to interact with the random noise with a correlation length much shorter than @xmath135 .",

    "another explanation involves the algebraic formalism of infinite quantum systems . within this formalism there exist _ disjoint states _ corresponding , for example , to different thermodynamical phases .",
    "such states are stable with respect to local perturbations of dynamics , and macroscopically distinguishable .",
    "their coherent superpositions do not make sense and their mixtures must be considered as `` subjective '' , fully related to the lack of knowledge . in principle , one can apply these ideas to describe the difference between ammonia and alanine .",
    "both molecules interact with electromagnetic field - a system with infinite number of degrees of freedom described by the algebraic formalism . for a small molecule",

    "+ the so - called `` quantum error correction '' @xcite is in fact `` error prevention '' realized by suitable `` decoherence - free '' subsystems , i.e. quantum degrees of freedom which are essentially not influenced by noise . beside the decoherence - free subsystems generated by some symmetries which are always approximate and non - scalable , the other examples from the vast literature are usually extremely complicated and based on semi - phenomenological error models .    in my opinion",
    "the complexity and semi - phenomenological character of the existing fault - tolerance schemes permits to hide there `` maxwell demons '' which are otherwise not allowed within a complete quantum hamiltonian description .",
    "for example , in the standard approach based on `` threshold theorems '' a mechanism involving `` fresh qubits '' is crucial , but was never scrutinized within a hamiltonian model ( other flaws in the physical assumptions are discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "another example of a different but equivalent scheme of computation , discussed in @xcite , employs as a basic resource `` magic states '' with negative quasi - probability functions . on the other hand",
    "it is known that such `` truly quantum '' states are particularly sensitive to environmental noise .",
    "the view that information is an abstract entity independent of the physical nature of a carrier , which differs from the thermodynamical entropy and should not be included in the physical energy - entropy balance , does not mean that physics is irrelevant for the field of information processing . on the contrary , the smaller and hence less stable are devices used in the information technology the more important are physical questions concerning the nature of noise , mechanisms of stability , life - times of information carrying states , an obvious conflict between stability and reversibility of gates , thermodynamical costs of computing etc . some of these questions are discussed in this essay using new relations derived from a reasonable model which should give more realistic estimations and bounds . those bounds",
    "take into account accuracy and stability of information processing with respect to environmental noise .",
    "they are different from the generally accepted ones which are based on the equivalence of information and physical entropy advocated by szilard , brillouin , landauer , bennett and others .",
