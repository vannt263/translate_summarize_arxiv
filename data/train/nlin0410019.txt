    "let @xmath0 be a plane , closed , regular and strictly convex curve .",
    "the billiard problem on @xmath0 consists in the free motion of a point particle in the plane region enclosed by @xmath0 , with unitary velocity and being reflected elastically at the impacts with the boundary .",
    "the trajectories are polygonals in the region .",
    "the motion is completely determined by the point of reflection at @xmath0 and the direction of motion immediately after each reflection .",
    "for instance , the arclength parameter @xmath1 , which locates the point of reflection , and the tangential component of the momentum @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the angle between the direction of motion and the normal to the boundary at the reflection point , describe the system .",
    "good introductions to billiards can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the billiard model defines a map @xmath4 which to each @xmath5 in the annulus @xmath6 , representing the pair impact coordinate and direction of motion , associates the next impact and direction : @xmath7    since the particle can travel along the same polygonal in both senses , the problem is time - reversing and the inverse map @xmath8 is well defined .",
    "the derivative of @xmath4 at @xmath5 is implicitly calculated and is given by the formulae : @xmath9 where @xmath10 stands for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the distance between the two consecutive impacts points @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the radius of curvature of @xmath0 and @xmath18 is the normal component of the momentum .",
    "if @xmath0 is a @xmath19 curve , @xmath20 , the billiard model gives rise to a discrete two - dimensional @xmath21 area preserving dynamical system , whose orbits are given by @xmath22    a billiard has no fixed points .",
    "however , given @xmath23 , birkhoff s theorem states that @xmath4 has at least two different orbits of period @xmath24 which will be fixed points of @xmath25 .",
    "the linearization of @xmath25 at any of these fixed points , say @xmath5 , gives the linear area preserving map @xmath26 , which has a fixed point at the origin @xmath27 .",
    "according to the eigenvalues of this linear map , the fixed point @xmath5 is classified as : hyperbolic if the eigenvalues of are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , elliptic if the eigenvalues are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 or parabolic if the eigenvalues are 1 or -1 .    in the hyperbolic case",
    ", the hartman - grobman theorem ( see , for instance , @xcite or @xcite ) assures that , on a neighbourhood of the fixed point @xmath5 , the dynamical behaviour of @xmath25 is the same as the dynamical behaviour of @xmath26 on a neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "so , @xmath5 is an unstable fixed point of @xmath25 and @xmath35 is an unstable periodic orbit of @xmath4 . in this case",
    ", the instability of the equilibrium of the linear map @xmath26 implies the local instability of the periodic orbit for the complete map @xmath4 .    in the elliptic case , the linear map @xmath26 is a rotation : the origin is surrounded by closed invariant circles and is a stable equilibrium",
    "however , this beautiful behaviour may not be inherited by the map @xmath25 , as it can be seen in the examples on the figure bellow . for both of them , the fixed point is linearly elliptic . on the left side , the non linear map exhibit invariant closed curves surrounding the fixed point , which is then stable . for the non linear map on the right ,",
    "no invariant curves can be observed and the fixed point seems to be unstable .",
    ", with an elliptic fixed point at @xmath36 .",
    "the ergodicity implies that the fixed point is unstable .",
    "this example does not represent a billiard map and we do nt know if there are any billiards with this property . ]    3truecm    moreover , it is not even clear if the pictures above , obtained by numerical simulations , correspond to the true behaviour of the maps .",
    "in fact , dias carneiro and ourselves @xcite have proved that any * @xmath37 strictly convex * billiard map with an elliptic 2-periodic orbit can be approached by billiard maps with a 2-periodic orbit surrounded by closed invariant curves , ie , with a stable orbit .",
    "we guess this result can be extended to any period .",
    "therefore , because of natural numerical round off errors , one can not be sure that the simulation corresponds to the actual billiard at and not to a very close one .    as a consequence , in the elliptic case , a more carefull approach is needed and higher order terms must be taken into account to assure the local stability of periodic orbits . a classical way to handle",
    "this problem is to use the birkhoff normal form and moser s twist theorem @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we explain how this can be performed and applied to the billiard map in the case of 2-periodic elliptic orbits .",
    "we have employed the software maple to calculate the necessary data and all the worksheets are available at http://www.mat.ufmg.br/@xmath38syok/papers .",
    "we then apply the results to two special classes of billiards .",
    "related works are hayli , dumont , moulin - ollagnier , strelcyn @xcite and moeckel @xcite .",
    "the first authors studied the stability of periodic orbits for a family of robnik s billiards .",
    "the last author studied the generic behaviour of the first birkhoff coefficient for one - parameter families of conservative maps .",
    "let @xmath4 be an area preserving map with a @xmath24-periodic orbit @xmath39 .",
    "we will assume that the map is @xmath19 with @xmath40 . in the case of the billiard map , this is equivalent to assume that the curve @xmath0 is at least @xmath41 .",
    "the map @xmath25 can then be expanded in taylor form up to order 3 in a neighbourhood of its fixed point @xmath27 , @xmath42 if the fixed point is elliptic , with eigenvalues @xmath43 and @xmath44 , by means of a complex linear area preserving coordinate change which diagonalizes the linear part , the map @xmath25 can be written as @xmath45    if @xmath46 , @xmath47 or @xmath48 we say that @xmath28 is non resonant and an analytic coordinate change brings the map into its convergent birkhoff normal form @xmath49 the first birkoff coefficient @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the imaginary part of @xmath53 .",
    "the calculations leading to expression ( [ eq : tau1 ] ) are standard ( @xcite , @xcite ) and can also be easily performed using symbolic programming.syok/papers/3normalform . ]    by moser s twist theorem if the first birkhoff coefficient @xmath50 is not zero there are @xmath25-invariant curves surrounding the fixed point and therefore it is stable .",
    "we have that each point of the n - periodic orbit is contained in an open set , called an island , homeomorphic to a disk and invariant under @xmath25 .",
    "each island contains @xmath25-invariant curves surrounding the periodic point .",
    "so , the n - periodic orbit of @xmath4 is stable .",
    "any closed regular strictly convex @xmath54 curve @xmath0 has at least two diameters , characterized by points with parallel tangents and equal normal lines ( like the axis of an ellipse ) .",
    "the motion along each one of them corresponds to a 2-periodic trajectory for the billiard map associated to @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to prove that the longest of these diameters , if isolated , corresponds to a hyperbolic orbit ( see , for instance @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the other(s ) can be either hyperbolic , elliptic or parabolic .",
    "let us suppose that one of them is elliptic and let @xmath55 and @xmath56 be the arclength parameters of the trajectory . as the motion occurs in the normal direction ,",
    "the tangential component of the momentum @xmath57 is zero in both of the reflection points .",
    "then @xmath58 is an elliptic 2-periodic orbit of the associated billiard map @xmath59 and @xmath27 is an elliptic fixed point of @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath61 and @xmath62 be the radii of curvature of @xmath0 at the @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath63 be the length of the trajectory . using equation ( [ eq : deriv ] ) ,",
    "the linear map @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 and its eigenvalues are @xmath66 as the trajectory is elliptic the relations @xmath67 and @xmath68 must be fullfilled . assuming that @xmath69 and @xmath70 then @xmath46 for @xmath71 .",
    "in the elliptic and non - resonant case , in order to investigate the stability of the fixed point , we can proceed and examine the first birkhoff coefficient given by ( [ eq : tau1 ] ) .",
    "the complex coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the formula depend on the real coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 of the taylor expansion of @xmath60 at the origin ( [ eq : taylor ] ) .",
    "the linear coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 , are obviously the entries of @xmath77 and thus given by ( [ eq : dt2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath78 . as @xmath4 is area preserving , @xmath79 and , as @xmath27 is elliptic , @xmath80 .",
    "these conditions were used to write down the coordinate change leading to ( [ eq : comp ] ) and we got : syok / papers/2complex . ] @xmath81 which shows that @xmath50 is linear on the real coefficients of third order and quadratic on the second order ones .    in order to calculate explicitly the first birkhoff coefficient , all",
    "is needed now are the second and third order coefficients of the taylor expansion at @xmath27 of @xmath82    a sequence of straightforward but long computations using the chain rule gives those taylor coefficients . to illustrate it ,",
    "let us give the expression of @xmath83 @xmath84 ^ 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 s}{\\partial p^2}(s_1,0)+\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial p}(s_1,0)\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial",
    "s^2}(0,0 ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial s}(0,0)\\right]^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 s}{\\partial s^2}(s_1,0 ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first derivatives of the functions @xmath10 and @xmath12 are given by formulae ( [ eq : deriv]and they depend on the function @xmath14 .",
    "so , to calculate he second and third derivatives of @xmath10 and @xmath12 it is necessary to evaluate the first and second derivatives of @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 .",
    "then @xmath87 .    by differentiating @xmath88",
    "we have @xmath89 and so , as @xmath90 is the unitary tangent vector , @xmath91 analogously @xmath92 these relations simply shows that @xmath93 is the generating function of the billiard map , as a twist map .    differentiating ( [ eq : dl ] ) with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath10 and using that @xmath94 is the unitary normal vector gives @xmath95 the same reasoning gives @xmath96 the chain rule will give , now , the first and second order derivatives of @xmath14 . to evaluate them at @xmath27 and @xmath97",
    "it is usefull to remember that @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    because of the recurrent structure of the formulae , the explicit calculus of the @xmath74 and @xmath75 is suitable to be implemented as a computer program.syok/papers/0threejet and 1taylorcoeffs ] the final expression of the taylor expansion of @xmath60",
    "is also given in the worksheet 1taylorcoeffs .",
    "the second order coefficients @xmath101 will have linear dependence on @xmath102 and @xmath103 while the third order coefficients @xmath104 will have linear dependence on @xmath105 and @xmath106 and quadratic on the first order derivatives .",
    "so the first birkhoff coefficient @xmath50 will be quadratic on the first derivatives of @xmath17 and linear on the second ones .",
    "the final expression of @xmath50 is obtained after substitution of the @xmath74 and @xmath75 into ( [ eq : coef ] ) and then into ( [ eq : tau1 ] ) given @xmath107 the details leading to the formula are given in the worksheet 4tau .",
    "as remarked in section [ sec:3 ] , a billiard on a strictly convex @xmath54 curve always has 2-periodic orbits and the largest one , if isolated , is hyperbolic .",
    "unfortunately , one can not assure that at least one of the others is elliptic .",
    "in fact , there are many examples where all 2-periodic orbits are isolated and hyperbolic ( see , for instance @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , ellipticity is an open property , in the sense that if a billiard associated to a @xmath54 strictly convex curve @xmath0 has an elliptic 2-periodic orbit , then any strictly convex curve sufficiently @xmath54-close to @xmath0 generates a billiard with an elliptic 2-periodic orbit @xcite .",
    "so , a large class of strictly convex billiards has elliptic 2-periodic orbits .",
    "the question is : are they stable ?",
    "our first and simplest example is a 2-periodic orbit between two circles .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be a @xmath41 plane strictly convex closed curve parameterized by the arclength @xmath1 , with the following properties :                  as @xmath0 is locally circles , @xmath4 is locally analytic and the first birkhoff coefficient of the elliptic orbit can be calculated .",
    "moreover , @xmath119 and @xmath120 vanish at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "so , @xmath121 and this billiard has a stable 2-periodic orbit .",
    "although extremely simple , this example shows that exchanging the curve @xmath0 by the osculating circles at the impact points gives information about ellipticity , but not about stability , since @xmath50 depends on the derivatives of the radius of curvature .                      in particular ,",
    "this class of curves include those studied numerically by berry in @xcite and defined by @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",
    "if @xmath142 or @xmath143 , the conditions for non - resonant ellipticity are fullfilled and the 2-periodic orbit is stable .",
    "it is claimed in @xcite that when @xmath144 ( meaning parabolicity of the 2-periodic orbit ) there is neutral stability . there is no specific observations for the other two values of @xmath145 .",
