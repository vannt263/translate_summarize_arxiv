    "such resonant transformation effects have also been studied in the context of photon  axion oscillations  @xcite .    however , the case of photons with different polarization has been ignored until recently when broderick and blandford  @xcite for the first time considered the faraday effect across regions of slow @xmath0field reversal where the dispersion relations of photons with opposite helicities cross over .",
    "if this transition is adiabatic , photons flip their helicity .",
    "the practical astronomical consequence is that the usual rotation measure for photon polarization @xmath1 changes to @xmath2 and thus can build up continuously across regions of opposite field direction .",
    "the adiabaticity condition depends on photon frequency .",
    "comparing the faraday effect at frequencies above and below a certain @xmath3 may allow one to study the geometry of astrophysical magnetic fields .",
    "the main purpose of our paper is to formulate the adiabatic faraday effect in the more familiar language of particle oscillations using a linearized wave equation . in this way the evolution of photon polarization is described by a schrdinger equation for the two - level system consisting of the two photon helicity states . while the underlying physics , of course , is precisely as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , our approach helps to bring out the explicit analogy to neutrino oscillations and therefore allows one to borrow both intuition and results from more familiar cases .",
    "in addition , we recover the nature of faraday rotation at intermediate adiabaticity .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eom ] we derive a two - level schrdinger equation for photon polarizations and identify the condition for adiabatic helicity flipping . in sec .",

    "the evolution of photon polarization , neutrino flavor oscillations , and similar phenomena derive from the underlying wave equation for the relevant fields .",
    "since dispersion plays a central role , it is easiest to assume harmonic time variation @xmath4 for all fields , i.e.  to study the spatial variation of a monochromatic wave . using natural units with @xmath5 ,",
    "one finds a stationary klein - gordon equation of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a `` spinor '' of amplitudes describing the multi - component wave phenomenon . for photon propagation , this is the jones vector formed by the transverse components of the electric field ( appendix  a ) , whereas for neutrinos the wavefunction in flavor space comes into play . for photons",
    ", @xmath8 is the `` polarization tensor , '' whereas for neutrinos , @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the mass matrix that is non - diagonal in the interaction basis .",
    "the problem simplifies further if the waves are relativistic , i.e.@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a typical eigenvalue of @xmath13 or of @xmath8 . in the language of refractive indices ,",
    "the dispersion relation is written as @xmath14 and the relativistic assumption amounts to @xmath15 .",
    "the propagating waves now involve a short length scale ( the wave length ) and a long one corresponding to the phase difference ( the oscillation length ) .",
    "assuming propagation in the @xmath16direction , one can easily separate the fast and slow variation by the nominal substitution  @xcite @xmath17 where we have used @xmath18 in one of the terms .",
    "this approximation replaces the klein - gordon equation with a linear equation @xmath19 moreover , we are not interested in the overall phase of the wave , but only in phase differences between different components . therefore , on the r.h.s .  we may drop terms that are proportional to the unit matrix and find @xmath20 the `` hamiltonian '' is @xmath21 .",
    "sometimes eq .  ( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) is written in terms of a parameter `` time , '' playing the role of an affine parameter along the trajectory .",
    "the linear wave equation then manifestly resembles a schrdinger equation for a two - level system such as a spin evolving in a magnetic field .",
    "we stress , however , that eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) is a _ classical _ equation . using natural units",
    "somewhat obscures that @xmath22 does not appear anyway , at least not when considering the variation of photon polarization along a trajectory .",
    "the analogy to a schrdinger equation reveals that the linear wave equation provides for unitary evolution along the beam , i.e. , any photon that disappears from one polarization state must appear in another .",
    "linearizing the wave equation has removed such physical effects as reflection by inhomogeneities or discontinuities of the medium . in the context of neutrino physics",
    "such effects are always vanishingly small , except perhaps near a supernova core , whereas for photons near propagation threshold , polarization - dependent reflection effects may play a nontrivial role .",
    "likewise , the wave may suffer deflection caused by density variations in the transverse direction .",
    "therefore , the requirement that all polarization components follow the same trajectory with sufficient precision poses nontrivial constraints  @xcite .",
    "typically , relativistic propagation will be required because near propagation threshold the refractive indices between different components are largest and the differential deflection of different polarization states would be largest",
    ".    the connection between a classical two - level equation and a true quantum equation as well as the precise role of the relativistic approximation will be explored elsewhere .",
    "here we simply take advantage of the formal equivalence of our problem with a two - level quantum system .      photon dispersion in a cold collisionless plasma with electron density @xmath23 and weak external magnetic field @xmath24",
    "is determined by the plasma frequency and cyclotron frequency that are respectively are almost always employed , whereas in the context of plasma physics and photon propagation , unrationalized units corresponding to @xmath25 are used , assuming @xmath5 in both cases . we follow the particle - physics tradition and note that a magnetic field of 1  gauss then corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "the critical field strength , defined by @xmath27 , is then correctly found as @xmath28 . ]",
    "@xmath29 where the elementary charge @xmath30 was taken to be positive .",
    "the analogous contributions from ions are much smaller and will be neglected .",
    "we decompose @xmath24 into a longitudinal component @xmath31 along the direction of propagation ( @xmath16direction ) and a transverse one @xmath32 .",
    "the impact of the magnetic field is determined by the dimensionless parameters @xmath33 propagating modes exist only if ( appendix a ) @xmath34 the assumption that we are dealing with relativistic waves thus implies that @xmath35 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the evolution of photon polarization is found to be ( appendix a ) @xmath36 where we have dropped terms proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "we have used the helicity basis , i.e.  the components of the spinor @xmath7 are the amplitudes of the two circular polarization components of the wave .",
    "the angle @xmath37 describes the direction of @xmath38 relative to a fixed direction transverse to the photon trajectory .    to linear order in @xmath0 ,",
    "the matrix @xmath39 is always diagonal and even if @xmath0 changes or reverses along the trajectory , nothing new happens .",
    "photons that begin linearly polarized stay that way , except that their plane of polarization rotates by an angle proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , we had to include the quadratic terms , responsible for the cotton - mouton effect .",
    "it is these terms that can flip the photon helicity .",
    "the same conclusion is reached by observing that a longitudinal @xmath0field is symmetric relative to rotations around the @xmath16direction .",
    "therefore , angular momentum along @xmath16 is conserved and a longitudinal @xmath0field can not induce transitions between photons of opposite helicity .",
    "this can be achieved only by the transverse field . by the same token",
    ", transverse fields are required to achieve mixing with spin-0 particles such neutral pions or axions or with spin-2 particles such as gravitons .",
    "if photons propagate in the presence of a purely transverse @xmath0field , the cotton - mouton effect provides a refractive difference between the modes that are linearly polarized parallel and orthogonal to the field .",
    "a photon that is initially circularly polarized will acquire elliptic polarization , eventually reverse its helicity , and later return to the initial polarization in the spirit of an oscillation phenomenon .",
    "however , a realistic situation is different .",
    "astrophysical magnetic fields are not homogeneous and vary in magnitude and direction along any given photon path . in the relativistic limit where @xmath35 , the refractive effect of @xmath31 is much larger than that of @xmath32 because the faraday effect is linear in @xmath0 , the cotton - mouton effect quadratic .",
    "therefore , almost everywhere the `` mass difference '' of photons with opposite helicity is large compared with the mixing energy provided by the transverse field . in other words , the unitary transformation between helicity and propagation eigenstates involves a small mixing angle .",
    "however , @xmath31 may vanish somewhere and may reverse while @xmath32 remains at a typical value . at the @xmath31 inversion point",
    "the helicity eigenstates become degenerate and their effective masses cross over , except for the small perturbation provided by the transverse field .",
    "it prevents an actual crossing of the eigenvalues and leads to an adiabatic helicity reversal in the spirit of the msw effect .    within the landau - zener approximation  @xcite , the probability for the state to _ jump _ over the avoided level crossing while preserving its helicity is @xmath41 the adiabaticity parameter @xmath42 compares the rate - of - change of the energy splitting with the oscillation frequency . when the unperturbed levels would cross ( here the @xmath31 reversal ) , one finds the usual result @xmath43 where a prime denotes @xmath44 . in our case",
    "this is @xmath45 where we have used that at a @xmath46 reversal @xmath47 and therefore @xmath48 .",
    "we have also introduced the length scale of @xmath0-variation @xmath49 . if the magnitude @xmath0 is fixed so that @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 the angle between photon direction and @xmath24 , we find @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , using cycle frequencies @xmath54 , we find that the upper @xmath55 limit given in eq .  ( 6 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds in our treatment to @xmath56 . in other words",
    ", @xmath56 defines a critical frequency @xmath57 such that we are in the adiabatic regime for @xmath58 and in the nonadiabatic regime for @xmath59 .",
    "the landau - zener approximation is strictly applicable only when @xmath60 decreases linearly and certain other conditions are met  @xcite .",
    "there is however substantial literature on its refinements  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the `` double exponential '' ansatz parameterizes the jump probability in a more widely applicable way  @xcite",
    ". we will continue to use the landau - zener formula for its simplicity , but our discussion proceeds unaltered if one substitutes a more accurate expression .",
    "thus far we assumed that the transverse @xmath0field points in a fixed direction , but of course this direction changes on the same length scale @xmath61 as all other properties .",
    "this may have interesting consequences  @xcite .",
    "however , in the adiabatic approximation , @xmath0field twisting is slow compared with the oscillation length and thus would not produce new effects .",
    "rapid twisting would lead to non - adiabatic transitions .",
    "the @xmath0field may have other variations , for example fast variations caused by turbulence .",
    "the evolution of photon polarization in such circumstances could be performed on the level of our schrdinger equation . both for solar and supernova neutrino oscillations",
    "it was found that relatively small density fluctuations of the medium can severely affect the msw effect  @xcite .",
    "similar phenomena for radio waves are expected and would be an interesting subject of study .",
    "we now investigate the role of adiabatic helicity flips on the rotation of linearly polarized radiation traversing a region of magnetized plasma . if we begin with @xmath62 at the source , at the detector we will have @xmath63 the unitary matrix taking the initial to the final state is @xmath64 where the hamiltonian in the helicity basis is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath37 all depend on @xmath16 . at different locations the matrices @xmath67 and @xmath68 do not in general commute , so the exponential is understood in the space - ordering convention symbolized by @xmath69 . note that we work in the helicity basis . however ,",
    "if photons are produced and detected in regions that do not involve large transverse fields , the helicity states are identical to the propagation states at source and detector .",
    "thus oscillatory terms depending on the mixing angle at source and detector , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , will vanish .    in the extreme case when the transverse field @xmath32 is either zero or so small that it plays no role , @xmath39 is always diagonal and one finds explicitly @xmath70 with the phase @xmath71 the two helicity states pick up equal but opposite phases , implying that the plane of polarization rotates by the angle @xmath72 : the usual faraday effect .",
    "however , the polarization direction at the source is not known , so the measurable quantity is the variation of @xmath72 with frequency .",
    "this `` rotation measure '' is @xmath73 where @xmath74 has been used , with @xmath75 being the wavelength .",
    "rm itself does not depend on frequency .      in order to understand the impact of an adiabatic helicity flip we subdivide @xmath76 into several pieces . to be specific",
    "we assume a single @xmath0-field reversal .",
    "the propagation up to somewhat before this point is described by the ordinary faraday effect .",
    "the same is true after the reversal onwards .",
    "therefore , the overall effect is @xmath77 with @xmath78 the phases are given by ordinary faraday integrals on path  1 , leading from the source to the reversal , and path  2 , leading from the reversal to the detector . if the reversal is non - adiabatic , @xmath79 is the unit matrix and we recover the previous result : @xmath80 .",
    "on the other hand , if the reversal is perfectly adiabatic it has the effect of exchanging the left- and right - handed helicity states @xmath81 in general , an additional relative phase arises  we will be more precise later .",
    "the flip matrix implies @xmath82 if the initial linear polarization state is @xmath83 the non - adiabatic ( na ) and adiabatic ( ad ) final states are @xmath84 the impact of the second part of the trajectory is the same in both cases : the helicity components acquire a relative phase @xmath85 , whereas the impact of the first part is reversed .",
    "the overall rotation of linear polarization is @xmath86 in other words , the adiabatic helicity flip has the effect of reversing the rotation measure accrued on the path before the flip .",
    "this is physically understood : the helicity states in terms of electric fields are @xmath87 . exchanging helicities amounts to @xmath88 and thus reverses the polarization angle relative to the @xmath89direction .",
    "-field orientation .",
    "the ordinary ( non - adiabatic ) and adiabatic cases are shown.[fig : bfields ] ]    we juxtapose the non - adiabatic and adiabatic evolution of rm in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfields ] that is analogous to fig .  2 of ref .",
    "an important difference is that for the adiabatic case these authors actually show the evolution of the phase difference between the two propagation eigenmodes , a quantity that indeed always increases .",
    "however , the only observable quantity is the rm .",
    "it acquires a minus sign at each adiabatic reversal and thus jumps by a large amount .",
    "the overall adiabatic rm is @xmath90 the absolute sign is identical with the sign of @xmath31 on the last sub  trajectory .",
    "the final polarization of the beam depends crucially on the degree of adiabaticity .",
    "the entire effect of the reversal is parameterized in the flip matrix . in general",
    ", @xmath79 is given by a unitary matrix @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the probability to jump between helicities at the crossing .",
    "note the presence of other phases acquired at the reversal .",
    "the non - adiabatic limit is obtained for @xmath94 with other phases set to zero .",
    "similarly the adiabatic limit is obtained for @xmath95 , which is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adflip ] ) for overall phase choices @xmath96 .",
    "if the initial linear polarization state is @xmath83 , the final state ( up to an overall phase ) is @xmath97 the intensity of the left and right helicity components of this state are @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a combination of the phases acquired at the reversal .    at the fully adiabatic or fully non - adiabatic limit ,",
    "@xmath100 and the two helicities arrive with equal intensity : the beam is linearly polarized . at intermediate adiabaticity",
    "this is no longer true and the final beam is elliptically polarized to a degree depending on frequency . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : wcrit ] ) , we find @xmath101\\;,\\ ] ] whereas from eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) we find that @xmath102 varies as @xmath103 , the integral extending from the source to the point of reversal .",
    "the degree of elliptical polarization thus has two variations imprinted upon it as a function of frequency .",
    "one arises from the usual rm accrued between source and field reversal which determines the orientation with which the linear polarization enters the cross - over region .",
    "the other is a slow variation determined by the jump probability as a function of frequency , approximately given by the landau - zener formula .",
    "if one could measure the polarization state over a reasonably broad range of frequencies , a measure of @xmath0field tomography would become possible . unlike the adiabatic or non - adiabatic limit , at intermediate adiabaticity one has the opportunity to probe the magnetic fields in specific segments of the path traveled .",
    "we have mostly confined our discussion to a single field reversal , but the formalism is easily extended to multiple reversals . as emphasized by broderick and blandford , the ordinary faraday effect for @xmath104 domains ,",
    "each causing a rotation @xmath105 , adds up to @xmath106 on the other hand , the adiabatic faraday effect leads to a rotation by @xmath107 clearly , for media with multiple reversals this leads to a larger faraday rotation at adiabatic frequencies .    for quasi - adiabatic frequencies , multiple reversals",
    "lead to loss of linear polarization by each of the reversals .",
    "schematically , for @xmath108 domains with @xmath109 field reversals , the intensities of the helicity components arriving at the detector is @xmath110 where we have ignored the fast oscillatory terms .",
    "clearly , there is increased elliptic polarization at the critical frequencies corresponding to each of the magnetic field reversal .",
    "a more precise prediction , including interference effects due to the oscillatory terms , can be calculated using the recipe prescribed in ref .",
    "we have studied the adiabatic faraday effect that was recently discovered by broderick and blandford .",
    "we have used a simple formalism that linearizes the photon klein - gordon equation and amounts to a schrdinger equation for a two - level system consisting of the photon helicities .",
    "this approach is commonplace in the context of neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "once the photon dispersion relation has been identified , the adiabaticity condition follows immediately from well - known textbook results such as the landau - zener approximation . formulating the adiabatic faraday effect in a language familiar from neutrino physics",
    "may allow for a broader appreciation of this intriguing `` msw effect for photons . ''    despite the similarities , faraday rotation also has important differences with neutrino oscillations .",
    "for neutrinos , the initial states are always weak - interaction eigenstates , whereas photons can in general be produced in any polarization state . during propagation ,",
    "neutrinos typically have non - maximal mixing except on the msw resonance , causing large flavor transitions . for photons , the plane of polarization is typically rotated by many full cycles independently of any transverse field .",
    "therefore , the adiabatic helicity flip does not enhance the transition between linear polarization states , it modifies the rotation measure , the way the rotation of the plane of polarization varies with frequency . finally , unlike a neutrino detector , a photon detector in the radio band has the capability of identifying not merely the intensities of each polarization state , but also the relative phase between them .",
    "so the observational manifestation of the msw effect is rather different for neutrinos and photons .    to summarize , the adiabatic faraday effect is the process of photon helicity getting flipped adiabatically in regions of slow @xmath0-field reversal , and has the effect of reversing the rotation measure accrued by the photon up to that point on its trajectory .",
    "therefore , the subsequent faraday effect goes effectively in the same direction as the faraday effect before the reversal region , giving much larger overall rotation measure .",
    "the global sign of the rotation measure depends only on the @xmath0field direction on the last leg of the photon path .",
    "the rotation measure both in the adiabatic and non - adiabatic regime is independent of frequency .",
    "observations over a broad range of frequencies , ranging from below to above the critical frequency , would reveal a transition range of fast modulations of elliptic polarization . in the adiabatic regime",
    ", similar variations can arise in the transverse direction across the sky .",
    "the astronomical potential of these effects for @xmath0field tomography has been explored by broderick and blandford .",
    "the main purpose of our note was to clarify the basic principles of the adiabatic faraday effect that is a neat application of the formalism usually applied to the msw effect in neutrino oscillations .",
    "after our manuscript had gone to press , d.  melrose circulated a preprint  @xcite , claiming that the adiabatic modification of the faraday effect was not observable .",
    "we believe that underlying this critique is a misunderstanding .",
    "we fully agree with the formalism used by melrose .",
    "our complex two - spinor @xmath7 is equivalent to a @xmath111 density matrix @xmath112 and our eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) can be written as a commutator equation in the form @xmath113 $ ] . moreover ,",

    "in particular , we agree , that @xmath122 is invariant and that @xmath123 is an adiabatic invariant if @xmath121 changes slowly as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "a precessing spin following a slowly changing @xmath0-field is the usual visualization of adiabatic neutrino oscillations .",
    "the adiabatic limit is defined by the oscillation length being shorter than the length scale of field reversal , implying that the position angle ( pa ) of linearly polarized light must undergo many faraday revolutions between source and detector .",
    "therefore , we agree that pa , being measurable only modulo @xmath124 , carries no information about the difference between normal and adiabatic faraday effect .",
    "this information is contained in how quickly pa changes with frequency , i.e.  the rotation measure ( rm ) . in our fig .",
