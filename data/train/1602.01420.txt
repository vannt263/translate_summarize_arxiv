    "this study of bidirectional ( two - way ) teleportation ( together with the first protocol for continuous variables teleportation ) has been initiated by the scheme in ref .",
    "a direct way for bidirectional quantum teleportation is to use two quantum teleportations with two bell states : from alice to bob and vice versa . a number of alternative approaches to bidirectional quantum teleportation based on @xmath5-qubit entangled states with @xmath6 @xcite and ghz states @xcite has been suggested .",
    "our approach is different from that mentioned above in two points .",
    "first , our protocol occupies the minimal amount of shared entangled qubits , _",
    "i.e. _ , a singe bell state pair .",
    "second , the fee for such utilization of shared entanglement is that bidirectional transmission of quantum states becomes imperfect and only noisy versions of input states can be obtained at the output .",
    "bidirectional teleportation with a single bell state can be interesting both from the fundamental viewpoint , since it uncovers the additional potentialities of shared entanglement , and from practical perspectives because experimental control for bell states is on a higher level than for many - qubit states .",
    "we study three schemes for implementation of bidirectional quantum teleportation with a single bell state and auxiliary two - level quantum systems ( trigger qubits ) , whose initial states control the workflow of the schemes .",

    "the third one is a mixture between first and second schemes and can be considered as having tunable level of classical correlation between trigger qubits on both sides .",
    "an important benchmark for imperfect quantum teleportation to ensure that the resource of quantum entanglement is utilized is to require the following inequality for the teleportation fidelity : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the maximal fidelity that can be achieved by means of classical communication only  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the fidelity of teleportation for all schemes and find a minimal amount of correlation between trigger qubits , which allows the classical fidelity boundary to be overcome ( as will be shown the scheme with independent trigger qubits fails to simultaneously achieve @xmath9 in both directions ) .    the fact that appearing quantum channels belong to the class of depolarizing ones also allows us to employ the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism  @xcite to study how classical capacity  @xcite , entanglement - assisted capacity  @xcite , and the entanglement breaking property  @xcite of the suggested teleportation channels relate to the auxiliary classical information responsible for forming correlations between trigger qubits .",

    "-4 mm    the standard one - qubit quantum teleportation protocol works as follows .",
    "the idea is to transfer the state @xmath10 from one party ( alice ) to another ( bob ) .",
    "before protocol start , alice and bob share two particles of a maximally entangled pair .",
    "we consider one of the bell states @xmath11 the protocol consists of three steps : ( i ) alice performs a projective measurement in the bell basis of her particle in the state @xmath10 and the particle from the entangled pair ; ( ii ) alice sends the index of the measurement outcome ( that is 2 bits of information ) to bob through an ideal classical communication channel ; ( iii ) bob performs the particular unitary operation , which depends on message from alice , on his particle from the entangled pair to obtain it in the state @xmath10 .",
    "we note that alice s measurement in the first step of the protocol breaks an initial entanglement of state ( [ eq : bellstate ] ) , and her particle from the entangled pair transforms to a maximally mixed state . besides , bob has to minimize an interaction of his particle from the entangled pair with an environment to avoid decoherence that reduces the fidelity of the quantum information transfer .",
    "these two points indicate that , to make it possible to transfer information from bob to alice as well as from alice to bob , _",
    "i.e. _ , make teleportation bidirectional , alice should not perform a perfect projective measurement of her particles .",
    "indeed , alice should leave some correlations of the bell state for the purpose of information transfer in the reverse direction .",
    "bob should be guided by the same strategy to obtain the quantum state from alice and , at the same time , send his own one .",
    "below , we describe possible schemes for bidirectional quantum teleportation with two random trigger qubits , single random trigger qubits , and a mixture between these two schemes .",
    "the suggested method of entanglement utilization results in imperfections of the transmitted states .",
    "in other words , teleportation fidelities are less than unity .",
    "nevertheless , in such a scheme the fidelity of teleportation can be high enough for applications in quantum information technologies .",
    "we also note that the scheme operates with @xmath12 qubits ; however , these qubits should be prepared locally for two parties without need to be transferred .",
    "this looks realistic in the view of recent experimental advances in operating with multiqubit systems @xcite .",
    "the idea of the first scheme is based on two independent random trigger qubits that guide the actions of alice and bob .",
    "the scheme operates with @xmath12 qubits as it is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : telschemes]a .",
    "here qubits with subindices @xmath13 and @xmath14 belong to alice and bob correspondingly .",

    "( ii ) trigger qubit @xmath58 can belong to the third independent party ( charlie ) and its random value can be transmitted via a classical channel to alice and bob .",

    "this scheme can be considered as intermediate between two limiting situation : the first one with two parties acting independently from each other , and the second one with the two parties acting in complete correlation to obtain a constructive result . in this way ,",

    "one can also see that the channels become entanglement breaking at the point @xmath123 , where the fidelity of teleportation reaches the classical boundary .",
    "this behavior can be explained by the fact that any entanglement breaking channel can be expressed as a measure - and - prepare channel which consists of intermediate stage where all information is encoded as a classical state  @xcite . in our case , this stage corresponds to classical communication between parties .",

    "we suggested several approaches to implement a bidirectional version of the standard one - qubit teleportation protocol with the use of a single bell state : with two independent quantum random trigger qubits , with one random trigger qubit , and mixture between the first and second approaches .",
    "we demonstrated that it is possible to achieve a regime of overcoming the classical fidelity boundary of @xmath71 for teleportation channels in both directions , and showed how the auxiliary classical communication , using for establishing correlations between trigger qubits , amplifies the capacities of the resulting quantum channels .",

    "<S> we present a bidirectional modification of the standard one - qubit teleportation protocol , where both alice and bob transfer noisy versions of their qubit states to each other by using single bell state and auxiliary ( trigger ) qubits . </S>",
    "<S> three schemes are considered : the first , where the actions of parties are governed by two independent quantum random triggers , the second with single random trigger , and the third as a mixture of the first two . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the fidelities of teleportation for all schemes and find a condition on correlation between trigger qubits in the mixed scheme which allows us to overcome the classical fidelity boundary of 2/3 . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism to the quantum channels obtained in order to investigate an interplay between their ability to transfer the information , entanglement breaking property , and auxiliary classical communication needed to form correlations between trigger qubits . </S>",
