    "the general procedure described previously can be straightforwardly applied to the @xmath3-@xmath4 model when accounting for quantum fluctuations over the sf ground state .",
    "it becomes lengthy and tedious , however , when the ground state is the csf .",
    "for this reason , we will work within the hmft@xmath49@xmath48@xmath287 framework described above , and show that it is exactly equivalent to the usual procedure , although more advantageous when treating hamiltonians with complex many - body interacting terms . for the particular case of 1@xmath481 , the cb mapping ( [ cmap ] ) is equivalent to the schwinger boson mapping in the bosonic language .",
    "first , let us express hamiltonian @xmath21 in terms of schwinger bosons @xmath288 , which create ( annihilate ) an empty ( 0 ) or occupied ( 1 ) state at site @xmath10 of the original lattice , @xmath289 where we have added the physical constraint , @xmath290 , via a lagrange multiplier @xmath162 , playing the role of an effective chemical potential . the relevant quantum fluctuations accounted for by the lswt and which lead to low - lying excitations of the classical ground states reside in the space orthogonal to the one determined by the classical solution at each site of the lattice",
    "let us re - express hamiltonian ( [ jkcb ] ) in a new basis in which the ground state is enconded in one flavor @xmath191 and the orthogonal space in the other @xmath291 . as seen before",
    ", the csf has a two - sublattice structure where the azimuth angle of the pseudospin takes the values @xmath292 depending on the sublattice .",
    "therefore , the canonical transformation among the new cbs has to include this information about the ground state , @xmath293 where @xmath224 takes just two values @xmath157 and @xmath294 , and @xmath295 .",
    "we know from sec .",
    "[ clasphasediag ] that its explicit form is @xmath296 where the first column @xmath297 , accounts for the classical solution ( [ prod_wf ] ) and the second column @xmath298 accounts for the orthogonal space .",
    "applying transformations ( [ rota ] ) and ( [ rotb ] ) to the hamiltonian ( [ jkcb ] ) , @xmath299 where @xmath300 are unit vectors , @xmath301 involves a sum over @xmath302 in the second line , and @xmath301 @xmath303 a sum over @xmath304 @xmath305 in the third line .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath306 , @xmath307 and @xmath308 contain all the information about the original hamiltonian ( [ jk ] ) and the classical ground state .",
    "these matrix elements are explicitly given by @xmath309 by construction , they `` keep memory '' of the bipartite nature of the csf ground state and they are therefore link - dependent .      in this new basis , the csf product wave function ( [ prod_wf ] ) can be rewritten in a form similar to ( [ hmftwf ] ) ( @xmath310 ) , @xmath311 the expectation value of ( [ cbh ] ) with this wave function is the classical energy ( [ e_clas ] ) , which expressed in terms of the matrix elements @xmath312 can be written in the following compact form , @xmath313 where @xmath314 is the number of sites on sublattice @xmath36 ( half of the original lattice ) .",
    "it will be computationally convenient to cast the variational equations in the hartree matrix form ( [ diag_hartree ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , we can rewrite the unitary transformation ( [ u ] ) as @xmath315 & -y\\left[z_{\\mathrm r}+{\\mathrm i}z_{\\mathrm i}\\right]\\\\ y\\left[z_{\\mathrm r}-{\\mathrm i}z_{\\mathrm i}\\right ] & x\\left[z_{\\mathrm r}-{\\mathrm i}z_{\\mathrm i}\\right ] \\end{array}\\right),\\label{grot}\\ ] ] where @xmath316 , and compute derivatives with respect to the variational parameters , @xmath317 , under the unitarity constraint .",
    "we split the _ amplitude _ @xmath318 and _ phase _ @xmath319 parts for computational convenience .",
    "the hartree equation therefore reduces to two coupled matrix equations @xmath320 where @xmath321 , @xmath322 , and @xmath323 is a lagrange multiplier enforcing @xmath324 .",
    "note that @xmath162 works as a chemical potential which fixes to unity the total density of the schwinger boson system , while @xmath323 has no physical relevance .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath325 is @xmath326 where @xmath327 , while @xmath328 is given by @xmath329 with matrix elements @xmath330      to compute the lswt corrections to the energy and find the magnon dispersion relations over each classical ground state , we apply the hp transformation to the bosonic hamiltonian ( [ cbh ] ) .",
    "as we have already expressed it in terms of the ground state @xmath191 and its orthogonal space @xmath291 , the hp transformation simply reads @xcite @xmath331 the hp bosons @xmath332 obey standard canonical commutation relations .",
    "assuming that the fluctuations over the classical ground state are small , one can expand the hamiltonian up to terms quadratic in the hp bosons and then fourier transform , @xmath333     left : classical energy ( black ) and lswt energy ( gray ) for @xmath93 across the sf - csf second order phase transition .",
    "right : @xmath334 ( gray ) and @xmath335 ( black ) bogoliubov modes across the same transition . ]    where we keep track of the two sublattices by adding a tilde for sublattice @xmath68 .",
    "the first brillouin zone ( @xmath336 ) , is defined as a square with vertices @xmath337 and @xmath338 .",
    "finally , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath339 , where the second order part of the hamiltonian can be cast in matrix form @xcite , @xmath340 where we have defined @xmath341 and @xmath342 and @xmath343 are @xmath344 matrices with components @xmath345 where @xmath346 and @xmath347    note that @xmath348 and @xmath349 . expression ( [ h2 ] ) can be diagonalized by a bogoliubov transformation , @xmath350 , leading to a bogoliubov eigenvalue equation of the form@xcite , @xmath351 where sw dispersion relations are given by the two positive bogoliubov eigenvalues , @xmath352 .",
    "note that @xmath353 and @xmath354 are @xmath248 matrices .",
    "the lswt correction to the classical energy is simply , @xmath355    in fig .",
    "[ swmu0 ] we show the computed sw correction to the energy for the sf - csf transition at @xmath93 .",
    "we observe that the transition becomes first order when adding the sw corrections , as we can distinguish a clear discontinuity in the first derivative of the energy .",
    "note that the transition point is still placed at the very same value as it was in the classical approach , that is , at @xmath124 .",
    "both the sf and the csf are gapless @xmath356 and have a finite value of the @xmath335 excitation mode , which vanishes continuously at the critical point .",
    "note that within the uniform sf phase , this @xmath335 mode would correspond to the @xmath79 one - band sw dispersion mode , have not we performed a bipartition of the lattice ."
