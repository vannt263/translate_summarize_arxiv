    "the evolution of the phase - space density of stars in galaxies is determined by the collisionless boltzmann equation , which states that phase - space flow is incompressible .",
    "thus a cloud of stars in phase space becomes more and more distorted as it evolves ; the local or fine - grained density around any point in phase space remains the same , but the coarse - grained density evolves towards a stationary state .",
    "this process , known as phase mixing , is the principal mechanism by which stellar systems reach coarse - grained equilibrium .",
    "the standard analogy is stirring a glass containing 20% rum and 80% coke ; eventually every finite volume element in the glass contains 20% rum and 80% coke , even though infinitesimal volume elements are either 100% rum or 100% coke ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies are not thoroughly phase - mixed , since they are at most a few dynamical times old in their outer parts , and since mergers and star formation continuously add new stars .",
    "there is a variety of direct observational evidence for incomplete phase mixing : ( i ) sharp - edged features ( `` shells '' ) in the outer parts of at least 10% of elliptical galaxies are believed to arise from the recent tidal disruption of small galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( ii ) proper - motion and radial - velocity surveys of the local halo reveal clumping in phase space ( @xcite ) .",
    "( iii ) the tidally disrupted sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( @xcite ) provides a concrete example of a cloud in the early stages of phase mixing .",
    "( iv ) moving groups in the solar neighborhood may result from dissolution and mixing of star clusters and associations ( @xcite ) .",
    "incomplete phase mixing is likely to play a growing role in the interpretation of observations , for several reasons : radial - velocity and proper - motion surveys are rapidly improving in size and quality ; large telescopes with improved image quality will permit us to examine the surface - brightness structure of elliptical galaxies with high spatial resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ; the hipparcos mission has dramatically improved the precision of measurements of the phase - space distribution of stars in the solar neighborhood , and future space - based astrometric missions such as sim and gaia will provide proper - motion and parallax measurements over much of the galaxy ; and the sloan digital sky survey will soon provide a stellar database of unprecedented size and uniformity ( @xmath3 stars with five - color photometry ) .",
    "virtually all theoretical descriptions of phase mixing have focused on mixing in a two - dimensional phase space , which is the simplest to visualize ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mix ] ) .",
    "this paper discusses some of the geometrical features of partially phase - mixed systems ( we shall call these `` phase structures '' ) with higher dimensionality , and the projection of this geometry into the observables that are measured in a survey .",
    "we shall argue that this geometry can be organized by two integers : the dimension of the phase structure and the dimension of the survey .",
    "a cloud of stars orbiting in an integrable potential ( the `` host galaxy '' ) can be viewed as a surface or manifold of dimension @xmath4 embedded in @xmath5-dimensional phase space ( usually @xmath6 ) .",
    "for example , a cold disk has @xmath7 ( the disk occupies a two - dimensional surface in configuration space , and the velocity at each position is unique ) , collisionless cold dark matter has @xmath8 ( three spatial dimensions but zero random velocity ) , and a hot galaxy has @xmath9 . since real stellar systems always have non - zero thickness and velocity dispersion , we are referring to an `` effective '' or `` coarse - grained '' dimension ; loosely speaking , a structure in a phase space of @xmath5 dimensions has effective dimension @xmath0 if its extent in @xmath0 independent directions is much larger than its extent in the other @xmath10 directions .",
    "because the flow of the cloud through phase space is incompressible , the dimension of the manifold does not change in the initial stages of phase mixing , although the shape of the manifold becomes more and more complicated .",
    "however , the effective dimension can change over longer times , through several distinct processes .",
    "the most obvious is that the phase - mixing scale grows smaller and smaller with time ( see figure [ fig : mix ] ) , and eventually becomes smaller than the coarse - graining scale . at this point",
    "the phase structure has the same ( coarse - grained ) dimension as the phase space , unless all of the stars in the cloud have the same value of one or more isolating integrals of the motion .",
    "gravitational scattering by small - scale irregularities ( e.g. massive objects ) can also lead to diffusion of the phase structure and an increase in effective dimension .",
    "less obviously , phase mixing can also _ decrease _ the number of effective dimensions .",
    "for example , consider the cloud resulting from the disruption of a small hot galaxy .",
    "the motion of the stars in the cloud can be described by a hamiltonian @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are action - angle variables in the host potential .",
    "the equations of motion are = , = h ( ) ( ) . the trajectory of the centroid of the cloud is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is approximately the location of the center of the satellite at the disruption time @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , the trajectory of a star in the cloud is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this can be simplified to ( ( t),(t))=(_c , _",
    "c(t))+(,+t)+o(,)^2 , [ eq : hess ] where h_ik=^2 h(_0)/j_ij_k [ eq : hhh ] is the hessian of the hamiltonian . at large times",
    "the extent of the cloud is dominated by the terms @xmath20 in equation ( [ eq : hess ] ) , so we may write approximately ( t)_0+o ( ) , ( t)_c(t)+t+o ( ) .",
    "[ eq : hessa ] since @xmath21 is symmetric , it is diagonalizable , that is , there exists an orthogonal matrix @xmath22 such that ^-1= ( ) , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the eigenvalues of @xmath21 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we now make a canonical transformation to new action - angle variables @xmath26 using the mixed generating function @xmath27 ; thus =s= , = s=^t , = ^t , =. equation ( [ eq : hessa ] ) now simplifies to j_i(t)j_0i+o(j ) , w_i(t)w_ci(t)+_ij_i t+o(w ) .",
    "[ eq : hessb ]    this result shows that the shape of the expanding cloud is largely determined by the eigenvalues @xmath28 of the hessian @xmath21 , which are invariant under the orthogonal transformation @xmath22 .",
    "if two of the three eigenvalues are zero ( say @xmath29 ) then the cloud expands only along the @xmath30 direction in phase space , yielding a one - dimensional tidal streamer that grows linearly with time .",
    "if one of the eigenvalues is zero ( say @xmath31 ) then the cloud expands in two dimensions in phase space .",
    "however , if in addition @xmath32 or vice versa , then the expansion will effectively be one - dimensional .",
    "thus the dimension @xmath0 has been reduced from 6 to 1 or 2 , because the cloud expands much faster in some angles than in others , and not at all in action space .",
    "we illustrate these remarks with some examples .",
    "the hamiltonian for the triaxial harmonic oscillator may be written @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the frequency along axis @xmath35 .",
    "the hessian for this hamiltonian is zero , so the disrupted system does not expand at all : the frequencies are independent of the actions and phase mixing does not occur .",
    "the hamiltonian for the kepler potential is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the semi - major axis .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hessian are @xmath39 , so the expanded cloud is one - dimensional , even if its original state was 6-dimensional",
    ". simulations of disruptions of small galaxies in a spherical logarithmic potential yield one - dimensional clouds as well ( @xcite ) , but the precise conditions determining the effective dimension of the cloud resulting from tidal disruption of a small stellar system have not yet been studied .",
    "we now survey the phase space by measuring @xmath1 of the @xmath5 phase - space coordinates of each star ( we call this @xmath1-dimensional space the `` observable space '' ) , and ask how to detect the @xmath0-dimensional phase structure . for example , an image or set of sky positions has @xmath40 ; a data cube ( positions and radial velocities ) has @xmath41 ; a proper - motion survey has @xmath42 , etc .",
    "a bolometric laboratory detector of cold dark matter measures only their energy and moreover is restricted to a single point in configuration space .    if @xmath43 the phase structure will appear as a distinct entity in the observable space , which can be detected by standard techniques : plotting the data on paper ( @xmath40 ) , visualization software ( @xmath41 ) , cluster - finding algorithms , etc .",
    "more specialized and powerful techniques can be used if the phase structure has known properties : for example , the disruption of distant satellite galaxies in a spherical potential leads to phase structures which are great circles on the sky ( @xcite ) .    in this discussion",
    "we concentrate the more challenging case when @xmath44 , so that the phase structure covers most or all of the observable space . in this case ,",
    "the most prominent features in the survey will be the singularities of the phase structure , that is , the locations where the projection of the phase structure into the observable space leads to a singularity .",
    "for example , if in figure [ fig : mix ] the observations yield only the horizontal coordinate , then near - singularities arise in the plot at @xmath45 when the curve representing the phase structure is vertical .",
    "we can generalize this simple concept to singularities with higher dimension using catastrophe theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by setting up a coordinate system @xmath46 on the phase structure that contains the cloud .",
    "we complete the coordinate system of the phase space by @xmath47 , which are chosen so that @xmath48 on the phase structure",
    ". thus the phase structure is specified by = 0 , j=1,  ,n ( * u*)=_j = d+1^n u_j^2 . the advantage of specifying the phase structure in terms of the generating function @xmath49 is that @xmath49 is a single - valued function of the phase - space coordinates .",
    "next let @xmath50 be the coordinates of the observable space , and complete the coordinate system of the phase space by @xmath51 ( we call this @xmath52-dimensional space the `` hidden space '' ) . for given values of the observable coordinates , the location or locations of the phase structure",
    "are specified implicitly by the equations = 0 , j=1,  ,n - d .",
    "[ eq : sing ] singularities in the observable space arise when there are displacements in the hidden space that leave ( [ eq : sing ] ) unaltered , that is , for which _ k=1^n - d^2(;)y_jy_kdx_k=0 , j=1,  ,n - d .",
    "these equations have a non - trivial solution if the determinant of the @xmath53 hessian matrix vanishes , that is , if = 0 .",
    "[ eq : hessmat ]    we can restrict our attention to structurally stable singularities ( roughly speaking , ones for which small changes in @xmath49 lead to small changes in the locus of the singularity ) ;",
    "the reason is that unstable singularities represent a subset of measure zero and hence are atypical , at least for @xmath54 ( @xcite ) .",
    "catastrophes are structurally stable singularities of gradient maps .",
    "they are classified by their codimension , which is the dimension of the observable space minus the dimension of the singularity .",
    "thus codimension 1 corresponds to a singular point in a survey with 1 observable , a singular line in a survey with 2 observables , etc .",
    "the corank of the catastrophe is the minimum value of @xmath10 , the dimensionality of the hidden space , which is required for the singularity to occur .",
    "a third classification is by the degree @xmath35 of the singularity : the mean density in a neighborhood of the observable space of radius @xmath55 around the singularity is @xmath56 .",
    "the fold is the only catastrophe with codimension 1 . since the corank of the fold is also 1",
    ", the simplest example occurs in a phase space with two dimensions , one of which is observable .",
    "for example , the generating function ( y;x)=y^3+xy implies that the phase structure is the parabolic curve @xmath57 , and this manifold has a fold catastrophe at @xmath58 . if the linear density on the curve is uniform , the observable density is ( x)(1 - 14x)^1/2 , x<0 , and zero otherwise .",
    "the square - root divergence in density on one side of the singularity is characteristic of a fold , and implies that the degree @xmath59 .",
    "examples of fold catastrophes occur in the projection of a spherical shell onto a plane , rainbows , sunlight sparkling on the sea , twinkling of starlight , gravitational lensing , etc .",
    "the simplest examples of fold catastrophes in phase mixing are shell structures in elliptical galaxies , which are believed to arise from disrupted companion galaxies .",
    "shells are one - dimensional structures that appear in two - dimensional observable space ( the two coordinates on the sky plane ) and hence if they are singularities they must have codimension 1 and hence must be folds .",
    "hernquist and quinn ( 1988 ) carried out simulations of the evolution of disrupted companions in spherical host galaxy potentials , and several of their conclusions can be interpreted in terms of the results we have derived so far .",
    "they find that shell formation requires the accretion of either a dynamically cold or a spatially compact companion ; these are precisely the conditions required so that the cloud dimension @xmath60 (  [ sec : dim ] ) , which in turn is required so that singularities are present in a two - dimensional observable space .",
    "they distinguish `` spatial folding '' ( projection from three - dimensional configuration space to two - dimensional space ) from `` phase - wrapping '' ( projection from phase space into three - dimensional space ) but this distinction is not fundamental : both are projections from phase space into observable space .",
    "finally , they point out that some shells arise from step functions in surface density rather than square - root singularities ; the former are not singularities and hence are not described by catastrophe theory .",
    "the cusp is the only catastrophe with codimension @xmath61 , and has corank 1 .",
    "the cusp is a singular point in a 2-dimensional observable space , a line in 3-dimensional observable space , etc .",
    "for example , consider a phase space with @xmath62 dimensions , two of which are observable .",
    "the generating function ( y;)=y^4+x_2y^2+x_1y [ eq : gencusp ] implies that the phase structure is given by the surface @xmath63 , which is singular ( in the sense of eq .",
    "[ eq : hessmat ] ) along the lines x_1=(-x_2)^3/2 .",
    "[ eq : tan ] each of these lines is a fold catastrophe , and their junction is a cusp catastrophe .",
    "if the surface density of stars is uniform on the phase structure , the surface density in the observable space @xmath64 is given parametrically by ( x_1,x_2)^1/2 , x_1=-y^3-x_2y .",
    "[ eq : csig ] at a distance @xmath65 from the fold ( @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 ( the characteristic fold behavior ) .",
    "the degree of the cusp singularity is @xmath70 .    to illustrate the appearance of a cusp catastrophe , the first three panels of figure [ fig : one ] show a survey that samples the surface density ( [ eq : csig ] ) with 300 , 1000 , and 3000 data points in the interval @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the fourth panel shows a higher - resolution survey with 3000 points in @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "the general cusp in a 2-dimensional observable space is formed from this special case by smooth distortion ( i.e. diffeomorphism ) of the observable space , and still consists of two fold catastrophes meeting with a common tangent , as in equation ( [ eq : tan ] ) .",
    "examples of cusp catastrophes include the caustic curve seen on the surface of coffee in a cup , and the critical point of the van der waals equation of state in the pressure - temperature plane .",
    "one might speculate that some of the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies are cusp catastrophes rather than bound equilibrium stellar systems , but their isopleths are approximately elliptical ( @xcite ) and do not resemble the density contours that are expected near a cusp .",
    "there are three catastrophes with codimension @xmath73 , the swallowtail , elliptic umbilic , and hyperbolic umbilic .",
    "the swallowtail has corank 1 , and thus first appears in a phase space with @xmath74 dimensions ; the umbilics have corank 2 and thus require @xmath75 .",
    "all of these singularities are points in a 3-dimensional observable space , lines in 4-dimensional observable space , etc .",
    "just as a cusp occurs at the junction of two fold curves , these occur at the junction of cusp curves , which are connected by fold surfaces .",
