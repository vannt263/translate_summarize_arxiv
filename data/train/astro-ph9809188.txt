    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) galaxies are a subset of h  ii galaxies with broad emission lines that are characteristic of wr stars ( conti 1991 ) . outside the local universe , the broad feature usually detected in wr galaxies is the so - called wr bump , a blend of he  ii and other lines from c iii , n  iii / n  v. among about 90 known wr galaxies ( schaerer 1997 , private communication ) , thirteen show the broad c iv @xmath2  line , a strong feature from wc stars .",
    "indeed , from the current knowledge of stellar evolution one would expect to detect wc stellar population in about 1/3 of all wr galaxies with a metallicity of ( 1/5 - 1)z@xmath3 ( schaerer & vacca 1998 , sv98 hereafter ) .",
    "the deficiency of such detection might be caused by the weakness of c iv @xmath2  emission , as compared with the wr bump .",
    "alternatively , uncertainties in our knowledge of the evolution of massive stars ( e.g. their mass - loss rates , meynet 1995 ) could be responsible for such an apparent deficiency .",
    "for example , the recent discovery of wr stars in i zw 18 ( izotov et al . 1997@xmath4 , legrand et al .",

    "there is no evidence for the presence of c iii @xmath17   emission line in the spectra .",
    "we can therefore confidently exclude a major population of late type wc stars in mrk  35 , mrk  1039 , and f08208@xmath02816 .    adopting the ionization subclass scheme for classifying wn subtypes ( smith et al .",
    "1996 ) , the early and late wn subtypes were demarcated by whether i(n v @xmath18 ) is smaller ( mn6 subtype ) or larger than 0.5 @xmath6 i(n iii @xmath19 ) in peak fluxes . with this criterion , we found that the peak fluxes of n v @xmath18  in these three sources are below 0.5 @xmath6 i(n iii @xmath19 ) , fitting well to late type wn stars .",

    "our measurements were done using the `` specfit '' task in the stsdas software by decomposing the wr bump into the six components ( three nebular plus three stellar ) between 4640 and 4711    listed in table 2 . given the low spectral resolution and the moderate s / n of 15 - 20",

    "therefore the number ratios of wr / o , or wc/(wr+o ) , wnl/(wr+o ) still help us understand the starburst phenomena . adopting the mean he ii @xmath1/c iv @xmath2  line luminosity of 1.6@xmath610@xmath29/3.0@xmath610@xmath29 and appropriate values of q@xmath27(t , z ) and @xmath28(t , z ) from the new model calculations of sv98 , we have obtained the number of wolf - rayet and o stars , and the wr/(wr+o ) number ratio thereafter in mrk  35 , mrk  1039 , and f08208@xmath02816 , given in table 4 .    from the comparisons of the relative number of wr stars with the model predictions ( cervio & mas - hesse 1994 ; maeder & meynet 1994 ; meynet 1995 ) , we could see that the observed number ratio in these three sources are well above the predicted wr/(wr@xmath0o ) or wr / o ratios for models with constant star formation regimes at metallicities of ( 1/4 - 1/5)z@xmath3 , which would be less than 0.01 , or 0.03 with high mass loss .",

    "therefore , the event of star formation in mrk  35 , mrk  1039 , and f08208@xmath02816 would be in short burst duration .",

    "the large uncertainties of about 40 - 45% in the measurements , however , make this conclusion vague ( schaerer 1997 , private communication ) .",

    "it is possible that a larger value of i(nebular he ii @xmath1 ) will be found in these sources with data of higher resolution , and the relevant stellar emission will not be significantly larger than the model values . since the he ii @xmath1   line is a dominate component in wrbump ,",

    "it should be pointed out that , at the burst age of 4 - 5 myr for our three wr galaxies , the continuum emission from the gas is negligible ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) . the observed equivalent widths of wr features are thus insensitive to the gaseous radiation .",

    "line intensities are less affected by such dilution effects , though unrealistic comparisons for line intensities could be caused by the mismatch of slit width with the nebular emission regions ( see , e.g. meynet 1995 ; sv98 ) . due to this possible `` light loss '' of nebular emission outside the slit",
    ", the relative intensities of c iv @xmath2 could be increased by such a factor .    to the first order , we might estimate the `` loss '' fraction of the balmer emissions by an approach suggested by mas - hesse ( 1997 , private communication ) . with a   profile along the slit",

    "the same corrections have been made for observed values of he ii @xmath1   line and the wr bump , shown also by thin , open symbols in fig .",
    "the results obtained this way might indicate that the fitness to observed c iv @xmath2 in mrk  1039 seems to move away from model predictions based on the salpeter imf , as compared with those before making correction on `` loss '' effect .",
    "for mrk  35 , however , the match is always held , before and after this correction , to the canonical models .",
    "f08208@xmath02816 may be a source showing a clear trend of disparity with canonical models for c iv @xmath2 .",
    "the difference between the observed and the model predictions for this source , however , may not be as large as indicated in the figures . because of the different approaches taken , as discussed in sv98 , the duration of wc phase between the predictions of sv98 and meynet ( 1995 ) are different , although by use of the same stellar models .",
    "wc phase in meynet ( 1995 ) is longer than that in sv98 .",
    "more realistic predictions on wc phase may be longer than that values we used for comparisons .",
    "these comparisons with our low - resolution data tentatively suggest a deviation from the salpeter imf ( 1955 ) in some wr galaxies , which are worth studying at higher resolution .",
    "we are planning to do so , especially considering the fact that both he ii @xmath1   and c iv @xmath2 are detected in these wr galaxies .",
    "the number ratio of wc / wn derived from these two features can provide critical tests on the mass - loss rates , a key input for stellar evolution models of massive stars ( maeder & meynet 1994 , meynet 1995 ) , which has also important consequences for population synthesis models . indeed",
    ", different mass - loss rates can produce different distributions of wr stars among wc and wn subtypes .",
    "for example , the number ratio of wc / wnl @xmath9 1 has been predicted by models of instantaneous starburst with standard mass loss rates at burst age of 4 myr for a metallicity of z=0.004 , while wc / wnl @xmath15 1 by models with high mass - loss rates ( meynet 1995 ) .",

    "the number of wnl stars should be derived from the luminosity of observed he ii @xmath1   after subtraction of the contribution from wc stars to he ii @xmath1  ( de mello et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the compilation of wr line luminosities in sv98 ,",
    "this contribution is included in 4650 blend . for wc4 stars , the he ii @xmath1   from wc stars contributes 8 - 30% of the 4650 blend , based on the estimation of smith et al .",
