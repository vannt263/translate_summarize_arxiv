    "the nature of the @xmath1 meson , discovered by belle in @xmath8 meson decay @xcite and then confirmed by cdf @xcite , d0 @xcite and babar @xcite , is still unknown .",
    "there are two possible interpretations for this resonance : a weakly bound meson - meson molecule @xcite or a charmonium state @xcite , both with @xmath9 quantum numbers .",
    "indeed , recently the new results from the lhcb collaboration @xcite have ruled out the @xmath10 hypothesis @xcite and therefore only the @xmath9 one remains . for a summary of theoretical interpretations of the @xmath1 ,",
    "thus , one has to make an assumption regarding its quark structure , compatible with @xmath9 quantum numbers , to study the properties of the @xmath1 , such as the decay modes .",
    "the first possibility is to consider the @xmath1 as a @xmath11 charmonium state @xcite , with @xmath12 . indeed , qm s predictions show that the @xmath11 is the only state with @xmath9 quantum numbers and lying approximately in the same energy region as the @xmath1 .",
    "the relativized qm @xcite predicts this state to have a mass of 3.95 gev .",
    "nevertheless , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the uncommon properties of the @xmath1 are due to its proximity to the @xmath13 decay threshold and can not be easily explained within a standard quark - antiquark picture for mesons .",
    "specifically , we have demonstated that @xmath1 s mass is lower than quark model s predictions because of self energy shifts ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . thus",
    ", in our picture the @xmath1 is compatible with the meson @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , and is thus interpreted as a @xmath3 core plus higher fock components due to the coupling to the meson - meson continuum @xcite .    the second possibility is to interpret the @xmath1 as a @xmath13 meson - meson molecule with @xmath9 quantum numbers @xcite . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath13 system with @xmath9 quantum numbers can be found by pion exchange and forms a meson - meson molecule .",
    "more recent molecular model calculations @xcite , including quark exchange kernels for the transitions @xmath14 , @xmath15 in order to predict the @xmath15 decay mode of the @xmath1 @xcite , predict large isospin mixing due to the mass difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 . nevertheless , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors observe that the one - pion exchange binding mechanism should be taken with greater caution in the @xmath13 case than in the @xmath18 one ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    other studies proposed a diquark - antidiquark interpretation for the @xmath1 @xcite or different quantum number assignments within a charmonium picture @xcite .",
    "another important test for the properties of the @xmath1 consists of estimating its strong and radiative decay rates @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors re - examine the re - scattering mechanism for the x(3872 ) , which decays to @xmath19 through the exchange of @xmath20 mesons between intermediate states @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "their results for the ratio @xmath23 , between the decay modes @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and for the rate @xmath26 , favor a charmonium @xmath3 interpretation for the @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author uses semi - quantitative methods to study some properties of the @xmath1 ; he points out that the binding mechanism and the production rates are incompatible with the molecule interpretation .",
    "however these results have been criticized in several works @xcite . in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors point out that the production rates in the molecular interpretation are compatible with tevatron data once the charm - meson re - scattering effects are taken into account . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors observe also prompt production from the cdf collaboration and discuss whether a meson - meson molecule , with a dimension of a few fm and intrinsic fragility , can be promptly produced .",
    "by contrast , refs .",
    "@xcite suggest a molecular interpretation for the @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 system was observed for the first time by atlas in 2012 @xcite and later confirmed by d0 @xcite .",
    "the two collaborations gave an estimation for the mass barycenter of the multiplet , @xmath27 gev @xcite and @xmath28 gev @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they did not provide results for the mass splittings between the members of the @xmath0 system .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors state `` further analysis is underway to determine whether this structure is due to the @xmath0 system or some exotic bottom - quark state '' .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 resonances are close to @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 decay thresholds , thus their wave functions may include significative continuum components . we think that the present experimental data @xcite can not exclude this possibility .",
    "something similar also happens in the case of the @xmath1 , since its properties are influenced by the @xmath13 channel @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the interpretation of the @xmath1 as a @xmath3 state with @xmath5 . to do that , we give results for the strong and radiative decays of the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "our results are compared to those of the meson - meson molecular picture .",
    "we also provide unquenched quark model ( uqm ) and relativized quark model ( qm ) results @xcite for the mass barycenter of @xmath0 states , and , especially , for the splittings between them , that can be used to discuss this particular problem . indeed , the magnitude of the splittings between @xmath0 multiplet s states is still unknown . as discussed in the following ,",
    "our uqm @xcite and relativized qm @xcite results for the mass barycenter of the @xmath0 system are in accordance with the present experimental data @xcite , the difference between our theoretical and the experimental results being within the error of a quark model calculation , of the order of @xmath32 mev .",
    "thus , only more precise experimental data for the masses of @xmath0 mesons will make it possible to distinguish between the two different interpretations of these resonances .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors calculate the mass barycenter and mass splittings between the members of the @xmath0 multiplet within different potential models .    as in the case of the @xmath1",
    ", we also give results for the open bottom strong decays and radiative transitions of the @xmath0 states .",
    "these results , along with those for the masses of the @xmath0 resonances , can be a useful tool to investigate the properties of these mesons , that lay quite close to the first open bottom decay thresholds .",
    "in this section , we show our results for the spectrum of @xmath3 mesons with self energy corrections of ref . @xcite . in our calculation",
    "we fitted @xmath33 to the experimental data @xcite . here , the physical mass of a meson , @xmath34 , results from the sum of a bare energy term , @xmath35 , computed within godfrey and isgur s relativized qm of ref .",
