    "the ` zero section ' of @xmath269 is @xmath270 , which may then be identified with @xmath247 , or the upper half plane .",
    "@xmath271 is the union of the sections of @xmath269 corresponding to @xmath272 , and @xmath265 , which thus has 3 components , each a copy of @xmath247 , and containing surfaces whose homology bases have image @xmath273 , and @xmath274 ( not necessarily respectively ) under @xmath192 .",
    "@xmath275 is @xmath269 minus the above 4 sections , with points of the form @xmath276 and @xmath277 identified .",
    "it is therefore connected .",
    "figure [ fig : dbl ] shows the singularities and horizontal foliations of two quadratic differentials , on @xmath278 and @xmath279 , where the second is the result of dehn twisting the first along @xmath251 .",
    "the quadratic differentials on the two surfaces are given by the weierstrass @xmath280 function , which is defined on the curve with modulus @xmath246 as follows : @xmath281 where @xmath282 .",
    "this is a function on the plane but is periodic with respect to @xmath244 , and thus descends to a function on @xmath283 .",
    "we may then define a quadratic differential on @xmath283 , @xmath284 . for most @xmath246 @xmath285",
    "has two single zeroes and a double pole at @xmath201 ; however , for @xmath286 it has a single double zero at @xmath287 , and for @xmath279 it again has a double zero at at the same location .",
    "we can see that for @xmath278 , @xmath288 , and for @xmath279 , @xmath289 and @xmath290 , as predicted by lemma [ lem : twist ] .",
    "we wish to apply a similar analysis to the above to a wider variety of examples . for any @xmath45 , lemma [",

    "we may then create @xmath291 by dehn twisting around @xmath63 ( essentially , picking a new homology basis for @xmath3 ) , and lemma [ lem : twist ] and corollary [ cor : comp ] imply that @xmath15 and @xmath292 must be in different connected components of @xmath20 . in the next theorem",
    "we show that we can use dehn twists to create @xmath15 with homology basis that has any image under @xmath192 except @xmath293 .",

    "note that @xmath299 is homologous to @xmath300 ( with an appropriate choice of orientation of the curves ) so @xmath301 ( mod 2 ) . to prove the theorem we show that one can repeatedly apply dehn twists to get a homology basis of any of the @xmath30 possible parities , except @xmath302 , and then apply corollary [ cor : comp ] . to construct such a set of bases it suffices to show that , given one odd cycle , we can change the parity of any of the other @xmath303 cycles in the basis while fixing the parity of the remaining @xmath304 .",

    "if @xmath308 is even then @xmath310 is even , so @xmath311 is odd , so we can twist around @xmath312 to change the parity of @xmath307 only .    once we can change the parity of only @xmath307 we can also only change the parity of only @xmath311 .",

    "if @xmath307 is even , change its parity , twist around @xmath313 to change the parity of @xmath311 , and change the parity of @xmath307 back to even .",

    ". similarly we can then change the parity of only @xmath321 at will by twisting around @xmath323 .",
    "for @xmath324 we make the same argument to show that we can change @xmath316 , @xmath320 individually .",
    "thus given any @xmath325 odd we can individually change the parity of all @xmath326 except @xmath325 itself .",
    "however if a specific @xmath325 is odd we can make any @xmath327 odd , and make the same argument .",
    "this gives us any configuration of parities where at least one @xmath327 is odd , @xmath328 . on the other hand",
    "if at least one @xmath306 is odd , similar arguments to the above allow us to achieve any configuration of parities except those where all @xmath329 are even , @xmath328 .",
    "the combination of these two cases proves the theorem .",
    "recall that by the results of section [ sec : up ] we expected each of the components of corollary [ cor:22g-1 ] to consist of quadratic differentials whose square roots are a section of a particular line bundle that squares to @xmath31 .",
    "we may associate to each such bundle a @xmath58 valued linear functional on @xmath60 , in an analog of the spin structure construction of section [ sec : back ] , and this will coincide with the degree of the gauss map .",
