    "there has been huge interest over recent years in higher - dimensional models involving degrees of freedom which propagate on lower dimensional surfaces ( or branes ) in a higher - dimensional spacetime ( or bulk ) . in particular for codimension - one branes in an anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , bulk fields have a zero - mode localised near the brane , and hence can yield a lower - dimensional effective theory at low energies without a compact extra dimension  @xcite . in traditional kaluza - klein compactification",
    "the low energy effective theory arises from the lowest eigenmodes of the discrete spectrum of bulk fields .",
    "by contrast the lower - dimensional field living on the boundary of a bulk spacetime can in principle couple to an infinite tower of bulk states even at linear order in perturbation theory  @xcite .    in practice",
    "the more massive bulk modes may be weakly coupled to the boundary at low energies and hence the tower may be neglected .",
    "but if we want to determine the quantum vacuum state of the boundary field at all energies we need to be able to deal with coupling to bulk modes .",
    "this is a practical problem in cosmological models of inflation driven by an inflaton field on a brane @xcite .",
    "the large - scale structure of our universe is supposed to originate from small - scale vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton field during inflation . but",
    "these inflaton fluctuations on the brane start on arbitrarily small scales where they are strongly coupled to the infinite tower of bulk graviton modes @xcite .",
    "therefore , a truncated tower may not give a useful description of the vacuum state on small - scales from which the large - scale structure of our universe is supposed to be derived .    to derive the vacuum state of a coupled boundary - bulk system",
    "we must include the full spectrum of normalisable modes of the system .",

    "they went on to suggest that instabilities might be generic in any orbifold model for the bulk .",
    "but the generality of their argument is open to doubt without including the self - consistent evolution of a reasonable matter source on the brane , and without checking that the instability is not driven by energy flux from the past cauchy horizon .    as a first attempt to study the dynamics of a boundary field coupled to bulk fields in ads we study a simple model of massive bulk and boundary fields with a linear interaction term on the brane defined in section  [ sect : model ] .",

    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of a boundary field coupled to a bulk field with a linear coupling in an anti - de sitter bulk spacetime bounded by a minkowski ( randall - sundrum ) brane . </S>",
    "<S> an instability criterion for the coupled boundary and bulk system is found . </S>",
    "<S> there exists a tachyonic bound state when the coupling is above a critical value , determined by the masses of the brane and bulk fields and ads curvature scale . </S>",
    "<S> this bound state is normalizable and localised near the brane , and leads to a tachonic instability of the system on large scales . below the critical coupling </S>",
    "<S> , there is no tachyonic state and no bound state . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we find quasi - normal modes which describe stable oscillations , but with a finite decay time . only if the coupling is tuned to the critical value does there exist a massless stable bound state , as in the case of zero coupling for massless fields . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relation to gravitational perturbations in the randall - sundrum brane - world . </S>"
