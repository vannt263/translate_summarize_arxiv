    "neutrino fluxes of natural origin are known to carry information both about their sources inaccessible to direct observation and about the properties of the neutrino themselves .",
    "we consider a program of research on natural low - energy ( @xmath1 100 mev ) antineutrino fluxes using a large scintillation spectrometer to be installed at baksan neutrino observatory ( bno ) of the institute for nuclear research , russian academy of sciences , at a depth of @xmath25000 m.w.e .",
    "the planned spectrometer target mass is about 5 kt .",
    "the main research directions and goals are the following :    \\(1 ) neutrino geophysics . determining the radiogenic component of the earth s heat flow through the detection of antineutrinos emitted by daughter uranium and thorium decay products ; detrmining the total abundance of these elements in the earth .    testing the hypothesis that a chain fission reaction is burning at the earth s centre ( `` georeactor '' ) .",
    "\\(2 ) neutrino astrophysics . studying the supernova ( sn",
    ") expolsion dynamics by recording the neutrino burst intensity and energy spectrum . searching for an isotropic flux of antineutrinos accumulated in the universe over several billion years during sn explosions and the formation of neutron stars and black holes .",
    "the first section of the research program has been schematically considered in recent publications [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "this paper is devoted to the possibilities of studying the neutrino burst when cores of high - mass stars gravitationally collapse to produce sne .",
    "the burst of `` thermal '' neutrinos begins simultaneously with gravitational collapse of the iron core of a high - mass ( @xmath3 ) star and lasts for about 20 s. all six types of active neutrinos are produced in a hot core : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these neutrinos carry away the vast bulk of the gravitational energy , @xmath6 erg , released during the collapse .",
    "only several tens of minutes or several hours later does the exposion reach the surface , and a supernova seen with the naked eye and by the methods of optical , x - ray , radio and gamma - ray astronomy flares up in the sky . on competition of the explosion ,",
    "the bulk of the stellar matter is dispersed in space and a neutron star ( or a black hole ) is left at the place of the core .    by neutrino burst onset , the inner part of the core becomes opaque to neutrinos because of its high density . before their escape ,",
    "the neutrinos are multiply scattered , absorbed and reemitted .",
    "the surface from which the neutrinos can leave the core is called a neutrinosphere .",
    "because of the difference in interaction cross sections , the neutrinosphere radii differ for defferent types neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath5 neutrinospheres ( radius @xmath230 km ) are deepest , the @xmath8 neutrinosphere ( @xmath250 km ) follows next , and the latter is followed by the @xmath9 neutrinosphere ( @xmath270 km ) .",
    "this explains the predicted difference in mean energies of the neutrinos escaping from the core .",
    "the larger the radius , the lower the mean energy .",
    "however , as calculations show , all types of neutrinos divide the collapse energy carried away by them approximately evenly .    a short pulse ( @xmath10 s ) of electron neutrinos , @xmath9 , produced via neutronization of the core that reached the stability ( chandrasekhar ) limit is emitted immediately before the  thermal \" pulse .",
    "these @xmath9 s with energies 15 - 20 mev , carry away 5 - 10% of the energy released during the collapse .    studying the neutrino bursts in labratories",
    "is a powerful tool for investigating the energetics and dynamics of collapsing stars and the properties of neutrinos themselves .",
    "the existence of a neutrino burst that accompanies collapse was first pointed out in 1965 [ 5 ] .",
    "intensive calculations of the sn explosion dynamics and neutrino emission were performed in succeeding years [ 6 - 9 ] .",
    "there are a number of detailed reviews ( see [ 10 , 11 ] and references therein ) .",
    "a neutrino burst detection method was also suggested in 1965 [ 12 ] : a statistically significant series of signals must be observed in a massive low - background neutrino detector . however a sn explosion is a very rare event ( one sn explosion in @xmath230 years is expected in our galaxy ) .",
    "therefore , the authors of [ 12 ] suggested synchronizing the operation of various detectors to increase reliability and information content . in our days there",
    "exists the international supernova early warning system ( snews ) that combines all of the detectors capable of detecting sn neutrinos is currently operating .",
    "the neutrinos produced during collapse play an important role in nucleosynthesis [ 15 - 17 ] .",
    "the observed abundances of several light elements ( @xmath11be , @xmath12b , @xmath13f , and others ) , and the abundances of so - called bypassed elementes heavier than iron , can be explained in terms of neutrino reactions within @xmath21000 km of the stellar core centre .",
    "the signal from sn 1987a in the large magellanic cloud was recordered on february 23 , 1987 , with three neutrino detectors - kii in japan , imb in the usa and the baksan detector .",
    "this signal was analyzed in details in a number of papers ( see , e.g. [ 18 , 19 ] ) .",
    "a total of 24 neutrinos were recordered in the above detectors ( the explosion occured at a distance of 50 kpc , which a factor 5 larger than the mean distance from the earth to the stars of our galaxy ) . on the whole ,",
    "the picture obtained is consistent with the outlined neutrino burst scenario , although poor statistics severely limits the information content of the analysis .",
    "note that sn neutrino burst detection is an oscillation experiment with a baseline of @xmath230 thousand light years and that the neutrinos produced in the star traverse regions that are a factor of @xmath14 denser than the matter the solar center .",
    "the flavour composition of neutrinos incident on the detector depends on the mixing parameter @xmath15 and on the type of mass hierarchy ( normal or inversed ) [ 20 , 21 ] .",
    "the conversions @xmath16 open the possibility of studying the intensities and energies of @xmath17 and @xmath5 , whose signal is virtually impossible to isolate directly by currently available methods .",
    "below , we ( 1 ) schematically describe the neutrino detector , ( 2 ) give the characteristics of a  standard \" thermal neutrino burst , ( 3 ) calculate the spectra and rates of expected neutrino events in the detector , ( 4 ) consider the effects of oscillations on the number and spectrum of neutrino events and , ( 5 ) , in conclusion , discuss our results .",
    "the planned detector will consist of three concentric zones .",
    "the central spherical zone abouit 23 m in diameter is filled with a liquid organic scintillator and serves as a target for neutrinos .",
    "the target is separated from the second zone filled with a nonscintillating oil by a strong transparent film .",
    "photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) are installed on the surface of the second zone and view the target through @xmath24-meter layer of liquid .",
    "the outer zone of the detector is an anticoincidence zone .",
    "it is separated from second zone by an opaque metall structure filled with water ( or oil ) and is viewed by pmts that record cerenkov radiation from cosmic muons and showers .",
    "the outer size of the detector is @xmath233 m.    the pmt photocathodes viewing the target cover about 25% of the surface .",
    "the expected signal is 80 - 100 photoelectrons per 1 mev .",
    "the main difference between the detector under consideration and the already existing lvd [ 21 ] and sno [ 22 ] detectors , which are capable of detecting a neutrino burst , is a larger target mass , a good energy resolution , a low detection threshold , and the ability to detect  terrestrial \" antineutrinos .",
    "the detector under construction is closest in structure to the kamland array [ 23 ] , differing from it by a larger target mass and a deeper position underground . the recently suggested lena project [ 24 ]",
    "has a program similar to ours , but it supposes constructing a detector with much larger target mass .    the main ( in time ) mode of operation of the spectrometer is a set of statistics of events generated by terrestrial antineutrinos produced via @xmath18u and @xmath19th decays and by the hypothetical georeactor [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the number of useful events of this type is @xmath2500 per year . in the mode of neutrino burst detection",
    ", the expected number of events can reach several thousand over a period of @xmath220 s.     spectra of the neutrinos incident on the detector ( without oscillations ) , @xmath20 = @xmath21 . ]",
    "we calculate the expected effects in the detector based on the quantitative characteristics of the neutrino burst given below .",
    "\\(1 ) thermal neutrinos carry away an energy of @xmath22 erg , which is divided evenly between the six flavours : @xmath23 and @xmath5 .",
    "\\(2 ) the neutrino energy distribution is described by fermi - dirac distribution with an additional factor that provides a faster falloff of the spectrum at high neutrino energies :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the normalization constant , @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 are the energy and temperature ( in mev ) and @xmath29 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the numerical values of the quantities that characterize spectrum ( 1 ) were taken from [ 7 ] ( see table i ) .",
    "the last two lines in table i give the mean neutrino energies of neutrino calculated from distribution ( 1 ) and the burst - time - integrated flux densities of various types of neutrinos on the detector .",
    "the distance from the collapsing star to the detector was assumed to be 10 kpc ( remind that 1 pc @xmath30 cm ) .",
    "the spectra of the neutrinos incident on the detector are shown in figure 1 .",
    "note a peculiarity of our model that is important for subsequent analysis : the @xmath31 neutrinos @xmath32 have an appreciably harder spectrum than @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    ".characteristics of the thermal neutrino burst ( the sn distance is 10 kpc , without oscillations ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + the mean value for @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "the parameter @xmath33 plays an important role in the physics of weak interactions .",
    "cp - invariance violations in the neutrino sector are possible only if @xmath34",
    ". ways of improving the experiment limitations on the parameter and achieving a better sensitivity were suggested immediately after constraint ( 4b ) was obtained on the chooz reactor [ 30 ] . at present , preparations are being made for new experiments in the field of the reactors of many countries ( see [ 31 ] for a brief review ) .",
    "these experiments should be able improve result ( 4b ) by a factor of 5 - 7 .",
    "the dependence of the spectrum and number of neutrino events on @xmath15 ( table ii , figure 4 ) gives hope that this parameter will be determined with a good sensitivity in future astrophysical observations .",
    "detection of a neutrino burst can give more information than mentioned above .",
    "the processes that take place in the core of a star within the first seconds after its collapse are very complex .",
    "it is not surprising that specialists in this field have failed to reach a consensus of opinion on the spectral composition of the emitted neutrinos even after several decades of intensive calculations .",
    "above we used a model ( [ 7 ] , figure 1 ) , in which @xmath35 have appreciably higher mean energies than @xmath9 and @xmath8 . at the ssame time",
    ", there are studies suggesting that the @xmath31 and @xmath8 energies are close [ 32 ] or almost equal [ 33 ] , while [ 34 ] gives data similar to those in [ 7 ] ( see table iii ) .",
    "what is the dynamics of the core interior temperature within the first seconds after the core collapse ?",
    "how does the neutrino burst flare up and fade out ? how the neutrino gas cools down in the burst time ? and , finally , does a rapidly rotating star actually collapses in two stages separated in time , as explained in detail in [ 35 ] ?",
    "only analysis of a future neutrino burst can give answers to these questions .",
