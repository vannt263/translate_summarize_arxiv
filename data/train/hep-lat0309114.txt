    "results from simulations with an imaginary chemical potential can be analytically continued to a real chemical potential , thus circumventing the sign problem @xcite , @xcite @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the analytical continuation is carried out along one line in the complex @xmath1 plane : first along the imaginary axes , and then along the real one .",
    "it is then meaningful to map this path in the complex @xmath2 plane : because of the symmetry property @xmath3 this can be achieved without losing generality . in the complex @xmath2 plane",
    "the partition function is real for real values of the external parameter @xmath2 , complex otherwise : the situation resembles that of ordinary statistical models in an external field .",
    "hence , the analyticity of the physical observables @xcite as well as that of the critical line @xcite follows naturally .    the phase diagram in the temperature , ( real ) @xmath2 plane is sketched in fig.1 , where we omit the superconducting and the color flavor locked phase , which ( unfortunately ) play no rle in our discussion .",
    "the region accessible to numerical simulations is the one with @xmath4 : at a variance with other approaches to finite density qcd which only use information at @xmath5 @xcite @xcite @xcite the imaginary chemical potential method exploits the entire halfspace . and",
    "we will also argue that there are physical questions which can be addressed without analytic continuation .",
    "also in this case the consideration of the @xmath6 plane helps the analysis .",
    "model analysis suggests the following parametrization , confirmed by numerical results : @xmath7 it encodes reality for real @xmath2 , contains the physical scale @xmath8 , is dimensionally consistent , gives @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "we refer to section iv of ref .",
    "@xcite for our results on the critical line in the four flavor model , and their discussion in terms of model calculations . here",
    "it suffices to remind ourselves that the second order approximation turns out to be adequate , and that the fourth order corrections were found to be consistent with zero within errors .",
    "in this region observables are a continuous and periodic function of @xmath12 , analytic continuation in the @xmath13 half plane is always possible , but interesting only when @xmath14 .",
    "the analytic continuation of an observable @xmath15 is valid till @xmath16 , where @xmath17 has to be measured independently .",
    "the value of the analytic continuation at @xmath18 , @xmath19 defines the discontinuity at the critical point , or , equivalently , the critical value of , say , the number density . in turns ,",
    "this allows the identification of the order of the phase transition .    for observables which are even / odd in the chemical potential , @xmath20 , we have considered a fourier series , observing that the first cosine / sine terms suffice to parametrize the data @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed in @xcite , where this result has been intepreted within the framework of the hadron resonance gas model .",
    "the analytic continuation is valid till @xmath22 but the interval accessible to the simulations at imaginary @xmath1 is small , as simulations in this area hits the chiral critical line for @xmath23 .",
    "the bright side of this is that the nature of the critical line can then be studied without need for analytic continuation . in fig .",
    "3 we show the clear correlation between the polyakov loop and the chiral condensate at @xmath24 .",
    "the correlation between chiral and deconfining transition persists at nonzero chemical potential .",
    "it is also of interest to note that the non  applicability of perturbation theory in this region is almost a theorem : indeed the analytic continuation of the polynomial predicted by perturbation theory for positive @xmath2 would never reproduce the correct critical behavior at the second order phase transition for @xmath23 , and it is then ruled out .",
    "several analytic models have been proposed to describe the properties of this phase and , as analytic models can be obviously analytically continued in the @xmath4 half plane , imaginary chemical potential is an excellent testbed for these approaches . here , as an example , we just contrast the data with a free field behavior @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and we have ignored the fourth order terms . in fig .",
    "4 we plot @xmath28 versus @xmath29 , where we have corrected for finite lattice effects @xmath30 following @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this `` effective prefactor plot '' is perhaps more informative than the direct quadratic fits of @xmath31 to @xmath32 , as it allows an assessment by eye of the @xmath1 dependence , if any , of the prefactor to the quadratic term .",
    "we see that the results approach the perturbative limit , but corrections at small chemical potential are clearly visible , possibly consistent with the predictions of @xcite .",
    "we have studied four flavor qcd within the imaginary chemical potential approach in a large part of the phase diagram .",
    "we have shown that the chiral and deconfining transition remain correlated at nonzero chemical potential .",
    "we have found that the critical line is described by a polynomial , and interpreted this result in terms of simple models .",
    "we have identified and discussed three different regimes : the hadronic phase results are consistent with the hadron resonance gas model .",
    "the roberge weiss regime is eminently nonperturbative , and in this regime we have the possibility to study the nature of the chiral transition at nonzero chemical potential without performing any analytic continuation .",
    "the quark gluon plasma phase is an ideal test bed for analytic models .",
    "the method seems mature for quantitative studies in realistic cases , and a nice possibility is offered by a combination of this approach with other methods , for instance by using reweighting @xcite @xcite or direct calculations of derivatives @xcite at nonzero @xmath1 to improve the accuracy of the results at negative @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the study of discontinuities as sketched in sect.3 above might offer an alternative approach to the study of the endpoints and tricritical points .",
