    "quantum nonlinear systems with chaotic classical counterparts have received much attention in the last two decades .",
    "this field of investigation is sometimes called  quantum chaos  @xcite .",
    "the usual procedure of studying a quantum chaos is to take a system which exhibits chaotic motion , when treated classically , and see what effects occur in a quantum treatment .",
    "all real quantum systems are open and their classical limit is related to the loss of coherence produced by interaction with the environment .",
    "thus , investigations of quantum chaotic system are connected with the correspondence problem in general , and with decoherence and dissipation in particular .",
    "it is now well established that the quantum dynamics of classically chaotic systems will show major departures from the classical motion on a suitable time scale . among these phenomena",
    "we note the dynamical localization of classical diffusive excitation , due to quantum mechanical interference , which is in close analogy with the anderson localization in a random potential .",
    "dynamical localization has been well studied theoretically @xcite and verified in experiments @xcite with laser - cooled atom moving in a standing wave with periodically modulated nodal position .",
    "much research on the subject of classical and quantum chaos is devoted to the kicked rotator , which exhibits regions of regular and chaotic motion in the poincar section ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this model is very popular in investigations of transition to quantum chaos .",
    "its experimental realization , and observation of the model s dissipation and decoherence effects ,  is carried out on gas of ultracold atoms in a magneto - optical trap subjected to a pulsed standing wave @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was proposed to realize the parametrically kicked nonlinear oscillator model in a cavity involving kerr nonlinearity .",
    "it was also shown that more promising realization of this system also including quantum regime , is achieved in the dynamics of cooled and trapped ion , interacting with periodic sequence of both standing wave pulses and gaussian laser pulses @xcite .",
    "another suggestion to investigate quantum chaos in a single trapped ion was recently provided in @xcite .",
    "in fact , while numerous theoretical works on the subject of quantum chaos were carried out , their experimental realization remains somewhat scarce .",
    "moreover , there are still many questions to be answered , yet , and there is obvious need for new systems showing chaos , and new experiments .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new kind of physical systems showing dissipative chaotic dynamics .",
    "these systems are modeled by a dissipative nonlinear oscillator driven by two periodic forces of different frequencies .",
    "this model was proposed to study quantum stochastic resonance in the authors previous paper @xcite , where it was shown , in particular , that the model is available for experiments .",
    "it can be implemented at least for dynamics of strongly interacting photons in optical cavity with @xmath0 nonlinear medium @xcite , and for cyclotron oscillations of a single electron in a penning trap @xcite .",
    "we would especially prefer to study the transition to quantum chaos and its control , the role of dissipation and quantum entanglement in chaotic dynamics , and adjacent questions of characterizing quantum chaos .",
    "these investigations are complemented by consideration of the information aspect of chaotic dynamics through the von neumann entropy .    in classical mechanics",
    "standard characterization of chaos might be given in terms of the unpredictability of phase - space trajectories .",
    "however , the most important characteristics of classical chaotic systems - exponential divergence of trajectories , starting at arbitrarily close initial points in phase - space - does not have quantum counterpart . the question of what the quantum mechanical equivalent of chaos constitutes , has been posed .",
    "many criteria have been suggested to define chaos in quantum systems varying in their emphasis and domain of application @xcite .",
    "as yet , there is no universally accepted definition of quantum chaos .",
    "our analysis of quantum chaos is based mainly on the time - evolution of von neumann entropy and wigner function .",
    "the system under research is dissipative and therefore it has a mesoscopic nature .",
    "quite generally , chaos in classical conservative and dissipative systems has completely different properties , e.g. strange attractors can appear only in dissipative systems .",
    "therefore , the system of our interest might allow us to examine challenging problems of quantum dissipative chaos , including the problem of quantum counterpart of a strange attractor .",
    "we note , while the quantum dynamics of isolated or so called hamiltonian systems with chaotic classical counterparts has studied well , a very liitle work has been done in looking at quantum chaos of dissipative nonlineat systems . among earlier studies of open quantum chaotic systems",
    "it should be noted the papers @xcite . a new impetus to increasing the dissipative quantum chaos area has recently given by study of decoherence and quantum - classical correspondence problem of chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "below we use the traditional ensemble description of markovian open systems , based on the master equation .",
    "then , this equation is presented in quantum trajectories in the frames of quantum state diffusion approach ( qsd ) @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown how quantum state diffusion can be used to model dissipative chaotic systems on individual quantum trajectories @xcite .",
    "in contrast with these papers , here we show how it is possible to describe the quantum chaos using a statistical ensemble of trajectories , which is actually realized in nature .",
    "our results indicate , that though properties of quantum chaotic dynamics do not appear on ensemble averaged oscillatory excitation numbers , these properties are clearly obvious on the entropy and wigner function .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the next section we describe the system proposed , and give the analysis of its classical motion on the poincar section in phase - space . in sec.iii",
    "we develop the quantum description of the problem by numerically solving the master equation through the qsd method .",
    "we present the averaged over quantum trajectories results for the mean excitation number of nonlinear oscillator , and for both the wigner function and the von neumann entropy .",
    "we summarize our results in section iv .",
    "in this section we give the theoretical description of the system . the nonlinear oscillator driven by two periodic forces at frequencies @xmath1 and@xmath2 and interacting with a reservoir",
    "is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath3 + h_{loss } ,   \\label{ham}\\ ] ]  where @xmath4 are boson annihilation and creation operators , @xmath5 is an oscillatory frequency and @xmath6 is the strength of the anharmonicity .",
    "the couplings with two driving forces are given by rabi frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 responsible for the linear losses of  oscillatory states , due to couplings with heat reservoir operators giving rise to the damping rate @xmath10 the reduced density operator @xmath11 within the framework of the rotating - wave approximation ,  in the interaction picture corresponding to the transformation @xmath12 is governed by the master equation    @xmath13 + \\sum_{i=1,2}\\left ( l_{i}\\rho l_{i}^{+}-\\frac{1}{2}% l_{i}^{+}l_{i}\\rho -\\frac{1}{2}\\rho l_{i}^{+}l_{i}\\right ) ,   \\label{mastereq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 + \\hbar \\chi ( a^{+}a)^{2}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]  here@xmath15 @xmath16  is the detuning , and @xmath17 @xmath16 is the difference between driving frequencies , which works as modulation frequency .",
    "@xmath18 are the lindblad operators :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the spontaneous decay rate of the dissipation process , and @xmath21 denotes the mean number of quanta of a heat bath .",
    "note , only the case of a vacuum reservoir , @xmath22 , considered below .    for @xmath23",
    "this equation describes the single driven , dissipative anharmonic oscillator , which is a well - known and archetypal model in nonlinear physics @xcite . in the semiclassical approach and in steady - state",
    "this system exhibits bistability , which appears as the hysteresis behavior of the mean oscillatory number , versus either the detuning @xmath24  or the strength of driving @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "however , the hysteresis in the quantum - mechanical treatment disappears on ensemble - averaged mean oscillatory number @xmath25 and bistability , manifests itself on individual quantum trajectories , as noise - induced transitions between two possible metastable states @xcite , as well as on the statistics of oscillatory numbers @xcite .    in the case of double driven oscillator ,",
    "when two external forces are both present , the corresponding hamiltonian ( [ volod ] ) includes explicit time - dependence , even in the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "it may therefore , be expected that the system presented above , exhibits regions of regular and chaotic motion depending from the parameters : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath8 and @xmath10 to illustrate the operational regimes of the oscillator , first we pay attention to the classical description . after making the usual approximations , the classical limit of eq.([mastereq ] )",
    "becomes    @xmath29    where @xmath30  is the dimensionless complex amplitude , corresponding to the operator @xmath31 we analyze the time - dependent solution of this equation in the phase - space of dimensionless position and momentum @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "there are a number of ways to make such analysis .",
    "we adopt a discrete surface or poincar section of this system .",
    "let @xmath34 @xmath35 be an arbitrary initial phase - space point of the system at the time @xmath36 then we define a constant phase map in the @xmath37 plane by the sequence of points @xmath38 changing the time intervals by @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "this means , that for any @xmath41 the system is in one of the points of poincar section .",
    "our analysis shows that for extended time scales exceeding the damping rate , the asymptotic dynamics of the system is regular in the limits of small and large values of modulation frequency , i.e. @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and also when one of the perturbation forces is much greater than the other : @xmath44 or @xmath45 the dynamics of the system is chaotic in the range of parameters @xmath46 and  @xmath47 .",
    "fig.1 shows the results of numerical calculations of the classical maps , for the parameters chosen in the range of chaos .",
    "these figures clearly indicate the classical strange attractors with fractal structure , which are typical for a chaotic poincar section ( we choose @xmath48 for all cases ) .",
    "it is expected from these results , that the domain of phase - space which includes an attractor , strongly depends on the parameters @xmath49 @xmath8 and @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , the domain increases with the increase of @xmath7 or @xmath50 and with the decrease of the decay rate @xmath20 .",
    "below we give the general consideration of this effect considering equation ( [ clas ] ) in the following integral form : @xmath51 .",
    "\\label{integ}\\ ] ] here @xmath52 is an initial value at @xmath53 and @xmath54 is introduced as follows : @xmath55    it is easy to estimate the module of the complex amplitude @xmath56  taking into account that @xmath57  is a real function . for its maximum on time interval value @xmath58 we obtain @xmath59    this formula determines the border of a classical map in dependence from rabi frequencies and the decay rate , and explains the above conclusion about the size of the strange attractor in phase - space .",
    "it is interesting , that this border size for the anharmonic oscillator is independent from the parameter of nonlinearity @xmath6 and the detunings @xmath24 and @xmath60 it should be noted a peculiarity of the system proposed regarding the strange attractors . as can be seen from the numerical results , the attractors depicted on fig .",
    "1 ( a ) and fig . 1 ( c ) for different parameters have the same form in phase - space and differ from each other only on the scales .",
    "it is obvious that this property is the consequence of a scaling symmetry of the classical equation ( [ clas ] ) .",
    "indeed , it easy to verify that eq.([clas ] ) remains invariable for the following scaling transformation of the complex amplitude @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a real positive dimensionless coefficient , if the parameters @xmath26 @xmath24 , @xmath63 @xmath64 correspondingly transformed as : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67  we have illustrated such symmetry on figs . 1 ( a),(c ) where the attractors are presented for two sets of parameters coupled by the scaling transformations .",
    "we note , that in the quantum treatment the diffusion term in the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) affects the scaling symmetry roughly .  in sec.iii",
    ", we will discuss this and other properties of strange attractors common with the wigner function , in more detail .",
    "in this section we examine the problem of quantum dissipative chaos on the basis of the von neumann entropy and the wigner function . the peculiarities and advantages of such a consideration for interpreting quantum chaos in an ensemble theory , are as follows :    the von neumann entropy , which is defined through the reduced density operator as @xmath68 is a measure of dissipation and decoherence .",
    "the entropy for an isolated quantum system , does not change under the time evolution .",
    "if the time evolution of the system is perturbed through interaction with an environment , the averaging over the perturbation typically leads to an entropy increase .",
    "the von neumann entropy also is a sensitive operational measure of an entanglement , as well as the measure of the purity of quantum states @xcite .",
    "if the system is in pure state , the entropy is precisely zero .",
    "thus , it is expected that the study of entropy ( [ entropy ] ) for doubly driven oscillator will allow to examine chaos in terms of quantum entanglement .    for an extended time - evolution period",
    "the classically chaotic system at moments @xmath69 , @xmath40 , fills the poincar section in phase - space .",
    "there are a number of methods to treat poincar section quantum mechanically .",
    "we note the ref.@xcite , where a method of quantization of classical dissipative maps was proposed .",
    "the poincar section of one quantum trajectory was considered in @xcite . for our dynamical model",
    "we adopt the method of the wigner function and study the features of correspondence between the wigner function , which is taken at one of the moments @xmath70 and poincar section .",
    "it was obtained through a computer simulation of the wigner function .",
    "we analyze the problem of dissipation on the basis of the qsd method , which operates with stochastic states @xmath71 describing the evolution along a quantum trajectory .",
    "the equation of motion is : @xmath72 here @xmath73 indicates the dependence on the stochastic process , the complex wiener variables @xmath74 satisfy the fundamental correlation properties :    @xmath75    and the expectation value equals @xmath76 .",
    "according to this method the reduced density operator is calculated as the ensemble mean @xmath77 over the stochastic pure states @xmath71 describing the evolution along a quantum trajectory .",
    "let us first qualitatively describe the most important physical processes , which are responsible for the origin of chaotic dynamics in our qsd numerical study .",
    "there are two ways to realize the controlling transition from the regular to chaotic dynamics , by changing one of the parameters of the system .",
    "one of these ways is to vary the strength @xmath8 of the second force in the range from @xmath78 to @xmath79 . in the limit @xmath78 the system",
    "is reduced effectively to the model of single driven anharmonic oscillator , which exhibits bistability for the definite range of parameters @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath63 and @xmath10  in this limit our analysis of the time - dependent stochastic trajectories for expectation numbers @xmath82 @xmath83shows , that the system in the bistability range spends most of the time close to one of the semiclassical solutions of eq.([clas ] ) , with quantum interstate transitions , occurring at random intervals . with increasing the amplitude @xmath8 for the other parameters , chosen to lead bistability in terms of semiclassical solution , the stimulated processes , i.e. dynamical interstate transitions , become sufficient .",
    "their contribution at @xmath84  leads to the emergence of a chaotic regime on quantum trajectories . in the limit",
    "@xmath85 the regular dynamics is restored .",
    "this limit is equivalent to the case of @xmath86 because we can choose such an interaction picture , that time dependent exponent in ( [ volod ] ) will appear near @xmath87 in fact , using the transformation @xmath88 of the reduced density operator , we arrive to the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) with the hamiltonian @xmath89 + \\hbar \\chi ( a^{+}a)^{2}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is obtained from ( [ volod ] ) by the replacements @xmath90",
    "@xmath91  @xmath92 @xmath93 . nevertheless , these marginal cases differ in details , as explained below .    in an other scenario of transition",
    "to chaos the modulation frequency @xmath94 is varied , with other unchanged parameters . in the range of small frequencies @xmath95",
    "the modulation of the system is adiabatic .",
    "so , in the range of bistability the system oscillates between the two possible metastable states . with increasing frequency , at @xmath96 , a strong entanglement of these states occurs , and the system comes to chaos .",
    "it should be noted that , as we will show below , the transition from the regular to chaotic dynamics in the classical system , is marked in the quantum system by an increase of the von neumann entropy , as well as by a strong transformation of the wigner functions . for the case",
    "@xmath97 the dynamics of the system becomes regular again .",
    "we give the results of qsd analysis in the regimes of strong anharmonicity , considering the parameters from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "the former case is strongly quantum mechanical , since the maximum mean number of oscillatory excitations is about 10 , while the case , @xmath100 , corresponds to a quasiclassical regime , when the maximum in time oscillatory number is about 130 .",
    "the truncated basis of fock number states of harmonic oscillator is used for the expansion of state vectors @xmath101 and an initial vacuum state is chosen .",
    "the mean excitation number of double driven anharmonic oscillator versus time interval is of particular interest in this paper . figures 2(a),(b ) depict the ensemble averaged mean oscillatory numbers @xmath102 for both cases of regular and chaotic dynamics , which are realized in the classical limit . the parameters for fig.2(b )",
    "are chosen the same as for fig.1 ( c ) .",
    "the classical oscillatory number @xmath103 derived from equation ( [ clas ] ) for the same parameters as the above chaotic regime , is illustrated in fig.2(c ) . from these figures",
    "it is evident that while the classical result ( fig.2(c ) ) shows usual chaotic behavior , its quantum ensemble counterpart ( fig.2(b ) ) has clear regular behavior . thus , the chaotic behavior in the classical model , transforms into the periodic dynamics in the quantum treatment which involves ensemble averaging .",
    "these results indicate , that quantum dissipative chaotic dynamics is not evident on the mean oscillatory number .",
    "now we will show how quantum chaos emerges on both the wigner function and the von neumann entropy .",
    "we apply the qsd to determine wigner functions for the quantum states of double driven anharmonic oscillator during time evolution . for this",
    "we use the well - known expression for the wigner function in terms of matrix elements @xmath104 of density operator in the fock state representation @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the polar coordinates in the complex phase - space plane @xmath107 , @xmath108 and the coefficients @xmath109 are fourier transform of matrix elements of the wigner characterization function@xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 are laguerre polynomials . in our calculation we assume , that the oscillator is initially prepared in a vacuum state , and regimes of strong anharmonicity @xmath112  are realized .    in fig.3",
    "we demonstrate moving of our system from the regular to chaotic dynamics by plotting the wigner function for three values of @xmath8 : @xmath113 ( a)@xmath114 @xmath115 ( b)@xmath114 @xmath116 ( c ) , in a fixed moment of time .",
    "the values of @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 are chosen to lead to bistability in the model of single driven oscillator @xmath120 .",
    "we can see that for the case of a weak second force fig.3(a ) the wigner function has two humps , corresponding to the lower and upper level of excitation of anharmonic oscillator in the bistability region .",
    "the hump centered close to @xmath121 describes the approximately coherent lower state , while the other hump shows , that the upper state is squeezed . the effect of squeezing",
    "is displayed as the squeezing of gaussian .",
    "this result represents the known property of the wigner function for the single driven anharmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the graphs in fig.3 are given at an arbitrary time , exceeding the damping time .",
    "as calculations show , for the next time intervals during the period of modulation @xmath122 the hump corresponding to the upper level rotates around the central peak .",
    "when we increase the strength of the second force , the classical system reaches to a chaotic dynamics . the wigner function for the chaotic dynamics is depicted in fig.3(b ) . further increasing @xmath50 the system returns to the regular dynamics .",
    "the corresponding wigner function at an arbitrary time exceeding the transient time is presented in fig.3(c ) .",
    "it contains only one hump , rotating around the centre of the phase - space within the period . as mentioned above , the limit @xmath85 is physically equivalent to the opposite case @xmath123 , when the system in each moment of time is close to the model of single driven nonlinear oscillator .",
    "the difference is that the rabi frequency @xmath8  in this case ( fig.3(c ) ) is taken outside the bistability range , where the system is in the upper level .",
    "so , the wigner function has approximately the same form , as the wigner function for single driven anharmonic oscillator , in the monostable above threshold regime of operation , when the system is excited .",
    "as we see , the wigner function reflecting chaotic dynamics ( fig.3(b ) ) , has a complicated structure .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to observe that its contour plots in @xmath37 plane are generally similar to the corresponding classical poincar section .",
    "now we will consider this problem in more detail , comparing the results summarized in fig.1 with the numerical calculations of wigner functions , for the same sets of parameters as for the classical maps .",
    "we present our results in fig.4 .",
    "it can be seen in fig.4.(a ) that for the deep quantum regime ( @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 ) , the contour plot of the wigner function is smooth and concentrated approximately around the attractor ( fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , the different branches of the attractor are hardly resolved in fig.4.(a ) .",
    "it can also be seen , that in this deep quantum regime , an  enlargement of the wigner function occurs in contrast to the poincar section .    taking a smaller @xmath127 ,",
    "the contour plot of the wigner function approaches the classical poincar section .",
    "this can be seen in figs.4(b),(c ) . for the last case",
    "the correspondence is maximal , and some details of the attractor ( fig.1(c ) ) are resolved much better in fig.4(c ) .",
    "this analysis allows us also to note that the scaling symmetry of strange attractors shown on figs . 1  ( a )",
    ", ( c ) dissapears for corresponding contour plots of wigner functions [ figs .",
    "4 ( a ) , ( c ) ] in the quantum treatment of dissipative chaos .",
    "it should be specified that for all contour plots in fig.4 , the corresponding wigner functions have regions of negative values .",
    "these results are related to chaotic regimes .",
    "obviously , this fact reflects a quantum interference in the chaotic state of the system considered .",
    "it follows that the ranges of negative values of the wigner function increase with the increasing parameter @xmath118 when the system moves to a deep quantum regime .",
    "nevertheless , the ranges of negative values of the wigner function are also observed for the comparatively small parameter @xmath128 , where an operation regime close to the semiclassical is realized .",
    "it is illustrated in fig.5 for parameter @xmath99 , where the mean excitation number equals 130 .",
    "since our model is dynamical , we can also consider the correspondence between the wigner function and the poincar section , which are taken at @xmath129 , for arbitrary @xmath130 . despite different forms , which the wigner function and the poincar section have acquired , the correspondence features are the same .",
    "as shown in section iiia , the quantum chaotic dynamics is not displayed clearly on ensemble averaged oscillatory excitation number .",
    "the purpose of this subsection is merely to demonstrate how chaos is seen on the von neumann entropy , which is one of the significant characteristics of a quantum ensemble .",
    "we also clarify other important questions in relation with quantum chaos and entanglement in the system .",
    "these analysis complete the above studies of quantum dissipative chaos in the wigner function .",
    "two ways of producing chaos in a controlled manner will be considered by monitoring the system through varying either the strength of the driving force , or the difference frequency @xmath131 .",
    "we calculate the evolution of the entropy by formula ( [ entropy ] ) , using the results for reduced density matrix expressed through an ensemble of trajectories .",
    "the calculations are performed by diagonalization of the matrix @xmath132 in the truncated fock states basis .",
    "first , ( fig.6 ) we demonstrate the transition of the system from regular dynamics to chaos by plotting the von neumann entropy for three values of strength of the driving field :  @xmath133 ( a)@xmath114 @xmath134 ( b)@xmath114 @xmath116 ( c ) .",
    "the same parameters are chosen as in fig.3 for the wigner function . in fig.6(a ) and fig.6(c ) we plot the entropy evolution for the regions with classically regular behavior , while the fig.6(b ) shows entropy production for the chaotic motion .",
    "the essential difference between the behavior of the entropy for regular and chaotic dynamics is clearly displayed in these figures .",
    "the common feature is , that for times exceeding the time scale of transient dynamics , the entropy production in the chaotic regime dominates over the entropy production of regular dynamics .",
    "these results are in good qualitative agreement with the above results on the wigner function , and reflect the dependence of entropy production on both the quantum entanglement , and formation of states in the system .",
    "naturally , entropy production is stipulated by the entangling interaction between the anharmonic oscillator and its environment on the one hand , and is determined by the structure of mixed states of nonlinear oscillator , on the other hand . as a result , the maximal value of the entropy ( fig.6(b ) )",
    "is realized for chaotic dynamics with a large number of mixed states as depicted in fig.3(b ) , while its minimum takes place for the regular dynamics with one hump wigner function ( fig.3(c ) ) . also , we note , that the oscillations of the entropies evident in fig.5 , have the frequency @xmath60  the simulations also show the definite difference between transient times of regular and chaotic dynamics",
    ". there is some ambiguity in the definition of the transition time because of the oscillatory nature of curves .",
    "nevertheless , it is clearly evident , that the transient time of entropy evolution for the regular case exceeds one for the chaotic dynamics .",
    "in addition to providing criteria to characterize chaos , we have also studied the behavior of the entropy versus controlling parameters @xmath64 and @xmath60 the results of numerical calculations at a definite time moment exceeding the transient time , are presented in fig.7(a ) , where minimum values of entropy for different @xmath8 are presented .",
    "let us compare these results with the emergence of chaos in the classical limit .",
    "it is easy to check , that for the classical case and for parameters shown in fig.6 chaos appears at the critical point of @xmath135 and disappears at @xmath136 it is a well known property of classical chaos , that it appears suddenly . as it is seen in fig.7(a ) , the quantum chaos appears smoothly : the entropy increases , as the value of @xmath8 approaches the critical value @xmath137 another way to probe chaos is the varying of detuning @xmath131 . in fig.7(b )",
    "the behavior of the entropy versus modulation frequency @xmath131 are displayed .",
    "we have presented novel type of a time - dependent systems showing chaotic dynamics and intrinsically quantum properties .",
    "these systems are modelled by a dissipative anharmonic oscillator driven by two forces of different frequencies .",
    "we emphasize that this model is different from the ones like single driven nonlinear oscillator , where a pulsed pump field could be used and might be proposed as a possible experimental test of quantum chaos in area of quantum optics with continuous cw laser .",
    "the proposed model seems experimentally feasible with state - of the - art equipment and can be realized at least in two experimental schemes .",
    "so , the nonlinear behavior of single - mode field in a medium with a third - order nonlinearity may provide simple realization of the dynamics of driven anharmonic oscillator .",
    "in fact , a single - mode field is well described in terms of anharmonic oscillator , and the nonlinear media could be an optical fiber or a @xmath0 crystal , placed in a cavity . in the later case",
    "the anharmonicity of mode dynamics comes from the self - phase modulation due to the photon - photon interaction in @xmath0-medium , and dissipative effects arise from the leakage of photons through the cavity mirrors .",
    "such a system under two driving fields is described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )  with @xmath138 @xmath139 being the operators of a single cavity mode .",
    "cyclotron oscillations of a single - electron in a penning trap with a magnetic field , is another realization of the quantum anharmonic oscillator .",
    "its anharmonicity comes from nonlinear relativistic correction to an electron motion , while dissipative effects arise from the spontaneous emission of synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the trapped electron driven by a single coherent field , has been experimentally realized and studied in refs .",
    "the model we present here corresponds to the one - electron cyclotron oscillator in two coherent fields at different frequencies .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is given by ( [ ham ] ) , where operators @xmath138 @xmath139 describe the cyclotron quantized motion at the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath128 used in our calculations , have been achieved experimentally for both above mentioned physical systems .",
    "the dynamics of double driven anharmonic oscillator exhibits a rich phase - space structure , including the regimes of regular and chaotic motion , with the two rabi frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the difference @xmath131  between driving frequencies being the control parameters .",
    "we suppose that the adequate way of investigating the quantum chaos is not only the investigation of the behavior of an individual realization of trajectories , as suggested by several authors , but also studying the dynamics of statistical ensemble of quantum trajectories , which is naturally realized in experiments . for realization of this program of studies",
    "the quantum state diffusion simulation method , based on the master equation of lindblad form is used .",
    "we also conclude , that the distinction between regular and chaotic dynamics can be most easily understood by studying the dynamics of essentially quantum properties , as the von neumann entropy and the wigner function are only two examples .",
    "in fact , our numerical analysis has shown that the quantum dynamical manifestation of chaotic behavior , does not appear on ensemble averaged oscillatory excitation numbers , but is clearly seen on the entropy and probability distributions .",
    "the connection between quantum and classical treatments of chaos was realized by means of comparison between strange attractors on the classical poincar section , and the contour plots of the wigner functions . we have demonstrated that for small values of the ratio @xmath140 the contour plots of wigner functions are relatively close to the strange attractors . indeed , as we have shown on fig . 1 ( c ) and fig .",
    "4 ( c ) some details of the attractor are resolved on the contour plots .",
    "such likeness of quantum and classical distribution vanishes in the deep quantum regime [ see fig . 1 ( a ) , and fig . 4 ( b ) for @xmath141 . an important point to emphasize is that the scaling symmetry of strange attractors in the model studied here violates in the quantum treatment of chaos .",
    "the drastic difference between the time - dependent behavior of the von neumann entropy for regular and chaotic regimes is clearly displayed in figs .",
    "the von neumann entropy indicates the connection between chaos and entanglement , and has also been used to study characteristic time scales of the emergence of chaos . for short time intervals",
    "@xmath142 the entropies are linearly increasing function of time for both the regular and chaotic regimes . for times exceeding the time scale of transient dynamics",
    "this behavior transforms to the periodic one , however the entropy for the chaotic regime dominates over the entropy for the regular dynamics .",
    "it has also shown that the transient time for the chaotic regime is smaller than in the regular regime .    in our analysis",
    "we have not investigated all possible quantum effects of chaotic dynamics .",
    "in particular , we have specified that the wigner function for chaotic regime has regions of negative values even for relatively high values of @xmath143 ( @xmath144 on fig . 5 , where the mean oscillatory number @xmath145 ) .",
    "this fact reflects the quantum interference effect in the chaotic dissipative dynamics .",
    "however , we have not analyzed the correlation between the emergence of chaos and quantum interference , which is an interesting albeit complicated option for the future .",
