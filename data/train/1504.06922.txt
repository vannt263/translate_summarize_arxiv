    "a mathematical model of networks is useful in physics , computer science , urban planning , etc .",
    "there are many methods for constructing spatial networks by applying a growing rule or optimization .",
    "one of the attractive methods is based on a recursive geometric growing rule for the division of a chosen triangle @xcite or for the attachment which aims at a chosen edge @xcite in a random or hierarchical selection . in particular , the fractal - like networks @xcite generated by iterative subdivision of equilateral triangle or square faces are more efficient with shorter link lengths and more suitable with lower load for avoiding traffic congestion than the state - of - the - art complex networks .",
    "these typical complex networks are geometric growing models @xcite and the spatially preferential attachment models @xcite with various topological structures ranging from river to scale - free geographical networks @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the advantages of the fractal - like networks are due to the bounded path lengths by the @xmath0-spanner property @xcite and the small degrees of nodes without overloaded hubs @xcite .",
    "the subdivision of squares @xcite is generalized to the subdivision of rectangles into four or two smaller faces @xcite .",
    "such a binary subdivision of rectangle faces is related not only to a self - organization of networks @xcite in complex network science but also to an object generation in computer graphics , e.g. the map l - system @xcite for road network generation in urban modeling @xcite and the space partitioning for dungeon generation in a role playing game ( rpg ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , the hierarchical structure defined by inclusion relations of faces is equivalent to a binary tree .",
    "binary tree @xcite is a well - known date structure for sorting numbers in computer science .",
    "it is assumed that the input stream of query is a permutation of the integers @xmath1 , whose orderings are at random in a general problem setting . for the search task ,",
    "an integer of the input is inserted at a leaf as the terminal node that satisfies the ordering condition in any path starting at the root .    in spite of the above potential connections , these researches were independent .",
    "moreover , the theoretical analysises for a random binary tree @xcite are a little difficult and probably unknown except in a community for mathematicians .",
    "thus , in this paper , we aim    * to make the derivation of fundamental properties more easily understandable * to discuss some relations among the findings in the above different research fields    for the iteratively random subdivision .",
    "let us consider the following subdivision model .",
    "step 0 : : :    set an initial face of rectangle .",
    "step 1 : : :    at each discrete time @xmath2 , chose a    rectangle uniformly at random .",
    "step 2 : : :    the chosen rectangle face is divided by a line into smaller two ones    which is called as twin faces . step 3 : : :    until the break of a given condition , return to step 1 at the next    time .    in step 3 , for example , we consider a condition : the total number of faces is smaller than a given size .    to simplify the discussion without loss of the fundamental properties , we ignore the area ratio of the divided rectangle faces ,",
    "therefore we do not care the edge lengths of the divided rectangle face by a bridge line over the chosen face .",
    "conceptually , the stochastic subdivision of faces is equivalent to a random binary tree as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_division ] , although we do not discuss a search problem for random queries .",
    "the leaves in a random binary tree represent the rectangle faces , which are classified into adjacent twin faces generated at a same time and the other faces .     and",
    "@xmath3 from top to bottom .",
    "( left ) random subdivision of face .",
    "( right ) the corresponding binary tree .",
    "the leaf nodes marked by square and open circle represent the twin faces and the other faces , called as feets and arms @xcite , respectively .",
    "a , b , @xmath4 , f denotes an identifier of each face.,height=585 ]",
    "we denote @xmath5 as the number of rectangle faces counted at time @xmath0 for whose birth - time is @xmath6 . in other words ,",
    "the birth - time is the generation time of twin faces by subdivision .",
    "although @xmath5 is an integer @xmath7 in each sample of the stochastic process , we consider the average behavior over many samples .",
    "the rate for choosing a face with the birth - time @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath5 because of the uniformly random selection .",
    "thus , we obtain the expectation @xmath8 and rewrite it to @xmath9 where the total number of faces at time @xmath0 is exactly @xmath10 .",
    "the initial configuration is one face , @xmath11 .    by recursively applying the difference eq .",
    "( [ eq_diff ] ) with the initial condition @xmath12 , we derive @xmath13 for the average number of faces , our new result of eq .",
    "( [ eq_sol ] ) gives the time - course of decaying by @xmath14 with the dependency on the birth - time @xmath6 .",
    "we consider the expectation time @xmath15 when the average number of faces becomes one for the twin faces with a birth - time @xmath6 . since we obtain @xmath16 from @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_sol ] ) , the average lifetime of more than one face after the births is @xmath18 thus , younger faces with a larger @xmath6 have a longer lifetime .",
    "we emphasize that this iterative stochastic subdivision is not a poisson process assumed in the analysis for a random quadtree model @xcite , because the selection probability of a face is decreasing as time passes even with uniform randomness in increasing the total number of faces .",
    "therefore , younger faces have less chances for the selection .",
    "this is not independent and identically distributed .",
    "we consider the case that both twin faces generated at time @xmath6 remain at next time @xmath19 .",
    "the probability for the unselection in the total @xmath19 faces is @xmath20 until time @xmath0 , the remaining probability is given by the product of eq .",
    "( [ eq_unselect ] ) @xmath21 by summing @xmath22 for all twin faces with birth - times @xmath23 , we derive the rate of twin faces @xmath24 where we use the formulas @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the approximation is valid for a large @xmath0 .",
    "since each pair of the twin has two faces , the number of faces is @xmath27 averagely .",
    "thus , the rate of other faces is @xmath28 .",
    "these rates are consistent with the asymptotical result @xcite derived by a complicated analysis , and related to the existing rate @xmath29 of nodes with degrees @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 @xcite in a random binary tree . here",
    ", @xmath33 denotes the number of nodes including leaves with degree @xmath30 , non - terminal nodes with degrees @xmath31 or @xmath32 , and a root with degree @xmath31 . from the rate of these degrees @xcite",
    ", the expected tree has a balanced shape without too deep layers by the dominant long chains of node degree @xmath31 .",
    "the balanced tree corresponds to a bell - shape of the poisson distribution as mentioned in the next section .",
    "next , we consider the distribution of layered faces . faces on the @xmath34-th layer are one - to - one corresponding to the leaves at the depth @xmath34 in the binary tree .",
    "the number of faces on the @xmath34-th layer can increase until @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ fig_layered_faces ] shows an example of the layer .     and @xmath3 .",
    "( left ) layered faces .",
    "( right ) the corresponding binary tree.,height=151 ]    we denote @xmath36 as the number of faces that belong to the @xmath34-th layer generated after the selections of @xmath34 times on the descendant from the initial face . as mentioned in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the random process by subdivision in the following continuous - time approximation @xmath37 @xmath38 the self - similarity in the iterative subdivision of squares @xcite does not affect the analysis of the distribution , because we treat only the number of faces on each layer without dependence on the shapes .    the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_ips1])([eq_ips2 ] ) are @xmath39 and @xmath40 the total number of faces is given by @xmath41 where we use the taylor series expansion @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , from @xmath43 , we obtain the poisson distribution with a parameter @xmath44 @xmath45 note that @xmath46 is a function of variable @xmath34 , and @xmath47 is a auxiliary variable to take a temporal snapshot . the mean and the variance of @xmath46",
    "follow @xmath48 by the variable transformation between a linear time variable @xmath0 and a logarithmic time variable @xmath47 from the relation for the total number of faces @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "of course they show the asymptotic behavior for a large @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in the bell - shaped poisson distribution of layers , the peak position for the most majority of layers shifts to be deeper , and the width becomes wider as the divisions are iterated .",
    "even if the expanding property can be qualitatively predicted , the logarithmic time - course is not trivial .",
    "this simply analyzed property of @xmath50 is also related to the deepest level in a random binary tree @xcite .",
    "however , the poisson approximation of distribution was not derived .",
    "by using analytical approaches of difference and differential equations , we have more easily derived the fundamental properties for the average lifetime of faces and the distribution of layered faces in the iteratively random binary subdivision of rectangles which is usually treated as a discrete mathematical problem .",
    "we remark that eqs .",
    "( [ eq_sol])([eq_rate_twins])([eq_pl ] ) hold in more general case divided by non - vertical and non - horizontal lines with any angles because of no relation to area and shape of faces .",
    "our obtained results will be useful for generating road networks in virtual cities @xcite and dungeons in a rpg @xcite , automatically . in a dungeon generation ,",
    "the layered faces is applicable to a design of corridor placement @xcite .",
    "in particular , rooms assigned to twin faces are connected with a corridor .",
    "( [ eq_rate_twins ] ) suggests that such rooms exist averagely in @xmath51 of the whole rooms for the uniformly random divisions , and a game player can directly wander back and forth between them .",
    "when we consider a preferential selection of face according to the depth of layer @xcite instead of the uniformly random selection , we can control the rate of twin faces . the rate becomes larger as a shallow face is chosen for the division , then balanced similar depths appear .",
    "in contrast , it becomes smaller as a deeper face is chosen , then unbalanced various depths appear .",
    "so , the rate of @xmath51 gives a baseline .",
    "on the other hand , the layered faces represent a historical trace of the construction in a road network . generally , an area of face is smaller as the layer becomes deeper .",
    "thus , long - range access roads tend to be constructed at first , thereafter short - range lanes tend to be added by little and little .",
    "a bridge lane that produces twin faces by subdivision may be related to increasing the efficiency of traffic through bypaths on the road network . in the modeling of road networks",
    ", we can generate both t - shaped and @xmath52-shaped intersections by using a probabilistic selection with a constant mixing rate for quartered and binary divisions of faces , instead of the uniformly random selection .",
    "conversely , the mixing rate of quartered and binary divisions may be estimated from real data of road networks .",
    "these base line , historical trace , and mixing rate can be also discussed in complex network science .",
