    "understanding the fluctuations of the flux of heat or of the current of particles through systems in their steady state is a central question in non equilibrium statistical mechanics . since the discovery of the fluctuation theorem @xcite",

    "the calculation of this distribution for a given microscopic model remains , however , a challenging issue .",

    ", we measure the flux @xmath2 through a section @xmath3 , located anywhere on the ring in fig.[geom].a ) and half - way between the two heat baths in fig.[geom].b ) ; we also measure the flux @xmath4 averaged over the whole system.,width=377 ]    over the last few years , several exact expressions for the distribution of these fluctuations have nevertheless been obtained for diffusive systems , such as lattice gases @xcite ( for instance the one - dimensional symmetric simple exclusion process ) . for diffusive systems in their steady state , in the two geometries of fig.[geom ] ( the ring geometry in equilibrium at temperature @xmath5 and the open system , i.e.a finite system in contact with two heat baths at temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , the cumulants @xmath8 of the flux of energy @xmath2 during a long time @xmath9 take , for a large system size @xmath10 , the following form :    @xmath11    for the ring geometry ( fig.[geom].a ) , explicit expressions of the prefactors @xmath12 and @xmath13 have been obtained for the symmetric simple exclusion process , as well as for generic diffusive systems with one conserved quantity @xcite . for the open case ( fig.[geom].b ) , the amplitudes @xmath14",
    "are also known for the one - dimensional symmetric exclusion process @xcite ( with expressions identical to those which had been previously determined for disordered one - dimensional conductors @xcite ) ; they are also known for generic diffusive systems with one conserved quantity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath16 for the open case means that diffusive systems satisfy fourier s law @xcite .",
    "together with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , fourier s law also implies the @xmath15 decay of @xmath17 ( or of @xmath18 for @xmath19 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the @xmath10 dependence ( [ dif ] ) of _ all _ the cumulants is generic for diffusive systems , with a few exceptions where some prefactors may vanish and the decay with @xmath10 is faster @xcite .",
    "all these @xmath10 dependencies follow from the fact that , for large diffusive systems , local equilibrium holds and can be treated within the _ macrosopic fluctuation theory _ ( mft ) , a theory of diffusive systems which allows one to calculate explicitly a number of properties of non - equilibrium steady states @xcite . for systems with",
    "more than one conserved quantity , much less has been done so far concerning the cumulants of the current but , as long as the system is diffusive , one expects , from the mft , the same @xmath10 dependencies of the cumulants as in ( [ dif ] ) .",
    "momentum - conserving systems in one dimension are known to exhibit anomalous fourier s law @xcite , with an average current varying as a non trivial power law of the system size @xmath10 : @xmath20 the exponent @xmath21 is not easy to determine @xcite .",
    "it seems to vary with the systems studied ; even for a given system , numerical simulations or theoretical approaches do not always agree .",
    "the current consensus is that several universality classes exist depending on the nature of the non - linearity of the forces between the atoms @xcite .    as major numerical efforts have been already done to determine the exponent @xmath21 ,",
    "our goal here is to present numerical simulations , not to determine @xmath21 more accurately , but rather to look at the @xmath10 dependence of higher cumulants of @xmath2 .",
    "the system we have decided to simulate is a one - dimensional gas @xcite of point particles with hard core interactions .",
    "it was mainly chosen for its simple dynamics : masses follow ballistic motions between successive collisions , which are elastic .",
    "if the particles were all of equal masses , the velocities of colliding particles would simply be exchanged , and the transport of energy would be the same as for an ideal gas ; this is why , as in previous studies of hard particle gases , we chose here a two - mass system , with alternating particles of masses 1 and @xmath22 .    for the ring geometry , we consider an even number @xmath23 of masses on a circle of length @xmath24 , initially in microcanonical equilibrium at fixed energy @xmath25 and zero total momentum : the total energy and the momentum remain of course conserved by the dynamics .    for the open case in contact with two heat baths at unequal ( or equal ) temperatures , we take an odd number @xmath23 of particles in a one - dimensional box of size @xmath24 , and we choose the particles closest to the boundaries to be of mass 1 .",
    "the heat baths at these boundaries are implemented in the following way : whenever a particle hits a boundary , it is reflected as if a thermalized particle was entering the system from the bath , so that the total number of particles in the system remains @xmath23 .",
    "as the steady state is in general not known in the open case , we started our first sample with an initial condition chosen at random ; then , the initial configuration of each new sample was taken to be the final configuration of the previous sample . therefore , apart from transient effects affecting the first samples ( which represent a very small fraction of the total ) , the initial configurations of our samples are typical of steady state configurations .     through a section and",
    "of its space average @xmath4 on a ring of @xmath26 particles ( fig.[fig : fits].a ) . when plotted as functions of @xmath27 ( fig.[fig : fits].b ) ,",
    "the two ratios @xmath28 converge , when @xmath29 , to a common value @xmath30 . ]    through any section of our system , the flux of energy @xmath2 is the algebraic sum of the kinetic energies of the particles crossing the section @xmath3 during a time interval @xmath9 . in the steady state ,",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath2 depend on where the section is located ( at least in the open geometry ) . on the other hand ,",
    "one expects ( under the assumption that the internal energy can not grow indefinitely ) that the long time limit of the ratios @xmath31 are independent of where @xmath2 is measured . in our simulations ,",
    "we measure for the same samples the flux of energy @xmath2 through a fixed section @xmath3 located at position @xmath32 in the open geometry ( and anywhere on the ring geometry ) and its integrated value @xmath4 averaged over the whole system .    as shown in fig.[fig : fits].a ) , the cumulants obtained from these two measurements behave differently at finite time , but both exhibit a linear growth for large @xmath9 .",
    "fig.[fig : fits].b ) shows that , when the ratios @xmath33 are plotted versus @xmath27 , the two sets of data converge to a common value in the long time limit .",
    "this was the case for all the cumulants we were able to measure : for all the results shown below , the procedure of fig.[fig : fits].b ) was used to estimate the asymptotic values of the cumulants @xmath34 .",
    "note that the @xmath27 convergence of fig.2.b ) can easily be understood : if the correlation function @xmath35 of the energy current @xmath36 decays fast enough in the steady state or at equilibrium , then @xmath37 becomes of the form @xmath38 in the large time limit , so that @xmath39 .",
    "+ _ remark : _ all the cumulants we could measure grow linearly with time for large @xmath9 . on the ring geometry , we only observed this growth when performing microcanonical sampling at fixed total energy @xmath40 and momentum @xmath41 ( we took @xmath25 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "when @xmath40 is allowed to fluctuate ( canonical ensemble ) while keeping @xmath42 , the cumulants exhibit a faster growth ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is due to the conservation of @xmath40 by the dynamics on the ring , which introduces non decaying current - current correlations in the long time limit .",
    "fig.[fig : ring ] and [ fig : open ] show the asymptotic values of @xmath44 we obtained for @xmath45 .",
    "the cumulants were calculated by averaging over a number of samples varying from @xmath46 for @xmath47 to @xmath48 for @xmath26 , for the following systems :    * a ring of @xmath49 particles with total kinetic energy @xmath23 and total momentum @xmath50 ; * an open system of @xmath51 particles between two heat baths at temperatures @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; * the same open system between two heat baths at the same temperature @xmath54 .    in all cases , the particle density @xmath55 was exactly @xmath0 .",
    "the mass of the heavier particles , @xmath22 was taken to be @xmath56 ( as in @xcite ) ; when we repeated some of our simulations with a different mass ratio , @xmath57 as in @xcite , we obtained qualitatively similar results ( not shown here ) .",
    "the fourth cumulant of @xmath2 is of course the hardest to obtain : we were only able to measure the asymptotic value of @xmath58 accurately for @xmath59 in the open case .     on a ring of @xmath60 particles of alternating masses 1 and 2.62 , with total energy @xmath23 and total momentum @xmath50 .",
    "while the second cumulant decreases as @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , the fourth cumulant increases with @xmath23 . ]    for the ring geometry , while the second cumulant decays like a power law , the fourth cumulant increases with the system size .",
    "hence the picture is very different from the diffusive case ( [ dif ] ) : in addition to the anomalous fourier s law , we observe an increase of the fourth cumulant instead of a decay .     on an open system with @xmath63 particles , with alternating masses 1 and 2.62 , between heat baths at temperatures @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( fig.[fig : open].a ) and @xmath54 ( fig.[fig : open].b ) .",
    "all cumulants seem to decrease as @xmath61 , with @xmath64 . ]    for the open case , the situation looks more similar to the diffusive case : all the cumulants seem to decrease with comparable power laws of the system size , albeit with a different exponent than in the diffusive case ( [ dif ] ) .",
    "on an open system of @xmath65 particles between heat baths at the same temperature @xmath66 . in a time range increasing with system size , the second cumulant behaves as on an infinite system at equilibrium ( fig.[fig : courts].a ) ; it then exhibits damped oscilllations on time scales of order @xmath23 ( fig.[fig : courts].b ) . ]    in our simulations ( fig.[fig : fits].a ) , we measure the whole time dependence of the cumulants @xmath67 . as fig.[fig : courts ] shows , the short - time behavior of @xmath67 is independent of the system size @xmath23 over a time range which increases with @xmath23 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the fact that , over this time range , the system behaves as if it was infinite : in turn , this allows us to study the behavior of the cumulants on an infinite system .",
    "fig.[fig : courts].a ) shows that , for an infinite system at equilibrium , @xmath68 grows linearly with time ; other results ( not shown here ) indicate that @xmath69 is also linear in time for the same system .",
    "this is another major difference with infinite diffusive systems @xcite , for which all the cumulants of @xmath2 grow asymptotically as @xmath70 .    at intermediate times , all the @xmath71 exhibit periodic oscillations for @xmath72 , with a period proportional to system size ( as can be seen for the second cumulant on fig.[fig : courts].b ) : for the second cumulant",
    ", they can be fitted by an exponentially damped sine function @xcite .",
    "the periods can be understood from the adiabatic sound velocity @xmath73 in the hard particle gas , given by @xmath74 here , @xmath75 ( for an one - dimensional monoatomic gas ) , @xmath76 ( since the average energy , @xmath77 , is taken to be @xmath0 ) , and @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 for @xmath80 . for the open system ,",
    "the period is close to @xmath81 ( shown on fig.[fig : courts].b ) , which is the time for a sound wave originating in @xmath3 to come back to @xmath3 in the same direction , having been reflected once on each boundary ; for the ring , our data ( not shown here ) exhibits a period close to @xmath82 , the time for a sound wave starting from @xmath3 to go around the ring .",
    "in this letter , we have shown that , for a hard particle gas at equilibrium and out of equilibrium , the cumulants of the flux of energy scale as power laws of the system size .",
    "these power laws differ from the ones expected for diffusive systems .",
    "hence , our data shows that the anomalous fourier s law of momentum - conserving systems is also characteristic of higher cumulants of the current . the difference between momentum - conserving and diffusive systems",
    "can also be seen for an infinite system at equilibrium , in which @xmath83 grows as @xmath9 instead of @xmath70 .",
    "more numerical work is certainly needed to accurately determine the exponents characteristic of the cumulants of the energy flux , in particular to check whether , in the open case , all the cumulants decay with the same power law ; one could try to compare the exponents seen for the ring and for the open geometry .",
    "we have focused here on the fluctuations of the flux of energy , which is one of the conserved quantities of this hard particle gas . as momentum is also conserved",
    ", it would be interesting to study the size dependence of the fluctuations of the momentum flux in a similar way",
    ".    it would also be interesting to investigate whether similar power laws of the cumulants can be observed in other momentum - conserving systems , such as anharmonic chains like the fermi - pasta - ulam models ( which are known to exhibit anomalous fourier s law ) .",
    "the study of the cumulants could be a good test for existing theoretical approaches @xcite , such as the mode - coupling theory @xcite . or the boltzmann - langevin equation @xcite .",
    "in particular , one may wonder whether , for momentum - conserving systems , there exists an analog of the universal ratios of the cumulants which are expected for diffusive systems on a ring @xcite",
