    "charged leptons have been used for more than two decades as a very powerful tool for studying the _ momentum structure _ of the nucleon , in a wide variety of experimental approaches .",
    "more recently , high - energy polarised beams and high - density polarised targets have become accessible and have proven to be indispensable tools in studying the _ angular momentum structure _ of the nucleon .",
    "+ at large enough @xmath0 , the four - momentum - transfer squared of the photon mediating the lepton - nucleon interaction , short - range phenomena ( ` hard ' photon - parton interactions ) are successfully described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in contrast , long - range ( ` soft ' ) phenomena and especially parton correlations in hadrons , over a broad range in @xmath0 , are still lacking a satisfactory theoretical description . here",
    "it may be expected that contemporary theoretical developments will at some point turn into a calculable field theoretical description of hadronic structures .",
    "+ the spin of the nucleon as a whole is @xmath1 , irrespectively of the resolving power @xmath0 of the virtual photon .",
    "due to angular momentum conservation in qcd the individual contributions of the parton s spins and orbital angular momenta always add up to this value , although they vary considerably with @xmath0 .",
    "precise measurements at high and especially moderate @xmath0 are required to be able to reliably ` bridge ' into the ` critical ' region of @xmath2 gev@xmath3 to eventually test theoretical descriptions of soft phenomena .",
    "+ in this paper , based on recent theoretical developments in the field , an experimentalist s perspective is given on physics prospects for possible future electron - nucleon fixed - target experiments in the center - of - mass energy range of up to a few tens of gev@xmath3 , with high resolution , high luminosity and polarised beams and/or targets .",
    "the cross section of the inclusive reaction @xmath4 is not yet exactly calculable from theory .",
    "instead it is presently parameterised by non - perturbative ` structure functions ' which in turn , in the framework of the quark - gluon picture of the nucleon , are expressed in terms of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "these functions have proven to be very useful in the description of the momentum and spin structure of partons .",
    "however , they do not yet include the parton s _",
    "angular momenta which are considered to be essential among the various components that eventually make up the half - integer spin of the nucleon .",
    "this striking deficiency is cured in the formalism of ` generalized parton distributions ' ( gpds )  @xcite which reached the level of practical applications only recently .",
    "this theoretical framework is capable of simultaneously treating several types of processes ranging from inclusive to hard exclusive scattering .",
    "exclusive lepton - nucleon scattering is ` non - forward ' in nature since the photon initiating the process is virtual and the final state particle is usually real , forcing a small but finite momentum transfer to the target nucleon .",
    "while it is very appealing that gpds embody forward ( ` ordinary ' ) pdfs as well as nucleon form factors as limiting cases , they clearly contain a wealth of information well beyond these , notably about the hitherto unrevealed orbital angular momenta of partons ( see below ) .",

    "[ fig : gpdwheel ] is intended as an easy - to - read overview        of the various quantities that are considered relevant for a comprehensive description of the angular momentum structure of the nucleon .",
    "it is based on the formalism of gpds which are placed in the middle of three concentric rings .",
    "the two limiting cases are located in the adjacent rings : nucleon form factors , the first moments of their appropriate gpds , are shown in the innermost ring , while pdfs , their ` forward ' limits , are located in the outermost ring .",
