    "although the marscher et al . model makes use of the observed vhe emission in bllac , there is no experimental evidence that would constrain the spatial region of that emission .",
    "our observations connect the vhe emission with the radio emission from the nucleus in m87 and therefore contrain the vhe emission region to lie within the collimation region of the jet , at maximum a few hundred @xmath6 away from the black hole",

    "<S> , m87 provides a unique laboratory in which to study relativistic jet physics in connection with the mechanisms of vhe @xmath1-ray emission in agn .    </S>",
    "<S> vlbi observations of the m87 inner jet show a well resolved , edge - brightened structure extending to within @xmath10 ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) of the core . </S>",
    "<S> closer to the core , the jet has a wide opening angle suggesting that this is the collimation region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the core can be offset from the actual location of the black hole by an unknown amount @xcite , in which case it could mark the location of a shock structure or the region where the jet becomes optically thin . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of m87 a weak structure is seen on the opposite side of the core from the main jet , which may be the counter - jet , based on its morphology and length @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> together with the observed pattern in opening angles , this suggests that the black hole of m87 is located within the central resolution element of the vlbi images , at most a few tens of @xmath6 from the radio core ( see supporting online text ) . along the jet , </S>",

    "<S> the presence of superluminal motions and the strong asymmetry of the jet brightness indicate that the jet flow is relativistic . </S>",
    "<S> the near - stationary components could be related to shocks or instabilities , that can be either stationary , for example if they are the result of interaction with the external medium , or slowly moving if they are the result of instabilities in the flow .    </S>",

    "<S> m87 was detected again with the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) in 2007 @xcite and , recently , the short - term variability was confirmed with the major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov ( magic ) telescope during a strong vhe @xmath1-ray outburst @xcite in february 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> causality arguments imply that the emission region should have a spatial extent of less than @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the relativistic doppler factor . </S>",
    "<S> this rules out explanations for the vhe @xmath1-ray emission on the basis of ( i ) dark matter annihilation @xcite , ( ii ) cosmic - ray interactions with the matter in m87 @xcite , or ( iii ) the knots in the plasma jet ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1]c ) , have been discussed as possible sites @xcite . because the angular resolution of vhe experiments is of the order of @xmath15 , the key to identifying the location of the vhe @xmath1-ray emission lies in connecting it to measurements at other wavebands with considerably higher spatial resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> an angular resolution more than six orders of magnitude better ( less than @xmath16 degrees , corresponding to approximately @xmath17 in case of m87 ) can be achieved with radio observations ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> simultaneously , we monitored m87 with the very long baseline array @xcite ( vlba ) at @xmath20 with a resolution of @xmath21 @xcite , corresponding to about @xmath22 , see @xcite . during the first half of 2008 , </S>",

    "<S> the short - term vhe variability , first observed in 2005 @xcite , is clearly confirmed and the flux reached the highest level observed so far from m87 , amounting to more than @xmath24 of that of the crab nebula . at x - ray frequencies the innermost knot in the jet ( hst-1 ) is found in a low state , whereas in mid february 2008 the nucleus was found in its highest x - ray flux state since 2000 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the 2005 vhe @xmath1-ray flares @xcite , which happened after an increase of the x - ray flux of hst-1 over several years @xcite , allowing speculation that hst-1 might be the source of the vhe @xmath1-ray emission @xcite ; no @xmath25 radio observations were obtained at that time . </S>",
    "<S> given its low x - ray flux in 2008 , hst-1 is an unlikely site of the 2008 vhe flaring activity .    over at least the following two months , until the vlba monitoring project ended , the @xmath20 radio flux density from the region within @xmath26 of the core rose by @xmath27 as compared with its level at the time of the start of the vhe flare and by @xmath28 as compared with the average level in 2007 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of the @xmath25 images corresponds to @xmath22 and the initial radio flux density increase was located in the unresolved core . </S>",
    "<S> the region around the core brightened as the flare progressed ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) , suggesting that new components were emerging from the core . at the end of the observations , </S>",
    "<S> the brightened region extended about @xmath29 from the peak of the core , implying an average apparent velocity of @xmath30 ( @xmath9 is the speed of light ) , well under the approximately @xmath31 seen just beyond that distance in the first half of 2007 . </S>",
    "<S> astrometric results obtained as part of the vlba monitoring program show that the position of the m87 radio peak , relative to m84 , did not move by more than @xmath236  @xmath6 during the flare , suggesting that the peak emission corresponds to the nucleus of m87 .    </S>",
    "<S> because vhe , x - ray and radio flares of the observed magnitude are uncommon , the fact that they happen together ( chance probability of @xmath32 , supporting online text ) is good evidence that they are connected . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by our joint modeling of the vhe and radio light curves : the observed pattern can be explained by an event in the central region causing the vhe flare . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma travels down the jet and the effect of synchrotron self - absorption causes a delay of the observed peak in radio emission because the region is not transparent at radio energies at the beginning of the injection ( supporting online text , sec .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the vlbi structure of the flare along with the timing of the vhe activity , imply that the vhe emission occurred in a region that is small when compared with the vlba resolution . unless a source of infrared radiation is located very close to the central black hole , which is not supported by current observations @xcite , tev @xmath1-ray photons </S>",
    "<S> can escape the central region of m87 without being heavily absorbed through @xmath33 pair production @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the light curve might indicate a rise in radio flux above the range of variations observed in the past , starting before the first vhe flare was detected . </S>",
    "<S> this could imply that the radio emission is coming from portions of the jet launched from further out in the accretion disk than that responsible for the vhe emission . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is difficult to derive a quantitive statement on this , because no vhe data were taken in the week previous to the flaring . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an earlier start of the vhe activity can not be excluded , either .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible injection of plasma at the base of the jet observed at optical and x - ray energies with a delayed passage through the radio core @xmath23@xmath34 further down the jet   interpreted as a standing shock and accompanied by an increase in radio emission   has been discussed in the case of bllac @xcite ( with evidence for vhe emission , see supporting online text for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> m87 is much closer than bllac and has a much more massive black hole , allowing the vlba to start resolving the jet collimation region whose size , from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations @xcite , is thought to extend over @xmath231000  @xmath6 . in case of m87 </S>",
    "<S> the radio core does not appear to be offset by more than the vlba resolution of @xmath2350  @xmath6 from the black hole ( see supporting online text ) and the jet has a larger angle to the line - of - sight than in bllac . </S>",
    "<S> thus the coincidence of the vhe and radio flares ( separated in photon frequency by 16 orders of magnitude ) , constrains the vhe emission to occur well within the jet collimation region .     the support of the namibian authorities and of the university of namibia in facilitating the construction and operation of h.e.s.s . </S>",
