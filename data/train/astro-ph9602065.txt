    "<S> assuming that msw neutrino oscillations occur and ignoring all solar physics except for the constraint that nuclear fusion produces the solar luminosity , we show that new solar neutrino experiments are required to rule out empirically the hypothesis that the sun shines via the cno cycle .    in 1939 </S>",
    "<S> , bethe@xcite showed that the energy required to enable the sun to shine for several billion years could be obtained by two alternative sets of reactions , which have come to be known as the pp chain and the cno cycle . </S>",
    "<S> although bethe s original calculations favored the cno reactions for the solar energy source , detailed solar models developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s indicated that the pp chain was dominant in the sun . </S>",
    "<S> many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) have summarized the specific reactions that occur , according to current understanding , in the pp chain and the cno cycle .    </S>",
    "<S> do solar neutrino experiments confirm the theoretical calculations that indicate that the sun shines primarily by the pp fusion chain ? </S>",
    "<S> the predominant opinion ( to which we also subscribed before doing the calculations described in this paper ) seems to be@xcite that the pp neutrinos have been observed in the gallium solar neutrino experiments , gallex@xcite and sage@xcite , establishing experimentally the predominance of the pp chain . </S>",
    "<S> the reasons for this view include the approximate agreement between the total observed rate in the gallium experiments , @xmath0 snu and the total rate , @xmath1 snu , predicted in the standard solar model ( ssm)@xcite to arise from only the pp ( and pep ) neutrinos . the observed rate is about half the predicted standard rate from all neutrino sources . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the cno cycle contributes only about @xmath2 % to the total solar luminosity in the standard solar model , with the overwhelming contribution ( @xmath3% ) coming from the pp chain . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps even more suggestive is the fact that the rare , high - energy neutrinos , produced in the pp chain , have been observed in the kamiokande experiment@xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    however , there is no direct experimental evidence that pp neutrinos have been detected . </S>",
    "<S> only the gallium experiments have a sufficiently low energy threshold to observe pp neutrinos and these radiochemical experiments do not have any way of recording the energies of the neutrinos that produce @xmath4ge from @xmath4ga . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4ge detected in the gallium experiments could , in principle , be produced by low energy pp neutrinos , by somewhat higher energy cno neutrinos , or by a linear combination of neutrino fluxes from the various nuclear reactions that are believed to create neutrinos in the solar interior .    </S>",
    "<S> the combined predictions of standard electroweak theory and standard solar models provide unique and easily testable consequences , which the existing solar neutrino experiments suggest may be not correct . </S>",
    "<S> once one admits the possibility of new physics altering the solar neutrino spectrum , it becomes much more difficult to make unique inferences from the neutrino experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> we show in this paper that , if neutrino oscillations can occur , the four operating solar neutrino experiments ( chlorine @xcite , kamiokande , gallex , and sage ) are consistent with a hypothetical solar neutrino spectrum in which cno reactions produce essentially all of the solar luminosity . in fact , there is a one - parameter family of such `` solutions '' to the solar neutrino problems . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are inconsistent with the standard solar model , but they are consistent with the luminosity constraint , i. e. , the fusion energy release to the star associated with the neutrino production equals the observed solar luminosity . in addition , we require that our solutions satisfy the inequality @xcite between neutrino fluxes , @xmath5 , that follows from the set of nuclear reactions that produce and neutrinos : @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this inequality expresses the fact that and neutrinos are produced by electron capture on , that itself is produced by the @xmath7 reaction , and that a pp or pep reaction is required to produce each @xmath8 nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we do not require that the ratio of @xmath9 to @xmath10 , or the ratio of the reaction rates for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , be equal to the values computed in a standard solar model .    before describing the solutions , we want to make clear that we do not believe that the sun shines by the cno cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the successes of the standard solar model are too great for us to believe that a radically different solar model could explain all the observations , especially the many thousands of precisely measured helioseismological frequencies that are well described by the standard solar model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of our work is to illustrate the limits of what can be learned from radiochemical solar neutrino experiments , which do not measure the energies of individual events , and to emphasize the importance of future experiments with energy resolution .    </S>",
    "<S> table  [ smallcnotable ] describes the cno analogue of the by - now `` conventional '' small - mixing angle msw solution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional neutrino oscillation solutions presume that the neutrino spectrum created in the interior of the sun is similar to what is predicted by the standard solar model , i.e. , most solar neutrinos are produced by the pp reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions presented here are radically different from what would be implied by a standard solar model . the second column of table  [ smallcnotable ] </S>",
    "<S> gives the ratio of the total flux from each neutrino source to the maximum flux from that source permitted by the luminosity constraint , are@xcite : @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; and @xmath17 . in the specific solution described in the table , </S>",
    "<S> the pp neutrinos represent 0.05% of the total solar luminosity ; the cno neutrinos [ @xmath18 correspond to 99.95% of the total energy output . </S>",
    "<S> the total neutrino flux ( all flavors ) is about 1.5 times the standard solar model flux@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the third , fourth , and fifth columns give the fractional contribution of each neutrino source to the total observed rate in each of the operating experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the last two rows of table  [ smallcnotable ] show that the observed and the calculated event rates are in excellent agreement .    </S>",
    "<S> the cno solutions were found by a computer search that considered ( over a numerical grid ) all relevant values of the neutrino fluxes , and mixing parameters , that are consistent with the luminosity constraint . after choosing a ( large ) cno flux , </S>",
    "<S> the flux was selected to lie within the range that can be consistent with the kamiokande experiment ( taking account of the quoted experimental errors and the possibility that neutrino oscillations may occur ) . since the adopted cno flux is large , the luminosity constraint bounds the pp and fluxes to such small values that they do not contribute significantly to the event rates in any of the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> there is therefore a one - parameter family ( an infinite set ) of cno solutions in which the small residual luminosity is divided between pp and neutrinos . for the explicit solution given in table  [ smallcnotable ] , we ( arbitrarily ) maximized the contribution to the luminosity not associated with cno and neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> for each chosen set of neutrino fluxes , standard techniques were used to compute the survival probabilities@xcite for electron - type neutrinos and then to compare the calculated event rates(see@xcite ) in the four operating experiments with the observed rates .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ survival ] shows the computed survival probability as a function of energy for the cno solution given in table  [ smallcnotable ] . </S>",
    "<S> the survival probability is defined as the probability that an electron - type neutrino created in the sun will be detected as an electron - type neutrino when it reaches the earth . </S>",
    "<S> because different neutrino sources are produced at somewhat different positions in the solar interior , the computed survival probability at a given neutrino energy depends slightly upon which neutrino source one is considering . the specific curve shown in figure  [ survival ] was computed for @xmath19b neutrinos . for our purposes , it is a good approximation to consider the illustrated survival probability as generic .    </S>",
    "<S> the survival probability is small in the region ( 1 mev to 10 mev ) that is most important for the neutrinos ; it is approximately @xmath20 for neutrinos with energies above @xmath21 mev . for the @xmath22 mev @xmath23be line , </S>",
    "<S> the survival probability is @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the survival probability rises steeply at energies below the threshold ( @xmath25 mev ) of the homestake detector . </S>",
    "<S> the average energies of the and the neutrinos are , respectively , 0.7 mev and 1.0 mev and the end point energies are 1.2 mev and 1.7 mev . therefore , the cno contribution to the chlorine detector is strongly suppressed ( by about a factor of 34 ) , while the cno contribution to the gallium experiments is somewhat less suppressed ( by a factor of about 9 ) . in this way , the low energy neutrinos from the cno cycle can produce a signal in the gallium detectors that is comparable to the predicted pp signal in the standard model calculations , without producing an excessive contribution in the chlorine detector .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ allowedmsw ] shows the neutrino parameters for the msw solutions that correspond to at least @xmath26% of the solar luminosity being produced by cno neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit cno solution is indicated by a dark circle in figure  [ allowedmsw ] and the conventional ( pp - dominated ) solutions@xcite are indicated by dark triangles . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the familiar msw plots in which the standard solar model is assumed to be valid ( within estimated uncertainties ) , the flux is treated as a free parameter in the calculations that give the results shown in figure  [ allowedmsw ] . for specificity , we required @xmath27 for the fits to the operating experiments used in drawing the contours in figure  [ allowedmsw ] ; this requirement corresponds to a 95% confidence level for the two neutrino mixing parameters ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum value of @xmath30 for the best - fitting parameters is @xmath31 ( cno solution ) , which can be compared with @xcite @xmath32 ( small mixing angle pp - based solution ) and @xmath33 ( large mixing angle pp - based solution ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate in this paper on the most extreme cases in which essentially all the solar luminosity is generated by the cno cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the computer search did find , of course , other sets of solutions in which the cno contribution can range anywhere from 0% to almost 100% .    </S>",
    "<S> the lack of an observed day - night effect in the kamiokande experiment@xcite rules out a large mixing - angle `` essentially all '' cno solution . </S>",
    "<S> the average rates ( ignoring day - night differences ) in the four operating solar experiments are consistent with a cno solution and neutrino parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this ruled - out cno solution is the analogue of the conventional large mixing angle ( pp - dominated ) msw solution shown in figure  [ allowedmsw ] , but the unacceptable cno solution has a smaller @xmath28 and mixing angle than the conventional large mixing angle solution .    </S>",
    "<S> the survival probabilities depend somewhat on the calculated density profile and the neutrino production regions that are derived from a solar model , and therefore are slightly model dependent . the allowed regions were computed using survival probabilities calculated for three different solar models : 1995@xcite , 1992@xcite , and 1988@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ allowedmsw ] shows that the final numerical results are not sensitive to which reference solar model is used </S>",
    "<S> .    the critical reader may object that we have not presented a self - consistent solution for which the neutrino survival probabilities are computed from a detailed solar model in which the energy production is dominated by cno reactions . </S>",
    "<S> this objection is valid . </S>",
    "<S> our goal in writing this paper is to show that solar neutrino experiments with the ability to measure the energies of individual low - energy events are required in order to establish empirically that the sun shines by the pp , not the cno , reactions . </S>",
    "<S> we are not trying to present a self - consistent cno - based solar model . </S>",
    "<S> when all the correct physics is included in a detailed solar model , the theoretical calculations show that the energy production is dominated by pp not cno reactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , helioseismological measurements indicate@xcite that the solar sound velocity ( closely related to the density profile ) does not differ significantly ( less than or of order a percent ) from the standard model profile , as far as the helioseismological measurements have probed ( down to about 10% of the solar radius ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , if there were a self - consistent cno model that agreed with the helioseismological measurements , then it would have a density profile similar to the standard models used here .    </S>",
    "<S> cno solutions can be found with a wide range for the ratio of electron capture to proton capture on , which determines the ratio , @xmath36 , of to neutrino fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> the specific solution given in table  [ smallcnotable ] has @xmath37 , but we have found solutions with @xmath36 values varying from @xmath38 to @xmath39 ( in the latter case @xmath3% of the solar luminosity is in the form of cno neutrinos ) . </S>",
    "<S> larger values of @xmath36 can be found if one is willing to consider solutions in which the fraction , @xmath40 , of the solar luminosity that derives from pp reactions exceeds 2% ( @xmath41 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming vacuum neutrino oscillations can occur ( but not msw oscillations ) , we have not been able to find solutions , consistent with the luminosity constraint , in which the cno energy generated dominated the solar energy production . </S>",
    "<S> the largest cno contribution we found was 12% of the solar luminosity ; this value corresponds to vacuum oscillation parameters of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum oscillation solutions have characteristically oscillatory behavior as a function of neutrino energy , which makes it difficult to supress electron - type neutrinos over a very large range of energies ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ survival ] ) .    for solar neutrino experiments under development , table  [ newcnotable ] gives in the second column the event rates predicted by the `` essentially - all '' msw - cno solution . </S>",
    "<S> assuming for comparison the correctness of the standard solar model ( in which nearly all the energy is produced by the pp chain ) , columns three , four , and five , give the predicted rates @xcite for the conventional msw and vacuum neutrino oscillation solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars in table  [ newcnotable ] were computed @xcite by allowing @xmath28 and @xmath44 to vary over the range that is consistent , at 95% confidence level , with the four operating solar neutrino experiments . for the cno solution , the total neutrino flux varies between @xmath45 and @xmath46 times the standard model value .    </S>",
    "<S> table  [ newcnotable ] shows that measurements of the neutrino rates by superkamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite , and icarus@xcite will not be able to rule out the essentially - all cno msw solution . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , these experiments are expected to be able to demonstrate definitively if physics beyond the simplest version of standard electroweak theory is required to describe solar neutrino experiments and , if new physics is required , to make relatively accurate determinations of some neutrino mixing parameters with only modest guidance from theoretical models .    </S>",
    "<S> three future experiments , borexino @xcite , hellaz @xcite , and heron @xcite , have been proposed that would measure directly the fluxes of low energy solar neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> borexino is designed to take advantage of the characteristic ` box ' shape@xcite of the recoil electron energy spectrum from a neutrino line , @xmath23be . </S>",
    "<S> the cno solution predicts that @xmath23be neutrinos will be unobservable in borexino , with an interaction rate of @xmath47 the standard model prediction . </S>",
    "<S> hellaz and heron are intended to measure the fundamental pp neutrinos , which the cno solution predicts to be unobservably rare , @xmath48 the standard model prediction . </S>",
    "<S> borexino , hellaz , and heron should all observe , according to the cno solution , a low - energy continuous spectrum dominated by neutrinos from @xmath49n and @xmath50o decay . </S>",
    "<S> the cno contribution to the event rate would be about three times the event rate predicted by the standard model in the relevant energy ranges ( @xmath51 kev to @xmath52 kev for @xmath23be neutrinos in borexino , @xmath53 kev to @xmath54 kev for pp neutrinos in hellaz / heron ) .    in conclusion , we want to stress again that we have ignored in this paper all considerations based upon either theoretical solar models or helioseismology . </S>",
    "<S> we have focused instead on what can be inferred empirically from solar neutrino experiments if neutrino oscillations occur . </S>",
    "<S> if neutrino oscillations occur , then experiments with powerful diagnostic capabilities ( high counting rates , good energy and time resolution for individual events ) are required in order to determine empirically the solar neutrino spectrum . </S>"
