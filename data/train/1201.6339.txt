    "complex network models of the interactions in human society have been used to understand many problems in epidemiology  @xcite .",
    "these models have generally assumed that all of the nodes interact on a single network with a single degree distribution .",
    "even when these degree distributions allow for large heterogeneities  as in the case of scale - free networks  @xcite , where hubs with large numbers of connections can arise  the assumption remains that every node is part of a single network and is represented by a single underlying topology . in reality , however , societies are composed of many interconnected networks , as in fig .  [ interconnecting ] , which may be communities within a larger population or separate systems entirely .",
    "a disease can spread through the network of direct personal contacts , via the water utilities network , and through travel from city to city over highway or airline networks .",
    "these interconnected network systems may be comprised of different types of nodes , which may have degrees drawn from distinct degree distributions , and may have different connectivities between them .",
    "real world examples of these systems can be seen in a 2009 study by stehl et .",
    "al . which found a three fold difference in interaction time between students inside and outside of their own class  @xcite .",
    "other studies have shown similar patterns  @xcite .",
    "human - animal interacting network systems are also of great importance . the h5n1 variant of influenza spreads through the network of birds , and from them to individuals in the network of humans that work or live closely with them .",
    "while no current mechanism exists for efficient spreading from human to human , there is substantial concern that such a mechanism will evolve  @xcite .",
    "human - mosquito - human transmission for the _ p. knowlesi _ malaria strain is also a worrying concern  @xcite .",
    "interconnected network systems have been of interest to researchers in numerous different ways  @xcite .",
    "interconnected dependency networks , where failure in nodes in one network causes failures of dependent nodes in the other network , exhibit failure cascades , where the cross network dependencies result in a network much more easily fragmented than single networks of the same degree distribution  @xcite . interconnected power networks , where transport capacity and failure vulnerability are competing properties , were examined and an optimal level of interconnection found  @xcite .",
    "networks without dependencies , such as interconnected social networks , where populations exist at city , state , and national levels , have also been examined . in these networks , the level of movement between cities ( the interconnections between them ) have been shown to affect the epidemic transition on the metapopulation level @xcite , although in this case the low - level networks were treated in a mean field fashion , classified only by rate equations and infection numbers , with no internal network features .",
    "in addition , the percolation threshold in interacting networks was found to be lower than in single networks , with a giant cluster appearing for a smaller total number of links  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider two interconnected networks ( or , alternately , interconnected communities within a single , larger network ) .",
    "we pose the question : under what conditions will an epidemic spread only on the sub - networks , with minimal isolated infections on other network components , and under what conditions will it spread across the entire interconnected network system ? depending on the parameters of the individual networks and their interconnections , connecting one network to another can have a profound or a small effect on the spread of an epidemic . identifying the conditions in which these cases occur is vital to our understanding and management of epidemic processes .",
    ", width=302,height=188 ]    we define two different interconnected network regimes , strongly and weakly coupled , and find the interaction strength value separating these two regimes .",
    "our primary result is to show that in the strongly - coupled case , we find that all networks are simultaneously either disease free or part of an epidemic , while in the weakly - coupled case a new  mixed \" phase can exist . in this mixed phase , the disease is epidemic on only one network , and not in other networks , despite the interconnections .",
    "the applications to public health are straightforward .",
    "if two neighboring communities comprise a strongly - coupled network system , then an outbreak in any community is cause for immediate concern in the other . due to this , in the strongly - coupled case it becomes important to pursue a strategy of communication and joint action between public health agencies , and perhaps even intervention from a single agency with higher authority .",
    "in this section , we consider the case of only two interconnected networks of equal size , but it is easily possible to extend the model to an arbitrary number of networks of any size .",
    "we form our interconnected network systems in the following way :    1 .   generate two networks , a and b , with their own intranetwork ( a @xmath1 a and b @xmath1 b ) degree distributions @xmath2 and @xmath3 according to the standard molloy - reed configuration model  @xcite .",
    "2 .   draw a degree from the internetwork ( a @xmath1 b ) degree distribution , @xmath4 , for all the nodes in both networks .",
    "if the total degree assigned to nodes in network a is not equal to the total degree assigned to nodes in network b , randomly reassign a node in b until the total numbers in each network are equal .",
    "4 .   randomly connect nodes in network a to nodes in network b to form the interconnected network system .",
    "this method generates random , uncorrelated , interconnected network systems with specified inter- and intra - network degree distributions . while this method works for any arbitrary degree distribution , @xmath5 , we present results only for random poissonian degree distributions .",
    "the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) epidemic model is used here to study the effects of interconnected network structure on epidemic threshold .",
    "the sir model is well established and describes diseases such as hpv , seasonal influenza , or h1n1  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "each node has three possible states : susceptible ( @xmath6 ) , infected ( @xmath7 ) , or recovered ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "each node begins in state @xmath6 , except for a single node in one network chosen to be in state @xmath7 .",
    "nodes in state @xmath7 infect their neighbors in state @xmath6 with probability @xmath9 at each time step , changing them to @xmath7 .",
    "nodes enter state @xmath8 after spending a recovery time @xmath10 in state @xmath7 .    in order to find the threshold for an epidemic",
    ", we can think of epidemic spreading as a bond percolation process  @xcite on a network . in bond percolation",
    ", links between nodes are activated with a certain probability @xmath11 . if this probability is greater than a certain critical value , @xmath12 , then a giant cluster emerges , where the existence of a path between any two nodes is almost certain . in a disease - spreading model ,",
    "nodes infect their neighbors ,  activating \" the links between them with a certain probability , and a disease reaches nodes through this entire network above a certain critical value , @xmath0 , just as in the case for percolation .    in complex networks , this critical threshold for percolation",
    "if all potential links are activated is @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the expected number of nearest neighbors that a node chosen by following an arbitrary link will have , and is calculated from the ratio between the second and the first moments of the degree distribution : @xmath15 . for @xmath16 , a giant cluster exists , while for @xmath17 only small isolated clusters exist .",
    "if some subset of bonds is activated at random with probability @xmath11 , a giant cluster appears at a critical value of @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the sir model likewise has an epidemic phase transition at a critical @xmath19 below which the disease remains confined to the local neighborhood of the initial infection , and above which the disease spreads throughout the network .",
    "this transition from the disease - free phase to the epidemic phase depends on the average number of secondary infections per infected node becoming larger than one .",
    "this allows the long - term survival of the disease , as the infection density will grow over time on average , and thus ensure that the epidemic spreads to a large fraction of the population . in our problem , the expected number of susceptible neighbors that a node has when it just becomes infected is given by @xmath20 , since the total expected number of neighbors is @xmath14 , and one of them must be excluded as the infected parent from which the current node descended .",
    "the transmissiblity @xmath21 is the probability to infect a neighbor before recovery .",
    "the mean number of secondary infections per infected node is thus @xmath22 the infection will die out if each infected node does not infect on average at least one replacement so , for a very large network , the critical point is given by the relation @xmath23 .",
    "the single network model exhibits only a single transition at @xmath0 given by @xcite @xmath24^{1/t_r}. \\label{transition}\\ ] ] in the interconnected network model , the behavior is more complicated , as the disease can potentially cause an epidemic in different combinations of the networks",
    ". the disease can either be in the epidemic phase in both networks , in the disease - free phase in both networks , or active in one network while the other remains disease free , called here the mixed phase .",
    "the boundaries of these phases are controlled by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are calculated over the individual a and b networks , disregarding internetwork connections , and @xmath27 is calculated over the entire coupled network system , including intra- and inter- network links .",
    "we consider an interconnected network system to be strongly coupled if @xmath27 is larger than @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . for random networks , @xmath28 , and",
    "thus we may write @xmath27 in terms of the average degrees @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 as follows : @xmath32\\\\ & & [ \\langle k_a \\rangle + \\langle k_b \\rangle + 2\\langle k_{ab } \\rangle ] ^{-1}. \\label{kappa_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] without loss of generality , we define network @xmath33 as the more intraconnected network ( @xmath34 ) . for fixed network parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we can then derive the critical interaction strength @xmath35 that separates strongly - coupled ( @xmath36 ) from weakly - coupled ( @xmath37 ) networks : @xmath38 in strongly - coupled network systems , we expect any epidemic to emerge simultaneously on networks a and b. using eq .",
    "[ transition ] for each of the three @xmath14 , it can be seen that for the strongly - coupled case @xmath39 , the critical value of @xmath9 for the disease to emerge on the giant component formed by the entire interconnected network , is smaller than both @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the critical values of @xmath9 for epidemics to spread on networks a or b ignoring internetwork links .",
    "as such , any pathogen virulent enough to spread in network a or b alone will have already caused an epidemic occurring across the interconnected network system .",
    "for this case , the disease spreads across the interconnected network system as a single network , with the internetwork connections bringing an epidemic into existence before any intranetwork connections can do so independently ; the mixed phase will not be seen . to support this , we plot the ratio of the largest connected infected cluster formed solely from nodes connected with intranetwork links , compared to the size of the largest connected cluster formed by nodes connected with all links , in fig . [ cluster ] . for a strongly - coupled network system ,",
    "the relative size of the largest connected infected component contained entirely in a single network decreases initially , showing that the epidemic is occurring across the interconnected network system , not locally in one of the networks .",
    "thus in the strongly - coupled case , epidemic spreading is enhanced due to internetwork connections , with epidemics occurring for less virulent diseases than would spread on either network alone ( lower @xmath0 . )",
    "one note is that for networks of identical intranetwork degree ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43 . that is to say , identical networks always form strongly - coupled network systems",
    "this is in agreement with our findings that the phase diagram of strongly - coupled network systems is similar to that of single networks .",
    "an interacting network system formed by attaching the labels a and b to different halves of a single network would be such an example system , and one should not expect that this relabeling could have any effect on the physical properties , such as phase transitions , of that network .",
    "if two networks are connected with @xmath44 below the threshold value from eq .",
    "[ threshold ] , i.e. @xmath45 , we define the interconnected network system to be weakly coupled . from eq .",
    "[ kappa_t ] this also gives @xmath46 .",
    "turning again to eq .",
    "[ transition ] we see that @xmath47 .",
    "epidemic spreading is a non - competitive process . adding more links to a network",
    "can only increase the spread of an epidemic , never decrease it , as the chance of a node infecting its neighbors is constant regardless of degree .",
    "thus , a disease with @xmath9 above the individual epidemic threshold of network b ( @xmath48 will enter the epidemic phase on that network , regardless of the other network and the values of @xmath27 and @xmath25 . if @xmath9 is below @xmath39 , however , the disease can not spread to more than isolated small clusters of network a. thus , in the weakly - coupled case , we expect to see a mixed phase , with the boundaries dependent on the values of @xmath9 and @xmath31 .",
    "a mixed phase indicates that the addition of the interconnections between the two networks is only affecting epidemic spreading on the network with weaker intranetwork connections , with the epidemic on the network with stronger intranetwork connections unchanged by the internetwork links . the weakly - coupled case in fig .",
    "[ cluster ] shows this , with the largest connected cluster contained entirely in b becoming larger compared to the size of the giant component with increasing @xmath9 until @xmath39 is reached , indicating that the disease does not spread through connected regions of network a.    if @xmath9 is increased to above @xmath39 , network b becomes capable of spreading the disease to network a , which now enters the epidemic phase , even for @xmath49 .",
    "this matches the work done by leicht and dsouza  @xcite where a giant cluster forms consisting of nodes in both networks , even when the less intraconnected network is below its own percolation threshold .",
    "we plot the full phase diagram for both weakly- and strongly - coupled networks in fig .",
    "[ phase ] , showing the disease - free phase , the mixed phase , the epidemic phase , and the transition between weakly- and strongly coupled networks .",
    "the existence of this mixed phase is important in the real - world context of interacting networks , as the communities or systems that comprise the components are likely to be governed by different bodies .",
    "if two cities , for example , together form a weakly - coupled network system , the more highly connected city can more safely disregard the links to , and response of , the less highly connected city , as the spread of the epidemic will depend on local parameters only .",
    "we performed monte - carlo simulations to verify this result .",
    "first , fig .",
    "[ gap ] , shows infection densities at different @xmath9 , corresponding to a horizontal sweep across the phase diagram seen in fig .",
    "[ phase ] at @xmath50 .",
    "the epidemic spreading first occurs at @xmath41 , where the disease enters the epidemic phase and spreads through network b , while the infection density in network a remains negligible .",
    "this mixed region , in agreement with our predictions , occurs in the region @xmath51 . in this regime ,",
    "network a plays no role in the spreading of the infection on network b. above @xmath39 , we see that the infection density in network a begins to rise , showing that the entire interconnected network system is now in the epidemic phase , as predicted .     for networks approaching the strongly - coupled regime from below",
    ", the mixed phase is expected to be small , and thus difficult to identify from graphs such as the one in fig .",
    "we thus examine not only the infection densities , but also the survival probability @xmath52 , which is the probability of an infection started from a single infected site being active at a time @xmath53 .",
    "equivalently and more accessible from public health records , the distribution of time spans of reported outbreaks can be used . at criticality ,",
    "the probability of an infection started from a single infected site remaining active at a later time @xmath53 is expected to scale as @xmath54@xcite .",
    "fig.[p(t)4 ] , shows the survival probabilities of the networks comprising an interconnected with @xmath55 for both the strongly- and weakly - coupled cases . in both cases ,",
    "network b exhibits the expected @xmath56 fall - off in survivability with time that is expected of a system at criticality , indicating that network b is actually undergoing a phase transition at the disease - free / mixed phase line . in the weakly - coupled case , however , the survival probability in network a does not fall off as expected , due to infrequent and non - epidemic instances of infections from network b. the slope of the survival probability for network a thus can not be used directly to confirm when it enters the epidemic phase .",
    "however , if both networks are participating in an epidemic , the disease should be active in both networks at each time step .",
    "we thus introduce the survival probability gap ( inset of fig .",
    "[ p(t)4 ] ) , @xmath57 /p(t)\\right]$ ] , or the minimum relative difference in the likelihoods that each network will have any infected members ( nodes in class @xmath7 ) present at time @xmath53 .",
    "we use this quantity to measure the deviations of the survival probability in network a from the value that is obtained from a network at criticality ( network b ) and thus of how far away network a is from it s own critical point .    in fig .",
    "[ p_gap_vanish ] we plot this survival gap at different @xmath9 , equivalent to vertical slices across the phase diagram seen in fig .  [ phase ] .",
    "we see that when @xmath44 or @xmath9 is increased to move outside the expected mixed phase region and into the epidemic phase , @xmath58 goes to zero . in other words , at the mixed / epidemic phase line , network a is behaving identically to a network known to be at criticality , and thus can be said to itself be critical along that line .",
    "this confirms the assertion that there can only be a gap in survival probability when one network is in the epidemic phase and the other is not , i.e. in the mixed phase .",
    "thus a non - zero survival probability gap can serve as a good predictor for the presence of the mixed phase .",
    "lastly , we addressed the question of universality under different values of inter- and intra - network degree , finding that along the disease - free / mixed phase transition line , the behavior of networks with different @xmath14 is universal under appropriate scaling .",
    "fig.[p_universal ] shows three different networks , all with @xmath59 and @xmath55 .",
    "rescaling the survival probabilities by @xmath60 and plotting vs. @xmath61 instead of @xmath27 directly , the curves collapse , showing @xmath58 , and thus the mixed phase , disappear uniformly as the network approaches the strongly - coupled regime ( @xmath36 and @xmath62 . ) near the critical point , @xmath63^{-1}$ ] ( fit not shown . ) this identical behavior implies survival probabilities in networks could be used as as a measure of network connectivities near criticality , as the latter may be difficult to obtain for social and biological networks , whereas information on the duration of an epidemic outbreak in various communities ( from which @xmath52 can be estimated ) is likely to be recorded .",
    "in addition , the survival probability gap persists well beyond @xmath64 , for appropriate @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for the system with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "even when every node in network a is connected to two or more nodes in network b , there can still be an order of magnitude difference at minimum in the likelihood of finding the disease active in the two networks ; the mixed phase region is not confined to small @xmath44 only .",
    "in summary , we introduced two classes for interconnected network systems , strongly coupled and weakly coupled , and studied the behavior of epidemics on them . in strongly - coupled network systems , epidemics occur always across the entire interacting network system , with the presence of interconnections enhancing epidemic spreading . in weakly - coupled network systems",
    ", a mixed phase exists where epidemics do not always occur across the full interconnected network system , and interconnections affect only epidemic spreading across the less intraconnected network . we demonstrated the boundaries and behavior of the mixed phase numerically as well as analytically . proper analysis of which groups of communities comprise strongly- or weakly - coupled systems could inform public policy and highlight the necessity of cooperation between different governing bodies or provide information about the epidemic danger of increasing interaction between human and animal populations .",
