    "measurements of differential cross sections as a function of top quark related kinematic quantities are tests of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and probe a variety of different properties , for instance the @xmath1 distribution is sensitive to higher order effects like initial / final state radiation of quarks or gluons . moreover",
    ", possible deviations in the shapes of all distributions can provide a hint of physics beyond the sm .",
    "top quarks are mostly produced in pairs via the strong interaction in hadron colliders . at lhc energies ,",
    "the dominant mechanism is gluon - gluon fusion , corresponding to @xmath280% of the generation process .",
    "top quarks can also be produced singly , via the electroweak interaction .",
    "the three modes of single top quark production are t - channel , tw - associated production and s - channel .",
    "the top quark decays almost exclusively into a w boson and a b quark and it is the decay of the w bosons what defines the final state .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 signatures can be classified according to the combinatorics of the w boson decay .",
    "the @xmath0 measurements presented here are performed in the dilepton channel , where the @xmath0 final states include events with two leptons , two neutrinos and two b jets , and/or in the lepton+jets channels , with one lepton , one neutrino and four jets , out of which two arise from b quarks .",

    "the measurements presented in this report are performed in the lepton+jets and/or the dilepton decay channels .",
    "the top quark kinematic properties are obtained through kinematic fitting and reconstruction algorithms .",
    "the measurements are corrected for detector and hadronisation effects back to particle or parton level , using a regularised unfolding procedure .",
    "theory predictions and calculations are compared to the differential cross sections , absolute or normalised to the in - situ measured absolute cross section , @xmath3 , extrapolated to the full phase space or in the visible phase space , in order to minimise the dependence on theory input .",
    "the measurements have been performed as a function of several kinematic distributions of top quark , @xmath0 , ( b)-jets , leptons , lepton pairs , etc . here , few examples of results for variables related to the top quark and @xmath0 are discussed .",
