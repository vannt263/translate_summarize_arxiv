    "for the quantized massive fields in the large mass limit , i. e. , when the compton length is much smaller than the characteristic radius of a curvature , the nonlocal contribution to the effective action can be neglected , and the series expansion in @xmath1 of the renormalized effective action , @xmath2 may be easily constructed with the aid of the dewitt - schwinger method  [ 1,2 ] . as the renormalization prescription requires absorbtion of the first three terms of the series into the quadratic classical gravitational action , the @xmath3 term of @xmath4 is proportional to the integrated coincidence limit of the hadamard - minakshisundaram - dewitt - seely coefficient ( hmds ) @xmath5 unfortunately",
    ", the complexity of the coefficients @xmath6 $ ] rapidly increases with @xmath7 and consequently one expects that the applicability of the series expansion is confined to a first , perhaps a second nonvanishing term .    having constructed a first order @xmath2 the renormalized stress - energy tensor ( which is the most important characteristics of the quantized field in the curved spacetime ) may be obtained in a standard way , i. e. , by functional differentiating the constructed effective action with respect to the metric tensor .",
    "this method has been successfully applied in calculations of the approximate renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive scalar , spinor , and vector fields in the vacuum type - d geometries by frolov and zelnikov  [ 3 - 7 ] .",
    "a different method , based on the wkb approximation of the solutions of the massive scalar field equation in a general spherically - symmetric spacetime , and summation thus obtained modes by means of the abel - plana formula , has been invented by anderson , hiscock , and samuel and applied in the context of the rn spacetime  [ 8 ] .",
    "their method is equivalent to the schwinger - dewitt expansion : to obtain the lowest ( i. e. @xmath1 ) terms , one has to use sixth - order wkb approximation .",
    "moreover , numerical calculations reported in ref.[8 ] confirmed that the dewitt - schwinger method provide a good approximation of the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the massive scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling as long as the mass of the field remains sufficiently large .",
    "this approach and its modifications has been employed in various contexts in refs.[9 - 15 ] .",
    "recently , extending the results of frolov - zelnikov , we have constructed a general formula describing the approximate renormalized @xmath8 of the quantized massive scalar , spinor , and vector fields in arbitrary spacetime .",
    "the results have been presented for the class of geometries with vanishing curvature scalar , and subsequently applied in the spacetime of the rn black hole and in the spacetime that could be obtained by expanding its near horizon geometry into a whole manifold  [ 16 ] .",
    "our formulas allow , in principle , to determine the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the massive field once the line element has been chosen , although the specific calculations may be very tedious .",
    "for the quantized massive scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling in the rn spacetime we have reproduced the results of anderson , hiscock , and samuel ; neutral spinor and vector fields have not been discussed earlier .    in this paper we shall extend the analyses of ref.[16 ] to the general geometry and construct the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the massive quantized scalar field obeying the equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the coupling constant and @xmath11 is the mass of the field .",
    "since the background geometry is general , the most direct approach is to use the first nonvanishing term of the renormalized effective action .",
    "the advantage of this approach lies in the purely geometric nature of the approximation that reflects its local nature .",
    "although the constructed result is rather complex , we shall present it in its full length , because it provides the generic formula from which the renormalized stress - energy tensor in some physically interesting cases may be easily obtained .",
    "as the effective action of the quantized massive scalar field differs form the analogous actions constructed for fields of higher spins only by numerical coefficients , one can generalize presented results to fields of other spins .",
    "it should be emphasized however , that the method has obvious limitations , and , when applied to rapidly varying or strong gravitational fields it breaks down .",
    "moreover , its massless limit is contaminated by nonphysical divergences .",
    "our general formulas will be employed in the calculations of @xmath12 in the geometry of the electrically charged black hole , being an exact solution of the coupled system of the einstein equations and the equations of the nonlinear electrodynamics recently proposed by ayn - beato and garca ( abg ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which the reader is referred for physical motivations and technical details .",
    "their exact solution is characterized by the electric charge , @xmath13 and the mass @xmath14 and may be elegantly expressed in terms of the hyperbolic functions .",
    "an important and interesting feature of this solution is its regularity as radial coordinate tends to zero .",
    "we shall show that the structure of horizons of the abg solution may by studied by means of the lambert function  @xcite , allowing analytical treatment of the vacuum polarization effects on the event horizon .",
    "at large distances their solution behaves as the rn solution . for small and intermediate values of the ratio @xmath15 the location of the event horizon",
    ", @xmath16 is close to the location of the event horizon of the rn black hole ; significant differences occur near the extremality limit .",
    "it would be , therefore , interesting to analyze how the similarities of the line elements are reflected in the behavior of the renormalized stress - energy tensors .",
    "the renormalized effective action of the massive scalar field involves the terms that are proportional to the first and third power of @xmath17 as the curvature scalar of the rn spacetime vanishes , @xmath18 of the massive scalar field naturally divides into the part that describes pure conformal coupling and an additional local part that is multiplied by a factor @xmath19 on the other hand however , the curvature scalar of the abg geomerty does not vanish , and the structure of the effective action indicates that the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the massive scalar depends on the constant @xmath10 in a more complicated way . since the conformal coupling leads to massive simplifications , one expects that the similarities in the renormalized @xmath18 ( if any ) would appear mainly in this case .",
    "the renormalized effective action constructed for the quantized scalar field satisfying equation ( 1 ) is given by @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 $ ] is the coincidence limit of the @xmath21th hdsm coefficient .",
    "the first three coefficients of the dewitt - schwinger expansion , @xmath22 which contribute to the divergent part of the action have to be absorbed in the classical gravitational action by renormalization of the bare coupling constant .    as the rigorous asymptotic analysis of the fundamental solution",
    "is restricted , in general , to the heat operator of a parabolic type , we tacitly assume that all steps that are necessary in construction of the first - order renormalized stress - energy tensor have been carried out in an analytically continued euclidean spacetime . the analytic continuation to the physical space is performed at the last stage of the calculations .",
    "calculation of the hdsm coefficients is an extremely laborious task , and their exact form for @xmath23 is unknown .",
    "the coefficient @xmath24,$ ] which is proportional to the trace anomaly of the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized , massless , and conformally invariant fields , has been calculated by dewitt  @xcite . the coincidence limit of the coefficient @xmath25 has been obtained by gilkey [ 19,20 ] whereas the coefficient @xmath26 $ ] has been calculated by avramidi [ 21 - 24 ] .",

    "however , it still could by of use in the simpler analyses of the field fluctuation , @xmath33 .",
    "substituting ( 4 - 6 ) into ( 3 ) , integrating by parts and making use of elementary properties of the riemann tensor , one can reduce the number of terms in the renormalized effective action to ten  @xcite :    @xmath34 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & { 1\\over 192 \\pi^{2 } m^{2}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{10 } { \\alpha}_{i } w_{i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 are numerical coefficients that stand in front of the geometrical terms .",
    "the renormalized stress - energy tensor is given by the standard relation @xmath36 functionally differentiating the renormalized effective action with respect to the metric tensor , performing simplifications and necessary symmetrizations , after rather long calculations , one has @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 as there are numerous identities involving the riemann tensor , its covariant derivatives and contractions , the form of @xmath47 is , of course , not unique and depends on adopted simplification strategies .",
    "here we presented our results in the form that we have found useful in the further calculations .",
    "it should be noted that the resulting renormalized stress - tensor of the massive scalar field depends on the coupling constant in a complicated way , and in a general spacetime it divides naturally into four terms @xmath48 where    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    and @xmath53 inspection of eqs .",
    "( 9 - 18 ) shows that variational derivatives of @xmath54 and @xmath55 with respect to the metric tensor vanish in @xmath56 geometries , and , additionally , that of @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 vanish for the ricci - flat geometries .",
    "moreover , one has important simplifications of the general stress - energy tensor for the conformally coupled massive fields as there is no need to compute @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath63 finally we observe that the analogous expression of the stres - energy tensor of the quantized massive spinor and vector fields differs only by the numerical coefficients @xmath64 inserting appropriate coefficients listed in the table i into ( 7 ) , one may easily generalize our discussion to the fields of higher spins .",
    "note however , that to obtain the appropriate result for the neutral spinor field one has to multiply the renormalized effective action by the factor 1/2 .",
    "as is well known the reissner - nordstrm line element is the only static and asymptotically flat solution of the einstein- maxwell equations representing a black hole of mass @xmath65 and electric charge @xmath66 the appropriate line element has the form @xmath67 where the metric functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 are given by @xmath70 because of its simplicity the rn solution may be studied analytically ; for @xmath71 the equation @xmath72 has two positive roots @xmath73 and the larger root represents the location of the event horizon , while @xmath74 is the inner horizon . in the limit",
    "@xmath75 horizons merge at @xmath76 and the rn solution degenerates to the extremal one .",
    "the singularity of the rn line element that one encounters at @xmath77 is a non - removable curvature singularity , while those at @xmath78 are merely spurious singularities that may be easily removed by a suitable choice of coordinates .",
    "recent interest in the nonlinear electrodynamics is partially motivated , beside a natural curiosity , by the fact that the theories of this type frequently arise in modern theoretical physics .",
    "for example they appear as effective theories of string / m - theory .",
    "moreover , one expects that it should be possible to construct solutions to the coupled system of the einstein field and equations of the nonlinear electrodynamics , which may be interpreted as representing globally regular black hole geometries , avoiding thus the singularity problem . as the nonlinear electrodynamics in the weak field limit coincides with the maxwell theory , one expects that the appropriate solution should approach at large distances the rn solution .",
    "an interesting solution of this type , representing spacetime of the regular black hole with mass @xmath65 and charge @xmath13 has been constructed recently by ayn - beato and garca  @xcite .",
    "the appropriate line element is given by ( 25 ) with @xmath79.\\ ] ] for @xmath80 the abg solution reduces to the schwarzschild solution ; for small values of the charge it differs from the reisner - nordstrm solution by terms of order @xmath81 at large distances the metric structure of ( 28 ) also closely resembles that of the rn solution .",
    "indeed , expanding @xmath68 in a power series one concludes that the abg solution behaves asymptotically as @xmath82    instead of referring to numerical calculations at this stage of analyses of the abg geometry , we show that although the metric coefficient @xmath68 is a complicated function of @xmath83 , the location of the horizons may be elegantly expressed in terms of the lambert functions  @xcite .",
    "indeed , making use of the substitution @xmath84 and @xmath85 and subsequently introducing a new unknown function @xmath86 by means of the relation @xmath87 one arrives at @xmath88 since the lambert function is defined as @xmath89 one concludes that the location of the horizons as a function of @xmath90 is given by the real branches of the lambert functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 the functions @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the only real branches of the lambert function with the branch point at @xmath95 where e is the base of natural logarithms .",
    "the horizons @xmath96 and @xmath74 for @xmath97 merge at @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a principal branch of the lambert function @xmath100 numerically one has @xmath101 and @xmath102 inspection of ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) shows an interesting feature of the abg geometry : the black hole solution exists for @xmath103 greater than the analogous ratio of the parameters of the rn solution .",
    "the location of @xmath96 and @xmath74 as a function of @xmath103 for the charged black holes of both types are displayed in fig . 1 ; its numerical values for some characteristic values of @xmath104",
    "are presented in table ii .",
    "inspection of the figure shows that locations of the event horizons of the rn and abg solutions are almost indistinguishable for , approximately , @xmath105 whereas the differences between the inner horizons are more prominent .",
    "the latter differences are irrelevant here as in our analyses we shall confine ourselves to the static region exterior to the event horizon .",
    "generally , for a given @xmath106 @xmath96 of the rn black hole is always greater than @xmath96 of the abg geometry .",
    "we remark here that the global structure of the abg spacetime is similar to that of rn , with one notable distinction .",
    "simple analysis shows that the curvature invariants of the curvature tensor , @xmath107 @xmath108 and @xmath109 are regular as @xmath110 and , moreover , other differential invariants of the riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives also exhibit regularity there .",
    "one concludes therefore that the abg geometry for @xmath111 represents the regular black hole solution .",
    "while this property of the abg solution is not surprising it should be remembered that earlier efforts have been in unsuccessful in this regard .    by means of the wick rotation one",

    "one concludes that in the extremality limit the hawking temperature of the abg black hole vanishes .",
    "moreover , closer analysis indicates that for a given @xmath13 and @xmath65 the abg black hole is hotter than its rn counterpart characterized by the same values of the parameters . of course",
    ", as expected , for small electric charges both temperatures are practically indistinguishable .",

    "the method employed here is based on the observation that the first order effective action could be expressed in terms of the traced coincidence limit of the coefficient @xmath0 the general @xmath152 which has been obtained by functional differentiation of the effective action with respect to a metric tensor , has been applied in the spacetime of the nonlinear black hole . since the reissner - nordstrm line element and abg solution are practically indistinguishable from each other for small values of @xmath15 one expects that this similarity should be reflected in the behavior of the renormalized stress - energy tensor .",
    "explicit calculations confirm this hypothesis and show that important differences between appropriate tensors , @xmath153 evaluated in the spacetime of the rn black hole and that of abg occur , as expected , near the extremality limit . for small @xmath103 constructed",
    "tensors are practically indistinguishable .",
    "moreover , analyses of the hawking temperatures indicate that for a given mass and electric charge , the abg black hole is hotter than its rn black hole counterpart . since notable differences appear for temperatures close to zero one can ascribe this to the different ways of approaching the extremality limits .",
    "apart from obvious extensions of our results to the massive scalar fields with arbitrary curvature coupling and to fields of higher spins , let us mention an interesting and important direction for future work .",
    "it is a problem of the back reaction of the quantized fields upon spacetime geometry of the abg black hole , which may be studied perturbatively by means of the semiclassical einstein field equations with a source term given by the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive field and the classical stress - energy tensor of the background nonlinear electromagnetic field . to guarantee the renormalizabilty at that level",
    ", the semiclassical equations should contain higher derivative geometric terms .",
    "it is especially important in view of the recent claim that the semiclassical zero temperature rn black holes do not exists [ 14 ] .",
    "it should be stressed that the dewitt - schwinger expansion is local , and , therefore , does not describe particle creation which is a nonperturbative and nonlocal phenomenon .",
    "the method also breaks down in strong or rapidly varying gravitational fields , and , moreover , the massless limit leads to the nonphysical divergences .",
    "however , it is expected that for sufficiently massive scalar field the dewitt - schwinger approximation provides a good approximation of the exact renormalized stress - energy tensor .",
