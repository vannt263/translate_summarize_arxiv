    "of all the known transiting exoplanets , in many ways the best target for intensive study is hd  189733b , discovered by bouchy et al .",
    "the star is nearby and bright ( @xmath2  pc , @xmath3 ) ; the planet - to - star contrast is relatively large ( @xmath4 ) ; and the orbital period is relatively short ( 2.2  days ) .",
    "thus , the star grants numerous opportunities to observe deep transits with a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "investigators have seized these opportunities to measure the stellar and planetary radii ( bakos et al .",
    "2006 , winn et al .",
    "2007 , baines et al .  2007 ,",
    "pont et al .  2007 ) , the alignment between the stellar rotation and orbital axes ( winn et al .  2006 ) , the planet s infrared spectrum ( deming et al .  2007 , grillmair et al .",
    "2007 ) , the planet s infrared brightness distribution ( knutson et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the planetary atmosphere ( tinetti et al .  2007 )",
    ".    however , one aspect of hd  189733 is not ideal : the star is relatively active , with strong chromospheric emission ( wright et al .",
    "2004 ) and a spotted photosphere ( winn et al .  2007 ;",
    "pont et al .",
    "this activity effectively causes extra noise of @xmath512  m  s@xmath6 in doppler velocities and @xmath51% in relative photometry with a characteristic timescale equal to the stellar rotation period , which has been estimated by various means to be 11 - 13  days ( bouchy et al .",
    "2005 , hbrard & lecavelier des tangs 2006 , winn et al .",
    "2007 ) . because the rotation period is much longer than the transit duration ( 1.8  hr )",
    ", the activity - related noise can often be neglected in a single - transit study , or it can be accounted for with a simple prescription such as fitting a linear function of time to the out - of - transit doppler velocities or the relative flux . however , a more sophisticated understanding of the stellar variability is important for very high - precision work and for comparing observations of different transits .",
    "for example , the discrepant values for @xmath7 that have been obtained by different authors might be explained as the result of spot - pattern variability .",
    "although the photospheric variations can be a nuisance for high - precision work , they do provide at least one benefit , namely , the possibility of measuring the stellar rotation period with great accuracy .",
    "if the spot pattern is relatively stable over several rotation cycles , then a quasiperiodicity may be detectable in the stellar flux .",
    "the rotation period is a fundamental quantity characterizing the star as well as the angular momentum evolution of the planetary system , and the period can also be used to study the alignment between the stellar rotation axis and the orbital axis ( winn et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "in this paper we present optical photometry of hd  189733 spanning three observing seasons , from 2005 october to 2007 july .",
    "our goal is to provide a fuller context for some of the specific datasets that were taken during this timespan , and to help in planning future investigations by setting realistic expectations for the typical variability of this star . in the following section ,",
    "we describe the observations and the data and provide the entire data set in electronic form . in   3 , we use the data to determine the stellar rotation period with much greater precision than has previously been possible . [ a portion of the data was presented by winn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , but the expanded dataset presented here allows for tremendous improvement . ] in   4 , we use the improved stellar rotation period to update the determination of the inclination angle of the stellar rotation axis with respect to the sky plane .",
    "the last section summarizes the results .",
    "we acquired 314 good observations of hd  189733 between 2005 october and 2007 july with the t10 0.8 m automated photometric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory in southern arizona .",
    "the apt uses two temperature - stabilized emi 9124qb photomultiplier tubes to detect photon count rates simultaneously through strmgren @xmath8 and @xmath9 filters . on a given night",
    ", the telescope automatically makes observations of each target star and three nearby comparison stars , along with measures of the dark count rate and sky brightness in the vicinity of each star . designating the comparison stars as a , b , and c , and the target star as d",
    ", the observing sequence is dark , a , b , c , d , a , sky@xmath10 , b , sky@xmath11 , c , sky@xmath12 , d , sky@xmath13 , a , b , c , d. in this case , the target star d was hd  189733 , and the comparison stars a , b , and c were hd  189410 , hd  191260 , and hd  189410 , respectively ( i.e. , we chose to make duplicate observations of hd  189410 rather than use a third comparison star ) .",
    "a diaphragm size of @xmath14 and an integration time of 20 seconds were used for all integrations .",
    "the observations were reduced to form 3 independent measures of each of the 6 differential magnitudes d@xmath15a , d@xmath15b , d@xmath15c , c@xmath15a , c@xmath15b , and b@xmath15a .",
    "these were placed on the standard strmgren system with yearly mean transformation coefficients .",
    "these differential magnitudes were corrected for dead time and differential extinction . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "the data from the @xmath8 and @xmath9 passbands were averaged to create `` @xmath16 '' magnitudes . after passing quality control tests ,",
    "the 3 independent measures of each differential magnitude were combined , giving one mean data point per complete sequence for each of the 6 differential magnitudes .",
    "the standard deviations of a single observation about the means of the 314 d@xmath15a , d@xmath15b , d@xmath15c , c@xmath15a , c@xmath15b , and b@xmath15a differentials are 0.0064 , 0.0064 , 0.0064 , 0.0014 , 0.0019 , and 0.0018 , respectively . because c and a represent the same star , the c@xmath15a standard deviation of 0.0014  mag is a good estimate of the limiting uncertainty in each measurement .",
    "the c@xmath15b and b@xmath15a standard deviations of 0.0019 and 0.0018  mag show that the two comparison stars ( a and b ) are intrinsically constant to 0.001  mag or better . the much larger standard deviations ( 0.0064  mag ) of the d@xmath15a , d@xmath15b , and d@xmath15c data indicate that hd  189733 is significantly variable . for additional information on the telescopes , photometers , observing procedures , data reduction techniques , and photometric precision ,",
    "see henry  ( 1999 ) or eaton , henry , & fekel ( 2003 ) .",
    "the individual @xmath16 observations for all 6 combinations of differential magnitudes are given in table  1 .",
    "the time variation of the d@xmath15a observations is evident in the top panel of figure  1 .",
    "the time series can be divided into 4 segments of nearly nightly coverage interrupted by long gaps .",
    "the first segment is the latter half of the 2005 observing season .",
    "the second and third segments are from the 2006 observing season , which is interrupted by the summer shutdown of the apts during arizona s rainy season .",
    "the fourth segment is from the first half of the 2007 observing season up until the 2007 summer shutdown .",
    "it is clear from figure  1 that hd  189733 was variable throughout our entire photometric campaign .",
    "as noted above , the standard deviation of the complete d@xmath15a data set is 0.0064 mag .",
    "the standard deviations of the 4 contiguous time ranges shown in the lower 4 panels of fig",
    ".  1 are ( from top to bottom ) 0.0058 , 0.0044 , 0.0083 , and 0.0053 mag . from the beginning until approximately jd",
    "2,453,880 ( late in may of 2006 and marked with an arrow in fig .  1 ) , the variability was rather erratic .",
    "however , from that time forward , the star has exhibited coherent oscillations until the end of our observations .",
    "chromospherically active stars are often observed to exhibit erratic and occasionally quasiperiodic photometric variability ( see , e.g. , vaughan et al .  1981 ; henry , fekel , & hall 1995 ; lockwood et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the quasiperiodic component of the variability is interpreted as the result of photospheric spots and plages that are carried into and out of view as the star rotates ( wilson 1978 ) .",
    "the coherence of the oscillations is limited by time variations of the spot pattern on the rotational timescale , as well as emission variations on shorter timescales . adopting the same interpretation for hd  189733 ,",
    "the spots cover @xmath171%2% of the stellar surface at any moment .",
    "their distribution is apparently complex but was reasonably stable between 2006 may and 2007 july , the time period during which coherent oscillations were observed ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this allows us to estimate the rotation period of hd  189733 with greater precision than previous estimates .",
    "the top panel of fig .  2 shows the frequency power spectrum of the d@xmath15a data from jd  2,453,880 onward , computed with the method of vanek  ( 1971 ) . there is a strong peak corresponding to a period of 11.952  days with an estimated uncertainty of 0.016  days .",
    "similar analyses of the d@xmath15b and d@xmath15c data ( the differential magnitudes derived from different comparison observations ) gave @xmath18  days and @xmath19  days , respectively .",
    "these three estimates are all in good agreement .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the mean of these three period determinations give @xmath20 days , but this precision is probably too optimistic since the three period determinations are not completely independent .",
    "therefore , as our best estimate of the rotation period , we adopt the weighted mean of the three determinations and its formal uncertainty : @xmath21  days .",
    "the phase - folded light curve is shown in the bottom panel of fig .  2 .",
    "the quasi - sinusoidal pattern is typical of spot - induced variability with modest cycle - to - cycle spot variations ( henry , fekel , & hall 1995 ) .    how does this compare to previous estimates of the rotation period ?",
    "bouchy et al .",
    "( 2005 ) estimated @xmath22  days ( but did not venture an uncertainty ) , based on the combination of the estimated stellar radius , the measurement of the stellar projected rotation velocity @xmath23 , and the assumption @xmath24 .",
    "hbrard & lecavelier des tangs  ( 2006 ) analyzed the _",
    "photometry for this star and found candidate periods at 13.3 , 11.8 , 8.8 , and 4.6  days .",
    "they identified the 11.8-day period as the likely rotation period but did not quantify the uncertainty , as their main concern was identifying planetary transits and refining the estimate of the _ orbital _ period .",
    "a portion of our data were published previously ( winn et al .",
    "2007 ) , yielding the estimate @xmath25  days , but that estimate was based on the observation of only 2.5 cycles over approximately 40 days .",
    "this is why we cautioned that continued monitoring was needed to check on the period estimate .",
    "in contrast , during the full campaign presented in this paper , we observed 18 complete cycles over approximately 400 days .",
    "as alluded to earlier , the measured rotation period can be used to estimate the inclination of the stellar rotation axis with respect to the sky plane .",
    "since the planetary orbit is nearly edge - on , it is natural to suppose the stellar equator is also viewed nearly edge - on , and it is interesting to test this hypothesis . even if planet formation usually results in the alignment of planetary orbital axes and stellar rotation axis ",
    "an assumption that itself is worth checking  some of the planetary `` migration '' mechanisms that have been proposed to explain close - in giant planets such as hd  189733 could produce large misalignments . in particular , a broad distribution of spin - orbit angles is predicted by theories involving planet - planet scattering ( chatterjee et al .",
    "2007 ) and kozai cycles with tidal friction ( fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ) .",
    "there are at least two observable aspects of spin - orbit alignment .",
    "the first aspect is the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , a spectroscopic distortion that occurs during transits .",
    "observations of this `` spectroscopic transit '' can be used to estimate the angle @xmath26 between the _ sky projections _ of the stellar rotation axis and the orbital axis ( ohta et al .",
    "2005 , gaudi & winn 2007 ) .",
    "for this system , @xmath26 has been measured to be @xmath27 ( winn et al .",
    "the second aspect is the inclination @xmath28 of the stellar rotation axis with respect to the sky plane , which can be written in terms of measurable quantities as follows : @xmath29 this calculation was done by winn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) using the data available at that time .",
    "we update the result using the new value @xmath30  days as well as the more precise value @xmath31 that has become available through space - based photometry ( pont et al .",
    "the most precise measurement of @xmath32 remains unchanged , @xmath33  km  s@xmath6 ( winn et al .",
    "assuming gaussian errors in all these quantities , the result is @xmath34 .",
    "we estimated the _ a posteriori _ probability distribution @xmath35 as follows .",
    "for each trial value of @xmath28 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , we computed @xmath38 and made the usual maximum - likelihood assumption @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting probability distribution and the corresponding cumulative distribution are shown in fig .",
    "although the most probable value of @xmath28 is @xmath40 , more edge - on configurations are not strongly disfavored , and hence the results are best interpreted as a lower limit on the inclination angle : @xmath41 with 95% confidence .",
    "this lower bound is hardly changed at all from the previous result of winn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and is indeed slightly _ less _ stringent .",
    "the limiting factor is the uncertainty in @xmath23 , and it is not obvious how further improvement can be made , since the uncertainty is dominated by calibration error rather than random error .",
    "we have presented optical photometry spanning 3 observing seasons for hd  189733 , one of the very brightest stars that has a known transiting planet . during the latter half of our campaign",
    ", we detected periodic photometric variations that allowed us to refine the estimated stellar rotation period by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "our photometric data will allow the numerous investigators who carried out intensive transit observations between 2005 and 2007 to assess any spot - induced effects on their data and will help to set realistic expectations for future programs .",
    "we confirm the previously published result that the stellar rotation axis is not strongly misaligned with the orbital axis .",
    "given that the intense interest in this object does not seem to be subsiding , we plan to continue the apt observations over the next few seasons .",
