    "rencently , static classical configurations that are exact solution of the equation of motion in scalar potential model have drawn much attention mainly because they have found interesting applications as a solitary wave @xcite .",
    "there are several methods to build up soliton ( kink ) solutions associated with some nonlinear differential equations @xcite .",
    "the kink of a scalar field theory is a static , non - singular , _ classically stable _ and finite - localized energy solution of the equation of motion @xcite .",
    "when @xmath0 a kink solution is called solitary wave . the role of classical solutions in quantum field theories",
    "have recently been overviewed @xcite .",
    "there , one can see how a quantum field theory has topological and non - topological soliton solutions in higher spatial dimensions . in the literature",
    ", there is a surprising number of scalar potential models in higher spatial dimensions with exactly solvable equations of motion .",
    "also , a variety of classical finite - energy static solutions are known .",
    "the connection between supersymmetry in quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) @xcite and the topological and non - topological solitons in terms of a scalar potential ( for the case of a single field ) has been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the connection between susy qm associated with two - component eigenfunctions @xcite and the topological solitons in terms of two coupled scalar fields have already been considered in @xcite .",
    "recently , the reconstruction of 2-dimensional scalar field potential models has been considered starting from the morse and the scarf ii hyperbolic potential , and quantum corrections to the solitonic sectors of both potentials are pointed out @xcite .    in the present work , from a non - polynomial potential in supersymmetric quantum mechanics",
    ", we shall propose new potentials as functions of one single real scalar field . indeed , in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , non - polynomial interactions are not really harmful , from the point of view of renormalisation .",
    "actually , non - linear @xmath1models are the most representative class of renormalisable models in 2d , and their interactions are described by non - polynomial functions .",
    "we consider the interesting program of proposing new potential models in 1 + 1 dimensions , whose essential point is associated with the translational invariance of the static field configuration @xcite . here , the aim is to find field potential models via susy qm considering a one - dimensional quantum mechanical isospectral potential class such that the corresponding fluctuation operator sets a schrdinger - like eigenvalue problem as a stability equation exactly solvable for the @xmath2model .",
    "however , the corresponding field potential can not be put in a closed form .",
    "indeed , we show that in such a procedure there appears a new non - polynomial field potential model with infinite - energy static configuration , so that such a new potential may not be considered as a well - defined theoretical field potential model .",
    "actually , we shall bring two constructions of classical solutions .",
    "in the first case , we obtain the well - known topological kink , whereas in the second case we obtain a non - topological static configuration which is not a kink . in the second case",
    "the new static field configuration is not a smooth function over all the the spatial - time .",
    "we also propose some pictures of the field potential models ( figures i and iii ) and the static classical field configurations ( figures ii and iv ) .",
    "consider the lagrangian density for a single scalar field , @xmath3 in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions , in natural system @xmath4 , given by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is any positive semi - definite function of @xmath7 , which must have at least two zeros for kinks to exist .",
    "it represents a well - behaved potential energy .",
    "however , as it will be shown below , we have found a new potential which is exactly solvable exactly in the context of the classical theory in ( 1 + 1)-d that not a kink .    the field equation for a static classical configuration , @xmath8 becomes    @xmath9    with the following boundary conditions : @xmath10 as @xmath11",
    "since the potential is positive , it can be written as    @xmath12    giving the well - known bogomolnyi condition ,    @xmath13    where the solutions with the plus and minus signs represent two configurations .",
    "the classical stability of the static solution is investigated by considering small perturbations around it ,    @xmath14    where we expand the fluctuations in terms of the normal modes , @xmath15 the @xmath16s are so chosen that @xmath17 are real .",
    "a localised classical configuration is said to be dynamically stable if the fluctuation does not destroy it .",
    "the equation of motion becomes a schrdinger - like equation , viz .",
    ",    @xmath18    according to ( [ e4 ] ) , one obtains the supersymmetric form , @xcite    @xmath19    where the primes stand for a second derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "if the normal modes of ( [ e13 ] ) satisfy @xmath20 the stability of the schrdinger - like equation is ensured .",
    "now , we are able to implement a method that provides a new potential from the potential term that appears in the fluctuation operator .",
    "next , we consider the following generalized isospectral potential as being the potential term ( [ e14 ] ) for the fluctuation operator :    @xmath21\\nonumber\\\\ { } & + & 2m^2\\beta \\left[sech^4\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt 2}x \\right ) \\left(2tanh\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt 2}x \\right)+ \\frac{\\beta}{2}sech^4\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt 2}x\\right ) \\chi \\right)\\chi\\right],\\nonumber\\\\ \\chi & = & \\chi ( x;\\alpha,\\beta)=\\left\\{\\alpha+ \\beta\\left[tanh\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt 2}x \\right )",
    "- \\frac 13tanh^{3}\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt 2}x\\right)\\right]\\right\\}^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constant parameters .",
    "this non - polynomial potential satisfies the condition @xmath24 and the ground state associated to the zero mode ( @xmath25 ) is given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the normalization constant .",
    "note that , if @xmath28 the eigenfunction of the ground state is non - singular .",
    "this ground state was independently found by two authors @xcite for @xmath29    it is well - known that the bosonic zero - mode eigenfunction of the stability equation is related with the kink by    @xmath30    so that , a priori , we may find the static classical configuration by a first integration .",
    "therefore , the potential    @xmath31    yields a class of scalar potentials , @xmath32 which have exact solutions .",
    "there , we can find various static field configurations ; however , let us consider here only two cases .    case ( i ) : @xmath33 and @xmath34    in this case ,",
    "@xmath35 so that from ( [ np ] ) and ( [ gs ] ) , we obtain the following bosonic zero - mode solution :    @xmath36    and the non - polynomial potential becomes    @xmath37.\\ ] ]    notice that the two schrdinger - like fluctuation operators associated with both @xmath38 and @xmath39 non - polynomial potentials are positive semi - definite and completly isospectrals .",
    "however , their factorization has been implemented from distinct superpotentials . indeed , while the ricatti equation ,    @xmath40    where @xmath41 has a particular solution given by @xmath42 provides    @xmath43    with @xmath44 given by eq .",
    "( [ mzpd ] ) , the ricatti equation @xmath45 has a particular solution given by @xmath46    by substituting eq .",
    "( [ mzpd ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) , we get the well - known kink of the double - well potential ,    @xmath47    when we express the position coordinate in terms of the kink , i.e. @xmath48 we find the @xmath2potential model with spontaneously broken symmetry in scalar field theory , viz . ,    @xmath49    the mass of the kink is finite , but , in the next case , we obtain an undefined kink mass .",
    "such a classical configuration can not represents a stable particle .",
    "the pictures of the potential ( [ pd ] ) and of the kink ( [ k ] ) are in figures i and ii .",
    "note that both are smooth functions of the field and the spatial coordinate , respectively .",
    "case ( ii ) : @xmath50    in this case , from ( [ np ] ) , ( [ gs ] ) and ( [ mz ] ) , we obtain the following non - polynomial potential in the singularity region associated to the ground state given by eq . (",
    "10 ) :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "the vacuum state , @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 this non - polynomial potential does not have the discrete symmetry , @xmath56 and there exists only one vacuum state , so that it is non - topological .    from ( [ e4 ] ) , ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e21 ] ) , for the minus sign of the bogomolnyi condition and the coupling constant @xmath57 , the static classical configuration has the following explicit form    @xmath58    where the integration constant is taken to be zero .",
    "note that this static configuration satisfies eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) and the following boundary conditions @xmath59 as @xmath60 the pictures of the non - polynomial potential and the static solution are in figs .",
    "ii and iv . however , in fig .",
    "iv , we have plotted this static field configuration only for the region in that it has a singularity in the origin .",
    "the energy density for the static solution for the non - polynomial potential is given by    @xmath61    which yields an undefined total energy or classical mass .",
    "here , we have used the explicit relations between the static configuration and one - dimensional spatial coordinate .",
    "in this section , we consider the fluctuation operator in the context of supersymmetry in quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) , where the supersymmetric partners are build up from the stability equation . in @xmath62susy , we define the following first order differential operators :    @xmath63    the fluctuation operator for the bosonic sector is given by    @xmath64    so that in terms of the superpotential we obtain the following nonlinear first order differential equation @xmath65 where the prime means a derivative with respect to @xmath66    the superpotential that solve this riccati equation for the non - polynomial potential has the following explicit form :    @xmath67}\\ ] ]    note that this particular solution to the riccati differential equation has the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath68 as @xmath69 and @xmath70 as @xmath71 the supersymmetric partner of @xmath72 is given by    @xmath73    these fluctuation operators are isospectral and consist of a pair schrdinger - like hamiltonians of witten s model of broken susy @xcite .",
    "note that the shape invariance condition @xcite is not satisfied for @xmath74 given by eqs .",
    "( [ e27 ] ) and ( [ e28 ] ) , i.e. @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are constants .",
    "the eigenvalue equations for the supersymmetric partners @xmath78 are given by    @xmath79    for which , in general , @xmath72 may have as eigenstates the well - known normal modes .",
    "however , when @xmath80 the bosonic zero - mode @xmath81 satisfies the annihilation condition    @xmath82    this eigensolution is not normalizable , so that the fluctuation operator for the bosonic sector does not have a zero - mode . in this case",
    ", the integral @xmath83 is undefined .",
    "this result is in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) , for @xmath84 furthermore , bosonic zero mode satisfies @xmath85 the fermionic sector fluctuation operator @xmath86 does not have zero - modes because @xmath87    @xmath88\\ ] ]    because it is not normalizable . in this case",
    "we have broken susy .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that @xmath89 the eigenvalues @xmath90 and eigenfunctions @xmath91 can be exactly solved in a similar way for a general potential .",
    "all eigenvalues of @xmath86 are eigenvalues of @xmath92 i.e. @xmath93 so that the ground state and the excited state of both @xmath94 have energy different from zero .",
    "in this work , we investigate the classical stability of a new isospectral non - polynomial potential model with static classical configuration which solve exactly the equation of motion .",
    "indeed , the classical finite - energy static solutions appear in field theoretical models with spontaneously broken symmetry ( susy ) , for example , in the double - well potential given by eq .",
    "( [ pd ] ) .",
    "it is well - known that the double - well potential model which has two zeros corresponding to the vacuum states @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in this case , the topological kink interpolates smoothly and monotonically between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , according to figs .",
    "but , in our non - polynomial scalar potential one builds a static , infinite - energy and classically singular field configuration , which is in a non - topological sector .",
    "indeed , we have found a new potential model given by eq .",
    "( [ e21 ] ) that is solved exactly in the context of classical theory in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions .    in conclusion",
    ", we found @xmath97 and @xmath98 is a supersymmetric potential pair with unbroken susy , so that @xmath99 refers to the bosonic sector of the susy fluctuation operator @xmath100 while @xmath101 is the fermionic sector of @xmath102 . in this case",
    ", @xmath103 then becomes the unique normalizable eigenfunction of the @xmath102 corresponding to the zero mode of the ground state .",
    "on the other hand , the spectra to @xmath94 are identical and in this case , there are no zero mode for the ground state i.e. @xmath104 thus one has broken susy",
    ".    therefore , our non - polynomial potential does not have the reflection symmetry @xmath105 with a stability equation so that it does not lead to either a bosonic zero mode or its supersymmetric partner because both eigenfunctions are non - normalizable with susy broken .",
    "thus , the scheme above for proposing new field potential models is not always physically acceptable , because it may lead to infinite energy configuration .",
