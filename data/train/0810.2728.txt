    "small quantum systems , whose properties are profoundly affected by environment , i.e. , continuum of scattering and decay channels , are intensely studied in various fields of physics ( nuclear physics , atomic and molecular physics , nanoscience , quantum optics , etc . ) . these different open quantum systems ( oqs ) , in spite of their specific features , have generic properties , which are common to all weakly bound / unbound systems close to the threshold . while many of these phenomena have been originally studied in nuclear reactions , it is not possible to experimentally control the behavior of the nucleus by varying external parameters as in , e.g. , atoms and molecules , quantum dots , or microwave resonators .",
    "nuclear physics contains the core of sub - atomic science with the main focus on self - organization and stability of nucleonic matter .",
    "nuclei themselves are prototypical mesoscopic oqss and splendid laboratories of many - body physics . while the number of degrees of freedom in heavy nuclei is large , it is still very small compared to the number of electrons in a solid or atoms in a mole of gas .",
    "nevertheless , nuclei exhibit behaviors that are emergent in nature and present in other complex systems .",
    "since nuclear properties are profoundly affected by environment , i.e. , the many - body continuum representing scattering and decay channels , a simultaneous understanding of the structural and reaction aspects is at the very heart of understanding short - lived nucleonic matter .",

    "weakly bound nuclei , such as halos , inhabit a drip - line region characterized by very small values of @xmath0 . the unbound nuclei beyond the one - neutron drip line are resonances .",

    "resonances are genuine intrinsic properties of quantum systems , associated with their natural frequencies , and describing preferential decays of unbound states . the effect of resonances and the non - resonant scattering states can be considered in the oqs extension of the shell model ( sm ) , the so - called continuum shell model ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "a particular realization of the csm is the complex - energy csm based on the berggren ensemble , the gamow shell model ( gsm ) .",
    "the standard quantum mechanics ( the hilbert space formulation ) does not allow the description of state vectors with exponential growth and exponential decay , such as resonance states .",
    "since the spectrum of an observable is real in the hilbert space , the usual procedure for treating unbound resonance states is either to extract the trace of resonances from the real - energy continuum level density or to describe the resonances by joining the _ bound _ state solution in the interior region with an asymptotic solution , e.g. , within the r - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "these difficulties of the hilbert space formulation have been resolved in the rigged hilbert space ( rhs ) @xcite formulation .",
    "thus , in a broader sense , the mathematical setting of gsm follows directly from the formulation of quantum mechanics in the rhs ( gelfand triple ) @xcite rather than the usual hilbert space ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the gelfand triple framework allows not only to formulate rigorously dirac s formalism of ` bras ' and ` kets ' @xcite but also encompasses new concepts , like gamow states , and is suitable for extending the domain of quantum mechanics into the time - asymmetric processes like decays , offering a unified treatment of bound , resonance , and scattering states .    in the past",

    "realistic studies within the real - energy csm have been presented recently in the framework of the shell model embedded in the continuum ( smec ) @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological csm with an approximate treatment of continuum couplings has been proposed in ref .",
    "these models have the advantage of being able to provide reaction observables such as radiative capture and elastic / inelastic cross sections @xcite .",
    "however , they rely on a somehow artificial separation of the hilbert space into bound / resonant and non - resonant scattering parts .",
    "this is contrary to gsm , in which all states are treated on the same footing .",
    "the use of projected subspaces in smec ( csm ) complicates matters significantly when several particles in the non - resonant scattering continuum are considered .",
    "it is only recently that smec has been extended to treat the two - particle continuum @xcite in the context of two - proton radioactivity @xcite . while numerically demanding , these first applications were still subject to several approximations , such as sequential or two - body cluster decays .",

    "asymptotically , the radial wave function of a virtual state grows exponentially : @xmath25 as often discussed in the literature , it is difficult to provide a physical interpretation to virtual states . in the hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics ,",

    "the @xmath41 bound state is closer to the origin than the corresponding antibound pole .",

    "( [ squarewell ] ) but with the im(@xmath12)-axis shifted down by about @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "this shift would change the relative distance of the antibound and bound states with respect to the origin , with one antibound pole to appear between the loosest bound state and the threshold @xcite .      in the original formulation of the completeness relation ( [ berggren_comp_rel ] ) , only decaying poles with @xmath44 were considered .",
    "consequently , virtual resonances ( resonant poles with @xmath45 ) and antibound states were excluded from the berggren ensemble .",
    "the berggren representation has been generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite by including a virtual state into the discrete part of the basis .",
    "the generalization requires a slight deformation of @xmath18 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ lu_contour ] .",
    "more recently , this generalized berggren representation was used in a full form ( i.e. , including the scattering component ) for the description of drip - line nuclei @xmath46li and @xmath47ca @xcite . a large destructive interference between the virtual state and the scattering contour states has been observed . in this picture , the bound ground state of @xmath46li could be explained in terms of unbound states of @xmath48li .",
    "soon afterwards it was noted @xcite that a generalized berggren basis is not optimal as far as the number of basis states is concerned .",
    "indeed , as the halo wave function has a decaying character at large distances due to the exponentially increasing asymptotics of the virtual state ( [ virt ] ) , its inclusion in the basis always induces strong negative interference with the scattering states .",
    "therefore , adding antibound states to the basis is not beneficial in gsm applications , as more discretized scattering states are necessary to reach a required precision .      the completeness relation by berggren ( [ berggren_comp_rel ] )",
    "can be derived from the newton completeness relation for the set of real - energy eigenstates of a short - range potential @xcite : @xmath49 the proof can be carried out by deforming the real momentum axis associated with positive - energy scattering states into the @xmath18 contour of fig .  [ lu_contour ] and applying the cauchy integral theorem @xcite .",
    "this is possible because resonant states appear as residues , due to their @xmath19-matrix pole character .",
    "bound and real - energy scattering states generated by a potential bearing a coulomb tail naturally form a complete set as well , as all self - adjoint operators possess a spectral decomposition @xcite .",
    "however , methods used in ref .",
    "@xcite , relying on the lebesgue measure theory , are very general and fairly abstract .",
    "thus , a simple demonstration of the completeness relation for potentials with a pure coulomb asymptotic behavior is called for .",
    "the proof of ( [ newt ] ) relies on the analyticity of the green s function of a local potential that is integrable for @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "potentials having a coulomb tail , proportional to @xmath51 , have not been considered in ref .",
    "non - locality often appears in practical applications @xcite , so it is important to demonstrate the completeness relation for non - local potentials having a coulomb asymptotic behavior .",
    "this has been done recently in refs .",
    "@xcite , where detailed derivations can be found .    in short , the main assumption behind the proof presented in refs .",
    "@xcite is that beyond a finite radius @xmath52 the potential behaves as @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding radial schrdinger equation reads : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are respectively the local and non - local potentials . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the wave function is a linear combination of regular and irregular coulomb functions . their analytical character and the fact that regular coulomb wave functions form a complete set @xcite are important to the demonstration of the completeness .",
    "using analytic continuation arguments , one can also demonstrate that the set of bound and real - energy scattering states generated by complex potentials @xmath54 and @xmath55 is complete , provided no exceptional points , i.e. , bound states of norm zero @xcite , are present .",
    "heuristic methods often precede a complete formulation of the physical theory in terms of an adequate mathematical apparatus .",
    "this was the case for dirac s formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite which a posteriori found a satisfactory setting in the rhs @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for theoretical developments utilizing gamow states to describe weakly bound and/or unbound states of quantum systems .",
    "the berggren completeness relation @xcite , which replaces the real - energy scattering states by the resonance contribution and a background of complex - energy continuum states , puts the resonance part of the spectrum on the same footing as the bound and scattering spectrum .",
    "however , resonances do not belong to the usual hilbert space , so the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics in hilbert space is inappropriate and can not encompass concepts such as gamow states .",
    "quite unexpectedly , it turned out that the mathematical structure of the rhs is ready to extend the domain of quantum mechanics into the time - asymmetric processes such as decays .",
    "the rhs , or gelfand triple , is a triad of spaces @xcite : @xmath57 which represent different completions of the same infinitely dimensional linear space @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 ( the subspace of test functions ) is a dense subspace of hilbert space @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ( the space of distributions ) is the space of antilinear functionals over @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath59 is also the largest subspace of @xmath60 on which expectation values , uncertainties and commutation relations can be correctly defined for unbounded operators .",
    "the linear functionals over @xmath59 are contained in the space @xmath62 which is related to another rhs : @xmath63 one should stress that @xmath60 in ( [ rhs1 ] ) and ( [ rhs2 ] ) does not have any particular significance in the rhs formalism . for all physics problems , one needs only the dual pair of spaces @xmath64 which characterize the considered quantum system .",
    "for example , bras and kets , which are related to the continuous part of the spectrum of an observable , belong to @xmath62 and @xmath61 , respectively , and not to @xmath60 .",
    "apparently , the rhs provides also a more convenient framework than @xmath60 to capture physical principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "the heisenberg s uncertainty relations are properly defined on @xmath59 , and not on @xmath60 .",
    "besides implementation of dirac s formalism of bras and kets , the rhs provides a framework for a quantum mechanical description of common irreversible processes , like the formation or decay of quantum states .",
    "indeed , @xmath61 may contain generalized eigenvectors of the observable(s ) with complex eigenvalues .",
    "the generalized eigenvectors of the hermitian hamiltonian are gamow vectors .",
    "examples of the rhs for the observables having a continuous part in the spectrum can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "gamow vectors are state vectors of resonances .",
    "they belong to rhs and not to @xmath60 since the self - adjoint operators in @xmath60 can only have real eigenvalues .",
    "like the plane waves ( the dirac kets ) , the gamow functions are not square integrable and must be treated as distributions . in this way , one succeeds to generate gamow bras and kets which fit naturally in the rhs .",
    "however , unlike the dirac kets , the probability density for gamow functions is not constant but increases exponentially in space .",
    "rules for the normalization of gamow functions and corresponding completeness relations have been proposed @xcite independently of the rhs formulation .",
    "similarly , the momentum space representation for gamow functions has been introduced @xcite .",
    "rhs offers a mathematical framework to formulate those results rigorously .",
    "in particular , the rhs provides a unifying dual description of bound , resonant and scattering states both in terms of the @xmath19-matrix and in terms of the vector in the rhs .",
    "the transition amplitude @xmath65 from a resonance of energy @xmath66 to a scattering state at an energy @xmath67 ( @xmath68)@xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the normalization factor , is proportional to the complex @xmath71-function @xcite which , far off the threshold energy in the region of the resonance , can be approximated by the breit - wigner amplitude .",
    "this physically expected result provides a formal link between gamow states and nearly - lorentzian peaks in cross - sections for narrow , isolated resonances .",
    "interpretation of certain aspects of the rhs formulation of quantum mechanics is still debated , and connections between berggren and rhs formulations continue to be studied ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "one aspect of this discussion concerns complex matrix elements of the operators and probabilistic interpretation of the resonant wave function . as an illustration of this problem for resonances ,",

    "this feature guarantees , in fact , the particle - number conservation @xcite : the exponential temporal decrease of the wave function amplitude is complemented by its exponential spatial increase , and the divergence of the resonance wave function assures that the particle number is conserved .",
    "in general , the quasi - stationary description of a time - dependent physical process works well when the decaying state is narrow , as in this case the formation of a state and its subsequent decay can be well separated in time .",
    "a narrow gamow resonance has a large overlap with a properly shaped wave packet @xcite and its radial wave function is similar to a bound state wave function while the imaginary part is small inside the nucleus . in the reaction cross section ,",
    "such a narrow resonance shows up as a sharp peak which can be well separated from the non - resonant background .",
    "another aspect of the debate on the physical interpretation of gamow vectors concerns the expectation value of an operator in a resonant state .",
    "berggren s interpretation of real and imaginary parts of the expectation value of an operator is based on the discussion of interference effects in the reaction cross - sections @xcite .",
    "berggren showed that the imaginary part of the complex cross section calculated with the gamow resonance as a final state describes the interference of that resonance with the non - resonant background . in a later paper @xcite",
    ", berggren demonstrated that for any operator which commutes with the hamiltonian , the expectation value of that operator is the real part of its matrix element , and the negative of the square of the imaginary part of the matrix element can be associated with the square of an uncertainty of the expectation value .",
    "this proof holds only for operators which commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "it turns out that the berggren interpretation of the expectation value @xcite is largely equivalent to the rhs formulation by bohm and gadella @xcite and coincides with it in the leading order @xcite .",

    "it was found that the radial expectation value in this model can be interpreted according to berggren s prescription and that it can be used to characterize the resonances as long as the wavelength of the decaying wave is shorter than the radial extension of the resonant state .      already in 1970 , in the pioneering work employing resonant states , a truncated resonant basis composed of bound neutron and resonant proton states was used to describe isobaric analog resonances @xcite .",

    "they used the normalization of the pole solutions introduced in  @xcite and later employed in , e.g. , refs .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that the pole expansion could be used in ( shell - model - type ) nuclear structure calculations ; however , they worried about the non - orthogonality of the basis . in a numerical study  @xcite , the usefulness of the ml - type pole expansion of the green s function",
    "was examined .",

    "the positions of the poles were calculated by using the uniform complex scaling ( see sec .  [ complexsc ] ) , while the residues were obtained by using numerical methods described in refs .",
    "neutron emission from a heavy - ion reaction was modeled in a time - dependent two - center shell model in ref .",
    "therein , resonant states were calculated in the momentum space using the potential separable expansion ( pse ) method @xcite , in which the potential is expanded in a square integrable ( harmonic oscillator ; ho ) basis , and the proper asymptotic of the wave function is guaranteed by the presence of the free green s function .",
    "a less severe truncation of the berggren basis was employed in the late 1980s in the resonant approach to the random phase approximation ( rrpa ) , in which the contribution from the non - resonant continuum was neglected @xcite .",
    "such an expansion is usually referred to as a _ pole approximation_. ( a detailed summary of the early theoretical approaches employing resonant states can be found in ref .  @xcite . ) a similar pole approximation was used in the rrpa description of giant resonance escape widths @xcite .",
    "a careful test of different pole expansions was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite by using a benchmark continuum rpa result for the particle - hole response function ( see sec .",
    "[ crpa ] for details ) .",
    "it was found that the ml - type pole expansion was closer to the continuum rpa , based on the green s function , than the pole approximation .",

    "unfortunately , an expansion using the @xmath22 contour , @xmath92 can not be used in shell - model - like calculations because the factor @xmath93 in the front of the sum over the resonant ( bound , antibound , capturing , and decaying ) states destroys the idempotency of the unity operator @xcite .",
    "in addition , pole expansions of type ( [ mitexp ] ) are accurate only if very many poles ( up to some large energy cut - off ) are included in the sum ; contributions from broad and virtual resonances ( having negative real energies ) are in fact essential @xcite .    in ref .",

    ". while configurations involving the @xmath120 resonant state are similar , those associated with the @xmath121 broad resonant state are very different .",
    "this is due to the large coupling to the non - resonant continuum present in the @xmath122 partial wave with a weak contribution of the @xmath121 pole .",
    "while gsm is limited to @xmath123 and @xmath122 partial waves , cosm includes all partial waves up to @xmath26=5 , so that additional couplings change the relative occupancy of resonant and non - resonant @xmath122 shells .",
    "this is nicely illustrated in a variant of cosm calculations in which a renormalized interaction was employed in a truncated space of partial waves with @xmath26=1 . as seen in table",
    "[ gsm_cosm_comparison ] , gsm and cosm occupations are fairly close in this case @xcite .",
    "one should stress , however , that the sum of components of the ground - state wave function of @xmath119he over resonant state and non - resonant continuum states for @xmath123 and @xmath122 partial waves is practically the same in both gsm and cosm .",
    "these quantities give the basis independent estimate of configuration mixing in the ground - state of @xmath119he as given by gsm and cosm hamiltonians , respectively .",
    "hence , one can conclude that taking more partial waves does not change quantitatively the prediction about a structure of the ground - state wave function of @xmath119he @xcite .    in many aspects , gsm and cosm are complementary .",
    "the use of complex - scaled hamiltonian allows to calculate resonant states in cosm in a basis of discrete bound states . exact asymptotic behavior , which is efficiently treated by means of hyperspherical coordinates , has to be ensured . in practice , however , this requirement is impossible to fulfill with more than three clusters .",

    "the nucleonic shell structure is characterized by the appearance of large energy gaps in the s.p .  spectrum . in open shell nuclei",

    "potential ( that generates shell structure with immutable magic numbers ) and a two - body residual interaction @xcite . as a result of configuration mixing , new magic numbers in neutron - rich nuclei appear far from stability , while some traditional ones disappear .",
    "another systematic effect of large neutron excess , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ oqs ] , is a decrease of one - neutron separation energy when moving towards the neutron drip line .",
    "gsm is the oqs formulation of sm for a _ self - adjoint _ hamilton operator .",
    "this choice offers a number of conceptual advantages .",
    "for instance , the transition from a bound to unbound regime , either within a single nucleus or in the long chain of isotopes ( isotones ) , can be viewed as an opening in the configuration space and described without changing the hamiltonian .",
    "the many - body nuclear hamiltonian in this formulation does not describe just one isolated nucleus @xmath124 , but all nuclei and all nuclear states that are coupled through various decays and captures .",
    "this idealization offers a right physical picture of the many - body system and its interactions .",
    "already early applications of gsm to the helium chain revealed the essential role of many - body continuum states in the binding mechanism of @xmath119he ( bound ) , @xmath125he ( unbound ) , and @xmath126he ( bound ) .",
    "in addition , they demonstrated that the configuration mixing involving continuum space may significantly affect occupancies of different s.p .",

    "the resulting picture differs even further from that of the standard sm : the s.p .",
    "shell structure probed by gsm becomes a fragile concept in weakly bound nuclei @xcite .",
    "studies of many - body wave functions of gsm inform us how subspaces of discrete and scattering states are intertwined . having a complete basis which allows to describe bound , weakly - bound and unbound states on",
    "the same footing is the only way to guarantee the unitarity .",
    "this fundamental requirement is not respected in any cqs formulation of the many - body theory . as shown in several examples , restoration of unitarity",
    "can strongly affect both values and behavior of spectroscopic factors .",
    "the unitarity lies also at the heart of the wigner threshold effect in the multichannel case .",
    "further consequences of the unitarity restoration on low - energy reactions , mirror symmetry - breaking , pairing correlations , and multi - nucleon decays , deserve further investigations .    over the last few years , the berggren ensemble and gsm became an accepted tool for nuclear structure studies .",
    "an efficient algorithm for finding discrete resonance states in the non - resonant continuum has been proposed @xcite and a new method , based on the application of the dmrg technique , was developed to tame the explosive growth of the fock space @xcite .",
    "recently , the berggren ensemble has been applied in an _ ab initio _ description of open quantum systems in a complex - energy coupled - cluster approach @xcite .",
    "the gsm serves also as a benchmark model to test other approaches to weakly bound states , such as the cosm @xcite .",
    "progress has been made in applying berggren ensembles to the mean - field description of nuclei through gamow - hfb .",
    "many challenging problems remain that could be illuminated with gsm  thanks to its ability to follow a quantum transition from a bound - state to unbound regime .",
    "for instance , gsm is an excellent tool to explain an ` alignment ' of a many - body wave function with a channel wave function in the vicinity of a channel threshold @xcite .",
    "this mechanism , which is a likely source of clustering effects seen near different threshold openings , can be studied in gsm .",
    "a near - threshold behavior of pairing correlations is an example from another domain where systematic gsm studies could be most helpful .",
    "that is probably a most transparent illustration of a near - threshold clustering .",
    "to improve the detailed description of bound and resonance states spectra in gsm , a development of effective interactions in rhs is an urgent need .",
    "this will open a possibility for investigations of configuration - mixing effects involving continuum states in certain isotope chains , e.g. , @xmath127li ( bound ) , @xmath48li ( unbound ) , @xmath46li ( bound ) , and @xmath128li ( unbound ) . in this example , gsm could provide a quantitative estimate of admixtures involving coupling of two neutrons ( one neutron ) with different states of @xmath127li ( @xmath48li ) in the ground state of @xmath46li .",
    "recent experimental studies of the neutron transfer reaction p(@xmath46li,@xmath129li)t @xcite provide a strong motivation .",
    "much effort has been devoted to studies of spectral degeneracies associated with the avoided level crossings , focusing mainly on the topological structure of the hilbert space and the geometric phases @xcite . among these degeneracies ,",
    "one finds exceptional points @xcite where two eigenfunctions and associated eigenvalues become equal . up to now , exceptional points have not been studied within rhs . in this respect , gsm could provide a first realistic and consistent many - body framework in which properties of wave functions close to a rhs singularity could be described .    in summary ,",
    "a complex - energy shell model opens a new window for unification of structure and reaction aspects of weakly bound or unbound nuclear states , based on the open quantum system framework .",
    "the developments reviewed here are not solely limited to nuclei ; they can be of interest in the context of other open quantum systems in which the coupling to the scattering continuum is present .",
    "to describe such systems , one has to give up either the concept of the hilbert space or the self - adjoint nature of the hamiltonian if one wants to keep the simplicity and conceptual and practical advantages of the standard sm framework .",
