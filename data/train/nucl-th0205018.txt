    "experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies devoted to @xmath0-meson production in nucleon - nucleon collisions have known a growing interest in recent years . in particular efforts",
    "have been focussed on the understanding of the reaction mechanism for @xmath7 , which is one of the simplest processes of vector meson production in @xmath8-collisions .",
    "the standard approach , based on one - boson exchanges in @xmath9channel ( the peripherical picture ) is not unique , in particular in the threshold region .",
    "a picture based on central @xmath8-collisions , with @xmath10channel excitation of six - quark bags @xcite , can also be applied to vector meson production in @xmath8-collisions @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the process @xmath7 , and in particular the study of polarization phenomena in @xmath11 can bring information on the hidden strangeness degrees of freedom in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "this problem is related with the possible violation of the ozi - rule @xcite for various processes of hadronic @xmath12 and @xmath0-production . in the framework of specific models @xcite in the near threshold region , it would be possible to determine or to constrain the coupling constants of the @xmath13-interaction , presently unknown .",
    "a suggestion was made @xcite , that a strong enhancement of the @xmath14 ratio in heavy ion collisions , in comparison with the value measured in @xmath15-collisions , could be interpreted as a signature of quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "search for such signal has been done in the cern experiment na38 @xcite .",
    "these examples show that the comprehension of the elementary process @xmath7 is important for nucleon - nucleon collisions and nucleon - nucleus collisions , as well .",
    "however , the reaction @xmath1 , where the nucleon participates in its first excited state , may also contribute to @xmath0-production in nuclei , in non negligible way . at bombarding energies of about 1 gev / a",
    ", a particular state of nuclear matter can be formed @xcite , where about 1/3 of baryons are excited to the @xmath16-resonance state .",
    "it follows that the @xmath0-meson in @xmath17- or @xmath18-collisions can be produced in non negligeable amount , through the process @xmath1 .",
    "the importance of @xmath5-reactions for the @xmath19-meson production has been considered earlier @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study @xmath3production in the process : @xmath20 , in particular in the near threshold region .",
    "the threshold region is interesting from an experimental point of view and the theoretical approach can be essentially simplified .",
    "the presence of the @xmath16-isobar , with 3/2 spin , makes the situation more complicated than in case of the nucleon , but also for the @xmath21 interaction it is possible to develop a formalism , similar to @xmath0-meson production in @xmath8 interaction @xcite .",
    "the symmetry properties of the strong interaction , such as the pauli principle for the nucleons , the p - invariance , the isotopic invariance and the selection rules for the total angular momentum , allow to define the spin structure of the matrix element for @xmath1 in terms of a small number of partial amplitudes .",
    "this approach is especially adapted to the near - threshold region , where all final particles are produced in s - state .",
    "the existing experimental data about @xmath3 and @xmath12-production in @xmath22collisions @xcite show that this region is quite wide .",
    "there is no particular reason to expect a different behavior in case of @xmath0-production in @xmath21-collisions . on the contrary ,",
    "taking into account the hidden strangeness of the @xmath0-meson , due to the relatively small @xmath23 radius of the nucleon @xcite , the @xmath24wave region for @xmath0-production should be larger than for @xmath12-production .",
    "a similar expectation has been also confirmed by experimental data on associative strange particle production in @xmath22collisions , in the near threshold region @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the first chapter",
    "we establish the spin structure of the threshold matrix for the process : @xmath1 . due to the isotopic invariance of the strong interaction",
    ", this spin structure applies to all possible combinations of the electric charge of baryons : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , because all these processes , in the @xmath31-channel , have a single value of isotopic spin , @xmath32 .",
    "the isotopic invariance is also very important with respect to the selection rules related to the p - parity and the total angular momentum . in chapter ii , using this parametrization , we show that any observable for the process @xmath1 can be calculated in terms of three independent partial amplitudes , which characterize this process in the threshold region",
    ". from all possible polarization observables , only the density matrix of the @xmath0-meson has a physical meaning , as this process can in principle occur only inside nuclei .",
    "after this model independent analysis , we consider the one - boson model , with @xmath33-exchange , taking into account the part of this mechanism related to the subprocess @xmath2 .",
    "this allows us to compare the present calculation with calculations on @xmath34-processes , without addition of new parameters , in the framework of the same model .",
    "the results are summarized in the conclusions .",
    "considering the @xmath16-isobar as a particle with spin 3/2 and positive p - parity , it is possible to find the spin structure of the process @xmath1 in threshold regime .",
    "the threshold region can be rigorously defined in the center of mass system ( cms ) of the considered reaction in terms of orbital angular momenta .",
    "if @xmath35 is the relative orbital momentum of the final nucleons and @xmath36 the orbital momentum of the @xmath0-meson , the condition of the @xmath24wave production of any pair of particles for the @xmath13 final state can be written as @xmath37 .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the threshold region may be quite wide for the @xmath0-meson , due to the fact that the region of the nucleon responsible for strange particle production is small . assuming the strange radius @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the kaon mass",
    ", semi - classical considerations suggest that for @xmath40 ( q is the @xmath0-meson momentum in cms ) the @xmath24approximation is justified .",
    "such consideration was applied in the phenomenological analysis @xcite of @xmath0-meson production in @xmath8-collisions .",
    "the spin structure of the threshold matrix element for any process @xmath1 can be established in a general form , from the selection rules in isotopic spin , @xmath41-parity and the total angular momentum . from the isotopic invariance of the strong interaction",
    ", one can find that any pair of final nucleons in all reactions @xmath1 ( for any charge combination , @xmath4 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) has to be in singlet state , following the generalized pauli principle . due to the conservation of the total isotopic spin , @xmath44",
    ", the final @xmath22system must have @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the total angular momentum @xmath45 and the @xmath41-parity of the entrance channel can take only the value @xmath46 .",
    "taking into account the conservation of @xmath45 and @xmath41 , one can find the following allowed partial transitions for the process",
    "@xmath1 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the total spin of the initial @xmath49-system and @xmath50 is the angular orbital momentum of this system .",
    "the threshold matrix element , in the cms of the considered reaction , can be parametrized in the following general form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) is the two - component spinor of the initial ( final ) nucleon ; @xmath55 is a particular two - component spinor ( each component is a vector ) for the description of the polarization properties of the @xmath16-isobar ( with spin 3/2 ) , so that @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the three - vector of the @xmath58-meson polarization , and @xmath59 is the unit vector along the 3-momentum of the @xmath16 ; @xmath60 are the threshold partial amplitudes describing the allowed transitions ( [ eq : tran ] ) .",
    "the presence of the pauli matrix @xmath61 in the parametrization ( [ eq : mel ] ) insures the correct transformation properties of the corresponding two - component spinor products , relative to rotation .    taking into account the conservation of isospin ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath62 i.e. the same set of three amplitudes @xmath60 describes all these processes and therefore the polarization phenomena have to be identical for all reactions @xmath1 .    after summing over the polarizations of the final particles and averaging over the polarizations of the colliding baryons",
    ", one can find the following formula for the differential cross section of the considered process , in terms of the partial amplitudes @xmath60 : @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the element of phase - space for the three - particle final state .",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 are the energies of the colliding @xmath68 and @xmath16 at threshold , in cms : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the masses of @xmath68 , @xmath16 and @xmath0-meson respectively .",
    "we used the following expression for the density matrix of the unpolarized @xmath16-isobar : @xmath73 where the overline denotes the sum over the @xmath16-polarization .",
    "the general parametrization of the threshold matrix element , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mel ] ) , allows to calculate any polarization observable , for the considered processes .",
    "taking into account the specificity of this reaction , which can only occur as a second step in ion - ion collisions , the most interesting ( and measurable ) polarization observable is the density matrix of the @xmath0-meson , which can be written ( for s - state final particles ) as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a real coefficient , which drives the angular dependence of the decay products of the @xmath0-meson .",
    "for example , in case of @xmath76-decay , one finds @xmath77 , with @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the k - meson production angle ( in @xmath0-rest system ) with respect to the direction of the initial @xmath16-momentum .",
    "the parametrization of the spin structure of the threshold matrix elements given above , is based on fundamental symmetry properties of the strong interaction .",
    "it is therefore model independent and can be applied to any reaction mechanism . following the analogy with the process",
    "@xmath11 , we will consider here different @xmath9channel exchanges ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , where only states with @xmath32 are allowed : @xmath33 , @xmath81 , etc .",
    "the spin structure of the corresponding matrix elements for the subprocesses @xmath82 can be established using the conservation of the total angular momentum and @xmath83parity .    at the reaction threshold , where the @xmath0-meson is produced in the @xmath84-state ,",
    "the following partial transitions are allowed : @xmath85 and @xmath86 , ( @xmath87 is the pion orbital momentum ) , so the matrix element can be written as follows : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the two complex partial amplitudes .    at the reaction threshold , this process is characterized by three possible partial transitions : @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , with the following matrix element : @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the threshold partial amplitudes for the process @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is the two - component spinor of the final nucleon .",
    "let us consider firstly the contribution of the diagrams 1(a ) , which are dominated by the known ( and measurable ) process @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding matrix element ( taking into account the necessary antisymmetrization with respect to the produced nucleons in @xmath1 ) , can be written as : @xmath100 @xmath101,\\ ] ] @xmath102 , \\label{eq : ms2b}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the @xmath104 coupling constant , for the decay @xmath105 , which determines the corresponding width as : @xmath106 in the threshold region for @xmath107 , the pion propagators in @xmath108 and @xmath109 are identical .",
    "this approximation is consistent with the previous s - wave considerations .",
    "a difference in these propagators , which appears outside the threshold region , generates p- and higher partial waves of the produced @xmath13-system .    using the fierz - transformation , in its two - component form",
    ", one can transform the matrix element @xmath110 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ms2b ] ) , to the canonical ( @xmath31-channel ) parametrization , eq .",

    ", one can find the following expressions for the partial threshold amplitudes @xmath60 of the process @xmath1 , which hold in framework of the considered model : @xmath115 from these expressions one can see that both amplitudes @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the subprocess @xmath2 contribute and the differential cross section for @xmath1 , can be written as ( in a particular normalization ) : @xmath116    taking into account that in the considered model the parameter @xmath117 , eq .",

    "the spin structure of the matrix element is characterized by a single contribution @xcite , corresponding to singlet - triplet transition , of the following form : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the corresponding amplitude , so that : @xmath129 the @xmath33-exchange for @xmath126 is described by four feynman diagrams ( to have the correct symmetry properties with respect to the initial and final identical protons ) .",
    "it is possible to prove that : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the threshold value of the momentum transfer squared , for _ elastic _ @xmath0-production .",
    "one can see that for the process @xmath126 only the @xmath89 amplitude contributes , therefore the proportionality of cross sections , eq .",
    "( [ eq : prop ] ) , does not hold for @xmath4-collisions .",
    "the complete determination of the amplitudes @xmath89 and @xmath90 requires the study of polarization phenomena for the process @xmath2 , in the near threshold region .",
    "the simplest observable is the polarization of the @xmath0-meson , determined by the single parameter @xmath132 , which can be expressed in terms of the partial amplitudes @xmath89 and @xmath90 as : @xmath133 therefore the measurement of the unpolarized cross section , @xmath134 , and of the coefficient @xmath132 allows to determine both amplitudes , through the following formulas : @xmath135    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq : eq12 ] ) , and ( [ eq : eq13 ] ) one can find the following formula for the ratio of the total threshold cross sections of the processes @xmath1 and @xmath11 in terms of the coupling constants and of the ratio @xmath136 of the two possible amplitudes for the @xmath2 process : @xmath137 where in the integration over the final @xmath138-system in @xmath126 we have taken into account the identity of the final protons .",

    "( [ eq : eq4 ] ) : @xmath141 so that @xmath142 .",
    "one can see that these two observables are not independent , in the framework of the considered model .",
    "the comparison of the cross sections for @xmath4 and @xmath5-collisions in eq ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) has to be done at the same excitation energy @xmath143 , where @xmath144 , and @xmath145 is the total invariant energy of the colliding particles , @xmath146 .    one can show that the threshold value for the variable @xmath147 in the case of the reaction @xmath1 is smaller in absolute value in comparison with @xmath11 , due to the different masses of @xmath16 and @xmath68 : @xmath148 as a result , the pion pole in @xmath1 is closer to the physical region , so the ratio @xmath149 will increase the relative value of the @xmath5-cross section .",

    "one can find @xmath158 , i.e. the processes @xmath11 and @xmath1 have comparable cross section , in the threshold region . a more accurate estimation for @xmath119 and @xmath159",
    "could be done , knowing the threshold partial amplitudes @xmath160 and @xmath90 . in literature",
    "@xcite it is possible to find an estimation of the energy dependence of the total cross section ( with unpolarized particles ) in the framework of a very specific resonance model where a single nucleon resonance contributes .",
    "the mass and width of this effective resonance were determined by fitting the available experimental data @xcite .",
    "such model , however , can not help to determine the partial amplitudes @xmath160 and @xmath90 without additional assumptions , concerning the spin and parity of the resonance @xmath161 and its coupling constants for the vertex @xmath162 .    in principle",
    "it is possible to develop a more complicated model for the @xmath2 process , which takes into account different contributions : vector meson exchange in @xmath147-channel , @xmath68 and @xmath163 contributions in @xmath31- and @xmath164-channels @xcite .",
    "but even near the reaction threshold several resonances with @xmath165 and @xmath93contribute , introducing unknown parameters , coupling constants and form factors . only in the framework of a quark model @xcite definite predictions can be done .",
    "let us apply the @xmath81-exchange for the elementary process @xmath82 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , to estimate the value of the ratio @xmath139 .",
    "one can easily see that , in the near threshold region , such model gives @xmath166 and the minimal value for the ratio of cross section @xmath159 . in this case one",
    "finds @xmath167 , with a @xmath168-angular dependence of the decay products in @xmath169 , which is an evident property of the @xmath170-vertex .",
    "this last result does not depend on the different ingredients of the reaction mechanism , such as the coupling constants and the phenomenological form factors in the hadronic vertexes , but it depends on the mechanism chosen for the process @xmath98 .",
    "however , as in the case of @xmath2 , one can expect that these contributions ( nucleon exchanges in @xmath31-and @xmath164-channels , nucleon resonances @xmath163-excitations ) are small in the near threshold region .",
    "it is possible to analyze in the same way the @xmath81-exchange for the process @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding analytical analysis can be done in terms of the partial threshold amplitudes for the subprocesses @xmath171 and @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the virtual @xmath81-meson , with space - like four - momentum . for numerical estimation",
    "an adequate dynamical model has to be built for such exotic subprocesses .",
    "for @xmath171 one can apply vdm , which connects this process to @xmath0-electroproduction in threshold conditions . the process",
    "@xmath174 , even at threshold , is characterized by a complicated spin structure , with five independent partial amplitudes .",
    "we have studied the reactions @xmath1 in the near threshold region on the basis of the most general symmetry properties of the strong interaction ( p - parity and angular momentum conservation , as selection rules ) and treating the dynamical aspects in the framework of one - boson mechanism .",
    "let us summarize the main results of our analysis .",
