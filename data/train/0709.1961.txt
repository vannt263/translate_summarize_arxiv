    "the dynamics of a two - level with sinusoidal coupling has been of interest since the time of bloch and siegert @xcite .",
    "the ( closely related ) basic model for a two - level system coupled to a simple harmonic oscillator was considered by cohen - tannoudji et al @xcite .",
    "the coupling in these models produces an increase in the two - level system transition energy ( sometimes termed the bloch - siegert shift ) . as the coupling strength is increased , the levels shift relative to one another , producing both level crossings and level anticrossings .",
    "level crossings occur when the dressed two - level transition energy matches an even number of oscillator quanta ( in which case the parity of the states are mismatched , so no mixing occurs ) .",
    "level anticrossings occur when the dressed two - level transition energy is resonant with an odd number of oscillator quanta , with the magnitude of the splitting indicative of the ability of the coupled system to convert energy between the two different degrees of freedom .",
    "these models were studied initially in the context of spin dynamics in a magnetic field @xcite , but they also appear in other applications .",
    "the coupling between atoms and an electromagnetic field can in some cases be described by these models , in which case the resonances mentioned above correspond to multiphoton interactions .",
    "multiphoton resonances in which a substantial number of photons are exchanged have become experimentally accessible recently @xcite . in part because of this there has been renewed interest in the multiphoton regime @xcite .",
    "we have found a unitary transformation which produces a rotated version of the problem which appears to provide a clean separation between terms which produce most of the bloch - siegert shift , and terms which produce the level splitting at the anticrossings .",
    "this is interesting because it allows us to develop estimates when the coupling is moderately strong for both the shift and the splittings using conventional methods on the rotated problem .",
    "in essence , we are able to capture most of the level splitting in the multiphoton regime in terms of first - order coupling in the context of degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "this provides a new way to look at the problem which may be useful .",
    "the hamiltonian for the coupled two - level system and oscillator of interest ( the spin - boson hamiltonian ) can be written as    @xmath0    where the @xmath1 are the pauli matrices .",
    "since we are interested in the multiphoton regime , we assume that the background excitation of the photon field is large :    @xmath2    rotations are often used to simplify hamiltonians @xcite ; however , in this case our rotation will make the problem more complicated mathematically but perhaps simpler functionally as outlined above .",
    "we consider the unitary equivalent hamiltonian    @xmath3    where    @xmath4    the rotated hamiltonian , @xmath5 can be broken up into an unperturbed part ( @xmath6 ) , and pieces which will be considered as perturbations ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) :    @xmath9    where    @xmath10    @xmath11 ^ 2   } \\right ] ( \\hat{a}-\\hat{a}^\\dagger ) \\right .\\ ] ] @xmath12 ^ 2   } \\right ] \\right \\rbrace \\hat{\\sigma}_y\\ ] ]    @xmath13 ^ 2   }   \\right \\rbrace^2\\ ] ]    in the multiphoton regime of interest here ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , the last term produced by the rotation , @xmath8 , is small ; we will therefore neglect it in what follows .",
    "consider first the eigenvalue equation of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath6 in the rotated frame    @xmath16    separation of variables allows us to develop solutions of the form    @xmath17    where @xmath18 satisfies    @xmath19u(y ) + m \\sqrt{\\delta e^2 + 8 v^2 y^2 } u(y)\\ ] ]    both from numerical calculations and the wkb approximation we have found that the energy eigenvalues are given approximately by    @xmath20    the wkb approximation can be used to develop a useful analytic approximation to the dressed two - level transition energy @xmath21 , which we may write as    @xmath22    with @xmath23 .",
    "the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath24 is    @xmath25    in the limit of large @xmath26 and @xmath27 where this is valid , the rotated system governed by @xmath6 alone behaves like a dressed two - level system ( with increased transition energy ) and an unperturbed oscillator .    the condition for bloch - siegert resonances can be written as    @xmath28    level crossings occur in the modified version of the problem described by the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath6 in the rotated frame . as level",
    "anticrossing occur in the original spin - boson model at these resonances , the coupling that is responsible for the level anticrossing has been eliminated in @xmath6 .",
    "this is an interesting and perhaps unexpected feature of this rotation .",
    "near a resonance , we can use a two - level description to account for the level splittings .",
    "@xmath29    two levels with energies @xmath30 and @xmath31 that depend on the dimensionless coupling strength @xmath24 cross , and couple to each other with an interaction @xmath32 which we assume to be constant in the vicinity of the resonance . at resonance ( @xmath33 ) , the two levels in this simplified model are degenerate    @xmath34    the splitting between the two levels at this point is twice the magnitude of the interaction    @xmath35    the level splittings in the case of weak coupling have been known for some time @xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "shirley s results written in our notation are    @xmath36    we have plotted results from the direct numerical solution of the spin - boson hamiltonian [ equation ( [ eq : basichamiltonian ] ) ] , and also for the this weak coupling result in . when the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath24 is small the results match well ; when the coupling gets stronger , we see ( as expected ) that perturbation theory begins to break down .",
    "= 4.00 in = 2.70 in    [ h ]",
    "the dressed transition energy of the two - level system is described reasonably well through the unperturbed part @xmath6 of the rotated hamiltonian , but no level splittings occur in the eigenvalues of @xmath6 .",
    "hence , all of the splitting must be due to the terms we have considered to be perturbations . in this section , our goal is to apply degenerate perturbation theory in the rotated frame to see whether the larger of the perturbation terms @xmath7 can account for the level splitting .",
    "to calculate the level splitting in the vicinity of an anticrossing , we need to compute the eigenkets @xmath37 of @xmath6 where    @xmath38    this can be done numerically , or by using the wkb approximation ( which we have found to be effective for such problems ) . near the @xmath39th resonance ,",
    "the level anticrossing is well - described by a simple two - level approximation    @xmath40    the energy splitting at resonance is    @xmath41    = 4.00 in = 2.70 in    [ t ]    in we have plotted level splittings taken from a direct numerical solution of the original spin - boson hamiltonian [ equation ( [ eq : basichamiltonian ] ) ] and also from first - order degenerated perturbation theory as discussed here ( we used numerical solutions for the eigenfunctions @xmath37 for this result ) .",
    "we can see from that the exact numerical results for the level splitting of the unrotated hamiltonian match very well the results obtained by using degenerate perturbation theory on the rotated hamiltonian .",
    "minor deviations occur at the larger @xmath24 values which we attribute to the omission of higher - order terms in the degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "we have found a useful unitary transformation that produces a rotated hamiltonian for the spin - boson problem in the multiphoton regime that has interesting properties .",
    "the rotated hamiltonian is more complicated mathematically than the initial spin - boson hamiltonian , but appears to be simpler in terms of functionality .",
    "one part of the rotated hamiltonian is identified as an unperturbed hamiltonian ( @xmath6 ) which appears to describe the coupled systems reasonably well away from the level anticrossings .",
    "this part of the problem is useful for developing estimates of the bloch - siegert shift .",
    "another part of the rotated hamiltonian ( @xmath7 ) is identified as a perturbation which is responsible for most of the coupling which occurs at the anti - crossing .",
    "used with first - order degenerate perturbation theory , this term provides a reasonable approximation for the level splittings at the bloch - siegert resonances .",
    "finally , there is present an additional term ( @xmath8 ) in the rotated hamiltonian which is small ( so that we have neglected it in our discussion here ) , but which can provide a minor correction to the dressed two - level system energies .",
