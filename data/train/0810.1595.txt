    "molecular machines are protein molecules which can transform chemical energy into ordered internal mechanical motions .",
    "the classical examples of such machines are molecular motors kinesin and myosin , where internal mechanical motions are used to transport cargo along microtubules and filaments .",
    "many enzymes operate as machines , using internal conformational motions to facilitate chemical reactions .",
    "other kinds of machines , operating as ion pumps or involved in genetic processes , are also known . moreover ,",
    "artificial nonequilibrium nanodevices , similar to protein machines , are being developed @xcite .",
    "the cycle of a protein machine is typically powered by chemical energy supplied with an atp molecule .",
    "when an atp molecule binds to a protein machine , the initial protein - atp complex is out of equilibrium and the process of ordered conformational relaxation of this complex towards its equilibrium state starts .",
    "when this state is reached , atp is converted into adp and this product molecule leaves the complex .",
    "the emerging free protein molecule is out of equilibrium and another conformational relaxation process , returning the free protein to its original equilibrium state begins .",
    "thus , the cycle consists of two conformational motions .",
    "it is important to note that the forward and back conformational motions inside each cycle do not coincide - they correspond to relaxation processes in two different physical objects , i.e. the free protein and the protein - atp complex @xcite .",
    "recently , much attention has been attracted to microscale swimmers operating at low reynolds numbers .",
    "generally , it can be shown that any physical object , cyclically changing its shape in such a way that the internal forward and back motions are different , propels itself through the liquid @xcite .",
    "elementary models of such swimmers , constructed by joining together mobile links @xcite or by connecting a few spheres by several actively deformable links @xcite , have been considered .",
    "typically , the concept of molecular swimmers is applied to explain active motion of bacteria and other microorganisms . however , individual macromolecules that operate actively as machines are also capable of self - motion @xcite    if a swimmer is attached to some support , preventing its translational motion , it exhibits force acting on the mechanical support .",
    "the generated force is equal to the stall force which needs to be applied to a swimmer to prevent its translational motion .",
    "when many swimmers are attached to a distributed support , their collective operation produces mechanical pressure acting on the support .",
    "this situation is , for example , encountered for molecular machines representing active protein inclusions ( such as ion pumps ) in biological membranes .",
    "it has been shown that the combined effects of the mechanical forces generated by the machines and their lateral motions inside the membrane can lead to membrane instabilities @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate a different situation involving molecular machine populations .",
    "we consider hypothetical machines which are floating on top of a thin liquid layer and thus represent _ active surfactants _",
    "( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "because the considered surfactant molecules are microswimmers , they generate local pressure applied to the liquid - air interface and proportional to their local concentration .",
    "additionally , they are subject to surface diffusion and , as surfactants , also modify local surface tension .",
    "our main analytical result , supported by numerical simulations , is that , if the surface density of machines is sufficiently high and if the rate of supply of chemical energy to the machine population exceeds a threshold , the equilibrium flat interface becomes unstable and hydrodynamical flows inside the liquid layer spontaneously develop .",
    "this instability is accompanied by spatial redistribution of floating machines and their collective motions over the surface .",
    "it leads to the emergence of a special kind of surface turbulence .",
    "such phenomena can provide the basis for active microfluidics , where hydrodynamical motions in liquid layers are induced and controlled by molecular machines located at the surface .",
    "the next two sections are devoted to the derivation and the stability analysis of a model of such molecular swimmers attached to the surface of a thin liquid film .",
    "a collection of numerical results is presented in section iv .",
    "finally , a model and numerical results are discussed , and some estimates of the forces of such molecules are given .",
    "the possible experimental realization is also discussed .",
    "population of identical molecular machines floating on the surface of a thin liquid film will be considered .",
    "these machines perform cycles of conformational changes ( with a characteristic time @xmath0 ) enabled by the supply of energy through atp molecules present in the liquid .",
    "we are interested in macroscopic collective effects and do not specify the details of machine operation .",
    "it will be assumed that , on the average , each machine generates the force which is applied to the air - liquid interface .",
    "this average force acts along the normal direction ( the forces in the lateral direction vanish after averaging because of the rotational diffusion ) .",
    "each machine cycle is initiated by binding of an atp molecule and the average force is proportional to the cycle frequency . assuming that binding of atp molecules follows the michaelis - menten law , the average force per machine molecule is    @xmath1}{k_{atp}+[atp]}. \\label{atp}%\\ ] ]    here",
    ", @xmath2 is the maximal force under the atp saturation conditions , @xmath3   $ ] denotes the atp concentration in the liquid , and @xmath4 is the characteristic concentration at which saturation begins .    because of the cycles",
    ", the floating machines produce additional pressure acting on the air - liquid interface .",
    "this pressure @xmath5 is proportional to the local surface concentration of the machines and the average force generated by an individual machine , i.e. @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the force per mol of molecules ( @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the avogadro number ) .",
    "note that the machines are still sufficiently well separated one from another and possible synchronization effects of their cycles ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) are therefore neglected .    before proceeding to the detailed formulation of the model , we want to outline the origin of the expected surface instability .",
    "suppose that the average force , generated by machines is directed upwards and therefore the machines are pulling the liquid up in the vertical direction ( fig .",
    "if machine concentration is increased in some region , the pulling pressure is higher in this region , inducing local rise in the liquid film thickness .",
    "this however leads to lateral hydrodynamical flows which are directed inwards and bring even more machines into the region . as a result ,",
    "the positive feedback , responsible for the instability , is established .",
    "note that surface diffusion of floating machines and capillary forces are acting in the opposite direction , suppressing the instability .",
    "thus , it is observed only if the average force @xmath10 generated by a machine is large enough , setting a threshold in terms of the energy supply rate ( i.e. , of the atp concentration in the solution ) .",
    "the instability is not possible when the force is downwards directed , thus inducing local depressions of the liquid layer ( fig .",
    "2b ) , then , in contrast to the previous case , hydrodynamical flows remove machines from the depression , restoring the equilibrium flat film .",
    "temporal evolution of the surface concentration field @xmath11 is described by the equation :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the lateral fluid velocity and @xmath14 is the surface diffusion .",
    "floating proteins represent surfactants and reduce the surface tension of the interfaces ( see @xcite ) . to take this effect into account",
    ", we assume that the surface tension coefficient @xmath15 decreases linearly with the machine concentration , @xmath16    hydrodynamical flows , induced by the gradients in machine concentration , should be further considered .",
    "we assume that the liquid layer is so thin that the lubrication approximation , typically employed in microfluidics @xcite , is justified . as shown in appendix a , the evolution equation for the local hight @xmath17 of the interface has the form    @xmath18    where the local pressure is @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the viscosity of the fluid . determining the lateral flow velocity at the interface ( see appendix a ) and substituting it into the evolution equation for the surface concentration ,",
    "a closed set of two partial differential equations is obtained .",
    "explicitly , the considered dynamics of thin films with active surfactants is described by equations :    @xmath21 \\nonumber\\\\ &   + \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\sigma_{c}\\vec{\\nabla}\\left (   \\frac{h^{2}}{2}\\vec{\\nabla } c\\right )   , \\label{dth}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath22 \\nonumber\\\\ &   + \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\sigma_{c}\\vec{\\nabla}\\left (   ch\\vec{\\nabla}c\\right ) + d\\nabla^{2}c . \\label{dtc}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that we have assumed that the active surfactant is insoluble @xcite .    for subsequent analysis , it is convenient to write these equations in the dimensionless form .",

    "the parameter @xmath34 specifies the magnitude of the pressure generated by the cycling molecular machines ; it is controlled by the rate of energy supply to the system .",
    "finally , @xmath35 is the dimensionless diffusion coefficient of floating machines .    comparing the last terms in equation ( [ ptc2 ] ) , we notice that spreading of floating machines , induced by changes in the surface tension , has the same functional form as surface diffusion .",
    "if relative variations of the film thickness and machine concentration are small ( @xmath36 ) , the effective diffusion coefficient of this process is @xmath33 .",
    "our estimates below in sect .",
    "v indicate that the genuine diffusion constant @xmath35 of floating machines is typically much smaller than the effective diffusion constant @xmath33 . having this in mind",
    ", we retain the terms including the coefficient @xmath35 in our analytical investigations , but put @xmath37 when numerical simulations of the model are performed .",
    "results with non - zero diffusion coefficient have been also obtained but they are very close to the results with @xmath37 .",
    "as shown in appendix a , the dimensionless horizontal ( @xmath38 ) and vertical ( @xmath39 ) velocities of the liquid film at hight @xmath40 and horizontal spatial location @xmath41 can be found as @xmath42 @xmath43 when the fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 are known .",
    "both velocities vanish at the bottom of the liquid film , at @xmath46 , because of the no - penetration and no - slip boundary conditions imposed there .",
    "the model always has the stationary uniform state @xmath47 . to perform the linear stability analysis of this state ,",

    "can predicted interface instabilities be experimentally observed ?",
    "this question has both chemical and physical aspects . on the chemical side",
    ", it is known that proteins may indeed represent surfactants and thus float at the air - water interface ( see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although we can not give here a specific example , it seems plausible that some protein machines also belong to this class .",
    "moreover , other protein machines , including molecular motors , can probably be made floating by chemical modification , i.e. by attaching to them a hydrophobic group .",
    "the physical question is whether the propulsion forces generated by individual protein machines would be sufficient to induce the considered interface instability . according to equation ( [ boundary ] ) ,",
    "the instability is reached when @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "taking into account the definitions of dimensionless properties @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the instability condition implies that the propulsion force @xmath100 generated by a single machine , must exceed the threshold    @xmath101    where @xmath23 is the film thickness , @xmath25 is the surface concentration of floating machines , @xmath14 is their surface diffusion constant , @xmath20 is the liquid viscosity , @xmath9 is the avogadro number , and @xmath102 specifies the surfactant capacity of the considered biomolecules ( the surface tension coefficient @xmath15 depends as @xmath103 on their concentration @xmath11 ) .    for numerical order - of - magnitude estimates , we choose @xmath104 g @xmath105s@xmath106 ( the viscosity of water ) , @xmath107 @xmath108s@xmath106 ( characteristic diffusion constant of large biomolecules in water solutions @xcite ) . based on the experimental data given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take furthermore @xmath109 .",
    "both terms in equation ( [ force ] ) are inversely proportional to the liquid film thickness @xmath23 and the smaller critical forces are therefore expected for the thicker layers .",
    "note , however , that this result is based on the lubrication approximation for thin liquid films , requiring that the film thickness is much smaller than the characteristic wavelength of the flow patterns .",
    "as we have seen , the characteristic wavelength of the interface turbulence in the considered system depends on the distance from the critical point ( cf . equation ( [ wavenumber ] ) ) and , in principle , can be arbitrarily large sufficiently close to the instability threshold . taking into account experimental limitations making it very difficult to work too close to the threshold , we choose however @xmath110 as the characteristic maximum film thickness",
    ".    concentration @xmath25 of floating proteins enters only into the second term in equation ( [ force ] ) .",
    "this term , depending on surface diffusion of floating machines , can be neglected in comparison with the first term , if the condition @xmath111 with @xmath112 holds . substituting numerical values ,",
    "we get @xmath113 .",

    "is estimated as @xmath114 note that it does not depend on the protein concentration .",
    "substitution of the numerical values into equation ( [ force1 ] ) yields @xmath115 .",
    "can a single molecular machine generate the hydrodynamical propulsion force of that magnitude ?",
    "direct measurements of molecular propulsion forces are still not available .",
    "it is known that molecular motors , such as myosin or kinesin , can generate mechanical forces of about @xmath116 @xcite , but these data refers to the molecules moving along microtubules and filaments , not to the swimmers .    for a simple example , we consider the elementary three - body purcell swimmer @xcite .",
    "its characteristic propulsion velocity is about @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the displacement per single cycle and @xmath119 is the characteristic time of the cycle ( cf .",
    "the viscous friction force of an object of linear size @xmath120 that moves with velocity @xmath121 through the liquid is by the order - of - magnitude @xmath122 .",
    "thus , propulsion at velocity @xmath123 would require the propulsion force about @xmath124 .",
    "choosing @xmath125 nm , @xmath126 and @xmath127 ms and considering water as the liquid , we obtain for the molecular propulsion force the rough estimate of @xmath128pn .",
    "similar estimates are obtained for other known elementary swimmers .",
    "note that the actual average propulsion force @xmath10 of a machine additionally depends on the frequency of machine cycles and the angle with respect the interface , therefore , according to equation ( [ atp ] ) , this gives the estimate of the maximum propulsion force under the energy - supply saturation conditions and the most efficient orientation of the machine .    while molecular propulsion forces are quite small , according the above estimates they would still be sufficient to induce the film instability and lead to the interface turbulence .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the experimental observation of the predicted effects is _ principally possible_.    the experiments aimed at detecting instabilities of thin liquid layers induced by floating actively operating machines would allow to directly estimate actual propulsion forces generated by particular biomolecules",
