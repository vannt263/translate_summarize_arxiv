    "the unit vector along direction @xmath14 is denoted by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) . in all simulations in this paper , a fully occupied initial condition and periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "the algorithm begins with a random selection of a particle in the system . for convenience ,",
    "let us refer to the lattice vector of the site the selected particle resides as @xmath17 . with probability @xmath2 ,",
    "hopping is attempted to a target site which is chosen randomly among @xmath18 nearest neighbors of the site @xmath17 .",

    "will be attempted .",
    "when annihilation is decided , the selected particle will be irreversibly removed from the system .",

    "figure  [ fig : tcp ] depicts @xmath30 as a function of @xmath9 in semi - logarithmic scales , where @xmath34 is the critical density decay exponent of the dp class taken from ref .  @xcite .",

    "in sec .  [ sec : dp ] , we numerically confirmed that up to @xmath53 the tc does show continuous transition governed by the dp fixed point .",
    "although this refuted the previous claim  @xcite that the transition nature changes at a certain @xmath2 smaller than @xmath35 , the possibility of the discontinuous transition at @xmath54 is still open . to provide an evidence that the dp fixed point governs the critical behavior beyond @xmath33 , this section studies the phase boundary near @xmath55 with the focus on a possible crossover .",
    "the investigation of the phase boundary to settle a controversy is not without precedent .",
    "the present author and his collaborator tried to resolve the controversy around the pair contact process with diffusion ( for a review , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) by studying the phase boundary of the crossover models  @xcite .",
    "although this study could not elicit a full consensus , it certainly gives a hint about the system .",
    "so we think it is worth while to investigate the phase boundary of the tc .",
    "but , in sec .  [ sec : dp ] , we have presented the simulation results only for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which is certainly not enough to see the structure of the phase boundary . for a better birds - eye view , we will include some other critical points for @xmath56 even though we will not be presenting details .    before directly analyzing the phase boundary",
    ", we will discuss some features of it which can be inferred without resorting to the nature of the transition .",
    "first , the transition point @xmath57 is argued to be an increasing function of @xmath2 .",
    "second , @xmath57 is expected to approach to the transition point of the mean field ( mf ) theory as @xmath58 . by the mf theory in this paper",
    "is exclusively meant the one - site approximation ( for a detail , one may consult sec .",
    "3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath59 which exhibits a discontinuous transition with the transition point @xmath60 .    to argue that @xmath57 increases with @xmath2 ,",
    "it is convenient to modify the tc by rescaling time @xmath61 .",
    "note that for @xmath62 , however close @xmath2 is to 1 , the steady state property of the modified model is identical to the original one . in this modified model ,",
    "a single particle dies out with rate @xmath6 and a triplet attempts to branch an offspring with rate @xmath20 . obviously , these rates are not dependent on @xmath2 .",
    "the diffusion rate is now @xmath63 which is an increasing function of @xmath2 .",
    "since the annihilation occurs regardless of the environment of a to - be - annihilated particle , the diffusion can not directly affect the particle number fluctuation due to the annihilation .",
    "on the other hand , the branching is influenced by the diffusion , since a triplet can be either broken or newly formed by the movement of particles .",
    "hence , whether the diffusion enhances or reduces the activity of the system for given @xmath6 can be answered by understanding if the diffusion will increase or decrease the number of active triplets , namely , triplets with a vacant neighbor .    due to the hard core exclusion",
    ", a cluster of particles will lose one by the diffusion only at _",
    "boundaries_. however , even if a cluster loses a single particle at a boundary , the number of active triplets does not decrease if the size of the cluster is larger than 3 ( it can even increase the number of active triplets if the configuration change due to the diffusion is like @xmath64 , where 1 stands for a particle and 0 for a vacancy ) .",
    "thus , the reduction of the number of active triplets by the diffusion occurs in very restricted situations . on the other hand",
    ", the diffusion can mediate the formation of ( active ) triplets in the _ bulk _ of region where none exists . to sum up",
    ", the diffusion tends to enhance the activity , which entails that the transition point should increase with @xmath2 .",
    "next , we will discuss the limiting value of @xmath57 as @xmath58 , which will be denoted by @xmath65 . to find @xmath65 ,",
    "we start from arguing that the tc under the @xmath58 limit is deeply related to the mf theory .",
    "this connection makes sense only when time is suitably rescaled as before . with this time scale ,",
    "the diffusion rate @xmath66 grows indefinitely as @xmath58 , but the annihilation and creation rates remain finite . from now on , we will call the limit @xmath67 the fast diffusion limit and the modified tc with rescaled time is always assumed when we are discussing the fast diffusion limit .",
    "a finite system under the fast diffusion limit can be interpreted as follows : right after any reaction ( either annihilation or creation ) , the system arrives at the steady state of the diffusion process in no time and remains there until another reaction occurs . in the steady state of the diffusion - only system , all possible configurations for given number of particles have equal probability .",
    "hence , the probability that a site is vacant and its three consecutive neighbors are occupied at time @xmath68 is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the system size and @xmath0 is the number of particles in the system at time @xmath68 , and @xmath71 .",
    "of course , the probability that a site is occupied at time @xmath68 is @xmath72 .",
    "since these probabilities do not depend on where the site is located , the probability distribution is fully specified by the number of particles and the master equation of the tc under the fast diffusion limit is reduced to @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , though the argument of it is not written explicitly , is the probability that there are @xmath0 particles at time @xmath68 . for convenience , we set @xmath77 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eq .   can be interpreted as follows : @xmath78 means each particle ( there are @xmath0 particles ) dies with rate @xmath6 and @xmath79 means that each vacant site ( there are @xmath80 vacant sites ) becomes occupied with rate @xmath81 , which is the dynamic rule of the tc on a fully connected graph .",
    "hence , the master equation of the tc on a fully connected graph is exactly eq .  .",
    "if we take the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath82 ) to eq .  , the law of large numbers has the density follow eq .  , that is , the mf theory .",
    "now it is clear why we used @xmath68 in eq .   as a time parameter . for convenience and because of an obvious reason",
    ", we will refer to the tc on a fully connected graph with finite size as the mf model .    although the fast diffusion limit was taken to arrive at the mf model in the above discussion",

    "to demonstrate why it is not likely , let us think about the situation where @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath70 is much larger than the correlation length for given @xmath6 and @xmath2 . as shown before ,",
    "the system with @xmath83 is well described by the mf model .",
    "since @xmath70 is assumed very large and this value of @xmath6 corresponds to the active phase of the mf theory , the mf model , and accordingly the tc itself with above mentioned parameters , stays at the steady state of the mf theory with nonzero density for long time of the order of @xmath111 ( note that time in this context is the rescaled time @xmath68 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the system size is assumed much larger than the correlation length and the system is in the absorbing phase by assumption , so the density should decay exponentially after time of the order of @xmath112 , which is contradictory to the previous consideration .",
    "of course , if the correlation length in this regime diverges faster than @xmath113 as @xmath58 , the assumption @xmath83 with @xmath70 larger than the correlation length is not valid .",

    "<S> although hinrichsen in his unpublished work theoretically rebutted the possibility of the discontinuous transition in one - dimensional nonequilibrium systems unless there are additional conservation laws , long - range interactions , macroscopic currents , or special boundary conditions , we have recently observed the resurrection of the claim that the triplet creation model ( tc ) introduced by dickman and tom [ phys . </S>",
    "<S> rev . </S>",
    "<S> e * 44 * , 4833 ( 1991 ) ] would show the discontinuous transition . by extensive simulations , however , we find that the one - dimensional tc does belong to the directed percolation universality class even for larger diffusion constant than the suggested tricritical point in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the phase boundary is well described by the crossover from the mean field to the directed percolation , which supports the claim that the one - dimensional tc does not exhibit a discontinuous transition . </S>"
