    "calorimeters that use erenkov light as signal source are , for all practical purposes , only responding to the em fraction of hadronic showers @xcite . by comparing the relative strengths of the signals representing the visible deposited energy and the erenkov light produced in the shower absorption process , the em shower fraction can be determined and the total shower energy can be reconstructed using the known @xmath3 value(s ) of the calorimeter represents the ratio of the average calorimeter signals per unit deposited energy from the em and non - em components of hadron showers . a calorimeter with @xmath4 is said to be _ compensating _ , but in practice almost all calorimeters have @xmath5 . ] .",

    "can we separate pions and protons in the cern sps h8 beam , and measure the dual - readout calorimeter performance separately for these particles ?    we also studied the performance for multi - particle `` jets , '' produced in high - multi - plicity interactions by the beam hadrons in an upstream target . in modern particle physics experiments ,",
    "the detection of jets is very important .",
    "the multiparticle events we used for our studies are , of course , not the same as the qcd jets that originate from a fragmenting quark or gluon . yet , for the purpose of calorimetry they are very useful , since they represent a collection of particles that enter the calorimeter simultaneously .",

    "-5 mm      -5 mm the dual - readout approach for measuring hadron showers exploits the fact that the energy carried by the non - em shower component of hadron showers is mostly deposited by non - relativistic shower particles ( protons ) , and therefore does not contribute to the signals of a erenkov calorimeter . by measuring simultaneously the visible deposited energy ( @xmath30 ) and the erenkov light generated in the shower absorption process , one can determine @xmath2 _ event by event _ and thus eliminate ( the effects of ) its fluctuations .",

    ".      -5 mm    in order to study the effectiveness of the described leakage counters , we first studied the correlation between the signals from these counters and the scintillation signals from the fiber calorimeter .",
    "the result , shown in figure [ lvss ] for 60 gev @xmath12 , indicates that there is indeed a good anti - correlation between the _ average _ signals .",
    "however , the resolution improvement depends of course on the _ event - by - event anti - correlation_. the counters turned out to be indeed somewhat effective in that respect .",
    "an extreme example of this effectiveness is shown in figure [ pi60cont ] , in which the signal distribution for all events ( figure [ pi60cont]a ) is compared with the signal distribution for the events in which _ no _ shower leakage was observed , the ( small fraction of the ) events that were entirely contained in the fiber calorimeter .",
    "the latter distribution exhibits an energy resolution that is almost a factor of two better , and is in addition well described by a gaussian function .",
    "these signal distributions were obtained with the standard dual - readout procedure ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "the signal distribution for all 60 gev @xmath12 events shows deviations from a gaussian shape .",
    "the type of deviations indicates that effects of light attenuation in the ( scintillating ) fibers are responsible for this @xcite .",
    "the response of the fibers is not uniform in depth .",
    "because of light attenuation , the response gradually increases as the light is produced closer to the pmts , deeper inside the calorimeter .",
    "the convolution of the attenuation curve with the longitudinal light production profile in hadron showers leads to a response function with the measured characteristics .",
    "the steeper the light attenuation curve , the more pronounced these effects become .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the effective light attenuation length increases with the distance to the light detector @xcite .",
    "an important feature responsible for this is the `` cladding light , '' which is much stronger attenuated than light trapped inside the fiber core .",
    "therefore , this cladding light contributes predominantly to the signals from energy deposited close to the light detector . by making the upstream end of the fibers reflective ,",
    "the attenuation curve becomes flatter , increasingly so as the distance to the light detector increases . in this way , effective attenuation lengths in excess of 8 m were obtained for the fibers in the spacal calorimeter @xcite .",
    "however , in our calorimeter , the open end of the fibers was not made reflective , and the attenuation length is therefore shorter .",
    "the effect of this is an additional contribution to the hadronic energy resolution which , in first approximation , is energy independent .",
    "this contribution , as well as the asymmetry of the response function , increases as the light is produced closer to the pmts , deeper inside the calorimeter .",
    "= 9.5 cm    to investigate these phenomena , we separated the events into sub - samples , based on the fraction of the total leakage signal that was measured in ring 1 of the leakage counters ( see figure [ leakcounters ] ) .",
    "figure [ lcuts]a shows the distribution of that fraction . in general , we may assume that a small fraction indicates that the scintillation light is , on average , produced deep inside the calorimeter , in the region where the light attenuation curve is steeper than for light produced close to the calorimeter s front face @xcite .",
    "figure [ lcuts]b shows that the asymmetry is indeed predominantly observed for events in which that fraction is small ( @xmath35 ) , events in which most of the energy was deposited deep inside the calorimeter , where the effects of light attenuation are largest .",
    "the signal distributions for the other events are much more gaussian ( figure [ lcuts]c ) .",
    "the average calorimeter signal is also somewhat smaller for these events , which is consistent with larger attenuation losses due to the longer path length of the light on its way to the pmt .",
    "these results indicate that light attenuation in the scintillating fibers was indeed a significant factor contributing to the hadronic energy resolution of this calorimeter . by comparing figures [ pi60cont]a and [ pi60cont]b",
    ", one may conclude that leakage fluctuations contributed the rest .",
    "= 5.5 cm    in order to investigate how effective the signals from the leakage counters were in reducing the effects of side leakage on the energy resolution , we compared the signal distributions for the 60 gev pions in which the leakage signals were added event by event to those from the scintillating fibers ( figure [ leffect]a ) with the signal distributions in which the fiber scintillation signals were all multiplied by a constant factor , representing the _ average _ leakage fraction ( figure [ leffect]b ) .",
    "the leakage counters did indeed improve the hadronic energy resolution significantly , albeit not as much as one might expect from a sufficiently enlarged fiber calorimeter .",
    "if we take the energy resolution of 6.4% ( figure [ pi60cont]b ) as the value for fully contained showers , then the contribution of leakage fluctuations to the resolution shown in figure [ leffect ] was reduced from 11.1% in the absence of any leakage detection ( figure [ leffect]b ) to 7.8% for the imperfect leakage detector used in these studies ( figure [ leffect]a ) .",
    "we have shown in the past that the light attenuation effects can be eliminated event by event through the time structure of the signals @xcite , or by placing the calorimeter at a small ( @xmath36 ) angle with the beam line @xcite .",
    "that information was not available during these tests .",

    "this beam is sent into the detector .",
    "the ( relative ) energy resolution is deemed to be represented by the ( fractional ) width of the distribution of the signals produced by the calorimeter in response to these particles .",
    "two important caveats should be mentioned in this context :    1 .",
    "since all particles typically enter the calorimeter in the same small area defined by the beam spot , the results are strictly speaking only valid for this particular part of the calorimeter .",
    "if the average signal varies with the impact point of the particles , which is often the case , then the real energy resolution is underestimated in this procedure .",
    "the width of the signal distribution measured in this way is only indicative for the energy resolution if the average calorimeter signal indeed represents the correct energy of the beam particles .",
    "this condition may not be met , for example , when the calorimeter is intrinsically non - linear and has been calibrated at a different energy than that of the beam particles .",
    "it is also not met when the average signals are different for different types of particles with the same energy ( @xmath46 ) and the beam composition is unknown .",
    "however , even when we assume that these caveats do not play a role for the calorimeter in question , one should realize that the procedure chosen to determine the energy resolution relies on the signal distribution from an ensemble of particles with the same energy .",
    "this is a crucial aspect of methods that attempt to improve the energy resolution by techniques known as _ offline compensation _ , or _",
    "particle flow analysis _",
    ", where the width of a signal distribution is reduced with an iterative procedure , in which calibration constants of the various calorimeter sections that contribute to the signals are varied until an optimal result is obtained .",
    "the procedure used to determine the energy resolution of the rd52 calorimeters , as described in the previous section , does _ not _ rely on the availability of an ensemble of events created by particles of the same energy .",
    "the particle energy is determined with a simple formula ( [ eq2 ] ) , which combines the values of two signals .",
    "the energy resolution is measured by comparing that calculated energy with the true energy of the particle that created the event .",
    "the availability of an ensemble of mono - energetic particles is not essential in this case .",
    "however , if measuring the energy resolution is considered equivalent to measuring the width of the signal distribution for an ensemble of mono - energetic beam particles , then the dual - readout method also offers an alternative approach , described below .",
    "this approach leads to resolutions that are considerably better than the ones mentioned in the previous section .",
    "-3 mm    figure [ drrotation]a shows a scatter plot of the erenkov signals the scintillation signals measured with this detector for 60 gev pions .",
    "the signals from the leakage counters were added to those from the scintillating fibers , using the fact that the measured shower profile indicated that the side leakage at this energy was , on average , 6.4% . the energy scale for both the erenkov and the scintillation signals",
    "is given in units of gev , derived from the calibration of these signals with electron showers .",
    "this scatter plot shows the data points located on a locus , clustered around a line that intersects the @xmath47 line at the beam energy of 60 gev .",
    "this is of course to be expected . in first approximation",
    ", the erenkov fibers only produced signals generated by the electromagnetic components of the hadron showers , predominantly @xmath39s .",
    "the larger the em shower fraction , the larger the @xmath48 signal ratio . events in which ( almost ) the entire hadronic energy was deposited in the form of em shower components thus produced signals that were very similar to those from 60 gev electrons and are , therefore , represented by data points located near ( 60,60 ) in this scatter plot .",
    "the fact that the data points cluster around a straight line in this plot is in agreement with groom s assessment of the fundamental aspects of dual - readout calorimetry @xcite .",
    "we can now rotate the scatter plot over the angle @xmath49 around this intersection point : @xmath50 and the result is shown in figure [ drrotation]b , for @xmath51 .",
    "the projection of this rotated scatter plot on the @xmath52-axis is shown in figure [ drrotation]c .",
    "this signal distribution is well described by a gaussian function with a central value of 61.0 gev and a relative width , @xmath0 , of @xmath53 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath1 .",
    "the narrowness of this distribution reflects the clustering of the data points around the axis of the locus in figure [ drrotation]a .",
    "we have applied exactly the same procedure for data taken at + 125 gev , + 80 gev , + 40 gev and + 20 gev , and obtained similar results .",
    "in addition , the use of positive polarity beams allowed us to separate the data into proton and @xmath54 samples .",
    "figure [ 80ppi ] shows the erenkov scintillation scatter plots for the 80 gev @xmath54 ( figure [ 80ppi]a ) and proton ( figure [ 80ppi]c ) signals .",
    "these plots show a significant difference between the pion and proton signals .",
    "the average erenkov signal is about 10% larger for the pions than for the protons , a consequence of the absence of leading @xmath39s in the proton showers .",
    "however , using the intersection of the axis of the locus and the @xmath47 point as the center of rotation , and the same rotation angle ( @xmath55 ) as for 60 gev , the resulting signal distributions had about the same average value : 80.7 gev for the pions ( figure [ 80ppi]b ) and 80.4 gev for the protons ( figure [ 80ppi]d ) .",
    "the widths of both distributions were also about the same : 2.60 gev for pions , 2.69 gev for protons .",
    "regardless of the differences between the production of @xmath39s ( and thus of erenkov light ) in these two types of showers , the signal distributions obtained after the dual - readout procedure applied here , were thus practically indistinguishable .",
    "we have applied exactly the same procedure for the 20 gev , 40 gev and the 125 gev particles , with very similar results . also here , the average erenkov signals in the raw data were significantly smaller for protons than for pions . however , after applying the same rotation procedure as for the 60 and 80 gev data ( always using the same rotation angle , @xmath51 ) , the resulting signal distributions were centered around approximately the same values , and also the relative widths of these distributions were approximately the same .",
    "the fact that the rotation angle used to achieve these results is independent of the particle type and the energy is consistent with groom s observation that this angle only depends on the energy independent value of the @xmath34 parameter defined in equation [ eq2 ] @xcite .",

    "this indicates that only stochastic fluctuations contribute to this width .",
    "the reconstructed energies are also somewhat lower in the case of the multiparticle events , more so at low energy ( figure [ jetresults]a ) .",
    "very substantial differences are observed in the size of the erenkov component , which is on average considerably smaller for the multiparticle events .",
    "= 7.5 cm    these features can be understood by realizing that the primary interaction of the beam particles took place at a distance of about 75 cm upstream of the calorimeter .",
    "low - energy secondaries produced in these interactions may have traveled at such large angles with the beam line that they physically missed the calorimeter , as well as the leakage counters surrounding the calorimeter .",
    "the effect of that is larger when the energy of the incoming beam particle is smaller .",
    "the increased side leakage is probably also the main factor responsible for the increased width of the signal distribution .",
    "the difference in the strength of the erenkov component most likely reflects the fact that the average energy fraction carried by the em component in hadronic showers increases with energy .",
    "therefore , if the energy of the incoming beam particle is split between at least six secondaries ( our trigger condition for multiparticle events ) , the total em energy fraction is likely to be smaller than when the beam particle enters the calorimeter and deposits its entire energy there in the form of a single hadronic shower .",
    "-5 mm    notice that we have _ not _ used any knowledge about the energy of the beam particles in the rotation procedure described in the previous subsections .",
    "the coordinates of the rotation center were chosen on the basis of the _ equality of the hadronic erenkov and scintillation signals_. this implies that the hadronic response at that point must be equal to that for electrons , which was used to set the energy scale for both types of calorimeter signals .",
    "the described method has thus allowed us to measure the energy of the beam particles with great precision .",
    "the average beam energy has been correctly reproduced within a few percent for all energies studied , the fractional width of the signal distribution scaled with @xmath45 and , most interestingly , the dual - readout signal distributions were found to be essentially identical for protons and pions , despite the substantial differences between the signal distributions for these particles measured in the scintillation or erenkov channels .",
    "the latter aspect is a unique feature of dual - readout calorimetry .",
    "no other calorimeter we know of is capable of this . atlas has reported significant differences between the signal distributions of protons and pions @xcite , but their `` offline compensation '' methods required prior knowledge of the particle type to eliminate these differences .    yet , while we have managed to obtain very narrow signal distributions for the beam particles using only the calorimeter information , we do nt think it is correct to interpret the relative width of these distributions as a measure for the precision with which the energy of an arbitrary particle absorbed in this calorimeter may be determined . the determination of the coordinates of the rotation point , and thus the energy scale of the signals , relied on the availability of an ensemble of events obtained for particles of the same energy . in practice , however , one is only dealing with _",
    "one _ event , of unknown energy , and the described procedure can thus not be used in that case .",
    "= 6.5 cm    the dream collaboration has developed a procedure to determine the energy of an unknown particle showering in the dual - readout calorimeter that is _ not _ affected by this problem . in this procedure ,",
    "described in section 3.1 , the em shower fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the hadronic shower is derived from the ratio of the erenkov and scintillation signals . using the known @xmath3 values of the two calorimeter structures , the measured signals can then be converted to the em energy scale ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the energy resolutions obtained with this method are worse than the ones given in this section , although it should be mentioned that they are dominated by incomplete shower containment and the associated leakage fluctuations , and are likely to improve considerably for detectors that are sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "however , the same is probably true for the measurements of which the results are shown in figure [ drrotation ] .",
    "figure [ dr2method ] graphically illustrates the difference between the values of the energy resolution obtained with the two methods discussed here .",
    "the precision of the energy measurement is represented by the arrows in the two diagrams .",
    "the message we want to convey in this section is that one should not confuse the precision of the energy determination of a given event based on calorimeter signals alone with the width of a signal distribution obtained in a testbeam , since the latter is typically based on additional information that is not available in practice . in the example described above ,",
    "this additional information derived from the fact that a large number of events generated by particles of the same energy were available . in other cases , additional information may be derived from knowledge of the particle energy .",
    "this is especially true for calorimeters whose energy scale depends on `` offline compensation , '' or other techniques intended to minimize the total width of the signal distribution from a detector system consisting of several longitudinal segments .",
    "such techniques rely on calibration constants whose values depend on the energy , on the type of showering particle , and sometimes also on the ratios of the signals from the different calorimeter sections .",
    "-5 mm    we have studied the hadronic performance of a lead - based dual - readout fiber calorimeter with beams of pions and protons of different energies , and with multiparticle events created by upstream interactions of these beam particles in a dedicated target .",
    "the assessment of the performance characteristics , and thus of the potential possibilities of this type of detector , was limited by the fact that the calorimeter was too small and used lead as absorber material . as has been pointed out elsewhere @xcite , a lower-@xmath65 absorber material such as copper",
    "would be much more suitable for this type of detector .",
    "however , we have not yet managed to identify a low - cost technique for mass production of the complicated absorber structure out of copper . on the other hand",
    ", lead could be extruded into the desired shape .",
    "we have demonstrated that the hadronic energy resolution of the tested calorimeter was dominated by fluctuations in lateral shower leakage .",
    "we have tried to mitigate these effects with a crude and rather non - hermetic system of leakage counters surrounding the calorimeter . this certainly improved the energy resolution significantly , but not nearly enough to eliminate the leakage effects .",
    "the effects of leakage on the energy resolution became clear by selecting events in which no measurable leakage occurred .",
    "for these events , the measured resolution was comparable to that of the best compensating calorimeters ever built .",
    "similar performance was achieved with an analysis method in which we made use of the availability of an ensemble of events caused by particles of the same energy .",
    "the availability of two signals that provided complementary information about the showers made it possible to determine the energy of the particles , independent of any additional information .",
    "a simple rotation procedure then led to signal distributions with all the characteristics of an ideal calorimeter : signal linearity , gaussian response functions with a very narrow width that scaled with @xmath45 , and the same response for pions and protons , whose responses differed substantially when measured in the scintillation or erenkov channels .    with the exception of the energy resolution ,",
    "similarly good performance was obtained with the standard dual - readout method , which can be applied for individual events .",
    "the width of the signal distribution which , as explained above , was dominated by lateral leakage fluctuations , was also in this case measured to be completely determined by stochastic fluctuations , as evidenced by the @xmath45 scaling .",
