    "it is generally accepted that nearly 23% of the universe s energy density resides in the form of non - luminous ` dark ' matter  @xcite .",
    "this is a new form of matter which is non - baryonic and manifests itself primarily through its gravitational interactions .",
    "the highly successful standard model ( sm ) of strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions does not possess a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "thus , new physics beyond the sm is required to incorporate dark matter , and many potential dark matter candidates have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry , more precisely mssm , ( minimal supersymmetric sm ) , with r - parity conservation , is arguably the most compelling extension of the sm .",
    "the mssm predicts the existence of a stable new elementary particle called the neutralino ( lightest supersymmetric particle ) . with mass of order 100",
    "tev , the thermal relic abundance of the lightest neutralino has the right order of magnitude to account for the observed dark matter density .",
    "many recent investigations of the mssm have focused on a theoretically well motivated special case called the cmssm @xcite ( constrained mssm , based on supergravity ) which is far more predictive than the generic mssm version .",
    "the latter can have more than a hundred free parameters , in contrast to the cmssm with just 5 or so parameters . in these investigations",
    "the stable neutralino is usually found to be relatively light ( 100few hundred gev ) , and its indirect discovery relies on detecting cosmic ray signals ( including positrons , antiprotons , gamma rays , etc . ) from neutralino decay or pair annihilation in the galactic halo , galactic center , and the haloes of nearby galaxies .",
    "the pamela experiment is currently taking data of high energy anti - proton and positron fluxes , and their most recent publication claims a significant positron ` excess '  @xcite with no corresponding anti - proton excess  @xcite .",
    "this result appears to confirm previous results from heat @xcite and ams @xcite within the error bars .",
    "it has been pointed out that pulsars and/or other nearby astrophysical sources may account for the pamela results  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the atic experiment  @xcite ( see also ppb - bets  @xcite ) has reported an appreciable flux of electrons and positrons at energies around 100  800 gev , which appears to be considerably higher than the expected background at these energies .    a unified explanation of the pamela and atic experiments involving neutralino as the dark matter candidate could be based on one of the following two mechanisms :    * the dark matter is a stable neutralino with mass around 700 gev which primarily annihilates into leptons through new interactions which lie outside the mssm framework @xcite . depending on the framework chosen , this scenario also invokes some ` boost ' factor physics such as sommerfeld enhancement  @xcite . *",
    "the dark matter is not entirely stable @xcite but extremely long - lived , with a lifetime @xmath0 sec . for neutralino dark matter , one could introduce suitably ` tiny ' r ( or ` matter ' )  parity violating couplings which satisfy the lifetime constraint and allow the neutralino to decay primarily into leptons .",
    "the tiny ( @xmath1 ) r - parity violating couplings can be understood through non - renormalizable couplings with additional discrete symmetries  @xcite .",
    "a simple example of this is provided by the r - parity violating superpotential coupling @xmath2 , which leads to a three - body decay mode for the neutralino  @xcite . with a neutralino mass of around 2 tev",
    ", this can simultaneously explain the pamela and atic data .",
    "if one ignores say the atic result , it is possible to explain the pamela observations with a decaying neutralino of mass @xmath3 gev , which would make supersymmetry , and in particular the sparticles , far more accessible at the lhc .",
    "even lighter ( @xmath4 ) neutralino mass is feasible in the annihilation scenario .    motivated by the pamela and atic observations we have performed an isajet @xcite based analysis of cmssm spectrocopy in which particular attention",
    "is paid to those regions of the cmssm parameter space which contain heavy ( @xmath3 gev  2 tev ) neutralinos , with a relic abundance consistent with the wmap 5 dark matter bounds  @xcite , and which provide a unified explanation of the pamela and atic observations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we summarize the observations by pamela / atic experiments in section ii and review their implications in the context of dark matter decays or annihilations in section iii . in section",
    "iv an estimate of neutrino flux expected from the annihilating and decaying neutralino scenarios is provided .",
    "section v discusses how the cmssm could be supplemented by new physics while preserving the neutralino cold dark matter framework .",
    "we outline in section  [ constraints_section ] the procedure that we use to scan the cmssm parameter space and the various experimental bounds that we take into account . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present plots displaying the relevant cmssm parameter space and highlight in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] a few benchmark points that are consistent with the pamela and atic measurements .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the spectra of cosmic ray electrons and positrons should have contributions from known sources including @xmath5 accelerated in supernova remnants and @xmath6 from collisions between cosmic rays and interstellar protons  @xcite .",
    "besides well known guaranteed backgrounds , any evidence for an additional component may carry indications of a new phenomon .",
    "recently , the pamela  @xcite and atic  @xcite experiments have observed cosmic ray positrons and/or electrons within the energy range from several gev up to a few tev , and provided new hints for the long suspected excess in their fluxes  @xcite with respect to the model expectations  @xcite .",
    "the revitalized interest in this long standing puzzle has recently generated much interest in finding both astrophysical and perhaps more exotic explanations .",
    "the atic experiment has measured the combined electron and positron flux from @xmath730  gev reaching energies up to several tev as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the primary electron spectrum is based on calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite ( light shaded ) is also shown .",
    "as the normalization of the primary electron spectrum is already quite uncertain , we renormalize this down by a factor @xmath8 in order to match the low energy part of the atic data .",
    "unlike electrons , while there are no primary sources of positrons in this model ( see also  @xcite ) , the expected secondary positron spectrum mainly due to cosmic ray interactions ( dark shaded ) is also presented .",
    "there is also a much smaller secondary electron component ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the pamela data is originally reported as the positron fraction of total electron / positron flux up to @xmath9  gev  @xcite . in order to show both electron and positron data on the same figure",
    ", we have converted the reported ratios into absolute flux units using the primary electron spectrum .",
    "as shown in the figure , the corresponding positron flux based on the pamela data suggests a strong deviation from the secondary positron background .",
    "while the measurements by pamela below @xmath710  gev might depend on solar modulation effects , the excess in the positron flux measurements with respect to the model expectations is evident at higher energies .",
    "pairs with spectra @xmath10 gev@xmath11m@xmath12s@xmath11sr@xmath13 with a cut - off around @xmath14  gev ( solid line ) can provide a better fit to both atic ( dashed lined ) and pamela ( dot dashed line ) measurements .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in order to understand the unexpectedly high electronic flux observed by pamela and atic the cmssm must be supplemented by new physics . if one wishes to preserve the basic neutralino cold dark matter framework , which we propose to do in this paper , at least two options are available .",
    "perhaps the simplest modification one could contemplate is to include r - parity violating superpotential coupling(s ) with suitably tiny dimensionless coefficient(s ) , such that the neutralino primarily decays into leptons , with lifetime @xmath15 .",
    "a simple example is provided by the coupling @xmath16   @xcite , which leads to 3-body leptonic decays of the neutralino .",
    "this modification has an important advantage in that it preserves the basic structure of the cmssm , especially by leaving intact the standard calculations for estimating the relic neutralino abundance .",
    "the implications for cmssm spectroscopy for this case which has a rather heavy neutralino ( @xmath17 ) are discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "dark matter neutralinos annihilating in the halos of galaxies provide an exciting new source for cosmic rays including positrons .",
    "to explain the pamela and atic observations in terms of neutralino annihilations , the cmssm must be supplemented by new physics which should accomplish the following three things : allow neutralino annihilations primarily into leptonic channels , produce a boost factor of order @xmath18 or so through sommerfeld enhancement  @xcite , and last but by no means",
    "least , ensure that the relic abundance of neutralinos is consistent with wmap bounds . several interesting proposals for annihilating wimps that explain pamela and atic have been put forward  @xcite . however",
    ", it is not obvious if they can be easily adapted to the cmssm scenario we are considering in which the neutralino makes up the observed cold dark matter in the universe . thus , even though an explicit particle physics construction for neutralino annihilation satisfying the above conditions is not yet available , we will in the following discussion present spectroscopy results which cover a wide range of neutralino masses currently favored by pamela and atic , including the 700 gev or so value motivated from neutralino annihilation .",
    "we employ isajet  7.78 package  @xcite to perform random scans over the parameter space . in this package , the weak scale values of gauge and third generation yukawa couplings",
    "are evolved to @xmath19 via the mssm renormalization group equations ( rges ) in the @xmath20 regularization scheme , where @xmath19 is defined to be the scale at which @xmath21 .",
    "we do not enforce an exact unification of the strong coupling @xmath22 at @xmath19 , since a few percent deviation from unification can be assigned to unknown gut - scale threshold corrections  @xcite . at @xmath19 ,",
    "the cmssm boundary conditions are imposed and all the ssb parameters , along with the gauge and yukawa couplings , are evolved back to the weak scale @xmath23 . in the evaluation of yukawa couplings",
    "the susy threshold corrections  @xcite are taken into account at the common scale @xmath24 .",
    "the entire parameter set is iteratively run between @xmath23 and @xmath19 using the full 2-loop rges until a stable solution is obtained .",
    "to better account for leading - log corrections , one - loop step - beta functions are adopted for gauge and yukawa couplings , and the ssb parameters @xmath25 are extracted from rges at multiple scales @xmath26 .",
    "the rge - improved 1-loop effective potential is minimized at an optimized scale @xmath27 , which effectively accounts for the leading 2-loop corrections .",
    "full 1-loop radiative corrections are incorporated for all sparticle masses .",
    "the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb )  @xcite puts an important theoretical constraint on the parameter space .",
    "another important constraint comes from limits on the cosmological abundance of stable charged particles  @xcite .",
    "this excludes regions in the parameter space where charged susy particles , such as @xmath28 or @xmath29 , become the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "we accept only those solutions for which the neutralino is the lsp .",
    "we have performed random scans for the following parameter range : @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and @xmath32  gev @xcite .    after collecting the data",
    ", we use the isatools package  @xcite to implement the following phenomenological constraints :    @xmath33 @xcite ,    @xmath34 @xcite ,    @xmath35 @xcite ,    @xmath36 @xcite ,    @xmath37 @xcite ,    @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we have applied the constraints from experimental data successively on the data that we acquired from isajet . as a first step",
    "we apply the constraints from @xmath39 , @xmath40 , chargino mass , and higgs mass .",
    "we then apply the wmap upper bound on the relic density of cold dark matter followed by the constraint on the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath41 at the @xmath42 allowed region .",
    "finally , we apply the lower bound on the dark matter relic abundance . the data is then plotted showing the successive application of each of these constraints .",
    "pamela and atic , as discussed previously , have set constraints on the mass and other properties of the dark matter candidate which , in our cmssm case , is the neutralino .",
    "the preferred mass values are as follows :    * @xmath43 : this region is interesting if we wish to explain the pamela results based on decaying neutralinos . *",
    "@xmath44 : this relatively narrow range of neutralino mass explains the results from both pamela and atic based on decaying neutralinos . * @xmath45 : this region of neutralino masses can explain the pamela observation if we assume that neutralinos annihilate , rather than decay , preferentially into electrons and positrons .",
    "* @xmath46 : this region can explain the results from both pamela and atic based on annihilating neutralinos .",
    "we now present the results of the random scan focusing attention on the above mentioned neutralino mass ranges . in fig .",
    "[ fund1 ] we plot the results in the @xmath47 and ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) planes for @xmath50 ( left panel ) and @xmath51 ( right panel ) .",
    "all of these points satisfy the theoretical requirement of rewsb and correspond to a neutralino with mass less than @xmath52 tev .",
    "in addition , these points satisfy the various experimental constraints listed earlier .",
    "gray points satisfy the constraints from @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the higgs and chargino masses . after application of the wmap 5 upper bound on neutralino dark matter ( light blue points ) ,",
    "the allowed region is drastically shrunk , with the remaining gray points associated with an unacceptably high dark matter relic density .",
    "the other colors ( green , red , dark blue and black ) in fig .",
    "[ fund1 ] correspond to different ranges of neutralino mass such that the neutralino satisfies both the wmap 5 upper and lower bounds on dark matter relic abundance .",

    "these are ;    * green points correspond to @xmath53 .",
    "* black points correspond to @xmath54 .",
    "* red points correspond to @xmath55 .",
    "note that if we want to explain just the pamela data through neutralino annihilation with a suitable ` boost ' factor , there is almost no constraint on the cmssm parameter space as it requires in this case @xmath45 , which is satisfied by almost all cmssm allowed points .",
    "the ( @xmath48 , @xmath56 ) plane for @xmath50 is distinctly different from that of @xmath51 . with @xmath51 , the ratio between @xmath48 and @xmath57",

    "to simultaneously explain both pamela and atic using a decaying neutralino requires a very heavy sparticle spectrum in the cmssm , and the only particle that can be observed relatively easily at the lhc is the lightest higgs boson .",
    "if we focus our attention on explaining only the pamela results ( @xmath72 ) , we obtain a sparticle spectrum that is much more accessible at the lhc .",

    "[ spar1 ] in this case we can find a relatively light chargino ( @xmath73 ) and cp - odd and charged higgs with masses @xmath74 .    while we do not currently have a nice theoretical model for neutralino annihilations within the framework of cmssm , it is plausible that such a model may be constructed in the future . if we allow for this possibility , it makes sense to explain atic and pamela in terms of neutralino annihilations and study the corresponding cmssm sparticle spectroscopy .",
    "the advantage here is that we need a significantly lighter neutralino to explain the atic and pamela observations , and the corresponding spectroscopy is much more exciting from the point of view of the lhc .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] ( table  [ table2 ] ) we present a few representative points for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "all of these points correspond to a bino - like neutralino and have been chosen such that :    * point 1 may be used to explain pamela based on either decaying or annihilating neutralinos .",
    "* point 2 may be used to explain both atic and pamela based on annihilating neutralinos .",
    "* point 3 may be used to explain both atic and pamela based on decaying neutralinos .",
    "we also calculate for each benchmark point the neutralino - nucleon cross section . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the cross sections corresponding to the benchmark points 1 and 2 are a few orders of magnitude smaller then the exclusion limits set by the current experiments for direct dark matter detection such as cdms @xcite and xenon10 @xcite .",
    "the cross sections in the case of @xmath51 are smaller still .",
    "we have explored the implications for higgs and sparticle spectroscopy of the cmssm model in the light of recent cosmic ray observations reported by the pamela and atic experiments .",
    "our investigation is based on the premise that the lightest cmssm neutralino comprises the dark matter in the universe , and that the underlying physics should provide a unified explanation , either through neutralino self annihilation or via its decay , for the positron and electron - positron excess reported by these two experiments .",
    "we have identified some benchmark points in the cmssm parameter space which are consistent with this unified explanation .",
    "the corresponding sparticle mass spectra turns out , as expected , to be relatively heavy .",
    "the outlook for new particle discovery at the lhc is considerably enhanced if the atic data is simply ignored . in one example based on the decaying neutralino scenario ,",
    "we find a relatively light chargino ( @xmath75 gev ) and cp - odd and charged higgs with masses @xmath76 gev .",
