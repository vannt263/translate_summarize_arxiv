    "in ionizing ion atom collisions the emitted electrons typically show a continuous energy distribution with decreasing intensity towards higher energies . the dominant contribution to the electron energy distribution results mainly from distant collisions with small energy transfers which can be approximated by an exponential decay @xcite .",
    "recently we showed for he@xmath5/ne@xmath0 collisions @xcite that for van der waals dimers there is a significant increase of low energy electrons on top of the distribution for atomic targets .",
    "such low energy electrons have been shown to efficiently cause double strand breaks in dna @xcite .",
    "we could trace this enhanced production of low energy electrons back to an autoionization mechanism termed interatomic coulombic decay ( icd ) . in icd an excited target atom ( e.g. by the removal of a 2s - electron in neon ) relaxes into the ground state by transferring its excess energy to another neutral atom where a low energy ( icd ) electron is emitted .",
    "in contrast to isolated excited atoms in which radiative decay occurs on a long time scale the icd channel is open when the excited atom is located in close vicinity to other atoms .",
    "icd has therefore been suggested to be a relevant mechanism in causing radiation damage to healthy tissue . in return icd",
    "was also proposed to be utilized in radiation therapy by specifically triggering it in the proximity of tumor cells via resonant auger decay @xcite .",
    "icd was predicted in 1997 by cederbaum et al . @xcite and",
    "experimentally confirmed in 2003 by marburger et al .",
    "@xcite for neon clusters and in 2004 for neon dimers by jahnke et al",
    ". @xcite . today",
    "`` it is now well - known that icd appears everywhere and transfers the energy and the charge from the species with the vacancy to the environment surrounding it . ''",
    "this statement refers to the divers experimental and theoretical studies on icd occurring in many systems .",
    "it has been observed or predicted for extremely large quantum objects as the helium dimer @xcite , biologically relevant aqueous systems such as water clusters @xcite and liquid water @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , surfaces @xcite and a vast number of rare gas clusters @xcite ( see recent reviews and references therein @xcite ) .",
    "these works differ in the chosen `` target system '' but also in the way the excitation is created experimentally . the most common route to create the excitation is by an initial valence or inner - shell photoionization by synchrotron radiation but also resonant excitation or ,",
    "as was shown very recently , resonant auger excitation of the target @xcite has proven to initiate icd .",
    "there are also two very recent studies in which icd was observed after ion impact @xcite . in the present work we give a comprehensive overview of the observation of icd ( and its significant contribution to the low energy electron yield ) in ion / dimer collisions for he@xmath2 and he@xmath3 projectiles at energies from the maximum of the stopping power of liquid water ( v @xmath6 2.5 a.u . )",
    "@xcite up to very fast ( v = 21.2 a.u . and",
    "q / v = 0.66 ) s@xmath1 projectiles where the momentum transfer between the projectile and the target system is small @xcite .",
    "we observe multiple breakup channels for collisions with and without change of the projectile charge state in neon and argon dimers .",
    "the change of the projectile charge state @xmath7q@xmath8 = q@xmath9 - q@xmath10 is one way to categorize the reaction , with q@xmath9 being the initial and q@xmath10 the final projectile charge state .",
    "the processes are referred to as ionization i ( @xmath7q@xmath8 = 0 ) , projectile loss pl ( @xmath7q@xmath8 = -1 ) , single capture sc ( @xmath7q@xmath8 = 1 ) and double capture dc ( @xmath7q@xmath8 = 2 ) .",
    "we used a coltrims @xcite reaction microscope to measure the momenta of the fragments ( see table [ configuration ] for experimental parameters ) . the projectile ion beam and the target gas jet",
    "are intersected at an angle of 90 degrees forming an interaction region of a few mm@xmath11 .",
    "the electrons and ions created in the collision are guided by a weak homogeneous magnetic and electric field onto time- and position - sensitive channel - plate detectors with delay - line readout ( psd ) @xcite .",
    "the particles are collected with a 4 @xmath12 solid angle for the displayed energy ranges . due to an electron detection efficiency of less than 0.4",
    "the number of detected events decreases with a scaling factor of at least 0.4@xmath13 ( n : number of electrons ) . in the data analysis",
    "we therefore consider both ions and one of the emitted electrons .",
    "for the ionization channel without charge exchange the projectile could not be detected and a pulsed ion beam was used to measure the times - of - flight . for those channels where the projectile changed its charge state",
    "a continuous ion beam was used and the projectile was charge state analyzed by an electrostatic deflector and detected on a third psd .",
    "this delivered a stop signal for the time - of - flight measurement .",
    "the three - dimensional momentum vectors and therewith the kinetic energies of the particles are reconstructed from the particles times - of - flight and positions of impact on the detector . the precooled",
    "( t@xmath14 = 150 - 300 k ) target gas is further cooled in a supersonic gas expansion through a nozzle ( d@xmath15 = 5 - 30 @xmath16 m ) at a driving pressure p@xmath14 of a few bar .",
    "two skimmers ( < 0.5 mm ) reduce the gas jet diameter to 1 - 1.5 mm at the interaction region . depending on the particular experimental parameters a dimer to monomer fraction of approximately 1%",
    "is estimated .",
    "the projectiles with an energy of e@xmath17 = 11.37 mev / u and a relative energy spread of approximately 10@xmath18 were delivered by the heavy ion accelerator facility `` ganil '' ( caen , france ) at the intermediate energy beamline `` sme '' in cave d at intervals of 81.2 ns .",
    "the projectiles were provided in bunches of 2 mm in diameter .",
    "the bunch length at the target position is about 1 ns . this is not deteriorated by the energy spread of the beam , since there is an active time focusing unit in the beamline which compensates for this spread in time due to the velocity spread .",
    "the electron times - of - flight are typically in the order of a few ten nanoseconds ( 20 - 50 ns ) and with that smaller than the bunch period .",
    "the ion times - of - flight ( 1 - 10 @xmath16s ) are thus unambiguously determined in an electron - ion - bunchmarker coincidence .",
    "the helium projectile ions at `` low '' energy were generated by the van de graaff accelerator at the institut fr kernphysik of the goethe - universitt in frankfurt as described in @xcite for the ionization experiment and as described in @xcite for the experiments with projectile charge state change .",
    "the typical recoil momenta of the ions in such collisions are below 2 a.u .",
    "@xcite and thus can be neglected compared to the momenta gained in the coulomb explosion ( up to 200 a.u . ) .",
    ".the configuration for the extraction fields and the parameters for the target gas jet are given for each projectile and target gas whereby t@xmath14 is the temperature of the precooled gas , p@xmath14 the driving pressure and d the diameter of the nozzle . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the neon dimer is considered a model system for icd .",
    "numerous theoretical and experimental works @xcite have been performed .",
    "experimentally icd like mechanisms which lead to the fragmentation channels ne@xmath2/ne@xmath2 and ne@xmath3/ne@xmath2 have been identified after irradiation by synchrotron light .",
    "these are also found in nearly all collision systems studied here .",
    "in addition we find fragmentation into ne@xmath19/ne@xmath2 , which was up to now not mentioned in the literature .",
    "the above described `` model icd mechanism '' is the main contributor to the low energy electrons seen in fig .",
    "[ ee]a - 2d and fig .",
    "[ ee]g with the neon dimer fragmenting into ne@xmath2/ne@xmath2 .",
    "it can thus be seen that icd prominently appears in all relevant channels in ion / dimer collisions .",
    "these include pure ionization ( a ) , projectile electron loss ( b ) and electron transfer ( c ) , the latter is triggered by a he@xmath2 projectile .",
    "qualitatively this behavior is unchanged for the single electron transfer process to the doubly charged projectile he@xmath3 given by ( g ) .",
    "the only collision system studied in this work which does not exhibit icd is the double electron transfer to the he@xmath20 projectiles with ne@xmath2/ne@xmath2 breakup for reasons of charge conservation .",
    "we note that the additional low energy electron contribution for fast ( v = 21.2 a.u . ) , highly charged s@xmath1 projectiles ( d ) is clearly visible but substantially reduced compared to ( a ) .",
    "[ comparison ] shows for channel ( d ) the projection of the electron energies for the two regions in the kinetic energy release 3.5 ev <  e@xmath21 <  5.5 ev ( blue up - pointing triangles ) and 5.5 ev <  e@xmath21 <  8 ev ( green down - pointing triangles ) . for comparison the electron energy distributions for singly ionized neon atoms ( black squares ) and doubly ionized neon atoms ( red circles ) are depicted .",
    "all curves are scaled to the leftmost data point of the singly ionized monomers .",
    "it can be seen that the electron energy distribution for 5.5 ev <  e@xmath21 <  8 ev , where the rct process is initiated by the double ionization of one atomic center of the dimer , shows a similar decay behavior as the electron energy distribution of the doubly ionized monomers .",
    "the electron energy distribution for the range in the kinetic energy release 3.5 ev <  e@xmath21 <  5.5 ev which is populated by single ionization processes followed by ce and icd exhibits a significantly less steeper decay than the electrons that stem from the singly ionized monomers .",
    "this discrepancy might be caused by the dominant contribution of 2s - electrons which are emitted in the icd process .",
    "the low energy electrons in the breakup channels given by ne@xmath3/ne@xmath2 ion pairs are attributed predominantly to two icd mechanisms which were suggested by santra et al .",
    "@xcite and demekhin et al .",
    "@xcite and observed by kreidi et al .",

    "a 2p - electron from the doubly charged ion fills the 2s - hole where the excitation energy is transferred to the neighbor by a virtual photon .",
    "there a 2p - electron is removed leading to the dimer state ne@xmath3(2p@xmath25)[@xmath23d]/ne@xmath2(2p@xmath26)[@xmath27p ] .",
    "this process termed `` direct icd '' exhibits a sum energy of e@xmath28 = e@xmath21 + e@xmath29 = 11.1 ev and occurs at distances around the equilibrium bond length of the neutral neon dimer . in the second scenario ,",
    "an electron of the neutral atom fills the 2s - hole of the doubly charged ion where simultaneously a second 2p - electron of the same site is ionized by the released excess energy .",
    "this `` electron exchange '' icd , which ends in the final state ne@xmath3(2p@xmath25)[@xmath23p]/ne@xmath2(2p@xmath26)[@xmath27p ] , has been reported to depend strongly on the spatial overlap of the wavefunctions @xcite .",

    "low energy electrons distributed along these lines clearly show ic decay mechanisms leading to ne@xmath3/ne@xmath2 after ion impact .",
