    "substitution dynamical systems are widely used as toy models for aperiodic order in one dimension  @xcite . the binary rudin ",
    "shapiro sequence   is a paradigm for a substitution - based structure with ( in its balanced weight case ) purely absolutely continuous diffraction spectrum ; we refer to  @xcite for details and background .",
    "indeed , this deterministic sequence has the stronger property that its two - point correlations vanish for _ any _ non - zero distance , as it would be the case for a random sequence @xcite .",
    "while currently only very few examples of substitution - based sequences with this property are known , a systematic generalisation in terms of hadamard matrices @xcite allows the construction of one - dimensional as well as higher - dimensional examples .",
    "we start by reviewing rudin s original construction  @xcite , and modify it to obtain a new example of a substitution - based structure with absolutely continuous diffraction spectrum .",
    "our approach differs from the construction in  @xcite .",
    "we then use recent work of bartlett  @xcite to investigate the properties of the new system in more detail .",
    "in 1958 , salem  @xcite asked the following question : is it possible to find a sequence @xmath0 such that there is a constant @xmath1 for which @xmath2 holds for any positive integer @xmath3 ?",
    "this is known as the ` root @xmath3 ' property , which implies absolutely continuous diffraction of the sequence @xmath4 by an application of ( * ? ? ?",
    "rudin  @xcite and shapiro  @xcite independently gave positive answers to the question by constructing what is now known as the rudin ",
    "shapiro sequence .",
    "we briefly review rudin s original construction to obtain the substitution dynamical system and its balanced weight version ( with weights in @xmath5 ) .",
    "we start by defining polynomials @xmath6 and @xmath7 of degree @xmath8 for @xmath9 recursively by @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "note that from eq .",
    "it is clear that the first @xmath12 terms of @xmath13 and of @xmath14 coincide with those of @xmath6 , and the remaining terms differ by a sign . by construction",
    ", @xmath6 is of the form @xmath15 so we can define a binary sequence @xmath16 from the corresponding coefficients .",
    "this is the binary rudin  shapiro sequence .",
    "for example , @xmath17 , from which we read off the sequence @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "the main ingredient in the proof of property for this sequence is the parallelogram law , @xmath20 for @xmath21 ; see  @xcite for details .",
    "this can be used to establish the bound on @xmath22 .    often , the rudin ",
    "shapiro sequence is defined by a four - letter substitution rule and a subsequent reduction map from four to two letters .",
    "the underlying four - letter substitution on the alphabet @xmath23 can be read off from the recursion , noting that the recursion implies the concatenation of the sequences corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "associating letters @xmath26 and @xmath27 to the coefficients in @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the letters @xmath30 and @xmath31 to those of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , this gives rise to the four - letter substitution rule @xmath34 which corresponds to the standard four - letter rudin  shapiro subsitution .",
    "iterating the sequence on the initial seed @xmath26 gives @xmath35 which , under the mapping @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( which corresponds to the choice of signs above ) produces the binary rudin ",
    "shapiro sequence @xmath40 .",
    "let us now modify rudin s original argument by considering the following system @xmath41 starting again from @xmath11 .",
    "since from now on we shall only look at this set of recursion relations , we use the same notation as above . what has changed in comparison with eq .",
    "is that we swap the sign in the recursion relation in each step .",
    "since the sign does not affect the argument used in rudin s proof @xcite , it is straightforward to show that the parallelogram law can again be used to prove that the corresponding _ new _ sequence of coefficients @xmath40 , defined as above via eq .  , also satisfies the root @xmath3 property .",
    "can we read off the corresponding substitution rule as for the rudin ",
    "shapiro case ?",
    "indeed this is possible , but it is slightly more complicated , because the recursion relations in eq .",
    "one way to deal with that is to look at two consecutive steps together , @xmath42 choosing @xmath43 to be even , say , and associating again four letters @xmath44 to the sequences corresponding to @xmath45 , we can read off the substitution @xmath46 which is now a constant length substitution of length four , because we used a double step of the recursion . therefore eq",
    ".   corresponds to concatenation of four sets of coefficients .",
    "as before , the binary sequence is obtained from iterating the substitution on the initial letter @xmath26 ; @xmath47 by mapping @xmath26 and @xmath27 to @xmath48 and mapping @xmath30 and @xmath31 to @xmath19 , we obtain @xmath49 as the initial part of our new binary sequence .    clearly , we can generate infinitely many such examples by changing the signs in the original recursion relation in more complicated ways .",
    "any finite sequence of signs , when used periodically , will give rise to a substitution - based system .",
    "however , the length of the substitution will increase with the length of the sign sequence .",
    "there neither appears to be an obvious relation between the different rudin ",
    "shapiro type sequences obtained from this construction , nor between these sequences and those derived from frank s construction @xcite . in the latter case , the number of letters in the alphabet increases with the size of the hadamard matrix , whereas all our sequences will only use four letters . having said that , it would be possible to use more letters rather than consider multiple recursion steps , so the relation between these two approaches still needs to be analysed in more detail .",
    "since we have rudin s original argument at our disposal , we know that this new binary sequence satisfies the root @xmath3 property , and hence has ( in the balanced weight case with weights @xmath5 ) purely absolutely continuous diffraction .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to use the remainder of this paper to apply bartlett s algorithm @xcite to our new ( four - letter substitution ) sequence , and to verify that ( in the balanced weight case ) it indeed has absolutely continuous diffraction spectrum only . due to space constraints",
    ", we can not introduce all quantities here , and instead refer to @xcite for definitions and further details .",
    "the balanced weight sequence derived from the substitution rule @xmath50 of eq .",
    "has purely absolutely continuous diffraction spectrum .    the four instruction matrices @xmath51 and the substitution matrix @xmath52 can be read off of the substitution rule .",
    "they are given by @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "as @xmath55 has positive entries only , the substitution is primitive .",
    "the second iterate of the seed @xmath26 obtained in eq",
    ".   shows that the letter @xmath26 can be preceded by either @xmath27 or @xmath30 .",
    "hence @xmath26 has two distinct neighbourhoods and , by pansiot s lemma  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.6 ) , the substitution is aperiodic .    since we are dealing with a constant - length substitution , the leading ( perron  frobenius ) eigenvalue ( * ? ?",
    "2.2 ) of @xmath52 is @xmath56 with ( statistically normalised ) eigenvector and @xmath57 . by applying  ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.3 ) , we obtain @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the unit vector corresponding to the word @xmath60 . as @xmath50 is a length four substitution",
    ", we have @xmath61 . using  ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.3 ) , we find @xmath62 and @xmath63 one can then verify the following recursive relations @xmath64 using  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.2 ) , we calculate the ergodic decomposition of the bi - substitution @xmath65 , and obtain @xmath66 and @xmath67 as the two ergodic classes and @xmath68 as the transient part . from",
    "4.7 ) , it then follows that @xmath69 diagonalising the matrix @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 setting @xmath72 , strong semi - positivity is equivalent to @xmath73 satisfying @xmath74 .",
    "the extreme points are then given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "thus the extreme rays are @xmath77 as usual , @xmath78 , which gives rise to the pure point component of the spectrum . using eq .  , one checks that @xmath79 for all @xmath80 , which gives us the absolutely continuous component .",
    "thus , we have a purely absolute continuous spectrum in the balanced weight case , in which the pure point component is extinguished .",
    "the authors would like to thank ian short for many helpful comments .",
    "l.c .  would like to thank the organising committee for a young scientist award to attend icq13 in kathmandu ."
