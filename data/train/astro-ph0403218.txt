    "modern large - scale accurate photometric surveys offer an unprecedented view of stellar populations . here",
    "we discuss a population of unresolved binary stars which account for fewer than 10@xmath3 of stars detected by the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) . despite this low occurance frequency",
    ", the sample presented here is sufficiently large ( @xmath21000 stars ) to characterize their broad - band optical properties .      the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; abazajian et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) is revolutionizing stellar astronomy by providing homogeneous and deep ( @xmath4 ) photometry in five passbands ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1996 , gunn et al .",
    "1998 , hogg et al .",
    "2001 , smith et al .",
    "2002 ) , accurate to 0.02 mag ( ivezi et al .",
    "ultimately , up to 10,000 deg@xmath10 of sky in the northern galactic cap will be surveyed .",
    "the survey sky coverage will result in photometric measurements for over 100 million stars and a similar number of galaxies .",
    "astrometric positions are accurate to better than 0.1 arcsec per coordinate ( rms ) for point sources with @xmath11 ( pier et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the morphological information from the images allows robust star - galaxy separation to @xmath12 21.5@xmath13 ( lupton et al .",
    "2003 ) .    here",
    "we report the results of a color - based search for binary stars in the recent sdss data release 1 ( see www.sdss.org ) , which includes 53 million unique objects detected in 2099 deg@xmath10 of sky .",
    "the effective temperature is the dominant parameter that determines the position of the majority of stars in optical color - color diagrams constructed with broad - band filters ( lenz et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "the effective temperature range results in a well - defined stellar locus in color - color diagrams ( for more details see finlator et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "an unresolved binary star may have colors that place it either inside or outside the locus .",
    "if the luminosity of one star is much greater than that of the other , the more luminous star determines the system colors .",
    "however , even if the luminosities are comparable , the system color may still fall close to the locus of single stars in color - color diagrams where the locus resembles a straight line ( e.g. the  vs.  diagram ) .",
    "thus , to select unresolved binary systems by their colors , the most promising diagrams are those where the locus is curved , such as the  vs.  and  vs.  color - color diagrams .",
    "the curvature in these diagrams is the result of saturation of the  and  colors due to the strong molecular absorption bands which first appear at type @xmath2m0 .",
    "figure 1 shows the  vs.  color - color diagram for @xmath21.99 million stars from the public sdss data release 1 ( dr1 ) database with @xmath14 .",
    "this magnitude limit ensures that the accuracy of the @xmath5 magnitudes is better than 0.1 mag ( for @xmath15 , the photometric accuracy is 0.02 mag , ivezi et al .",
    "the most prominent feature is the main stellar locus . due to the large number of stars in dr1",
    ", we are able to demonstrate the existence of a second stellar locus , clearly visible just above the main stellar locus .",
    "the number of stars in this , previously unreported feature , is a factor of @xmath22,300 smaller than in the main locus ( using color cuts listed in the next section ) .",
    "thus , accurate multi - band photometry ( @xmath5 band in particular ) for a sufficiently large number of stars was required to detect such a low - contrast feature .",
    "the second stellar locus is consistent with binary systems than include an m dwarf and a white dwarf .",
    "we demonstrate that this simple model provides a satisfactory explanation for the position of the second stellar locus , hereafter the `` bridge '' ( from m dwarfs to white dwarfs ) .",
    "we also show that the available sdss spectra for a subsample of bridge stars support this interpretation .",
    "the bridge of stars in the  vs.  color - color diagram appears to connect the positions of m stars and hot blue stars , with mk spectral type around @xmath16 . in order to produce a locus of stars that is not coincident with the main stellar locus",
    ", the luminosities of the two components must be comparable .",
    "the possibilities are an m dwarf  white dwarf pair , or an m giant  blue giant / supergiant pair .",
    "the latter systems can not dominate the sample because the sky density of the selected stars ( 0.40 deg@xmath17 ) is too high , given the faint magnitudes and high latitudes probed by sdss ( see majewski et al .",
    "2004 for a nearly complete census of m giants in the galaxy ) .",
    "we generate model colors for binary systems by assuming sdss colors for single m dwarf and white dwarf stars , and parametrize the system colors by the luminosity ratio of the two components ( in practice , we use the @xmath7 band flux fractions ) . for the m dwarf",
    "we adopt @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 to 0.75 , with a step of 0.05 , and for the white dwarf @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 . for more details about m dwarfs and white dwarfs discovered by sdss",

    "( 2003 ) , raymond et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and kleinman et al .",
    "the model predictions are compared to the data in figure 2 , where the dots represent 863 `` dr1 bridge stars '' , selected by requiring @xmath26 , @xmath272 , @xmath280.3 , @xmath29 , and that processing flags bright , satur and blended are not set ( the flag requirement selects unique unsaturated objects , see abazajian et al .",
    "we corrected all colors for the interstellar reddening using the maps from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) ; typical corrections at the high galactic latitudes considered here are @xmath30 mag .",
    "the agreement between this simple binary star model and the data is satisfactory . in particular",
    ", the model track closely follows the distribution of bridge stars in the  vs.  color - color diagram , and reproduces the observed range of colors in other diagrams .",
    "a noteworthy point is that the implied contribution of the white dwarf to the total @xmath7 band flux is at most 50% for practically all stars from the `` dr1 bridge '' sample ( for equal @xmath7 band flux contributions , the model predicts @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "while the close agreement between the data and model predictions supports the hypothesis that the bridge stars are dominated by m dwarf  white dwarf pairs , further confirmation can be gained by examining the available sdss spectra .",
    "stars are selected by various criteria for sdss spectroscopic observations , and we postpone a detailed analysis of the selection statistics to a forthcoming publication . here",
    "we simply report the results of a visual examination of 47 `` bridge '' stars from the dr1 sample for which sdss spectra are available .",
    "the spectra are obtained through 3@xmath33 fibers , and span the wavelength range 38009200 , with a spectral resolution of @xmath34 .",
    "out of 863 stars in the sample , spectra are available for 47 .",
    "the visual inspection of spectra indicates that 45 are consistent with an m dwarf  white dwarf interpretation ( the remaining 2 are g stars ; both are close to the color - selection boundary , and one belongs to a complex blended source ) .",
    "we display a representative sample of spectra in figure 3 .",
    "a preliminary comparison with the m dwarf spectral sequence ( hawley et al . 2002 ) indicates that m dwarfs in the binary systems discussed here are dominated by types m5 and earlier , as is the case for single m dwarfs in this magnitude - limited sample .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the distribution of their  and   colors ( the median  color is @xmath21.0 , see the lower left panel in figure 2 ) .",
    "we visually compared all spectra to the atlas of white dwarf spectra by wesemael et al .",
    "about half belong to the da class , and about one third can be tentatively classified as subdwarfs .",
    "other classes that are probably present in the sample include db , dz and dq .",
    "we note that sdss spectra are of sufficient quality to allow determination of the white dwarf temperature and the m dwarf chromospheric activity ( via h@xmath35 emission ) , as demonstrated by raymond et al .",
    "such an analysis will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the models discussed in section 3 indicate that the white dwarf contribution to the  and  band fluxes is practically negligible .",
    "hence , the absolute  band magnitude for the m dwarf component , @xmath36 , and therefore distances , can be obtained using the @xmath36 vs.  color - magnitude relation from hawley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . with an estimate for distance",
    ", the absolute @xmath5 band magnitude for the white dwarf component can be determined , and compared to model cooling curves .",
    "two additional parameters that can be derived from the data are the @xmath1 color for the white dwarf component , and the components @xmath7 band flux ( or luminosity ) ratio . in this analysis",
    ", we further constrain the sources to be very close ( 0.15 mag ) to the `` bridge '' by requiring @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    using this approach",
    "we find a median @xmath41 for the m dwarf component , with a root - mean - scatter of 1 mag .",
    "the corresponding median distance is @xmath2400 pc .",
    "the derived white dwarf parameters are compared to models by bergeron et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in fig .",
    "as shown in the top right panel , the estimated white dwarf colors agree well with the model predictions .",
    "similarly , fairly good agreement is obtained for the luminosity  color distribution displayed in the bottom left panel . models with 7@xmath27log(g)@xmath278.5 bracket the majority of data points , in agreement with the analysis of isolated white dwarfs with sdss spectra ( kleinman et al .",
    "about 20% of data points have @xmath1 color , for a given absolute magnitude , too red by about 0.5 mag ( or equivalently , for a given @xmath1 color , absolute magnitude is too bright by @xmath22 mag ) .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to sample contamination by other types of source .",
    "the white dwarf absolute magnitude  distance distribution is shown in the bottom right panel .",
    "since the sample presented here is an unbiased , @xmath5 flux - limited sample ( with the adopted @xmath5 magnitude limit , the other four sdss magnitudes for all stars in the sample are comfortably brighter than the corresponding sdss completeness limits ) , it would be straightforward to determine the white dwarf luminosity function and the number density ( assuming that the components are not strongly interacting ) .",
    "however , the unresolved binary stars discussed here are heavily biased towards systems with components that have similar luminosities , and it is not trivial to account for this effect .",
    "such a detailed analysis of m dwarf and white dwarf luminosity functions in unresolved binary systems will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the accurate multi - band sdss photometry for a large number of stars allowed detection of a new feature in the broad - band optical color - color diagrams : a `` bridge '' of stars , well - separated from the main stellar locus , connects the positions of m dwarfs and white dwarfs .",
    "the bridge characteristics are consistent with a binary system than includes an m dwarf and a white dwarf , with the system s position on the bridge determined by the components luminosity ratio .",
    "this conclusion is strongly supported by sdss spectra for 47 such systems .",
    "the distance to these systems can be estimated in a straightforward way because a photometric parallax relation for m dwarfs can be applied to @xmath8 and @xmath9 band measurements , where the contribution from the white dwarf is negligible . with a known system distance , the white dwarf",
    "luminosity - color distributions can be determined and compared to models .",
    "we find that models by bergeron et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are in good agreement with the data .",
    "this work analyzed only about a quarter of the data that will be obtained by the sdss .",
    "thus , the color selection method presented here will eventually yield @xmath24,000 unresolved m dwarf white dwarf binary systems .",
