    "it is known that the results of perturbative calculations of the physical quantities , which obey the rg equations ( for the development of the rg method see e.g. @xcite ) , depend on the choice of the scale and scheme of the renormalization procedure . in the case of qcd",
    "this problem is of particular importance .",
    "indeed , calculations of the multiloop corrections to the observable physical quantities and to the related rg- functions ( namely , @xmath1-function and various anomalous dimensions ) are usually performed in the class of minimal subtractions ( ms ) schemes , and in the -scheme @xcite , in particular . in this case ,",
    "an error of the comparison of theoretical results with experimental data is usually determined by varying the corresponding renormalization scale @xmath7 within the concrete interval , say @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the conventionally chosen number , i.e. @xmath10 ( this convention was recently used recently in @xcite ) . as can be seen from this work and from the studies of heavy flavour contributions to dis sum rules @xcite",
    ", this interval for @xmath9 is indeed conventional .",
    "say , the analysis of @xcite motivates the choice of the following interval for @xmath7 : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the @xmath13 and @xmath14-quark pole masses .",
    "note , that in the process fitting the ccfr collaboration @xmath15 structure functions data for @xmath16 dis @xcite both ways of fixation of scale variations were considered for estimating a theoretical error - bar of the extracted expression for @xmath17 .",
    "the first one was used in the case when the number of flavours was fixed as @xmath18 , while the second one was used to estimate the sensitivity of the fitted results to their transformation from @xmath18 numbers of flavours to the energy region with @xmath19 numbers of flavours .",
    "taking into account higher order perturbative corrections in the non - asymptotic qcd regime decreases , as a rule , theoretical errors of the analysed quantities and the extracted qcd parameters , which arise from the variations of scales within the conventionally chosen interval of values . in spite of this",
    ", there is quite understandable desire to formulate more concrete theoretical prescriptions for analysing scale - scheme dependence uncertainties using the rg - based language . among the most applicable at present methods",
    "are the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite , the effective charges ( ech ) @xcite and the brodsky - lepage - mckenzie ( blm ) approaches @xcite .",
    "the first two of them are based on the concepts of scheme - invariant quantities .",
    "both ech and pms approaches are widely used in the concrete phenomenological studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the process of these studies",
    "the gauge - invariant and vertex dependent schemes of defining the qcd coupling constant are usually used .",
    "these schemes include the original ms - scheme @xcite , its g - scheme @xcite and the -scheme @xcite variants , and the number of other similar ms - like schemes , which are unified within the class of @xmath20-schemes @xcite . since all of them are related to the dimensional regularization @xcite and are gauge - invariant , there are no problems with scale - scheme ambiguities of the blm - approach , discussed @xcite in the case of various momentum subtraction ( mom ) schemes , which in qcd depend on the gauge choice .",
    "the first nnlo generalization of the blm approach was formulated in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that it is possible to absorb unambiguously all @xmath21-dependent terms from the nnlo corrections to the rg - invariant measurable quantities , evaluated in the -scheme , by introducing the coupling dependence correction @xmath22 to the blm scale @xmath23 fixed from the nlo approximations of the considered physical quantities .",
    "note that this feature of the generalized blm prescriptions was confirmed in the process of incomplete all - order extension of the blm approach @xcite aimed at resummation of the renormalon - type terms @xmath24 to the blm scales of the perturbative series for the @xmath25- hadronic width and of the relations between the pole and running heavy quark masses .",
    "now let us now consider modern approaches of formulating all - order generalizations of the blm method using the n@xmath4lo approximation for the bjorken sum rule of the polarized lepton - nucleon scattering as an example .",
    "this sum rule is defined as @xmath26 the function @xmath27 contains the non - singlet ( ns ) and singlet ( si ) contributions @xmath28 .",
    "the existence of the si term at the @xmath29 level was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "its concrete analytical expression is not yet fixed by direct diagrammatic calculations .",
    "since we are interested in applications of the generalized blm approaches of @xcite , which are similar to the seblm method @xcite , and of the pmc approach ( see recent reviews @xcite ) , we will neglect this si - type @xmath30- term and consider the expression for @xmath2 .",
    "both methods start with the application of the the @xmath5-expansion of the perturbative -scheme coefficients for @xmath2 . within the seblm - motivated approach of @xcite this concrete structure of the @xmath5-expansion",
    "was obtained in @xcite from the -scheme generalizations of the original crewther relation @xcite fixed at the nnlo in @xcite and at the n@xmath4lo in @xcite by using the @xmath5-expanded @xmath6 representation for the @xmath31 characteristic , namely , the @xmath32 function @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath2 at the n@xmath4lo level @xmath33 was calculated in @xcite in the scheme , @xmath34 .",
    "using the @xmath5-expansion formalism we express the coefficients @xmath35 as @xcite @xmath36 , \\\\",

    "they are * absent * in a similar @xmath5-representation of the perturbative expression for @xmath2 ( see e.g. eq.(160 ) review @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this is more technical than theoretical . as was shown in @xcite , at the nnlo it is possible to get the @xmath5-expansion for the @xmath31 @xmath40-function with the concrete coefficients of the @xmath5-expanded pattern .",
    "it was possible to fix these terms only using an additional to @xmath21 degree of freedom , namely , the number @xmath41 of multiplets of massless gluino .",
    "its analytical contribution to the nnlo correction of the @xmath40-function is known from the results of @xcite , while the additional contributions of @xmath3 to the @xmath42 and @xmath43-functions of qcd with gluino are known from @xcite . since @xmath44 , @xmath45",
    "are liner in both @xmath21 and @xmath3 , this allows us to separate the contributions of @xmath46 and @xmath47 to the nnlo correction of the @xmath48-function and obtain the @xmath5-expansion pattern of the @xmath49 coefficient with 4 terms similar to the ones entering in eq.([c3b ] ) .    note that without this additional information it is impossible to extract the contributions of @xmath43 and @xmath42 to the nnlo corrections of physical quantities from the ordinary @xmath21-expansion of these terms .",
    "indeed , the nnlo correction contains three terms . in the case of polarized @xmath2",
    "the @xmath49 coefficient has the following form : @xmath50 to avoid rather delicate and complicated studies , the authors of @xcite prefer to neglect in the nnlo corrections of their initial -expressions the term , proportional to the single power of @xmath47 .",
    "the price for that is the corruption of the structure of the generalized crewther relations in the -scheme ( see @xcite and @xcite for a more detailed discussion of this subject ) .",
    "note that the generalized crewther relations result from the fundamental properties of the conformal symmetry and its violation by the conformal anomaly in qcd ( for the discussions see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the absence of any information about the calculated effects of the manifestation of additional degrees of freedom ( like the contributions of @xmath3-multiplet of gluinos ) in the analytical expression of the @xmath6 correction to @xmath51 , evaluated in @xcite in the case of @xmath52 colour gauge group , does not allow one to extract analytical expressions for the coefficients @xmath53 $ ] , @xmath54 $ ] , @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath58 $ ] using the ideas proposed in @xcite ( apart from its @xmath59 contribution to @xmath58 $ ] , first determined in @xcite from the application of the original crewther relation @xcite , and the leading term of the @xmath47-expansion with the coefficient @xmath60 $ ] , which is known from the calculations of @xcite ) .",

    "one of the ways to confirm the @xmath5-dependent structure of the nnlo expression for @xmath2 from eqs.([c1b])-([c3b ] ) , which is in agreement with the analytical result of the direct nnlo qcd calculation of @xcite , is to evaluate analytically at the @xmath78-level additional contributions from the @xmath3 multiplets of susy qcd gluinos , as was done @xcite in the case of the @xmath31 characteristic @xmath32 . after this",

    "the prediction of eq.([betaf ] ) was obtained in @xcite using a similar expression for @xmath32 , which result from the calculations of @xcite , detailed considerations of @xcite and following from the conformal symmetry original crewther relation @xcite between the @xmath32 and @xmath81 coefficient functions .",
    "it was also checked in @xcite that the same expression can be obtained from the @xmath49- generalization of the crewther relation , discovered in @xcite . in this relation",
    "the defined by the conformal symmetry term is modified by the to the conformal symmetry breaking term , namely by the factorized @xmath1-function of qcd with @xmath3 multiplets of massless gluino .",
    "we are sure that a direct check of the prediction of eq.([as3 ] ) may give an additional argument in favour of the used in our works form of @xmath5-expansion at the level of nnlo corrections , considered in this report . moreover ,",
    "possible n@xmath4lo evaluation of @xmath82 in qcd with @xmath3 gluino multiplet should clarify how to extract still unknown analytical coefficients of the @xmath5-dependence pattern of the @xmath6 -correction to @xmath82 .",
    "* its analytical coefficients extracted from the @xmath5-expansion procedure of @xcite and the -scheme generalizations of the crewther relation of @xcite , @xcite do not depend on the number of flavours and on the terms proportional to the qcd @xmath5-function .",
    "combined with similar expressions for the coefficients @xmath103 $ ] of the @xmath5- expansion representation of the -scheme expression for the @xmath31 characteristic @xmath40 these coefficients satisfy the scheme - independent relations , which follow from the original crewther relation of @xcite , which is based on the conformal symmetry . * unfortunately , in view of not small @xmath49-term application of the single - scale realisation of the pmc approach of eq.([cnsblm ] ) , which is very similar to the seblm method , spoils the satisfactory convergence of the @xmath49 -scheme approximation of the polarized bjorken sum rule perturbative qcd expression , while the nnlo generalization of the blm - scale of eq.([nnlo ] ) moves the applicability of the resulting perturbative expressions to the region of higher energies .",
    "at the current stage of our studies , presented in detail in @xcite , we discover several phenomenological disadvantages of the applicability of the blm approach , generalized to @xmath49-level even following the application of the @xmath5-expansion formalism , proposed in @xcite and studied in @xcite .",
    "we raise the question of the inappropriate use of this formalism within the principle of maximal conformality considered in @xcite and propose the calculating test , which may give extra argument in favour of the self - consistency of the structure of the @xmath104-expansion approach , as used by us at the @xmath49-level .",
    "we would like also to mention that it is possible to invent the way how to make the generalized blm approach more suitable for high - energy studies .",
    "however , we are still unable to give any straightforward theoretically motivated prescription for its formulation . at present , this work , which was started in @xcite , is based on some empirical observations and necessitates more careful analysis of @xmath6-contributions to the rg - invariant quantities , still unknown within the used version of the theoretically consistent @xmath5-expansion approach .",
    "note , that our studies are also of importance in view of the necessity of better understanding of the applications of the nnlo generalizations of the blm approach to other imprtant observables , like the event - shape distributions @xcite , which are measured precisely at @xmath31-colliders . .",
