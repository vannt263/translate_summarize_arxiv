    "multiple scattering has a great effect on the qualities of images and the transmission of information .",
    "the information will be decayed and the images suffer reduced resolution and contrast because of multiple scattering . for example , the measurement of the laser radar @xcite , satellite communications @xcite , the propagation and imaging of light in the atmosphere @xcite , neutron imaging @xcite and the imaging and diagnosis in life and medical science @xcite .",
    "so the imaging in strong scattering media is always a great problem and presents a key challenge for the research of better imaging method and technique .    in clinic applications ,",
    "the most common imaging modalities include ultrasound imaging , x - ray computed tomography(ct ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) @xcite . as the development of imaging technology",
    ", optical imaging is becoming an increasing interesting method for the imaging in biological tissue . by",
    "now most imaging methods are obtained by using the gating techniques . such as confocal imaging , spatial filtering , optical coherence tomography ( oct ) , mueller optical coherence tomography , diffuse optical tomography ( dot ) , photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) , ultrasound - modulated optical tomograph ( uot ) and so on @xcite .",
    "although the qualities of the images have a great increase by these techniques , there is still lots of problems which are difficult to be done . because the imaging techniques in scattering media discussed above",
    "mainly are only the first - order effect of light field , detection and imaging are unseparated .",
    "when the information of the object is distorted by multiple scattering , and the information of both multiple scattering and the object is unknown , so we can not , in principle , obtain exactly the images destroyed by the multiple scattering , which leads to be impossible of the restoration of the qualities of images caused by multiple scattering .    the first two - photon imaging experiment with entangled source",
    "was demonstrated by pittman _",
    "etal_. in 1995 @xcite , which shew that we could obtain a nonlocal image by transmitting pairs of photons through a test and a reference path .",

    "ghost imaging is considered as the effect of second - order correlation of light field and is caused by the undistinguishable relation of identical particles @xcite .",
    "for the first time , detection and imaging are separated by ghost imaging .",
    "the test path and the reference path are used to detect the information from the object and imaging for the object , respectively .",
    "recently we find that the qualities of ghost images are determined by both the reference path and test path @xcite . because multiple scattering only degrades the imaging quality in the test path , whereas there is no multiple scattering in the reference path . by correlation measurement , we may get a image with much better quality than the image obtained by detection in a single path .",
