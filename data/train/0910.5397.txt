    "the study of classical control theory is ubiquitous across engineering disciplines .",
    "the concept of controllability at the quantum level is a fundamental notion which expresses the ability of implementing _ any _ dynamics in a given quantum mechanical set - up ( see @xcite for an introductory monograph ) . from the practical point of view",
    ", the successful realization of quantum devices for a variety of information processing tasks strongly depends on the ability of manipulating systems with sufficient freedom . the design of protocols to control closed quantum systems mainly deals with schemes for efficient controllability by acting on subspaces @xcite .    a large number of systems have been shown to exhibit characteristics that allow controllability .",
    "for example , almost any pair of hamiltonians that can be coherently applied to a finite - dimensional quantum system renders it controllable , and almost any quantum logic gate is universal @xcite .",
    "however , controllability of large systems does not directly give an efficient implementation of control functions , and therefore processes like universal quantum computation .",
    "moreover , control criteria are generally not computable for large systems and are not immediately scalable with the system size @xcite .",
    "here we consider controllability in relation to a class of dynamics that can be interpreted as schrdinger evolutions of a particle hopping between the vertices of a graph .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonians are matrices with nonzero entries only where transitions are permitted by the graph structure .",
    "this class naturally embraces continuous - time quantum walks ( for short , qws ) @xcite , and the evolution of a single ( or multiple @xcite ) excitation subspace for systems of spin - half particles with various kind of interaction ( _ e.g. _ , xy , xyz , _ etc . _ ) @xcite .",
    "qws have been shown to build gates by scattering off a set of small graphs attached to wires representing basis states @xcite .",
    "qws give examples of matrices for sufficient control , when we can arbitrarily modify edge - weights ( or , equivalently , strength of couplings ) @xcite .    during our discussion ,",
    "an @xmath0-level system is _ controllable _ by a given set of hamiltonians ( possibly acting on specific subsystems only ) if every element of the unitary group @xmath1 can be approximated by the matrices of the subgroup obtained via the dynamical lie algebra of the set .",
    "this general definition is useful to isolate the main difference between the notions of controllability and universality .",
    "for instance , global evolution of a spin system may require complex protocols to implement @xmath2-qubit gates on distant sites , even if it permits complete controllability .",
    "the specific problem addressed here is the following one : we study controllability by the alternate application of two hamiltonians .",
    "one of the hamiltonian describes a nearest - neighbour interaction defined by some graph .",
    "the other hamiltonian is a projector given by the characteristic vector of a subset of vertices .",
    "this describes an interaction between every two spins associated to the elements of the subset .",
    "our main result is to characterize a large family of graphs that give a pair of hamiltonians implementing any quantum dynamics , thereby rendering a system controllable ( section ii ) .",
    "the result can be seen as an analogue of the burgarth - giovannetti infectivity criterion @xcite in this setting involving two hamiltonians .",
    "a comparison with the infectivity criterion , possibly with the use of the notion of zero - forcing @xcite , remains an open question .",
    "it is also an open problem to determine the necessity of our condition .",
    "the proofs follow easily from facts of lie theory and algebraic properties of graphs .",
    "the members of our family present a particularly _ disordered _ cycle structure @xcite .",
    "specifically we require that the number of cycles of a certain length , starting from different vertices , can not be written as a sum of the numbers of smaller cycles",
    ". we will show that this is a property responsible for controllability , when the hamiltonian is the adjacency matrix of the graph .",
    "indeed , we will use powers of the adjacency matrix .",
    "these encode the cycles of a graph ( see the definition of a walk matrix below ) . in analogy with a known result in quantum control theory of spin systems",
    ", the path graph turns out to be the arguably most simple example @xcite .",
    "the setting is directly equivalent to a single excitation evolving on an xy spin chain with constant couplings ( here xy means @xmath3 , _  la _",
    "bose @xcite ) .",
    "the path is a connected graph with minimal number of edges , therefore it corresponds to a very sparse hamiltonian .",
    "this is a fact to take into account , since sparse hamiltonians can be simulated efficiently in a quantum computer @xcite .    in general , focusing only on the dynamics restricted to the @xmath0-dimensional subspace , the physical device for implementation consists of any machine realizing qws ( _ e.g. _ , an optical waveguide lattice @xcite ) . while we do not modify the circuitry for different tasks , an external clock is necessary , since we need to know the time of application of each hamiltonian , even if the resulting operation is just a phase factor",
    ". we will give evidence that our property is almost sure ( section ii ) .",
    "this is parallel to the fact that almost every ( generic ) hamiltonian gives sufficient control . for many types of graphs",
    ", the construction of an infinite family with a typical property may not be straightforward ( _ e.g. _ , expanders , small diameter graphs , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "we will present a method to construct infinite families of graphs ( without special constraints ) that satisfy our required property ( section iii ) .",
    "the results of the paper may translate into valuable information in the perspective of designing schemes for scalable quantum computation via local control ( _ e.g. _ , help in the selection of the systems , the engineering of control functions , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "( see @xcite for extended treatments of this topic . ) from a wider angle , the results consist of a step towards a better and more general understanding quantum evolution on networks .",
    "additionally , we introduce concepts that propose an interface between control theory and graph theory .",
    "the paper has four further sections : section ii contains the general result ; examples are in section iii ; we draw some brief conclusions and state open problems in section iv .",

    "_ ) have found a number of algorithmic applications .",
    "the reviews @xcite give a detailed perspective on this and related topics .",
    "when choosing hamiltonians of the form of @xmath45 , the question to ask about controllability is the following one : can we obtain any quantum dynamics on an @xmath0-level system by performing repeated applications of qws ?",
    "moreover , how much can we limit our resources ( _ e.g. _ , number of non - null interactions , number of different hamiltonians , _ etc .",
    "in particular , can we use just a single qw ( _ i.e. _ , a fixed graph ) plus an extra operation acting on a subspace of a relatively small dimension ?",
    "the latter one is linked to core questions in quantum control theory , where we are interested in driving global dynamics by directly modifying only a limited portion of the system under a parsimony criterion . in the quantum mechanical set - up",
    ", controllability occurs together with the ability of constructing with reasonable accuracy any unitary matrix of the appropriate dimension ( see chapter 3 of @xcite ) .",
