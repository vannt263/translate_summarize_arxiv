    "the number of lam equations modular scalar equivalence with index @xmath0 and projective monodromy group dihedral of order @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath17 .    in @xcite",
    "it is described how the problem of calculating @xmath17 can be translated in counting the number of dessins denfants compatible with prescribed ramification data . in the same article",
    "the combinatorics are performed for @xmath18 , obtaining a result earlier obtained in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an attempt was made to perform the combinatorics for @xmath19 . in this article",
    "we perform the combinatorics for general @xmath20 .",
    "following @xcite , we write the lam equation as in equation [ eqn lame ] , but now with @xmath21 and @xmath22 . according to @xcite the functions ( belyi covers ) @xmath23 which transform , by pull - back , hypergeometric equations into lam equations with index @xmath0 and projective monodromy group dihedral of order @xmath1 , have the following ramification data .",
    "the tables have the following meaning .",
    "all the possible branching points , i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are contained in the first column . in the three corresponding rows , the inverse images ( which are given in the first row ) together with the multiplicities can be read of in the obvious way . for more information",
    "we refer to @xcite or @xcite .",
    "let @xmath26 and suppose @xmath29 .",
    "first consider case i , it will not be necessary to consider the four cases ia , ib , ic , i d separately . in all four cases",
    "there are @xmath0 points above @xmath25 , all with multiplicity @xmath30 .",
    "so the associated dessins consist of @xmath0 cells all with valency @xmath30 . furthermore , there are @xmath31 cycles , which have beginning and end in the point @xmath32 and 3 lines , emanating from @xmath33",
    ". there are no further intersections . in this article , whenever we draw dessins denfants , we will not draw the vertices .",
    "we define the valency of a line as the number of edges of that line and the valency of a cycle as half the number of edges of that cycle . with these definitions",
    "we define the valency of a cell as the sum of the valencies of the lines it contains and the cycles that bound it .",
    "we note that the valency of a cell equals the multiplicity of the inverse image of @xmath25 lying in the cell .",
    "we see that the boundary of every cell contains exactly one ore two cycles ( since we assumed @xmath29 ) .",
    "a cell with exactly one cycle in its boundary will be called a _",
    "simple cell_. since all the cells have the same valency and there are only three lines , there can be no more than three simple cells .",
    "there is of course a minimum of two simple cells .",
    "these two cases , that of two simple cells ( case a ) and that of three simple cells ( case b ) , will be considered seperately .",
    "we will now take into account the three lines ( but still do not take into account the valencies ) .",
    "each of the two simple cells must contain at least one line ( since every cell has the same valency ) .",
    "if each of the three lines are contained in a simple cell , there is ( because of rotational symmetry ) only one possibility .",
    "we call this case ai . the dessin has the following shape :    if there is a line which is not contained in a simple cell , there are @xmath34 possible cells that can contain it . for every of these @xmath34 cells the line can lie on two different sides , but if we take into account the rotational symmetry , we see that the number of possibilities is reduced by a factor two .",
    "so in this case we arrive at exactly @xmath34 different kinds of dessins .",
    "we call this case aii .",
    "the dessins are of the following shape :      we will now take into account the valencies of the cycles and lines .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the valencies as given in figures [ fig caseai ] and [ fig caseaii ] . in both cases we have @xmath36 ( and @xmath37 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to see ( by induction ) that for every such triple @xmath38 there is exactly one possible dessin ( for a fixed shape of the dessin ) .",
    "now there are @xmath39 possible triples @xmath38 .",
    "we conclude that there are exactly @xmath39 possible dessins of type ai and there are exactly @xmath40 possible dessins of type aii .",
    "so there are exactly @xmath41 possible dessins of type a.      we first consider these dessins without taking into account rotational symmetry .",
    "since @xmath42 ( and @xmath43 ) there are @xmath44 possibilities for the triple @xmath45 .",
    "note that for @xmath46 we also arrive at the correct answer , namely zero .",
    "we will now take into account the valencies of the cycles and lines .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the valencies as given in figure [ fig caseb ] .",
    "we have @xmath36 ( and @xmath37 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to see ( by induction ) that for every such triple @xmath38 there is exactly one possible dessin ( for fixed @xmath47 and not taken into account the rotational symmetry yet ) .",
    "now there are @xmath39 possible triples @xmath38 .",
    "we conclude that there are @xmath48 possible dessins of type b , not taken into account the rotational symmetry .",
    "if we now do take into account the rotational symmetry , we see that we have counted every dessin three times , except when the dessin has a three fold rotational symmetry .",
    "there is exactly one dessin with a three fold rotational symmetry if and only if @xmath30 and the number of cycles are divisible by 3 , i.e. @xmath49 and @xmath50 , otherwise there are no such dessins .",
    "we conclude that there are exactly @xmath51 possible dessins of type b.      it remains to be proven that there are no dessins of type ii . in case",
    "ii there are @xmath53 points above @xmath25 , @xmath31 with multiplicity @xmath30 and two with multiplicity @xmath54 .",
    "so the associated dessins consist of @xmath53 cells , @xmath31 with multiplicity @xmath30 and two with multiplicity @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , there are @xmath0 cycles and 1 line , which emanate from @xmath55",
    ". there are no further intersections . from the fact that there are two cells with valency strictly smaller than @xmath30 , all other cells have valency @xmath30 and",
    "there is one line , we conclude that ( again ) there are either 2 simple cells ( case c ) or 3 simple cells ( case d ) .      let @xmath35 denote the valencies as given in the left part of figure [ fig casec ] .",
    "we must have @xmath56 and by induction we obtain that all the non simple cells have valency @xmath30 and that @xmath57 .",
    "so @xmath58 , but this means that there is only one cell with valency @xmath54 . we conclude that there are no dessins of type ci .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the valencies as given in the right part of figure [ fig casec ] .",
    "we must have @xmath60 .",
    "since all non simple cells must have valency @xmath30 , we obtain by induction that @xmath61 .",
    "so @xmath62 , but this means that there is a cell with valency larger that @xmath30 .",
    "we conclude that there are no dessins of type cii .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the valencies as given in figure [ fig cased ] .",
    "we must have @xmath60 .",
    "since all non simple cells must have valency @xmath30 we obtain by induction that @xmath61 .",
    "so @xmath63 , but this means that there is a cell with valency larger that @xmath30 .",
    "we conclude that there are also no dessins of type d. so there are no dessins of type ii .",
    "we note that for @xmath18 the proof that there are no dessins of type ii also applies ( but only case ci has to be considered and there is only one cycle ) .",
    "we have proven our theorem for @xmath64 . for @xmath18",
    "the combinatorics was done in @xcite ( and for @xmath18 the result was already obtained in @xcite by other means ) , but the combinatorics can be simplified significantly as follows .    as noted before there are no dessins corresponding to type ii .",
    "so let us consider case i. there is only one point above @xmath25 , which has multiplicity @xmath30 .",
    "so the associated dessins consist of one cell with valency @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore there are no cycles and three lines , who come together in the point @xmath55 .",
    "the dessin has the following shape :    let @xmath65 denote the valencies of the three lines .",
    "if we do not take into account the rotational symmetry , then the number of dessins equals the number of triples @xmath38 with @xmath36 ( and @xmath37 ) .",
    "there are @xmath39 such triples .",
    "if we now do take into account the rotational symmetry , we see that we have counted every dessin three times , except when the dessin has a three fold rotational symmetry .",
    "there is exactly one dessin with a three fold rotational symmetry if and only if @xmath49 , otherwise there are no such dessins .",
    "we conclude that there are exactly @xmath66 possible dessins when @xmath18 .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "let @xmath16 .",
    "we denote by @xmath69 euler s totient function , i.e. @xmath70 and by @xmath71 the two dimensional analog , i.e. @xmath72 from the theorem above , together with the well known results @xmath73 we easily obtain the following .",
