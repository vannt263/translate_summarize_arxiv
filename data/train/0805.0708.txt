    "a galactic plane survey was performed in 2004 by the h.e.s.s .   imaging atmospheric cerenkov telescope ( iact ) with a flux sensitivity of 0.02  crab for gamma rays above 200gev @xcite .",
    "fourteen new gamma - ray sources were detected at significance levels above 4@xmath8 , and 11 of the sources either have no counterpart or possible counterparts with significant positional offsets .",
    "hess j1804@xmath0216 is one of the brightest , and its spectrum is softest in this survey ; the flux is about 0.25  crab above 200gev with a photon index of @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , with a size of @xmath10  arcmin , it is one of the most extended tev gamma - ray sources .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration proposed two possible counterparts : the supernova remnant ( snr ) g8.7@xmath00.1 and the young vela - like pulsar b1800@xmath021 .",
    "however , the tev gamma - ray source does not coincide exactly with either of these .",
    "g8.7@xmath00.1 appears as a larger circular region with a diameter of @xmath11  arcmin , and the geometric center @xcite has a large offset , @xmath12 arcmin , from the centroid of hess j1804@xmath0216 to the northeast , while psr b1800@xmath021 has an @xmath12 arcmin offset to the west .",
    "after the detection of hess j1804@xmath0216 , an snr , g8.31@xmath00.09 , was discovered at radio wavelengths @xcite to be located within the error circle of hess j1804@xmath0216 , but with a smaller size , @xmath13 .",
    "_ suzaku _ deep observations discovered two new x - ray sources , suzaku j1804@xmath02142 ( hereafter src1 ) and suzaku j1804@xmath02140 ( hereafter src2 ) , that are near the center of hess j1804@xmath0216 @xcite .",

    "the other positionally coincides with suzaku src2 .",

    "radio recombination - line observations have been used to identify discrete sources as h@xmath14 regions , and co observations also show molecular gas to be associated with w30 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that massive star formation may be occurring in molecular clouds in w30 . @xcite and @xcite clearly established that g8.7@xmath00.1 was an snr by the detection of a nonthermal extended radio emission .",

    "observation revealed diffuse x - ray emission only from the northern half of the remnant in the 0.12.4kev band @xcite .",
    "the distance to g8.7@xmath00.1 was estimated using several methods .",

    "they also estimated the distance based on a sedov solution @xcite from the observed x - ray temperature and the angular radius to derive 3.2kpc@xmath164.3kpc for an assumed initial energy of @xmath17 ergs . in this paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath18kpc .",
    "they also estimated the age of the snr , based on a sedov solution from the x - ray observation , to be 1.52.8@xmath19 years under the assumption of an initial energy of @xmath17 ergs , and 2.73.9@xmath19 years under the assumption of a distance of 6kpc .",

    "however , a recent proper - motion measurement @xcite has shown that the pulsar was born outside the currently observed snr , and that is moving more nearly toward the center of g8.7@xmath00.1 , rather than away from it , which makes their association very unlikely .",
    "based on a 10ks observation with the _ rosat _ pspc , finley & gelman ( 1994 ) reported a faint x - ray source near the radio pulsar position , and attributed this emission to psr b1800@xmath021 .",

    "the unabsorbed flux , which was estimated from the _ chandra _ observation using the best - fit parameters reported by @xcite , is a factor of @xmath38 1.7 smaller than that reported with the _ suzaku _ observation of @xcite .",
    "the difference could be due to unaccounted systematic errors , or the variability of the source , which supports the hmxb interpretation @xcite .",
    "suzaku src2 : the offset from the centroid of hess j1804@xmath0216 is 1.8  arcmin . though @xcite reported that src2 is extended or multiple , based on the _ suzaku _ observation , @xcite reported that src2 is point - like in a _",

    "@xcite stated that the large absorption suggests that src2 is located within ( or even beyond ) the galactic bulge , or it shows an intrinsic absorption , which is often seen in the x - ray spectra of hmxbs .",
    "@xcite also reported a marginal pulsation of 106  s in src2 , which supports an hmxb interpretation . on the other hand",

    "none of the above five sources morphologically match hess j1804@xmath0216 .",
    "the counterpart is therefore still unknown . in this paper , we present tev gamma - ray observations of hess j1804@xmath0216 with the cangaroo - iii telescopes and discuss the radiation mechanism and the counterpart by combining our result with multi - wavelength observations .",

    "the observations of hess j1804@xmath0216 were made from may to july , 2006 , using the ` wobble ' mode in which the pointing position of each telescope was shifted in declination by @xmath420.5@xmath41 from the centroid of hess j1804@xmath0216 .",
    "the mean zenith angle of the observation was 21@xmath41 , and the total observation time was 86.8 hr . we used the 3-fold coincidence data taken at zenith angles of less than 40@xmath41 . to trigger data recording , an individual telescope was required to have more than four pixels receiving over 7.6 photoelectrons within 100ns ( local trigger ) , with a global trigger system to determine the coincidence of any two of the three telescopes @xcite .",
    "we rejected data taken under bad weather conditions in which the shower event rate was less than 6hz .",

    "these bad pixels were removed from this analysis , which was also reflected in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "after that , every shower image was cleaned through the following cangaroo - iii standard criteria .",
    "only pixels that received @xmath435.0 photoelectrons were used as `` hit pixels '' .",
    "then , five or more adjacent hit pixels , with arrival times of within 30ns from the average hit time of all pixels , were recognized as a shower cluster .    before calculating image moments",

    "we rejected events with any hits in the outer - most layer of the camera .",
    "the orientation angles were determined by minimizing the sum of the squared widths with a constraint given by the distance predicted by monte carlo simulations .",

    "additionally , the old snr shock colliding with a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) can emit hard nonthermal x - rays from secondary electrons and strong tev gamma rays from shock accelerated protons through @xmath79 decay .",

    "a similar picture is observed around the vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "these phenomena can be explained by the `` crushed pwn '' hypothesis @xcite : on a time scale of @xmath80 years , the reverse snr shock front propagates toward the center of the remnant , where it crushes the pwn , and asymmetries in the surrounding interstellar medium give rise to an asymmetric shape and offset of the pwn relative to the pulsar and explosion site .",
    "@xcite considered the possibility that suzaku src1 or src2 are a pwn powering hess j1804@xmath0216 .",
    "however , the 3.24  s time resolution of the _ chandra _ acis observation precludes a search for the subsecond pulse periods expected for a young pulsar .",
    "therefore , there is no strong evidence to support it at this point .",

    "its asymmetric pwn component extending toward hess j1804@xmath0216 , detected by _",
    "@xcite , shows a hint of the association , but the sensitivity of the _ chandra _ observation was possibly insufficient to detect the pwn beyond 15@xmath8120@xmath81 from the pulsar .",
    "additionally , they pointed out that the extended morphology of hess j1804@xmath0216 argues against the hmxb interpretation because of the weak observational evidence for hmxbs producing extended tev gamma - ray emission .",
    "@xcite concluded that psr b1800@xmath021 can not account for the spectrum of hess j1804@xmath0216 , and g8.7@xmath00.1 is probably the source of the tev gamma rays .",
