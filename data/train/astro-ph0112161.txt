    "clustering of mass in the universe is believed to be a result of amplification by gravitational instability of small perturbations generated in the early universe .",
    "comparison with theoretical predictions offers the chance to test models of the generation of the perturbations , as well as putting important constraints on cosmological parameters , which control the growth rate of the perturbations .",
    "a fundamental limitation on such a comparison has been that theoretical models predict the clustering properties of the mass in the universe , and yet we have few direct measures of mass observationally . more readily observable is the distribution of luminous objects such as galaxies , so to compare with theory one has to determine , or assume , the relationship between the clustering of mass and the clustering of galaxies . in general",
    "one will expect these to differ , because the efficiency of galaxy formation may depend in some nontrivial way on the underlying mass distribution .",
    "the idea that structures may be ` biased ' tracers of the mass distribution goes back to , who explained the high clustering strength of abell clusters as due to their forming in high - density regions of the universe .",
    "in addition , observations indicating that different types of galaxy cluster differently ( e.g. ) show that they can not all be unbiased tracers of the mass . bias became an attractive way to reconcile the low velocities of galaxies with the high - density einstein - de sitter model favoured in the 1980s ( e.g. ) , but after the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) determined the amplitude of primordial fluctuations on large scales @xcite , the ` standard ' biased cold dark matter ( cdm ) model became less popular . with the advent of more detailed datasets in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large - scale structure , it is possible to investigate and constrain a wider range of galaxy formation models , and an unknown bias relation adds uncertainty to the process .    since the efficiency of galaxy formation is not well understood theoretically , it makes sense to try to measure it empirically from observations .",
    "when the perturbations are small ( or on large , linear scales ) , it is difficult to do this : there is a degeneracy between the unknown amplitude of the matter power spectrum @xmath9 and the degree of bias , @xmath10 , defined such that the galaxy power spectrum is @xmath11 . in principle , @xmath10 may be a function of scale , through the wavenumber @xmath12 . at later times ( or on smaller scales ) , however , the degeneracy is lifted by nonlinear effects .",
    "one feature of nonlinear gravitational evolution is that the overdensity field @xmath13 becomes progressively more skewed towards high density . in principle skewness",
    "could also arise from non - gaussian initial conditions ; in practice this can be neglected @xcite , since cmb fluctuations are consistent with gaussian initial conditions @xcite .",
    "one can thus hope to exploit the gravitational skewness , but skewness could equally well arise from biasing , e.g. from a galaxy formation efficiency that increased at dense points in the mass field .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to distinguish these two effects by considering the _ shapes _ of isodensity regions .",
    "if the field is unbiased , then the shapes of isodensity contours become flattened , as gravitational instability accelerates collapse along the short axis of structures , leading to sheet - like and filamentary structures ( e.g. ) . if the galaxy field is highly biased with the same power spectrum , however , the underlying mass field is of low amplitude , and thus expected to be close to the initial field , which is assumed to be gaussian .",
    "these fields do not have highly - flattened isodensity contours , as bias does not flatten the contours ; for example eulerian bias preserves the contour shape .",
    "thus there is a difference which could be detected , for example , by studying the three - point correlation function . in this paper",
    ", we exploit this effect in fourier space rather than real space , by analysing the bispectrum : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the fourier transform of the galaxy overdensity field .",
    "the theory for the bispectrum is set out in , , , , , and .",
    "the galaxy survey we use is the anglo - australian telescope 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite , as compiled in february 2001 .",
    "it was created with the 2df multi - fibre spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope @xcite , and currently consists of over 200,000 galaxies with redshifts up to about @xmath16 , broadly in two regions centred near the south and north galactic poles .",
    "see http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dfgrs/ for further details .",
    "it is the first survey which is large enough to put tight constraints on the bias parameter , as previous surveys are too shallow or too sparse . in this paper",
    ", we use 127,000 galaxies from the february 2001 compilation of the catalogue , truncated at @xmath17 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we review the theory of growth of the bispectrum through gravitational instability , and discuss briefly the effects of redshift - space distortions ; in section 3 we illustrate our method of measuring the bias parameter .",
    "this method uses a new estimator of the bias parameter , which allows us to analyse many millions of @xmath18-vector triplets , thus drastically improving the signal to noise . in section 4",
    "we test the performance of the method . finally in section 5 we present our results and in section 6 we discuss the implications of these results .",
    "an appendix presents and describes in detail our new estimator of the bias parameter .",
    "the statistic we use to measure the bias of the galaxies is the bispectrum @xmath19 , which is related to the three - point correlation function in fourier space . for the mass ,",
    "this is defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fourier transform of the mass overdensity @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the dirac delta function , which shows that the bispectrum can be non - zero only if the @xmath18-vectors close to form a triangle .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath24 is similarly defined by @xmath25 analogous relations hold for the power spectrum and bispectrum of the galaxy distribution .",
    "we assume that the mass overdensity is a gaussian random field initially , as closely predicted by inflationary early universe models .",
    "thus , at asymptotically early times the bispectrum is zero by symmetry .",
    "as gravitational instability develops , the field becomes asymmetric , because nonlinear effects skew the density field to high densities . in this way , a non - zero bispectrum develops . in the mildly nonlinear regime , we use second - order perturbation theory to compute the expected bispectrum . to second order ( in the overdensity @xmath26 )",
    "the fourier coefficients develop a nonlinear component which is proportional to @xmath27 , so the leading order term in the bispectrum grows like @xmath28 . since the 2dfgrs is not a survey of mass density , to interpret the bispectrum measured from the survey we must make some assumption about the distribution of mass relative to the distribution of galaxies . to date ,",
    "this uncertainty in the relationship between the mass and the galaxy distribution has placed a limitation on the usefulness of galaxy catalogues as a probe of cosmology .",
    "we make the assumption that the galaxy overdensity field @xmath29 is related to the underlying mass overdensity by some deterministic function , which we expand in a taylor series as ( cf . ) @xmath30 we must keep terms up to @xmath31 , since these enter in the bispectrum at the same level as second - order perturbation theory growth terms , and we ignore higher - order terms . in order for @xmath29 to have zero mean ,",
    "there is a ( calculable ) @xmath32 term , but we ignore it as it contributes only to @xmath33 ; @xmath34 is the linear bias parameter , and @xmath35 is the quadratic bias parameter .",
    "a non - zero @xmath35 would indicate nonlinear biasing of galaxies with respect to mass .",
    "both of these parameters are estimated in this paper from the 2dfgrs .    in real space ,",
    "the two effects of nonlinear growth and nonlinear bias contribute terms to a non - zero bispectrum : @xmath36 + { \\rm cyc . }",

    "details of the theory leading to ( [ eq : bispectrum1 ] ) may be found in e.g. .",
    "we assume here that the galaxy power spectrum is @xmath37 ( see for discussion of this point ) ; @xmath38 is a function that depends on the shape of the triangle in @xmath39space , but only very weakly on cosmology ( e.g. ) .",
    "note that we assume a deterministic bias ; other authors ( e.g. ; ; ) have investigated stochastic bias , where there is a random component to the relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath29 . in the case of stochastic bias",
    "the bispectrum has still the form of equation ( 3 ) but the function @xmath38 is modified into @xmath40 in such a way that when the correlation coefficient of the stochastic bias @xmath41 goes to unity ( i.e. bias becomes deterministic ) , @xmath42 .",
    "theoretical considerations suggest that @xmath43 on scales of interest ( e.g. tegmark & peebles 1998 ; blanton et al .",
    "2000 ; seljak 2000 ) .    in redshift space , both the power spectrum and the bispectrum",
    "are modified by redshift - space distortions , arising because the distance estimator ( the redshift ) is perturbed by peculiar velocities .",
    "these distortions are radial in nature , and can be analysed , at some expense in complexity , in radial and angular basis functions ( e.g. ) . here",
    ", we adopt the distant - observer approximation @xcite , and assume that nonlinear effects can be modelled by an incoherent small - scale velocity field , characterised by the pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath44 .",
    "the large - scale in - fall leads to distortions which depend on the redshift distortion parameter @xmath45 , where @xmath7 is the matter density parameter .",
    "assuming in addition an exponential distribution for the pairwise velocity the combined effect gives the power spectrum in redshift space ( denoted by subscript @xmath46 ) @xmath47 ( e.g. ) , where @xmath48 is the cosine of the wavevector to the line of sight , which is a fixed direction in the distant observer approximation .",
    "other modifications have been suggested , such as a gaussian , or exponential one - particle velocity dispersion , which yield different functional forms for the redshift distortion .",

    "we find that the formula ( 6 ) recovers the true bias parameter in an ensemble of simulated biased 2dfgrs catalogues with smaller scatter than ( [ roman ] ) .",
    "we see from ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) how the bispectrum can allow us to measure the bias parameters .",

    "we have used multiple mock catalogues @xcite with the same selection criteria as the survey regions to check that this assumption does not feed through into a biased estimate of the bias parameters .",
    "also , the power spectrum and bispectrum estimates are convolved with the window function this can lead to changes in shape from convolution , and erroneous interpretation of correlated noise as real features in the power spectrum .",
    "these effects are , however , not important in the wavenumber range ( @xmath74mpc@xmath1 ) which we use for the bispectrum analysis ( ) .    to compute the @xmath75 , we generated random catalogues with approximately 5 times as many particles as the real catalogue , and analysed the north and south galactic pole regions ( ngp & sgp ) separately .",
    "we ignored the random fields present in the 2dfgrs as these complicate the window function and add very little information for the current analysis .",
    "fast fourier transforms were performed on a @xmath76 grid which encompassed all the particles , leading to a grid spacing of about 1 @xmath2mpc .",
    "( 90,55 )      we use the real parts of @xmath77 as our data , for triangles in @xmath18 space ( i.e. where @xmath78 ) .",
    "each triangle allows us to estimate a linear combination of the parameters natural to this analysis : @xmath79 and @xmath80 , through equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "note that we must use triangles of different shape ( and hence different @xmath81 $ ] ) to lift the degeneracy between nonlinear gravity and nonlinear bias . as explained in the introduction ,",
    "this is equivalent to analysing the shapes of structures , which are different in the two cases .",
    "there is clearly a huge number of possible triangles to investigate ( many millions ) , and we are faced with a problem of how to choose the triangles to analyse .",
    "the problem is that triangles which have a wavevector in common will be correlated , through cross - terms in the 6-point function .",
    "a likelihood analysis as originally suggested in and with millions of correlated data is unfeasible , so we take a different approach .",
    "we use two sets of triangles of different configurations : one set with one wavevector twice the length of another , and another set with two wavevectors of common length . for the former , calibrations with mock catalogues give @xmath82 , and the latter @xmath83 .",
    "we set a lower limit to the wavenumber range of @xmath84mpc@xmath1 , to avoid the effects of convolution with the window function @xcite .",
    "we set an upper limit of @xmath85mpc@xmath1 where , for the 2dfgrs power spectrum , shot noise begins to dominate the signal so that little further is gained by increasing the limit .",
    "in addition , we impose a constraint @xmath86mpc@xmath1 for the second configuration choice , where perturbation theory for this configuration begins to break down .",
    "this leaves us with 80 million triangles .",
    "two considerations motivate us to consider `` only '' these 80 million triangles : _ i _ ) adding more highly correlated triangles complicates the analysis significantly and does not add much signal and _ ii _ ) more importantly , only these two configurations have been extensively tested against fully non - linear n - body simulations .",
    "in fact not only perturbation theory may breakdown on different scales depending on the triangle configuration , but also the ( shape dependent ) redshift space distortion parameter @xmath52 ( eq .",
    "6 ) has been calibrated only for these two configurations .",
    "to cope with so many triangles , we define a new estimator for @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the appendix .",
    "although the estimator is not minimum - variance , it is unbiased and has the big advantage that it allows us to analyze many triangles , thus increasing the signal to noise .",
    "the estimator does not give error bars ; these are obtained by monte carlo simulation from 16 mock 2dfgrs catalogues ( see section 4 ) .",

    "the dotted line shows the perturbation theory prediction for @xmath87 , @xmath88 while the dashed line shows the shot noise contribution . for the bispectrum ,",
    "the shot noise contribution becomes dominant around @xmath89mpc@xmath1 .",
    "we have used 16 mock catalogues from a hubble volume n - body simulation with @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( ` @xmath92cdm ' model ) , with the same selection function as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( ) .",
    "this includes both the radial selection function and an angular mask that reflects the varying completeness of the survey in february 2001 .",
    "the catalogues contain mock galaxies whose positions are determined according to the prescription described in .",
    "this is a 2-parameter exponential model based on the final density field , i.e. it does _ not _ conform to our assumption of equation ( [ eq : bias ] ) .",
    "we will show that nevertheless the bispectrum method recovers the bias parameter @xmath34 , defined by the square root of the ratio of the galaxy and matter power spectra .",
    "this is the crucial test , since it is this ratio that we wish to determine , as we can then translate the galaxy power spectrum to the underlying mass spectrum . for the simulated galaxies in the hubble volume as a whole the square root of the power spectrum ratio varies between about 0.9 at large scales and 0.75 at @xmath85mpc@xmath1 . over the scales probed by our bispectrum triangles ,",
    "the bias is roughly 0.8 , but with an uncertainty which ultimately limits our error determination .",
    "the power spectrum of the simulated 2dfgrs catalogues varies a little , so we estimate @xmath93 individually for each catalogue ( and individually for sgp and ngp ) , from the wavenumber range @xmath94mpc@xmath1 .",
    "this sets @xmath56 for each sample , and we fit the pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath44 individually by requiring a good fit to the redshift - space power spectrum , using the real - to - redshift mapping of equation ( 9 ) .",
    "we then analyse the set of triangles for each simulation , as detailed above , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltab ] we show the error in the bias from 16 simulations in the sgp and ngp .",

    "[ fig : deltab ] shows that the approximations made in the analysis ( e.g. the functional form of the bias , the window function , the distant observer approximation etc . )",
    "do not significantly bias the result .",

    "we also carried out the same analysis on 16 mock catalogues of the sgp obtained from the hubble volume simulation for a @xmath99cdm model .",
    "the true underlying bias parameter is correctly recovered with a 20% error ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the error in the natural parameter @xmath101 is comparable for the @xmath92cdm and @xmath99cdm models , but the value of @xmath34 itself is larger in the latter case . in fig .",

    "we analyse the catalogue as compiled in february 2001 ( i.e. the same catalogue as in ) , and we analyse the ngp and sgp regions separately ; we excise the random fields entirely .",
    "this leaves us with 75792 and 51862 galaxies in the sgp and ngp respectively .",
    "the two survey regions give us a useful consistency check .",
    "we initially present results fixing @xmath103 and @xmath104 km@xmath105s@xmath1 ( 3.85 @xmath2 mpc ) .",
    "these are the best - fitting values from the analysis of the 2dfgrs redshift - space correlation function (; see also ) .",
    "note that this value of @xmath56 involves a bias parameter that is defined somewhat differently from ours , in terms of the correlation function .",
    "this bias parameter will coincide with our @xmath34 only if certain assumptions hold , such as if the overdensity in galaxies is everywhere @xmath34 times the mass overdensity .",
    "in due course , @xmath56 can be determined by analysis of the 2dfgrs power spectrum itself , but for the time being we assume that the two bias parameters are the same .",
    "finally , we will marginalise over @xmath56 and @xmath44 .",
    "( 90,55 )      it is difficult to find a method to display in a single figure all of the information from the 80 million triangles used : for this reason we display only one configuration and for the sgp alone ; adding other configurations ( or the ngp ) would complicate the figure .",
    "[ fig : bispectrumfrac ] shows the sgp data for configurations with two wavevectors of common length , along with the perturbation theory predictions for different combinations of the linear and quadratic bias parameters .",
    "the dashed and dot - dashed lines are the perturbation theory prediction for @xmath106 , @xmath88 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "the error bars come from the mock catalogues , and the offset between the centres of the error bars and the points shows the bias in the estimator .    fixing the values of @xmath56 and @xmath44 , and including all of the triangles in the sgp gives as a raw result @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "the ngp linear bias is slightly higher : @xmath111 , @xmath112 . adjusting these results with the estimator bias obtained from the mock catalogues ( section 4 ) , and associating an error from the mock catalogues gives @xmath113 and a combined minimum - variance weighted result of @xmath114 note that the estimator bias does not significantly alter the results : ignoring it increases the estimate by 0.03 , much less than the statistical error .",
    "our estimate of the quadratic bias parameter from the ngp and sgp 2dfgrs is @xmath115 with sgp and ngp individually giving @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively .",
    "thus we see that the 2dfgrs galaxies are perfectly consistent with tracing the underlying mass distribution on these scales ( wavelengths @xmath118 = 13 to 63 @xmath2mpc ) i.e. @xmath34 is consistent with unity , and @xmath35 with zero .",

    "we have consistently used all the galaxies in the 2dfgrs ngp and sgp regions , to determine @xmath56 and the bias parameters . with the weighting scheme employed to measure @xmath56 and @xmath34 ,",
    "the weighted mean luminosity is @xmath122 . from studies of the correlation function , found a luminosity dependence in the relative bias of 2dfgrs galaxies : @xmath123 .",

    "the 2dfgrs galaxies , as a population , trace the mass extremely well .    on scale - dependence of the bias ,",
    "it is worth noting that theoretical arguments ( e.g. ) suggest that bias is expected to be constant on large scales ( larger than a few @xmath2mpc ) and a scale - dependent bias is plausible on intermediate scales , but the scale dependence is expected to be weak .",
    "we find no evidence of scale - dependent bias ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . both scale - dependence and luminosity - dependence may be explored in detail when the catalogue is complete .",
    "analysis of the redshift - space correlation function allows one to estimate @xmath127 @xcite , and this can be combined with our determination of @xmath34 to estimate the matter density parameter @xmath7 .",
    "a strength of the result is that it is obtained from the 2dfgrs alone , independently of all other datasets .",
    "following the same procedure as in the previous subsection , we marginalise over the uncertainty in @xmath56 and @xmath44 , to get : @xmath128 the small size of the error bar is worth remarking on .",
    "for each pair of values of @xmath56 and @xmath44 , we obtain an estimate of @xmath34 .",
    "the estimates of @xmath56 and @xmath34 are slightly anti - correlated , which leads to a slightly smaller scatter in @xmath7 than one would expect from the errors on @xmath56 and @xmath34 .",
    "this result is consistent with other recent determinations by other methods such as combining cmb with large - scale structure or supernova measurements ( e.g. ) and from early weak lensing measurements @xcite .",
    "previous work has concentrated on using cumulants , although there have been two analyses @xcite of the bispectrum of infrared - selected galaxies observed with the infrared astronomy satellite ( iras ; ) .",
    "the iras samples are much smaller than the current 2dfgrs , and are also rather shallow , so shot noise and the radial nature of the redshift distortion is more severe than for the 2dfgrs .",
    "nevertheless , bias estimates have been made , and reported with remarkably small error bars .",
    "the most accurate quoted values are from @xmath129 for the pscz survey @xcite .",
    "this value of the linear bias parameter is consistent with our determinations , since iras galaxies have a power spectrum which is lower than optically selected galaxies , by a factor @xmath130 on the relevant scales @xcite .    studies of the skewness , kurtosis and higher - order moments of the optical galaxy distribution ( e.g. ) have also shown consistency with a linear bias of unity , but here we are able to derive both the linear bias and the quadratic bias simultaneously .",
    "in addition , our present results are more accurate and convert these general indications of a low degree of bias into a strong constraint on theoretical models .",
    "we have demonstrated through analysis of the bispectrum of the 2dfgrs that the optically - selected galaxies of the sample trace the matter density extremely well on large scales ( fourier modes with @xmath131 mpc@xmath1 that approximately correspond to @xmath132 mpc ) .",
    "specifically , the linear bias parameter is very close to unity , and the quadratic ( nonlinear ) bias is very close to zero .",
    "ironically , this is exactly the assumption which used to be made decades ago in large - scale structure analysis , but which was questioned when the concept of biased galaxy formation was introduced ( e.g. ) .",
    "theoretical arguments suggest that an initial bias at formation approaches unity with time , provided that galaxies are neither created nor destroyed @xcite , and that the universe does not become curvature- or vacuum - dominated in the meantime @xcite . in any case",
    ", these assumptions will clearly fail at some level .",
    "note that the effective depth of the survey is @xmath8 and our measurement should be interpreted as the bias and @xmath7 at this epoch ( for additional discussion see ) . because of a tendency for bias to approach unity with time , we do not by this measurement rule out a significant bias of galaxies at formation time , but the unbiased nature of the galaxies today puts a significant constraint on theoretical models of galaxy formation .",
    "currently , we find no evidence of scale - dependent bias ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bispectrumfrac ] ) .",
    "the size of the survey at the present time does not allow us to place strong constraints on scale dependence or luminosity dependence of the bias parameter , or on the nature of biasing ( e.g. deterministic , stochastic , eulerian , lagrangian etc . ) , but these issues will be explored with the completion of the survey . at some level nonlinear bias must appear on small scales , from the morphology - density relation ( ) , but this is probably on too small scales for the perturbative method of this paper to be valid .    our measurement of the matter density of the universe @xmath133 should be interpreted as @xmath7 at the effective redshift of the survey .",
    "the extrapolation at @xmath134 is model - dependent , but the changes this correction introduces are below the quoted error - bars for reasonnable choices of model .",
    "our measurement is in agreement with other independent determinations such as cosmic microwave background together with hubble constant constraints ( e.g. ) which also give comparable error bars .",
    "it is worth re - emphasising that the analysis presented here relies _ only _ on the 2dfgrs dataset .",
    "it is also important that we not only conclude that the linear bias is essentially unity , but also the quadratic ( nonlinear ) bias term is constrained to be very close to zero .",
    "taken together , these measurements argue powerfully that the 2dfgrs galaxies do indeed trace the mass on large scales .",
    "in addition to our findings , joint analysis of the 2dfgrs and cmb data @xcite also supports our conclusion that the 2dfgrs galaxies are unbiased .",
    "different methods of measuring linear bias require different assumptions , and it is remarkable that such different methods agree on the basic cosmological model .",
