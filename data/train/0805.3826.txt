    ", @xmath5 should include the vertices of the holes and the ends of the slits .",
    "it also applies to translation surfaces , and thus also to tori with slits .",
    "we will prove in section [ three ] that any neighbourhood of the conical points satisfies condition @xmath15 on any escs   so that we could have stated the theorem without refering to this condition .",
    "we have stated it thus in order to emphasize the fact that such a control result usually requires two distinct steps .",
    "the first step is to find some geometric or dynamical condition that implies control , and the second step is to find settings where this condition holds .",
    "these two steps proceed from essentially different methods : analytic in the case of the first step , and geometric / dynamical in the case of the second .",
    "the organization of the paper reflects the two steps of the proof described in the preceding remark .",
    "we first recall in section  [ two ] some basic facts about escss , semiclassical measures and the doubling procedure that allows one to treat polygonal billiards .    in section",
    "[ three ] , we will prove that @xmath15 implies control . to do this",
    ", we shall argue by contradiction in the following way .",
    "assume that there is no @xmath31 such that holds .",
    "then there is a sequence @xmath32 of normalized eigenfunctions with eigenvalues @xmath33 , whose mass in @xmath1 tends to zero as @xmath34 .",
    "associated to such a sequence is ( at least one ) semiclassical measure @xmath35 which is necessarily supported away from the inverse image @xmath36  see lemma  [ supp ] .",

    "we shall show that the support property of @xmath35 just mentioned and the geometric condition @xmath15 imply that @xmath35 would have to be supported on the cylinders @xmath17 .",
    "so it suffices , for a contradiction , to show that its mass on each such cylinder is zero .",
    "to do this we use the argument of @xcite ( which in turn relies on @xcite ) slightly modified so as to avoid a technical assumption made there .    finally , in section  [ four ] , we demonstrate @xmath15 for any neighbourhood of the set @xmath37 of conic points of an escs  @xmath11 .",
    "a euclidean surface with conical singularities ( escs ) is a surface @xmath11 equipped with a metric @xmath38 such that @xmath11 may be written @xmath39 where the metric @xmath38 is euclidean on @xmath40 and @xmath37 consists of a finite number of points @xmath41 , such that each @xmath41 has a neighbourhood isometric to a euclidean cone whose tip corresponds to @xmath41 .",
    "a reason for studying the laplace operator on a escs  is its relation with polygonal billiards . indeed , starting from a polygon @xmath0 , possibly with polygonal holes and/or slits , the following doubling procedure gives a escs  @xmath42 take two copies @xmath0 and @xmath43 of the polygon where @xmath44 is a reflection of the plane .",
    "the double @xmath11 is obtained by considering the formal union @xmath45 where two corresponding sides are identified pointwise .",
    "the reflection @xmath44 then gives an involution of @xmath11 that commutes with the laplace operator .",
    "the latter thus decomposes into odd and even functions and the reduced operators are then equivalent to the laplace operator in @xmath37 with dirichlet and neumann boundary condition respectively .",
    "in particular , for any @xmath46 eigenfunction of the neumann , resp .",
    "dirichlet laplace operator in @xmath37 , we can construct an eigenfunction of the laplace operator in @xmath11 by taking @xmath4 in @xmath37 and @xmath47 , resp .",

    "we want to associate to this sequence a so - called _",

[ probmeas ] it should be noted that , in contrast with the usual semiclassical measure , with this definition , a semiclassical measure need not be a probability measure . in order to be a probability measure one has to prove that , loosely speaking , no mass accumulates at the conical points .",
    "the invariance property of this measure by the geodesic flow also has to be taken carefully .",
    "the infinitesimal version of this invariance is true using the standard commutator argument and egorov s theorem since this computation takes place integrally over @xmath50 one can then integrate this property along any geodesic until it reaches a vertex .",

    "necessarily we have @xmath90 we will denote by @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath46 be a sequence of normalized eigenfunctions such that @xmath92 let @xmath35 be any semiclassical measure associated to @xmath32 .",

    "then @xmath133 vanishes near the long sides of @xmath118 , and thus may be regarded as a function on a torus @xmath57 .",

    "this means that @xmath167 .",
    "this implies that @xmath135 has no mass along directions parallel to @xmath82 , which means that @xmath35 has no mass along the cylinder @xmath118 .",
