    "power spectra and cross spectra have been applied widely to study variability in x - ray binaries as a function of frequency and energy , as well as to measure time delays between intensity variations at different energies ( cf .",
    "van der klis 1989 ) . here",
    "we describe the coherence function  a measure of the degree of linear correlation between two time series as a function of fourier frequency  and how this provides strong constraints on models of x - ray binaries , especially recent theoretical models that attempt to correlate energy spectra with aperiodic variability behavior ( cf .",

    "no current model mimics all facets of a system as complex as an x - ray binary . however , spectral and dynamical models should qualitatively reproduce  or at the very least not fundamentally disagree with  _ all _ of their most basic average properties : the energy spectrum , power spectrum ( psd ) , and time delays and coherence between different energies .",
    "( for ways in which a _ spectral _ model can disagree with _ timing _ data , cf .",

    "most theories model the energy spectra , fewer model the psd , fewer still consider phase lags , and , to date , none consider the coherence function . here",
    "we describe several examples that lead to unity coherence , as well as several that generically lead to a loss of coherence .",
    "we apply the coherence function to the black hole candidate   in its low ( hard ) state and   in its very high state .",
    "the former shows unity coherence over a wide range of fourier frequencies and energy bands , whereas the latter shows a sharp drop in coherence between low- and high - energy bands .",
    "we present these data to show the application of the statistical methods to real data , and to show that there are intrinsic differences among distinct physical states and systems .",

    "the fourier transforms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at frequency @xmath4 are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we will usually use lowercase variables to indicate time series and uppercase variables to indicate fourier transforms . from the fourier",
    "transforms one can construct the power spectra [ @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the ( complex - valued ) cross spectrum [ @xmath9 , whose argument is the phase difference between intensity fluctuations in the two channels at frequency @xmath4 which can be converted to a time delay @xmath10/(2\\pi\\nu_j)$ ] .",
    "measured x - ray light curves always contain noise .",
    "for most x - ray observations , the dominant noise source is counting , or poisson , noise .",
    "we denote signal by @xmath11 and noise by @xmath12 , and write @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and likewise for channel 2 . hereafter we usually drop the explicit frequency dependence to simplify notation . for power spectra , poisson noise adds to the signal , and @xmath15 , from the measured power .",
    "we now consider the idealized case of two simultaneous random processes , 1 and 2 , and let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be noiseless signals drawn from these processes .",

    "is then defined as _",
    "i^2(f )  ||^2 , [ gamma_i^2(f ) ] where we affix a subscript @xmath28 when computing the intrinsic coherence between noiseless signals .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath29 and @xmath30 are related by a linear transform , @xmath31 .",
    "coherence is a measure of the fraction of the rms amplitude of one process at a given frequency that can be predicted from the other by a linear transform ( bendat & piersol 1986 ) .",
    "it is important to note that unlike powers and time delays , coherence can only be computed for an ensemble of independent measurements . for noiseless measurements from a finite number , @xmath32 , of independent samples ,",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the coherence function is @xmath33 ( bendat & piersol 1986 ) .",
    "the coherence function of real data is given by analogy to equation  ( [ gamma_i^2(f ) ] ) , except that angle brackets are used to denote an average over a finite number , @xmath32 , of independent measurements .",
    "the coherence function of noisy data will always be less than unity .",
    "the intrinsic coherence can be estimated by correcting each term in the discrete analogy to equation  ( [ gamma_i^2(f ) ] ) for counting noise .",
    "for the powers in the denominator , one sets @xmath34 , and similarly for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the measured , noisy power spectra of the signals .",
    "writing out @xmath38 in terms of signal and noise yields ||^2  =  |+ + + |^2  .",
    "[ long_c ] the first term is the average cross spectrum of the signals .",
    "poisson noise in one channel is uncorrelated with poisson noise in the other channel and with signal in either channel .",
    "thus , @xmath38 is the squared magnitude of the sum of @xmath39 and a complex random variable , @xmath40 , whose real and imaginary parts each have zero mean and variance ( )  =   1 2 ( |s_1|^2|n_2|^2+|n_1|^2|s_2|^2 + |n_1|^2|n_2|^2)/m  .",
    "[ variance ] we define @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the probability distribution of the measured cross spectrum , @xmath38 , given an intrinsic cross spectrum and poisson noise , is equivalent to the distribution of total power in an individual frequency bin of a noisy power spectrum ; it is given by p(a^2|s^2,n^2 )  =  n^-2 i_0(2as ) [ p(a ) ] ( groth 1975 , goodman 1985 ) , where @xmath43 is the zero order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "this can be inverted to yield the probability distribution of @xmath44 given a measured cross spectrum and poisson noise , p(s^2|a^2,n^2)=(ns)^-2 .",
    "[ p(s2 ) ] ( chakrabarty 1996 ) . for @xmath45 , equation  [ p(a ) ] can be approximated by the gaussian p(a^2|s^2,n^2 )   1 , [ approx - p(s ) ] in which case @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "it will often be necessary to correct the poisson noise level for instrumental dead time ( cf .",
    "van der klis 1989 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "dead time can introduce correlations between energy channels that enhance or diminish coherence .",
    "these are intrument dependent and beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "the terms high power and high measured coherence used below denote powers that satisy @xmath52 greater than a few times @xmath53 in each channel and measured coherence that satisfies @xmath54 greater than a few times @xmath55 , respectively . in many cases",

    "[ gamma - high ] this is the gaussian limit , and in essence it corresponds to optimally filtering the measured coherence .",
    "the first three terms in the uncertainty come from uncertainties in poisson noise , and the last term is from the statistical uncertainty in the intrinsic coherence .",

    "the authors do not know a closed form for @xmath61 .",
    "we recommend using equation  ( [ p(s2 ) ] ) and the gaussian probability distributions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 to emperically map out @xmath61 and determine confidence limits on the intrinsic coherence .",

    "thus there is a linear transfer function ( a constant ) between the two channels , and therefore the coherence function will be unity . on the other hand , if @xmath71 and @xmath72 , then we are on the wien tail of the spectrum , in which case we have @xmath73 $ ] . thus there is a nonlinear transfer function . in general",
    ", such a transfer function will take power from a frequency @xmath24 and distribute it among harmonics of @xmath24 ( cf . bendat & piersol 1986 ) and therefore lead to a loss of coherence .",
    "_ multiple flaring regions._a number of models for x - ray variability in galactic black hole candidates associate different timescales with different physical regions of an accretion disk ( cf .",
    "nowak 1994 , miyamoto et al .",
    "if more than one region contributes to the signal in both energy bands , then it is possible for the coherence function to be less than unity , even if _ individual _ regions produce perfectly coherent variability .",
    "consider two flaring regions : one produces a time series @xmath74 , and the other produces a time series @xmath75each in energy bands 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , assume that there is a constant linear transfer function that relates @xmath76 to @xmath77 , as well as another constant , linear transfer function that relates @xmath78 to @xmath79 , with @xmath76 and @xmath78 otherwise being completely uncorrelated .",
    "denoting the intrinsic time series observed in band 1 as @xmath80 , and the intrinsic time series observed in band 2 as @xmath81 , the intrinsic coherence function between the two bands is then ^2_i = q_1 ^ 2 q_2 ^ 2 + r_1 ^ 2 r_2 ^ 2 + 2 | q_1    @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the mean fourier phase differences between @xmath84 and @xmath85 and between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",

    "one can easily show that for this case @xmath88 , and is only equal to unity if both @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "that is to say , the coherence function is unity _ if and only if _ the same linear transfer function that takes @xmath76 to @xmath77 also takes @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "here we present an idealized model that produces unity coherence while producing phase lags qualitatively similar to those seen in cyg x1 ( i.e. phase lags approximately independent of fourier frequency ; miyamoto et al .",
    "imagine that we have a disk with a stochastic source of ( linear ) surface density perturbations at the center that propagate outwards at some constant speed @xmath91 .",
    "if we take the source to be given by @xmath92 , then the resultant surface density perturbations@xmath93 , at radius @xmath94 and time @xmath95 ( using the two - dimensional wave propagation green s function ; cf .",
    "morse & feschbach 1953)are given by _",
    "p ( r , t )  =   dt  _ s(t )   , [ two_d ] where @xmath96 is the step function .",
    "let the fluctuating signal in band 1 , @xmath16 , be equal to the surface density perturbation times a weighting function , @xmath97 , integrated over the entire disk .",
    "the radially integrated green s function is just a linear transfer function , thus the fourier transform of @xmath16 becomes s_1(f )  =   _ s(f )   i 2 ^2  r g_1(r )   h_0^(1 ) ( 2 |f| r )  dr  , [ two_dtrans ] which we define as @xmath98 , and where @xmath99 is the hankel function of @xmath100 as well as the fourier transform of the two - dimensional green s function .",
    "similarly we have @xmath101 .",
    "as both @xmath102 and @xmath103 are linearly related to the source @xmath104 , there is a linear transfer function equal to @xmath105 that takes @xmath102 to @xmath103 , and therefore there is unity coherence .",
    "we could write such a transfer function only because the driving source was separable in time and space ( in this case being spatially localized ) .",
    "equation ( [ two_dtrans ] ) is analytically tractable if we set @xmath106 and @xmath107 , as one might have for weighting functions representing flux from a wien tail . as will be discussed elsewhere ( vaughan et al .",
    "1997 ) , the resulting time lags are qualitatively similar to those seen in cyg x1 .",
    "we require @xmath108 to obtain quantitative agreement with the observations , which implies an extremely slow propagation speed , @xmath109 .",
    "this mechanism is qualitatively similar to that proposed by manmoto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , where thermal waves are launched from large disk radii toward the center , and then reflect from the disk inner edge as acoustic waves .",
    "however , the mechanism of manmoto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) can not preserve coherence if , as in the example of  3 , there are multiple , spatially distributed source functions ( _ in the x - ray - emitting regions _ ) for the waves .",
    "furthermore , the acoustic waves shock upon reflection , which is an inherently non - linear process that also will lead to a loss of coherence , if emission from the reflected shock is an appreciable fraction of the total observed emission .    adding additional mechanisms in the form of successive transfer functions",
    "will lead to unity coherence so long as each component is itself linear . in the above example",
    ", we could have invoked comptonization as a subsequent transfer mechanism , which would have introduced additional time delays .",
    "so long as the compton cloud is static , coherence will be preserved ( cf .",
    "nowak & vaughan 1996 ) .",
    "of the above physical situations where coherence is preserved and those where it is not , which cases are observed in nature ?",
    "surprisingly , the answer seems to be that unity coherence is the norm , despite the variety of ways of weakening coherence .",
    "here we present two black hole candidates : gx3394 in its very high state , and cyg x1 in its low state .",
    "both have been modeled with disks plus compton coronae ( cf .",
    "miyamoto et al . 1991 ; dove , wilms , & begelman 1996 and references therein ) , although there are differences between them : the very high state has a substantial soft ( @xmath110 kev ) component , the low state has none ; the hard tail of the very high state is softer than the hard tail of the low state ( @xmath111 photon index compared to @xmath112 ) ; the very high state has lower variability ( rms @xmath113 ) than the low state ( rms @xmath114 ) . yet , as shown in figure 1 , both systems apparently have unity intrinsic coherence , at least between low energies and at low frequency .",
    "figure 1 presents coherence plots derived from _ ginga _ data .",
    "the methods described above have been used to filter the noise from the data .",
    "poisson noise and uncertainties in the _ ginga _ dead time make the coherence estimates unreliable above @xmath115 hz ; however , at frequencies below 10  hz the intrinsic coherence is essentially unity .",
    "this result holds true for cyg x1 over a wide range of energy channels . on the other hand ,",
    "the gx 3394 variability ( the psd is shown as fig .",
    "_ 4b _ in miyamoto et al . 1991 ) shows unity coherence between low energies but shows a dramatic drop in coherence between the @xmath116 kev and @xmath117 kev channels .",
    "considering the mechanisms discussed above , this loss of coherence is not surprising .",
    "perhaps the @xmath117 kev band corresponds to a wien tale , and , therefore , to a nonlinear transfer function .",
    "it is more difficult to explain the observed unity coherence .",
    "we expect that most shot models ( cf .",
    "lochner et al . 1991 ) will produce less than unity coherence .",
    "for example , the kinematic model of nowak ( 1994 ) for the very high state of gx 3394 successfully reproduced the observed psds and phase lags .",
    "however , as the viscous and thermal fluctuations were distributed over a large range of radii and overlapped in time , the mechanism led to less than unity coherence ( not shown in that paper ) between _ all _ energy bands . in order to preserve coherence",
    ", we always require linear responses , and we usually require the following : localized sources and/or localized responses ; a ( temporally ) uniform source throughout the disk ; or a uniform response throughout the disk .",
    "most of these features are absent from current models .",
    "the data described above will be presented in greater detail in vaughan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . here",
    "we have presented them to demonstrate that there are observational and , by extension , physical differences between the systems , despite the fact that they are both commonly fit with coronae models .",
    "the coherence function therefore offers us another tool to help distinguish among theoretical models .",
    "we have described a statistic , the coherence function , that is derivable from the cross spectrum used to compute phase or time lags between two times series . this statistic has traditionally been ignored ; however , it contains additional information about the system , and the methods described above can minimize the noise effects .",
    "whenever one calculates the phase lag , one can and should also calculate the coherence function .",
    "in general , coherence will be lost whenever there is a nonlinear transfer function between two channels , or whenever there are multiple , uncorrelated ( linear or nonlinear ) transfer functions between two channels .",
    "however , our experience has been that coherence is preserved more often than not .",
    "this is a challenge for theoretical models , as there are many more mechanisms for destroying coherence than there are for preserving coherence .",
    "we presented data from two black hole candidates : gx 3394 in its very high state and cyg x1 in its low state . at low frequency and",
    "low energy both preserve coherence , although gx 3394 loses coherence between high- and low - energy bands .",
    "theoretical models have addressed observations of phase and time lags ( cf .",
    "nowak 1994 , manmoto et al .",
    "1996 , etc . ) , as measured with _",
