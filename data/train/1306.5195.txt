    "a well - known complexity in the determination of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) structure arises in systems with a high symmetry ( e.g. , cubic or tetragonal ) crystal lattice : the issue of whether the magnetic correlations in each afm domain are associated with a single magnetic propagation wave vector axis or with multiple axes;@xcite in other words , whether the domains are single-@xmath1 or multi-@xmath1 .",
    "an illustrative example is depicted in fig .",

    "panel ( a ) shows two - dimensional representations of a pair of orthogonal single-@xmath1 domains ( blue and red arrows ) .",
    "the coherent sum of this pair gives panel ( b ) , a double-@xmath1 domain .",
    "a fictitious diffraction experiment would observe the same principal magnetic satellite reflections from the pair of single-@xmath1 domains as from the double-@xmath1 domain .",
    "thus it is non - trivial to distinguish between these two ordering scenarios , and the same applies when comparing ( in three - dimensions ) other domain possibilities .",
    "knowledge of the single- or multi-@xmath1 nature of afm ordering is important in different areas of condensed matter physics , e.g. , in unconventional superconductivity@xcite and in the understanding of spin - wave dynamics,@xcite as well as in the study of multiferroics.@xcite     and ( b ) double-@xmath1 representations of afm order associated with a commensurate ( principal ) propagation wave vector , of magnitude @xmath1 = 0.5 reciprocal lattice units .",
    "the arrows represent ordered magnetic moments positioned in a square array .",
    "the lattice parameter is the separation between two adjacent moments . ]    traditionally the question as to the single- versus multi-@xmath1 nature of the afm domains in high symmetry systems has been addressed by examining , via neutron diffraction , a single - crystal specimen s response to an external perturbation ( applied magnetic field or uniaxial stress ) that lifts the magnetic degeneracy of symmetry equivalent crystallographic directions.@xcite more recently , other scattering approaches that do _ not _ involve an applied perturbation were shown capable , in certain circumstances , of determining the afm domain nature.@xcite in the present study we evidence double-@xmath1 afm ordering in a tetragonal crystal system ( gdni@xmath0b@xmath0c ) , achieving this result without perturbing the system and through an approach different from those in refs . .",
    "our motivation to study gdni@xmath0b@xmath0c is threefold : ( i ) it is justified by the ongoing interest in the rare - earth quaternary borocarbides , which , apart from the well - known superconductivity - magnetism interplay,@xcite stems from magnetic phenomena in the family that are interesting in their own right;@xcite ( ii ) we test a state of the art magnetic structure calculation for rare - earth based antiferromagnets in which the spin ( s ) is the only contribution to the local magnetic moment;@xcite ( iii ) [ and concomitant with ( ii ) ] we address a paradox@xcite found in such ( 4@xmath7 ) antiferromagnets .",
    "the paradox is as follows .",
    "a 4@xmath7 spin - only system is understood to lack strong single - ion anisotropies derived from crystal fields,@xcite and with complexities arising from such anisotropies removed coupled with weak hybridization of the spin polarized electrons with ligand or conduction electrons , the standard model of rare earth magnetism@xcite is expected to provide an accurate description of experiment . however , in several such ( 4@xmath7 ) systems one would expect lattice distortions below their afm ordering temperatures ( nel temperatures , t@xmath8 ) and such distortions are _ not _ found experimentally in zero applied magnetic field ( h = 0 ) .",
    "the term `` magnetoelastic ( me ) paradox '' was coined to refer to this inconsistency between experiment and expectation.@xcite    the expectation of a lattice distortion follows from anticipating the effect of exchange striction ( a major component in the standard model@xcite and of importance in fields such as multiferroics@xcite ) in each of the experimentally concluded afm structures.@xcite several gd@xmath9 systems ( j = s = 7/2 , l = 0 ) , including gdni@xmath0b@xmath0c , present the me paradox , i.e. , the experimentally concluded afm structures are of lower space group symmetry than the lattices , however , the lattices do _ not _ distort to the lower symmetry.@xcite in order to alleviate the me paradox in gdni@xmath0b@xmath0c , jensen and rotter undertook model calculations from which they proposed@xcite a double-@xmath1 magnetic structure with tetragonal symmetry ( similar to the lattice ) and thus different from the structure concluded from previous scattering studies@xcite on gdni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "such double-@xmath1 ordering can be reconciled with the results from the previous scattering studies as being essentially a coherent superposition of the two previously concluded single-@xmath1 domains.@xcite in the present study we employ resonant elastic x - ray scattering ( rexs ) to re - examine the magnetic structure of gdni@xmath0b@xmath0c , paying particular attention to the possibility of double-@xmath1 ordering as predicted by jensen and rotter.@xcite      gdni@xmath0b@xmath0c crystallizes in the tetragonal space group i4/mmm ( # 139 ) , with lattice parameters @xmath5 = @xmath6 = 3.57  and @xmath10 = 10.37  .",
