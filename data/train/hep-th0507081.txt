    "this article is the second in a series that develops a renormalizable effective theory description of the initial state for inflation . the first article @xcite described the construction of an effective initial state in minkowski space while this one generalizes the setting to an isotropically expanding space - time .",
    "the main idea is to establish a perturbative description of the signals of new physics as it affects the short - distance structure of the state , showing explicitly how any divergences associated with this short - distance structure are renormalized .    the accelerated expansion of the universe during inflation @xcite produces an extremely rapid growth in the size of a causally connected region while at the same time the hubble size remains essentially unchanged .",
    "the exact amount of expansion depends upon the details of the inflationary model , but with 6070 @xmath0-folds of inflation , the entire universe seen today could have grown from a single , suitably small , causally connected region .",
    "this mechanism can explain the extreme uniformity of the universe observed on large scales or at early times , but even more importantly , inflation also predicts a tiny departure from perfect homogeneity caused by quantum fluctuations which are similarly stretched to vast scales .",
    "the spectrum of these fluctuations is exactly the form of the synchronized acoustic oscillations which have been measured precisely by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite .",
    "most models for inflation have no difficulty in producing the required amount of inflation .",
    "typically they produce substantially more and as a consequence the structures on the largest cosmological scales today would have had their origin in quantum fluctuations which occurred at sub - planckian lengths during inflation .",
    "this peculiar feature of inflation , its `` trans - planckian problem '' @xcite , suggests the possibility that extremely short - distance physics , well beyond that currently accessible in accelerator experiments , could be imprinted on the very largest of observable scales .",
    "although the term suggests physics above the planck scale , here we shall generally refer to _ any _ sort of new physics sufficiently above the hubble scale during inflation as `` trans - planckian . ''    with this opportunity and with the prospect of significantly better measurements of the cosmic microwave background and the large scale structure , it is increasingly important to have an accurate estimate of the generic trans - planckian signal .",
    "one approach for determining this signal is to choose a specific model for what happens above the planck scale and then to calculate its corrections to the primordial fluctuation spectrum @xcite .",
    "such models have been very useful in providing an estimate of the typical size for the trans - planckian signal .",
    "however , the details of a particular model may have relatively little motivation from lower energy phenomenology or might simply not correspond to what actually occurs in nature .",
    "a second approach does not attempt to form a complete picture of the physics above the planck scale , but rather seeks to develop an effective theory description of its signal @xcite .",
    "any new physics near the planck scale first appears as a generic set of effects during inflation which are specified by a small number of parameters . while they assume specific values in any particular model for the new physics , to a low energy observer they simply appear as free parameters to be fixed experimentally .",
    "the effective approach is based on a perturbative expansion that uses the smallness of the ratio of the two natural scales@xmath1 , the hubble scale during inflation , and @xmath2 , the scale associated with the possible new physics .",
    "if the signal is suppressed only by @xmath3 , it could well be observable either by future cosmic microwave satellites such as planck @xcite or , still more likely , by future surveys @xcite of the large scale structure , which traces the same primordial fluctuations .    from the perspective of the effective theory principle",
    ", new physics can appear in either the time evolution of the inflaton and its fluctuations or in their `` initial '' states .",
    "the first of these  how the system evolves  is more familiar since the evolution of the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton is determined by its interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the form of the general set of possible corrections that we can add to this hamiltonian , encoding the effects of the unknown physics , is rather constrained by the space - time symmetries . given these constraints , the size of the corrections from the unknown physics relative to the leading prediction for an inflationary model is usually suppressed by a factor of @xmath4 @xcite . the other ingredient  the state of the inflaton  is more directly related to the trans - planckian problem because it is the details of the initial state we have chosen which are being stretched to vast scales . the leading correction from these effects is typically much less suppressed , scaling instead as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the standard view is that the correct state to choose is the vacuum state . in an expanding background",
    ", this vacuum corresponds to the maximally symmetric state that matches with the minkowski space vacuum at very short distances , where the curvature of the space - time should be negligible .",
    "this requirement is made so that when a quantum field theory is placed in a curved background , it inherits the same renormalizability it had in minkowski space , although its behavior can be quite different on large scales .    despite the apparent simplicity of this view",
    ", it contains an inherent ambiguity .",
    "even in minkowski space , there is no reason to trust that the vacuum , defined in terms of the eigenstates of a low energy effective theory , has the correct structure when extrapolated to arbitrarily short distances .",
    "the true vacuum , determined by the eigenstates of the complete theory , most likely departs from a perfect agreement with the extrapolated low energy vacuum on sufficiently small scales .",
    "an effective theory description of an initial state then provides a method for characterizing these departures such that they only have a small effect on long - distance measurements and moreover do not lead to any uncontrolled divergences which would prevent a perturbative calculation @xcite .",
    "the effective theory principle @xcite provides a powerful prescription for understanding some phenomena over a limited range of length or energy scales , while at the same time parameterizing the possible leading signals of unknown physics that lies just beyond those scales . for a quantum field theory propagating through the bulk of space - time , this idea is implemented by first identifying all of the observed fields and symmetries of a physical system and then constructing all possible operators out of these fields that are invariant under all of the symmetries . a finite , and usually small ,",
    "subset of these operators describes the theory well at very large distances , or equivalently at low energies .",
    "the remaining infinite set of operators represents the generic signal of the hidden degrees of freedom whose dynamics are associated with a much smaller characteristic length , @xmath5 .",
    "what makes the theory calculable at low energies , @xmath6 , is that all of the operators in this second set are naturally suppressed by some @xmath7 power of @xmath8 , with only a finite number appearing at each order @xmath9 . for an experiment conducted at an energy @xmath10 and which measures an observable to an accuracy @xmath11 ,",
    "we need only include the set of operators whose order @xmath9 satisfies @xmath12 when an experiment finally probes energies of the order @xmath13 , where the effective theory becomes nonpredictive , it uncovers the hidden degrees of freedom and their symmetries and the original effective theory is replaced by a new effective theory including these new fields which is applicable up to some still higher energy .",
    "the point of an effective description of an initial state is similarly to divide the aspects of a state into components which are important either at long or at short distances .",
    "a state constructed only from the former agrees with the standard vacuum at arbitrarily short distances . yet even for such states ,",
    "if the difference between the actual state and the standard vacuum diminishes sufficiently slowly , some new divergences appear in the perturbative corrections .",
    "these divergences only occur at the initial time , precisely where the state was defined , and so must be cancelled by adding new counterterms , localized at the initial boundary , which are marginal or relevant according to a boundary action .",
    "the short - distance components , which contain the effects of trans - planckian physics , describe states which diverge from the standard vacuum at distances below @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior is completely consistent as an effective theory and only produces initial - time divergences which are cancelled by adding irrelevant counterterms to the boundary action . as with the standard setting for an effective theory , for a measurement at low energies , which for inflation corresponds to the hubble scale @xmath1 ,",
    "the effects of the trans - planckian components of the state are suppressed by powers of @xmath3 leading to a completely predictive theory .",
    "an effective theory of any form is always inherently applicable only up to a particular energy scale . in an expanding background ,",
    "this property also sets a limit to the earliest possible time at which it can be applied while still remaining perturbative @xcite .",
    "while this limit implies that we should choose our `` initial '' state no earlier than that time at which redshifting would undo the suppression of the ratio @xmath3 , it also implies that we should not use a formalism , such as the @xmath14-matrix , which would require integrating over any times earlier than this initial time .",
    "what underlies the success of an overall space - time view such as the @xmath14-matrix in minkowski space is that scales do not alter over time .",
    "if we define some departure between the standard vacuum and the true vacuum at some very small scale in an asymptotic past , that scale remains unchanged during the period when the parts of the system interact and further on into some asymptotic future .",
    "in contrast , with the continuous stretching of scales during inflation , it is not possible to apply a such an overall space - time view since the asymptotic states would need to be defined in a regime where all the features responsible for the shape of the microwave background would have been infinitesimally smaller than the planck scale .",
    "instead , the correct approach is to use the hamiltonian to evolve the entire system continuously forward , starting from a state defined at an appropriate initial time @xcite .",
    "the next section begins by describing how to set the initial state in a robertston - walker space - time by using a boundary condition specified along a spacelike surface . to renormalize the theory",
    ", it is important to extract the exact behavior at asymptotically short distances , which is accomplished here by applying an adiabatic expansion for the state . for a full time - dependent description of the effects of a general initial state",
    ", the theory must describe how the information in this initial state propagates forward , so in sec .",
    "[ prop ] we construct a propagator which is also consistent with the initial boundary condition .",
    "our ultimate interest is to calculate the generic trans - planckian signal in the microwave background @xcite which , although a tree - level calculation , implicitly assumes that perturbative corrections are small and finite .",
    "it is therefore necessary to establish the renormalizability of the the theory for a general initial condition .",
    "this calculation begins in sec .",

    "[ boundary ] , which shows how the renormalizable and nonrenormalizable classes of initial conditions are associated with relevant or irrelevant boundary counterterms respectively .",
    "we also show how the standard callan - symanzik equation applies also to the running of the initial conditions .",
    "section  [ conclude ] concludes with a brief outline of how initial state effects must be treated to address correctly the question of back - reaction as well as to calculate the expected trans - planckian signal in the primordial power spectrum .",

    "and the scalar curvature corresponds to @xmath18 . ] on very large scales or at early times , the universe appears highly homogeneous and isotropic so we shall consider backgrounds where the metric only depends on time , @xmath19 although the setting can be readily generalized to less symmetric backgrounds as well .",
    "this general robertson - walker metric can also be expressed in a conformally flat form , @xmath20 ,   \\label{frwmetric}\\ ] ] by defining a conformal time with @xmath21 and setting @xmath22 .",
    "we shall work in this conformal coordinate system since the conformal time has a useful physical interpretation . in units where @xmath23 , the conformal time corresponds to the distance traveled by a massless particle since the earliest of times .",
    "thus , simultaneous points separated by a spatial distance greater than @xmath24 were never in causal contact . the conformal time is moreover used in the standard inflationary calculations of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "the simplest curved background of this robertson - walker form is de sitter space , @xmath25 the curvature of de sitter space is everywhere constant , @xmath26 , so that in this case the mass term and the curvature term in the action are redundant and the curvature term can be absorbed by a suitable rescaling of the mass .",
    "de sitter space is sometimes used as an idealization of the conditions expected to occur during inflation , where the background curvature , while not constant , varies only slowly over time .",
    "we shall consider here a completely general isotropically expanding background .",

    "summing over this arbitrarily large momentum behavior , or equivalently the short - distance features of the theory , can produce divergences .",

    "since they are associated with the structure of the initial state , this class of divergences is localized at the initial time @xcite and they are removed by renormalizing the theory at this initial boundary .",

    "<S> we examine the renormalization of an effective theory description of a general initial state set in an isotropically expanding space - time , which is done to understand how to include the effects of new physics in the calculation of the cosmic microwave background power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the divergences that arise in a perturbative treatment of the theory are of two forms : those associated with the properties of a field propagating through the bulk of space - time , which are unaffected by the choice of the initial state , and those that result from summing over the short - distance structure of the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the former have the same renormalization and produce the same subsequent scale dependence as for the standard vacuum state , while the latter correspond to divergences that are localized at precisely the initial time hypersurface on which the state is defined . this class of divergences is therefore renormalized by adding initial - boundary counterterms , which render all of the perturbative corrections small and finite . </S>",
    "<S> initial states that approach the standard vacuum at short distances require , at worst , relevant or marginal boundary counterterms . </S>",
    "<S> states that differ from the vacuum at distances below that at which any new , potentially trans - planckian , physics becomes important are renormalized with irrelevant boundary counterterms . </S>"
