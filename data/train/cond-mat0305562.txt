    "an interesting effect recently observed is that the resistance of a microwave irradiated two dimensional system ( 2des ) in a magnetic field @xmath1 drops almost to zero in certain intervals of @xmath1 @xcite . in magnetic fields too low for the observation of shubnikov - de haas oscillations ( @xmath2 ) the resistance @xmath3 of a 2des with mobility @xmath4 begins to oscillate in the presence of microwave irradiation @xcite . in samples with higher mobility",
    "( @xmath5 the resistance oscillations become more pronounced and the resistance drops almost to zero in some intervals of @xmath1 @xcite lower than the fields at whichshubnikov - de haas oscillations begin to appear .",
    "sometimes the states of the 2des with almost zero resistance are called the zero resistance state ( zrs ) .",
    "these states have been observed in experiments on hall bars @xcite .",
    "similar measurements have been recently carried out on corbino discs @xcite . in this case",
    "a zero conductance state rather than the zrs has been observed in the same intervals of the applied magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "these experiments have drawn considerable attention , and during a short period of time many papers appeared where possible mechanisms for the observed effects were suggested @xcite .",
    "the most adequate mechanism seems to be the one based on the idea of absolute negative conductance ( anc ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a microwave irradiated 2des in a strong magnetic field ( @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath8 is the momentum relaxation time ) may have absolute negative conductance @xmath9 . in some papers",
    "the calculations were carried out for a small bias electric field @xmath10 ( a linear response ) . in refs . @xcite the dependence @xmath11 was discussed and the conclusion was made that the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath13 may have a n - shape form ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite assumed that the function @xmath14 has the n - shape form and showed that the states with negative differential conductance ( ndc ) are unstable with respect to small perturbations . as a result of this instability",
    ", a nonuniform distribution of the current density is assumed to arise and current domains ( or current filaments ) should appear in the sample . in this state",
    "the field @xmath13 is zero and a change in the total current leads for example to an enlargement of the domain with positive current and to a shrinking of the domain with negative current ( the zrs ) .",
    "the possibility of a microwave induced anc in semiconductors in a quantizing magnetic field was suggested and discussed some decades  ago @xcite . around the same time phenomena in semiconductors with n- and",
    "s - shape @xmath15 characteristic were studied inensively both experimentally and theoretically ( see the review article @xcite and the book @xcite and references therein ) . in particiular , it was shown that in semiconductors with the n - shape @xmath15 characteristic generally speaking moving domains of the electric field arise as a result of the instability of a state with the ndc . in semiconductors with the s - shape @xmath16 characteristics , domains ( filaments ) of the current density",
    "arise as a result of the instability . in the presence of the electric or current domains",
    "the @xmath15 characteristic changes drastically . in the first case",
    "an almost horizontal section appears on the @xmath15 characteristics ( zero differential conductance ) , whereas an almost vertical section appears on the @xmath15 curve in the second case ( zero differential resistance ) .",
    "if a system with s- or n - shape @xmath15 characteristic is placed in a magnetic field , the situation becomes more complicated : the form of the @xmath15 curve now depends on the measurement geometry ( hall bar or corbino disc ) @xcite and both electric field and current domains may coexist .",
    "for example , if one assumes the n - shape form for @xmath17 dependence on @xmath13 in a corbino disc ( @xmath18 ) , then in the hall bar measurements with increasing magnetic field the dependence @xmath19 acquires a complicated form becoming s - shaped at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , equations for macroscopic parameters ( electric field , electron density etc ) corresponding to experimental samples @xcite are not yet derived . in the recent paper @xcite a kinetic equation for the distribution function",
    "is derived which , in principle , could be applied to describe nonhomogeneous states .",
    "however this task is very difficult .",
    "all previous publications on these nonhomogeneous states are based on equations for macroscopic parameters .",
    "therefore , although the dependence of the zrs or zcs on the applied magnetic field @xmath1 obtained theoretically @xcite qualitatively agrees with experimental results @xcite , it is difficult to convincingly conclude that the observed zrs or zcs are the result of instability of an uniform state in the 2des with the s- or n - shape @xmath15 curve .",
    "nevertheless even a phenomenological model of the s- or n - shape characteristics allows one to make certain conclusions about the observed @xmath21 curves . in this paper",
    "we admit a phenomenological model assuming a n - shape @xmath15 curve in the corbino disc geometry and calculate the residual resistance ( hall bar experiments ) or conductance ( corbino disc experiments ) .",
    "we show that in our model this resistance ( conductance ) depends exponentially on the ratio of the width of the sample to the width of the domain wall .",
    "although our model does not correspond to the parameters of the real samples used in experiments @xcite , it has a physical meaning and allows us to make general statements about the stability of the system , the form of electric and current domains and the residual resistance of the system in a nonuniform state .",
    "in particular using model one can answer the question whether the state observed in experiments is dissipationless ( as it happens in superconductivity and was anticipated in ref.@xcite ) or not .",
    "as in ref.@xcite , we assume that @xmath9 depends on the electric field @xmath22 so that in the absence of @xmath23 ( the corbino disc ) the dependence @xmath24 on @xmath13 has an n - shape form ( see fig.1 ) . such a dependence was discussed in ref.@xcite(see also @xcite ) . for example , this dependence may be obtained if we take for @xmath25 the expression    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the conductance in strong fields ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 and @xmath25 equals zero at the field @xmath30 * the electric field * @xmath31 *  as well as the conductivity * @xmath32 *  should be determined from a microscopic theory ( see refs.@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for example , according to ref.@xcite on the order of magnitude * @xmath33 *  * @xmath34 @xmath35 . in order to describe the form of domains , one has to know a microscopic mechanism which determines the form of the @xmath15 curve .",
    "for example in refs.@xcite a superheating mechanism of the s - shape current - voltage characteristic was considered . in this case",
    "the width of the current domains is determined by the energy relaxation length .",
    "we assume that in our model a characteristic length is determined by the screening length ( such a model was used to describe the gunn effect @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the current density can be written as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the conductivity tensor with diagonal components equal to @xmath38 @xmath39 and off - diagonal ones equal to @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the diffusion coefficient tensor which has a similar structure .",
    "the last term is the displacement current .",
    "we assume that only @xmath42 depends on the field @xmath10 . the components @xmath43 and @xmath44 are assumed to be independent of @xmath10 .",
    "* at first glance the assumption about independence of the diffusion coefficient on * @xmath10 *  violates the einstein relation between the mobility and diffusion constant .",
    "however this relation holds only for systems in equilibrium .",
    "this is not the case for the system under consideration .",
    "of course the diffusion coefficient * @xmath45 *  depends on * @xmath10 *  in some ( unknown in our phenomenological appoach ) way .",
    "this dependence can be taken into account if we introduce a new  potential  in eq.(6 ) or a new electric field .",
    "therefore a corresponding analysis for the case of the energy dependent diffusion coefficient * @xmath46 * can be carried out in a similar way as for the constant * @xmath47 * for simlicity we ignore this dependence because it does not lead to qualitatively new results .",
    "note that an analogous problem was discussed in the theory of the gunn effect ( see the reviews * @xcite * and references therein ) . *",
    "the electron concentration @xmath48 is related to the electric field via the poisson equation ( instead of -e we write + e making a proper choice of the electric field direction )    @xmath49    we also assume that the thickness of the 2des @xmath50 is larger ( or of the order ) than the screening length @xmath51 . in this case in order to find a relation between @xmath48 and @xmath52 , one has to solve eq.([poisson ] ) inside the sample .",
    "otherwise one has to solve an equation for the electric field ( or potential ) outside the sample taking into account corresponding boundary conditions . in the case",
    "@xmath53 eqs.([current],[poisson ] ) yield correct results at least qualitatively .",
    "the main drawback of our model is the assumption of a local relationship between the current density @xmath54 and electric field @xmath52 which is true if the mean free path @xmath55 is shorter than a characteristic length of the problem ( in our case the screening length ) . in the experiments one has the opposite relationship between @xmath51 and @xmath56    = 5 cm",
    "let us consider first the simplest case of the corbino disc geometry when @xmath57 ( see fig.2a ) .",
    "= 5 cm    eqs.([current],[poisson ] ) can be rewritten in this case as follows    @xmath58    @xmath59    these equations practically coincide with equations used in the theory of the gunn effect @xcite . linearizing these equations with respect to small fluctuations @xmath60 , one can easily show that states with negative differential conductance are unstable : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the @xmath15 characteristic in an uniform case .",
    "this dispersion relation shows that the states with negative differential conductance are unstable with respect to long - wave perturbations .",
    "the characteristic length of the problem ( the width of a domain wall ) is determined by the relation : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the differential conductance .",
    "the conclusion on the instability of the states with a negative differential conductance was made a long time ago ( see refs @xcite ) . as a result of",
    "the instability , domains of the electric field ( in the x - direction ) arise in the sample . in the y - direction",
    "these domains may be regarded as the current density filaments : different hall currents flow in domains with opposite directions of the electric fields . in order to find the form of the domains of the electric field @xmath10",
    ", we exclude @xmath48 from eqs.([current],[poisson ] ) and arrive at the equation    @xmath65    here @xmath66 is the normalised electric field , @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the characteristic screening length , @xmath69 @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",

    ", we neglect the last term in eq.([geneq ] ) . in the following",
    "the analysis is similar to that presented in ref .",
    ". we integrate eq.([geneq ] ) and obtain the  energy  conservation law which describes the phase trajectories    @xmath85    the integration constant @xmath86 determines the phase trajectory ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "its choice depends on concrete boundary conditions .",
    "we assume that at the boundaries @xmath87 the spatial derivates @xmath88 is zero ( the final result does not depend qualitatively on particular boundary conditions ) .",
    "we are interested in a solution of the form of two domains with opposite electric fields .",
    "the field @xmath89 is connected with the length of the sample @xmath90 by the relation    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the distance between the outer and inner radious of the corbino disc .",
    "the constant @xmath93 is connected with @xmath94 by the equation    @xmath95    = 5 cm    our goal is to find a relation between the averaged field in the sample @xmath96 with the bias current @xmath97 the relation @xmath98 is the form of the current - voltage characteristic in the presence of domains .",
    "the averaged field @xmath99 is given by    @xmath100    the equations ( [ length],[e2],[ave ] ) determines the @xmath98 characteristic , or the residual conductance in the presence of domains .",
    "the function @xmath101 in these equations is shown in fig.3 ( solid line ) .",
    "it is clear that if the characteristic width of the domain wall ( in our model @xmath51 ) is much less than the length @xmath90 , the trajectory @xmath101 should be close to the dash - dotted trajectory ( the soliton trajectory ) .",

    ". therefore the assumed smallness of @xmath124  is justified .",
    "the formula ( [ resg ] ) is valid if the condition ( [ eq4 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "this condition can be represented in the form    @xmath125    the formula ( [ resg ] ) shows that the residual conductance is small ( we assumed that @xmath126 ) and exponentially decreases with increasing length @xmath90 . note that in a model more appropriate to the real experimements @xcite the characteristic length might differ from the screening length @xmath51 . if @xmath127 exceeds the value of the characteristic field in the rhs of eq.([eq4a ] ) , the residual conductance increases exponentially .",
    "note that the obtained nonhomogeneous state with a negative differential conductance is stable if the total voltage is fixed ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in this section we consider the case of the hall bar geometry ( see fig.2b ) . in this case",
    "we have to write the equations for the currents @xmath128 having in mind that all quantities depend on @xmath129    @xmath130    @xmath131    taking into account the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) and the fact that @xmath132 we obtain    @xmath133    @xmath134    here @xmath135 is the bias current density which depends on @xmath129 , @xmath136 the conductivity @xmath137 because we assume that @xmath138 , and therefore @xmath139 as before we neglect small terms of the order @xmath140 the form of domains is determined by eq.([currentya ] ) that coincides with eq.([geneq ] ) if the latter small term  in eq.([geneq ] ) is neglected .",
