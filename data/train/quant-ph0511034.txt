    "geometric phases and entangled states have been two of the most addressed issues during the last few years .",
    "the widespread interest on these topics embraces both theoretical and applied aspects . since the appearance of berry s seminal paper @xcite ,",
    "different geometric phases have been theoretically introduced and experimentally tested . due to some subtleties that are inherent to the above mentioned topics",
    ", the introduction of a new phase and/or its experimental demonstration eventually causes some controversy and it may take some time before an issue becomes settled .",
    "this usually requires seeing one and the same topic from different perspectives .",
    "it is in this vein that the present article deals with a topological phase recently proposed by milman and mosseri @xcite .",
    "these authors discussed a quantum optics interference experiment designed to demonstrate a topological phase shift , which should stem from the subtleties of the @xmath0 rotation group topology .",
    "milman and mosseri claim that by using two - qubit , maximally entangled states ( mes ) the double connectedness of the @xmath0 rotation group can be displayed .",
    "their proposal is based on a one - to - one map between @xmath0 and the set of two - qubit mes .",
    "these states can be currently produced as , e.g. , polarization - entangled photon pairs by using a down converter @xcite . in order to measure the topological phase , one of the photons from the entangled pair is sent through a mach - zehnder interferometer , at whose output it is detected in coincidence with the other photon from the entangled pair , which serves as the reference mode . in one of the arms of the mach - zehnder interferometer",
    "a variable dephasing @xmath4 is introduced .",
    "the goal is to bring into evidence that there are two classes of trajectories in @xmath0 , as followed by the mes when they are subjected to the transformations due to different devices that constitute the optical system ( beam - splitters , wave plates , mirrors , etc . ) . as a result , the counting rate for coincidence detections at two detectors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , put at the output ports of the interferometer ,",
    "is given by @xmath7 . here",
    ", @xmath8 counts the number of times that the trajectory breaks on the surface of the @xmath0 sphere , on which such trajectories can be represented . in a sequel to ref .",
    "@xcite , liming , tang and liao @xcite refine the proposal of milman and mosseri , by showing how to realize a larger family of closed trajectories , in which the sudden jumps of the original proposal are replaced by a continuously changing path .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 can have odd and even values beyond the two only cases , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , that milman and mosseri had considered .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the proposed experiments have not yet been implemented .",
    "one goal of the present work is to discuss the extent to which the proposal of milman and mosseri , or that of liming , tang and liao , would imply the appearance of a new phase . around three decades ago a series of experiments in neutron interferometry were performed @xcite , whose aim was to bring into evidence the @xmath11-phase that arises when a spinor is subjected to a @xmath12 rotation .",
    "such a @xmath11-phase illustrates one of the most salient features characterizing the interplay between the groups @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "the advent of quantum optics allowed not only to extend our capability to perform new experiments on this line , but helped also to interpret the old experiments in the framework of entangled states . in this work we present an alternative interpretation of experiments similar to those proposed by milman and mosseri and liming , tang and liao . to this end , we re - analyze the neutron experiments by employing the tools of quantum optics , thereby recovering the known results but at the same time extending their scope .",
    "though we refer specifically to neutron experiments , our results are valid for experiments that can be performed in quantum optics .",
    "only minor changes are needed to obtain the corresponding predictions when one works with photons instead of dealing with fermions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the evolution of maximally entangled states in connection with the @xmath3 group .",
    "we briefly discuss those features concerning the double connectedness of @xmath0 , which are relevant for our case .",
    "a more detailed discussion , including some technical details of @xmath0 has been included in the appendix .",
    "this appendix should serve to make the present paper more self contained . in the next section",
    "we discuss neutron interferometry by means of a full quantum - mechanical treatment .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to stress the essential role played by entangled states in this context .",
    "we analyze in detail how the @xmath11-phase arises and compare our approach with another , newly proposed one , that makes use of the geometrical phase for mixed states .",
    "we then discuss the basic experimental arrangement - a mach - zehnder interferometer - necessary to bring into evidence those features of the @xmath13 group that have been on the focus of our interest .",
    "we summarize our results at the end of the paper and make some conclusions regarding the novelty of the recent proposals .",
    "two - qubit mes are given by    @xmath14    with @xmath15 . following milman and mosseri we define the `` hilbert space of all mes '' as @xmath16 .",
    "first of all , let us note that what we obtain as a consequence of the identification @xmath17 is the well known two - to - one homomorphism between @xmath3 @xmath18 and @xmath0 @xmath19 . our main purpose here is to elucidate whether the mathematical construction leading to @xmath20 has a corresponding physical realization or not .",
    "the key point is the identification @xmath21 .",
    "it certainly reflects the physical indistinguishability between the states @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we note that , in general , @xmath24 , so that one could expect that the production of mes in the laboratory automatically leads to a physical realization of @xmath20 .",
    "however , considering the experimental production of mes , we realize that what we can produce in the laboratory are states whose global phase remains undetermined .",
    "this means that not only @xmath25 and @xmath26 are experimentally indistinguishable , but also @xmath22 and any other state of the form @xmath27 .",
    "thus , instead of @xmath20 , and because the set whose elements are the factors @xmath28 is nothing but @xmath29 @xmath30 , what we actually produce in the laboratory seems to be rather akin to a realization of the hopf - fibration @xcite @xmath31 , by which the @xmath3 manifold @xmath32 is locally decomposed in the form of products of @xmath33-elements @xmath34 by elements @xmath28 of the fiber @xmath35 . the precise way in which such a realization can be established is however not a matter of our concern here . for our purposes",
    ", it should suffice to point out that experimentally realizable mes are defined up to a global phase and can be put in one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath3 elements .",
    "indeed , mes given by eq.([1 ] ) with @xmath36 can also be represented in matrix form as    @xmath37    leaving aside the normalization factor @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 has thus the form of a general @xmath3-matrix .",
    "it is well known that any hamiltonian of a two - level system can be written in a form that corresponds to the interaction of a spin-@xmath2 particle with a magnetic field : @xmath40 . if such a hamiltonian drives the evolution of one of the two qubits in eq.([1 ] )",
    ", the result is an evolved , two - qubit state @xmath41 that remains a mes .",
    "let us first restrict ourselves to the case of a field having a constant direction @xmath42 .",
    "when @xmath43 acts on the first qubit , the evolved state @xmath44 can be obtained from the initial state @xmath45 as    @xmath46    whereby the first matrix on the right - hand side corresponds to the evolution operator @xmath47 acting on the first qubit .",
    "one finds that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given by just the same elements of @xmath50 :    @xmath51 a similar expression can be obtained for the case when it is the second qubit the one which is subjected to the action of the hamiltonian . in such a case",
    ", @xmath52 is given by a relation similar to eq.([3 ] ) , but involving @xmath53 , the transpose of @xmath50 :    @xmath54    as we see , the two evolutions bring an initial @xmath3-element into another one , so that maximal entanglement is preserved .",
    "this is so because all the involved matrices , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , are elements of @xmath3 and by multiplying two of them what we obtain is just another element of the same group .",
    "each matrix @xmath58 can be seen as the result of applying a rotation @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 to the identity matrix @xmath62 , which corresponds to the state @xmath63 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath55 can be identified with the rotation @xmath64 .",
    "this way , two - qubit mes span just another representation - space for rotations . using it",
    "we obtain a representation which is isomorphic to the usual , one - qubit , @xmath3 spinor representation . for closed trajectories a @xmath11-phase might arise : e.g. , when @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 .",
    "this phase can only be @xcite , of course , a relative phase between two states ( e.g. , light beams ) , whereby one of the states is taken as a reference state . by making the two beams",
    "interfere we can bring the @xmath11-phase into evidence .",
    "this was the aim of the classical experiments in neutron interferometry which were developed in the past @xcite .",
    "in the following section we shall discuss these experiments in the framework of maximally entangled states , so as to bring to the fore those features that the classical experiments have in common with the newly proposed ones .",
    "however , before going into the analysis of the neutron experiments , it seems worthwhile to briefly discuss those general matters related to the @xmath0 double connectedness that have prompted some recent proposals , like the ones referred to above @xcite .",
    "this will also set the stage for the discussion that follows .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the @xmath0 double connectedness and related issues has been included in the appendix .",
    "the double connectedness of @xmath0 refers to the fact that not every closed curve in the @xmath0 parameter space can be continuously deformed to a single point at the origin , which is the point representing the identity transformation .",
    "in other words , not every closed curve in @xmath0 is homotopically equivalent to a point .",
    "the curves which are homotopic to the identity belong to one homotopy class .",
    "the curves which are not homotopic to the identity belong to a second homotopy class .",
    "it happens that @xmath0 has only two homotopy classes .",
    "now , if we take an object and apply to it a sequence of @xmath0 transformations which begin and end at the identity , we can not tell - by just observing the object - which homotopy class the sequence belongs to . in order to identify the homotopy class we need to map the sequence of transformations into elements of @xmath3 , the simply connected group which shares with @xmath0 the same lie algebra . for each element of @xmath0",
    "there are two elements of @xmath3 that can be mapped on it .",
    "such a map allows us to disclose the double connectedness of @xmath0 .",
    "these topics are discussed in more detail in the appendix .",
    "here , it should be enough to stress that in order to disclose the double connectedness of @xmath13 we do need an object on which to apply the corresponding @xmath3 transformations .",
    "of course , such an object is nothing but a spin-@xmath2 particle or any other two - level system . we can not remain working with @xmath0 transformations or with objects on which these transformations apply , if we aim at disclosing the subtleties of the @xmath0 topology .",
    "if that would be possible , a rigid body would suffice .",
    "thus , the essential point concerning mes is not that they could be put in one - to - one correspondence with a set of @xmath67-dimensional rotation matrices - which is true for rigid bodies - , but that mes entail two - level systems on which we can apply @xmath3 transformations . in order to disclose the subtleties of the @xmath0 topology we need at least three things : spinors , entanglement , and the possibility of interfering a `` rotated '' with",
    "a `` non - rotated '' spinor .",
    "milman and mosseri @xcite considered two sequences of transformations .",
    "both sequences start by being applied to the identity @xmath68 and consist of four rotations , whereby the first two of these rotations act on the first qubit , and the last ones on the second qubit",
    ". however , one sequence belongs to one homotopy class , bringing the point @xmath69 back to itself , whereas the other sequence has @xmath70 as its endpoint and belongs to the other homotopy class .",
    "the idea is to consider sequences of rotations for which the rotation axis is not kept constant , as it was the case in the neutron experiments referred to above . according to milman and mosseri , by keeping the rotation axis constant the @xmath11 phase detected in those experiments is not necessarily related to the `` subtle nature of @xmath0 '' , but to `` a property shared by @xmath0 and its subgroup @xmath71 '' . in order to apply those results which are valid only for a constant rotation axis",
    ", the sequence of rotations considered in @xcite does not entail a continuously varying rotation axis , but it is split into four rotations .",
    "each one of these rotations is performed about a fixed direction , which is changed from one rotation to the next .",
    "et al_. @xcite consider instead a continuously changing rotation axis @xmath72 .",
    "this particular case corresponds to a spin driven by a magnetic field which is precessing around the @xmath73-axis .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation can be solved exactly in this case as well @xcite .",
    "now , for our present purposes , it suffices to note that the evolution of a spinor driven by a general hamiltonian @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 , with @xmath76 .",
    "this holds true for a general @xmath77 , even though an expression for @xmath78 is not easily obtained in closed form but in the two aforementioned cases .",
    "hence , eqs.([3 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) remain valid for a variable @xmath77 , in general .",
    "these equations enable us to calculate - at least formally - the evolved mes as    @xmath79    milman and mosseri point out one aspect of the sequences of rotations they consider .",
    "namely , that for both sequences , irrespective of the homotopy class to which they belong , their dynamical phase vanishes . as for the pancharatnam phase , it also vanishes , except in those cases where the evolved state `` crosses the space orthogonal to the initial state , where it abruptly changes by @xmath11 '' @xcite .",
    "this feature is interpreted as giving further support to the contention that these @xmath11-phases have a purely topological origin .    taking the time derivative of eq.(7 ) it is easy to see that not only for the particular sequences considered by milman and mosseri , or for those proposed by liming _ et .",
    "al_. , but quite generally , the states @xmath80 evolve in time satisfying    @xmath81    which is the condition for parallel transport @xcite .",
    "furthermore ,    @xmath82    hence , recalling the definition of the geometric phase ,    @xmath83    we see that , because the dynamical phase @xmath84 in our case , the geometric phase @xmath85 reduces to the pancharatnam - or total - phase ; i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "whenever @xmath87 , the geometric phase @xmath88 .",
    "so we see that each time the point @xmath89 is brought to the surface of the solid ball of radius @xmath11 that constitutes the parameter space of @xmath0 ( see the appendix ) , it accumulates a @xmath11 phase .",
    "however , we can hardly say that these increments of @xmath11 in @xmath90 should be interpreted as evidencing a _ new _ sort of phase , which would be distinctly related to the topology of @xmath0 .",
    "all these results are indeed known since a couple of years and have been discussed within a more general framework by sjqvist @xcite , who was interested on a variable degree of entanglement . from a physical point of view , it appears to be far more interesting to study the nonclassical dependence of the geometric phase on the degree of entanglement @xcite , than to investigate the topology of @xmath0 by experimental means .",
    "even so , and because questions related to the subtleties of the @xmath0 topology have recently attracted much attention , we find it necessary to analyze in detail what features the newly proposed experiments would have in common with those already performed in the past using neutrons . in the following section we employ the tools of quantum optics to analyze some representative experiments on neutron interferometry .",
    "a @xmath11-phase that arises as a consequence of a @xmath12 rotation applied to spinors is a familiar feature of these eminently quantum - mechanical objects .",
    "the @xmath91 factor that the corresponding wave function acquires as a consequence of such an evolution was first assumed to be unobservable , but experiments performed by werner _",
    "et al_. @xcite and by rauch _",
    "@xcite - prompted by _",
    "experiments discussed by aharonov and susskind @xcite and bernstein @xcite - brought such a factor into evidence .",
    "these experiments used an unpolarized neutron beam , which was coherently split into two other beams at the entrance of an interferometer .",
    "the two beams were reflected by means of crystals , so as to bring them to a point where they recombine and interfere , before being detected . in order to make the @xmath11-phase appear , one of the two beams",
    "was subjected to the action of a tunable magnetic field , before recombining it with the other beam .",
    "et al_. @xcite used two detectors , @xmath5 and @xmath92 , in order to show the sinusoidal variation of the difference in neutron counts , @xmath93 , as a function of the magnetic field ; that is , as a function of @xmath94 , with @xmath95 fixed and variable @xmath96 . the arrangement is essentially a young s type interferometer ( see fig . ( 1 ) ) , in which one of the beams is subjected to a tunable dephasing .    in a conventional young s",
    "interferometer the counting rate is given by an expression of the form @xmath97 , where the constant @xmath98 encapsulates how the interferometer acts on the incoming beam by splitting it into two other beams , and @xmath99 is a phase arising from their path difference .",
    "the essential point that we want to stress here is the following : a full quantum - mechanical treatment of the young s interferometer requires that we invoke a field theoretic description , with the radiation field being given by a density operator @xmath100 , and the electromagnetic field being described in terms of annihilation and creation operators for each possible mode . for single - mode excitation , the young s interference experiment can be described @xcite in terms of the boson operator @xmath101 , where each @xmath102 @xmath103 refers to the respective pinhole of the interferometer depicted in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the photon state out of which the interference fringes arise is therefore given by @xmath104 , with @xmath105 meaning a state with @xmath106 photons in the corresponding mode @xmath102 .",
    "the constant @xmath98 introduced above reads ,  for the present case @xcite , @xmath107 . for modes of equal intensity one has @xmath108 and the counting rate becomes @xmath109 , in accordance with the classical result .",
    "we see that a proper , full quantum - mechanical treatment of young s experiment requires the appearance of the _ entangled _ state @xmath110 .",
    "an analogous treatment can be envisaged for neutron experiments of the sort performed by werner _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "indeed , as silverman @xcite has shown , a mach - zehnder charged - fermion interferometer , in which a confined magnetic field causes an aharonov - bohm phase - shift between the two beams , can be treated field theoretically like young s experiment .",
    "this is also the case for the experimental arrangement of werner _",
    "et al_. , as one can easily show .",
    "the interferometer used by werner _",
    "et al_. ( fig .",
    "2 ) can be described @xcite in terms of fermion annihilation operators @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which correspond to the output states going towards detectors @xmath113  and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "these operators satisfy the usual anticommutation relations and can be written in terms of the input operators @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the usual way @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath117 and @xmath118 refer to the two spatial modes ( i.e. , arms ) of the interferometer and @xmath119 makes explicit the dependence of the operators on the spin variables .",
    "such an interferometer is effectively the same as a mach - zehnder interferometer like the one shown in fig.(3 ) .",
    "we can describe it in terms of the parameters characterizing the beam - splitter and the dephasing elements .",
    "we thus obtain , suppressing explicit reference to @xmath119 , for brevity :     causing spin precession .",
    "the other beam goes through a field - free region .",
    "a @xmath120 precession of the one beam causes a relative @xmath121-shift between the phases of the two beams . ]     of entangled states .",
    "there are two dephasing elements , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "one of them can be used to make a @xmath124 term appear in the coincidence counts of detectors @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the parameters @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 ( reflection and transmission amplitudes ) characterize the four - ports , lossless beam - splitter . ]",
    "@xmath129    where @xmath130 is the phase shift suffered by the beam going along arm @xmath131 .",
    "the parameters @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , refer to the reflection and transmission amplitudes of a four - ports , lossless beam - splitter .",
    "the counting rates in detectors @xmath113 and @xmath114 are given by    @xmath134 so that , writing them in terms of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , we have    @xmath137    here , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , with @xmath140 , whereas the other phases are defined through the following equations : @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .    the density operator @xmath144 that corresponds to the experimental arrangement of werner _",
    "et al_. @xcite is build up as a statistical mixture of pure , antisymmetrized states of the form @xmath145 , with @xmath146 ( spin up and down ) .",
    "it is thus given by @xmath147 .",
    "on one of the two arms of the interferometer there is a magnetic field causing the spin precession that gives rise to @xmath148 . depending on whether @xmath149 or @xmath150 , we have @xmath151 , with @xmath152 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the meaning of the parameters , noting only that @xmath153 is the variable magnetic field and @xmath154 the length over which it acts . with a @xmath144",
    "as given above we obtain    @xmath155    the results of werner _",
    "et al_. can be reproduced by appropriately choosing the beam - splitter parameters , so as to mimic their experimental arrangement .",
    "besides that , we need also to add a residual phase shift @xmath156 that is attributable to various causes , including gravity @xcite . taking @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 , @xmath161 , we have    @xmath162    in accordance with the results given by werner _",
    "et al_. ( see eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we see therefore that the experiments in neutron interferometry , showing the sign reversal of a spinor subjected to a @xmath12 rotation , can be interpreted as arising from entangled states of the form @xmath163 . in",
    "what follows , we write states of this sort as @xmath164 , and @xmath165 , in order to stress the analogy with the ones considered by milman and mosseri : ( @xmath166 ) .",

    "et al_. have been usually interpreted as putting into evidence the transformation properties of spin-@xmath2 particles under rotations .",
    "these rotations are represented by elements of the @xmath3-manifold , the universal covering group of @xmath167 the one - to - one map that can be established is a map between elements of @xmath168 and matrices @xmath50 of the form given by eq.([2 ] ) .",
    "these matrices can be taken as representing a rotation matrix , or else a mes .",

    "our @xmath224 corresponds to the relative phase - shift @xmath179 between the beams in each arm of the interferometer and which is attributable - as already said - to different causes , including gravity , while our @xmath225 corresponds to @xmath226 , the phase introduced by acting on the internal degrees of freedom , i.e. , on the spin , by means of a magnetic field .    at first sight",
    ", the above interpretation of the neutron experiments seems to be rather unrelated to the one given in terms of entangled states . in order to see how these two interpretations relate to one another , we resort to an alternative description @xcite of the output intensity , eq.([mix2 ] ) , given in terms of pure state interference profiles",
    "these profiles arise as follows .",
    "consider the pure input state @xmath189 .",
    "in accordance with eq.([mixdef ] ) , if this state goes along the @xmath172-arm of the interferometer , it suffers the change @xmath228 , whereas if it goes along the @xmath173-arm it suffers the change @xmath229 .",
    "the output intensity associated with the input state @xmath230 is then given by    @xmath231    now , as we have already seen in the case of young s interferometer , the output intensity , as given by @xmath232 , can also be derived within the framework of a full quantum description .",
    "such a description requires , however , that we resort to entangled states .",
    "the same holds true in the case of eq.([mix3 ] ) and with it , also in the case of a weighted mixture of pure states , as given by @xmath233 .",
    "this mixed state @xmath186 gives rise to an output intensity @xmath234 .",
    "it is then easy to see that this output intensity profile is the same as the one given by eq.([mix2 ] ) :    @xmath235    here , @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 $ ] , @xmath239 .",
    "this way we see that the seeked connection between the two interpretations occurs at the pure - state level , where a full quantum mechanical approach requires a treatment in terms of entangled states .",
    "next , let us calculate the number of coincident counts , @xmath240 , for the density matrix given above .",
    "we obtain the following result :    @xmath241 \\right\\ } \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { e^{i\\triangle \\varphi } \\left [ r^{\\ast } t^{\\prime } \\left| t\\right| ^{2}+t^{\\ast } r^{\\prime } \\left| t^{\\prime } \\right| ^{2}% \\right ] + e^{-i\\triangle \\varphi } \\left [ t^{\\prime \\ast } r\\left| r^{\\prime } \\right| ^{2}+tr^{\\prime \\ast } \\left| r\\right| ^{2}\\right ] \\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the parameters of a lossless beam - splitter have to satisfy the equations @xcite @xmath242 , and @xmath243 , from which it follows that @xmath244 and @xmath245 . replacing these values in the above , general expression",
    ", we see that @xmath246 , as it must , because our mixed state @xmath144 has been constructed out of one - particle states .",
    "now , our aim is to compare a coincidence count in a neutron experiment with the one obtained with an arrangement like the one proposed by milman and mosseri .",
    "to this end , let us consider the case of a pure state @xmath247 , with @xmath248 given by a _",
    "two_-fermion , singlet state @xmath249 .",
    "furthermore , let us consider an experimental arrangement like the one shown in fig.(3 ) , i.e. , a mach - zehnder interferometer in which one of the two beam - splitters has been replaced by a source @xmath250 of the aforementioned entangled states @xmath251 .",
    "we obtain in this case ( taking @xmath252 and @xmath253 , i.e. , parameters corresponding to a symmetrical beam - splitter ) :    @xmath254    where @xmath255 , and @xmath256 , so that @xmath257 .",
    "we have assumed that , in general , both dephasings may depend on the spin orientation . if we want to consider a case like the one corresponding to fig.(2 ) it suffices to take the dephasing in arm @xmath118 as being independent on the spin orientation , @xmath258 , whereas @xmath259 . as for the beam - splitter parameters ,",
    "let us take again the values corresponding to the experiments of werner _",
    "et al_. that we chose before : @xmath260 , @xmath158 , and @xmath160 .",
    "we obtain the following expression for the number of coincident counts :    @xmath261    if we instead consider that both dephasings , @xmath262 and @xmath263 , depend on the spin orientation , we can arrange the experiment so that the dephasing in one arm , @xmath117 say , becomes an integer multiple of @xmath264 so as to have @xmath265 .",
    "in such a case we obtain , considering again @xmath266 ,    @xmath267    thus , we see that the coincidence rate will depend on @xmath8 being even or odd , as in the proposal of milman and mosseri",
    ". the present analysis should serve to make clear some points that in the later proposal could have caused some confusion . in the proposal of milman and mosseri there are three dephasing elements ( properly oriented wave plates ) put on three arms ( modes @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath268 ) , respectively .",
    "the rate of coincident counts in modes @xmath117 and @xmath118 is predicted to be given by @xmath269 , where @xmath4 comes from a tunable dephasing element put on one arm , @xmath118 , of a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the term @xmath124 comes from the dephasing introduced in the opposite arm , @xmath268 , of the mach - zehnder interferometer and it should depend on the nature of the trajectory @xcite in @xmath0 .",
    "there is a third dephasing element , put on arm @xmath117 , which lies outside the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "now , it is the relative phase between the two arms of a mach - zehnder interferometer , the one upon which counting rates usually depend .",
    "one could therefore expect that a third arm is needed in order to make an extra term @xmath270 appear .",
    "the arrangement depicted in fig.(3 ) shows that the appearance of such a term depends instead on the possibility to drive two phases independently from one another .",
    "a third mode seems to be unnecessary , even as a reference mode , so that the arrangement shown in fig.(3 ) could be used in the case of experiments with entangled photons , as well .",
    "we have analyzed in detail different interferometric arrangements in terms of entangled states .",
    "in particular , we focussed our attention on the mach - zehnder interferometer as a basic tool , with the help of which some subtleties of the @xmath0 topology can be experimentally displayed .",
    "experiments performed in the past with neutrons are here re - analyzed in terms of entangled states .",
    "we compared our analysis with another one which has been recently put forward , based on the geometric phase for mixed states .",
    "we showed that in both pure and mixed cases a full quantum - mechanical treatment requires the introduction of entangled states .",
    "this is so because the basic physical phenomenon behind an interferometric experiment , which is the interference pattern arising out of two states , does require the introduction of entangled states when field quantization has been invoked .",
    "this remains true for mixed states , because they are build up as a statistically weighted mixture of pure states .",
    "we have also addressed the question as to what new features would come out by performing experiments like those proposed by milman and mosseri or by liming _",
    "et al_. a central point of their proposals is the one - to - one mapping between the elements of the set @xmath20 and the elements of @xmath13 .",
    "this bijection is achieved by the identification @xmath271 used in the definition of the set @xmath20",
    ". however , one thing is to mathematically define such a set and quite another thing is to experimentally implement it . to this end",
    ", one should be able to give a prescription as to how is it possible - at least in principle - to realize the afore said identification in a laboratory . as we stressed it before ,",
    "the identification that is experimentally realized routinely is the one between @xmath25 and the whole ray @xmath272 .",
    "the experiments proposed by milman and mosseri consider subjecting one of the two beams that constitute a mes to a variable dephasing .",
    "the other beam serves as a reference one , with respect to which the phase - shift of the first beam is measured .",
    "this shift may be engineered so as to be dependent on an even or an odd multiple of @xmath11 , by splitting it into two beams with the help of a mach - zehnder interferometer . in",
    "so far , the physics upon which the effect relies is just the same as in a classical neutron experiment : a relative @xmath11-phase difference arising out of a rotated two - level system .",
    "it is immaterial that such a two - level system be realized in practice as a spin-@xmath2 particle ( a neutron ) or as a polarized photon .",
    "entanglement is in both cases behind the observed phenomenon .",
    "we have considered a neutron experiment designed to measure coincidence counts when one introduces independent dephasings in the two arms of a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "these coincidence counts would depend on the @xmath11-phase gained by a spinor under a @xmath12 rotation .",
    "such an experiment would require to feed the mach - zehnder interferometer with a singlet state of two fermions .",
    "to our knowledge , these experiments have not been performed . in the context of the classical neutron experiments , which were designed to reveal the @xmath11-phase , it would have been superfluous to perform such experiments with entangled , two - fermion states .",
    "of course , their realizability with the technology that was available three decades ago is quite another question .",
    "present day technology offers the opportunity to develop experiments that complement those performed in the past with neutrons .",
    "the newly proposed experiments would make use of entangled states of two - level systems - polarized photons - which are not straightforwardly realized with spin-@xmath2 particles , like neutrons or electrons .",
    "arrangements of the sort proposed by milman and mosseri  - or by liming _",
    "et al_. - widen markedly the versatility for realizing different paths along the @xmath3-manifold , when compared with the classical neutron experiments . however , to consider the predicted effects as a manifestation of a _ new _ topological phase seems to be , in our view , unjustified . in any case , the simple arrangement we discussed in the present work , which is illustrated in fig.(3 ) , should serve to make clear which essential features could be brought into evidence by experiments of this sort .",
    "here we remind some known facts @xcite related to topological properties of the groups @xmath0 and @xmath3 . whereas these properties are well known , in the view of some authors @xcite they could lead to misinterpretations that can be found even in textbooks .",
    "it seems thus justified to include here a very short review of some results concerning lie groups , in order to make sure that our statements be unambiguous .",
    "let us first discuss in some detail the double connectedness of @xmath0 .",
    "the lie groups @xmath3 and @xmath0 are locally isomorphic , although globally they differ from each other . whereas @xmath3 is simply connected , @xmath0 is not .",
    "both groups share one and the same algebra . among the groups sharing a given algebra ,",
    "only one is simply connected .",
    "this group is called the _ universal covering group_. all groups sharing a lie algebra can be obtained from their universal covering group . to this end",
    ", one needs to determine the discrete invariant subgroups @xmath273 of the simply connected group @xmath274 .",
    "the elements @xmath275 satisfy @xmath276 for all @xmath277 in @xmath278 . after having determined @xmath273",
    ", one can construct the factor group @xmath279 .",
    "the factor group has the same lie algebra as @xmath274 . when @xmath273 has more than one element , @xmath279 is multiply connected . in our case",
    "@xmath274 is @xmath3 , and its discrete invariant subgroup @xmath273 is @xmath280 , where @xmath180 represents the identity .",
    "hence , @xmath0 is obtained from @xmath3 as the factor group @xmath281 .",
    "it is well known that the elements of a lie group can be obtained from the elements of its algebra by exponentiation . to any curve in the parameter space of the algebra it corresponds a curve in the parameter space of the group .",
    "conventionally , one takes the origin of the parameter space of the group as representing the identity element .",
    "the group @xmath0 is a three - parameter group .",
    "it can be visualized by picturing its elements as points of a solid ball of radius @xmath11 .",
    "each point @xmath282 of this ball at a distance @xmath283 from the origin represents a _ counterclockwise _ rotation about the axis @xmath284 by an angle @xmath283 .",
    "hence , antipodal points on the surface of the ball represent the same rotation .",
    "for example , in fig.([f1a ] ) points @xmath285 and @xmath286 represent the same rotation .",
    "the path shown in fig.([f1a ] ) corresponds to the application of successive rotations .",
    "it starts with the identity transformation @xmath287 until it reaches the rotation represented by @xmath288 , from where it goes back to @xmath287 .",
    "although @xmath285 and @xmath286 represent the same rotation , we should stress that to the jump from @xmath285 to @xmath286 it corresponds a change in the rotation axis .",
    "the path shown in fig.([f1b ] ) is homotopically the same as the one shown in fig.([f1a ] ) ; i.e. , one of these paths can be continuously deformed into the other .",
    "the path shown in fig.([f1b ] ) corresponds to a series of rotations sharing the common axis @xmath289 .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 is doubly connected can be evidenced by considering a path like the one shown in fig.([f2a ] ) .",
    "it represents a series of rotations going from @xmath287 to @xmath288 , from there to @xmath290 , from where one goes back to @xmath287 .",
    "such a path is homotopically the same as the paths shown in figs.([f1a ] ) and ( [ f1b ] ) , when these paths have been traversed _ twice_. in other words , the path shown in fig.([f1b ] ) traversed twice can be continuously deformed to the path shown in fig.([f2a ] ) .",
    "this last path , in turn , can be continuously deformed to the identity .",
    "fig.([f2b ] ) shows an intermediate step of such a transformation .",
    "any curve like @xmath291 is homotopically equivalent to the identity . on the contrary ,",
    "a curve like the one shown in fig.([f1a ] ) is not .",
    "the double connectedness of @xmath0 is related to the fact that there exist paths like this last one , which can not be deformed into a single point at @xmath287 . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameter space of @xmath3 consists of a solid ball of radius @xmath12 , for which all points on the surface represent the same transformation : @xmath292 .",
    "any closed path starting and ending at @xmath287 can be continuously deformed to a single point at the origin .",
    "@xmath3 is thus simply connected .",
    "the double connectedness of @xmath0 comes about in situations like the one illustrated in fig.([f3a ] ) .",
    "it represents a series of transformations that start and end at the identity : @xmath293 . for clarity",
    ", we have displaced one curve from the other , although what is meant is a series of rotations about the same axis @xmath294 by the same angle @xmath11 .",
    "the total angle covered along this path is therefore @xmath222 and , as we have seen before , such a path is homotopically identical to the identity .",
    "the path shown in fig.([f3b ] ) : @xmath295 is homotopically identical to the identity , as well .",
    "however , in this case the first half of the path corresponds to a @xmath11-rotation about @xmath296 and the second one to a @xmath11-rotation about @xmath297 .",
    "the two paths of figs.([f3a ] ) and ( [ f3b ] ) pertain to the same homotopy class . on the contrary ,",
    "paths like the ones shown in figs.([f1a ] ) and ( [ f1b ] ) correspond to the second homotopy class .",
    "they can not be deformed to the identity @xmath180 , but are associated with the other element of @xmath298 , which is @xmath292 .",
    "we are now ready to address the question as to how could we design an experiment that brings into evidence the double connectedness of @xmath0 .",
    "according to what we saw , the answer reads as follows : if we want to disclose the subtleties of @xmath0 which are related to its double connectedness , what we need is a physical effect that clearly distinguishes the transformations @xmath180 and @xmath292 from one another .",
    "we need an object for which a @xmath12 rotation would bring about a minus sign .",
    "such an object is , of course , a spin-@xmath2 particle .",
    "hence , it is precisely in order to disclose the subtleties of @xmath0 that we need to work with its universal covering group , which is @xmath3 .",
    "this was the goal of the neutron experiments @xcite performed three decades ago .",
    "an experiment designed to disclose the subtleties of @xmath0 should preferably map elements of @xmath3 into physical operations , not into states . in our case",
    ", the operation corresponds to an element of @xmath3 and it is applied to a spinor .",
    "it is essential that this spinor be part of an entangled state , in order to obtain an interference pattern from which a relative phase may be read off .",
