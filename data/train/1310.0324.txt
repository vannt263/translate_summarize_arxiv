    "in this paper it will be shown how the generalisation of symmetry properties of perfect solid crystals to crystals with certain uniform distributions of defects leads to a classification of the symmetries of discrete defective crystals as elastic or inelastic .",
    "we show that , in contrast with the perfect crystal case , some of the symmetries of a discrete defective crystal do not extend uniquely to a symmetry of the continuum model of the defective crystal .",
    "this allows us to classify the symmetries which do nt extend as inelastic symmetries of the discrete defective crystal , while those which do extend uniquely are restrictions of elastic deformations of the continuous crystal and we call these symmetries elastic symmetries of the discrete crystal .    a starting point for the study of the mechanics of perfect solid crystals is to consider the geometrical symmetries of perfect lattices in @xmath0 : @xmath1 where @xmath2 are defining basis vectors and the summation convention operates on repeated indices .",
    "the perfect lattice @xmath3 defines a discrete set of points in @xmath0 and can also be thought of as a discrete subgroup of the continuous lie group @xmath0 with addition as group composition .",
    "the discrete structures @xmath3 in @xmath0 have geometrical symmetries @xmath4 given by @xmath5 the symmetries of @xmath3 are bijective and preserve addition as well as the set of points in @xmath0 defined by @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , every symmetry @xmath6 of a perfect lattice @xmath3 extends uniquely to a bijection of @xmath0 .",
    "here we extend and generalise these properties of the symmetries of perfect crystals to a certain class of defective crystal where the distribution of defects is uniform .",
    "we use davini s continuum model of defective crystals @xcite , in which the dislocation density tensor @xmath7 , @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 where the fields @xmath10 are dual to the smooth _ lattice vector fields _ @xmath11 , which represent the crystal geometry in a region @xmath12 .",
    "a crystal with a uniform distribution of defects has dislocation density tensor which is constant in space .",
    "( note that for perfect crystals @xmath13 . )",
    "suppose that @xmath14 is a set of lattice vector fields which are elastically related to @xmath15 in the sense that there exists a smooth invertible mapping @xmath16 such that @xmath17 we say that @xmath18 is an elastic deformation .",
    "if @xmath19 is calculated via the analogue of , using fields dual to @xmath20 , then @xmath21 therefore , each component @xmath22 of the dislocation density tensor is an ` elastic ' scalar invariant so that the value of the dislocation density is unchanged by elastic deformations of the crystal . due to this elastic invariance ,",
    "for a given dislocation density tensor @xmath23 there are infinitely many choices of ( elastically related ) sets of corresponding lattice vector fields .",
    "it is a commonly held idea in the elasticity theory of perfect crystals that there is a continuum energy density @xmath24 which depends on the underlying perfect lattice @xmath3 ; that is @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the set of vectors @xmath27 . if the basis vectors @xmath28 generate the same lattice @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath29 in ) then @xmath30 in other words the geometrical symmetries of @xmath3 correspond to the material symmetries of the energy density function @xmath24 .",
    "here we use a generalisation of this theory which accounts for the presence of a continuous distribution of defects in the crystal .",
    "it is assumed that the strain energy density per unit volume in such a crystal depends on the values of the lattice vector fields @xmath31 , @xmath32",
    ", @xmath33 and dislocation density tensor @xmath34 at some point in @xmath12 . thus @xmath35 where @xmath26 denotes the set of vectors @xmath27 which are the values of the lattice vector fields at some point in @xmath12 , and @xmath23 denotes the dislocation density tensor evaluated at the same point . as we shall see in section [ sec : structure ] , the arguments of the energy density function determine a structure @xmath36 which under certain conditions will be a discrete set of points .",
    "if another set of arguments , say @xmath37 , determine the same discrete structure then it is assumed that @xmath38 hence for crystals with defects we are associating that the symmetries of the energy density function with the geometrical symmetries of the structure @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the structure @xmath36 is taken to be the defective crystal analogue of the perfect lattice @xmath3 underlying perfect crystals , and it is a central task to determine the geometrical symmetries of @xmath36 .    notice that the arguments @xmath39 of @xmath24 give no information regarding gradients of @xmath23 , and we shall assume that they are zero .",
    "therefore the dislocation density tensor @xmath23 is constant in space and the crystal has a uniform distribution of defects .",
    "it is this assumption that endows the crystal with a lie group structure .",
    "suppose that the vector fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , defined here and henceforth on @xmath40 , give constant @xmath23 . then according to pontryagin @xcite , the system of partial differential equations @xmath41 has a solution for the function @xmath42 , where @xmath43 denotes the gradient of @xmath42 with respect to its first argument . moreover , the function @xmath44 can be taken to satisfy the properties required for it to be a lie group composition function on @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the group identity element and @xmath47 is the unique inverse of the element @xmath48 @xcite . here , the lie group @xmath49 has underlying manifold @xmath0 so that an element @xmath50 can be uniquely specified by @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a basis of @xmath0 .",
    "we will often use the alternative notation @xmath54 .",
    "( note that in the perfect crystal case where @xmath55 , we can take @xmath42 to be addition so that @xmath56 . )",
    "relation expresses the _ right invariance _ of the fields @xmath57 with respect to the lie group @xmath58 .",
    "suppose that the fields @xmath59 are elastically related to @xmath57 via @xmath18 as in . then if @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61 then @xmath62 hence the fields @xmath59 are right invariant with respect to the lie group @xmath63 and since @xmath64 is invertible , the groups @xmath65 and @xmath66 are isomorphic .",
    "thus , elastically related crystal states have isomorphic corresponding lie groups .",
    "recall that the dislocation density tensor @xmath23 is an elastic invariant so there is an infinite choice of elastically related lattice vector fields which have duals which satisfy for a given constant dislocation density .",
    "therefore , there is also an infinite number of choices of isomorphic lie groups @xmath49 corresponding to @xmath23 .",
    "hence a given constant @xmath23 determines up to lie group isomorphism a lie group @xmath65 . in this paper",
    "we make a ` canonical ' choice of the lie group @xmath65 to simplify the computations .",
    "we identify material points of the crystal with elements of the lie group .",
    "when @xmath65 has a uniform discrete subgroup @xmath36 ( where @xmath67 is uniform if the left coset space @xmath68 is compact ) the material points corresponding to the elements in @xmath36 have a minimum separation distance and form discrete geometrical structures which we take to the defective crystal analogue of the perfect lattice @xmath3 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath68 be compact is a generalisation of the fact that in the perfect crystal case that @xmath69 ( the unit cell of the lattice @xmath3 with appropriate identification of boundary points ) is compact .",
    "according to auslander , green and hahn @xcite there are precisely three classes of non - abelian , three dimensional lie groups @xmath65 with uniform discrete subgroups .",
    "these are a certain class of nilpotent lie groups and two non - isomorphic classes of solvable lie groups . for each of these cases we are interested in the form of the geometrical structures corresponding to the discrete subgroups @xmath36 and the geometrical symmetries of these structures ( i.e. the changes of generators of @xmath36 which preserve the points in the geometrical structure ) .",
    "these have already been determined in all three cases :    * when the lie group @xmath65 is nilpotent ( with corresponding lie algebra with rational structure constants ) , cermelli and parry @xcite have shown that the corresponding discrete subgroups give either a simple lattice or a 4-lattice ( in pitteri and zanzotto s terminology @xcite ) even though the composition function in @xmath65 is not additive .",
    "for such groups , parry and sigrist @xcite construct explicitly all sets of generators of a given discrete subgroup .",
    "the formulae that connect different sets of generators generalise the perfect crystal case given by . *",
    "auslander et al .",
    "@xcite call the two classes of solvable groups @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "it has been shown by parry and nicks that in both cases the geometrical structures corresponding to the discrete subgroups of these solvable groups are simple lattices .",
    "the changes of generators preserving these structures were also determined ( see @xcite for the @xmath70 case and @xcite for the @xmath71 case ) .",
    "in this paper we focus on a property of the symmetries of perfect lattices which does not hold in the generalisation to the symmetries of discrete structures underlying crystals with uniform distributions of defects .",
    "recall that the geometrical symmetries of a perfect lattice @xmath3 are bijections @xmath4 as in which preserve addition .",
    "each of these symmetries extends uniquely to a bijection @xmath72 defined by @xmath73 thus every symmetry of @xmath3 represents a ( restriction of an ) elastic deformation of the continuum perfect crystal .",
    "this is not the case for crystals with constant @xmath74 where the underlying lie group , @xmath58 , is solvable or nilpotent . in these cases",
    "there is a difference between the set of all geometrical symmetries of a discrete structure @xmath75 and the subset of these symmetries which preserve the group structure of @xmath36 and extend uniquely to elastic deformations of @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to classify the symmetries of the discrete structures @xmath36 which preserve the group structure as elastic or inelastic depending on whether or not they are restrictions of elastic deformations of the continuum defective crystal .",
    "the observation that such a classification can be made is interesting because it indicates a possible link between the inelastic symmetries of the discrete crystal @xmath36 ( which preserve the elastic invariant @xmath23 and the discrete structure ) and observed inelastic processes in crystal behaviour such as slip in particular planes and directions determined by geometry .",
    "notice that we consider here only symmetries of discrete structures @xmath36 which additionally preserve the group structure .",
    "we do not discuss here symmetries where the discrete structure represents discrete subgroups of different lie groups , isomorphic or not .",
    "our simplified task then is to identify which of the geometrical symmetries of discrete subgroups @xmath75 extend uniquely to elastic deformations of @xmath0 . this task breaks down into two stages .",
    "first we must determine which of the geometrical symmetries of @xmath36 preserve the group structure of @xmath36 ; that is which of the symmetries will extend to _ automorphisms _ of @xmath36 .",
    "secondly we need to determine if these automorphisms of @xmath36 extend uniquely to automorphisms of the ambient lie group @xmath65 . for a geometrical symmetry of @xmath36",
    "to be classified as an elastic symmetry it must extend to an automorphism of @xmath36 and that automorphism must extend uniquely to an automorphism of @xmath65 , since these are requirements that must be satisfied in order that the geometrical symmetry is a restriction of an elastic deformation of the defective crystal .    in the cases where the structure @xmath36 is a discrete subgroup of a nilpotent lie group or a solvable lie group in the class @xmath70 such a classification of the geometrical symmetries of @xmath36 has been carried out .",
    "the automorphisms of the discrete subgroups @xmath36 have been computed ( see @xcite for the nilpotent case and @xcite for the @xmath70 case ) and it has been observed that theorems of malcev @xcite and gorbatsevich @xcite guarantee that every automorphism of @xmath36 extends uniquely to an automorphism of the ambient lie group @xmath65 . in this paper",
    "we will complete the analysis by classifying the geometrical symmetries of discrete subgroups @xmath36 of solvable groups in the class @xmath71 . in this case",
    "we must work a little harder since although it remains relatively straightforward to compute which of the geometrical symmetries of @xmath36 correspond to automorphisms of @xmath36 , there is no analogue of the theorems of malcev and gorbatsevich for solvable groups of this class .",
    "therefore we must determine directly whether or not automorphisms of @xmath36 extend uniquely to automorphisms of @xmath71 .",
    "the difficulties arise for the @xmath71 class due to the fact that the exponential mapping from the corresponding lie algebra @xmath76 to @xmath71 is not one - to - one .",
    "we begin by recalling how to construct discrete structures @xmath36 corresponding to a particular set of arguments @xmath39 of the energy density function @xmath24 .",
    "these are discrete subgroups of lie groups @xmath65 and we will also recall elements of lie group theory that will be required in this paper , including facts about lie group isomorphisms . in section [ sec :",
    "solvable ] , following auslander et al .",
    "@xcite and nicks and parry @xcite we introduce the group @xmath71 and the canonical group in the isomorphism class which we will work with .",
    "we also introduce the lie algebra @xmath76 of the lie group @xmath71 and calculate the automorphisms of @xmath71 . in section",
    "[ sec : discrete ] we discuss the discrete subgroups @xmath36 of @xmath71 , recalling results from nicks and parry @xcite concerning their geometrical symmetries .",
    "we next compute the automorphisms of these discrete subgroups @xmath36 which amounts to determining the matrices @xmath77 which commute with a given matrix @xmath78 which is related to the dislocation density .",
    "this is a number theoretic problem studied by baake and roberts @xcite and here we summarize their results which are relevant to this work .",
    "finally in section [ sec : extensions ] we demonstrate explicitly that each of these automorphisms of @xmath36 extends uniquely to an automorphism of @xmath71 .",
    "suppose that we are given a set of arguments of an energy density function for a crystal with a uniform distribution of defects .",
    "that is , we are given @xmath39 where @xmath23 is some value of the dislocation density tensor and the ( linearly independent ) vectors @xmath79 , @xmath80 are values of some lattice vector fields @xmath81 evaluated at some point , say @xmath46 , in @xmath0 such that their duals satisfy .",
    "furthermore ( since we assume the crystal is uniform ) the fields @xmath81 also satisfy for some group composition function @xmath42 on @xmath0 .",
    "the following survey of facts about the lie group @xmath49 follows that given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and is given here for completeness .",

    "thus @xmath478 if @xmath479 extends to @xmath480 then @xmath481 for all @xmath482 . in section [ sec : automorphisms ] we computed all automorphisms @xmath483 of @xmath313 and these automorphisms are in one to one correspondence with the automorphisms of @xmath36 since they satisfy @xmath484 therefore @xmath485 \\\\ q\\zeta\\end{array}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with respect to the basis @xmath233 , recalling the definition of the matrix of exponents @xmath398 from and where @xmath486    from the automorphism @xmath480 is uniquely determined by the values of @xmath248 and @xmath150 and satisfies @xmath487 where @xmath488 ( the top left @xmath164 matrix contained in @xmath242 ) and the quantities @xmath489 and @xmath490 are as defined in section [ sec : s2auto ] . here",
    "the components are again given with respect to the basis @xmath233 .",
    "comparing and we see that if @xmath479 is to extend to @xmath480 , it must be the case that @xmath491 and furthermore , for all @xmath477 @xmath492= \\\\ & & \\qquad \\qquad    w(\\epsilon ) \\left(\\begin{array}{cc } \\alpha & \\beta \\\\ -\\beta & \\alpha\\end{array } \\right ) \\overline{m}^{-t } \\theta^q \\left(\\begin{array}{c } m \\\\",

    "\\label{eq : extcond } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus we must have @xmath493 where @xmath494 in .    using the fact that @xmath495 since @xmath479 is an automorphism , from we find @xmath496 and hence the real numbers @xmath497 and @xmath498 are uniquely determined by the values of @xmath499 and @xmath398 .",
    "furthermore , let us define @xmath500 then we can note from that if @xmath501 , the matrix @xmath490 has a well defined inverse and we can write @xmath502 ( if @xmath503 then both sides of are zero and we gain no information about @xmath504 and @xmath505 for given values of @xmath456 and @xmath506 . ) it can be observed that the value of the matrix @xmath507 is independent of @xmath501 and is given by @xmath508 since this matrix is nonsingular , the values of @xmath504 and @xmath505 are determined uniquely by the values of the exponents @xmath456 and @xmath506 for a given automorphism of @xmath36 .",

    "the technical calculations given in this paper have allowed us to complete the classification of symmetries of crystals with uniform distributions of defects , which preserve the lie group structure .",
    "let us now briefly summarize the results .",
    "the energy density @xmath24 of a crystal with a uniform distribution of defects depends on arguments @xmath512 and @xmath23 , where the vectors @xmath26 specify a set of generators of a discrete subgroup @xmath36 of the lie group associated with the given constant value of the dislocation density tensor @xmath23 .",
    "the underlying lie group must be in one of three classes : it is either nilpotent or isomorphic to one of two classes of solvable lie groups denoted @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in this paper",
    "we have focused on the case where the lie group is a solvable group in the class @xmath71 .",
    "a symmetry of the energy density function is a change of generators of @xmath36 which preserves the set of points in @xmath0 associated with the elements of @xmath36 .",
    "these symmetries have been shown to satisfy conditions  for subgroups @xmath311 .",
    "of these changes of generators , only those which extend to automorphisms @xmath479 of @xmath36 also preserve the group structure .",
    "these are the changes of generators which satisfy condition .",
    "these symmetries also have been shown in this paper to extend uniquely to automorphisms of the underlying continuous lie group @xmath71 and hence they are ( restrictions of ) elastic deformations of the continuum defective crystal .",
    "we call such symmetries of @xmath36 ` elastic ' .",
    "the remaining symmetries of @xmath36 which do not extend to automorphisms of @xmath36 ( or @xmath71 ) are classified as inelastic .    together with work presented in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", this completes the classification of all group preserving symmetries of uniform discrete defective crystals as either elastic or inelastic .",
    "a future task will be to understand the properties of the inelastic symmetries with reference to corresponding mechanical problems including exploring any possible correlations between these symmetries and the presence of slip planes in crystalline materials .",
