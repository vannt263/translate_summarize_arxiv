    "`` water fountain '' ( wf ) stars are low- to intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath3 m@xmath4 ) evolved objects that show collimated jets traced by high - velocity water masers at 22 ghz ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* for reviews ) . the velocity spread in their water maser spectra is typically @xmath5 km s@xmath2 , and can be as large as @xmath6 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these velocities indicate the presence of motions faster than the typical expansion velocities in spherical agb envelopes , of @xmath7 km s@xmath2 , as traced by double - peaked oh maser spectra ( with velocity separations between both components of @xmath8 km s@xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "most wfs are in the short transition phase between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and the planetary nebula ( pn ) stage .",
    "their being in this particular evolutionary stage , together with the short dynamical ages of the maser outflows ( 5 - 100 yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their relatively strong optical obscuration @xcite indicate that wfs may represent one of the first manifestations of collimated mass - loss in evolved stars of low and intermediate mass .",
    "there is growing consensus that the action of collimated jets on the circumstellar envelope during the post - agb phase will determine the shape of pne once photoionization starts @xcite .",
    "therefore , wfs are key objects to understand when and how the spherical symmetry seen in agb stars and earlier stages is broken to give rise to the spectacular variety of morphologies displayed in the pn phase .",
    "only 16 sources have been identified so far as possible wfs @xcite .",
    "fourteen of them seem to be in the post - agb phase . of the remaining two candidates ,",
    "the source w43a may be at the late agb stage @xcite . at the other end of the age spectrum , @xcite detected a wf candidate toward the source iras 15103@xmath05754 ( hereafter i15103 ) , which had been classified as a possible pn @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , this would be the first known pn with wf characteristics .",
    "this confirmation is important , since it would prove that collimated jets with enough energy to pump maser emission can persist after the star enters the pn phase .",
    "such a jet could contribute to the shaping of the nebula while photoionization already proceeds .",
    "i15103 is an optically obscured object @xcite that shows a bipolar morphology in near and mid - infrared images @xcite .",
    "its classification as a pn was based on the presence of radio continuum emission @xcite , which is typically seen in the photoionized regions of these objects .",
    "however , the radio continuum flux density decreases at higher frequencies @xcite , which is indicative of non - thermal emission and can not be attributed to free - free processes in a photoionized region .",
    "the time - evolution of its non - thermal emission has been attributed to the onset of photoionization @xcite . however , to date there is no conclusive evidence that i15103 has already entered the pn phase or even that it is an evolved object . in this paper , we provide solid evidence that i15103 is a bona fide wf , and that it is also pn .",

    "we used the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ) , which provides two independent bands of 2 ghz each , in dual linear polarization .",

    "for the latter epoch of observations , spectral line data presented in this paper were smoothed up to a velocity resolution of @xmath15 km s@xmath2 in our data reduction .",

    "under these conditions , the 1-sigma positional accuracy between the continuum and the maser components ( and among the different maser components ) can be quantified as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the source size in the image ( i.e. , the synthesized beam in the case of point sources ) , and snr is the signal - to - noise ratio . considering maser components @xmath19 jy , these accuracies were typically better than @xmath20 and 25 milliarcsec between maser and continuum for our data on 2011 and 2012 , respectively , and @xmath21 and 20 milliarcsec among maser components , for 2011 and 2012 data , respectively .",

    "the observing mode was dual beam switching , with the emission - free position @xmath30 away from the source position .",
    "we used the hifi wide - band spectrometer ( wbs ) , which provides four adjacent bands per polarization with an instantaneous width of 1  ghz each .",
    "the spectra were initially processed using hipe ( _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ) , version 11.0.1 , and exported to class using the hiclass tool within hipe .",

    "four maser components depart from these main `` strings '' , and they could be part of a different structure ( like an equatorial torus ) , but they are the weakest ones and , hence , their positional accuracy is lower . therefore , a significant fraction of the water maser emission seems to trace a high - velocity , collimated ejection , which confirms its nature as a water fountain .",

    "[ fig_image ] we can see that the maser emission shows a hubble - flow pattern , i.e. , a linear dependence of velocity on distance from the radio continuum position , with increasing relative velocities at larger distances .",
    "this linear trend gives us an estimate of @xmath127 km s@xmath2 for the ( lsr ) radial velocity of the central star ( the intersect velocity of the linear fit at spatial offset = 0 ) , and indicates that most components are blueshifted with respect to it .",

    "a blueshifted bias is also seen in oh maser emission from pne @xcite and high - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) @xcite , and it may have the same physical origin .    the observed kinematical pattern ( the hubble - like flow ) is common in spectroscopic data at optical / infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and co molecular lines @xcite of bipolar pne and post - agb stars . however , it is not clearly present in water maser jets of post - agb wfs @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain these linear velocity gradients in pne and post - agb stars @xcite but all point to short - lived , explosive / ballistic mass - loss events rather than to the presence of steady jets .",
    "on the other hand , the large velocity gradients of an explosive event could in principle make the presence of maser emission difficult , as this emission requires a significant amplification path with coherent velocities along the line of sight .",
    "a possibility for its detection in i15103 is that the mass loss traced by the maser emission consists of discrete parcels of gas ( i.e. , bullets ) ejected in an explosive event .",
    "the gas of each parcel would have the required velocity coherence to produce maser emission .",
    "it is often difficult to ascertain whether an object is a pn .",
    "such a classification requires different observations to discard that it could be a yso or an evolved star in a phase previous to photoionization ( agb or post - agb ) , since all these types of objects share many observational characteristics .",

    "the position of i15103 in the iras and msx two color diagrams is not consistent with that of an hii region @xcite .",
    "moreover , considering its strong obscuration at optical wavelengths , if it was a yso embedded on the parental cloud it should show significant molecular line emission associated with the cloud . in practice",
    ", we should detect interstellar molecular line emission with an lsr velocity close to that of i15103 , but this is not the case . the red msx survey ( rms )",
    "archive @xcite shows several interstellar components of @xmath129co(j=@xmath130 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig_co ] ) .",
    "none of these components is close to that of the star of @xmath127 km s@xmath2 , estimated from the maser position - velocity distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig_image ] and section [ sec_maser ] ) , which indicates that the object is not a ysos .",
    "however , the velocity estimate from the maser distribution is indirect and somewhat uncertain .",
    "a more direct estimate of the stellar velocity can be obtained from our herschel data ( fig .",
    "[ fig_co ] ) .",
    "the co(j=@xmath131 ) spectrum shows some narrow emission and absorption features of interstellar origin , whose velocities coincide with those in the @xmath129co(j=@xmath130 ) spectrum .",
    "however , there is an additional broader , weak component between @xmath132 and @xmath133 km s@xmath2 , close to the central velocity estimated from the maser distribution .",
    "this broad component clearly dominates the co(j=@xmath35 ) emission , which traces hotter gas than the co(j=@xmath131 ) line ( i.e. , presumably closer to the central star ) .",
    "there could still be some interstellar contamination in the co(j=@xmath35 ) spectrum at @xmath134 km s@xmath2 , but there is obvious emission around @xmath135 km s@xmath2 which has no interstellar counterpart in the @xmath129co(j=@xmath130 ) line .",
    "assuming that the emission around 0 km s@xmath2 is interstellar , the broad component would have a half - power width @xmath136 km s@xmath2 ( centered at @xmath137 km s@xmath2 ) , which is significantly broader than the interstellar co(j=@xmath131 ) and @xmath129co(j=@xmath130 ) components , and is similar to the line widths observed in co spectra of other water fountains @xcite , tracing the expansion of the circumstellar structure .",
    "we can conclude that this co(j=@xmath35 ) emission is of circumstellar origin .",
    "the absence of significant interstellar @xmath129co(j=@xmath130 ) molecular line emission associated with the source rules out its nature as a yso .",
    "having established its evolved nature , its classification as a pn relies on the presence of ionized gas .",
    "this is indeed the case , since its ir spectrum shows a clear emission line of [ neii ] at 12.8@xmath36 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig_neii ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the presence of [ neii ] was also hinted at the mid - ir images presented in fig b7 of @xcite .",
    "the filter containing the [ neii ] line is centered at 12.81 @xmath36 m and has a width of 0.42 @xmath36 m , whereas the sic filter is at a nearby wavelength ( 11.85 @xmath36 m ) , but it is ten times wider ( 2.24 @xmath36 m ) and therefore , significantly more sensitive for similar exposure times .",
    "however , note that the image in the narrower [ neii ] filter seems more extended than that in the sic one .",
    "after rescaling both images to get the same peak brightness , we confirmed that this extended emission in brighter in the [ neii ] image .",
    "this is not expected if the emission in those filters is due to continuum alone , so the excess must be attributed to the [ neii ] line emission .",
    "those images suggest that [ neii ] emission is diffuse and extended , as expected in a photoionized region .",
    "there is not a well - established definition of what a wf is .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , other objects with lower velocity spreads ( e.g. , @xmath139 km s@xmath2 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were later included in the wf category given their similarities with higher - velocity objects . despite the lack of a clear - cut definition ,",
    "the general trend is to consider a source as a wfs when its water maser emission traces collimated mass loss with velocities larger than that of the expansion velocities of the circumstellar envelopes in these objects ( 10 - 20 km s@xmath2 , as traced by double - peaked oh spectra with separations of 20 - 40 km s@xmath2 between the components , * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that in agb stars , the velocities of the h@xmath10o maser components is always contained within the velocity range of oh maser emission .",
    "wfs show the opposite behavior , with some h@xmath10o maser emission outside the velocity range of oh @xcite .",
    "however , while this is a useful observational criterion to identify new wf candidates , it does not constitute a definition of wf itself . in the case of i15103 ,",
    "the only published oh spectrum is that obtained with the parkes radio telescope by @xcite , which shows a single component at @xmath140 km s@xmath2 . therefore , it is not possible to obtain an oh velocity range .",
    "moreover , given the large beam of the parkes antenna at 18 cm ( half power beam width @xmath141 ) , there is no guarantee that the oh emission actually arises from i15103 .",
    "therefore , if we define a wf as an object whose water maser emission has a velocity spread larger than that of the typical agb envelopes , and with this emission tracing collimated mass - loss , then i15103 is a wf as far as the definition goes .",
    "however , this source shows some differential characteristics with other wfs that are worth considering :    1 .",
    "the water maser components in i15130 are present over the whole velocity range , without no clear clustering .",
    "the wfs iras 18296@xmath00958 @xcite and oh 009.1 - 0.4 @xcite also show a similar pattern in their spectra .",
    "however , most wfs show two groups of water maser components , clearly separated in velocity ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a third central group at intermediate velocities in some objects @xcite . in the cases with clearly separated groups , the clusters at extreme velocities seem to trace the tips of a bipolar jet , and",
    "the central group could be an equatorial flow .",
    "however , in i15103 and the wfs with no clustering , the maser emission traces the mass loss along the whole body of the jet , not just the tips .",
    "2 .   the `` hubble - flow '' pattern in the position - velocity distribution of masers in i15130 ( fig . [ fig_image ] )",
    "is not clearly seen in any other wf , which suggest that the mass - loss process in this object may be of a different nature .",
    "3 .   there is a clear bias in velocity , with most maser components being blueshifted with respect to the velocity of the central star .",
    "the result is that only the blueshifted side of the jet is clearly collimated .",
    "there are other wfs whose maser jet and/or the spectrum is also one - sided or strongly asymmetrical , such as iras 18460@xmath00151 @xcite or iras 15445@xmath05449 @xcite , but most wfs are clearly bipolar . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec_maser ] , a possible explanation for this bias is the presence of the radio continuum emission , which is amplified by the foreground ( blueshifted ) side of the jet by the maser mechanism .",
    "all these differences with the properties of typical wfs suggest that while i15103 formally fulfil the criteria to be considered a wf , it has some unusual characteristics ( although none of them are unique among wfs ) . moreover , and what is probably more important , the discussion above also indicates that wfs show characteristics that are very different from one another , and that they do not constitute an homogeneous group . we may have to consider revising the definition of what a wf is or , alternatively , to further subdivide this class into several subcategories according to their physical characteristics .",
    "the present category of wfs may in fact include several different types of objects that only share a common characteristic ( the presence of collimated , high - velocity jets traced by water masers ) , but that might be fundamentally different otherwise .    i15103 is also one of the few pne showing water maser emission ( hereafter h@xmath10o - pne ) .",
    "this category of sources comprises a total of 5 confirmed members @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the characteristics of the maser emission in i15103 is also significantly different from the other 4 h@xmath10o - pne .",
    "the velocity spread in the water maser emission in other h@xmath10o - pne is small ( @xmath142 km s@xmath2 ) , and most of the maser emission seem to trace equatorial tori around the central star . only in the case of k3 - 35 @xcite some maser components may be related with a jet , but with a much lower velocity than in the case of wfs .",
    "moreover , these components were transient and have not been observed thereafter @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "although i15103 is formally both a wf and a h@xmath10o - pn , there are significant differences with other members of these classes , and its mere inclusion in these categories should be taken with care .",
    "i15103 might be the first object of a completely different class of evolved object , whose physical characteristics might not be comparable with the rest wfs and h@xmath10o - pne .      even though water maser emission is present in several pne @xcite ,",
    "the collimated high - velocity water maser emission that characterizes wfs have only been observed so far in late agb and post - agb stars .",
    "the presence of a collimated water maser outflow in this source suggests that i15103 is an extremely young pn , which is consistent with the results in @xcite , who suggested that newly started photoionization is changing the spectral index of its radio continuum emission . as mentioned above",
    ", this source is also unique among wfs in the sense that its water maser emission shows a linear increase of velocity with distance from the central star ( a so called hubble flow ) .",
    "this kinematical pattern is expected in explosive or ballistic mass - loss events . in principle",
    ", one could speculate whether maser emission in all wfs have an explosive origin , but the hubble flow would not be evident shortly after the mass - loss event . only as the ejected material moves away from the star , the faster gas would move farther away , and a hubble flow would become evident . the fact that i15103 is a pn , i.e. , in a later evolutionary stage than all the other known wfs , would be consistent with this time evolution of the kinematical pattern .    however , we note that the main structure of water maser emission in i15103 follows a linear distribution , with no clear gap between the maser components and the central star , whereas most wfs show their maser emission clustered on two well - separated red- and blue - shifted groups detached from the star and on each side of it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this clustered distribution were due to a single explosive event , we could expect a hubble flow to develop with time , but the gap between the maser emission and the central star would increase , and no emission would be detected close to the star . on the other hand ,",
    "a few other wfs @xcite show a more extended water maser distribution , with components close to the star , but no clear hubble - flow pattern is present .",
    "therefore , the mass - loss processes that give rise to water maser emission in i15103 seem to be completely different from all the other known wfs .",
    "we suggest that water maser emission in wfs that are still in the post - agb stage is pumped mainly by jets , and this emission is seen at the bow shock created by the jet ( in the cases where there are two separate clusters of water masers ) or along the body of the jet ( if there is a more continuous maser distribution ) . however , as the star enters the pn phase , high velocity water maser emission traces singular explosive events .",
    "this would indicate a fundamental change of the mass loss process in evolved stars around the end of the post - agb phase .",
    "this type of explosive event could be a common feature at the early stages of bipolar pne , as evidenced by the occurrence of hubble - like flows in these objects .",
    "the hubble - flow pattern in i15103 , however , is seen at a smaller scale ( @xmath143 au ) than in other pne and proto - pne , and it shows a steeper velocity gradient . in particular , the hubble flow in i15103 has a slope of @xmath144 km s@xmath2 arcsec@xmath2 , while it is @xmath145 km s@xmath2 arcsec@xmath2 in the pn ngc 6302 @xcite , which is at a similar distance ( 1.1 kpc ) . in the case of an explosive event , we expect this velocity gradient to decrease with time , since the ejected material will cover a larger spatial extension .",
    "the velocity pattern we see in i15013 could represent the earliest manifestations of explosive phenomena among pne and its precursors .",
    "we presented observations of radio continuum and water maser emission at 22 ghz , as well as submm co and mid - infrared spectra of the source iras 15103@xmath05754 , a candidate pn where single - dish observations had previously revealed a water maser spectrum that suggested the presence of a wf outflow .",
    "our main conclusions are as follow :    * water maser emission shows a wide velocity spread of @xmath1 km s@xmath2 , and it is spatially associated with the radio continuum emission .",
    "most of the water maser components are distributed following an elongated distribution , with an orientation similar to the nebula seen in the mid - ir , and tracing a collimated high - velocity outflow . *",
    "iras 15103@xmath05754 is confirmed as a pn , based on the absence of interstellar molecular emission close to the velocity of the source ( thus , ruling out it is a yso ) , and the presence of ionized material .",
    "the presence of a high velocity maser outflow indicates that the source is a wf , being the first known pn belonging to this class of objects .",
    "all previously known wfs were late agb or post - agb stars . *",
    "the velocity distribution of the maser emission shows a rough linear trend , with higher velocities farther away from the central star",
    ". such a `` hubble - like '' flow may be indicative of a short - lived , explosive event .",
    "this velocity pattern is not seen in other wfs , which are in previous evolutionary stages .",
    "* we suggest that water maser emission in wfs that are still in the post - agb stage is pumped mainly by shocks in jets . however , as the star enters the pn phase , high velocity water maser emission traces singular explosive events . this would represent an important change in the mass loss processes at the end of the post - agb phase .",
    "the `` hubble flow '' we detected at small scales ( @xmath143 au ) could be the first manifestation of explosive events , which seem to be a common feature in the kinematics of more evolved pne .",
