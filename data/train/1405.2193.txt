    "while we are used to think of a diffusion process in terms of the msd ( [ msd ] ) calculated as the spatial average of @xmath19 over the probability density function @xmath20 , single particle tracking experiments typically provide few but long individual time series @xmath21 .",

    "we find pronounced scatter between @xmath36 from individual trajectories even in the limit of extremely long trajectories @xmath39 @xcite , while for fbm the scatter vanishes for longer @xmath23 , a characteristic of the ergodic nature of fbm @xcite .",

    "it decreases with the ratio @xmath49 and thus indicates a reproducible behaviour between individual trajectories .",
    "the coexistence of the disparity @xmath52 and asymptotically vanishing ergodicity breaking parameter , @xmath53 is a new class of non - ergodic processes the more detailed mathematical nature of which remains to be examined .    from the analysis",
    "so far for free motion we can see that the sbm process has a truly split personality . thus its pdf is identical to that for free fbm .",

    "this scaling form @xmath55 exactly matches the result for ctrw subdiffusion @xcite or diffusion processes with space - dependent diffusivity @xcite . unlike the weakly non - ergodic dynamics of the latter two , for sbm the fluctuations around the mean @xmath56 measured by the distribution @xmath51 are narrow and decrease with longer @xmath23 .",
    "we now show that the behaviour of confined sbm is also unconventional .",
    "an important physical property of a stochastic process is its response to external forces or spatial confinement . from an experimental point of view , this is of relevance to tracer particles moving in the confines of cellular compartments or when the particle is traced by the help of optical tweezers , which exert an hookean restoring force on the particle @xcite .",
    "we study the paradigmatic case of an harmonic potential @xmath57 , for which the motion is governed by the fokker - planck equation @xmath58 which follows directly from the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) with the additional hookean force term @xmath59 .",
    "note that in absence of the external force ( @xmath60 ) this equation is that of batchelor @xcite .",
    "for the msd we find an exact expression in terms of the kummer function @xmath61 @xcite , @xmath62 from which we obtain the initial free subdiffusion ( [ msd ] ) for @xmath63 and the scaling form @xmath64 in the long time limit @xmath65 . for subdiffusion ( @xmath6 )",
    "the msd thus has a power - law decay to zero , while for superdiffusion ( @xmath16 ) it grows infinitely .",
    "this counterintuitive behaviour of sbm is due to the fact that the time dependence of the diffusivity @xmath66 corresponds to a time dependent temperature @xcite or a time dependent viscosity .",

    "[ harmtraj ] analyses this behaviour in the harmonic potential further by showing the time series @xmath21 for subdiffusive sbm , brownian motion , and superdiffusive sbm .",
    "indeed we see that for subdiffusive and superdiffusive confined sbm the fluctuations continue to decrease and increase with time , while those in the brownian limit become stationary .",
    "this is the direct effect of the time dependent temperature or viscosity encoded in the sbm diffusivity @xmath66 .",
    "if the system is stationary or thermalised this behaviour clearly underlines the unsuitability of sbm for the description of anomalous diffusion .",
    "the behaviour of sbm dynamics under confinement is the central result of our study .",
    "the continued temporal decay or increase of the msd that we obtained for sbm is in stark contrast to the behaviour of confined ctrw subdiffusion , for which the msd @xmath78 saturates to the thermal plateau , while the time averaged msd continues to grow in the power - law form @xmath79 up until the lag time @xmath24 approaches @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it strongly differs from fbm , which relaxes to a plateau for both the msd and the time averaged msd , and for which only a transient disparity between @xmath80 and @xmath26 exists @xcite .",
    "finally , sbm is also at variance with heterogeneous diffusion processes with a space dependent diffusion coefficient relax to a plateau for both @xmath78 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "as we showed sbm is a truly paradoxical stochastic process . somewhat similar to a chameleon , each time we compare sbm with other established anomalous diffusion processes we find certain similarities .",
    "looking at the sum of its features , however , sbm is a truly independent process with a range of remarkable properties .    for free sbm",
    "the probability density function @xmath20 equals that of fbm , despite the fact that both processes are governed by different stochastic ( langevin ) equations .",
    "sbm s time averaged msd scales equally to those of the weakly non - ergodic ctrw subdiffusion and diffusion processes with space - dependent diffusivity . despite this weakly non - ergodic character of the mean time averaged msd @xmath81 , the amplitude scatter between the time averaged msd @xmath26 of individual realisations is small and",
    "the distribution has a gaussian shape , as otherwise observed for the ergodic fbm or for brownian motion of finite time @xmath23 . in that sense sbm",
    "represents a new class of non - ergodic processes .",
    "the most striking behaviour of sbm is , however , its strongly non - stationary behaviour under confinement . instead of relaxing to a plateau",
    "the msd acquires a power - law decay or growth mirroring a continuously decreasing or increasing temperature encoded in sbm s time dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath66 .",
    "sbm is thus at variance with the currently available experimental observations in complex liquids using single particle tracking by video microscopy or by optical tweezers tracking of single submicron particles .",
    "thus the free anomalous diffusion data garnered so far was classified into fbm - like and ctrw - like behaviour , or combinations thereof @xcite .",
    "note that also for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments recent analysis tools corroborated an fbm nature of the data @xcite . for optical tweezers tracking of lipid granules in different complex liquids",
    "the time averaged msd either continues to grow under confinement , reflecting the non - ergodic features of ctrws @xcite , or it relaxes to a plateau value mirroring an ergodic dynamics @xcite .",
    "how can fbm and sbm have the same distribution ( [ prop ] ) in free space ?",
    "simply put for fbm , the viscoelastic properties of the environment effecting the long - range correlations of fbm lead to a frequency dependent response of the environment to a disturbance , while the materials properties remain unchanged in time . for free fbm",
    "this gives rise to the subdiffusive msd ( [ msd ] ) , in which the time dependent diffusivity effectively encodes the frequency dependent response of the viscoelastic environment .",
    "the distribution ( [ prop ] ) for fbm and its description in terms of a fokker - planck equation of the form ( [ fokker ] ) is treacherous , however .",
    "this can already be seen when we use the pdf ( [ prop ] ) or the dynamics equation ( [ fokker ] ) to calculate the first passage behaviour .",
    "this procedure leads to the wrong result @xcite , and the full analytical description of fbm in the presence of boundaries remains elusive , a difficulty imposed by the highly correlated fractional gaussian noise driving its langevin equation .",
    "in contrast , sbm , according to its langevin description ( [ langevin ] ) , is driven by uncorrelated noise but the environment itself is changing as function of time , effecting an extremely non - stationary process .",
    "the equivalence of the pdf ( [ prop ] ) of both processes is thus simply due to the fact that a gaussian pdf is completely defined by its second moment , the msd ( [ msd ] ) .    with its interesting behaviour that is so different from the other conventional anomalous diffusion models ,",
    "sbm may indeed have relevant applications to weakly coupled or fully adiabatic systems , as well as for active systems , in which the existence of a temperature is not meaningful .",
    "in particular , in the superdiffusive case sbm or analogous dynamics with other increasing effective diffusivities may represent an alternative approach to active brownian motion @xcite .    the difference of sbm to other processes",
    "can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ trajs ] . for the subdiffusive case a sample trajectory of sbm",
    "is compared to that of fbm and the noisy ctrw @xcite , in which the pure subdiffusive ctrw is superimposed with ornstein - uhlenbeck noise to accommodate the thermal noise of the environment observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "we see that sbm with its gaussian probability density function and uncorrelated driving noise appears more similar to the noisy ctrw motion , albeit it has a more pronounced tendency to reach larger amplitudes than the ctrw with its waiting time periods .",
    "the fluctuations of sbm are dramatically less than those of the anticorrelated fbm , which also shows the largest amplitudes in @xmath21 . for superdiffusion , we compare sbm with a noisy version of the lvy walk process @xcite and again with fbm .",
    "note the vastly different size of the window shown on the ordinate .",
    "this time , the persistent fbm shows pronouncedly larger excursions and a distinct reduction of the noise compared to sbm .",
    "the shape of @xmath21 of the latter does not appear to be qualitatively different from the subdiffusive case .",
    "the noisy ctrw is fundamentally different from both sbm and fbm . despite their disparate physical nature and their dissimilarity when setting one against the other in a direct comparison , we note that generally it is difficult to identify a stochastic process solely from the appearance of the recorded trajectory .",

    "sbm with its gaussian and uncorrelated nature appears deceivingly simple and is therefore easy to implement in numerical analyses and descriptions such as diffusion limited reactions .",
    "however , the other face of the medal is about the physical relevance of a model process .",
    "using sbm with its time - dependent diffusion coefficient violates the physical setting in typical experiments , in which the system is held at approximately constant temperature and its predictions are at odds with actual observations .",
    "the unphysical nature for the kind of processes we have in mind is most obvious for confined motion .",
    "in contrast , fbm and fractional langevin equation motion are ergodic processes with the physical background of an effective particle motion in a viscoelastic multi - body environment .",
    "fbm and fractional langevin equation motion exhibit a transient disparity between the msd and the time averaged msd under confinement @xcite .",
    "weakly non - ergodic ctrw processes emerge due to immobilisation periods imprinted on the dynamics by the structure of the environment of binding events to the environment .",
    "finally , diffusion processes with space dependent diffusivities arise naturally in non - homogeneous systems such as biological cells or subsurface aquifers . to extract physically meaningful information from anomalous diffusion data one needs to have some physical insight into the observed process and",
