    "a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is one of the most attractive candidates for dark matter ( dm ) , motivated by new physics at a @xmath1 scale , including supersymmetric ( susy ) theories .",
    "dm is produced thermally in the early universe , and its abundance can be consistent with that observed , if the reheating temperature of the universe is sufficiently larger than its freeze - out temperature .",
    "the coincidence of the observed dark matter density and the relic density determined by the weak interaction scale is referred to as the wimp miracle .",
    "since this scenario requires the mass of the wimp at the electroweak or @xmath1 scale , there are rich implications for near - future experiments , including direct and indirect detection experiments of dm and particle collider experiments .    however , when we look at each model motivated by particle physics , it is nontrivial to obtain a correct mass spectrum that can account for the abundance of dm .",
    "for example , in the constrained minimal susy standard model , the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is bino - like .",
    "non - observation of susy particles and the discovery of the 126  gev higgs boson  @xcite by the lhc experiment indicate that susy particles are heavy , which leads to overproduction of the bino - like lsp in the early universe .",
    "taking this situation seriously , we reconsider the assumption of high reheating temperature .",
    "when we consider inflationary models , a scenario with a low reheating temperature is naturally realized as follows .",
    "the inflaton is required to have a very flat potential , which suggests some symmetry to control its potential .",
    "the symmetry naturally suppresses interactions of the inflaton , which in turn leads to a low reheating temperature of the universe .",
    "for example , if the mass of the inflaton is of the order of @xmath2 gev and it decays through a dimension six planck - suppressed operator , the reheating temperature of the universe is less than about @xmath3 gev , which is smaller than typical freeze - out temperatures of wimps .",
    "in a scenario with a low reheating temperature , the thermal abundance of dm is much less than a scenario with high reheating temperature , mainly because the energy density of the thermal plasma is a subdominant component of that of the universe at the time of dm freeze out  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the thermal abundance of dm is diluted by the entropy production from the inflaton decay .",
    "however , the entropy production itself provides dm  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they have indicated that dm is produced in a shower from the decay of the inflaton and have calculated the resultant dm energy density using generalized dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equations  @xcite in a certain susy model .",
    "they have found that dm is produced efficiently through this process when the inflaton decays into particles carrying a non - zero @xmath4 charge .",
    "the dm abundance also depends on the mass of inflaton , and the number of dm produced per one inflaton decay is typically @xmath0 for the inflaton mass of @xmath5 gev .",
    "in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been pointed out that dm is produced by inelastic scatterings between the thermal plasma and high - energy particles produced by the inflaton decay .",
    "therefore , in a scenario with low reheating temperature , the total amount of dm is given by the sum of the following contributions : ( suppressed ) thermal production , production through a cascade shower from the inflaton decay , and production through inelastic scatterings between high - energy particles and the thermal plasma .",
    "the last contribution is closely related to thermalization processes in the era of reheating , which has to be investigated in detail .",
    "when reheating temperature is low enough , the typical momentum of particles produced by the decay of inflaton , which is roughly given by the mass of the inflaton , is much larger than the ( would - be ) temperature of background plasma . in this case , the thermalization process is completed by splitting processes through which the number of high - energy particles drastically increases  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "the rate of splitting processes is suppressed by the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect , which is a destructive interference effect between emission processes  @xcite .",
    "the increases in the number of high - energy particles as well as the lpm effect should be taken into account in the estimation of the dm abundance produced through inelastic processes .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the abundance of dm produced from inelastic scatterings between high - energy particles and the thermal plasma with careful consideration on the thermalization process as mentioned above .",
    "the resultant dm abundance is independent of the mass of the inflaton as long as the mass is sufficiently large , and depends mainly on the mass scale of the dm sector and reheating temperature .",
    "we find that this is the dominant contribution to the amount of dm in a scenario with a low reheating temperature when the mass of the inflaton is sufficiently large .",
    "we should emphasize that this mechanism to produce dm is highly model independent .",
    "even if the decay channel of the inflaton into dm is absent in particular , dm is produced through inelastic scatterings .",
    "in addition , this scenario can also account for the abundance of dm with mass of @xmath3 pev , which is larger than unitarity bound of a few hundred tev  @xcite .",
    "such heavy dm might account for the recent observation of high - energy cosmic - ray neutrinos by the icecube experiment  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain how high - energy particles lose their energy in the thermal plasma taking account of the lpm effect .",

    "inelastic ~_elastic ~ , where we implicitly assume that daughter particles are massless .",
    "one may consider that the rate of the splitting process is simply given by @xmath18 .",
    "however , we have to take account of an interference effect among emission processes , known as the lpm effect  @xcite . as we show below",

    "this is a physical origin of the lpm effect .",

    "further , since standard model particles are continuously supplied by the decay of the inflaton and immediately participate in splitting processes , @xmath161 becomes a constant in time ( up to a slow variation due to the red shift of the source term ) as long as the source term is present , that is , @xmath162 .",

    "the distribution function @xmath169 represents the distribution of particles that is produced from the source and evolves through inelastic scattering during the time of @xmath170 .",
