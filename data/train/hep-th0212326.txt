    "cosmological constant @xmath4 was originally introduced in general relativity with the motivation to allow static homogeneous universe to einstein equations in the presence of matter .",
    "once expansion of the universe was discovered , its role turned out to be unnecessary and it experienced a checkered history .",
    "recent cosmological observations suggest some evidences for the existence of a positive cosmological constant  @xcite  : from a variety of observational sources , its magnitude is @xmath5 , and both matter @xmath6 and vacuum @xmath7 are of comparable magnitude , @xmath8 in spatially flat universe .",
    "both results are paraphrased as old and new cosmological constant problems  @xcite .",
    "inclusion of quantum field theory predicts naturally the energy density via quantum fluctuations even up to the planck scale , so the old problem is to understand why the observed present cosmological constant is so small .",
    "it is the worst fine - tuning problem requiring a magic cancellation with accuracy to 120 decimal places .",
    "the new problem is to understand why the vacuum energy density is comparable to the present mass density of the universe .",
    "though there are several classes of efforts to solve the cosmological constant problem , e.g. , cancellation of vacuum energy based on symmetry principle like supersymmetry , the idea of quintessence , and the anthropic principle , any of them is not widely accepted as the solution , yet . in the early universe , existing cosmological constant also provides an intriguing idea , inflationary cosmology , to fix long - standing cosmological problems in the big - bang scenario .",
    "in addition to the above , detailed properties of the de sitter geometry in arbitrary dimensions raise a debate like selection of true vacuum compatible with its scale symmetry in relation with trans - planckian cosmology  @xcite or becomes a cornerstone of a theoretical idea like ds / cft for a challenging problem of quantum gravity in de sitter spacetime  @xcite .    in the context of general relativity , classical study on the cosmological constant is to understand geometry of de sitter spacetime ( ds@xmath9 ) .",

    "we introduce our setup with notations and signature . in section 3 ,",
    "four coordinates ( global , conformal , planar , and static ) and coordinate transformations among those are explained with the reason why such four of them are frequently used .",
    "killing symmetries are also obtained in each coordinate system . all possible geodesic motions of classical test particle are given in section 4 .",
