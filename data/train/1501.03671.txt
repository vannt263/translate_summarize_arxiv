    "the hexatriynyl radical c@xmath3h , a member of the linear c@xmath5h series , belongs to the spectroscopically best studied carbon chain radicals .",
    "the x@xmath1 ground state was studied extensively in fourier - transform microwave ( mw ) studies , yielding accurate constants @xcite .",
    "the laboratory data followed astronomical detections of this molecule in the cold dense cloud tmc-1 @xcite .",
    "later this molecule was detected along other lines of sight as well , e.g. towards the carbon rich star irc+10216 @xcite .",
    "the b@xmath0x@xmath1 electronic spectrum of c@xmath3h was reported in several studies .",
    "the first data were recorded in ne matrix isolation studies after mass selective deposition ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this provided approximate values for the gas phase absorptions .",
    "the first gas phase spectrum was obtained under somewhat poor experimental conditions , using a hollow cathode discharge cell @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum only showed unresolved features , including many bands starting from vibrationally excited states .",
    "subsequently , high precision and rotationally resolved spectra were recorded using a new planar plasma source design @xcite that allowed the detection of rotationally cold c@xmath3h and c@xmath3d transients under nearly doppler - free conditions @xcite . combined with sensitive detection techniques , such as cavity ring - down spectroscopy",
    ", it was possible to realize excellent s / n ratios , not only for the origin band but also for transitions involving vibrationally excited levels in the upper electronic state . in combination with the available mw constants it was possible to derive precise upper state constants , for both spin - orbit components .",
    "recently , a substantially extended study of these electronic bands , as well as new transitions involving vibronic hot bands was presented , with a focus on renner - teller effects in c@xmath3h @xcite . in the present work",
    "we extend previous spectroscopic studies to the fully @xmath2c - substituted isotopologue @xmath2c@xmath3h .",
    "the rotationally resolved electronic spectrum yields accurate spectroscopic constants , also including the ground state constants that have not been determined before .",
    "we follow an established method that has been used successfully to record electronic spectra of many different carbon chain radicals before .",
    "details of the experimental setup and experimental procedures are available from @xcite .",
    "supersonically jet - cooled @xmath2c@xmath3h radicals are produced  among other species  in a pulsed ( @xmath610 hz ) planar or pinhole plasma expansion generated by discharging a high pressure ( 10 bar ) gas pulse comprising of 0.18% @xmath2c - enriched ( 99% purity ) c@xmath4h@xmath4 in a helium : argon @xmath685:15 mixture . both slit and pinhole discharge nozzles , which have been used to study @xmath7c@xmath3h in ref .",
    "@xcite , are employed in the present experiment . the 3 cm @xmath8 300 @xmath9",
    "m slit discharge nozzle , with typical discharge i / v values of @xmath6100 ma/@xmath10750 v per jaw , is used to generate a planar plasma expansion with a nearly doppler - free environment and a relatively long effective absorption path length .",
    "the pinhole nozzle system , with typical i / v @xmath680 ma/@xmath101000 v values , generates a plasma expansion suffering from a somewhat larger doppler width , but allows measuring spectra with different rotational temperatures in a more convenient way .",
    "final rotational temperatures typically amount to 15 - 30 k.    the @xmath2c@xmath3h spectra are recorded in direct absorption using cavity ring - down laser spectroscopy .",
    "tunable light around 525 nm  the region where regular c@xmath3h has been found  is generated using a nd : yag pumped pulsed dye laser ( @xmath66 ns pulse duration ) .",
    "the bandwidth of the dye laser is @xmath60.035 @xmath11 , well below the expected line splitting between two adjacent rotational transitions .",
    "the light pulse is spatially filtered and enters a 58 cm long optical cavity comprising of two high reflection mirrors .",
    "the optical axis is aligned a few mm downstream , parallel to the slit or below the pinhole of the nozzle .",
    "light leaking out of the cavity is recorded by a photo - multiplier tube and a spectrum is obtained by recording the ring - down time as function of the laser wavelength",
    ". typical ring - down times amount to 40 - 100 @xmath9s .",
    "a precise pulse generator coordinates that the gas and the discharge pulse , and as well as the ring - down event , coincide . simultaneously with the spectral recordings of @xmath2c@xmath3h , transmission fringes of an etalon ( with a free spectral range of @xmath620.1 ghz ) are recorded , providing relative frequency markers to correct for a possible non - linear wavelength scanning of the dye laser .",
    "an iodine spectrum allows an absolute wavelength calibration with an accuracy better than 0.02 @xmath11 .",
    "in figure 1 the b@xmath0x@xmath1 electronic origin band ( @xmath12 ) transition of regular c@xmath3h ( upper panel ) and of @xmath2c@xmath3h ( lower panel ) is shown .",
    "the newly recorded @xmath7c@xmath3h spectrum compares well with data presented in @xcite . from a comparison of both panels",
    "it can be concluded that the @xmath2c - sample is highly pure , as nearly no features due to @xmath7c contamination can be clearly seen .",
    "some extra lines in the lower panel  recorded through the slit expansion ",
    "are due to overlapping hot band transitions of other small hydrocarbons in the plasma .",
    "previous work has shown that these lines become much weaker using the pinhole discharge nozzle , as visible from the corresponding spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that in contrast to the pinhole nozzle experiments in @xcite , the final doppler width of individual transitions is smaller , mainly because of the reduced expansion velocity of the jet that is run with more argon in the gas mixture .",
    "the overall spectral pattern of @xmath2c@xmath3h is very similar to that of @xmath7c@xmath3h , with a blue shift of @xmath62 @xmath11 .",
    "both spectra consist of two components , each with ( fully resolved ) p , q and ( partially resolved ) r branches , reflecting transitions between the two spin - orbit components : b@xmath13x@xmath14 and b@xmath15x@xmath16 .",
    "the two band systems are split by @xmath17a = @xmath18a@xmath19a@xmath20 , the difference between the spin - orbit splitting in ground and excited state .",
    "an assignment of the individual spin - orbit components is straightforward ; with a low final temperature in the jet expansion , the more intense component corresponds to a transition from the lower spin - orbit state , i.e. x@xmath14 for c@xmath3h .",
    "the observation of the barely visible q - branch in the b@xmath15x@xmath16 system provides further evidence for this assignment , as the intensity of the q - branch scales quadratically with the value of the spin - orbit angular momenta ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the detailed rotational assignments for @xmath2c@xmath3h are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the determined transition energies of the 116 assigned lines listed in table 1 are used to fit five parameters . for regular c@xmath3h",
    "a full analysis has been presented before @xcite , guided by accurate ground state constants available from mw work @xcite .",
    "the focus here is on @xmath2c@xmath3h for which ground state constants are not available ; it is important , therefore , to realize that ground and excited state parameters may correlate in a fit .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     as no mw data for the ground state exists , it is wise to check for possible correlations between the resulting ground and upper state parameters using a global fit .",
    "indeed , the fitted values for a and b give high correlation coefficients ( 1.000 and 0.997 , respectively ) .",
    "for this , combination differences for both ground and excited state have been fitted separately .",
    "the resulting molecular parameters are summarized as fit - ii in table 2 .",
    "as can be seen , the derived values for ( b@xmath22 , a@xmath22 ) and ( b@xmath23 , a@xmath23 ) are in good agreement with those derived from fit - i .",
    "a simulated spectrum using these constants is incorporated in the lower panel of figure 1 .",
    "the overall pattern reproduces well for a rotational temperature of t~rot~ = 20.3(1 ) k. this not only applies to the boltzmann contour , but also to the relative intensity ratio of the two spin - orbit components , indicating that the spin - orbit relaxation is as effective as the rotational cooling .",
    "the fitted band origin of the b@xmath0x@xmath1 band of @xmath2c@xmath3h is roughly 2.35 @xmath11 blue shifted with respect to the main isotopologue .",
    "the rotational constant b@xmath22(@xmath2c@xmath3h ) is found to be 7.4% smaller than that of b@xmath22(@xmath7c@xmath3h ) , fully consistent with predictions from the previously determined c@xmath3h structure in ref",
    ". @xcite . upon electronic excitation",
    ", the value of b@xmath23 decreases , indicating that the molecule stretches , but as the inter - atomic forces are expected to barely change , the b@xmath23/b@xmath22 ratios for @xmath24c@xmath3h are nearly the same .",
    "it should be noted that the effective spin - orbit splitting constants ( @xmath18a@xmath20 and @xmath18a@xmath25 ) for @xmath2c@xmath3h are smaller than those for @xmath7c@xmath3h .",
    "this may be due to a different renner - teller effect ( i.e. , the electronic orbital - vibration interaction ) in @xmath2c@xmath3h .",
    "indeed , spin - orbit coupling can be significantly affected by renner - teller effects and as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath7c@xmath3h a very strong renner - teller effect exists .",
