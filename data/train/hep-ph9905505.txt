    "the aim of this introductory talk is to summarize the recent results in _ polarized deep inelastic scattering . _ after a brief reminder of experimental aspects specific to spin physics , we will review successively the new results on the transverse spin structure function @xmath1 , the evaluation of the first moments @xmath2 for the proton and the neutron , the ongoing tests of the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule , the fits of the @xmath3 evolution of @xmath0 in perturbative qcd and the semi - inclusive asymmetries of charged hadrons .",
    "in general the data mentionned in this review have become public during the last year either in articles or in preprints .",
    "more recent ( and therefore unpublished ) data will be discussed in the spin session and summarized in the conclusions of this workshop .",
    "in contrast with unpolarized experiments which measure cross sections , polarized dis experiments measure spin asymmetries @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the spin dependent and the spin averaged cross sections : @xmath7 ( the arrows correspond to the respective orientations of the beam and target particle spins ) . + the physics asymmetry @xmath8 is equal to the measured one divided by the beam and target polarizations and by a factor @xmath9 accounting for the fraction of polarizable nucleons in the target : @xmath10 the uncertainties on the factors @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath9 are important sources of systematic error on the spin asymmetry @xmath8 and on the spin structure functions .",
    "+ the characteristics of recent ( @xmath13 1990 ) spin experiments , including the average values of the beam and target polarizations and the corresponding errors , are listed in table  [ tab : charac ] .",
    "accuracies of 2 to 3 @xmath14 are presently achieved for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "+    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in its most simplified form the dilution factor @xmath9 is the ratio of the number of polarizable nucleons in the target by the total number of nucleons ( e.g.@xmath15 for @xmath16 ) .",
    "more accurately , the numbers of nucleons of various types must be weighted by the corresponding cross sections , e.g. in the case of a proton target @xmath17 with the sum in the denominator running over all target nuclei .",
    "+ a significant dependence of the dilution factor on the scaling variable @xmath18 is generated by the variation of @xmath19 vs. @xmath18 as well as by the emc effect modifying the cross section for nucleons bound in a nucleus .",
    "+ in particular , the large radiative cross section at small @xmath18 in nuclei sharply reduces the value of @xmath9 for @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , a further decrease is produced by radiative corrections to the cross section on the polarized nucleon itself .",
    "+ the measured asymmetry on a polarized proton target can be rewritten as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the one - photon exchange cross section and @xmath23 the total cross section including radiative effects . due to radiative corrections ,",
    "the spin dependent cross section @xmath24 slightly differs from @xmath25 and the previous formula becomes @xmath26 showing that the `` effective dilution factor '' is @xmath27 in the case of the smc ammonia target , @xmath28 drops to about @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "+ the effective dilution factor can however be significantly enhanced by restricting the sample to events where a hadron is detected in the final state @xcite . in this case , the elastic tail does not contribute to the radiative corrections .",
    "the resulting increase of @xmath28 at low @xmath18 largely compensates the reduction of the number of events in the data sample so that more accurate values of the asymmetry @xmath8 are obtained . for the smc kinematics ,",
    "this condition was found to be true for @xmath31 . as an exemple",

    "the spin asymmetry ( 1 ) is related to the virtual photon asymmetries @xmath32 and @xmath33 by the following relations which refer to configurations where the beam and target polarizations are parallel or perpendicular : @xmath34 the depolarization factor of the virtual photon @xmath35 depends on the ratio of the cross sections for longitudinally and transversely polarized photons @xmath36 while the other factors @xmath37 only depend on the event kinematics .",
    "the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are subject to the positivity conditions : @xmath38 the spin structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are obtained from the virtual photon asymmetries @xmath32 , @xmath33 and from the spin independent structure function @xmath39 : @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "+ when @xmath42 and @xmath43 are both measured , as in the slac experiments , these relations fully determine @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "+ the uncertainties on the factors @xmath11,@xmath12 and @xmath9 induce a normalisation error of about @xmath47 on all values of @xmath32 and @xmath0 . in addition,@xmath32",
    "is affected by the uncertainty on @xmath48 , which varies with the kinematic variables and becomes important in regions where @xmath49 is poorly constrained .",
    "this uncertainty partially cancels out in @xmath0 but the spin structure function is further affected by the uncertainty on @xmath50 which is of the order of @xmath47 ( including a normalisation error of about @xmath51 ) .",
    "exploratory measurements of @xmath33 have been performed by the smc in 1994 - 1996 for the proton and deuteron targets .",

    "= 5 gev@xmath60 and for the range of the measurements ( @xmath63 ) , the combined slac data give values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the proton and the deuteron respectively , in agreement with the bc prediction .",

    "at the same @xmath3 and for the same @xmath18 range , the slac data give @xmath69 , in good agreement with the elt prediction .",
    "more accurate results on @xmath1 are expected in the near future from experiment e155x which is finishing its data taking at slac .",

    "+ the difficulty to determine the gluon spin distribution from the @xmath3 evolution of @xmath0 has lead to an increased interest for reactions dominated by photon - gluon fusion , a process which gives access to @xmath186 with a large analysis power .",
    "the compass experiment , planned to start at cern in the year 2000 , intends to determine @xmath186 from open charm production @xcite using the full virtual photon flux down to @xmath105 and also from events where a pair of high @xmath187 hadrons is produced .",
    "the slac experiment e155 has studied the reactions @xmath188 with circularly polarized photons @xcite . in these reactions ,",
    "the sensitivity to the gluon spin distribution could also be enhanced due to the photon - gluon process .",
    "small asymmetries significantly different from zero have been observed for positive and negative hadrons produced on the proton target while the asymmetries on the deuteron target are consistent with zero .",
    "the interpretation of these results remains difficult because the event kinematics is unknown and many different processes may contribute .",
    "the field of spin physics has been characterized in 98 - 99 by a rather limited amount of new data but very extensive work to finalize the analysis of previous experiments . besides the ongoing analyses of spin structure functions in perturbative qcd , there has been a diversification of interest towards the non - perturbative low @xmath3 region and photoproduction , including the long awaited test of the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule .",
    "+ hadron asymmetries have become a major subject of interest due to the precise data obtained by hermes .",
    "+ the transverse asymmetry @xmath33 is now well measured and found to be different from zero for the proton .",
    "its compatibility with the twist-2 contribution will be further investigated with the most recent slac data . + it is a pleasure to thank my colleagues and friends from the smc for many fruitful discussions over many years .",
    "i also like to thank colleagues from other collaborations who have kindly provided information about their experiment during the preparation of this talk , in particular a.brll ( hermes ) , e. hughes ( e155 ) , z .- e .",
