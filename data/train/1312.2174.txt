    "entanglement and superposition are distinctive quantum mechanical features which can be used to surpass the limitations of classical information processing @xcite .",
    "the physical and technological impact of these effects are so large that entanglement is considered as a resource , in the same way as energy .",
    "entanglement is classified @xcite , quantified @xcite , manipulated @xcite and distributed @xcite .",
    "even various types of networks of entangled states are being investigated @xcite . like any other resource , it is questioned whether this is the only resource which we can rely on , or there are other cheaper and less fragile resources which can be equally effective in at least certain subclasses of our quantum communication tasks .",
    "it is now known that there are indeed separable states which do have some type of quantum correlations @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the same type of study as mentioned above , has begun to emerge for these kinds of states @xcite .",
    "for example , questions like : how much correlation exist in a separable state , how such a correlation can be produced , how robust it is against noise , and whether or not this correlation can be distilled are of conceptual and practical relevance . in this paper",
    "we want to investigate some of these questions for an important class of states , namely two qubit mixed states with maximally mixed marginals or the so - called bell diagonal states .",
    "while we do a rather general study of these states and their properties , we would like to emphasize the interplay of two specific factors , namely the method of preparation and the amount of quantum correlations in these states . to present the problem definitely ,",
    "consider a smaller subclass , namely werner states @xcite which are defined as : [ wernerall ] w(t)= i + t|^-^-| , where @xmath0 is the singlet state @xmath1 .",
    "the importance of these states stems from the fact any two qubit state can be converted to a werner state by bi - local unitary operations @xcite .",
    "it is well known that such a state is separable when the parameter @xmath2 is restricted to the range @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "+ for concreteness , consider the case where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where we denote the states @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively by @xmath8 and @xmath9 . these states are separable and can be decomposed respectively as follows : @xmath10 and @xmath11 therefore for @xmath12 , a werner state is a uniform mixture of parallel spins and for @xmath4 , it is a uniform mixture of anti - parallel spins . at a first glance , it seems that there is not much difference between the above two states .",
    "however , as we will see , these two states have different amount of quantum correlations , and have different efficiency in performing certain quantum communication tasks .",
    "thinking of them as resources , we may ask the following questions : +    *   which of the above two states has higher value of quantum correlation and what is the origin of it ? + *   which of the above states is more useful for quantum communication tasks ? *   which one is harder to prepare by local operations and classical communication ? *   which one is more robust under local noise ?    we will try to present comprehensive answers to these questions . to this end we study them in the more general setting of one - parameter family of werner states which we write as follows :    @xmath13    and @xmath14 analyzing the one parameter family of states in ( [ wuu ] ) and ( [ wud ] ) gives us a comprehensive answer to the questions above .",
    "note that our analysis is not restricted to the case of werner states , in fact we study all separable two qubit states with maximally mixed marginals with regard to the above four questions and in some discussions we specifically analyze the one parameter family of ( [ wuu ] ) and ( [ wud ] ) in order to illustrate our results .",
    "+ stated briefly , we show that the set of separable two qubit states with maximally mixed marginals can be divided to two non - equivalent classes which are joint to each other in a measure zero subset .",
    "the states of one class are mixtures of maximally mixed state with parallel spins along the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17-axes while the states of the other subset are mixtures of maximally mixed state with anti - parallel spins along the same axes , hence we use the notation @xmath18 and @xmath19 to represent the corresponding elements of these classes respectively ( consider ( [ w ] ) and ( [ w ] ) as special cases ) .",
    "+ after a short discussion about the importance of the preparation of separable quantum correlated states , we will present a preparation method for all such states and discuss that our method is more efficient than the recently proposed one @xcite .",
    "we also find that the states @xmath18 have more quantum correlation content than @xmath19 as measured by local quantum uncertainty @xcite .",
    "this is intriguing in view of the fact that both these states are prepared by acting on two equally classically correlated states by identical quantum channels .",
    "we relate this difference to a hidden classical correlation which is needed for setting up aligned coordinate systems by the two parties in order to enact the correlated quantum channel .",
    "it turns out that for producing parallel states @xmath18 a more precise alignment is necessary compared with the case when one wants to produce anti - parallel states @xmath19 .",
    "this extra classical correlation is what goes into the total quantum correlation of the parallel states .",
    "of course one can argue that the state @xmath19 can be prepared ( at less cost ) and then covered to @xmath18 by an optimal not operation @xcite .",
    "but as we will show , a successful conversion via the optimal not ( with good fidelity ) also amounts to having more initial classical correlations for preparation of @xmath18 .",
    "it should be noted that while our preparation method requires a set of agreed up on coordinate axes by the two parties , it does not concern the aligning process of the axes .",
    "in fact there are different methods for setting up a reference frame ( see the review article @xcite and the references inscribed ) , for example two distant parties may use pure parallel or anti - parallel spin states to set up an agreed up on coordinate system @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we will discuss that our problem and the problem of reference frames concern different issues in the field of quantum information .",
    "precisely , some literature of reference frames are about efficient use of quantum resources for transmission of a reference frame @xcite and some are about quantum communication without having a precise reference frame @xcite , while in this paper we do not use the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 for setting up a reference frame or for quantum communication between two distant parties .",

    "we calculate and compare the quantum correlations of the desired states .",
    "we then present a preparation method for separable states in section ( [ preparation ] ) .",
    "equipped with these tools , in sections ( [ origin ] ) we discuss about the origin of the correlation difference of the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in section ( [ optnotsection ] )",
    "we present an alternative preparation method which is based on the action of the optimal not operator . afterward in section ( [ effect ] ) we compare the effectiveness of the states of the two classes in a quantum information task , more precisely we present an entanglement distribution protocol with werner states .",
    "we also study the effect of depolarizing noise on these states in this section .",
    "finally we end the paper with a discussion in section ( [ discussion ] ) .",
    "since we want to analyze the set of two qubit states with maximally mixed marginals with regard to the questions we asked in the introduction , in this section we berifely present some preliminary facts about such states .",
    "these states can be written as : [ maxmix ] = ( i+t_ij_i_j ) , where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are pauli matrices and summation over repeated indices is understood . by local unitary actions",
    ", the matrix @xmath22 can be diagonalized : [ diagt ] = ( i+_i=1 ^ 3t_i_i_i ) .",
    "let us denote the space of such states by @xmath23 . to ensure positivity",
    ", the parameters @xmath24 should be confined within a regular tetrahedron , whose vertices are given by the vectors @xmath25 not all the states in this tetrahedron are separable . to be a separable state , the parameters @xmath24",
    "should be restricted to a regular octahedron inscribed in the above tetrahedron .",
    "the vertices of this octahedron are given by @xmath26    the local unitary action of part a ( alice ) by a pauli matrix @xmath27 changes the signs of @xmath28 and @xmath29 while leaving the sign of @xmath30 intact .",
    "a similar thing happens with other local pauli operators . therefore depending on the sign of @xmath31",
    ", @xmath23 is divided into two inequivalent classes of states denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the representative elements of these classes are respectively as follows :    [ rhouu ] ^= ( i+t_1_1_1+t_2_2_2+t_3_3_3 ) , 0t_1 , t_2 , t_31 , and [ rhoud ] ^u= ( i - t_1_1_1-t_2_2_2-t_3_3_3 ) , 0t_1 , t_2 , t_31 , both subject to the condition @xmath34 ( needed for positivity of the matrix ) .",
    "as we will show , the states ( [ rhouu ] ) and ( [ rhoud ] ) are constructed from a mixture of maximally mixed state and parallel ( @xmath35 ) or anti - parallel ( @xmath36 ) spins respectively , and this is the reason for the notation that we have used .",
    "note that these two sets are joined to each other along a subset of measure zero , where @xmath37 . since any state of the form ( [ maxmix ] ) can be converted to ( [ rhouu ] ) or ( [ rhoud ] ) by local unitary actions , in order to study the correlation properties of general two - qubit states of the form ( [ maxmix ] ) , we need only study the properties of these special classes .",
    "+ first let us decompose these two states to a convex combination of pure states , this decomposition shows their difference in a transparent way and turns out to be important in our subsequent discussion . to do this",
    ", we define the pure states :    p_i^=(i_i ) , and note that @xmath38 can be written in two different ways in terms of product of these pure states , namely : [ sigma - uu ] _",
    "i_i=2(p_i^+p_i^++p_i^-p_i^-)-i , or [ sigma - ud ] _",
    "i_i = i-2(p_i^+p_i^-+p_i^-p_i^+ ) .",
    "in order to write the states ( [ rhouu ] ) and ( [ rhoud ] ) as a convex combination of product states , we use one of the above formulas as appropriate .",
    "one finds that    [ uudecom ] ^ = ( ( 1-t_1-t_2-t_3)i+_i=1 ^ 3 2t_i(p_i^+p_i^++p_i^-p_i^- ) ) and [ uddecom ] ^u = ( ( 1-t_1-t_2-t_3)i+_i=1 ^ 3 2t_i(p_i^+p_i^-+p_i^-p_i^+ ) ) .",
    "+ therefore @xmath18 is a mixture of maximally mixed state with a convex combination of states of parallel spins along the three axes @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , while @xmath19 is a mixture of maximally mixed states and a combination of anti - parallel spin states along the same axes .",
    "when one of the parameters @xmath24 say @xmath39 , the two states are locally convertible to each other , i. e. @xmath40 .",
    "this is in fact due to the existence of a universal not operator for equatorial states , which is nothing but the @xmath41 operator .",
    "this operator can easily reverse the orientation of any spin state in the equatorial plane : i.e. @xmath42 the same is also true if any other parameters @xmath30 or @xmath28 are zero .",
    "however , when all the parameters are different from zero , the two states @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not exactly convertible to each other , due to the non - existence of a universal not operator .",
    "+ * remark : * although a universal not operation does not exist @xcite , one can come close to it with arbitrary fidelity .",
    "in fact in @xcite it is shown that such an optimal not operator can be constructed by first estimating a state from @xmath43 copies of a given state @xmath44 ( with fidelity @xmath45 ) and then preparing the complement state @xmath46 .",
    "we will further discuss this in section ( [ optnotsection ] ) .",
    "+ we will see that the two states @xmath47 and @xmath48 , although very similar to each other , do not have the same performance in quantum information processing tasks .",
    "in fact this is due to the difference in their quantum correlation content .",
    "the origin of this difference is subtle and we will argue why this is so , after we have shown how these two states can be prepared from a classically correlated state .",
    "before doing this we compare these states with regard to their quantum correlation content .",
    "for a bipartite system , quantum correlation can be defined as the difference between the total and classical correlations @xcite .",
    "total correlation is equal to the mutual information of the bipartite system , and the classical correlation is defined to be the maximum amount of information that can be attained from the whole system by performing local measurements on one of the two subsystems @xcite .",
    "naturally calculation of quantum correlation requires a formidable optimization which can be carried out only for a restricted class of states @xcite . as substitutes ,",
    "other computable measures have been proposed in the literature .",
    "some are based on geometric approaches and are defined as the distance between a given state and the closest classically correlated state @xcite , others are based on fidelity with such a state @xcite , or on non - commutativity of reduced density matrices of one of the parties @xcite .",
    "the most recent one is based on the local quantum uncertainty for observables of one part , the uncertainty being related to the correlations in a bi - partite state .",
    "this measure is denoted by @xmath49 and it has a closed form for @xmath50 by @xmath51 dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "note that the geometric measure of correlation @xcite can easily be computed for the states ( [ rhouu ] ) and ( [ rhoud ] ) , in fact regarding to this correlation measure both these states have the same amount of correlations .",
    "nevertheless we do not use this correlation measure since it has the undesirable property of increasing under local reversible operations of part @xmath52 @xcite . in this section",
    "we consider @xmath49 to compare the correlation content of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for our discussion",
    "it is also important to pay attention to a discrete measure of correlation , called rank @xcite which shows how much useful a state is for a specific quantum processing task @xcite , we will discuss about this measure in section ( [ preparation ] ) .",
    "( note that a quantum correlation measure need not to be symmetric with respect to two parties , here we calculate the correlations with regard to part a ) .",
    "+ the definition of local quantum uncertainty ( lqu ) is based on the observation that the existence of correlation with a far away party @xmath52 , prevents exact determination of even a single observable in a state possessed by a party @xmath53 .",
    "it is defined as @xcite    [ lqudef ] _",
    "a()=_k_a ( , k_a i_b ) , in which @xmath54 is an observable on part @xmath53 and ( , k)=- tr\\{[^,k]^2 } , is called the skew information @xcite . for a @xmath55 dimensional system , ( [ lqudef ] ) can be cast into a closed form and is given by @xcite    _ a()=1-_max\\{w } , where @xmath56 denotes the largest eigenvalue , and @xmath57 is a symmetric matrix with elements w_ij = tr\\{^ ( _ i i ) ^ ( _ j i ) } , with @xmath58 .",
    "+ for the state ( [ rhouu ] ) , the square root of the density matrix can be calculated in closed form .",
    "lengthy but straightforward calculation gives the local quantum uncertainty in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath18 , which are _ 0=(1-t_1-t_2-t_3),_1=(1-t_1+t_2+t_3),_2=(1+t_1-t_2+t_3),_3=(1+t_1+t_2-t_3 ) .",
    "the final result is [ lquuu ] lqu(^)=1-_i\\{w_i } , in which [ wi ] w_i&=&2(+)&= & ( + ) , and the summations in the subscripts are done in mod 3 .",
    "correspondingly for @xmath19 , we use the same formula as in ( [ wi ] ) , with all @xmath24 replaced with @xmath59 .",
    "the important point now is that for the general case this measure is not symmetric under the change @xmath60 , but when one of the @xmath24 s is equal to zero lqu will be the same for both types of the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 . to see this explicitly , let us fix one of the @xmath24 s say @xmath39",
    ". then we find from ( [ wi ] ) that w_1&=&(+),w_2&=&(+),w_3&=&(+ ) , which in view of ( [ lquuu ] ) , clearly shows the symmetry @xmath61 . this is to be expected owing to the fact that when @xmath39 , a local transformation ( @xmath62 ) , turns @xmath18 in ( [ rhouu ] ) into @xmath19 in ( [ rhoud ] ) .",

    "as we stated in the introduction the problem of preparation of entangled states ( as quantum resources ) has been investigated . since there is growing evidence that separable states which have some degree of quantum correlation can be useful for quantum information and communication tasks @xcite , here we study the problem of preparation of separable quantum correlated states . in contrary with entanglement ,",
    "other quantum correlations can be generated by applying quantum channels that act _ only _ on one of the parties of the state @xcite .",

    "it is worthwhile to note that while some quantum correlated states can be produced by local operations , there are indeed some quantum states like @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( ( [ w ] ) and ( [ w ] ) ) which can not be created by local operations on any classical state .",
    "in fact there is a discrete correlation measure which can identify local producibility of quantum correlations , it is the rank @xmath81 of the correlation matrix of the state @xcite .",
    "@xmath81 is nothing but the number of orthogonal operators which is needed in the expansion of a density matrix .",
    "in fact rank can not be increased by local operations of one party alone @xcite .",
    "since all classically correlated states are of rank 2 , applying local operations on such states can produce only rank-2 quantum correlated states like @xmath82 @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it is certain that no rank-3 or rank-4 state can be produced by local operations of one of the parties on a classically correlated state @xcite and hence these states certainly have not locally producible quantum correlations . + it is also worthwhile to note that states with different correlation ranks act in a different manner in quantum information tasks and it seems that states of higher ranks , which can not be created locally , are more useful for such tasks .",

    "in fact , the difference of the states in @xmath32 and @xmath33 should be traced back to the requirement of setting up a standard and agreed - upon frame of coordinate axes between alice and bob .",
    "we will show that to enact the channel @xmath106 on the initial state ( [ rhoccuu ] ) and produce the state @xmath18 with a given fidelity , they need to align their coordinate axes with more precision compared with the case when they want to produce the state @xmath19 from ( [ rhoccud ] ) .",

    "it is this extra communication of bits which goes into the final higher value of quantum correlation for the states @xmath18 .",
    "note that in the present work , our method of comparison is not entirely quantitative in this respect , that is , while we prove the above statements quantitatively , we do not exactly relate the extra quantum correlation obtained to the extra classical correlation which is necessary for aligning the coordinate systems .",

    "+ first we should note that the two parties agree on the @xmath17 axis , since it is assumed that they both agree on the form of classically correlated states which has been given to them .",

    "note that the operator @xmath114 is applied only by alice .",
    "this is nothing but a @xmath115 rotation around any axis in the @xmath116 plane ( which is perpendicular to the @xmath17 axis and hence is known to both alice and bob ) .",
    "the difficulty arises when they want to enact in a correlated way the unitary operations @xmath117 or @xmath118 for which they have to agree on a fixed axis in the @xmath116 plane ( for example by using the method proposed in @xcite , or more generally by using the well know literature about the reference frames @xcite ) .",

    "to @xmath59 we obtain f_^u:=f(e(_cc^u),e_(_cc^u ) ) = + . in order to compare the fidelities , we simplify @xmath126 and after some rearrangements we find that :    ( f_^)^2-(f_^u)^2=(- ) , where @xmath127 has the same form as in ( [ def a ] ) except that @xmath128 and @xmath28 should be replaced with @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively .",
    "this clearly shows that @xmath131 as long as @xmath65 and they are equal only when @xmath37 . thus we see that the difference in fidelity is larger the more distant the states are from lower rank states , as measured by the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "+ briefly , in this section we have shown that for rank-4 states , it is always harder to prepare the state @xmath18 than the state @xmath19 , in the sense that alice and bob need to precisely agree on their corresponding coordinate axes , otherwise they end up with a state which has a lower fidelity with the required state . when @xmath37 , ( i.e. when the rank is less than 4 ) , the two fidelities are equal and at the same time the corresponding quantum correlations are also equal as they should be , since in this case the two states are convertible to each other via local unitary actions .",
    "one may wonder that the extra resource which is required for the preparation of @xmath18 is a consequence of our preparation method , in this section we show that even using an alternative method , one needs more initial resources to prepare @xmath18 compared with @xmath19 .",
    "up to now we have emphasized the absence of a universal not operator in our arguments ( see section ( [ preliminary ] ) and figure ( [ paralleantiparallel ] ) ) . as a matter of fact",
    "the universal not does not exist since it is not a completely positive map and it can be regarded as an anti - unitary operator .",
    "it is well known that although a universal not operator does not exist , there is an optimal not operation which can approximate it to any desired degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "therefore it is in order to re - evaluate our arguments in the light of this finding .",
    "this is what we do in this section .",
    "+ in @xcite it is shown that , although a universal not channel violates quantum mechanics and hence can not exist , one can achieve an optimal not which out of @xmath43 copies of a single pure qubit state , produces a qubit state which can be as orthogonal as we wish to the original state .",
    "there are two different scenarios to design the optimal not operator , the first method relies on optimal state estimation of the original state and then re - preparation of the orthogonal state whilst the second method would be to approximate an anti - unitary transformation on the hilbert space of the input qubit(s ) by a unitary transformation on a larger hilbert space which describes the input qubit(s ) and ancillas .",
    "the fidelity of the produced state with the actual orthogonal state is the same in both scenarios and is given by @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that regarding the second approach , an experimental realization of the optimal not has been carried out , where stimulated emission in parametric down conversion has been used @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "one qubit is encoded in a polarization state of a single photon which is injected as the input state into an optical parametric amplifier excited by a pulsed , mode - locked ultraviolet laser beam @xcite .",
    "+ the resulting process of optimal not operations can be described by the simple quantum channel @xcite [ opt - not ] ^n ( ^n)=^+ i , where @xmath46 is the state which is orthogonal to @xmath44 . + equipped with this new operation , one can now imagine an alternative method for production of @xmath18 states which at first sight may use less resources than the one mentioned above .",
    "for concreteness we restrict ourselves to the production of the state @xmath71 . in this alternative method ,",
    "one acts on the @xmath113 from the beginning and prepares @xmath72 without the need for much precise alignment between the axes , and then only at the end uses the optimal not operation ( by bob for example ) to turn @xmath72 to a state as close as possible to @xmath71 .",
    "this is shown in figure ( [ optimalnot ] ) along with the original method mentioned in section ( [ preparation ] ) .",
    "the price that one should pay is to use more copies of the initial states in order to achieve a given fidelity as per equation ( [ opt - not ] ) .",
    "in other words , in this new method one compromises the precision in @xmath119 ( the precision in alignment ) for the number of pairs of states to begin with . to make a comparison between the two methods , we assume that the axes have been aligned with a precision @xmath119 and then compare the fidelities of the two methods as follows .",
    "+ method a ) in this method , the channel @xmath123 is applied to the classical state @xmath132 and we calculate the fidelity of the resulting state with an ideal @xmath71 state , which turns out from ( [ fidelity ] ) to be :    [ fidmethod1 ] f_af(e_(_cc^ ) , w^(t))=.    method b ) in this method , the channel @xmath123 is applied to each of the n copies of the classical state @xmath113 and then the optimal not channel @xmath133 is applied to the resulting state to produce a state which is as close as possible to @xmath71 .",

    "the two fidelities are plotted in figure ( [ resource ] ) for @xmath4 which corresponds to the state @xmath135 .",
    "the results shown in this figure , confirm our earlier result that some sort of hidden classical correlation in the channel is responsible for the higher quantum correlation in the final state @xmath8 .",
    "this hidden classical correlation shows itself in method a as the need for more precise alignment of axes , and in method b as using a larger number of classically correlated states to begin with in order to achieve the final fidelity with the desired states . in both cases alice and bob",

    "the two methods give the same fidelity only when the number of copies in method b is infinite .",
    "second , to achieve a given fidelity , the two parties have two options : they can either align their axes with low precision ( high @xmath119 ) and then use a larger number of copies for the optimal not process , or else , they can use precisely aligned axes , in which case they need use a lower number of copies for the optimal not process .",

    "clearly this is only an example and does not exhausts all the communication tasks .",
    "as we mentioned before , separable states which have some degree of quantum correlation can be useful for quantum communication tasks like transmission of the information of the states , in which the rank of the correlation matrix determines the usefulness of the state @xcite .",
