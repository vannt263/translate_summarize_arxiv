    "one - particle inclusive production processes provide extensive tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) . in contrast to fully inclusive processes , it is possible to study distributions in the momentum of the final - state particle and to apply kinematical cuts close to the experimental situation . on the other hand ,",
    "contrary to even more exclusive cases , qcd factorisation theorems @xcite still hold stating that this class of observables can be computed as convolutions of _ universal _ parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) with perturbatively calculable hard scattering cross sections . as is well - known , it is due to the factorisation property that the parton model of qcd has predictive power",
    ". hence , tests of the universality of the pdfs and ffs are of crucial importance for validating this qcd framework . at the same time , lowest - order expressions for the hard scattering cross sections are often not sufficient for meaningful tests and the use of higher order computations is needed .    the perturbative analysis is becoming more involved and interesting if the observed final state hadron contains a heavy ( charm or bottom ) quark . in this case , the heavy - quark mass @xmath3 enters as an additional scale .",
    "clearly , the conventional massless formalism , also known as zero - mass variable - flavour - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) , can also be applied to this case , provided the hard scale @xmath4 of the process is much bigger than the heavy - quark mass so that terms @xmath5 are negligible . however ,",
    "at present collider energies , most of the experimental data lie in the kinematic region @xmath6 and it is necessary to take the power - like mass terms into account in a consistent framework .",
    "the conventional calculational scheme is the so - called massive scheme or fixed - flavour - number scheme ( ffns ) @xcite , in which the number of active flavours in the initial state is limited to @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in the case of massive charm ( bottom ) production , and the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) quark appears only in the final state . in this case , the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) quark is always treated as a heavy particle , not as a parton .",
    "the actual mass parameter @xmath3 is explicitly taken into account along with @xmath11 . in this scheme , @xmath3 acts as a cutoff for the initial- and final sate collinear singularities and sets the scale for the perturbative calculations . a factorisation of these would - be initial- and final state collinear singularities is not necessary , neither is the introduction of a ff for the transition @xmath12 .",
    "however at nlo , terms proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the strong coupling constant , arise from collinear gluon emissions by @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) quarks or from branchings of gluons into collinear @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) pairs .",
    "these terms are of order @xmath17(1 ) for large @xmath11 and spoil the convergence of the perturbation series .",
    "the ffns with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) should be limited to a rather limited range of @xmath11 , from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the advantage of this scheme , however , is that the @xmath20 power terms are fully taken into account .",
    "the zm - vfns and ffns are valid in complementary regions of @xmath11 , and it is desirable to combine them in a unified approach that incorporates the advantages of both schemes , i.e. to resum the large logarithms , retain the full finite-@xmath3 effects , and preserve the universality of the ffs . an earlier approach to implement such an interpolation is the so - called fixed - order - next - to - leading logarithm ( fonll ) scheme , in which the conventional cross section in the ffns is linearly combined wit a suitably modified cross section in the zm - vfns with perturbative ffs , using a @xmath11-dependent weight function @xcite . then the fonll cross section is convoluted with a non - pertubative ff for the @xmath12 transition .",
    "the subject of this review is the theoretical description of one - particle inclusive production of heavy - flavoured hadrons @xmath21 in a massive variable - flavour - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) .",
    "in such a scheme the large collinear logarithms of the heavy - quark mass @xmath22 are subtracted from the hard scattering cross sections and resummed through the evolution of the ffs and pdfs . at the same time , finite non - logarithmic mass terms @xmath5 are retained in the hard part and fully taken into account .    in order to test the pqcd formalism , in particular the universality of the ffs , it is important to provide a description of all relevant processes in a coherent framework .",
    "therefore , it is important to work out the gm - vfns at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of qcd for all the relevant processes .",
    "previously , the gm - vfns has been applied to the following processes : @xmath23 ( direct part ) @xcite , @xmath23 ( single resolved part ) @xcite , @xmath24 ( direct part ) @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite , where the latter results for hadron ",
    "hadron collisions also constitute the resolved contribution to the photoproduction process @xmath26 .    in this contribution",
    ", i will review the progress achieved in describing the production of heavy - flavoured hadrons @xmath27 in hadron ",
    "hadron and photon  proton collisions in the gm - vfn scheme as it has been worked out recently",
    ". the main focus will be on the comparison with experimental data from cdf at the tevatron for @xmath28 and @xmath29 and from h1 at hera for @xmath30 .",
    "the differential cross sections for inclusive heavy - flavoured hadron production can be computed in the gm - vfns according to the familiar factorisation formulae , however , with heavy - quark mass terms included in the hard scattering cross sections @xcite .",
    "generically , the physical cross sections are expressed as convolutions of pdfs for the incoming hadron(s ) , hard scattering cross sections , and ffs for the fragmentation of the outgoing partons into the observed hadron .",
    "all possible partonic subprocesses are taken into account .",
    "the massive hard scattering cross sections are constructed in a way that in the limit @xmath31 the conventional zm - vfns is recovered . a more detailed discussion of the gm - vfns and the construction of the massive hard scattering cross sections can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and the conference proceedings @xcite .",
    "a crucial ingredient entering these calculation are the non - perturbative ffs for the transition of the final state parton into the observed hadron @xmath27 . for charm - flavoured mesons , @xmath32 , such sets of ffs have been constructed quite some time ago . for @xmath33 , ffs were extracted at lo and nlo in the @xmath34 factorisation scheme with @xmath35 massless quark flavours @xcite from the scaled - energy ( @xmath36 ) distribution @xmath37 of the cross section of @xmath38 measured by the aleph @xcite and opal @xcite collaborations at cern lep1 .",
    "recently , this analysis was extended @xcite to include @xmath39 by exploiting appropriate opal data @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the starting scales @xmath40 for the dglap evolution of the @xmath41 ffs in the factorisation scale @xmath42 have been taken to be @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the ffs for @xmath47 were assumed to be zero at @xmath48 and were generated through the dglap evolution to larger values of @xmath42 . for consistency with the @xmath49 prescription for pdfs",
    ", we repeated the fits of the @xmath32 ffs for the choice @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     with the work in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was possible to include also the resolved part in the gm - vfns . this has been done and the predictions in the complete gm - vfns framework at nlo , combined with updated ffs @xcite , have been compared with recent h1 photoproduction data @xcite .",
    "the results of the calculation and the comparison with the data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] . in this figure",
    "also the predictions in the ffns based on the fmnr program @xcite are shown . the experimental cross section as a function of @xmath11 falls steeply with increasing @xmath11 as predicted by both calculations .",
    "fmnr predicts a distribution which decreases less steeply at large @xmath11 than the data as is seen more clearly from the plot of the ratio of the theoretical over the measured cross section .",
    "also in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] the differential cross section as a function of the pseudorapidity @xmath51 is shown .",
    "this cross section decreases with increasing @xmath52 .",
    "both calculations predict a similar shape and agree nicely with the data .",
    "the gm - vfns prediction shows a larger scale dependence .",
    "otherwise the two calculations give rather similar results , which is remarkable , considering the very different ingredients of the two approaches .",
    "we have discussed one - particle inclusive production of heavy - flavoured hadrons in hadron ",
    "hadron and photon  proton collisions in a massive variable - flavour - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) .",
    "the importance of a unified treatment of all these processes , based on qcd factorisation theorems , has been emphasised , in order to provide meaningful tests of the universality of the ffs and hence of qcd . at the same time",
    ", it is necessary to incorporate heavy - quark mass effects in the formalism since many of the present experimental data points lie in a kinematical region where the hard scale of the process is not much larger than the heavy - quark mass .",
    "this is achieved in the gm - vfns , which includes heavy - quark mass effects and still relies on qcd factorization .",
    "we have discussed numerical results for two reactions . in general ,",
    "the description of the transverse momentum spectra is quite good down to transverse momenta @xmath53 .",
    "extending the range of applicability of our scheme to smaller @xmath11 would require more work on the matching to the corresponding theories in the fixed flavor number scheme .",
