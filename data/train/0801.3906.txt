    "since their discovery in 1983  @xcite , @xmath8 and @xmath2 bosons have been studied at hadron colliders predominantly using their leptonic decays . in fact , the hadronic decays of these particles are generally so difficult to separate from the large background arising from generic jet pairs produced by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) interactions that , after the extraction of a mass bump in the dijet mass distribution by the ua2 collaboration from 630 gev data at the @xmath9 in 1987  @xcite , little more has emerged . at the fermilab tevatron",
    "the direct observation of hadronic decays of vector bosons is more difficult . with respect to the @xmath10 , the tevatron s higher center - of - mass energy is a disadvantage because , although the signal cross section is four times larger , the irreducible background from qcd processes yielding jet pairs increases by over an order of magnitude . during run i at the tevatron ( 1992 - 96 )",
    "hadronic @xmath8 decays were successfully used by the cdf and d  experiments in the discovery and measurement of the top quark both in the single lepton and fully hadronic final states .",
    "the larger run ii ( started in 2001 ) data sample made it possible to exploit the hadronic decay of @xmath8 bosons in top events for a direct calibration of the energy measurement of light - quark jets in the reconstruction of the @xmath11 decay .",
    "that technique provides a significant reduction of the systematic uncertainty arising from the jet energy measurement  @xcite .",
    "tevatron experiments can indeed reach an accuracy close to 1 gev/@xmath12 on the top quark mass in run ii by reducing to about 1% the uncertainty on the jet energy scale ( jes ) , a factor which measures the discrepancy between the effect of detector response and energy corrections in real and simulated hadronic jets .    for the @xmath2 boson , which is not produced in top decays ,",
    "the observation in hadronic final states is more complicated .",
    "only the decay to identified @xmath0-quark pairs is observable because the enormous @xmath13 background becomes significantly reduced .",
    "indeed , a small signal of @xmath14 decays was extracted by cdf in run i data exploiting the semileptonic decay of @xmath0 quarks by triggering on muons with low transverse momentum  @xcite .",
    "the signal was too small to extract information on the accuracy of the @xmath0-jet energy measurement , but it spurred the development of a dedicated trigger in run ii .",
    "a large signal of @xmath14 decays free from selection biases allows a precise measurement of the energy scale of @xmath0-quark jets and provides a determination of the @xmath0-jet energy resolution .",
    "the reduction of the uncertainty in the @xmath0-jet energy scale ( @xmath0-jes ) , that measures the ratio between the calorimeter response in real and simulated @xmath0-quark jets , can help all precision measurements of the top quark mass , while a determination of the @xmath0-jet energy resolution is important for the search for a low - mass higgs boson .",
    "the signal allows a direct tuning of algorithms that seek to increase the resolution of the @xmath0-jet energy measurement .",
    "these algorithms are a critical ingredient for the potential observation of the higgs boson at the tevatron if @xmath15 gev/@xmath12 .",
    "the largest contribution to the total uncertainty in the top quark mass determination at the tevatron originates from the knowledge of the jet energy scale .",
    "the jes can be determined from studies of detector response to single particles and a detailed modeling of their @xmath16 spectrum in jets  @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the accuracy of the resulting calibration can then be obtained with events containing a single photon recoiling against a hadronic jet , but the method is limited by systematic uncertainties arising from the modeling of the production process .",
    "a check of the light - quark calibration , which is essentially statistics - limited , comes instead from the measurement of @xmath17 decays in @xmath11 events , as mentioned earlier .",
    "when dealing with @xmath0-quark jets one has to cope with their unique fragmentation and decay properties , that result in uncertainties in the jets energy response .",
    "the @xmath1 hadron resulting from @xmath0-quark fragmentation carries a larger fraction of the parent quark momentum than hadrons originating from light quark fragmentation .",
    "uncertainties in the jet energy response arise from the imperfect knowledge of the fragmentation properties of @xmath0-quarks .",
    "moreover @xmath0-jets have a different response on average than light - quark and gluon jets because of the large semi - leptonic decay fraction of @xmath1 hadrons .",
    "the imperfect knowledge of the decay properties of @xmath0-quarks yield an additional uncertainty on the jet energy response .",
    "those effects have to be accurately modeled if one is to apply a generic jes factor , derived from light - quark and gluon jets , to the two @xmath0-jets emitted in @xmath11 decays . due to the small cross section of production processes yielding events with a high - energy photon recoiling against a @xmath0-quark jet , a measurement of the @xmath0-jes with transverse balancing techniques",
    "@xcite is quite difficult , and the tevatron experiments have so far been unable to exploit them . in this paper , however , we demonstrate the feasibility of extracting the @xmath0-jes from the reconstructed @xmath14 signal .",
    "we first discuss in detail the data sample we use and its collection and reconstruction ; then we describe the method by which we model the spectrum of the huge background from qcd events and our fitting technique .",
    "we then evaluate the systematic uncertainties affecting the signal extraction .",
    "finally , we present our measurement of the @xmath0-jes factor , which achieves an uncertainty better than @xmath5 using an integrated luminosity of @xmath3 of cdf run ii data , and we provide for the first time , as a cross check of our analysis , a measurement of the @xmath2 boson cross section from its @xmath18 final state .",
    "in this section we provide a short description of the experimental facility and discuss the method by which the sample of data used for our analysis is collected .",
    "we also describe the software reconstruction of the event characteristics that are most relevant to the measurement of @xmath2 boson decays to @xmath0-quark pairs .",
    "cdf is a magnetic spectrometer designed to detect and measure , over a wide range of rapidity , charged and neutral particles produced by 1.96 tev proton - antiproton collisions delivered by the tevatron collider .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite ; in this section we only describe those components most relevant to the @xmath14 measurement .",
    "a seven - layer silicon vertex detector ( svx ) is located immediately outside of the beam pipe .",
    "its microstrip sensors measure with a precision of about ten micrometers the position where charged particles cross each layer ; that information allows the discrimination of tracks originated from the decay of long - lived particles , as explained in section [ s : evtrec ] . outside the silicon detector , a large cylindrical multilayer drift chamber , the central outer tracker ( cot ) , measures track momenta within the pseudorapidity  @xcite interval @xmath19 from the curvature of their helices in the @xmath20 t axial magnetic field .",
    "electromagnetic and hadronic sampling calorimeters , arranged in a projective - tower geometry , surround the tracking systems and measure the energy and direction of electrons , photons , and jets in the range @xmath21 .",
    "muon systems outside the calorimeters allow the reconstruction of track segments for penetrating particles within @xmath22 . the beam luminosity is determined using gas cherenkov counters surrounding the beam pipe , which measure the average number of inelastic @xmath23 collisions per bunch crossing .",
    "data acquisition is initiated by a three - level trigger system  @xcite .",
    "level 1 and level 2 consist of dedicated hardware modules , while level 3 runs speed - optimized reconstruction algorithms on a farm of commercial processors . of particular relevance to our analysis",
    "are the hardware devices reconstructing charged particle tracks in the level 1 ( xft ) and level 2 ( svt ) trigger systems .",
    "xft  @xcite , the extremely fast tracker , uses hits in the cot and a fast hardware architecture to measure transverse momentum and azimuthal angle of charged tracks .",
    "svt  @xcite , the silicon vertex trigger , is a highly parallel system which allows the measurement of the impact parameter of tracks using svx information , with precision ( 35 @xmath24 m for 2 gev/@xmath25 tracks ) similar to that obtained offline .",
    "a trigger ( called z_bb ) , selecting events with low transverse energy jet pairs and containing tracks with significant impact parameter , was implemented in run ii as a mean of acquiring a large sample of @xmath2 decays to pairs of @xmath0-jets .",
    "the trigger design was based on the ability of the svt to identify and measure tracks with a significant value of @xmath26 , the impact parameter with respect to the beam position in the transverse plane .    during its operation , the trigger underwent a few small modifications to maintain a manageable trigger rate as the tevatron instantaneous luminosity increased . because even small trigger modifications may affect the shape of the background dijet mass distribution in a way which is very difficult to model with the necessary accuracy , this measurement focuses on approximately half of the total data collected in the years 2001 - 2006 , corresponding to a period of data taking when the trigger did not undergo significant changes .",
    "the version of the z_bb trigger that collected our data requires two xft tracks and a localized calorimeter energy deposit at level 1 , two low-@xmath27 calorimeter clusters  @xcite and two displaced svt tracks at level 2 , and two reconstructed jets and two large impact parameter tracks at level 3 .",
    "specifically , the following selection is applied to each event :    * level 1 requires one central ( @xmath28 ) calorimeter tower with transverse energy @xmath29 gev , plus two xft tracks with transverse momentum above 5.5 and 2.5 gev@xmath30 , respectively ; * level 2 vetoes events containing a calorimeter cluster of @xmath29 gev in the pseudorapidity range @xmath31 .",
    "events are required to have two central @xmath32 gev clusters plus two svt tracks with @xmath33 gev@xmath30 and impact parameter @xmath26 greater than 160 @xmath34 .",
    "* level 3 requires two central jets having @xmath35 gev . the event must also contain two tracks with @xmath33 gev@xmath30 and @xmath36 @xmath34 ; alternatively , track pairs with looser cuts ( @xmath37 gev@xmath30 , @xmath38 @xmath39 ) are accepted if the impact parameter is more than three times larger than its estimated measurement error .",
    "a dynamic prescaling was applied in the level 2 trigger during a portion of the period of activity of the above trigger .",
    "dynamic prescaling automatically rejects a variable fraction of the data passed by the trigger ; the fraction depends on the instantaneous luminosity of the colliding beams , and it is tuned to keep the output rate of the trigger system within the storage capabilities of the data acquisition system .",
    "the main effect of the prescaling factor is to reduce the effective integrated luminosity of the data ; for the z_bb trigger the maximum reduction is a factor of 10 at the highest luminosity . after a selection of runs tagged as `` good '' by the data quality monitor , the dataset contains a total of 39 million events .",
    "this corresponds to an integrated luminosity @xmath40 pb@xmath41 for the z_bb trigger and the run range considered in our analysis .",
    "the total uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is @xmath42 .",
    "version 6.216 of the pythia monte carlo ( mc ) program  @xcite was used to generate 7.4 million @xmath43 events with minimum - bias interactions superimposed according to the instantaneous luminosity of the real data .",
    "the @xmath2 boson sample was generated using cteq5l  @xcite parton density function ( pdf ) set .",
    "the pythia tune a parameter set  @xcite was used to model the underlying event .",
    "simulation of @xmath1 hadron decays was performed using the evtgen  @xcite event generator .",
    "event reconstruction was performed with the same offline algorithms used for real data .",
    "trigger requirements were emulated using trigger primitives simulation ( level 1 and level 2 ) and offline variables ( level 3 ) .",
    "in addition to the @xmath43 dataset , smaller samples of @xmath44 and @xmath45 were also generated and reconstructed with the same recipe outlined above , to study the contamination of such processes in our data sample ( see sec .  [",
    "s : rescont ] ) .",
    "moreover , several qcd pythia monte carlo samples were used for additional studies on sample composition and background modeling .",
    "finally , @xmath46 and @xmath47 mc samples , also generated with pythia , were used for studies of the systematic uncertainty on signal acceptance due to initial state qcd radiation .",
    "these studies are described in section [ s : effsig ] .",
    "hadronic jets are reconstructed from calorimeter tower information using an iterative jet cone clustering algorithm , jetclu  @xcite , with the cone radius @xmath48 units in the azimuth - pseudorapidity space .",
    "jet @xmath27 is computed by summing the energy deposited in calorimeter towers within the cone multiplied by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the polar angle of the @xmath27-weighted centroid of the clustered tower .",
    "the standard cdf jet energy correction package  @xcite determines the most probable energy of the parton that produced the jet by applying to the `` raw '' jet energy ( which is labeled level 0 ) several factors in series , to account for detector non - uniformities ( level 1 ) , multiple @xmath23 interactions ( level 4 ) , calorimeter stability and non - linear response , fragmentation model and monte carlo tuning ( level 5 ) and other effects such as energy from the underlying event included in the jet cone ( level 6 ) and energy lost out of the clustering cone ( level 7 ) .",
    "usually , cdf analyses seeking the reconstruction of massive object decays use jet energies corrected up to level 5 to reconstruct the kinematics of the final state , and apply separately custom corrections for those effects that are process - dependent ; that is the case , for instance , of top quark mass measurements .",
    "we made the same choice of correction level in our analysis in order to measure a @xmath0-jet energy scale factor that can be applied to other analyses based on high @xmath16 @xmath0-quark jets ( provided that they use the same @xmath51 jet cone definition ) .",
    "from now on , `` corrected '' jet energies will imply jet energies corrected to level 5 , while `` uncorrected '' jet energies will stand for raw ( level 0 ) measured jet energies .    for the purpose of maximizing the heavy flavor content in the dijet sample",
    ", we use the secvtx @xmath0-tagging algorithm to search for secondary vertices .",
    "indeed , the long lifetime and high mass of @xmath1 hadrons allow their decays to be well displaced from the primary @xmath52 interaction point , and thus form a secondary vertex .",
    "the algorithm is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . in short , secvtx searches for secondary vertices in jets with uncorrected @xmath53 gev and pseudorapidity in the range @xmath54 .",
    "the algorithm first selects charged tracks within the jet cone that have been measured in the silicon detector with sufficiently good position accuracy and that have a large significance of their impact parameter with respect to the interaction point .",
    "the algorithm then uses these tracks in a recursive procedure to reconstruct a common point of origin for at least three of them .",
    "if the reconstruction fails , tighter requirements are imposed on the tracks , and a fit accepting two - tracks vertices is attempted .",
    "reconstructed vertices are rejected if their transverse distance from the interaction point corresponds to the location of material of the innermost silicon layer ( 1.2 cm @xmath55 1.5 cm ) or if it is greater than 2.5 cm .",
    "if a good vertex is found , several quantities are computed with the tracks belonging to it . among them",
    ", we use the vertex mass ( see sec .  [",
    "s : sc ] ) , defined as the invariant mass of all tracks originating from the secondary vertex ; in the computation of the vertex mass , tracks are assumed to be charged pions ( @xmath56 mev/@xmath12 ) , there being no possible discrimination available between different particle species .    a jet is called _ taggable _ if it contains at least two tracks that pass all the selection criteria applied by the secvtx algorithm other than the large impact parameter requirement .",
    "a jet is said to be _",
    "@xmath0-tagged _ if a secondary vertex with good fit quality is found by the secvtx algorithm and if the angle between the jet direction and the vector pointing from primary vertex to the secondary vertex is less than @xmath57 .",
    "so - called _ negative tags _ are those failing the latter requirement : these are mostly light - quark or gluon jets with a fake secondary vertex due to imperfect track resolution . tagged jets constitute a subclass of taggable jets .",
    "secvtx has been demonstrated to efficiently tag @xmath0-quark jets ( 40 - 50% efficiency for @xmath0-jets from top quark decay ) , with light - quark and gluon fake rates of less than 1%  @xcite .",
    "for the extraction of a @xmath2 boson decay signal , whose cross section is smaller by more than three orders of magnitude than that of generic dijet background , it is mandatory to maximize the @xmath0-jet content of the data sample .",
    "consequently both jets are required to be tagged by secvtx . in the next section",
    "we show that this requirement is still needed for data collected with an impact parameter trigger .",
    "the trigger described in sec .",
    "[ s : trigger ] produces a dataset containing a significant fraction of events with two central @xmath0-quark jets .",
    "however , it is only through the direct reconstruction of the secondary vertex inside each of the two central jets that we can remove most of the light - quark and gluon background , because its production cross section is so large that it still dominates the data after trigger selection .",
    "we determine the fraction of events due to @xmath58 production using the vertex mass , which is sensitive to the flavor of the parton originating the jet : light quarks and gluons , which generate a secondary vertex tag only by virtue of track mismeasurement , produce vertices with low invariant mass on average ; charm and bottom quarks have vertices with larger mass , and the latter is easily distinguishable from the former ( see fig.[f : btagdistr ] ) .    for this study , the selection of clean dijet events",
    "was made tighter with respect to the initial data to ensure a better understanding of the event topology .",
    "events are selected if they contain two jets in the central calorimeter ( @xmath59 ) with uncorrected @xmath60 gev and if there are no jets with uncorrected @xmath35 gev in the @xmath61 calorimeter regions .",
    "the data are divided into subsets based on the trigger settings and running conditions in order to check for variations in the sample composition .",
    "the results show that the mean fraction of events due to direct production of a central @xmath58 pair in our data sample is @xmath62 in clean dijet events before secvtx tagging requirements ; @xmath63 in events with one jet containing a secvtx tag ; and @xmath64 in events with both jets secvtx tagged .",
    "these studies therefore indicate that in order to collect a sample with high @xmath65 purity it is necessary to require secondary vertex tagging of both central jets .    , @xmath25 , and light quark or gluon jets estimated from the sample composition fit .",

    "in this section we define the dijet system used for the reconstruction of the @xmath2 mass peak and the kinematic selection cuts we apply to increase the signal - to - background ratio .      as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : data ] , our initial dataset consists of events that pass a level 2 trigger requirement of two central calorimeter clusters with a very low @xmath27 threshold , which was set at 3 gev to affect as little as possible the shape of the turn - on in the dijet mass distribution . the low threshold is needed because the @xmath27 of soft jets is measured rather poorly by the level 2 trigger hardware cluster finder  @xcite . in the level 3 trigger ,",
    "jets are required to have @xmath35 gev using the standard cdf jet cone algorithm .",
    "the dijet mass turn - on is significantly affected by this requirement because the jet energies are still uncorrected .",
    "however this requirement is mandatory to keep the trigger rate at an acceptable level .",
    "we must carefully model the effect of the trigger selection on the mass distribution .",
    "this is made easier if the region of maximum variation in the jet reconstruction efficiency , the turn - on region , is discarded by means of a sharp offline cut .",
    "we studied the raw and corrected @xmath27 distributions of the two leading jets in our data in order to select an initial threshold to define our dijet sample .",

    "the selection of @xmath2 bosons that decay to @xmath0-quark jets and their discrimination from the huge qcd background is a difficult experimental problem .",
    "background events differ only slightly from the signal : they feature a higher probability of gluon radiation from the initial state , a different color configuration of the final state , and of course a non - resonant structure in the invariant mass .",
    "we studied many kinematic variables which could in principle be sensitive to these differences .",
    "however , very little can be done after selecting a clean dijet system in which both jets are @xmath0-tagged .",
    "the most sensitive quantities providing additional discrimination are the transverse energy of the third jet , @xmath69 , and the angle between the leading two jets in the plane transverse to the beam , @xmath70 .",

    "[ f : kinvars]_,width=283 ]    to determine the best cuts on these two variables we employ pseudo - experiments , which allow us to estimate the @xmath0-jet energy scale uncertainty we would obtain from a fit to the dijet mass distribution with the number of events and signal fraction expected for a given set of kinematic cuts ( @xmath71 , where @xmath72 varies from 2.0 to 3.1 radians and @xmath73 varies from 1 to 25 gev ) .",
    "we construct pseudo - data distributions of the dijet invariant mass from a data - driven background template ( see sec .",
    "[ s : bgr_sig_templ ] ) and a @xmath14 mc signal template corresponding to a @xmath0-jet energy scale @xmath74 .",
    "for each pseudo - experiment , we perform a simple two - components @xmath75 fit .",
    "we use as a background template in the fit the same distribution used to generate the background mass values in the pseudo - data distribution , while for the signal we use in turn 21 different templates generated at varying values of the @xmath0-jet energy scale @xmath76 from 0.9 to 1.1 .",
    "the width of the resulting @xmath75 curve gives us the accuracy of the fit .",
    "to first order , the minimum uncertainty in the @xmath0-jet energy scale among a set of fits with varying data statistics and signal to noise ( @xmath77 ) values should correspond to the largest value of @xmath78 .",

    "a priori studies of the accuracy of our background modeling performed on background - enriched data events where only one jet is @xmath0-tagged ( very low signal fraction : @xmath79 ) allow us to predict a shape uncertainty of @xmath80 . for these pseudo - experiments , therefore , we include the effect of a background uncertainty in the fits by adding in quadrature an uncertainty equal to @xmath80 of the bin content to the uncertainty of each bin in the pseudo - data distribution .",
    "the effect of an inflation by @xmath80 in the statistical error is not exactly the same as a systematic uncertainty in the knowledge of the background shape , but it is a good first - order guess of the impact that a similar uncertainty has on a fit to the dijet mass distribution with a given signal fraction .",

    "we also evaluate in this section the contributions from different sources of contamination to our sample .",
    "finally we discuss the impact of our modeling of initial state radiation on signal acceptance uncertainty .",
    "monte carlo events of @xmath14 signal were required to pass the z_bb trigger simulation and the same offline cuts applied to the experimental data . multiplying the signal efficiency obtained from mc to the cross section for @xmath2 boson production times the branching ratio of @xmath2 decay to @xmath0-quark pairs  @xcite and to the total integrated luminosity of the data , we obtain a raw estimate of 9478 events with two secvtx taggable jets passing the kinematic selection , 4164 of them with both jets @xmath0-tagged .",
    "the modeling of @xmath0-quark tagging in the monte carlo simulations depends on subtle characteristics : physics effects such as the admixture of @xmath1 mesons and baryons produced in the fragmentation , their lifetimes , and their momentum spectra ; and detector modeling issues such as the detailed description of track position measurements in the silicon microstrip detector and track - finding efficiency inside jets . for these reasons , cdf measures a @xmath0-tagging scale factor , defined as the ratio of secvtx vertex - finding efficiency on @xmath0-quark jets in the data to that in monte carlo simulated @xmath0-jets .",

    "the effect of all main sources of systematic uncertainties affecting the measured cross section is summarized in table [ t : systxsec ] .",
    "below we discuss each contribution separately .",
    "the systematic error on total signal efficiency , @xmath188 , due to standard cdf jet energy corrections , is estimated from @xmath189 mc where the energy of measured jets is shifted by @xmath190 of the standard jet energy correction . the relative error on the signal efficiency is then calculated as @xmath191 and amounts to @xmath192 .",
    "the effect of increased or decreased final state radiation ( fsr ) on signal efficiency is evaluated using @xmath43 mc samples generated with different fsr tunings . the relative uncertainty on efficiency due to this source is found to be @xmath193 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty related to initial state radiation was derived from @xmath194 data / mc comparison ( where @xmath195 is an electron or a muon , see sec .",
    "[ s : sysuncisr ] ) and yields an additional @xmath112 contribution to the total error . the relative error on signal efficiency due to different parton distribution function parameterizations ( see sec .  [",
    "s : systbjes_other ] ) is estimated to be @xmath196 .",
    "an additional source of systematic error is related to the mc generator dependence .",
    "we evaluate it by comparing pythia and herwig  @xcite @xmath43 samples . the resulting uncertainty on signal efficiency is found to be @xmath197 .",
    "to be conservative we take the error on this measured value as our systematic .    the systematic affecting the trigger efficiency measurement",
    "was also estimated ( see sec .  [",
    "s : nsig ] ) and found to be @xmath198 .",
    "several sources of systematic uncertainty related to the data - driven background modeling and the fitting procedure were taken into account .",
    "the first one derives from the finite statistics in the templates used in the background model construction , and was estimated performing pseudo - experiments in a similar way as in sec .",
    "[ s : systbjes_bg ] . the mean uncertainty on the number of fitted signal events is @xmath199 . a second systematic uncertainty is related to the sideband criteria we applied to select the `` best '' background model used to perform the cross section measurement . as in sec .",
    "[ s : systbjes_bg ] we create a histogram of the fitted number of events of signal obtained with each different background shapes using the @xmath152-value of their respective sideband fits as a weight .",
    "this fitting procedure , performed with the iterative method described previously , yields an uncertainty on the number of fitted @xmath14 events of @xmath200 .",
    "we also estimated the effect on the number of fitted signal events due to the constraint of the background shape to the dijet mass spectrum sideband .",
    "in fact an additional systematical error can arise from the uncertainty on the background normalization or from the small leakage of the signal in the sideband .",
    "we evaluate this uncertainty performing pseudo - experiments where the background normalization is shifted by @xmath201 ( @xmath202 is the statistical uncertainty on the background normalization ) .",
    "the mean relative error on the fitted number of events of signal is measured to be @xmath203 .",
    "finally , a systematic due to the iterative background correction procedure is estimated .",
    "the iterative method relies on the extrapolation of the number of events of signal in the background templates , given a fitted number of events of signal in the data .",
    "these background correction functions are estimated from monte carlo and yield a statistical uncertainty .",
    "the systematic error due to this source is estimated from fits to the data performed with smeared correction functions . the mean uncertainty on the number of signal events is estimated to be @xmath204 .",
    "two additional sources of systematic uncertainty must be accounted for , the @xmath0-jet tagging data / mc scale factor uncertainty ( @xmath205 ) and the error on the integrated luminosity measurement ( @xmath42 ) .      using the integrated luminosity , trigger and kinematic efficiencies , and",
    "related systematic uncertainties described above , we derive : @xmath206    the measured cross section is higher but consistent within the uncertainties with the nlo theoretical calculation  @xcite combined with the measured @xmath207 branching ratio  @xcite , which predicts @xmath208 pb .    while this measurement has no appreciable impact on our knowledge of the production and decay mechanism of the @xmath2 boson in hadronic collisions , it does fill a gap in the picture of measurements of standard model production processes of vector bosons .",
    "if future searches for new physics especially the higgs boson and supersymmetric particles at the tevatron and at the lhc prove successful , final states with @xmath0-quark jets will be very important to study and measure .",
    "the current measurement and the described methodology provide a normalization point for the measurement of the production rate of new @xmath209 resonances , or for setting a limit on their cross section .",
    "we have shown in this paper how a sizable sample of @xmath2 boson decays to @xmath0-quark pairs has been extracted from proton - antiproton collisions provided by the tevatron collider .",
    "we have also described in detail the method we used to obtain a precise measurement of the @xmath0-jet energy scale from the shape of the dijet mass distribution of the selected data .",
    "the measurement can be used to reduce the dominant systematic uncertainty in many of the cdf analyses which determine the top quark mass , provided that they use a similar jet definition to ours .",
    "the precise knowledge of the @xmath0-jet energy scale is of benefit also to analyses attempting to reconstruct new resonances with decay to @xmath0-quark jets , such as a low - mass standard model higgs boson .",
    "the signal has also been used to measure the cross section for @xmath2 boson production using the @xmath6 final state : the result is @xmath210 pb .",
