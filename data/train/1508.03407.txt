    "collective behavior , which occurs commonly in physical , chemical and biological systems , has been a subject of continued interest in nonlinear science over the last decades @xcite . in neural and biological systems , a typical collective behavior observed is the coherent motion of oscillators .",
    "this phenomenon of synchronization has been widely regarded as having important implications to the function and performance of those systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , asynchronous contraction of the heart the may be triggered by electrical spiral waves , which eventually leads to heart dysfunction @xcite .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid to a particular hybrid state in which an ensemble of identical oscillators with identical coupling spontaneously degenerate to one group with synchronization ( coherent ) and the other group with desynchronization ( incoherent ) @xcite .",
    "this fascinating counterintuitive state was first discovered by kuramoto and co - workers @xcite , and named  chimera state \" by strogatz @xcite .",
    "the experimental confirmation of the existence of chimera states has been reported independently almost at the same time in diverse systems such as coupled maps @xcite , chemical oscillators @xcite and mechanical pendulums @xcite . in two - dimensional systems , chimera states",
    "take the form of spiral waves @xcite , called spiral wave chimeras with phase - locking oscillators in the spiral arm but a phase - randomized spiral core @xcite . an analytical solution for a spiral wave chimera",
    "was further demonstrated by strogatz _",
    "et al_. using a kuramoto - type phase equation with nonlocal coupling @xcite .",
    "recently , the spiral wave chimera state has been reported experimentally in chemical oscillators @xcite and numerically in complex and even chaotic oscillators @xcite where nonlocal coupling is introduced .",
    "it was initially believed that the chimera state arises from so - called nonlocal coupling , i.e. each oscillator in the system will be affected _ instantaneously _ by a group of oscillators within certain interacted range .",
    "therefore , nonlocal coupling is intermediate between the cases of local and global coupling .",
    "however , some recent works show that the non - locality conditions for occurrence of the chimera state can be further relaxed @xcite . for example , sethia _",
    "et al_. have demonstrated a generalized chimera state called `` amplitude mediated chimera state '' in a population of oscillators even in the case of global coupling rather than the nonlocal coupling @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out , on one hand , that in the seminal work of kuramoto _",
    "et al_. , a key assumption to observe spiral wave chimeras is that the third component of reaction - diffusion ( rd ) changes so fast that it can be eliminated adiabatically @xcite . in this way",
    ", the three - component rd system is essentially reduced to an effective two - component one with an extra term represented by a nonlocal coupling . on the other hand , to observe chimera state in experiments , the realization of nonlocal coupling strongly relies on a computer @xcite .",
    "therefore , it remains an open question whether spiral wave chimeras exist in more natural systems .",
    "in such systems , the time scale of each component in the system may be comparable and the coupling will be mediated by a natural law such as diffusion .",
    "further more , spiral waves can rotate outwardly or inwardly @xcite , however all the spiral wave chimeras reported previously are outward .",
    "there is very little information on the existence of inwardly rotating spiral wave chimera .    in this work ,",
    "we report the first numerical evidence of the existence of spiral wave chimeras in three - component rd system where each oscillatory element is locally coupled by diffusion , i.e. , by nearest neighbor interaction . differing from previously observed spiral wave chimeras in nonlocally coupled systems",
    ", our study shows remarkable novel properties of spiral wave chimeras : first the observed spiral wave chimeras rotate inwardly , i.e. , a coherent wave propagates toward the phase - randomized center .",
    "second , the non - diffusing components in the rd system exhibit chimera properties , while the diffusing components show a coherent spiral structure . a continuous transition from spiral wave with a smooth core to spiral wave chimeras",
    "is also identified .",
    "our findings in rd systems show that the occurrence of the chimera states does not require nonlocal or global coupling and therefore provide key hints to explore the chimera state in the natural world .",
    "_ model description . _",

    "this three - component rd system actually is an extension of the two - component fitzhugh - nagumo model by coupling to a third variable @xmath3 , which was proposed to study pattern formation in the belousov - zhabotinsky ( bz ) reaction dispersed in water droplets of a water - in - oil aerosol ot ( aot ) microemulsion system ( bz - aot system ) @xcite and to model spot dynamics in gas discharges @xcite .",
    "this study will differ from previous work on pattern formation in rd systems in two aspects .",
    "the first modification is related to the ratio of the diffusion coefficients @xmath14 .",

    "our second modification is to omit the key assumption that the third variable @xmath3 changes fast , i.e. , @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "in this study , we have found states in locally coupled rd systems that are highly similar to the chimera states found in non - locally coupled oscillator systems @xcite .",

    "our results are not limited to the particular rd system , when it is are linearly coupled to the a third variable that diffuses . since",
    "no parameter tuning was involved in our numerical experiments , we believe that the robust nature of spiral wave chimeras found in locally coupled systems indicates that spiral wave chimeras may be a frequent self - organized spatiotemporal pattern in complex systems , which may arise from weak coupling of a set of oscillators by a diffusing variable . therefore , we expect that natural chimera states will be found in oscillatory biological or chemical systems .",
    "previous works on chimera states were focused on nonlocal or global coupling . in both cases ,",
    "each element in the system was treated as a discrete oscillator . whether chimera states exist in a spatially extended continuous media",
    "remains an open question . in a recent note @xcite ,",
    "one - dimensional chimera states in networks of pure local coupling were recently reported . however",
    ", this author did not consider spiral chimera states .    in our work",
    ", we started from the spatial discretization of a laplacian operator in eq . on a cartesian grid , and found that the resulting wave became incoherent at the level of the grid scale .",
    "furthermore , we have verified that using a finer discretization , the chimera state still persists .",
    "thus , in locally coupled systems , the elusive chimera state breaks the continuum representation of the medium and forces one to consider the domain as a set of individual oscillators .",
    "therefore , future analytical approaches will need to match the continuum dynamics in the outer region with discrete non - linear dynamics in the spiral core region .",
    "it is noted that although we take the form of local coupling between the @xmath3 variable , in the limit case of @xmath17 , such kind of local coupling of the inhibitor @xmath3 may give rise to the nonlocal effect due to the in absence of diffusion of activator @xmath1 .",
    "however , these nonlocal effects , which largely differs from the traditional nonlocal coupling ( where each oscillator in the system will be affected _ instantaneously _ by a group of oscillators within certain interacted range ) , are not only spatial but also temporal , because of the finite @xmath6 .",
    "the systems with the local coupling that nevertheless demonstrate spatiotemporally nonlocal effects have been largely overlooked in the last decades .",
    "however , such systems may be very common in biological systems and thus deserve further investigation in the future",
    ".     there may be various reasons for not observing chimeras in natural experimental settings before . from our study",
    "we note two necessary conditions : first , the local dynamics of each element needs to be oscillatory .",
    "secondly , one requires close - to - vanishing spatial coupling of the observed variable .",
    "finally , we note the essential property of the system ( 1 ) used in our study is that each oscillator ( described by @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) is coupled indirectly via a nonuniform dynamical environment which described by the variable @xmath3 .",
    "the systems with such property may denote a broad class of the systems such as chemical oscillators e.g. , bz - aot @xcite and bz particles imersed in the solutions @xcite , engineered gene network @xcite , yeast cells @xcite . from the results in this study , we expect that natural chimera states can be found in many oscillatory biological or chemical systems .",
    "in summary , we have shown that ( inward ) spiral wave chimeras do exist in spatially extended oscillatory media where only nearest - nearest interaction between the element is present . in such system ,",
    "the nondiffusing components appear as a spiral wave chimera , while the diffusing variables show a coherent spiral wave structure .    a continuous transition from coherent spiral waves to spiral waves chimeras",
    "is observed as we increase the model parameter @xmath8 that controls the hopf bifurcation . a phase diagram for spiral wave chimeras",
    "is identified in the wide parameter space .",
    "we further discussed the smooth effects on the spiral core by the diffusion of the activator @xmath1 .",
    "our results on the spiral wave chimera in locally coupled oscillator systems largely improves our understanding of the chimera state and provides indications that the chimera state can be found in natural systems such as biological and chemical systems where each oscillating element communicates via a diffusive dynamical environment ."
