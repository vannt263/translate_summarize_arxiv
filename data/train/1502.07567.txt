    "authentication codes ( macs ) are cryptographic primitives used extensively in the construction of security services , include authentication , nonrepudiation , and integrity . basically , message authentication is to ensure that an accepted message truly comes from its acclaimed transmitter . when the transmitter intends to send a message , it also generates a mac , which is a function of the message and a shared key , known only to both the transmitter and the receiver . the generated mac is often appended to the message @xcite . at the receiver ,",
    "a mac is computed from the received message and compared to the mac that is transmitted . if the two macs are identical , then the transmitter is identified as a legal user and it is highly likely the received message is exactly equal to the one transmitted .",
    "mac algorithms can be constructed from other cryptographic primitives , such as cryptographic hash functions or from block cipher algorithms .",
    "currently , the security of mac algorithms rely on the hardness of hush functions , i.e , given the message and its mac , it is  hard \" to forge a mac on a new message .    as the development of mobile communications , ensuring security of wireless communications has becoming increasingly important .",
    "openness of wireless networks makes them vulnerable to spoofing attacks where an unauthorized user masquerades as another legitimate user . although conventional cryptographic security mechanisms can be used to foil such attacks above the physical layer @xcite .",
    "however , it was believed that more efforts should be done to prevent potential innovative attacks since the wireless medium offers novel avenues for intrusion . in recent years",
    ", there has been various efforts @xcite in authenticating the sender and receiver at the physical layer , based on prior coordination or secret sharing , where the sender is authenticated if the receiver can successfully demodulate and decode the transmission . among various reported works ,",
    "it was commonly observed that the physical properties of the wireless medium are a powerful source of domain - specific information that can be used to complement and enhance traditional security mechanisms@xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "a physical - layer authentication scheme was proposed , in which macs , along with messages , are transmitted concurrently over the physical layer . compared to the traditional transmission approach above the physical layer ,",
    "the authors claims the possibility of information - security due to the introduction of the noise .",
    "however , this is not justified in a rigourous way .    in this paper , we provide a channel coding approach for physical - layer authentication .",
    "our contributions include two aspects .",
    "firstly , the computational security can be expressed as the requirement for decoding complexity .",
    "secondly , the information security can be formulated for physical - layer authentication schemes using the standard techniques for a converse proof of channel coding theorem @xcite .    throughout this paper ,",
    "upper case letters ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) will denote random variables , lower case letters ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) will denote realizations of the corresponding random variables . and calligraphic letters ( e.g. , @xmath2 ) will denote finite alphabet sets over which corresponding variables range . also , upper case boldface letters ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) will denote random vectors whereas lower case boldface letters ( e.g. , @xmath4 ) will denote realizations of the corresponding random vectors .",
    "suppose that alice and bob agree on a keyed authentication scheme that allows bob to verify that the messages he receives are from alice . in order to authenticate",
    ", alice sends an authentication tag ( or a mac ) , along with a message , for declaring his identity .",
    "we call the transmitted signal under this scheme as the tagged signal .    formally ,",
    "alice , as the sender , wants to transmit the authentication tag @xmath5 together with the message @xmath6 so bob ( as the receiver ) can verify her identity .",
    "in general , the tag is a function of the message @xmath6 and the secret key @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a ( hash ) function .    in order to focus on the essential ideas , we assume here that both the message @xmath6 and tag @xmath5 can be denoted as binary random vectors with bpsk modulation . in what follows",
    ", we do not discriminate between binary and bipolar vectors , as it can be well understood from the text .    often , the tag is a short string computed on the message @xmath6 to be authenticated and the shared secret key @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the length of the message @xmath6 , the key @xmath7 and the tag @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "in practice , @xmath11 . here , we always assume that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a large integer .",
    "the tag is padded to the message and simultaneously transmitted .",
    "the tagged signal ( in a discrete column vector form ) can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is a modulation process for modulating a binary tag string @xmath18 into the physical discrete - signal vector @xmath19 , which is chosen to meet @xmath20=0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "hence , we can interpret @xmath21 and @xmath22 as energy allocations of the message and tag , respectively .",
    "essentially , for concurrent transmission of both message and tag , the bit string of a tag should be transmitted with a much lower rate ( @xmath23 ) than the message symbol rate . in @xcite ,",
    "the haar wavelet is employed for modulating tags . in this paper , we , however , assume a simple repetition function of @xmath24 , namely , each component of @xmath18 is repeated @xmath13 times , which means that @xmath25^t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is employed for ease of analysis .    by assuming an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel model , the received signal vector at bob can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is assumed to an awgn vector .",
    "as @xmath28 and the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is sufficiently high , the transmitted message is assumed to be completely recoverable ( often enhanced by error - correcting codes ) for both bob and eve .",
    "therefore , one can assume that the transmitted signal vector @xmath29 is known to both bob and eve .",
    "when @xmath29 is available at the receiver , it can cancel the message from the received signal samples and the message - free version of a tag can be retrieved @xcite , which takes the form of @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the zero - mean additive white gaussian noise vector with variance @xmath33=\\delta_{ij } \\gamma_t^{-1 } i_{l_t}$ ] and @xmath34 denotes the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) observed by the authentication tags .",
    "given a message @xmath35 , it is possible to generate a code @xmath36 , which comprised of @xmath37 codewords , namely , @xmath38 where each codeword @xmath39 is indexed by a possible key @xmath40 with @xmath41 denoting the decimal number expression of the binary vector @xmath42 .",
    "there are @xmath43 codewords .",
    "now , the code rate of @xmath36 can be defined as @xmath44    consider that alice wants to authenticate with bob , she normally sends a message @xmath29 , and then a tag @xmath39 is generated using the shared key @xmath42 .",
    "equivalently , the generation of the tag for a given message @xmath29 can be considered as an encoding process of @xmath45 as the message @xmath29 is generated according to a finite message set @xmath46 , one have to consider an ensemble of codes @xmath47 , which is of fixed rate @xmath48 .",
    "this ensemble of codes @xmath49 is revealed to both alice and bob . from a standard cryptographic view , this code ensemble is also revealed to eve .    the minimum hamming distance of the code ensemble @xmath49 can be defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the hamming distance of two binary vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "now , the task of physical - layer authentication can be formally formulated as a hypothesis testing problem as follows .",
    "bob decides if @xmath54 is from alice or not by assuming that + @xmath55 are available ; 2 .",
    "eve tries to retrieve @xmath42 from @xmath54 by assuming that + @xmath56 are available .",
    "to complete the authentication process , bob requires to verify that whether the response signal @xmath54 is from alice or not .",
    "if the response signal is not from alice but eve ( an impersonation attacker ) , it is assumed that eve generates length-@xmath57 binary random vector @xmath58 for authentication as there is no any information about @xmath59 available .",
    "essentially , this is cast as a binary hypothesis testing problem : @xmath60 where @xmath7 denotes the acknowledged key .",
    "hypothesis testing is the task of deciding which of two hypotheses , @xmath61 or @xmath62 , is true , when one is given the value @xmath63 of a random variable @xmath64 ( e.g. , the outcome of a measurement ) , namely , @xmath65 . in our case , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "we begin with the formulation of the optimum binary hypothesis testing , i.e. , @xmath68 we point out that in the case of @xmath61 , the generation of the message and key is independent to each other as there is no means to efficiently gauss the key .    as the message @xmath29 is assumed to be available , it is clear that @xmath69\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath70 .    in general , this binary hypothesis testing problem in its optimum form can not be easily tackled as it requires to enumerate @xmath71 binary vectors of @xmath42 with a priori uniform distribution .",
    "however , its performance can be information - theoretically bounded @xcite , which is summarized as follows .",
    "let @xmath72 be the detection probability , namely , the probability of successful declaration of @xmath62 when @xmath62 is actually true , and @xmath73 be the false alarm probability , namely , the probability of false declaration of @xmath62 when @xmath61 is actually true .",
    "let the function @xmath74 be defined by @xmath75    with optimal hypothesis testing ( [ eq : opmhyp ] ) , its detection probability and false alarm probability are closely connected .",
    "@xcite the detection probability @xmath76 and the false alarm probability @xmath77 satisfy @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the mutual information between two random variables @xmath80 and @xmath7 , and @xmath81 for two probability distributions @xmath82 .",
    "as the optimum hypothesis testing is difficult to implement , we propose to use a simple test statistic @xmath83 and @xmath84 is further compared to a threshold value @xmath85 for making a final decision , where @xmath86 is the codeword due to the input of @xmath87 at bob .",
    "this approach can be viewed as a code acquisition approach encountered in code - division multiple - access ( cdma ) communication systems , where @xmath88 can be considered as a unique pn code , which is available at the sides of both alice and bob , but keeps unknown to any potential attacker .    in both hypotheses",
    ", @xmath89 is the sum of @xmath90 normally distributed random variables , which is still normally distributed .",
    "therefore , it suffices to compute its mean and variance .    in the case of hypothesis @xmath62",
    ", one can show that @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "we denote its mean and variance as @xmath93    by decomposing the hypothesis @xmath61 into a series of sub - hypothesises @xmath94 , i.e. , by further assuming that the transmitted signal is @xmath29 and eve impersonates alice using the key @xmath58 , we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "then , @xmath97 it is clear that @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the authentication is typically claimed if @xmath100 .",
    "the threshold @xmath85 of this test is determined for a false alarm probability @xmath77 according to the distribution of @xmath101 @xmath102 \\ge   \\beta,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103    the detection probability can be simply computed as @xmath104",
    "for a physical - layer authentication system , we can characterize it using a quadruple @xmath105 . in this paper",
    ", we always assume a memory - less channel and hence , @xmath106 .",
    "eve , as the adversary , is an aware receiver and knows the authentication scheme that alice and bob are using .",
    "however , she does not know the shared secret key between alice and bob",
    ". she can be a passive attacker or active attacker . as an active attacker",
    ", eve can perform impersonation attacks .      as a passive attacker ,",
    "eve only monitors all frames inside the network during authentication , and tries to learn @xmath87 from whatever it gets .",
    "firstly , we consider the noiseless setting as in a classic authentication application above the physical layer , in which eve can directly acquire the signal @xmath29 and the tag @xmath107 .",
    "given @xmath29 and if the encoding rule @xmath108 is a bijection , eve can recover the key @xmath42 by generating a lookup table of size @xmath37 and searching over this table for finding the key @xmath58 , which admits @xmath109 .    in the language of coding , it means that the recovery of key can be considered as decoding of the received signal @xmath80 to its maximum possible encoding input @xmath110 .",
    "given @xmath29 , if any decoder @xmath110 is of computational complexity @xmath111 , we claim that the computational security can be achieved for this authentication system .",
    "( computational security ) given a physical - layer authentication system @xmath105 , we claim that this system is computationally secure if for any decoder @xmath110 , its computation complexity is of @xmath111 .       for ensuring computational security",
    ", it requires that no any efficient decoding algorithm exists for any code @xmath112 . since the publication of shannon s original paper in 1948",
    ", the search of the codes for achieving the channel capacity has come a long way .",
    "currently , linear codes and their efficient decoding algorithms have been extensively studied .",
    "therefore , for construction of a good physical layer authentication system , linear code ensembles should be better avoided as their complexity can often be reduced due to the linearity of codes .    in the classic authentication scenarios ,",
    "eve can observe several pairs of ( message , tag ) , namely , @xmath113 . for computational security",
    ", it means that eve is still hopeless for getting an estimate of @xmath42 with many observation pairs @xmath114 . in the language of coding ,",
    "this can be well justified as each pair @xmath114 reflects an codeword of @xmath115 . if @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 reveal the structure of two different codes , i.e. , @xmath115 and @xmath119 .",
    "secondly , we consider the noise setting , as seen in the physical - layer authentication scenarios .",
    "let the binary codeword @xmath120 , which is further modulated with @xmath121 and transmitted over the channel @xmath122 , the received vector @xmath123 . a maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding algorithm decodes the vector @xmath54 into a codeword @xmath124 , such that @xmath125    ( ml recoverable ) given @xmath123 and @xmath29 , where @xmath126 . for an ml decoder @xmath127 ,",
    "we mean that @xmath128 if @xmath129 , we claim that the authentication key is ml recoverable .       in what follows",
    ", we consider a binary - input continuous - output awgn channel ( bi - awgn ) .",
    "its capacity @xmath130 is a function of the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath34 , which can be explicitly expressed as @xmath131,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 .",
    "the sp59 bound of shannon @xcite provides a lower bound on the decoding error probability of block codes transmitted over the awgn channel . with a coding approach for physical - layer authentication , the best possible decoding probability with ml decoding for a potential eavesdropper",
    "can now be lower bounded with the shannon s 1959 sphere - packing bound .",
    "( the 1959 sphere - packing lower bound @xcite ) for a physical - layer authentication system , characterized by the quadruple @xmath105 .",
    "let a message @xmath133 be sent , and the authentication tags are assumed to be transmited over a bi - awgn channel with the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath34 .",
    "for any decoder @xmath134 , it is clear that @xmath135 form a markov process .",
    "let @xmath136 , we have that @xmath137 where @xmath138 @xmath139 and @xmath140 $ ] satisfies the inequality @xmath141 with @xmath142       the sp59 bound is exponentially increased with the block length and the exponent is strictly negative for all @xmath143 , it become clear that above capacity the minimum probability of error goes to 1 exponentially fast with the block length .",
    "hence , one can achieve the information security for physical - layer authentication , which , however , not the case for classic authentication .",
    "( information security ) given a physical - layer authentication system @xmath144 over an awgn channel of the snr @xmath34 , we claim that this system can achieve information security if @xmath145 when @xmath146 .",
    "numerically , we ll show that the decoding error probability can go to 1 even with short block length if the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath34 is sufficiently low .",
    "in a so - called impersonation attack at time @xmath147 , the adversary ( eve ) waits until he has seen the ciphertexts @xmath148 ( which he lets pass unchanged to the receiver ) and then creates and sends a fraudulent ciphertext @xmath149 which he hopes to be accepted by the receiver as the @xmath147th ciphertext .",
    "essentially , eve s strategy is to maximize the false acceptance rate by selecting a suitable message @xmath150 and a key @xmath58 , namely , @xmath151 equivalently , this means @xmath152 as shown by ( [ eq : etah1 ] ) .",
    "in order to minimize the false acceptance rate of an impersonate attacker , the minimum hamming distance of the code ensemble @xmath49 , namely , @xmath153 , should be maximized .",
    "consider a physical - layer authentication system , in which binary key is of length @xmath154 and the authentication tag is of length @xmath155 .",
    "to attack this physical - layer authentication system , a potential eavesdropper tries to do her or his best to decode the key . as one can consider the block codes of rate @xmath48 over a bi - awgn channel of the snr @xmath34",

    "[ fig : spb ] shows the sp59 bound on the decoding error probability and detection probability ( successful authentication rate ) for different @xmath156 s .",
    "as the eavesdropper can not do better than a ml decoder , the spb bound provides an over - estimate of its capability on guessing the key .",
    "as shown , the eavesdropper becomes hopeless in guessing the key whenever @xmath156 is below to about -1 db as the decoding error probability is around 1 .",
    "however , the authentication system does work well with almost perfect successful authentication rate . in simulations ,",
    "the threshold is set so as the false alarm probability is lower than 0.01 .",
    "we propose a channel coding approach for physical layer authentication . with this new approach , the computational security for classic authentication schemes can be well formulated using a new decoding approach .",
    "the well - designed physical - layer authentication can ensure a new degree of security , namely , information - security , thanks to the introduction of channel noises during transmission .    for design of a physical layer authentication system",
    ", the success authentication rate should be balanced with an acceptable false acceptance rate .",
    "it is beneficial for use of long tags , as the success authentication rate can be enhanced while the false acceptance rate can be reduced . in the meantime ,",
    "numerical results show that even with short tags ( of length 256 ) , the best possible decoding error probability under ml decoding can approach 1 while the authentication still work well .",
