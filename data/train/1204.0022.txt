    "in a previous paper @xcite , the spectral density associated to a scalar field assuming event horizon fluctuations was presented . in particular , it was considered a two - level uniform accelerated system interacting with a massless scalar field .",
    "assuming the two - level system prepared in the ground state and the field in the minkowski vacuum state , the main result of the paper was to show how the transition rates are modified by event horizon fluctuations .",
    "for modeling the event horizon fluctuation it was assumed that the scalar field satisfies a massless klein - gordon equation with random coefficient .",
    "it was found a modified response function with the same local temperature found in the non - fluctuating case .",
    "the correction due to the event horizon fluctuations has a fermi - dirac factor .",
    "a similar result found previously by takagi @xcite in a quite different situation . for a careful discussion for the apparent inversion of statistics",
    "see for example the ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main motivations for such kind of studies follows the ideas present in ref . @xcite . in this work",
    "it was proposed in condensed matter physics an analog model for quantum gravity effects which in turn is based on results obtained by ford and collaborators @xcite and hu and shiokawa @xcite .",
    "two general features of waves propagating in random fluids were considered .",
    "first , acoustic perturbation in a fluid define discontinuity surfaces that provide a causal structure with sound cones .",
    "second , propagation of acoustic excitations in random media are generally described by wave equations with random speed of sound @xcite . a quantum scalar field theory associated to acoustic waves",
    "was analyzed in a situation where the velocity of propagation of the acoustic wave and consequently the sound cone fluctuates . in this approach a stochastic ensemble of fluctuating geometries was assumed .    in this paper",
    "we follow the ideas present in ref .",
    "basically we study how a particular model for the fluctuations of a black - hole event horizon can affect the transition rate of a two - level system @xcite .",
    "let us consider the line element of a four - dimensional schwarzschild space - time describing a non - rotating uncharged black - hole of mass @xmath0 :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the metric of a unit @xmath3-sphere .",

    "we can summarize our approach saying that one model to take into account the effects of black hole event horizons fluctuations is the following : we assume that event horizon fluctuations are modeled basically by a centered , stationary and gaussian random processes .",
    "under these conditions , we obtain a random differential equation for the dirac field that can not be solve exactly . therefore , we implement a perturbation theory , similar to the one developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in our case associated to a massless dirac field .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ section2 ] we discuss the perturbation theory for the fermionic field in a disordered medium . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we present the modified positive wightman function due to the fluctuating horizon . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we study the modifications to transition probabilities of a unruh - dewitt detector due the event horizon fluctuations .",
    "finally , section [ section5 ] contains our conclusions . to simplify the calculations we assume the units to be such that @xmath13 .",
    "we begin by writing a random dirac equation    @xmath14\\psi(t , { \\bf x } ) = 0.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath15 represents a fermionic field , @xmath16 are the dirac matrices and @xmath17 is a dimensionless random function of the spatial coordinates .",

    "we also suppose that the noise is gaussian distributed .",
    "these last statements are pragmatic one .",
    "this is one of the simplest models one can choose which can exhibit light cone fluctuations .",
    "we will also see in next sections that this choice implies in a loss of stationarity in the wightman function to the rindler noise and the wiener - khintchine theorem is no longer valid @xcite .    to proceed ,",
    "let us define the fourier transforms to the dirac field and also to the noise :    @xmath22    @xmath23    similar to ref .",
    "@xcite we can split eq . in a free and perturbed part @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are matrices in the coordinates or momentum spaces .",

    "it assumes the form given by :    @xmath42    where    @xmath43    in the above equation the self - energy @xmath44 is given by    @xmath45    only the first part of the integral in eq .",

    "we are now able to apply this result to the calculation of the response function of the unruh - dewitt detector .",
    "this will be done in next sections .",
    "before consider the unruh - dewitt detector we need to understand how the wightman function and the rindler noise changes if we take into account event horizons fluctuations .",
    "first , it is known that for an uniformly accelerated reference frame with proper acceleration @xmath55 , rindler s coordinates are the appropriate coordinates to be used .",

    "we define a proper spinor in the following form    @xmath58    where the corresponding matrix @xmath59 takes care of the fermi - walker transport . here",
    "the observer is , by definition , a rindler observer , in a given time @xmath57 related to the laboratory frame we define the boosts @xmath60 , which the non - vanishing components are given by    @xmath61    so the corresponding matrix of the transformation of the spinor is given by    @xmath62    the wightman function will be also fermi - walker transported due its definition in terms of the dirac field .",
    "the  proper \" wightman function in the accelerated reference frame is called the rindler noise for the dirac field and it is defined by :    @xmath63    changing the variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 the total green function is given by    @xmath66    the rindler noise associated to the free case ( non - random dirac equations ) is given by    @xmath67\\frac{s_{-\\eta}\\sinh(\\frac{\\alpha\\xi}{2})}{\\sinh^4(\\frac{\\alpha\\xi}{2}-i\\epsilon)},\\ ] ]    which is the result already known in literature .",
    "using eqs . ,",
    "and we find that the rindler noise , taking into account fluctuations of the event horizon is given by :    @xmath68    where some terms were absorbed by the @xmath69 factor .",
    "the strength noises were rewritten by @xmath70 and @xmath71 which are positive functions and grow with @xmath72 , while the functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 are given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fghj ] ) and ( [ eq : fghj3 ] ) in [ apendiceb ] .",
    "this result shows how the fluctuating event horizon modifies the rindler noise associated to the dirac field . in the next section",
    "we will apply these results and the results found in previous section to find the response function associated to the unruh - dewitt detector .",
    "in this section we use our results obtained with the dirac field to study the response and transition probabilities associated with the unruh - dewitt detector @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume an uniform accelerated detector coupled to a massless dirac field @xmath75 with the following interacting hamiltonian    @xmath76    in the eq .",

    "we consider the detector as a point - like object with a two energy levels structure given by @xmath81 and eigenstates @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gap energy between both states would be @xmath84 . defining the initial state of the system at @xmath85 as @xmath86 and a final state at time @xmath57 by @xmath87 we can apply perturbation theory to compute the probability of transition of the unruh - dewitt detector .",

    "now we will only concentrate in the response function which is given by    @xmath92    then , in this case we have to calculate a four - point correlation function .",
    "due to the gaussian nature of the noise this four - point correlation function can be compute in terms of a product of two - point correlation functions . in this case , one can find @xcite :    @xmath93 , \\label{eq : eqtrace}\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 is the trace and @xmath95 is the positive frequency wightman function .",
    "introducing again the variables @xmath96 and @xmath97 the response function may be written as @xcite    @xmath98 .",
    "\\label{eq : response - function2}\\ ] ]    after averaging over the fluctuations , we can introduce eq . into eq . to get the one - loop correction to the response function .",
    "hence , we expand the squared wightman function in eq . resulting in four contributions to the response function , where omitting the arguments of the wightman functions it can be expressed by :    @xmath99    substituting the eq .",
    "( [ eq : trace - exp ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : response - function2 ] ) we can write @xmath100 , where    @xmath101    and    @xmath102    in the asymptotic limit the first term @xmath103 gives the known thermal contribution . we show only the result because it can be calculated following the same steps done for the correction which we will show later .",
    "the main aspect is that in the free case ( non - random dirac equation ) the probability of excitation , i.e. , @xmath104 ( modulo the selectivity ) of the unruh - dewitt detector presents a bose - einstein factor @xcite .",
    "we get @xmath105 where    @xmath106    note that the second and third terms in eq .",

    "( [ freecase ] ) and ( [ eq : correction_s ] ) , and the last term is of the order @xmath108 .",

    "the integration over @xmath72 it s easier to be done using algebraic computational programs .",
    "let us write these integrations in terms of two functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "now we can obtain the expression :    @xmath115    to perform these integrals it is convenient to replace @xmath116 and express each integral as    @xmath117 ,   \\label{eq : finite - int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath118 are the terms in the curly brackets from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lead2-correction ] ) . replacing @xmath119 in the first integral into squared brackets",
    ", we can simplify all brackets to a single integral given by :    @xmath120    the nature of this term is associated with the switching on and off of the interaction between the detector and the background field .",
    "it can be neglected if we assume large proper time intervals . however , for short proper times intervals it must be taken into account .",

    "however , note that we have odd order poles .",
    "in fact , these integrals will be associated with a nine order residue of @xmath123 at @xmath124 .",
    "so , performing such integral the correction to the response function for the unruh - dewitt detector is :    @xmath125    where    @xmath126    and now @xmath127 , when @xmath128 .",
    "we note that the correction to the response function shows a fermi - dirac factor instead of a bose - einstein factor found in the free case .",
    "if a temperature could be defined here , it would be given by @xmath129 .",
    "however there is some remarks to discussed here .",
    "remember that in the minkowski reference frame the noise function @xmath17 depends only on the spatial coordinates , while in the rindler system the noise function depends on the proper time @xmath57 , in other words the noise is a function of @xmath130 and @xmath72 , and now we have a non - equilibrium behavior of the field measured by the detector . in this case",
    "we can define a local temperature , see refs . @xcite and @xcite , which depends on the proper time by the function @xmath131 .",
    "it was showed that the temperature which appears in the response function correction is an averaged temperature over the fluctuations and the global temperature is related with the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the last result shows that the lack of stationarity in the accelerated frame does not necessarily implies that a thermal - like response function with local temperature is forbidden . with such above considerations a possible interpretation of our result is that light - cone fluctuations in this model lead to the emergence of a local temperature as seen by accelerated observers .",
    "so far we have evaluated the horizon fluctuating contribution to the response function for an unruh - dewitt detector coupled to a massless fermionic field . instead using a detector like that one considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , it is also possible to use another kind of detectors .",
    "it is known that the interaction hamiltonian for the scalar field coupled with the unruh - dewitt detector is a monopole - moment @xcite . in other words , it is a two level system operator coupled with a scalar field , hence it is linear in the field .",
    "it gives a response function which depends on the two point instead of the four point green function found to the fermionic field case .",
    "thus , instead of hamiltonian given by eq .",

    "( [ eq : fw - fields])-([eq : fw - fields3 ] ) .",

    "as we discussed , it is also possible to define a local temperature , @xmath129 , in this non - equilibrium situation and , in a similar way , the effective noise strength is proportional to the proper time .",

    "first , we developed a perturbation theory associated to a massless fermionic field in the presence of random noise .",
    "after performing the calculations we have applied these results to investigate the thermal radiation near a fluctuating horizon .",
    "we showed that horizon fluctuation implies that the unruh - dewitt detector which has a bose - einstein factor in the response function associated with the free case has now a correction which has fermi - dirac factor .",
    "we would like to stress that we are assuming that it is possible to define a local temperature in this non - equilibrium situation . in a less realistic detector ,",
    "coupled linearly with a dirac field , the correction has also an apparent change in the distribution measured by in the response function with unchanged temperature . in this situation the leading term ( case without fluctuations ) has a fermi - dirac factor and in the correction appears a bose - einstein factor .",
    "since the de sitter horizon has also a thermal spectrum measured by the unruh - dewitt detector @xcite for both , bosons and fermions , a natural extension of our work is to study the effects of a fluctuating de sitter horizon to such kind of coupling .",
    "it is also natural to enquire the effects of introducing a time dependent randomness @xcite in place of the eqs .",
