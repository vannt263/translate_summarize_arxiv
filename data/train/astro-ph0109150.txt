    "most of our knowledge of the global structure of the galaxy relies on the comparison of magnitude and colour star counts in different galactic directions .",
    "star counts alone do not allow us to solve the dilemma that a star of a given apparent magnitude can be either intrinsically faint and close by , or bright and distant .",
    "this problem may be addressed statistically by using the century - old equation of stellar statistics ( von seeliger 1898 ) :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the number of stars which have an apparent magnitude in the range @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 is the luminosity function , which depends on the intrinsic magnitude , @xmath5 , and the colour band @xmath6 , while @xmath7 is the density at radius @xmath8 ( within @xmath9 ) along the line of sight in the direction given by the galactic longitudes and latitudes @xmath10 ( within the solid angle @xmath11 ) .",
    "this equation can not be solved or inverted ( i.e. by determining both the stellar lf and the density law ) except for a few simplified cases .",
    "for instance , with a `` homogeneous '' stellar sample for which the absolute magnitudes of stars or more precisely their luminosity functions are known , the density law along the line of sight can be recovered . a classical numerical technique ( mihalas & binney 1981 ) has been proposed  the bok diagram ( 1937 )  while more rigorous treatments are required for small samples to stabilize the inversion so as to produce smooth solutions ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) . the converse situation is the determination of the luminosity function assuming a known density law ( see , for instance , recent studies of the faint end of the disk or halo main sequence based on deep star counts ( reid et al .",
    "1996 , gould et al .",
    "1998 ) .    a simple approach , developed largely in the eighties , was to integrate assuming some prior information concerning the stellar populations ( see , for instance , pritchet 1983 , bahcall et al . , 1983 , buser 1985 , robin & crz 1986 ) .",
    "a frequent assumption is , for instance , to assume that the halo stars have the same luminosity function as some low metallicity globular clusters .",
    "another approach consists in building a stellar luminosity function from stellar evolution tracks and isochrones of various ages .",
    "this has been used to put constraints on the galactic disk star formation rate ( haywood et al 1997ab ) .",
    "stronger a priori constraints may also be derived by requiring dynamical consistency , since the vertical kinematics of stars is related to the flattening of stellar disks or spheroidal components .",
    "since star counts alone , @xmath12 , are not sufficient to constrain uniquely galactic stellar population models , it is expected that two ( or more ) distinct models will reproduce the same apparent star counts . however , this is not a real worry , since it is likely that adding some relevant extra a priori information must help to lift partially the degeneracy of the models .    in this paper",
    ", it is shown that the degeneracy is lifted altogether when we consider , in addition to the star counts in apparent magnitude , the proper motions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for a relatively general dynamically consistent model ( stationary , axisymmetric and fixed kinematic radial gradients ) , the statistical equation counts may be formally inverted , giving access to _ both _ the vertical density law of each stellar population _ and _ their luminosity functions .",
    "this is developed in section  [ s : deriv ] where we show how the vertical motions are related to the thickness of stellar components .",
    "the remaining degeneracy occurs only for a quadratic vertical potential .",
    "otherwise  when the vertical component of the potential is known  the departures from quadratic behaviour define a characteristic scale that allows us to transform statistically the magnitudes into distances and proper motions into velocities .",
    "similarly , the asymmetric drift and/or the vertical velocity component of the sun provide a natural scale in energy , leading to the same inversion procedure .    for ideal star counts ( infinitely deep and for an infinite number of stars )",
    ", the inversion gives exactly the proportion of stars in each kinematic component , providing a direct diagnostic to split the thin disk from the thick disk or the halo , and its luminosity function @xmath4 is recovered for each kinematic stellar component .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the supplementary constraints introduced by the requirement for dynamical consistency .",
    "section  [ s : deriv ] presents the generalized stellar statistic equation which accounts for proper motions , and demonstrates the uniqueness of the inversion for two families of plane parallel distribution functions : the singular velocity ellipsoid ( subsection  [ s : toy ] ) and a constant ratio velocity ellipsoid ( subsection  [ s : sch ] ) while subsection  [ s : epi ] presents a basic description of the epicyclic model .",
    "section  [ s : simul ] illustrates the inversion procedure on a fictitious superposition of 4 kinematically decoupled populations with distinct main sequence turn - off magnitudes for the constant ratio velocity ellipsoid and the epicyclic models .",
    "the next section discusses the effects of truncation in apparent magnitude ( i.e. completude of the catalog ) in the recovered lf as well as noise in the measurements .",

    "note that , conversely , the agreement between the standard direct method to predict the local luminosity function and the method presented here could be used to measure the galactic potential .",

    "we intend in a forthcoming paper to apply the method presented here to the tycho-2 catalogue ( hg et al . , 1998 ) and to other proper motion catalogues in order to determine the luminosity function of stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we will investigate the limitations introduced by a magnitude - limited catalogue , by the finite size of catalogues and also by our limited knowledge of the galactic potential .",

    "e.g. _ will simply be modified accordingly . alternatively , multicolour photometry could be sufficient to constrain the spatial extinction law .",
    "of course the dimensionality of the problem is increased by the number of different colour bands used , since the analysis must be carried while accounting for all colours simultaneously .",
    "the final error on the recovered luminosity functions will depend on the photometric errors of the observational catalogue(@xmath254 0.1 for the tycho-2 catalogue down to 0.013 for @xmath255 , @xmath256 for photographic surveys ) .",
    "it will also depend on the relative proper motion accuracy ( @xmath257 , with @xmath258 the typical dispersion for a stellar group at a given distances ) . with the tycho-2 catalogue completed by proper motions ( with an accuracy of 2.5 mas / y ) , and for disk giants with velocity dispersions from 10 to 50 km / s and proper motion dispersions from 2 to 10 mas / y",
    ", the accuracy on the recovered luminosity function will be limited to about 0.5 magnitude .",

    "it will remain that farther out , only proper motions and photometry will have sufficient accuracy and generalization of methods such as that derived here will be used to extrapolate our knowledge of the kinematic and luminosity function of the galaxy and its satellites . for instance appendix  [ s : external ] sketches the possible inversion of an external globular cluster luminosity function with gaia quality photometry .",

    "<S> a method for inverting the statistical star counts equation , including proper motions , is presented ; in order to break the degeneracy in that equation it uses the supplementary constraints required by dynamical consistency . </S>",
