    "the following effective lagrangian for gluon field and its motivation were discussed in  @xcite : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is a scale of qcd related to gluon condensate , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 the minima of the effective potential are achieved for covariantly constant abelian ( anti-)self - dual fields @xmath4 where the matrix @xmath5 belongs to the cartan subalgebra of @xmath6 @xmath7 the minima are connected by discrete parity and weyl transformations , which indicates that the system is prone to existence of solitons in real space - time and kink configurations in euclidean space .",
    "group - theoretical analysis of symmetry breaking and domain wall formation was done in  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the simplest kink configuration ",
    "kink interpolating between self - dual and anti - self - dual abelian vacua .",
    "if the angle @xmath8 between chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields is allowed to deviate from the constant vacuum value and all other parameters are fixed to the vacuum values , then the lagrangian reads @xmath9 the corresponding equation of motion is sine - gordon equation @xmath10 which have the following kink solution : @xmath11 the angle @xmath8 interpolates between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 stays for one of the four euclidean coordinates .",
    "the kink describes a planar domain wall between the regions with almost homogeneous abelian self - dual and anti - self - dual gluon fields .",
    "chromomagnetic and chromoelectric fields are orthogonal to each other on the wall . far away from the wall the field is self - dual or anti - self - dual , and absolute value of the topological charge density",
    "is equal to the value of the gluon condensate .",
    "the topological charge density vanishes on the wall .",
    "we may now construct kink superposition with the standard methods .",
    "let us denote the general kink configuration as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the inverse width of the kink , @xmath17 is a normal vector to the plane of the wall .",
    "the general kink network is then given by @xmath18    now we consider more general kink - like solution : three parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 deviate from their vacuum values near the center of the kink ( fig .  [ 3-kink ] ) .",
    "one may see that the value of scalar condensate @xmath21 decreases in the center of the kink which may increase size of stable chromomagnetic flux tube .",
    "calculation of one - loop quark contribution to the qcd effective potential demonstrated that strong electromagnetic fields can play the role of a trigger for deconfinement  @xcite .",
    "the catalyzing role of strong magnetic fields was also observed in lattice qcd simulations  @xcite . during heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the electric @xmath22 and magnetic @xmath23 fields are almost orthogonal to each other  @xcite : @xmath24 . for this configuration of the external electromagnetic field ,",
    "the one - loop quark contribution to the qcd effective potential for the homogeneous abelian gluon fields is minimal for the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields directed along the electric and magnetic fields respectively  @xcite .",
    "the orthogonal chromo - fields are not confining : color charged quasiparticles can move along the chromomagnetic field .",
    "deconfined quarks as well as gluons can move preferably along the direction of the magnetic field even after the electromagnetic field turns off .",
    "this means that a defect in domain wall network may be formed during heavy ion collision ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chromo_bag ] ) .",
    "let us consider eigenvalue problem for vector field @xmath25q_\\nu=\\lambda^2 q_\\mu\\ ] ] with the boundary conditions @xmath26 the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath27 in the finite trap the lowest eigenvalue is @xmath28 few lowest eigenvalues @xmath29 as functions of @xmath30 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen_flow ] .",
    "one concludes that if the dimensionless size @xmath30 of the trap is sufficiently small @xmath31 then there are no unstable tachyonic modes in the spectrum of color charged vector fields .    to estimate the critical size",
    "one may use the mean phenomenological value of the gluon condensate ( gauge coupling constant @xmath32 is included into the field strength tensor ) @xmath33 equation   leads to the critical radius @xmath34 however , as it follows from fig .  [ 3-kink ] , scalar condensate become smaller at the domain wall and may increase the value of critical radius .",
    "[ fig : eigen_flow ]    in minkowski space - time the eigenvalue problem turns to the wave equation : @xmath35q_\\nu=0.\\ ] ] solution for this equation can be found as a linear combination of eigenmodes   with @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37    equation can be treated as the dispersion relation between energy @xmath38 and momentum @xmath39 for the quasiparticles . unlike the chromomagnetic field ,",
    "the ( anti-)self - dual fields characteristic for the bulk of domain network configuration lead to purely discrete spectrum of eigenmodes in euclidean space and do not possess any quasiparticle treatment in terms of dispersion relation between energy and momentum for elementary color charged excitations .",
    "even though a single chromomagnetic trap has critical size , overall volume of deconfinement transition in hadronic matter is not restricted by @xmath40 .",
    "numerous traps may be formed , for instance , due to the influence of strong electromagnetic fields in the whole region of relativistic heavy ion collision  @xcite .",
    "the traps may merge into a large chromomagnetic lump developing the flux tube structure inside the lump .",
    "equivalently , one may also think about formation of the flux tubes inside the traps with overcritical size emerging under conditions of high energy or / and baryon number density , strong electromagnetic fields .    in the absence of any external impact one",
    "expects that the fraction of the deconfinement phase is statistically negligible as it occupies an essentially three - dimensional sub - manifold in the four - dimensional space @xmath41 .",
    "the influence of external conditions like the high energy density , high baryon density and strong electromagnetic fields can trigger the growth of the relative fraction of the deconfined phase . under certain conditions",
    "high energy density accumulated by colorless collective excitations can be converted into the thermodynamics of color charged quasiparticles .",
    "the growth of the deconfinement phase fraction may be described in terms of creation of either numerous stable chromomagnetic traps or / and the trap with overcritical size , populated by the polarized chromomagnetic tubes  @xcite .    in the confinement regime ( color charge quasiparticles",
    "are completely suppressed ) one may expect @xmath42 while the deconfinement regime ( color charged quasiparticles are fully activated ) occurs if @xmath43    the scalar gluon condensate may stay practically unchanged during the phase transformation .",
    "the regime of dilute plasma can not be reached unless the scalar gluon condensate density vanishes , which would require complete rearrangement of the quantum effective action . however , as soon as the color charged quasiparticles are activated the structure of the effective action itself in principle becomes dependent on their temperature and density , and it can not be excluded that the scalar condensate vanishes at certain critical values of the temperature and density .    in summary ,",
    "the domain wall network representation of qcd vacuum is suggestive of a two - stage deconfinement transition . at the first stage",
    "topological charge density vanishes , but the scalar condensate stays almost unchanged , color charged quasiparticles are activated at this stage while the colorless collective excitations can decay into the color charged ones .",
    "the system is far from being a dilute gas . at the second stage",
    "the scalar gluon condensate vanishes , and the system turns into dilute quark - gluon plasma ."
