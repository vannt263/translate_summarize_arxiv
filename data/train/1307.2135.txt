    "in recent years , strong experimental evidence has emerged that the plastic response of materials is not smooth and continuous  as would be expected from classical stress - strain relationships  but instead intrinsically subject to fluctuations @xcite , both temporally and spatially .",
    "for example , upon application of external stress , plastic strain in micron sized samples increases in avalanches with power law distributions  @xcite .",
    "such avalanches are also present in bulk materials , as shown by acoustic emission measurements  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , acoustic emission localization @xcite and surface observations @xcite reveal complex spatial patterns .    in crystalline materials ,",
    "the observed intermittent behavior is related to the dynamics of interacting dislocations @xcite , and it is believed that because interactions between dislocations are long - ranged , the scaling of this intermittent behavior is of a mean - field nature @xcite . at the same time , experiments @xcite and molecular dynamics simulations @xcite show that scale free avalanches and complex strain patterns are also shared by amorphous materials where localized defects are not present .",
    "an open question that remains is whether the universality class of amorphous plasticity is the same as that of crystalline plasticity .    in two dimensions ,",
    "amorphous plasticity can be captured by a simple model @xcite with two competing ingredients : ( i ) disorder in the form of randomly distributed local yield thresholds , and ( ii ) a long - range , anisotropic interaction kernel , which in an infinite system is given by the eshelby form @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the build up of plastic strain can be mapped on to the motion of a 2d interface in the transverse direction , driven by external stress .",
    "the random yield thresholds represent a landscape of random energy barriers through which the interface moves , so that the model can be thought of as a type of @xmath1 dimensional depinning model that undergoes a transition from the pinned phase to the moving phase as external stress is increased @xcite .",
    "in fact , a formally similar model was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite as a mesoscale model for crystal plasticity .",
    "the similarity derives from the fact that in two dimensions the stress created by moving a dislocation in a crystal is equivalent to the one produced by a localized shear event in an amorphous material .",
    "therefore we could expect that crystal and amorphous plasticity share the same critical behavior , at least in two dimensions , where mean field behavior has been observed @xcite .",
    "this is , however , contradicted by recent results by talamali _",
    "et al _  @xcite suggesting that at criticality , the amorphous plasticity model is not mean - field , as evidenced by , e.g , avalanche size distributions .    to shed some light on the universality class of amorphous plasticity , we present large - scale simulation studies of plasticity in 2d amorphous materials .",
    "previous studies of this system have suffered from small system sizes , a consequence of the large computational cost induced by the long - range interactions . by implementing our simulations on the parallel architecture of a graphics processing unit ,",
    "we are able to access larger system sizes than those previously published , enabling a clearer picture to be built up of the critical behaviour of the model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we examine the strain avalanches of the system away from criticality , and find that  depending on the short - range part of the interaction kernel  the model can exhibit a nonuniversal crossover from mean - field behavior at small stresses to non mean - field behavior , similar to that observed in a lattice model for ductile fracture  @xcite .",
    "we then examine the non mean - field behavior at criticality in greater depth , and present evidence that it is indeed universal , depending only on the large - scale nature of interactions .",
    "the onset of non mean - field behavior is connected to strain localization , which we find is affected by small changes to short - range interactions .",
    "this is especially apparent when weakening is introduced to the model .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional square lattice , in which each lattice site represents an area element small enough that the strain is uniform within it . unless otherwise stated , all results presented here are for systems of size @xmath2 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is a matter of some subtlety , because it is essential to ensure that the mean of the interaction kernel is zero over the whole system , to avoid imposing an extraneous net stress . here",
    ", we consider two periodization methods , which are distinguished by their short - range behaviors . as discussed below , the nonuniversal effects caused by these differences can be considerable .    in the first method , an infinite set of images of the system in the @xmath3 direction",
    "are summed over analytically , and then a finite number of exponentially - decaying terms arising from images in the @xmath4 direction are summed numerically , as described in appendix  [ imagesum ] .",
    "we refer to this periodized kernel as the `` image sum kernel '' .",
    "we emphasize that the summation is a purely formal procedure for obtaining an interaction kernel that is periodic with the same short - range behaviour as the kernel in the infinite system , since the sum over images is in fact only conditionally convergent  @xcite .",
    "this method conserves the @xmath5 nature of the original ( infinite system ) kernel at small distances , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kernels ] .",
    "the second method of periodization , which has been studied previously  @xcite , is to fourier transform the kernel analytically in the infinite system , and then discretize this on an @xmath6 lattice in fourier space , setting the @xmath7 term ( that is , the mean of the kernel in real space ) to zero . transforming back to real space using a discrete fourier transform ensures periodization .",
    "we refer to this kernel as the `` fourier kernel '' .",
    "we emphasize that this method of periodization , like the image summation method , introduces discretization effects , because high - frequency modes are cut off .",
    "a side - effect of this is to modify the short - range part of the interaction away from a @xmath5 form , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kernels ] .",
    "however , both kernels are nearly identical at large distances , following @xmath5 except near the system edges where periodization imposes a distortion ; and both kernels are also stable , with all fourier modes non - positive .",

    "the two methods of periodization give almost identical results , except for short - range interactions .",
    "the red lines indicate a @xmath5 decay . ]",
    "the system is initialized with strain @xmath11 at all sites , and stress thresholds @xmath12 taken from a uniform distribution over @xmath13 .",
    "the external stress @xmath14 is increased adiabatically , and in each `` time step '' all sites that reach their threshold are updated simultaneously , by increasing their strain by a fixed amount @xmath15 and taking a new yield threshold .",
    "unless otherwise stated , yield thresholds are always chosen from the same distribution , that is , there is no hardening or softening .",
    "an advantage of this method of driving is that avalanches are well defined .",
    "the size of an avalanche is the total strain increase that occurs before the external stress is increased again , and the duration is the number of time steps taken . the simulation is stopped when the system reaches a mean strain of @xmath16 , which is large enough to avoid spurious size effects  @xcite ( the numerical value of @xmath16 is typically @xmath17@xmath18 ) .",

    "the avalanche size distributions are measured for stress bins ( of width @xmath20 ) and are shown in fig .",

    "the distributions can be fit using a function based on that given by le doussal and wiese  @xcite for a one - loop correction to mean - field theory depinning : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are fitting parameters that absorb the normalization , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are related to @xmath22 via the parameter @xmath31 : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is euler s constant .",

    "[ fit_small_stress ] .",
    "the variation in fitted @xmath22 is not , in itself , proof of a crossover from mean - field to non mean - field behavior , since the avalanche distributions are rather narrow at small stresses and the change in @xmath22 could be spurious .",
    "however , further evidence for mean field behavior is given by the scaling of the cutoff of @xmath19 with stress .",
    "the location of the cutoff , @xmath43 , is dictated by how close the external stress is to its critical value , and is given by the scaling relation @xmath44 where @xmath45 takes the value @xmath46 in the mean field universality class .",
    "figure  [ tail_collapse_small_stress](a ) shows the collapse of the tails of @xmath19 for small stresses when @xmath47 is rescaled in this way .    on the other hand , in contrast to the image sum kernel , at small",
    "stresses the fourier discretized kernel does not give rise to a mean field regime . as shown in the inset of figure  [ fit_small_stress](a ) , fitting the distributions @xmath19 ( obtained for stress bins of width @xmath20 ) with the form given in eq .",
    "yields an exponent @xmath48 , with no clear stress dependence , even at small stresses . furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tail_collapse_small_stress](b ) , for small stresses the cutoffs of the avalanche size distributions scale as @xmath49 , which is also not consistent with mean field theory .",
    "it therefore seems likely that if mean field behavior does occur , it is only for extremely small stresses .      to better understand this system at criticality , we perform strain - controlled simulations in which the plastic system is coupled to a spring of stiffness @xmath50 .",
    "the total strain in the system , @xmath51  sum of the plastic strain @xmath52 and the spring extension  is increased adiabatically . in the absence of a plastic subsystem , @xmath51",
    "would be attained at an external stress @xmath53 , following hooke s law .",

    "the plastic system can be maintained indefinitely in a critical steady state , allowing us to collect detailed avalanche statistics .",

    "to summarize : we have seen that plasticity in 2d amorphous materials has non mean - field critical behavior , which is universal .",
    "we have also seen that , depending on details of the interaction kernel , mean field behavior can be recovered away from the critical point .",
    "these two observations are linked by the localization of strain , which depends strongly on short - range interactions . while both kernels lead to localization into narrow features , the strain localization for the fourier kernel appears to be closely related to the square lattice on which the model is discretized , with features having a width of a single lattice site . when strain is not localized",
    " as in the case of the image sum kernel away from criticality  behavior consistent with mean - field depinning is recovered .",
    "furthermore , as indicated by the striking difference between the two kernels in the weakening tests , nonuniversal features relating to strain localization are not simply curiosities , but also have implications for how the `` depinning '' model for amorphous plasticity can be applied to real materials .",
    "while long - lived , spatially - localized strain features are universal , the fact that their stability depends strongly on short - range interactions raises serious questions about the physical interpretation of `` shear bands '' in systems governed by the fourier kernel . as noted already ( see fig .  [ kernels ] ) , the fourier kernel noticeably deviates from @xmath5 scaling in the first and second neighbor interactions on a square lattice , and behavior that derives from this deviation should be considered a spurious lattice effect .",
    "because of strain localization , one hypothesis for the non mean field behavior of the model is dimensional reduction , that is , as criticality is approached , the system becomes effectively a set of ( almost ) noninteracting 1d subsystems .",
    "however , the exponents @xmath93 and @xmath94 are not consistent with the values expected in a 1d system with @xmath5 interactions ( i.e @xmath95 and @xmath96  @xcite ; see table  [ exponents_comparison ] ) . furthermore , as discussed above , avalanches at criticality have dimensionality above @xmath76 . in other words , although there is spatial localization of strain , we do not observe complete dimensional reduction , for either kernel .",
    "intriguingly , recent simulation studies  @xcite of magnetic domains in thin films with long - range dipolar interactions report an avalanche exponent @xmath97 .",
    "it remains an open question whether this model shares the universality class of two dimensional amorphous plasticity .",
