    "<S> low mass vector meson ( @xmath7 ) production provides key information on the hot and dense state of strongly interacting matter produced in high - energy heavy ion collisions . among them , strangeness enhancement can be accessed through the measurement of @xmath0 meson production , while the measurement of the @xmath8 spectral function can be used to reveal in - medium modifications of hadron properties close to the qcd phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> vector meson production in pp collisions provides a reference for these studies . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is interesting by itself , since it can be used to tune particle production models in the unexplored lhc energy range .    </S>",
    "<S> the alice experiment at the lhc can access vector mesons produced at forward rapidity through their decays in muon pairs , and at central rapidity in the di - electron decay channel . </S>",
    "<S> the detector is fully described in  @xcite . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> results from the analysis of the data collected during the 2010 pp run at @xmath2  tev are reported .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurement in the dimuon channel was performed using the forward muon spectrometer , that consists of an absorber acting as muon filter , a set of cathod pad chambers ( five stations , each one composed of two chambers ) for the track reconstruction in a dipole field , two stations of two resistive plate chambers for the muon trigger , two absorbers and an iron wall acting as a muon filter .    the data sample used for the analysis in the dimuon channel amounts to an integrated luminosity of approximately 85  nb@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> since only a fraction of the data contained the full information relevant for the extraction of the integrated luminosity , a subsample corresponding to @xmath10 was used for the measurement of the @xmath0 cross section , while the full sample was used to extract the @xmath11 distribution . </S>",
    "<S> muon pairs were selected asking that each muon track reconstructed in the tracking chambers matches the corresponding tracklet in the trigger stations in the position in the ( x - y ) plane and in the slope in the ( r - z ) plane . </S>",
    "<S> a cut on the muon rapidity @xmath12 was applied in order to remove the tracks close to the acceptance borders . </S>",
    "<S> about 291,000 opposite sign @xmath13 , 197,000 like - sign @xmath14 muon pairs survived these selections .    </S>",
    "<S> the combinatorial background was evaluated using the event mixing technique , and normalized to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the acceptance for a ( @xmath18 ) pair . </S>",
    "<S> the event mixing was checked by comparing the results obtained for like - sign mixed pairs with the real ones . </S>",
    "<S> the shapes of the background calculated with the two methods are identical , while the amount of like - sign pairs estimated with the event mixing differs from the one in the real data by @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we take this value as the uncertainty on the background normalization . </S>",
    "<S> the signal - to - background ratio for @xmath4  gev/@xmath20 is about 1 at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the combinatorial background contribution to the opposite sign mass spectrum for a given @xmath21 mass bin can be evaluated from the like sign mass spectra using the formula : @xmath22 the two techniques are in good agreement for @xmath23  gev/@xmath20 , while for lower pair transverse momenta both methods fail in describing the background . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is thus limited to @xmath4  gev@xmath5 .    after subtracting the combinatorial background from the opposite sign mass spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the signal mass spectrum shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phi_all ] ( left ) . </S>",
    "<S> the invariant mass spectrum is fitted with the contributions given by the light meson decays into muons and open charm / beauty contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the free parameters of the fit are the normalizations of the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and open charm signals . </S>",
    "<S> the other processes ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and open beauty ) are fixed according to the relative branching ratios or cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the main sources of systematic uncertainty are due to the uncertainty in the background normalization and on the relative normalization of the sources , mainly due to the error on the branching ratios for the @xmath1 and @xmath31 dalitz decays . </S>",
    "<S> the raw number of @xmath0 and @xmath32 resonances obtained from the fit is @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 production cross section was evaluated in the range @xmath6 , @xmath35  gev/@xmath20 through the formula @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the measured number of @xmath0 mesons corrected for the efficiency and the acceptance , @xmath38 is the branching ratio in lepton pairs , obtained as a weighted average of the branching ratios in @xmath39 and @xmath40 pairs  @xcite , @xmath41 is the number of minimum bias collisions , @xmath42 is the alice minimum bias cross section in pp collisions at @xmath2  tev and @xmath43 is the ratio between the number of single muons in the region @xmath44 , @xmath45  gev/@xmath20 collected with the minimum bias trigger and with the muon trigger . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum bias cross section was measured in a van der meer scan  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its value is @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of minimum bias collisions was corrected , run by run , for the probability of having multiple interactions in a single bunch crossing . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath43 strongly depends on the data taking conditions and was evaluated run by run . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic error comes from the uncertainty on the background subtraction ( @xmath48 ) , the muon trigger efficiency ( @xmath49 ) , the tracking efficiency ( @xmath50 ) the uncertainty on the @xmath0 branching ratio into dileptons ( @xmath51 ) , on the minimum bias cross section ( @xmath52 ) and on the ratio @xmath43 ( @xmath50 ) .    the @xmath3-differential cross section @xmath53 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phi_all ] ( triangles ) . point to point uncorrelated systematic uncertainties are indicated as red boxes . </S>",
    "<S> the fully correlated systematic uncertainty , represented by a blue box on the left side of the plot , amounts to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> a fit to the differential cross section with a power law function , @xmath55^n$ ] , gives @xmath56  gev/@xmath20 and @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements in kaon pairs performed by lhcb in a similar rapidity range ( @xmath58 , open circles )  @xcite and by alice at midrapidity ( @xmath59 , full circles )  @xcite are also plotted , showing that the shapes are similar . </S>",
    "<S> the rescaling of the lhcb cross section to @xmath4 gev@xmath5 and to @xmath60 leads to @xmath61  mb . </S>",
    "<S> there is a @xmath62 difference between the alice and lhcb measurements . </S>",
    "<S> considering the alice statistical error and the part of the systematic uncertainty which are certainly not correlated among the two experiments , the two measurements are in agreement .    </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath63 was measured as a function of the transverse momentum , showing a flat trend with an average value of @xmath64 . in order to extract the @xmath1 cross section , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 and @xmath1 contributions must be disentangled , leaving the @xmath8 normalization as an additional free parameter in the fit to the dimuon mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the fit gives @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic uncertainty was evaluated changing the normalizations of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 according to the uncertainties in their branching ratios , and the background level by @xmath68 , twice the uncertainty in the normalization . from these results , </S>",
    "<S> it was possible to extract the ratio @xmath69 . this ratio is plotted as a function of @xmath3 in fig .  </S>",
