    "neutrino  photon interactions can play an important role in astrophysical and cosmological phenomena such as stellar evolution , production of high energy cosmic rays , detecting the relic neutrino background . in the past few decades this type of interactions has attracted some interest and a definite progress has been reached in this field @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been realized that the inelastic process @xmath1 significantly dominates over elastic scattering @xmath2 @xcite . in its turn ,",
    "when the energy threshold of the electron ",
    "positron pair production is crossed , the reaction @xmath3 becomes the dominant one  @xcite .",
    "neutrino  photon reactions with relatively low energy thresholds as those mentioned above are of special interest for astrophysics .",
    "they are crucial for understanding processes of the energy loss by stars @xcite , especially the collapsing ones , when they may loose a significant part of their masses by the neutrino emission @xcite .    in the conservative estimation , temperature in the interiors of a supernova ranges from 10 mev up to 100 mev and @xmath4 reactions",
    "are therefore able to produce final states with masses as large as the mass of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "thus , in addition to the traditionally considered energy loss resulting from production of structureless particles in inelastic @xmath4 scattering  @xcite , pair , photo- , plasma , bremsstrahlung and recombination neutrino processes  @xcite , one should also take into account the possibility of excitation of states like the @xmath0 mesons by neutrinos propagating through the star .    due to above reasons the exclusive production of the @xmath0 mesons in the reactions    @xmath5",
    "is studied in the present paper . in ( [ reac2 ] )",
    "@xmath6 stands for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted that the reactions ( [ reac1 ] ) and ( [ reac2 ] ) have not only astrophysical implications but also provide crucial tests of the standard model .",
    "actually , ( [ reac1 ] ) is the crossed reaction of the radiative pion decay @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the latter and other light pseudoscalar decays are extensively discussed in the literature as possible tests of the @xmath12 structure of the weak interaction ( see , for example , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "processes closely related to ( [ reac2 ] ) are also candidate solutions of the problem of the excess of electron - like events observed by the miniboone collaboration in a search for @xmath13 oscillations which arouses a hot discussion today @xcite .",
    "let us consider the reaction ( [ reac1 ] ) at low momentum transfer satisfying the condition  @xmath15 so that one may use the fermi approximation .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams in the leading order are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "one can show that the contributions of the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) are helicity suppressed being proportional to the electron mass @xmath16 exactly as in the case of the @xmath17 decay @xcite .",
    "for this reason we will neglect them in the subsequent calculations keeping only the diagram ( c ) which is free of the suppression and depends on the vector and axial - vector weak hadronic currents characterizing the structure of the pion @xcite . then , noting that ( [ reac1 ] ) is a crossed reaction of the decay @xmath11 one can find the amplitude just by crossing the corresponding result of @xcite :    @xmath18 , \\label{ampl_decay}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element , @xmath20 is the photon polarization vector , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the four momenta of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the axial - vector and vector form factors .    squaring ( [ ampl_decay ] ) , averaging over the two spin states of the initial photon , summing over the final state spins gives    @xmath31    where the conventional mandelstam variables are used : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .    knowing ( [ ampl_d_squared ] ) one obtains the differential cross section    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the fine structure constant .",
    "integration of ( [ cross_sect ] ) over the physically possible values of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) yields the total cross section of the reaction ( [ reac1 ] ) :    @xmath39    note that though the formfactors depend , in general , on @xmath37 , in the present analysis they are taken to be constants since we deal with reactions proceeding at conditions comparable to the case of the decay @xmath11 ( @xmath40 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , throughout this paper we set @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the total cross section on the center - of - mass energy  @xmath43 is plotted in fig .",
    "one can see that its values are comparable to those of the process @xmath44",
    "@xcite at @xmath45 exceeding the latter by about two orders of magnitude at higher energies .",
    "conclusions regarding the significance of the reaction ( [ reac1 ] ) for particle physics are the following .",
    "information on the formfactors @xmath46 and @xmath47 is important for testing the standard model , their theoretical values depend on a model and vary in a relatively wide region @xcite .",
    "the reaction ( [ reac1 ] ) allows to experimentally measure the formfactors in a wider range of the values of @xmath37 than it is possible in the decay @xmath11 .",
    "for example , ( [ reac1 ] ) can be studied in scattering of neutrinos from nuclei exploiting the equivalent photon flux of the latter . in this connection",
    "another interesting problem concerning the universality of the equivalent photon approximation as a particular case of the parton model arises @xcite .",
    "let us consider the reaction ( [ reac2 ] ) , which is in fact the primakoff effect  @xcite proceeding due to weak interactions .",
    "it is convenient to invoke the conserved vector current hypothesis to find the amplitude for ( [ reac2 ] ) , which then can be easily obtained from ( [ ampl_decay ] ) by setting the formfactor @xmath48 ( and , of course , simultaneously removing @xmath19 and replacing the final state electron with a neutrino ) :    @xmath49    one can see that ( [ ampl_2 ] ) is in agreement with the lagrangian from @xcite where processes related to ( [ reac2 ] ) by crossing have been studied .",
    "it is now straightforward to find the cross sections of ( [ reac2 ] ) and its crossed reactions using the results of the subsec .",
    "[ subsec : charged ] .",
    "thus , setting @xmath48 in ( [ cross_sect ] ) one obtains the differential cross section of ( [ reac2 ] ) :    @xmath50    which leads , after the integration over @xmath37 , to the total cross section    @xmath51    the dependence of the total cross section on @xmath43 is plotted in fig .",
    "conclusions regarding the role playing by the reaction ( [ reac2 ] ) for evolution of a supernova as well as for particle physics is the same as in the subsec .",
    "[ subsec : charged ] .",
    "but there is also a notable distinctive feature owing to the dominant decay of the final state neutral pion into the @xmath52 pair .",
    "if the reaction ( [ reac2 ] ) proceeds in the interiors of the star than it will be accompanied by radiation of photons with change in their spectrum at the energy @xmath53  mev .",
    "it is also interesting to consider some of the crossed reactions of ( [ reac1 ] ) and ( [ reac2 ] ) like the following annihilation process :    @xmath55    one can similarly calculate the total cross section of the reaction ( [ annihil ] ) as above :    @xmath56    the dependence of the cross section on @xmath43 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    as can be seen from ( [ cross_s_tann ] ) ,",
    "an important advantage of using the process ( [ annihil ] ) is that it determines the sum of squares of the formfactors :    @xmath57      let us also consider the following annihilation process :    @xmath59    its total cross section calculated exactly as in the case of the reaction ( [ annihil ] ) reads    @xmath60    and the corresponding dependence on @xmath43 is plotted in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "in addition to similar processes such as @xmath61 @xcite , the process  ( [ annihil2 ] ) is also of some interest for cosmology since it can in principle unveil the cosmic neutrino background remaining still experimentally undetected . at the same time",
    "there are at least two advantages of the process ( 13 ) over @xmath61 .",
    "the first one is the magnitude of its cross section exceeding the corresponding quantity of @xmath61 by factor @xmath62 in the considered energy range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the second one is the fact that the identification of the final state photons appearing through excitation of the @xmath63 mesons and their subsequent decays is more unambiguous due to the well known distinctive features of the @xmath52 invariant mass spectrum expected in this case .",
    "the exclusive reactions @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 have been studied within the standard model . neglecting the helicity suppressed terms @xmath68 ,",
    "the corresponding cross sections are calculated analytically in the fermi approximation .",
    "some potential astrophysical implications are discussed .",
    "for example , it is shown that the pions can be produced in the interiors of a supernova in the reactions @xmath64 , @xmath65 whose role for evolution of the star being less important than that of neutrino  nucleon scattering is however comparable to the corresponding significance of production of structureless particles in @xmath4 interactions .",
    "the reaction @xmath65 can be identified by change in the spectrum of photons at about 67.5  mev appearing due to the decay of the final state neutral pions into the @xmath52 pairs .",
    "it is also emphasized that @xmath64 , @xmath66 are crossed reactions of the decay @xmath69 and therefore can also be used to test the @xmath12 structure of the weak interaction as well as to search for physics beyond the standard model covering however a wider kinematical region than it is possible in the case of the mentioned charged pion decay .",
    "though only neutrino ",
    "photon reactions have been considered , all the calculations and discussion of this paper will be obviously exactly the same for the corresponding antineutrino  photon cases provided cp is conserved . moreover",
    ", other pseudoscalar mesons can be treated in similar way . in particular , obtaining the cross section for the reaction @xmath70 is straightforward .",
    "it is enough to replace the formfactors and the mass of @xmath71 in ( [ cross_sect_tot ] ) by the corresponding quantities of @xmath72 and to insert the ckm matrix element @xmath73 instead of @xmath19 .",
    "likewise , production of the neutral kaon @xmath74 can be considered , the latter may be interesting due to its participation in cp violating interactions .",
    "the formalism of this paper is also applicable to production of hypothetical pseudoscalar particles like axions .",
