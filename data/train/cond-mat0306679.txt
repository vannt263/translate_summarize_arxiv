    "the experimental realization of quasi-2d frustrated antiferromagnets,@xcite such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 has recently generated a renewed interest in the physics of the so - called _ collinear _ antiferromagnets . in these compounds",
    "the relevant superexchange interactions involve @xmath6 ions on weakly coupled stacked planes , and the magnetic behavior is likely to be described by the @xmath0 heisenberg model on the square lattice , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the ( positive ) nearest - neighbor ( _ n.n . _ ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( _ n.n.n .",

    "these two families of states break not only the su(2 ) symmetry and the translational invariance of the hamiltonian , as the conventional nel state , but also its invariance under @xmath15 real - space rotations .",

    "to this purpose , a previously introduced finite - size @xmath17 theory @xcite is generalized to the collinear phase and a direct comparison with lanczos exact diagonalization results @xcite is performed for @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to demonstrate the effectiveness of @xmath17 theory in describing the low - energy properties of the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet in the experimentally relevant regime @xmath10 .",
    "the finite - size @xmath17 theory of zhong and sorella,@xcite is a rigorous generalization of the standard @xmath17 approach to finite clusters with @xmath18 sites , which allows one to avoid the spurious goldstone - mode divergences  related to the su(2 ) symmetry breaking assumption  in a straightforward way , without imposing any _ ad hoc _ holonomic constraint on the sublattice magnetization.@xcite in the collinear case , a systematic finite - size @xmath17 expansion can be derived for @xmath12 considering as the approximated ground state the symmetric linear combination @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the ( normalized ) @xmath17 ground states obtained assuming the classical collinear order with @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively . since on any finite size the ground state is expected to have all the spatial symmetries of the hamiltonian it is important to consider the symmetric linear combination ( [ gs ] ) in order to obtain an accurate description of its correlations . in addition , this is also crucial to generalize rigorously the finite - size @xmath17 theory to the collinear phase .    both @xmath21 and @xmath20 in eq .

    "the first step is to apply the unitary transformation which defines a spatially varying reference frame pointing along the local direction of the spins in the classical state , assumed in the @xmath22 plane : @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "then , using the holstein - primakoff spin - boson transformation to first - order in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and translational invariance , the leading term of the hamiltonian in the @xmath17 expansion reads @xmath28\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the classical ground - state energy , and @xmath30 a_r^\\dagger$ ] , with @xmath31 varying in the first brillouin zone of the lattice . here",

    "such leading part of the hamiltonian , being bilinear in the bose operators , can be diagonalized for @xmath35 using the well - known bogoliubov transformation , @xmath36 , with @xmath37  , @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the @xmath17 dispersion relation .",
    "in contrast , the goldstone modes can not be diagonalized by this transformation since @xmath40 and @xmath41 are not defined for the @xmath42-vectors for which @xmath43 . for infinite systems such divergences",
    "are integrable in two dimensions and do not lead to any contribution . on any finite - size system , instead , they are important and they must be treated independently .    to this end , it is possible to define a set of hermitian operators commuting with each other and with the hamiltonian : @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 . with these definitions",
    "the goldstone - mode contribution to ( [ hsw ] ) reads @xmath50 $ ] , with the sum extended only to the four singular modes .",
    "this allows us to diagonalize the hamiltonian for any finite size in a basis where the @xmath51 s have definite quantum numbers . in particular ,",
    "being @xmath52 for @xmath12 , @xmath53 favors a ground state with @xmath54 and it is easy to show that this implies to order @xmath24 @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath58 component of the magnetic structure factor .",
    "these relations together with the sum rules @xmath59 , following from the translational invariance of the @xmath17 hamiltonian , are consistent with a singlet ground - state with a zero value of the total spin on each sublattice .",
    "this is rigorously true according to the lieb - mattis theorem @xcite for @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , in this limit the system decouples into two independent @xmath61 heisenberg models on the two sublattices . in general , a singlet ground state is also expected for the @xmath0 model on any finite size with an even number of sites and non - frustrating boundary conditions .",
    "the sum rules @xmath62 , instead , are not necessarily true on a finite size and for finite values of @xmath63 but they turn out to be fulfilled with good approximation in the collinear phase ( see below ) .    according to this procedure ,",
    "the @xmath17 estimate of the ground - state energy reads , @xmath64 $ ] , and it turns out to be in remarkable agreement with the exact results for @xmath16 and @xmath65 in the whole range @xmath66 ( fig .  [ erg ] ) , i.e. , far enough from the classical critical point @xmath67 separating the collinear from the nel zero - temperature phases .",
    "in fact , in this strongly frustrated regime , a non - magnetic ground state of purely quantum mechanical nature is likely to be stabilized for @xmath16 ( ref . ) .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect @xmath17 theory to fail in describing its correlations . indeed , approaching the fully frustrated point @xmath67 , the @xmath17 expansion eventually breaks down leading to a zero value of the antiferromagnetic order parameter @xcite and of the uniform susceptibility ( see below ) .",

    "in particular , in the collinear case , such rigorous treatment is possible only assuming for the ground state the symmetric form ( [ gs ] ) .",
    "the resulting correlation functions have different expressions depending on the form of the vector @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath76 connecting the same sublattice , they read : @xmath77 if @xmath78 , and @xmath79 if @xmath80 , with the sums extended to all the non singular ( @xmath81 ) @xmath42 s . for",

    "can be also calculated .",
    "in addition , having obtained an ordered expansion in @xmath24 for the spin - spin correlation functions , @xmath89 , the antiferromagnetic order parameter , @xmath90,@xcite can be expanded as @xmath91 with @xmath92 , and it reads : @xmath93~.\\ ] ] note that for @xmath94 the known @xmath17 result @xcite for the thermodynamic order parameter , @xmath95 , is recovered . as shown in fig .",

    ", the @xmath17 approach provides a very accurate estimate ( within a few percent ) of the antiferromagnetic order parameter in the whole range of @xmath100 .",
    "the sharp drop of the order parameter at @xmath101 is suggestive of a first order transition between the gapped and the collinear phase , as also indicated by a recent variational study.@xcite this leads in particular to a very fast saturation of the order parameter to the value of the @xmath61 heisenberg model,@xcite expected for @xmath102 .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath17 prediction for @xmath103 is in excellent agreement with the result of recent neutron scattering measurements @xcite on @xmath3 , giving @xmath104 in the zero temperature limit .",
    "this compound is known to have @xmath105 , even if the precise value of the frustration ratio is presently much debated .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , the weak dependence of the order parameter on @xmath63 for @xmath103 does not allow to use the @xmath17 prediction to determine more precisely this ratio .    within the finite - size @xmath17 theory , it is also possible to study the structure of the low - energy spin excitation spectrum which is connected to the ground - state antiferromagnetic correlations and to the uniform susceptibility .",
    "following lavalle _",
    "et al._,@xcite in order to stabilize an excitation of total spin @xmath106 , a zeeman term , @xmath107 , is added to the spin hamiltonian .",
    "classically , for magnetic fields not large enough to induce a spin - flop transition , the classical solution is simply obtained by canting the spins of an angle @xmath108 along the direction of the field @xmath109 [ @xmath110 . after a new rotation of the reference frame in order to align it to the new directions of the spins , the finite - size @xmath17 expansion is straightforward and again it leads to a linearized hamiltonian of the same form of eq .",
    "( [ hsw ] ) with field - dependent coefficients @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and classical energy . in this case , due to the reduced spin - rotation symmetry of the hamiltonian only the @xmath113 and the @xmath46 modes are singular .",
    "the former favors a value of @xmath114 consistent with the applied field , at the classical level , while the latter generates the usual approximated sum rule @xmath115 , which is not affected by the uniform field along the @xmath116 direction .",

    "the energy spectrum @xmath121 can be calculated by means of a legendre transform , @xmath122 . besides",
    ", the uniform susceptibility in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath123 , can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eh ] ) by direct derivation and it reads : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the susceptibility in the classical limit .    due to the discreteness of the energy spectrum ,",
    "a direct comparison of the @xmath17 susceptibility with the exact diagonalization results is not possible on a finite size .",
    "however , in a quantum antiferromagnet with a long - range ordered ground state , the susceptibility is directly related to the properties of the low - energy spectrum and this can be exploited to establish the accuracy of the @xmath17 predictions .",
    "in fact , whenever long - range order is present in the thermodynamic limit , the low - lying spin excitations ( @xmath126 ) order themselves as in the spectrum of a free quantum rotator , @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the so - called _ momentum of inertia _ per site .",
    "this definition is very close to the definition of the uniform spin susceptibility , which can be calculated by taking first the infinite - volume limit of the energy per site at fixed magnetization @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and then letting @xmath131 : @xmath132 .",
    "as it is known from the low - energy theory of a quantum antiferromagnet,@xcite this allows for an identification between @xmath128 and @xmath133 so that the quantity @xmath134^{-1 } = n\\left(e(s)-e_0\\right)\\left[s(s+1)\\right]^{-1}$ ] approaches for infinite size the physical inverse susceptibility @xmath135 , for any spin - excitation @xmath136 .",
    "this features are clearly verified by the @xmath17 scheme as it is illustrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ chisw ] for @xmath97 , where @xmath137 is plotted for @xmath138 and approaches the thermodynamic value calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq.chisw ] ) ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "the comparison with the exact results of the @xmath17 spectrum @xmath140 vs @xmath141 ( inset of fig .  [ chisw ] ) , and , equivalently , of the quantity @xmath142 ( upper panel of fig .  [ chisw ] ) demonstrates the accuracy of @xmath17 theory in estimating the spin susceptibility of the @xmath0 model in the collinear phase for @xmath1 .",
    "as it is shown in the same figure ( upper panel ) , the classical uniform susceptibility is strongly renormalized by quantum fluctuations for @xmath16 at the @xmath17 level . as expected , approaching @xmath67 such reduction is enhanced due to the increased frustration and it leads eventually to the vanishing of the susceptibility for @xmath143 and to the expected transition to a spin - gapped non - magnetic phase.@xcite however , from the comparison with the exact diagonalization results for both the uniform susceptibility and the order parameter , it appears clear that the effects of quantum fluctuations are underestimated by the @xmath17 expansion in the regime of strong frustration so that the transition to the non - magnetic region is likely to occur at slightly higher values of the @xmath63 ratio ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a finite - size spin - wave study of the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet in the collinear phase , focusing in particular on the ground - state spin - spin correlations and the low - energy excitations . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the comparison with exact diagonalization results reveals a remarkable agreement for @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , both the antiferromagnetic structure factor and the spin susceptibility are very close to the spin - wave predictions .",
    "the accuracy of the results on finite sizes indicates that the spin - wave expansion provides a quantitatively reliable description of the ground state of the @xmath0 model in the experimentally relevant regime @xmath105 .",
    "this is confirmed by recent neutron scattering measurements on @xmath3 , providing a value of the order parameter in excellent agreement with the spin - wave prediction in the collinear phase , @xmath2 .",
    "the accuracy of spin - wave theory in describing the low - energy excitations also suggests that theoretical approaches to the thermodynamics based on a gaussian treatment of quantum fluctuations , such as effective hamiltonian methods , @xcite are likely to successfully describe the finite - temperature properties of the @xmath0 model in the collinear phase . work on this line of research would allow to establish a closer contact between the frustrated heisenberg model and the physical properties of the recently synthesized collinear antiferromagnets , helping in their precise characterization and in the determination of the actual frustration ratios .",
