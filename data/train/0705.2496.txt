    "the problem of the dark matter is a long standing problem in modern astrophysics .",
    "two important observational issues , the behavior of the galactic rotation curves and the mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies led to the necessity of considering the existence of dark matter at a galactic and extra - galactic scale .    the rotation curves of spiral galaxies  @xcite are one of the best evidences showing the problems newtonian gravity and/or standard general relativity have to face on the galactic / intergalactic scale . in these galaxies",
    "neutral hydrogen clouds are observed at large distances from the center , much beyond the extent of the luminous matter .",
    "since these clouds move in circular orbits with velocity @xmath0 , the orbits are maintained by the balance between the centrifugal acceleration @xmath1 and the gravitational attraction @xmath2 of the total mass @xmath3 contained within the orbit .",
    "this allows the expression of the mass profile of the galaxy in the form @xmath4 .",
    "observations show that the rotational velocities increase near the center of the galaxy , in agreement with the theory , but then remain nearly constant at a value of @xmath5 km / s  @xcite , which leads to a mass profile @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , the mass within a distance @xmath7 from the center of the galaxy increases linearly with @xmath7 , even at large distances where very little luminous matter has been detected .",
    "the second astrophysical evidence for dark matter comes from the study of the clusters of galaxies .",
    "the total mass of a cluster can be estimated in two ways . knowing the motions of its member galaxies , the virial theorem gives one estimate , @xmath8 , say .",
    "the second is obtained by separately estimating the mass of each individual members , and summing these masses , to give a total baryonic mass @xmath9 . almost without exception",
    "it is found that @xmath8 is considerably greater than @xmath9 , @xmath10 , typical values of @xmath11 being about 20 - 30  @xcite .",
    "this behavior of the galactic rotation curves and of the virial mass of galaxy clusters is usually explained by postulating the existence of some dark ( invisible ) matter , distributed in a spherical halo around the galaxies .",
    "the dark matter is assumed to be a cold , pressure - less medium .",
    "there are many possible candidates for dark matter , the most popular ones being the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) ( for a review of the particle physics aspects of the dark matter see  @xcite ) .",
    "their interaction cross sections with normal baryonic matter , while extremely small , are expected to be non - zero , and we may expect to detect them directly .",
    "it has also been suggested that the dark matter in the universe might be composed of super - heavy particles , with mass @xmath12 gev .",
    "but observational results show that the dark matter can be composed of super - heavy particles only if these interact weakly with normal matter , or if their mass is above @xmath13 gev  @xcite .",
    "scalar fields or other long range coherent fields coupled to gravity have also intensively been used to model galactic dark matter  @xcite .",
    "a general analysis of the possibility of an alternative four - dimensional gravity theory explaining the dynamics of galactic systems without dark matter was performed by zhytnikov and nester @xcite . from very general assumptions about the structure of a relativistic gravity theory ( the theory is metric , and invariant under general coordinates transformation , has a good linear approximation",
    ", it does not possess any unusual gauge freedom and it is not a higher derivative gravity ) a general expression for the metric to order @xmath14 has been derived .",
    "this allows to compare the predictions of the theory with various experimental data : the newtonian limit , light deflection and retardation , rotation of galaxies and gravitational lensing .",
    "the general conclusion of this study is that the possibility for any four - dimensional gravity theory to explain the behavior of galaxies without dark matter is rather improbable .",
    "however , up to now no non - gravitational evidence for dark matter has been found , and no direct evidence or annihilation radiation from it has been observed yet .",
    "therefore , it seems that the possibility that einstein s ( and the newtonian ) theory of gravity breaks down at the scale of galaxies can not be excluded _ a priori_. several theoretical models , based on a modification of newton s law or of general relativity , have been proposed to explain the behavior of the galactic rotation curves  @xcite .",
    "the idea of embedding our universe in a higher dimensional space has attracted a considerable interest recently , due to the proposal by randall and sundrum  @xcite that our four - dimensional ( 4d ) spacetime is a three - brane , embedded in a 5d spacetime ( the bulk ) . according to the brane world scenario , the physical fields ( electromagnetic , yang - mills etc . ) in our 4d universe are confined to the three brane .",
    "only gravity can freely propagate in both the brane and bulk spacetimes , with the gravitational self - couplings not significantly modified . even if the fifth dimension is uncompactified , standard 4d gravity is reproduced on the brane .",
    "hence this model allows the presence of large , or even infinite non - compact extra dimensions .",
    "our brane is identified to a domain wall in a 5d anti - de sitter spacetime . for a review of the dynamics and geometry of brane universes , see e.g.  @xcite .    due to",
    "the correction terms coming from the extra dimensions , significant deviations from the standard einstein theory occur in brane world models at very high energies  @xcite .",
    "gravity is largely modified at the electro - weak scale of about 1  tev .",
    "the cosmological and astrophysical implications of the brane world theories have been extensively investigated in the physical literature  @xcite .",
    "the static vacuum gravitational field equations on the brane depend on the generally unknown weyl stresses , which can be expressed in terms of two functions , called the dark radiation @xmath15 and the dark pressure @xmath16 terms ( the projections of the weyl curvature of the bulk , generating non - local brane stresses )  @xcite .",
    "several classes of spherically symmetric solutions of the static gravitational field equations in the vacuum on the brane have been obtained in  @xcite . as a possible physical application of these solutions",
    "the behavior of the angular velocity @xmath17 of the test particles in stable circular orbits has been considered  @xcite .",
    "the general form of the solution , together with two constants of integration , uniquely determines the rotational velocity of the particle . in the limit of large radial distances , and for a particular set of values of the integration constants the angular velocity tends to a constant value .",
    "this behavior is typical for massive particles ( hydrogen clouds ) outside galaxies  @xcite , and is usually explained by postulating the existence of the dark matter .",
    "thus , the rotational galactic curves can be naturally explained in brane world models , without introducing any additional hypothesis .",
    "the galaxy is embedded in a modified , spherically symmetric geometry , generated by the non - zero contribution of the weyl tensor from the bulk .",
    "the extra terms , which can be described in terms of the dark radiation term @xmath15 and the dark pressure term @xmath16 , act as a `` matter '' distribution outside the galaxy .",
    "the particles moving in this geometry feel the gravitational effects of @xmath15 , which can be expressed in terms of an equivalent mass ( the dark mass ) @xmath18 .",
    "the dark mass is linearly increasing with the distance , and proportional to the baryonic mass of the galaxy , @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the exact galactic metric , the dark radiation and the dark pressure in the flat rotation curves region in the brane world scenario has been obtained in  @xcite .",
    "similar interpretations of the dark matter as bulk effects have been also considered in  @xcite , where it was also shown that it is possible to model the x - ray profiles of clusters of galaxies , without the need for dark matter .    in the brane world scenario ,",
    "the fundamental scale of gravity is not the planck scale , but another scale which may be at the tev level .",
    "the gravitons propagating through the bulk space give rise to a kaluza - klein tower of massive gravitons on the brane . these gravitons",
    "couple to the energy - momentum term of the standard model fields , and could be produced under the appropriate circumstances as real or virtual particles .",
    "another important effect that is expected in the brane world models is the presence of brane fluctuations , since rigid objects do not exist in the relativistic theory .",
    "it was proposed that , in the context of brane world scenarios with low tension @xmath20 , massive brane fluctuations are natural dark matter candidates , called branons @xcite .",
    "the different possibilities for branons as dark matter candidates , the parameter region in which branons behave as collisionless thermal relics ( wimps ) , either cold or hot ( warm ) together with less standard scenarios in which they are strongly self interacting or produced non - thermally , and the possibilities of obtaining branons in hadron accelerators have been considered in @xcite .",
    "another possibility to test these models is through the annihilation of branons into photon or electron - positron pairs in the galactic halos , which could possibly be detected by gamma - ray or anti - matter detectors .",
    "a possible brane world model , which tries to give a justification for the hypothesis of the scalar field origin for the dark matter was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the model contains two branes , on one of the branes lives the matter of the standard model of particles but on the other one , only spin-0 fundamental interactions are present . in the model",
    "the spin-0 fields are the dark matter .",
    "the scalar field contains an effective pressure , which avoids the collapse of the field fluctuations , implying that scalar field dominated objects , like galaxies , may contain a flat density profile in the center .    gravitational lensing and",
    "the study of the light deflection by black holes and galaxies is an important physical effect that could provide specific signatures for testing the brane world models ( for a review of the gravitational lensing by brane world black holes see @xcite ) .",
    "observables related to the relativistic images of strong field gravitational lensing could in principle be used to distinguish between different brane world black hole metrics in future observations .",
    "the strong field limit approach was used in @xcite to investigate the gravitational lensing properties of brane world black holes , and the lensing observables for some candidate brane world black hole metrics have been compared with those for the standard schwarzschild case .",
    "brane world black holes could have significantly different lensing observational signatures as compared to the schwarzschild black holes .",
    "the bending angle predicted by the brane world models is much larger than that predicted by standard general relativistic and dark matter models @xcite .",
    "the deflection of photons and the bending angle of light in the constant tangential velocity region on the brane was considered in @xcite .",
    "the bending angle predicted by the brane world models is much larger than that predicted by standard general relativistic and dark matter models .",
    "therefore , the study of the gravitational lensing could discriminate between the different dynamical laws proposed to model the motion of particles at the galactic level and the standard dark matter models .",
    "generally , the vacuum field equations on the brane can be reduced to a system of two ordinary differential equations , which describe all the geometric properties of the vacuum as functions of the dark pressure and dark radiation terms  @xcite . in order to close the system of vacuum field equations on the brane",
    "a functional relation between these two quantities is necessary .    hence , a first possible approach to the study of the vacuum brane consists in adopting an explicit equation of state for the dark pressure as a function of the dark radiation .",
    "a second method consist in closing the field equations on the brane by imposing the condition of the constancy of the rotational velocity curves for particle in stable orbits .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider the general behavior of the vacuum gravitational field equations in the brane world model in the region of constant tangential rotational velocity of test particles in stable circular orbits .",
    "physically , this situation is characteristic for particles gravitating in circular orbits around the galactic center  @xcite . as a first step in our study we derive , under the assumption of spherical symmetry , the basic equations describing the structure of the vacuum on the brane , and the equation giving the behavior of the tangential velocity of the test particles as functions of the dark radiation and of the dark pressure .    to obtain the tangential velocity of test particles we analyze the motion in an effective potential , also containing the effects of the bulk . by assuming that the brane is a fixed point of the bulk",
    ", we derive the equation giving the tangential velocity as a function of the @xmath21 component of the metric tensor only . in the region of constant tangential velocities ,",
    "the general solutions of the gravitational equations can be obtained in an exact analytic form .",
    "this allows us to obtain the explicit form of the projections of the bulk weyl tensor on the brane ( the dark radiation and the dark pressure ) , as well as the components of the metric tensor .",
    "the mass associated to the dark radiation ( the dark mass ) has a similar behavior as the dark matter at the galactic scale  it is a linearly increasing function of the distance , and it is proportional to the square of the tangential velocity .",
    "this result strongly supports the interpretation of the usual `` dark matter '' as a bulk effect .",
    "all the physical and geometrical quantities in our model are expressed in terms of observable / measurable parameters , like the tangential velocity , the baryonic mass and the radius of the galaxy .",
    "some astrophysical applications of our model , including the possibilities of its observational testing , are also briefly considered .",
    "since generally the structure equations of the vacuum on the brane can not be solved exactly , we shall analyze the dynamics of test particles by using methods from the qualitative analysis of dynamical systems .",
    "in particular , we will investigate the general behavior of the tangential velocity on the brane by assuming a simple linear equation of state for the dark pressure . in this case",
    "generally we can not reproduce the observed behavior of the test particles .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the field equations for the vacuum and the tangential velocity of a test particle on the brane are written down in sections  [ seci ] and  [ secii ] .",
    "the general solution of the field equations in the constant tangential velocity region is obtained in section  [ seciii ] .",
    "the qualitative analysis of the field equations for a linear equation of state for the dark pressure is performed in section  [ seciv ] .",
    "we discuss and conclude our results in section  [ secv ] .",
    "we start by considering a five dimensional ( 5d ) spacetime ( the bulk ) , with a single four - dimensional ( 4d ) brane , on which matter is confined , only gravity can probe the extra dimensions .",
    "the 4d brane world @xmath22 is located at a hypersurface @xmath23 in the 5d bulk spacetime @xmath24 , of which coordinates are described by @xmath25 .",
    "the induced 4d coordinates on the brane are @xmath26 .",

    "in the 5d spacetime a brane is a fixed point of the @xmath44 symmetry .",
    "the basic equations on the brane are obtained by projections onto the brane world .",
    "the induced 4d metric is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the space - like unit vector field normal to the brane hypersurface @xmath47 . in the following we assume @xmath48 .    assuming a metric of the form @xmath49 , with @xmath50 the unit normal to the @xmath51 hypersurfaces and @xmath52 the induced metric on @xmath51 hypersurfaces , the effective 4d gravitational equation on the brane ( the gauss equation ) , takes the form  @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the local quadratic energy - momentum correction @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the non - local effect from the free bulk gravitational field , the transmitted projection of the bulk weyl tensor @xmath57 , @xmath58 , with the property @xmath59as@xmath60 .",
    "we have also denoted @xmath61 , with @xmath62 the usual 4d gravitational constant .",

    "the einstein equation in the bulk and the codazzi equation also imply the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the matter on the brane , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes the brane covariant derivative .",
    "moreover , from the contracted bianchi identities on the brane it follows that the projected weyl tensor obeys the constraint @xmath70 .",

    "for @xmath227 , the two critical points of the system coincide .",
    "depending of the values of @xmath209 , these points lie in different regions of the phase space plane  @xmath228 .",

    "therefore , for such values of @xmath236 the point @xmath231 is an improper asymptotically stable node .    if @xmath237 , we find one positive and one negative eigenvalue , which corresponds to an unstable saddle point at the point @xmath231 .",
    "moreover , since the matrix @xmath238 has real non - vanishing eigenvalues , the point @xmath231 is hyperbolic .",
    "this implies that the properties of the linearized system are also valid for the full non - linear system near the point @xmath231 .",
    "it should be mentioned however , that this first critical point is the less interesting one from a physical point of view , since it corresponds to the ` trivial ' case where both physical variables vanish .    before performing a similar analysis for the second critical point ,",

    "the galactic rotation curves and the mass distributions in clusters of galaxies continue to pose a challenge to present day physics .",
    "one would like to have a better understanding of some of the intriguing phenomena associated with them , like their universality and the very good correlation between the amount of dark matter and the luminous matter in the galaxy .",
    "to explain these observations , the most commonly considered models are based on particle physics in the framework of newtonian gravity , or of some extensions of general relativity  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we have considered , and further developed , an alternative view to the dark matter problem  @xcite , namely , the possibility that the galactic rotation curves and the mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies can naturally be explained in models in which our universe is a brane in a multi - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the extra terms in the gravitational field equations on the brane induce a supplementary gravitational interaction , which can account for the observed behavior of the galactic rotation curves .",
    "as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ dm4 ] ) , in the limit of large @xmath273 , and by taking into account that @xmath274 , we obtain @xmath275 , a behavior which is perfectly consistent with the observational data  @xcite , and is usually attributed to the existence of the dark matter . since inside the galaxy @xmath276 , it follows that the constant tangential velocity of the test particles is determined by the baryonic mass @xmath277 and the radius @xmath84 of the galaxy by the equation @xmath278 .",
    "this gives for the dark mass the scaling relation @xmath279    by using the simple observational fact of the constancy of the galactic rotation curves , the galactic metric and the corresponding components of the projected weyl tensor @xmath280 ( dark radiation and dark pressure ) can be completely reconstructed , without any supplementary assumption .",
    "weak lensing provides a unique probe of the gravitational potential on large scales .",
    "hence , in the context of dark matter , it can provide constrains on the extent and shapes of dark matter halos .",
    "furthermore , it can test alternative theories of gravity ( without dark matter ) . due to the fixed form of the galactic metric on the brane , in our model",
    "the light bending angle is a function of the tangential velocity of particles in stable circular orbit and of the baryonic mass and radius of the galaxy .",
    "the specific form of the bending angle is determined by the brane galactic metric , and this form of the metric is different as compared to the other dark matter models ( long - range self - interacting scalar fields , mond , non - symmetric gravity etc . ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the gravitational light deflection angle is much larger than the value predicted by the standard general relativistic approach .",
    "even when we compare our results with standard dark matter models , like the isothermal dark matter halo model , we still may find significant differences in the lensing effect .",
    "therefore the study of the gravitational lensing may provide the evidence for the existence ( or non - existence ) of the bulk effects on the brane . on the other hand ,",
    "since in this model there is only baryonic matter , all the physical properties at the galactic level are determined by the amount of the luminous matter and its distribution .    to test alternative theories of gravity by using lensing one can use two approaches @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the radial dependence of the lensing signal gives the best accuracy .",
    "this method requires the knowledge of the deflection law .",
    "the most direct test is the detection of the azimuthal variation of the lensing signal around the lenses , and the measurements does not require knowledge of the deflection law .",
    "any anisotropy in the lensing signal caused by the galaxy decreases as @xmath281 and therefore is negligible in the bulk effects dominated region .",
    "the detection of an anisotropy in the lensing signal around galaxies may provide the best test for discriminating between dark matter and alternative gravity models , including the present model .",
    "the results of a study of weak lensing by galaxies based on 45.5 deg@xmath282 of @xmath283 band imaging data from the red - sequence cluster survey were presented in @xcite .",
    "a significant flattening was detected , which implies that the halos are well aligned with the light distribution , and an isotropic lensing signal is excluded with 99.5% confidence .    from an observational point of view",
    "an important problem is to estimate an upper bound for the cutoff of the constancy of the tangential velocities .",
    "the idea is to consider the point at which the decaying density profile of the dark radiation associated to the galaxy becomes smaller than the average energy density of the universe , and the cosmological expansion dominates the dynamics of the particles . let the value of the coordinate radius at the point where the two densities are equal be @xmath284 .",
    "then at this point @xmath285 , where @xmath286 is the mean energy density of the universe .    an alternative estimation of @xmath284 can be obtained from the observational requirement that at the cosmological level the energy density of the dark matter ( which in our case is the dark mass associated to the dark radiation ) represents a fraction @xmath287 of the total energy density of the flat universe , with density parameter @xmath288 .",
    "therefore the `` dark matter '' contribution inside a ball of radius @xmath284 is given by @xmath289 , which gives @xmath290 where @xmath291 is the hubble constant normalized to its local value : @xmath292 , @xmath293 is the total mass density parameter and @xmath294 is the dark energy density parameter . for a tangential velocity of the order of 200 km",
    "/ s it follows that @xmath295 mpc .",
    "therefore , we predict that the flat rotation curves region should extend up to distances of a few megaparsecs from the galactic center .    if we assume that the flat rotation curves extend indefinitely , the resulting spacetime is not asymptotically flat , but of de sitter type .",
    "this is due to the presence of the cosmological constant @xmath63 on the brane .",
    "observationally , the galactic rotation curves remain flat to the farthest distances that can be observed .",
    "therefore , from both the observational and the theoretical point of view it is important to estimate the possible role of the cosmological constant on the extra galactic dynamic . by assuming that the cosmological constant has a numerical value of the order of @xmath296 @xmath297 @xcite , at a distance of @xmath298 kpc , for a galaxy with mass @xmath299 , the quantities @xmath300 and @xmath301 are roughly of the same order of magnitude . for clusters of galaxies with masses of the order of @xmath302 and radii of the order of @xmath303 mpc",
    ", we have @xmath304 and @xmath305 , respectively .",
    "hence the presence of a non - zero cosmological constant may play an important role in the dynamics of the test particles in stable circular orbits at the outer boundary of the galaxies or clusters of galaxies , since it may generate physical effects that are of the same order of magnitude as the extra - dimensional effects from the bulk . therefore , for the correct estimation in regions far away from the galactic center of the dark radiation , of the dark pressure , of the tangential velocities of test particles and of other related effects ( like , for example , the bending angle of the light ) one must take into account the effect of the cosmological constant on the brane .    in the present model",
    "all the relevant physical quantities , including the dark mass ( playing the role of the dark matter on the brane ) , the dark radiation and the dark pressure describing the non - local effects due to the gravitational field of the bulk , are expressed in terms of observable parameters  the tangential velocity , the baryonic mass and the radius of the galaxy .",
    "there are three observationally testable predictions of the model : a ) the constant rotation curve region may extend much farther than presently observed , up to a few megaparsecs , b ) the weak lensing effect in the dark radiation dominated region is different from that predicted by the standard dark matter models , and other alternative gravitational theories and c ) the numerical value of the maximum rotational velocity is mainly determined by the `` normal '' matter content of the galaxy .    as for the main advantages of our model , on the one hand it is esthetically attractive ",
    "`` matter '' is a manifestation of geometry , it is relatively simple and , on the other hand , it is directly testable observationally .",
    "the best testing ground for brane world models is the extra - galactic space , where the effects of galactic / extra - galactic matter perturbations are minimal , and where we expect that the bulk effects appear in a `` pure '' form , and they dominate the dynamics of test particles ( gas clouds ) .",
    "moreover , the extra - galactic space is accessible to direct optical or radio observation . in the solar system",
    "the bulk effects are very small , and difficult to observe .",
    "therefore , these results open the possibility of testing the brane world models by using direct astronomical and astrophysical observations at the galactic or extra galactic scale . in this paper",
    "we have provided some basic theoretical tools necessary for the in depth comparison of the predictions of brane world models and of the observational results .",
