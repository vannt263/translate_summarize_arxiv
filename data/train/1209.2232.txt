    "observing the behavior of electrons in graphene under high magnetic field has played an important role not only for uncovering new quantum hall states , but also for proving the very existence of massless dirac particles  @xcite .",
    "affected by the linear dispersion near dirac points , landau levels are formed in graphene such that their energy is scaled as @xmath1 in units of @xmath2 with @xmath3 , the landau level index , allowed for all integers including positive , zero , and negative  @xcite . in the above , @xmath4 is the fermi velocity at the dirac point and @xmath5 is the magnetic length .",
    "the @xmath0 landau level offers a particularly intriguing departure from the usual quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in that its hall coefficient is shifted by half an integer . with both spin and valley degeneracy taken into account ,",
    "the consequent hall conductance is predicted to be quantized in the form of @xmath6 in units of @xmath7 , which exhibits beautiful agreement with experiment  @xcite",
    ".    there is , however , a glaring omission in the discussion so far . in the above , the effect of lattice",
    "is completely ignored except that the electron dispersion becomes linear near dirac points .",
    "the question is how valid this assumption can be .",
    "more specifically , will there be any changes in the landau - level structure once the effect of lattice is better incorporated ?",
    "navely speaking , since the deviation from the linear dispersion occurs in relatively high energy , one may expect that the landau levels should be more or less the same as before so that they remain as flat bands .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 landau level is then expected to remain as a flat band pinned exactly at zero energy due to the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "seemingly innocuous , if true , this expectation gives rise to a very puzzling question : what determines which states within the @xmath0 landau level evolves into the particle ( or the positive energy ) branch and which into the hole ( or the negative energy ) branch at the edge ?",
    "a natural resolution of this puzzle is that the @xmath0 landau level is broadened with its bandwidth becoming finite .",
    "if so , what would be the nature of such bandwidth - broadened @xmath0 landau level",
    "?    the quantum mechanical problem of an electron moving in lattice under magnetic field is generally known as the azbel - hofstadter problem named after azbel  @xcite , who originally proposed the model , and hofstadter  @xcite , who first obtained a numerical solution in the square lattice and showed the existence of a self - similar fractal structure in energy eigenvalue , dubbed as the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "the actual equations , that need to be solved , are known as harper s equations which are in fact nothing but the energy eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian matrix . by numerically solving harper s equations ,",
    "the self - similar fractal structure of the azbel - hofstadter model was found also for various other lattices including the triangular and the honeycomb lattice  @xcite .",
    "in addition to numerical studies solving harper s equation , there have been extensive efforts to obtain analytic solutions  @xcite .",
    "the reason for such efforts is multifaceted .",
    "for one , many researchers have been curious about the very origin of the self - similar fractal structure seen in the hofstadter butterfly and tried to make a connection to other known systems exhibiting similar fractal structures . for another",
    ", numerical computations can be performed only in the situation where the magnetic flux per unit cell , @xmath8 , is a rational fraction of the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , what happens at irrational fractions can be addressed only by the analytic approaches . perhaps , the most important reason in connection with experiment is the fact that the numerical approach can not access the weak - field limit where the size of the matrix that needs to be diagonalized diverges .",
    "the weak - field limit is most relevant for experiment since , even in the quantum hall regime , the magnetic flux per unit cell is typically much less than @xmath10 in units of magnetic flux quantum .    among various analytic approaches ,",
    "the bethe - ansatz approach is regarded to be most systematic , where the azbel - hofstader problem is converted into solving the bethe - ansatz equations whose roots are directly connected to the energy eigenvalues as well as eigenstates . despite providing such insightful relationship to an integrable model , the bethe - ansatz approach is proven to be of little practical use since the bethe - ansatz equations are generally insoluble except for special cases .",
    "the use of other analytic approaches is also similarly limited .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a method that can be used to provide an accurate analytic description of the evolution of the @xmath0 landau level as a function of magnetic field ranging from being arbitrarily weak to moderately strong . in this method",
    ", it is shown that , for @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 being coprime positive integers , the central band of the hofstadter butterfly , which is obtained from the original @xmath14 matrix for harper s equations , is captured extremely accurately by diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian matrix with a much reduced size of @xmath15 in the weak - field regime .",
    "the central band of the hofstadter butterfly is connected with the @xmath0 landau level in the continuum limit .",
    "actually , this effective hamiltonian matrix works quite well for @xmath16 as large as @xmath17 .",
    "one of the most important discoveries of this work is that , no matter how small the magnetic flux per unit cell may become , the central hofstadter band ( chb ) always contains massless dirac particles whose energy dispersion is completely isomorphic to that in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "in fact , by combining the self - similar pattern of the central hofstadter band and some analytic as well as numerical results for the zero - energy modes of harper s equations , we conclude that there should be exactly @xmath18 dirac cones in the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) for @xmath11 with arbitrary @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "a corollary of this result is that there should also be a self - similar occurrence of landau levels associated with such dirac cones .    in order to assess the experimental feasibility of observing such massless dirac particles within the central hofstadter band , we compute the width of the central hofstadter band which",
    ", for small @xmath16 , is predicted to scale as @xmath19 in units of the energy level spacing between the @xmath0 and @xmath20 landau level , @xmath2 .",
    "here , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is called the clausen function . actually , motivated by an intriguing conjecture proposed by thouless  @xcite",
    "a while ago , there has been a long history for addressing how the total bandwidth of the hofstadter butterfly scales as a function of magnetic field  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our result is the first report for the scaling of the hofstadter butterfly bandwidth in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "considering difficulties in directly observing the hofstadter butterfly under magnetic field with typically available strength , we believe that a precise measurement of the bandwidth itself can be used to infer the existence of the hofstadter butterfly in addition to the diophantine equation for the quantized hall conductance  @xcite .",

    "<S> intricate interplay between the periodicity of the lattice structure and that of the cyclotron motion gives rise to a well - known self - similar fractal structure of the energy eigenvalue , known as the hofstadter butterfly , for an electron moving in lattice under magnetic field . evolving from the @xmath0 landau level , </S>",
    "<S> the central band of the hofstadter butterfly is especially interesting since it may hold a key to the mysteries of the fractional quantum hall effect observed in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> while the entire hofstadter butterfly can be in principle obtained by solving harper s equations numerically , the weak - field limit , most relevant for experiment , is intractable due to the fact that the size of the hamiltonian matrix , that needs to be diagonalized , diverges . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we develop an effective hamiltonian method that can be used to provide an accurate analytic description of the central hofstadter band in the weak - field regime . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important discoveries obtained in this work is that massless dirac particles always exist inside the central hofstadter band no matter how small the magnetic flux may become . in other words , with its bandwidth broadened by the lattice effect , the @xmath0 landau level contains massless dirac particles within itself . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , by carefully analyzing the self - similar recursive pattern of the central hofstadter band , we conclude that massless dirac particles should occur under arbitrary magnetic field . as a corollary </S>",
    "<S> , the central hofstadter band also contains a self - similar structure of recursive landau levels associated with such massless dirac particles . to assess the experimental feasibility of observing massless dirac particles inside the central hofstadter band , we compute the width of the central hofstadter band as a function of magnetic field in the weak - field regime . </S>"
