    "<S> we show that majorana fermions associated with majorana flat bands emerge as zero energy modes on the [ 110 ] edge of single layer or multilayer nodal superconductors with @xmath0-wave pairing and rashba spin - orbit coupling . moreover , as long as the global inversion symmetry of the single layer or multilayer superconductor is broken , and in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field parallel to the [ 110 ] edge , the majorana fermions together with usual fermionic andreev bound states induce a triple - peak structure in tunnelling spectroscopy experiments . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we show that the zero bias conductance peak is induced by majorana fermions . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , tunnelling spectroscopy can be used to probe majorana fermions in nodal @xmath0-wave superconductors . </S>"
