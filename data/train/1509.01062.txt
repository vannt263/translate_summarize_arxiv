    "one of the key features of any programming language is _ conditional statements _ , that run an arbitrary gate depending on the value of a controlling variable .",
    "the boolean `` if - then '' construct is fundamental to break code sequentiality , it allows the implementation of conditional loops and it prevents recursion from being infinite .    also in quantum computation controlled gates play a crucial role .",
    "this is the case , e.g.  for the ubiquitous controlled - not ( c - not ) , which is the pillar of most quantum algorithms @xcite ( a remarkable example is the shor s algorithm @xcite , that relies on controlled routines for period - finding ) .",
    "the crucial difference between classical and quantum controlled gates is that the latter allow for the control qubit to be in a superposition of states .",
    "this fact leads to a further , radical difference with respect to classical computation . indeed , while the requirement that the gate is a variable of  as opposed to being hard - coded into  the `` if - then '' construct can be trivially implemented in the classical world , it turns out to be impossible in the quantum one , as first noticed by kitaev  @xcite more than two decades ago .",
    "as it was recently shown  @xcite , quantum theory prevents the implementation of a universal quantum `` if - then '' construct , namely one that can control the entire set of unitary gates , that is , no black - box transformation can map @xmath0 to controlled-@xmath0 for any unitary @xmath0 .",
    "this is a serious limitation , as it implies that one should provide a different implementation of the `` if - then '' construct for each controlled gate in the algorithm .",
    "on the other hand , there exist sets of unitary transformations for which the implementation of a control is possible .",
    "simple examples are : i ) the sets of jointly perfectly discriminable unitaries ; ii ) the sets such that , for a given state @xmath1 , one has @xmath2 for all the unitaries in the set .",
    "the latter example corresponds to the setting of refs .",
    "@xcite , where is trivially the vacuum state , and of refs .",
    "@xcite , and shares similarities with that of ref .",
    "it is also straightforward to notice that any set made of two unitary transformations is always controllable , since if is an eigenstate of then .    despite its relevance and the recent interest in the problem",
    ", the pivotal question remains unanswered : _",
    "what are the sets of gates that quantum theory allows to be controlled through a conditional statement ? _    here , we answer this question by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of quantum gates to be controllable by a quantum `` if - then '' clause .",
    "surprisingly , our result unveils a connection between the controllability problem and the task of extracting information from an unknown quantum gate while using it .",
    "in operational terms , a general reversible quantum gate @xmath3 consists of a black box transforming its input ( left wire ) into its output ( right wire ) .",
    "the action of @xmath3 on state @xmath4 is represented by a unitary operator @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 denotes the identity matrix ) .",
    "we say that the unitary operator @xmath0 is a _ representative _ of the gate @xmath3 .",
    "clearly , a gate @xmath3 admits several representatative unitaries , differing by a physically irrelevant _ global _ phase @xmath8 . in this work",
    "we use the term _ unitary _ when referring to a particular representative of a _",
    "gate_.    for some particular choice of representative @xmath0 , the controlled gate c-@xmath3 acts on the system as the identity operator @xmath7 if the control qubit is initialized in state @xmath9 , while it performs @xmath0 if the control qubit is in state @xmath10 , namely @xmath11 since a phase in front of @xmath0 in eq .",
    "is _ local _ rather than global , different choices of the representative for the same gate @xmath3 clearly correspond to physically inequivalent controlled gates .    to address the problem in the most general case , we must consider a generic map that transforms the gate @xmath3 into its controlled version c-@xmath3 .",
    "from the theory of _ quantum combs _  @xcite it is well known that the most general transformation allowed by quantum theory on a quantum gate @xmath3 is realized by inserting @xmath3 in a quantum circuit board .",
    "explicitly , if a map which transforms @xmath3 into c-@xmath3 exists , it corresponds to the following circuit ( further details are given in the methods section ) : @xmath12 in formula @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the preparation of an ancillary ready state @xmath9 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote unitary transformations , @xmath0 is a representative of @xmath3 , and @xmath17 is a state that depends on @xmath0 .",
    "it is important to remark that the dimension of the hilbert space in the circuit in eq .",
    "is always bounded  @xcite .",
    "the freedom in the choice of the representative , leading to many inequivalent controlled gates , requires to split the formulation of the controllability problem into two sub - problems .",
    "the first one regards controllability of a set of representatives    given a set @xmath18 of gates and a set @xmath19 of representatives of @xmath18 , we say that @xmath18 is _ controllable with representatives @xmath19 _ if there exists @xmath15 and @xmath16 such that eq",
    ".   holds for any @xmath20 .",
    "the second question regards the existence of such a set of representatives , as follows .",
    "we say that a set @xmath18 of gates is _ controllable _ if there exists a set @xmath19 of representatives of @xmath18 such that @xmath18 is _ controllable with representatives @xmath19_.",
    "equation   makes it manifest that , along with the desired task of controlling @xmath0 , some side information about the unknown unitary @xmath0 can in principle be stored in state @xmath17 .",
    "the study of this side information plays a fundamental role in our analysis of controllability . to make this explicit ,",
    "consider the case in which the control state in eq .",
    "is set to @xmath10 .",
    "we have then @xmath21 equation   is an instance of the information - disturbance trade - off problem in estimating a quantum transformation @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that we are provided with a black box implementing a single use of an unknown transformation @xmath0 belonging to a given set @xmath19 . on one hand , one wants to identify the unknown transformation @xmath0 , while on the other hand one is interested in applying the black box on a variable input state .",
    "in general these two tasks are incompatible , and there is a trade - off between the amount of information that can be obtained about a black box and the disturbance caused on its action , with an exception : when the black boxes can be jointly discriminated without error @xcite , and then also reproduced .",
    "the circuit in eq .   fixes a scenario in which the unknown unitary must be left unperturbed .",
    "although we defer the details to the methods section , it is important to notice here that without loss of generality one can take the states @xmath17 and @xmath22 corresponding to unitaries @xmath0 and @xmath23 in eq .   to be either proportional or orthogonal",
    "indeed , since the linear span @xmath24 of maps",
    "@xmath25 is a finite dimensional space , and the circuit in eq .",
    "acts linearly on maps @xmath25 , also the span of the states @xmath26 is finite dimensional , with a dimension bounded by @xmath27 .",
    "now , for every pair of unitaries @xmath0 and @xmath23 , the amount of information provided by the circuit in eq",
    ".   is a decreasing function of @xmath28 .",
    "suppose that for a given pair @xmath29 the circuit providing maximum information about the pair @xmath29 has @xmath30 .",
    "then by applying the same circuit twice one has @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , while using an ancillary system having the same dimension as the initial one .",
    "this implies that the hypothesis of optimality of @xmath33 is absurd .",
    "one must then have either @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "the argument can be repeated for every pair @xmath29 .",
    "this observation motivates the following definition .",
    "[ def : markableset ] let @xmath19 be a set of unitaries , and let @xmath36 be a partition of @xmath19 .",

    "however , this distinction is not substantial : if @xmath19 is a set of representatives of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is @xmath37-markable , then any other set @xmath44 of representatives of @xmath18 is @xmath37-markable .",
    "it is worth making some easy considerations : i ) a _ necessary _ condition for @xmath19 to be @xmath37-markable is that any @xmath45 is perfectly discriminable from any @xmath46 , and ii ) a _ sufficient _ condition for @xmath19 to be @xmath37-markable is that @xmath18 is made of unitaries that are jointly perfectly discriminable ( in this case @xmath18 is @xmath37-markable for any partition @xmath37 ) .",
    "as we will prove later , none of these conditions is both necessary and sufficient .",
    "as proved in the methods section , another simple , yet important , property is the following one .",
    "[ lmm : minpart ] for any set @xmath19 of unitaries , there exists a unique _ minimal _ partition @xmath37 such that @xmath19 is @xmath37-markable and @xmath19 is not @xmath47-markable for any refinement @xmath47 of @xmath37 .    a relevant feature of the information - disturbance problem in eq .",
    "is that information about the unknown @xmath0 is available only _ after _",
    "@xmath0 has been applied to the input state .",
    "a more restrictive scenario is the one in which the outcome of the estimation is available _ before _ we apply the unitary and it is described by the circuit @xmath48 where the index @xmath40 labels the element of a partition of a set of unitaries and @xmath49 .",

    "in this work we explored under what conditions can a set of quantum conditional statements be implemented .",
    "we derived a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of quantum gates to be controllable along with a complete characterization of the controllable sets of qubit unitaries .",
    "these results show an intimate relation between controllability and the task of marking the unitaries , i.e. classifying them while applying them to an unknown input state .",
    "we completely solved the markability problem for two - dimensional unitaries through the circuit of eq .  , which could be considered for experimental implementation using e.g.  the technology of ref .",
    "the problem of finding general markability conditions in higher dimension remains open .",
    "let us consider four finite dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath85 , @xmath86 with dimensions @xmath87 .",
    "any map that transforms an input channel @xmath88 into an output channel @xmath89 can be realized by inserting the input channel into a quantum circuit board as follows : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is an ancillary hilbert space and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are quantum channels .",
    "this result , along with many other properties of quantum circuit boards , is well known and is the subject of many publications ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular it is known that any quantum circuit board , as in eq .  , corresponds to a positive operator ( called _ quantum comb _ ) @xmath94 subject to linear constraints .",
    "obviously , as far as the hilbert spaces @xmath95 are finite dimensional , the set of all the admissible quantum circuit board is a compact set .    also , the quantum channels which realize the quantum circuit board can be dilated to unitary channels acting on a larger hilbert space @xmath96 whose dimension @xmath97 satisfies @xmath98 .",
    "then , for each quantum circuit board as in eq .  , there exist two unitary operators @xmath99 , @xmath100 such that @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath7 denotes the trace on @xmath103 ."
