    "we consider spin models on locally finite trees @xmath4 where the spin variables @xmath5 , take values in the finite local state space @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction between the spin variables will be given by a transfer matrix which is circulant , i.e. possesses discrete rotation - invariance , and which can therefore be uniquely described by its eigenvalues .",
    "an interesting question is whether or not there exists more than one extremal gibbs measure , i.e. , if there is a phase transition for this model .",
    "a little bit more involved is the question if it is possible to identify precise values for the free parameters of the transfer matrix at which a phase transition occurs . for background and recent results",
    "see @xcite . +",
    "another interest in spin models on trees comes from network theory , where random graphs are used to describe the interaction between different agents . in these models",
    "the random graphs are often assumed ( or proven in the large - graph limit ) to be locally tree - like . to understand the behavior of these systems it is important to understand the situation on the tree first @xcite .    for the ising model on an arbitrary infinite tree with constant interaction strength @xmath8 the exact critical inverse temperature @xmath9 of phase transition is well - known and is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath12 is the _ branching number _ of the tree which captures the average number of edges per vertex @xcite .",
    "similarly , the critical value for the existence of infinite clusters under independent bernoulli percolation and the critical value for recurrence of random walks on the tree are given in terms of @xmath12 as well @xcite .",
    "one way to determine whether or not the spin model exhibits a phase transition is to exploit the recursion formula for the marginal distributions of the finite - volume gibbs measures under boundary condition , see . for such models",
    "there is no phase transition , if and only if all the single - site marginals of the finite - volume gibbs measures converge to the equidistribution for every boundary condition @xmath13 ( proposition [ pro : rep ] ) .",
    "for some models which are stochastically increasing in the boundary condition , in a sense described below , it is even enough to prove that the marginals of the finite - volume gibbs measure under _ plus boundary condition _",
    "converge to the equidistribution .",
    "this is for example the case in the ising and the continuous rotator model , but also in the _ generalized clock model _ which will be introduced shortly ( proposition [ pro : plus ] ) .    showing that the gibbs marginals converge under the tree recursion",
    "is in general a challenging problem : along the leaves of the finite subtree we have to fix a boundary condition , which means that we are starting from a dirac distribution , i.e. , far away from the equidistribution , and the recursion , in general , lacks any convexity .    in @xcite pemantle and steif introduced the notion of a _ robust phase transition _ ( or rpt ) which makes the tree recursion for the gibbs marginals easier to analyze .",
    "such a robust phase transition is said to occur when even for an arbitrary weakening of the interaction along the spins at the boundary of a sequence of finite sub - volumes @xmath14 , we still retain information about the spins at a single site in the thermodynamic limit @xmath15 , i.e. , even under this stronger condition the single - site gibbs marginals are not converging to the equidistribution . for more background on phase - transitions in systems with weak boundary couplings see also @xcite . the question whether or not there is a _ robust _ phase transition is easier to answer as",
    "one can make use of local arguments around the equidistribution . to be more specific : under the assumption that there is a robust phase transition it is possible to start the recursion in a distribution which is already arbitrarily close to the equidistribution .",
    "then , we only have to make sure that under the recursion we are repelled from the equidistribution .",
    "the behavior is heuristically understood in terms of the linearization of the recursion , but to control the non - linearities along relevant directions is delicate .",
    "pemantle and steif provided a sharp threshold for the existence of a rpt for the continuous rotator model ( also called classical heisenberg model ) in any dimension , as well as for the potts model .",
    "similarly to the threshold for _ regular _ phase transitions in the ising model , it is given in terms of the branching number of the tree and an effective coupling parameter , which turns out to be the second eigenvalue of the transfer operator .",
    "furthermore they showed that for the potts model rpt occurs at a different threshold than the regular phase transition , but conjectured that rpt and regular phase transition should occur at the same threshold in the continuous heisenberg models @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate generalized clock models as interpolations between the potts model and the model of plane rotators ( xy - model , heisenberg model on @xmath2 ) , from the perspective of the study of rpts .",
    "( for more results around the issue of differences and similarities between continuous spin - models and clock models see e.g. @xcite . )",
    "this paper consists of two main parts : + _ applicability of pemantle - steif theory _ : + we consider a class of finite - state spin models on general trees and show that for a wide range of circulant transfer matrices the sharp threshold for the existence of rpt given by pemantle and steif holds in these cases as well ( proposition [ pro : rpt ] ) .",
    "more precisely , this result holds under the assumption that the matrix elements of the transfer matrix are non - increasing in the distance to the diagonal .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the pair potential describing the interaction of two neighboring spins along the tree is non - decreasing in the difference of the spin values along the discrete circle .",
    "+ _ bifurcation analysis on binary tree for @xmath16 _",
    ": + for @xmath16 we show that in these models , which we call _ generalized clock models _ , rpt and regular phase transition are in general not equivalent and we determine the transition point between both scenarios in terms of the third eigenvalue of the corresponding transfer operator for two examples on the binary tree ( theorem [ thm : rpt45 ] ) .",
    "for a visualization of the regions of the different regimes see figures [ ptvsrpt ] , [ ptvsrptq5 ] in section 4 . in the standard clock model with cosine - potential",
    "it turns out that there are no non - robust phase transitions ( unlike @xmath17 ) .",
    "+ the non - equivalence is shown by studying the tree recursion on the level of the fourier coefficients @xmath18 of the marginal distributions of the finite - volume gibbs measures . this leads us to a two - dimensional fixed - point equation which turns out to be polynomial .",
