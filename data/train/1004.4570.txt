    "the high temperature superconductivity in the newly discovered oxypnictides , lnfeaso ( ln = la , pr , ce , sm ) , has attracted great attention aiming to identify the mechanism of superconductivity in these materials@xcite .",
    "recently the transition temperature @xmath2 is dramatically raised from @xmath3 to @xmath4@xcite .",
    "in addition to the high @xmath2 , these materials display many other interesting properties .",
    "the most interesting phenomena is the presence of competition between the magnetically ordered ground states@xcite of spin density wave(sdw ) and superconductivity , but a controversy model explains the superconductivity by means of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in lafeaso@xcite .",
    "pure oxypnictide is not superconducting but shows an anomaly at about @xmath5 in both resistivity and dc magnetic susceptibility@xcite .",
    "both experimental and theoretical evidences show that the anomaly is caused by the sdw instability@xcite .",
    "it is shown by the first principle calculations that the band structure of lnfeaso near the fermi surface ( fs ) is formed by a hole - like pocket centered around the @xmath1 point and an electron - like pocket around the m point in the extended brillouin zone(bz)(one fe atom per unit cell)@xcite . a strong fs nesting effect exists between the hole and electron pockets with commensurate wave vectors , @xmath6 and its symmetric ones .",
    "this leads to a strong sdw instability , and is believed to cause the the anomaly at @xmath5 .",
    "raghu _ et al _ calculated the sdw in the iron oxypnictides within a minimal two - band model in the phase random approximation(rpa ) .",
    "they found that the sdw is enhanced significantly by the intra - band coulomb repulsion .",
    "the influence of the inter - band coulomb interaction and the hund s coupling , however , have not yet been fully studied in literatures .",
    "different researchers select different groups of interaction parameters , but the relation between them has not been revealed .",
    "in addition , the temperature dependence of the sdw has hardly been theoretically considered . as pointed out by lee and wen@xcite",
    ", a three - band model reproduces more accurately the band structure near the fermi surface of oxypnictides . in this work",
    "we study the sdw in a three - band model in the rpa and the temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility . the magnetic instability is studied for a wide range of interaction parameters .",
    "we found a new resonance of the spin susceptibility around the @xmath1 point at higher temperatures , indicating the formation of a paramagnetic phase .",
    "there appears a transition from the sdw phase to the paramagnetic phase when temperature increases .",

    "the density of states is significantly different from the two - band model , of which the van hove singularities are more distant from the fermi level .",
    "a stronger nesting effect is expected in this three - band model .",
    "the third band is mixed with the two conventional bands and thus should have great contribution to the spin susceptibility .",
    "the static spin susceptibility in the non - interacting case is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 where @xmath26 are band indexes , @xmath27 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors respectively of the hamiltonian matrix ( [ mk ] ) .",
    "we fix @xmath31 for a finite lattice with 64 @xmath32 64 @xmath33 meshes in the extended bz to calculate the static spin susceptibility , which is shown in fig.3(upper ) .",
    "the static spin susceptibility shows great peaks at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this indicates that a collinearly - striped antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order phase , a spin density wave ( sdw ) , exhibits in oxypnictide .",
    "this feature is in agreement with the neutron scattering measurements@xcite .",
    "the sdw comes from the strong nesting between the hole pocket at the @xmath1 point and the electron pocket at the m point in the extended bz .",
    "it is observed experimentally that this sdw peak is significantly suppressed by f doping@xcite .",
    "this is reasonable because a down - shift of the fermi level tends to reduce the size of electron pocket and enlarge the hole pocket thus to suppress the nesting between them .",

    "the parameters on the contour lines labeled by `` @xmath52 '' in these two diagrams give zero determinants thus lead to magnetic instabilities . for a fixed @xmath39",
    "the spin susceptibility decreases with increasing hund s coupling @xmath41 thus reduces the sdw peak at the m point .",
    "this result is quite different from that made by raghu _",
    "et al_@xcite , who found stronger spin fluctuations with increasing @xmath41 . the lower diagram in fig.3 shows the spin susceptibility close to the magnetic instability with @xmath53 , where the sdw peak is much enhanced due to the intraband coulomb repulsion relative to that of the bare spin susceptibility . when @xmath41 increases , however , the sdw peak drops significantly until the sdw phase fully disappears .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , when @xmath54 , a ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath55 ) is beneficial to the formation of the sdw on the m point . on the other hand",
    ", the charge - orbital instability appears in the region @xmath56 .",
    "that is , when a coulomb attraction exists between different bands a charge - orbital instability may occur .",
    "apart from this region the charge - orbital susceptibility also drops rapidly .",
    "it is worthy to notice that the charge - orbital susceptibility depends weakly on the value of @xmath39 , the intra - band repulsion , except for the case of very strong inter - band repulsion .",

    "it is found that at higher temperatures a new resonance appears at the @xmath1 point , which starts to increase rapidly at a temperature @xmath58 , as shown in fig.5 .",
    "this resonance corresponds to the formation of a paramagnetic phase in the material .",
    "the sdw peak at the m point drops to a nearly stable value at this temperature .",
    "this result is qualitatively in agreement with the experimental observation for the stripe - like afm phase in laofeas , which forms under a temperature 134k@xcite . at @xmath59",
    "the intensity of paramagnetic phase starts to surpass that of the striped afm phase .",
    "it is found that temperature changes hardly the bare spin susceptibility but smooths its distribution in the bz . reducing the intra - band coupling parameter @xmath39 , the relative intensity between the paramagnetic phase and the sdw phase reduces significantly .",
    "hence it is confirmed that this new resonance comes from the intra - band coupling .",
    "therefore , this temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility provides detailed information for the band structure of the oxypnictide material .",

    "et al _ found only eigenvalues 0.1 - 0.4 with the @xmath62wave symmetry@xcite .",
    "but yanagi _ et al _ claimed that some groups of interaction parameters give eigenvalue unity for this gap symmetry in the same material@xcite .",
