    "it is well established that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) drive winds of ionized gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the outflows of the low luminosity agn , the seyfert galaxies , are readily observed through their rich x - ray and uv spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) , in which blue - shifted absorption lines allow for elaborate plasma diagnostics of the photo - ionized wind ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "seyfert winds are typically flowing at low to moderate velocities of @xmath10 kms@xmath11 .",
    "although sensitivity and spectral resolution in the uv are superior to those in the x - rays , x - ray absorption spectra provide complete coverage of all ionization states , in contrast with uv absorption features which arise only from relatively low ionization gas .",
    "the underlying physical processes are absorption from inner atomic ( k- and l- ) shells at x - ray energies .",

    "an agn outflow is often crudely described in terms of several ionization and velocity components .",
    "uv spectra in particular typically resolve several outflow velocities ( @xcite ) , for the most part below 1000 kms@xmath11 .",
    "some x - ray spectra of seyferts also exhibit more than one velocity component ( @xcite ) .",
    "common practice , thus , is to fit spectra with absorbing components in which the outflow velocities @xmath18 and the ionization parameters @xmath16 are discrete parameters of the model .",
    "indeed , the literature includes models with distinct high and low ionization components , as well as discrete high and low velocities , which fit x - ray spectra of seyfert outflows fairly well ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , since in most cases the velocity range is small ( often unresolved in x - rays ) , while the range in ionization is huge , we find it worthwhile to think of discrete velocity components , each having an internal ionization structure .    in order to characterize the ionization structure of an outflow",
    ", @xcite defined an absorption measure distribution ( amd ) , which is the distribution of column density @xmath19 along the line of sight as a function of @xmath20 : @xmath21 reciprocally , the total column density @xmath22 can be expressed as an integral over the amd .",
    "the amd is the absorption analog of the emission measure distribution ( emd ) widely used in the analysis of emission - line spectra .",
    "it provides a more complete representation of the ionization distribution than that of the more commonly used models of several ionization components each with a fixed @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite highlighted that seyfert outflows exhibit a broad and flat amd , which is remarkably similar between different objects .",
    "a broad and flat ionization distribution is also suggested by the x - ray emission line spectrum of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  1068 , as analyzed by @xcite ( 2002 , fig .  9 therein ) and @xcite ( 2014 , fig .  11 therein ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the broad amd could either be due to a large - scale density profile in the flow of @xmath23 , such as in the mhd winds of @xcite , or alternatively , the broad amd could be due to steep density gradients @xmath24 inside a well - localized flow ( e.g. , cloud , where @xmath25 is the depth into the cloud ) . the most common interpretation of the outflow as a localized flow is the ` thermal instability ' model ( @xcite and citations thereafter ) . in this model ,",
    "the gas pressure @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the gas temperature ) is such that a stable thermal equilibrium solution can be reached with more than one value of @xmath28 .",
    "the different solutions , or ` phases ' , are assumed to co - exist in pressure equilibrium , each with its own @xmath28 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , as we show below , the values of @xmath16 observed in seyfert outflows imply that the radiation pressure of the incident radiation @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) includes only the directed pressure of the incident agn radiation , without any contribution from radiation which is emitted by the gas .",
    "also , the value of @xmath29 equals the radiation pressure at the illuminated surface , before any absorption or scattering .",
    "] is much larger than @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , if the gas is not accelerating , the slab must develop a gradient in @xmath26 to counteract the force of radiation , in contrast with the uniform @xmath26 assumed by the ` thermal instability ' model .",
    "this gas pressure gradient implies a sharp density gradient within a single localized slab .",
    "this local density gradient is inevitable , and is a general property of photoionized gas .",
    "this hydrostatic compressing effect of radiation pressure has been incorporated in the seyfert outflow models of @xcite and @xcite , in models of  gas in star - forming regions ( @xcite ) , and in models of agn emission line clouds by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( 2014 , hereafter paper i ) and @xcite ( 2014 , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and papers i and ii showed that a slab compressed by radiation pressure indeed spans a very broad range of ionization states , as commonly observed in seyfert outflows .    in this paper",
    ", we further show that radiation pressure compression produces a universal amd , which is only weakly dependent on model parameters , and is insensitive to the uncertainties in radiation transfer calculations .",
    "we show that the predicted amd is consistent with the observed amd , and explains the small dispersion of the amd between different objects .",
    "we emphasize that we do not attempt to produce a full kinematic model of seyfert outflows , but rather show that independent of the exact kinematic model , the amd has a universal shape . in the next paper in this series ( baskin et al . , in prep .",
    ", hereafter paper iv ) , we apply radiation pressure compression also to broad absorption line quasars .",
    "the paper is built as follows . in section 2",
    ", we derive the amd implied by radiation pressure compression , both by analytic approximation and by using full numerical radiative transfer calculations . in section 3",
    "we compare the derived amd with available observations of seyfert outflows .",
    "we discuss our results and their implications in section 4 , and conclude in section 5 .",
    "assume a body of gas , irradiated by an ionizing source far enough relative to its size so that the incoming radiation is plane - parallel .",
    "additionally , assume that any processes on the dimensions perpendicular to the radiation have long enough timescales so that they can be disregarded , and the analysis can be done in one dimension .",
    "also , assume that the gas can be treated as hydrostatic in its rest - frame , i.e. it is not significantly accelerated by the radiation .",
    "now , if radiation is the dominant force applied to the gas in its rest frame , then the hydrostatic equation takes the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the flux of the ionizing radiation ( @xmath33 ) at a certain depth @xmath25 , and @xmath34 is the spectrum - averaged radiation pressure cross section per h - nucleon @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the flux density , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the absorption and electron scattering cross - section per h - nucleon , respectively . in the definition of @xmath34 we have disregarded a correction factor due to anisotropic scattering ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which is of order unity .",
    "this simplification facilitates the use of @xmath34 also in the definition of the flux - averaged optical depth : @xmath39 using the definitions of @xmath40 and @xmath29 ( @xmath41 ) , we can replace @xmath42 in eq .",

    "therefore , the hydrostatic equation obtains the simple form @xmath44 with the solution @xmath45 where a subscript @xmath46 denotes the value of a quantity at the illuminated surface .",
    "[ eq : hydrostatic only radiation ] neglects non - thermal sources of isotropic pressure , such as magnetic pressure @xmath47 and the pressure of the trapped line emission @xmath48 above . ] .",
    "these terms are assumed to be small compared to @xmath26 .",
    "we address the effect of relaxing this assumption in the appendix . also , the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : hydrostatic only radiation ] should include a correction factor due to the pressure induced by non - ionizing photons .",

    "[ eq : hydrostatic only radiation ] as is .",
    "this correction factor , and the effect of anisotropic scattering , are incorporated in the numerical calculations below .",
    "we define a slab as radiation pressure compressed ( rpc ) , if @xmath26 increases significantly throughout the slab , i.e. @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the total optical depth of the slab . equation [ eq : hydro solution ] shows that @xmath51 is a necessary condition for rpc .",
    "how does this condition relate to the ionization state of the gas ? using the definition of @xmath16 ( eq . [ eq : xi ] ) , the condition @xmath52 is equivalent to @xmath53 where for mathematical brevity",

    "cloudy  divides the slab into ` zones ' , and solves the local thermal equilibrium and local ionization equilibrium equations for a given @xmath26 in each zone , where each consecutive zone is subject to the attenuated radiation from the previous zone .",

    "[ eq : xi ] .",

    "another possibility is that dusty gas with @xmath284 resides in a distinct absorbing component on the host galaxy scale , where @xmath14 is large enough so that @xmath277 is too long for efficient grain destruction .",
    "the rpc solution is valid for a non - accelerating outflow .",
    "what then counteracts the outward force of the radiation @xmath29 ?",

    "note that if @xmath293 , then the ambient medium is fully ionized , and will not be observable .",
    "a remaining open question is the stability of a radiation compressed outflow .",
    "this subject was addressed in studies for various configurations related to agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "a possibly significant instability source is rayleigh - taylor instability , which occurs when the density gradient and the acceleration are in opposite directions .",
    "if the outflow is accelerated outwards by the radiation pressure , and part of this radiation is balanced by the built up gas pressure ( i.e. the hydrostatic rpc solution ) , then the lower density gas lies `` above '' the higher density outflowing gas , and the flow should be rayleigh - taylor stable ( see , e.g. , the analysis by @xcite on the interaction of radiation pressure with accreting gas in massive stars ) . however , as mentioned above , the outflowing gas is likely plowing into a low density ambient medium , and thus the leading face of this outflow forms a dense medium above a low density medium , which is expected to be rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "the timescale for the development of this instability , and its effect on the outflow require numerical simulations which can follow the growth of the instability beyond the linear growth phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "this rayleigh - taylor instability may be relevant for understanding the velocity dispersion in the outflows .",
    "the rpc solutions correspond to gas outflowing at a constant velocity , which will produce only thermal broadening of the absorbing gas , while typically agn outflows feature super - thermal broadening ( see also app .",
    "[ app : pline ] ) .",
    "the instability may induce a supersonic large scale turbulence at the leading edge of the outflow , which would broaden the lines beyond the thermal width .",
    "numerical simulations can be used to test this possible mechanism .",
    "the rpc outflow is convectively stable , as hot low - pressure gas overlies dense high - pressure gas , while convective instability requires a negative slope of the entropy with pressure .",
    "the outflowing gas is also kelvin - helmholtz unstable to the shear against the ambient gas in its lateral boundaries .",
    "this instability is relevant to any mechanism which drives outflowing filaments of gas .",
    "again , a quantitative estimate of the impact of this instability requires detailed numerical simulations .",
    "one long - sought property of agn outflows is their mass outflow rate @xmath294 , which can determine the extent of feedback exerted by the agn on its host galaxy , a mechanism often employed in structure formation models ( e.g. @xcite ) . in order to evaluate @xmath294",
    ", one needs an estimate of @xmath14 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the insensitivity of the amd to @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : amd vs params ] ) indicates that the amd is not directly useful to constrain @xmath14 , and therefore the typical values of @xmath294 remain an open question .",
    "standard fitting models , e.g. , xstar  models in xspec , for the sake of simplicity use iso-@xmath16 components  the opposite of the broad distribution implied by rpc . since for practical purposes",
    "any continuous distribution can be approximated by a discrete set of components , it is advisable to use these models by invoking a series of well defined ionization components that span the ionization range of @xmath17 expected from rpc .",
    "since each ion forms over a range of @xmath16 , there is an empirical limit to the amd resolution ( in @xmath16 ) that one can expect to achieve from fitting spectra .",
    "usually , @xmath295 ionization components are sufficient to cover the observed range of ionization states , and using many more would only result in a degeneracy between adjacent components .",
    "even when fewer than four components achieve a statistically reasonable fit to the spectra in terms , say , of reduced @xmath296 , the present work shows that a continuous distribution provides a more physically meaningful picture of the outflow structure .",
    "additionally , by using several components , observers can recover the full amd including its possible gaps ( instabilities ) , which the statistically based trial - and - error fitting approach of adding iso-@xmath16 components is obviously not able to recover .",
    "the number of free parameters can be reduced by using an analytic power - law fit for the amd , which has four free parameters ( minimum @xmath16 , maximum @xmath16 , slope , and normalization ) , compared to @xmath297 free parameters needed to fit @xmath295 individual clouds ( @xmath16 and @xmath66 for each ) .",
    "we re - iterate from @xcite that the amd insight into the outflow structure was inspired by a similar approach commonly used in the analysis of astrophysical plasma ( emission ) sources starting from the sun ( @xcite ) , through stellar coronae ( @xcite ) , and all the way to cooling flow models of galaxy clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "ionization distributions , are thus a tool to understand the physics of the plasma at hand more than they are an empirically fitting method .",
    "the ionization levels of agn outflows imply that @xmath263 . since the transfer of energy from the radiation to the gas",
    "is always associated with a transfer of momentum , the radiation will either compress or accelerate the absorbing gas .",
    "we solve the hydrostatic slab structure of radiation pressure compressed ( rpc ) gas both analytically and numerically .",
    "we show that a single slab of rpc gas produces a typical density profile of @xmath24 inside the slab , and spans a wide range of ionization states , as found previously by @xcite .",
    "additionally , we find that :    1 .",
    "rpc predicts a robust normalization and slope of the absorption measure distribution : @xmath298 .",
    "2 .   the normalization and slope of the amd are independent of @xmath22 , @xmath163 , and @xmath14 , and only weakly depend on @xmath72 and @xmath75 .",
    "3 .   the theoretical slope agrees with observations of agn outflows with @xmath18 of a few @xmath299 , while the normalization is smaller by a factor of three , possibly due to atomic data uncertainties .",
