    "the scattering mechanism for anomalous transport near optimal doping in high t@xmath0 cuprates has been a long standing puzzle since the discovery of high t@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological description was proposed immediately , referred to as the marginal fermi - liquid ansatz , where the existence of critical fluctuations is essential @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nature of such critical excitations is suggested to be local , where dominant contributions for scattering with electrons result from their frequency dependence . as a result ,",
    "dynamics of electrons becomes incoherent , described by the local self - energy correction linearly proportional to frequency / temperature for its imaginary part .",
    "the relaxation rate can be identified with the scattering rate associated with transport because vertex corrections for relaxation of currents vanish automatically due to the locality of critical fluctuations .",
    "this explains the origin of the quasi - linear behavior of the electrical resistivity in temperature near the optimally doped high t@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "later , a microscopic description for the marginal fermi - liquid phenomenology was developed , called the circulating orbital - current model based on the three - band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "a standard description for such an incoherent fermi - liquid state is based on the spin - fluctuation model , strongly correlated fermi liquid being illustrated in the vicinity of an itinerant antiferromagnetic quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the low - energy physics of this effective field theory is not known even in the large-@xmath1 limit , where @xmath1 is the spin degeneracy and @xmath2 is the only expansion parameter @xcite . in spite of uncontrolled approximation ,",
    "the quasi-@xmath3-linear electrical resistivity was demonstrated , the results of which was in remarkable agreement with experimental data near optimal doping  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty of this fermi - liquid based approach is that the connection to an insulating - like state in the underdoped region is not clear .",
    "another popular approach is based on the slave - particle representation , where an electron field is assumed to be a composite operator given by a fermionic spinon field and a bosonic holon field , carrying spin and charge quantum numbers separatively  @xcite .",
    "the spin - charge separation scenario being followed , the anomalous transport property was explained in terms of the incoherent dynamics of holons , where the scattering mechanism for the incoherent dynamics is served from spin chirality fluctuations , described by gauge fluctuations in this effective field theory  @xcite .",
    "the spin - charge separated anomalous metallic state evolves into the fermi liquid phase via the condensation of holons which results in coherent electrons .",
    "an essential aspect is that this scenario is based on a paramagnetic mott insulating phase called a spin liquid state  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the evolution of electron dynamics from a mott insulator to a fermi liquid can be systematically described .",
    "however , the anderson - higgs mechanism gives rise to an artificial transition from the finite - temperature spin liquid to the fermi liquid instead of the crossover , which remains as an open issue .",
    "furthermore , the connection between the slave - particle approach and the spin - fluctuation scenario is also elusive near optimal doping .    in this study , we propose an alternative scenario to describe the marginal fermi - liquid phenomenology near optimal doping and to resolve the artificial finite - temperature transition to the fermi liquid .",
    "although the spin - charge separation is assumed in the underdoped region of high @xmath4 cuprates  @xcite , spinons and holons are conjectured to be confined around the optimal doping region . based on this confinement ansatz , we reproduce the experimental data for the electrical transport  @xcite , which implies that the confinment of the spinons and holons may play an essential role in dynamics of incoherent electrons .",
    "in addition to the non - fermi liquid physics via the polyakov - loop parameter , we realize the crossover instead of the second order transition , described by the coherence of such confined electrons .    the confinement of the spinons and holons will be described phenomenologically , the polyakov - loop parameter being introduced  @xcite to measure an effective fugacity of such fractionalized excitations .",
    "the polyakov - loop parameter becomes condensed to allow the deconfinement at high temperatures while it vanishes to cause the confinement at low temperatures .",
    "the crossover from the marginal fermi liquid to the fermi liquid is conjectured to occur below the confinement - deconfinement crossover temperature . in this paper",
    "we do not discuss how the spin liquid state in the underdoped region evolves into the fermi liquid phase in the overdoped region , leaving it for more serious future investigations beyond this study .",
    "the nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl ) has been successfully used as an effective model for nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in explaining low - energy phenomena such as properties of hadrons , since it describes successfully the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath5s )  @xcite .",
    "the model consists of only quark degrees of freedom , the gluons being being integrated out , for example , via instantons  @xcite .",
    "while the njl model explains certain aspects of the qcd vacuum and spectra of lowest - lying hadrons , it does not contain any feature of the confinement .",
    "one of the simplest ways to bring this confinement back into this framework is to introduce an additional temporal static gluon field , which can be coupled to quarks .",
    "this effective model is called the polyakov extended njl model ( pnjl )  @xcite .",
    "the thermally averaged polyakov loop can be taken as an order parameter for deconfinement in the limit of the heavy - quark mass . in this case , the crossover of confinement - deconfinement is featured by the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath6 center symmetry with the number of color @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the dynamical quark breaks explicitly this symmetry , so that the polyakov loop is no more order parameter .",
    "however , it was shown that the polyakov loop describes a rapid crossover in the vicinity of the critical point of the deconfinement phase , which indicates that we still can consider the polyakov loop as a signature for the deconfinement .",
    "the results of various susceptibilities from the pnjl are known to be consistent with the lattice simulation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pnjl scheme has been employed for the case of finite density of quarks  @xcite to study a generic phase diagram in quark matter .",
    "analogously , the pnjl will provide a good phenomenological framework for investigating the crossover from non - fermi liquid to fermi liquid .",
    "we point out the previous study in which the spinon - holon binding was introduced in the u(1 ) slave - boson approach  @xcite .",
    "although it is in line with the present work , the spinon - holon bound state is distinguished from the spinon - holon confined state : such a fractionalized particle is a well - defined excitation above the binding energy in the previous study  @xcite , while it is unstable for all energy scales due to the presence of the polyakov - loop parameter in our formulation .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly review the pnjl model in the context of an su(2 ) gauge theory of the t - j model . in section iii",
    ", we describe the coherent crossover from non - fermi liquid to fermi liquid with the effects of the confinement considered via the polyakov - loop parameter .",
    "we present the results of the electrical resistivity which shows the crossover at low temperatures .",
    "the final section is devoted the summary and discussion of the present results .",
    "we start from the t - j model for doped mott insulators @xmath8 where hopping of electrons is allowed only when the site for hopping is empty .",
    "this constraint raises an important problem for the quantization because the electron operator with it does not satisfy the anti - commutation relation .",
    "one way to avoid this problem is to write an electron field as a composite operator @xmath9 where the holon and spinon fields are expressed , respectively , as @xmath10 @xmath11 is an antisymmetric tensor , i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "the matrix of the order parameter can be written as @xmath20 which comes from the standard bosonization procedure for interactions , where the spin - singlet interaction channel of the j - term is decomposed into particle - hole exchange hopping and particle - particle d - wave pairing scattering channels .",

    "the fermi liquid state appears from the sm phase , given by the condensation of holons @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which results from the change of the chemical potential @xmath34 .",

    "the spinons interact with the holons via su(2 ) gauge fluctuations .",
    "such gauge interactions have been proposed as the source for the anomalous transport in the sm phase  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not enough to treat gauge fluctuations perturbatively in order to simulate the gutzwiller projection  @xcite .",
    "moreover , such an approach based on the deconfinement can not recover electron excitations at low temperatures without the anderson - higgs mechanism , which means that the fermi liquid phase is never obtained without the artificial transition .",
    "thus , we propose in the present work one possible way of describing the crossover from the sm to the fermi liquid around the optimal doping , based on the confinement - deconfinement feature .      we write down the covariant derivative as @xmath44 where @xmath45 corresponds to a nontrivial vacuum contribution , nothing but",

    "introducing non - local interactions will improve the qualitative picture more quantitatively .",

    "the local current - current interactions are expected to be irrelevant in the renormalization group sense , so that they will be neglected for simplicity . using the following identity @xmath55 , we write down the isospin interaction term as @xmath56 where the local interactions of the holons are absorbed into the usual @xmath57 term called self - interactions .    the spinon - exchange interaction , i.e. , the first term of eq .

    "[ fig3 ] , the results are in remarkable agreement with the experimental data , which supports our confinement scenario . in addition , the @xmath121 behavior is clearly observed at low temperatures , confirming our statement that the crossover from the sm phase to the fermi liquid state is described by the coherence effect with the confinement .",
    "in the present study we proposed a novel mechanism for the marginal fermi - liquid phenomenology near optimal doping in high @xmath4 cuprates . first , we tried to resolve the artificial finite - temperature second - order transition from a spinon - holon deconfined non - fermi liquid state ( or a finite - temperature spin - liquid state ) to a spinon - holon higgs - confined fermi - liquid phase .",
    "indeed , we made the continuous transition smoothen into the crossover , but from a spinon - holon confined incoherent fermi - liquid state to a spinon - holon confined coherent fermi - liquid phase .",
    "the confinement of spinons and holons at finite temperatures was phenomenologically described by the polyakov - loop parameter , where confined spinon - holon composite particles are identified with incoherent electrons in the temperature - regime above the `` holon '' chemical potential .",
    "although holons are not elementary excitations due to confinement , given by the huge imaginary part from the polyakov - loop parameter , their chemical potential defines the coherence energy scale .",
    "the second point , which is more important in our opinion , is that we proposed one possible mechanism for the non - fermi liquid resistivity near the optimal doping , introducing the polyakov - loop parameter .",
    "this object gives rise to not only confinement but also an interesting self - energy correction to such confined spinons , where the imaginary part of the spinon self - energy is proportional to temperature , regarded as the signature of confinement .",
    "this anomalous dynamics affects dynamics of incoherent electrons , responsible for the non - fermi liquid resistivity above the fermi - liquid coherence temperature near the optimal doping .",
    "we believe that this is a novel mechanism for the non - fermi liquid transport around the optimal doping in high @xmath122 cuprates . in order to realize such non - fermi liquid physics ,",
    "we usually resort to some type of critical fluctuations , which can give rise to the t - linear self - energy correction .",
    "recall the marginal fermi - liquid ansatz . in this study",
    "we do not assume any kinds of symmetry breaking for the scattering mechanism .",
    "the polyakov - loop parameter serves a novel scattering mechanism for the marginal fermi - liquid physics near the optimal doping .",
    "in fact , we can not justify the fundamental reason why the polyakov - loop parameter should be utilized near optimal doping .",
    "our formulation is based on a spin liquid state , expected to apply to an underdoped paramagnetic insulating - like state ( at least applicable to finite temperatures , usually referred to as the proximity effect of the spin liquid physics ) , where spinons and holons appear as elementary excitations . although we can not explain how such deconfined particles evolve into confined electrons as a function of hole concentration , we believe that these deconfined excitations should be confined around the optimal doping region above the pseudogap phase , where the anomalous @xmath3-linear - like resistivity is shown . an important question is how to construct incoherent electrons from spinons and holons at finite temperatures .",
    "one can introduce a spinon - holon bound state based on the ladder - type t - matrix approximation without the polyakov - loop parameter .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this construction allows the non - fermi liquid resistivity or not .",
    "we would like to emphasize again that the polyakov - loop parameter can solve two problems at the same time , confinement ( conceptually valid ) and non - fermi liquid ( marginal fermi liquid ) physics near the optimal doping .",
    "if one insists that deconfinement should be stabilized due to the fermi surface @xcite and the confined fermi liquid state results from the anderson - higgs mechanism , we would like to point out that the existence argument can be justified in the large-@xmath1 limit , where @xmath1 is the number of degeneracy in fermion flavors .",
    "if we consider a realistic situation at finite @xmath1 , several types of missing correlations may play an important role for fermion dynamics , where enhanced correlations will reduce conductivity , which means that such fermions can have difficulty in screening gauge interactions .",
    "it is natural to expect that fermions in an almost insulating state will not screen gauge forces appropriately , even if they form their fermi surface @xcite . although we can not give any definite statement on confinement in the presence of the fermi surface , we believe that there is no consensus , in particular , when finite @xmath1 should be considered @xcite .",
    "what we can argue here is that our confinement formulation based on the polyakov - loop parameter turns the artificial second - order transition into the crossover , conceptually more advantageous than the holon condensation .",
    "one may suspect whether our fermi liquid state is the genuine fermi liquid phase or not because it is not obvious that the fermi surface of such coherent electrons satisfies the luttinger theorem @xcite .",
    "the main quantity is the chemical potential of electrons , emerging from confinement of spinons and holons .",
    "although this quantity should be and can be determined self - consistently in our formulation , we did not perform such a serious analysis",
    ". that analysis will involve many delicate issues , for example , a more accurate expression of the self - energy correction of electrons in order to determine the chemical potential accurately . in our study",
    "we just introduce the electron chemical potential phenomenologically , which can be determined to satisfy the luttinger theorem .",
    "this is the best at present in our formulation , which is another reason why we call our theory a phenomenological description .",
    "we would like to point out that the issue on the formation of incoherent electrons from deconfined spinons and holons is not seriously discussed in our study .",
    "incoherent electrons are assumed to exist at finite temperatures around the optimal doping region , resorting to the polyakov - loop parameter . of course , we pointed out that spinons and holons can be deconfined at high temperatures , showing that the polyakob - loop parameter is non - vanishing in the saddle - point approximation . in our mean - field analysis the change from the spinon - holon deconfined state to the confined incoherent fermi - liquid state ( by polyakov loop ) is naturally interpreted as the crossover at finite temperatures ( much higher than the non - fermi liquid to fermi liquid crossover temperature ) because there is no symmetry breaking , as discussed before .",
    "unfortunately , it does nt seem to be clear whether it is crossover or not beyond the mean - field analysis , which means to introduce quantum fluctuations for the polyakov - loop parameter @xcite .",
    "it is also an open question in our description how the polyakov - loop parameter evolves by hole doping .",
    "we believe that this requires some modifications of our present formulation .",
    "one may criticize cautiously the eliashberg approximation for neglecting the vertex corrections for self - energies .",
    "it has been recently clarified that two dimensional fermi surface is still strongly interacting even in the large-@xmath1 limit  @xcite , which implies that vertex corrections should be incorporated .",
    "an important question is raised as to whether these vertex corrections give rise to novel critical exponents beyond the eliashberg theory .",
    "several perturbative analysis demonstrated that although ladder - type vertex corrections do not change the critical exponents of the eliashberg theory , aslamasov - larkin corrections bring about modifications for such critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "if this is a general feature beyond this level of approximation , various quantum critical phenomena  @xcite should be reconsidered because the novel anomalous exponents in the fermion self - energy corrections are expected to affect various novel critical exponents for thermodynamics , transport , etc .",
    "however , considering our recent experiences in comparison with various experiments in heavy fermion quantum criticality , we want to emphasize that the critical exponents based on the eliashberg theory explain thermodynamics @xcite , both electrical and thermal transport coefficients @xcite , uniform spin susceptibility @xcite , and seebeck effect @xcite noticeably well .    recently , one of the authors investigated the role of the vertex corrections non - perturbatively , summing them to infinite order  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that particular vertex corrections given by ladder diagrams do not change eliashberg critical exponents at all @xcite , being consistent with the perturbative analysis .",
    "this was performed in a fully self - consistent way , the ward identity being utilized .",
    "in contrast with the previous perturbative analysis , the aslamasov - larkin corrections were shown not to modify the eliashberg dynamics  @xcite . in analogy with superconductivity , where the superconducting instability described by the aslamasov - larkin vertex corrections is reformulated by the anomalous self - energy in the eliashberg framework of the nambu spinor representation @xcite",
    ", we claimed that the off - diagonal self - energy associated with the 2@xmath123 particle - hole channel incorporates the same ( aslamasov - larkin ) class of quantum corrections in the nambu spinor representation .",
    "we evaluated an anomalous pairing self - energy in the nambu - eliashberg approximation , which vanishes at zero energy but displays the same power - law dependence for the frequency as the normal eliashberg self - energy . as a result , even the pairing self - energy corrections do not modify the eliashberg dynamics without the nambu spinor representation .",
    "we leave this profound and important issue for future investigations",
    ".    it will be of great interest to apply the pnjl scheme to the spin - liquid theory @xcite and kondo breakdown scenario @xcite for heavy fermions .",
    "in particular , the artificial finite - temperature transition would be resolved for the heavy fermion transition in the same way as the present case , which may allow a new scenario of quantum criticality .",

    "if we review recent studies @xcite on deconfinement in compact u(1 ) gauge theories critically , we can understand that the essential argument for the existence of the deconfinement state is based on interacting fixed points _ in the large-@xmath1 limit_.    ref .",
    "@xcite is on the compact u(1 ) gauge theory with dirac fermions .",
    "the authors assume the well - known conformally invariant fixed point of the non - compact qed@xmath154 ( two space and one time dimensional quantum electrodynamics ) in the large-@xmath1 limit , where vertex corrections can be neglected in the 1/@xmath1 expansion . however , we would like to point out that if we consider the case with finite @xmath1 , antiferromagnetic correlations , underestimated for the fixed point in the large-@xmath1 limit , will be enhanced .",
    "@xcite , where this issue was discussed in section ii - a .",
    "it is possible that essential properties of the interacting fixed point in the large-@xmath1 limit may be changed and this fixed point would become unstable toward a novel fixed point with more enhanced staggered - spin correlations .",
    "this is important because the dynamics of dirac fermions at the large-@xmath1 fixed point should be modified , which means that such fermions may have difficulty in screening gauge interactions .",
    "the fermi surface problem is more complicated .",
    "a recent study @xcite has claimed that the presence of abundant soft modes around the fermi surface will allow the deconfinement at least in the large-@xmath1 limit .",
    "although we think that this is certainly plausible , we would like to argue that it is difficult to claim its existence with confidence , in particular , at finite @xmath1 .",
    "first of all , 2k@xmath155 correlations should have been emphasized in the strange metal phase @xcite , certainly missed in this analysis .",
    "it is difficult to guarantee the deconfinement in the presence of 2k@xmath155 correlations because such correlations can reduce conductivity of spinons , expected to reduce the ability of screening for gauge interactions .",
    "actually , one of the authors revisited this problem , and claimed that the confinement - deconfinement transition was argued to take place , depending on the spinon conductivity @xcite .",

    "<S> marginal fermi - liquid physics near optimal doping in high t@xmath0 cuprates has been explained within two competing scenarios such as the spin - fluctuation theory based on an itinerant picture and the slave - particle approach based on a localized picture . in this study </S>",
    "<S> we propose an alternative scenario for the anomalous transport within the context of the slave - particle approach . </S>",
    "<S> although the marginal fermi - liquid phenomenology was interpreted previously within deconfinement of the compact gauge theory , referred to as the strange metal phase , we start from confinement , introducing the polyakov - loop parameter into an su(2 ) gauge theory formulation of the t - j model . </S>",
    "<S> the polyakov - loop parameter gives rise to incoherent electrons through the confinement of spinons and holons , which result from huge imaginary parts of self - energy corrections for spinons and holons . </S>",
    "<S> this confinement scenario serves a novel mechanism for the marginal fermi - liquid transport in the respect that the scattering source has nothing to do with symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the incoherent fermi - liquid state evolves into the fermi liquid phase through crossover instead of an artificial second - order transition as temperature is lowered , where the crossover phenomenon does not result from the anderson - higgs mechanism but originate from an energy scale in the holon sector . </S>",
    "<S> we fit an experimental data for the electrical resistivity around the optimal doping and find a reasonable match between our theory and the experiment . </S>"
