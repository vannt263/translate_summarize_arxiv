    "[ fig : statistics](c ) one can see two peaks of @xmath202 as a function of parameters @xmath203 .",
    "one of them corresponds to non - zero entanglement between the qubits and produces super - poisson statistics of work .",
    "the second peak is located at @xmath204 as indicated by the dotted black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : statistics](c ) . for such parameters",
    "the spectrum of effective rwa hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonianrwa ] ) is degenerate since the two levels coincide , @xmath205 .",
    "the subspace of eigenstates for this level is given by @xmath206 , where @xmath207 are arbitrary coefficients , and the orthogonal basis functions are @xmath208 and @xmath209 . to understand the nature of positive correlation @xmath202 , let us consider the case of small relaxation @xmath210 when the dm is diagonal @xmath211 .",
    "after the photon emission for example , by the first qubit the dm is projected to @xmath212 because the first qubit is bound to be in the ground state . taking the time average of the dm we find that during the subsequent evolution the first term produces a contribution @xmath213 with @xmath214 and @xmath215 so that in this case the amplitude of @xmath216 is asymmetric . at the same time",
    "the second term @xmath217 evolves into a symmetric time - averaged population of the qubits .",
    "that is the probability for the second qubit to be in the excited state and hence to emit a photon is larger than for the first one .",
    "thus the peak of @xmath202 is accompanied by the drop of the single channel fano factor as shown in fig .",

    "to conclude , we have developed a formalism of lindblad equation to calculate the statistics of energy fluctuations in dissipative quantum systems driven by an external force .",
    "we introduced generating functions of work and heat exchanged between the system , the classical driving source and the thermal bath which can be found by solving the lindblad equation .",
    "the general fluctuation relations are shown to be valid for the resulting work statistics . applying this formalism to the generic examples of a harmonic oscillator , a single and two coupled qubits",
    "we have shown that calorimetric measurements of heat statistics can indicate the presence of finite coherence and entanglement in the open quantum systems .",
    "it is our pleasure to thank prof .",
    "jukka pekola for discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the academy of finland , the european research council ( grant no .",

    "at zero temperature , it is possible to determine the long - time statistics @xmath218 of the total work @xmath0 by a measurement of the statistics @xmath219 of the heat dissipated to the environment @xmath2 .",
    "the measurement scheme is to drive the system only during the time interval @xmath220 , after which the system hamiltonian is made constant and to coincide with the initial state , @xmath221 for @xmath222 . in this case",
    ", the internal energy stored in the system is eventually emitted to the zero - temperature environment , @xcite and one finds @xmath223 .",
    "this correspondence can be proven directly using our master equation formulation .",
    "we start with the observation that for a given constant @xmath8 , we have at time @xmath222 , @xmath224 for the ground state density matrix @xmath225 . indeed , @xmath226 .",
    "therefore , @xmath227 is a steady state of the @xmath8-dependent time evolution for @xmath228 , and we find for @xmath229 , @xmath230 where @xmath231 is a scalar function .",
    "the initial state for @xmath232 is @xmath233 \\to e^{-iu\\epsilon_0}p_0 $ ] for @xmath228 , where @xmath234 is a ground state energy .",
    "it then immediately follows that for @xmath229 , @xmath235    =    f(u , t )    \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , we have for the dissipated work , for @xmath229 , @xmath236 therefore , in this measurement scheme we find @xmath237 , which is also the result one would expect based on physical arguments .",
    "note that above @xmath8 is taken as a @xmath1-independent constant while taking the limit @xmath228 .",
    "therefore , although we find that @xmath238 converges pointwise to @xmath232 , this does _ not _ imply that the dissipated work satisfies the jarzynski equality .",
    "indeed , while @xmath239 , the result above does not imply that @xmath240 .",
    "the lack of _ universal _ fluctuation relations for the heat @xmath2 can be easily demonstrated based on the master equation approach .",
    "this can be seen in the model of an non - driven qubit coupled to an environment .",
    "the corresponding liouvillian is @xmath241    +    \\gamma \\bigl ( e^{iu\\nu } \\hat{s } \\rho \\hat{s}^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\hat{s}^\\dagger\\hat{s},\\rho\\}\\bigr )    \\\\\\notag    & +    \\gamma e^{-\\beta\\nu } \\bigl ( e^{-iu\\nu } \\hat{s}^\\dagger \\rho \\hat{s } - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\hat{s}\\hat{s}^\\dagger,\\rho\\}\\bigr )    \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solving the time dependence of the @xmath8-dependent master equation , we find the generating function for the dissipated work @xmath242 this implies that the heat only obtains values @xmath243 , as can be expected based on the limited internal energy of the qubit .",
    "the above implies that the expectation value @xmath244 is time dependent .",
    "because this occurs at equilibrium with all hamiltonians time independent , there can be no fluctuation relation of the form @xmath245 where @xmath246 is a difference between two equilibrium free energies .",
    "this result is in agreement with the general non - equilibrium equality for the heat derived in ref . .",
