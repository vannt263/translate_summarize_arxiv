    "such comparisons show that the linear superposition between the ground states of cr@xmath2ni is quite smaller with respect to those can be possibly generated in high - spin nanomagnets , and remains farther from its theoretical maximum ( table [ tablefinal ] ) .",

    ".    an analogous conclusion can be drawn from the distinguishability of the two components @xmath305 through local measurements . the maximum number of subsystems into which the ring can be divided such that each subsystem carries the which - component information is in fact : @xmath306 in particular , any bipartition of the ring into groups of four spins allows one to achieve values of the probability @xmath307 , whereas this can be done with none of the partitions into a larger number of subsystems .

    "the v@xmath3 spin cluster consists of @xmath308 oxovanadium ions , each carrying an @xmath5 spin @xcite .",
    "the spins are arranged in three layers so as to form a triangle ( @xmath309 ) , sandwiched between two hexagons ( @xmath310 and @xmath311 ) .",
    "the spins that form each hexagon are coupled by a strong antiferromagnetic interaction , and are thus approximately frozen in a singlet state ( @xmath312 ) at low temperatures . besides , they mediate an effective interaction between the spins belonging to the triangle , described by the following spin hamiltonian : @xmath313 where @xmath314 . in this effective three - spin model ,",
    "the two states involved in the linear superposition @xmath21 differ only with respect to the component of the spin triangle : @xmath315 and @xmath316 both correspond to the singlet ground state of the hexagons , and @xmath317 are different eigenstates of @xmath318 . as a consequence , the expectation values of @xmath29 and",
    "@xmath319 take the following simplified forms : @xmath320 where the last expectation value accounts for the contribution from each of the two hexagons , and @xmath321 ( with @xmath322 ) .",
    "we first consider the linear superposition involving the two @xmath323 eigenstates of the spin triangle with @xmath324 eigenvalue of the spin chirality @xmath325 , that are coupled by a magnetic - dipole transition : @xmath326 in this case , the fluctuations of @xmath29 for the state @xmath21 are maximized by @xmath327 and by @xmath328 .",
    "the corresponding value of the variance , whose theoretical maximum is @xmath329 , is given by @xmath330 where the former contribution comes from the triangle and the latter one from the two hexagons @xcite .",
    "this results in the following sizes of the linear superposition @xmath21 : @xmath331    the two components @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not efficiently distinguishable by means of local measurements . in particular , the two hexagons carry no which - component information ( eq . [ v15 ] ) , and the two states @xmath332 of the spin triangle can only be distinguished with probability @xmath333 by considering all three spins .",
    "the size of linear superposition @xmath21 based on local measurements thus takes the same value that it would have for an individual @xmath5 spin : @xmath334    linear superpositions in the v@xmath3 molecule have also been generated in the @xmath335 excited quadruplet @xcite .",
    "hereafter we consider the case where the components coincide with the two maximally polarized eigenstates of @xmath318 , namely @xmath336 it is easily seen that the optimal operator @xmath337 coincides in this case with the spin projection along @xmath89 ( @xmath338 ) , while the expressions of the optimized @xmath339 and @xmath340 coincide with those reported above . due to the enhanced contribution from the spin triangle , the variance of @xmath29 increases to @xmath341 .",
    "correspondingly , the sizes of the linear superposition based on the fisher information become : @xmath342 finally , being the two states @xmath332 fully distinguishable at the single - spin level , the size of @xmath21 based on local measurement is : @xmath343 altogether , in spite of the large number of spins that form the v@xmath3 cluster , the sizes of the linear superpositions that can be generated within its lowest multiplets are either similar ( @xmath81 ) or identical ( @xmath151 ) to those of a simple spin triangle .",
    "this is due to the particular form of the low - energy eigenstates ( eq . [ v15 ] ) , where each hexagon is approximately frozen in a singlet state .",
    "the hexagons thus provide a sizeable contribution to the size based on the overall quantum fluctuations in the state @xmath21 , but not to the ones that depend on the quantum features resulting specifically from the linear superposition .",
    "resorting to different quantum - information theoretic measures , we have quantitatively investigated the size of linear superpositions that can be generated in different molecular nanomagnets ( table [ tablefinal ] ) .    amongst the high - spin systems , the sizes obtained for the spin - polarized ground states of mn@xmath0 and fe@xmath344 are of the order of the spin number @xmath17 @xcite , and thus comparable to those obtained in mesoscopic system @xcite .",
    "the considered measures can be maximized in ferrimagnetic systems by tuning the exchange couplings , such that the partial spin sum corresponding to each sublattice is maximal .",
    "this feature characterizes the ground state of an exchange hamiltonian in either of the two following cases : @xmath345 in an arbitrary geometry , if the coupling between two spins is either strongly ferromagnetic or weakly antiferromagnetic , depending on whether the two spins belong to the same sublattice or to different ones ; @xmath346 in the presence of antiferromagnetic couplings only , if the spin cluster is bipartite and the two sublattices are highly inequivalent ( as in the case of mn@xmath13 ) .",
    "the systems where the size of the linear superpositions are maximum , given the number and values of the constituent spins , are represented by those with ferromagnetic exchange interactions only ( mn@xmath213 ) .",
    "on the other hand , ferrimagnetic systems might allow the achievement of larger sizes if the constraint is on the value of @xmath287 instead ( consider , for example , the comparison between the cases of low - spin molecules and fe@xmath212 in table [ tablefinal ] , all with @xmath347 ) .",
    "we note that the difficulty of generating a linear superposition between ground states increases with the difference between their spin projections . the latter constraint might thus in practice more relevant than the former one .    in the case of low - spin nanomagnets",
    ", we address the question of to which extent the size of linear superposition is enhanced by the composite character of the molecule spin . here , we have considered two molecular spin clusters , namely cr@xmath2ni and v@xmath3 , characterized both by an @xmath4 ground state , but substantially different in terms of geometry , exchange pattern , and spin correlations . in both cases , the size of the linear superpositions between ground states is larger than those achievable with an individual @xmath5 spin , but not proportionate to the number and value of the constituent spins . in particular , the ground states of v@xmath3",
    "are poorly distinguishable by means of local measurements , due to the presence of spin subsensembles whose state is approximately frozen in the low - energy multiplets of the spin hamiltonian .",
    "the measures considered in the present paper can be usefully complemented by those based on different criteria , such as the fragility of the linear superposition with respect to decoherence @xcite",
    ". in particular , the correlation between such sizes and those derived from the fluctuations of single - spin operators or from local measurements might be significant if the environment couples locally to the electron spins .",
    "this seems to be the case with the nuclear - spin bath , which discriminates between @xmath19 and @xmath20 on the basis of the single - spin expectation values corresponding to the two components , rather than only on @xmath287 @xcite . a detailed understanding of the different decoherence mechanisms @xcite represents a preliminary requirement for exploring such connections further , and for generating macroscopic and yet robust linear superpositions in molecular nanomagnets @xcite .",
    "we finally comment on the possibility of estimating the size of linear superpositions in molecular nanomagnets by experimental means , and specifically by static measurements .",
    "the fluctuations of the @xmath29 operator can always be written as combinations of spin - pair correlation functions , which can be selectively accessed by inelastic neutron scattering . through this technique",
    ", one can thus quantify the size of a linear superposition @xmath348 , provided that this corresponds to the nondegenerate ground state of the system , and that the temperature is lower than the energy gap between ground and first - excited states . in the particular case of ferromagnetic systems ( @xmath215 ) ,",
    "the operator @xmath29 coincides with @xmath25 , and its fluctuations with the @xmath89 component of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the measure based on the distinguishability between two components can be indirectly estimated by chemically - selective techniques , such as nuclear magnetic resonance or x - ray magnetic circular dichroism .",
