    "active fluids are a novel class of nonequilibrium soft materials , which are composed of a large number of self - propelled particles suspended in simple fluids @xcite .",
    "the self - propelled particles can convert ambient or internal free energy into persistent motions with a direction depending on the local configuration of particles and interparticle interactions .",
    "suspensions of swimming microorganisms and synthetic colloidal swimmers are the most widely studied active fluids in experiments and frequently serve as models for theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "joint efforts of experiments , simulations , and theories have shown that active fluids exhibit surprising behaviors such as giant number fluctuations @xcite , ordered phases with collective particle motions @xcite , and abnormal rheology @xcite , unknown to conventional equilibrium complex fluids . among these features ,",
    "the enhanced diffusion of passive tracers in active fluids has attracted probably the most extensive and sustained interests in recent years .",
    "wu and libchaber first showed that a spherical tracer immersed in suspensions of swimming _ escherichia coli _ exhibits a superdiffusive motion at short times and an enhanced diffusion at long times @xcite .",
    "such an enhanced diffusion can be orders of magnitude stronger than the tracer s intrinsic brownian motion at high bacterial concentrations .",
    "following their pioneering work , the enhanced diffusion of passive spherical tracers has been reported and systematically studied in different active fluids including suspensions of swimming microorganisms such as prokaryotic cells _",
    "@xcite , _ bacillus subtilis _",
    "@xcite and _ pseudomonas sp . _ @xcite and eukaryotic cell _ chlamydomonas reinhardtii _ @xcite as well as synthetic colloidal microswimmers @xcite . the motion of passive tracers in active fluids is induced by the fluid flow of microswimmers in the far field and the direct steric interaction between tracers and microswimmers in the near field @xcite .",
    "thus , similar to microrheology in equilibrium systems @xcite , the study of the dynamics of passive tracers can reveal the intrinsic properties of active fluids .",
    "in addition , understanding the motion of passive tracers in suspensions of swimming microorganisms is also of biological relevance @xcite .",
    "the enhanced diffusion of passive particles such as nutrient granules , dead bacterial bodies , and liquid droplets of macromolecules boosts fluid mixing at microscopic scales @xcite , which helps to maintain an active ecological balance and promotes intercellular signaling and metabolite transport .",
    "although the dynamics of _ spherical _ passive tracers have been extensively studied @xcite , the motion of _ asymmetric _ tracers that possess degrees of freedom beyond simple translation has not been investigated until very recently .",
    "_ studied the dynamics of isolated ellipsoids in _ e. coli _ suspensions and showed that both the translational and rotational diffusion of ellipsoids are enhanced with increasing bacterial concentrations @xcite .",
    "more importantly , they found an abnormal anisotropic diffusion in the body frame of ellipsoids , where an ellipsoid diffuses fastest along its minor axis at high bacterial concentrations .",
    "such an abnormal anisotropic diffusion leads to a negative translation - rotation coupling in the laboratory frame that is strictly forbidden for brownian particles .",
    "based on a simple mean - field hydrodynamic calculation , they argued that the unusual anisotropic diffusion is a result of the universal straining flow created by pusher - type active particles with _ e. coli _ as one specific example .",
    "moreover , the calculation predicts that asymmetric tracers immersed in puller - type active fluids should show an opposite trend , where the diffusion of ellipsoids along the major axis should be more strongly enhanced .",
    "however , such a prediction has not been experimentally verified .",
    "depending on the forces exerted on the surrounding fluid , isolated self - propelled microswimmers can be generally categorized in two classes , i.e. , `` pushers '' and `` pullers '' @xcite . in the first order of a multipole expansion",
    ", a pusher creates a tensile dipole flow in the far field , where the fluid is pushed out parallel to the swimming direction of the swimmer and is pulled in at its midpoint perpendicular to the swimming direction ( fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) ) .",
    "in contrast , a puller creates a contractile dipole flow , where the fluid is pulled in parallel to the swimming direction and is pushed out at its midpoint ( fig .",

    "most bacteria including _",
    "e. coli _ and _ b. subtilis _ propel by rotating long thin flagella , which push fluid backward and , therefore , are pushers @xcite .",
    "algae such as _ c. reinhardtii _ propel by beating two anterior flagella that pull in fluid in the front and are well - known examples of pullers @xcite .",
    "although the two classes of active particles lead to profound differences in the behaviors of active fluids , such as their rheological response under shear @xcite and their stability in ordered swarming phases @xcite , the influences of pushers and pullers on the enhanced diffusion of spherical tracers are identical in the dilute limit @xcite . in both cases , the enhanced diffusion of passive tracers increases linearly with the active flux , defined as the product of the number density and the speed of microswimmers @xcite .",

    "_ showed that when the rotational degree of freedom is considered , the swimming mechanism of microswimmers directly affects the coupling between the translation and rotation of asymmetric passive tracers .",
    "therefore , it is possible to distinguish the swimming mechanism of active particles by simply imaging the diffusion of asymmetric tracers immersed in active fluids .",
    "the method should be easier and faster to implement when compared with other commonly used procedures for probing the swimming mechanism of microswimmers such as imaging the periodic time - irreversible stroke of flagella or cilia of microorganisms @xcite or mapping the far - field flow field through particle imaging velocimetry ( piv ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , the width of a single flagellum of _",
    "e. coli _ is @xmath0 nm , which can not be observed using optical microscopy without special treatments @xcite .",
    "it is hard , if not impossible , to image the concentration gradient of various chemical species around the body of self - propelled catalytic janus particles , which can be either pushers or pullers depending on the area fraction of the active catalytic region on the surface of the particles @xcite .",
    "although piv can resolve the strength of multipole flow fields to higher orders , it requires a large number of measurements to reduce statistical noise and demands manipulation of the position and orientation of individual microswimmers for image analysis @xcite .",
    "hence , the study of the dynamics of asymmetric particles in active fluids will provide not only new insights into the universal features of active fluids , but also a convenient tool for characterizing the fundamental properties of active particles .",
    "although the dynamics of spherical tracers have been studied in both pushers and pullers @xcite , the dynamics of asymmetric tracers have only been investigated in pusher - type active fluids so far @xcite . here , we reported our study on the dynamics of isolated ellipsoids in a premier puller - type active fluid  suspensions of algae _",
    "c. reinhardtii_. we studied the rich dynamics of ellipsoids in algal suspensions and drew a detailed comparison between the dynamics of ellipsoids and spherical tracers in both puller - type and pusher - type active fluids .",
    "particularly , we investigated the anisotropic diffusion of ellipsoids in the body frame and verified the prediction of the simple hydrodynamic model .",

    "@xmath181 is the rate - of - strain tensor of the dipole flow .",
    "@xmath182 is the unit vector along the major axis of the ellipsoid . in the dilute limit",
    ", the motion of the ellipsoid under the influence of many microswimmers can be obtained by averaging all the possible orientations and positions of microswimmers relative to the ellipsoid  a mean - field approximation that ignores the correlation between microswimmers .",
    "the method has been successfully used for interpreting the linear relation between the enhanced diffusivity of spherical tracers and the concentration of active particles @xcite .",
    "a coupling scaler , @xmath183 can then be defined , which quantifies the intrinsic coupling between the translation and rotation of an ellipsoid in the dipole flow @xcite .",
    "@xmath184 is a unit vector that satisfies @xmath185 when @xmath186 and @xmath187 when @xmath188 .",

    "the amplitude of @xmath190 characterizes the speed of the particle rotation , @xmath191 , and the sign of @xmath190 indicates the direction of the rotation .",
    "a negative @xmath190 corresponds to a rotation that tends to align the minor axis of the ellipsoid along with its translational direction @xmath192 , whereas a positive @xmath190 corresponds to a rotation that aligns the major axis of the ellipsoid along with @xmath192 . by taking an average over all possible orientations and positions of microswimmers , peng _ et al .",

    "@xmath195 for spherical tracers with @xmath196 .",
    "more importantly , @xmath197 for pullers and @xmath198 for pushers .",
    "the effect of a non - zero @xmath199 is equivalent to a straining flow , which rotates an asymmetric tracer in a direction depending on the swimming mechanism of microswimmers and the orientation of the tracer with respect to its translational direction .",
    "the dynamics of asymmetric tracers can thus be modeled as the diffusion of the tracers in a thermal bath with an effective temperature @xmath200 under the influence of an external rotational potential characterized by @xmath199 @xcite .",
    "the correlation time of the diffusion can be obtained by solving an over - damped langevin equation with a rotational potential , which leads to @xmath201 and @xmath202 . here , @xmath203 indicates the correlation time of the random fluctuation of the effective thermal bath , which is related to the transition time between the superdiffusive regime to the diffusion regime ( fig .",

    "different from spherical tracers that have been extensively studied , ellipsoidal tracers possess an additional rotational degree of freedom and , therefore , show much richer dynamics .    in the laboratory frame ,",
    "both translation and rotation of ellipsoids show superdiffusive motions at short times and enhanced diffusions at long times , similar to the dynamics of spherical tracers . by analyzing the probability distribution functions of the displacements of ellipsoids",
    ", we showed that the translational and rotational motions of ellipsoids can be quantitatively understood from the balance of advection and diffusion induced by the swimming of algae . due to the nature of the dipole flow of microswimmers",
    ", the translational advection shows a longer range of influence than the rotational advection .",
    "the body - frame dynamics of ellipsoids reveal the distinct difference between pushers and pullers .",
    "although when viewed independently the motions of ellipsoids along the major and minor axes show qualitatively similar trends , ellipsoids in the body frame show an unusual anisotropic diffusion , where the long - time diffusion along the major axis is more strongly enhanced with increasing algal concentrations than that along the minor axis .",
    "such an anisotropic diffusion dictates a coupling between the translation and rotation of ellipsoids in the laboratory frame . by decomposing diffusivity into different components",
    ", we demonstrated that the anisotropic diffusion arises from the differential variation of the correlation times of ellipsoids motions along the major and minor axes .",
    "the motion of an ellipsoid along its major axis becomes more persistent when algal concentration increases .",
    "this trend is in sharp contrast to the dynamics of ellipsoids in pusher - type _",
    "e. coli _ suspensions , where the persistence of the motion along the major axis decreases with increasing bacterial concentrations .",
    "this sharp difference can be qualitatively explained at the mean - field level by considering the translation - rotation coupling induced by the straining component of the dipole flow of microswimmers . as such",
    ", our study showed that the anisotropic diffusion of asymmetric tracers is a universal feature of active fluids , which can be used as a convenient experimental indicator for distinguishing pushers versus pullers .",
    "finally , our work also provided experimental results on the dynamics of asymmetric particles in suspensions of eukaryotic microorganisms .",
    "since asymmetric particles ( e.g. macromolecules and dead bodies of microorganisms ) are naturally more abundant than spherical particles , our results should be more relevant to realistic biological systems and be useful for understanding the physiology of swimming eukaryotes .",
