    "the calculations of the conductivity are technically more involved",

    "we consider here only the weak field limit and ignore the nonlinear driving terms in eq .",
    "( [ wdef ] ) .",
    "the self - couplings between gauge bosons are important , however , in the scattering processes in the plasma determining the conductivity , as we discuss below . , where the fields are intrinsically strongly interacting . in an academic universe without higgs fields",
    "the electroweak phase transition is non - existent .",
    "if , in this case , we run the temperature from far above @xmath15 to low temperatures the electroweak running coupling constants diverge at a very small temperature @xmath109gev , signalling that the interactions of the fields have become strong , and that one is in the neighborhood of the su(2 ) phase transition . for our purposes",
    "we are therefore safe in ignoring such non - linear effects and the su(2 ) phase transition .",
    "however , the nature of electrical conduction in the confined state by charged  mesons \" formed , e.g. , by @xmath110 or @xmath111 , remains an interesting problem in principle .",
    "we thank eduardo fradkin for calling this issue to our attention . ]    the electroweak fields @xmath112 act on the matter to generate currents @xmath113 of the various particles present in the plasma , such as left and right - handed leptons and their antiparticles , and quarks , vector bosons , and higgs bosons .",
    "the higgs and vector boson contributions are , as we shall see , negligible .",
    "therefore the significant terms in the currents are @xmath114 we define the conductivity tensor @xmath115 in general by @xmath116 equation ( [ sdef ] ) with the equations of motion in a gauge with @xmath117 yields the weak field flux diffusion equation for the transverse component of the fields , as in qed , @xmath118 describing the decay of weak fields in terms of the the conductivity .",
    "the electroweak @xmath119 symmetry implies that the conductivity tensor , @xmath115 , in the high temperature phase is diagonal in the representation @xmath120 , as can be seen directly from the ( weak field ) kubo formula @xmath121 which relates the conductivity to ( one - boson irreducible ) current - current correlation functions . for the @xmath122 ( @xmath123=1,2,3 ) fields and the identity matrix @xmath124 for the @xmath125 field ,",
    "one finds explicitly in one - loop order that @xmath126 ( @xmath123=0,1,2,3 ) . including the dominant interactions in the current - current loop",
    "is basically equivalent to solving the boltzmann equation , which produces no off - diagonal elements . ]",
    "the construction of the conductivity in terms of the kubo formula assures that the conductivity and hence the related entropy production in electrical conduction are positive .",
    "then @xmath127 due to isospin symmetry of the @xmath14-interactions the conductivities @xmath128 are the same , @xmath129 , but differ from the @xmath125-field conductivity , @xmath130 .    the calculation of the conductivities @xmath130 and @xmath131 in the weak field limit parallels that done for @xmath90 .",
    "the main difference is that weak interactions are no longer suppressed by a factor @xmath132 and the exchange of electroweak vector bosons must be included .",
    "the conductivity , @xmath130 , for the abelian gauge field @xmath125 can be calculated similarly to the electrical conductivity at @xmath90 .",
    "taking into account the fact that both left - handed neutrinos and charged leptons couple to the @xmath125-field with the same sign , and that they scatter the same way , their flow velocities are equal . consequently , in the scatterings @xmath27 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , whether or not the interaction is by charge exchange .",
    "the situation is thus similar to electrodynamic case .",
    "although the quarks and @xmath3 are charged , their drifts in the presence of an electric field do not significantly contribute to the electrical conductivity .",
    "charge flow of the quarks is stopped by strong interactions , while similarly flows of the @xmath3 are effectively stopped by @xmath135 , via the triple boson coupling .",
    "charged higgs bosons are likewise stopped via @xmath136 couplings .",
    "these particles do , however , affect the conductivity by scattering leptons .",
    "the lepton and quark mass terms in the weinberg - salam lagrangian provide masses only when the higgs field has a non - zero expectation value . for @xmath92",
    "the quarks and leptons have thermal masses , which , for the longitudinal ( electric ) degrees of freedom , are of order the plasma frequency , @xmath137 , and of likely order @xmath138 @xcite for the transverse ( magnetic ) mass .",
    "these small masses give rise to spin - flip interactions changing the helicity ; such interactions are , however , suppressed by factors of @xmath139 , and can therefore be neglected here .",
    "the mass terms also provide a small coupling , @xmath140 , between the higgs and leptons , proportional to the ratio of the lepton mass to the vacuum expectation value , which leads to a negligibly small contribution to the conductivity .",
    "even the coupling of @xmath141 mesons with the higgs is a factor @xmath142 smaller than their coupling to the @xmath125 field .",
    "charge transfer scatterings via higgs exchange are more singular than scatterings via @xmath125 exchange , and are enhanced by a factor @xmath143 ; nonetheless such processes are negligible .",
    "these considerations imply that the @xmath125 current consists primarily of right - handed @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , interacting only through exchange of uncharged vector bosons @xmath125 , or equivalently @xmath103 and @xmath102 .",
    "because the left - handed leptons interact through @xmath147 as well as through @xmath125 , they give only a minor contribution to the current .",
    "they are , however , effective scatterers of right - handed leptons .",

    "the terms entering the prefactor are : i ) a factor 1/2 because only the right - handed leptons contribute significantly to the conductivity ; ii ) a net factor of @xmath151 because the @xmath125 field coupling to right - handed leptons and the current @xmath152 contain factors of @xmath153 , while the square of the matrix element contains a factor @xmath154 ; and iii ) a factor @xmath155 in the scatterings of the right - handed charged leptons with right and left - handed leptons , and iv ) a factor @xmath156 in the scatterings of the right - handed charged leptons with right and left - handed quarks .",
    "the factor 9/19 holds in the limit that the temperature is much greater than the top quark mass , @xmath157 ; excluding the top quark for @xmath158 gives 108/211 instead .",
    "applying a @xmath159 field to the electroweak plasma drives the charged leptons and neutrinos oppositely since they couple through @xmath160 . in this case",
    ", exchanges of @xmath3 dominate the interactions as charge is transferred in the singular forward scatterings , so that @xmath161 .",
    "the collision term is then weighted by a factor @xmath162 instead of a factor @xmath163 and one ends up with an integral @xmath164 for the longitudinal part of the interaction . for the transverse part of the interaction one",
    "encounters a logarithmic singularity ; while landau damping is not sufficient to screen the interaction , a magnetic mass , @xmath165 , will provide an infrared cutoff .",
    "besides the logarithms , the factor @xmath166 remains and we expect that @xmath167 this effect of @xmath3 exchange is analogous to the way gluon exchange in qcd gives strong stopping and reduces the  color conductivity \" significantly @xcite ; similar effects are seen in spin diffusion in fermi liquids @xcite .",
