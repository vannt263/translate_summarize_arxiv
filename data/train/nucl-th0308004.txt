    "this addition brings the theoretical s - matrix in perfect agreement with the experimental data s - matrix from gwu / vpi and , more importantly , permits the identification of some predominant reaction paths .    the coupled two - body dirac equations , combined with the meson exchange model , yield the appearance of a repulsive , practically hard core , potential independent of partial wave .",
