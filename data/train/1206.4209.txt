    "any manyaspects of evolution , such as selection , recombination , and speciation , depend on the relationships between genotype , phenotype , and fitness .",
    "these relationships often involve complex and collective effects @xcite , which are difficult to untangle .",
    "one approach is to measure the fitness of many different genotypes , and build a _ fitness landscape _ , a high dimensional map from genotype / phenotype to reproductive fitness .",
    "this concept was first introduced by sewell wright in 1932 @xcite .",
    "evolutionary dynamics and adaptation depend crucially on features of the fitness landscape , and many studies have quantified large scale features of landscapes , including genetic interactions @xcite , the presence of stabilizing selection @xcite , or the reproducibility of evolutionary paths @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty that has precluded mapping of large fitness landscape , is _ epistasis _ , which is the dependence of fitness effects of a mutation on the presence of other mutations .",
    "epistasis makes the inference of landscapes combinatorially complex .",
    "this problem has attracted substantial attention .",
    "for example , millions of interactions between gene pairs have been measured from genetic knockout experiments @xcite .",
    "higher order epistatic interactions , that is those involving more than two loci at a time , have also been investigated for small fitness landscapes @xcite .",
    "another popular approach is mapping genotypes to phenotypes ( also known as the quantitative trait loci or qtl analysis @xcite ) , which includes the dimensionality reduction problem , but is simpler since many phenotypes are easier to quantify reliably than the number of progenies , which exhibits large fluctuations .",
    "one then separately studies the lower dimensional map from the phenotype to the reproductive rate to complete the construction of the fitness landscape .    unfortunately , few of these pioneering studies have provided a genotype to phenotype or to fitness mapping for longer genetic sequences , and most such large maps are modeled without epistasis ( see , e.  g. ,  @xcite ) . indeed , a complete landscape would be defined not by genes or specific loci , but by all possible nucleotide sequences .",
    "however with @xmath3 different sequences of length @xmath4 , it had been impractical to measure the landscapes for sequences of relatively large length until next generation sequencing technologies dramatically lowered the cost @xcite . nonetheless , measuring phenotypes of a large number of sequences is still tricky , and only a few large fitness landscapes have been quantified .",
    "for example , pitt et al .  measured the fitness landscape of @xmath5 rna sequences with an in vitro selection protocol @xcite .",
    "similarly , mora et al .",
    "studied frequencies of genetic sequences of igm molecules in zebrafish b cells ( which are related to fitnesses ) , but they imposed a translational symmetry of the sequence @xcite .",
    "finally , hinkley et al .  analyzed 70,000 hiv sequences and their _ in vitro _",
    "fitnesses , built a fitness landscape defined on different amino acids of certain hiv genes , and then investigated large scale properties of the ensuing landscape @xcite .",
    "however , even in these high throughput studies , the data did not contain all possible pairs of mutations , potentially biasing the results , especially far from the wild type sequences ( see _ discussion _ ) .    in this article",
    ", we reconstruct a large , yet detailed bacterial genotype to phenotype map , including quantifying the epistatic interactions in the ensuing fitness landscape .",
    "we seek a landscape based on long _ nucleotide _ sequences , which additionally allows quantifying phenotypes of transcriptional regulation in addition to those of enzymatic activity .",
    "this permits fitnesses to be defined over both coding and non - coding dna . to map the landscape far from the wild type genotype , we would like sampling of the sequence data that is unbiased by selection .",
    "recent experiments by kinney et al .  @xcite have collected a dataset that comes close to satisfying these criteria .",
    "the data consists of mutagenized transcriptional regulatory sequences from the _ e.coli _ ( mg1655 and tk310 strains ) _ lac _ promoter . in total",
    ", there were @xmath6 _ lac _ promoter sequences mutagenized in a 75 nucleotide region containing the camp receptor protein ( crp ) and rna polymerase ( rnap ) binding sites ( -75:-1 ) , with @xmath7 mutations per sequence ( mean @xmath8 standard deviation ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for additional data set details ) .",
    "the transcriptional activity induced by the mutagenized promoters was measured through fluorescence of the transcribed gene products and facs sorted according to the transcriptional activity into up to nine logarithmically spaced categories .",
    "all categories were then independently sequenced , so that the quantitative ( on the scale of 1 to 9 ) phenotypic effect of each sequence is known to within a certain accuracy .",
    "further , there were an additional @xmath9 sequence - expression pairs for the same operon analyzes in different enviornmental conditions .",
    "thus the data can be used to reconstruct the genotype - to - phenotype map . however",
    ", the promotor activity is directly related to lactose metabolism and thus is correlated with growth rate or fitness under conditions where lactose is the preferred energy source . therefore , the fluorescence may also be viewed as a proxy for fitness of this sequence .    in summary , the kinney et al .",
    "@xcite dataset provides simultaneous measurements of sequences and their phenotype .",
    "crucially , the data set is dense , so that every pair of mutations has occurred at least 20 times , each time in a different genetic backgrounds of about 5 other random mutations .",
    "we use these sequence and transcriptional activity data to infer the detailed genetic landscape for the 75 nucleotide dna sequence , quantifying pairwise epistatic interactions among all of the nucleotides to the accuracy afforded by the data .",
    "this is done by constructing a linear - nonlinear regression model that connects sequences to their phenotypes .",
    "since the number of possible epistatic interactions is comparable with the number of sampled sequences , we control the complexity of the models by @xmath10 regularization , and hence prevent overfitting .",
    "this also imposes sparsity on the epistatic interactions , which we expect from the limited number of binding sites .",
    "we then analyze the statistics of epistatic effects in the inferred landscape .",
    "finally , analysis of the landscapes obtained under different environmental conditions provides evidence that the wild - type sequence of the _ e.  coli lac _ promoter is close to optimal in the ecological niche that the bacterium occupies .",
    "the simplest model of a genotype to phenotype map is one where each locus contributes a fixed amount to the phenotype , regardless of the state of other loci .",
    "thus we used the sequence and the fluorescence measurements ( see _ methods _ ) to fit an additive map using linear regression of the fluorescence values @xmath11 ( integers 1 to 9 ) on the genetic code which are treated as 75 categorical variables with four levels : a , t , g , c .",
    "the dummy variables encode the presence of mutations relative to the wild type ( @xmath12 when a mutation is present , and @xmath13 otherwise ) .",
    "since there are four nucleic acids , each locus has three binary numbers for each of the possible mutations from the wild - type , and the sequence length is effectively tripled . in other words , for each locus , 000 represents the wild - type , and 001 , 010 , 100 represent the three mutations ( see table [ tbl : code ] in _ methods _ ) .",
    "the statistical model is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the statistical noise , and the superscript @xmath16 stands for a single bacterium , for which the sequence , @xmath17 , and the fluorescence , @xmath18 , are known . in subsequent equations ,",
    "the superscript is suppressed for brevity .",
    "part of the genotype - phenotype map may be non - linear due to the mapping from fluorescence to bin number and due to some remaining background fluorescence .",
    "thus we replace @xmath11 with a non - linear monotonic function @xmath19 chosen to optimize the explanatory power of the nonepistatic statistical model , and likely bias downwards inferred effects of epistatic contributions ( see _ methods _ ) .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are found by ordinary least squares regression , e.  g. , coefficients that minimize @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) . since the wild - type is a sequence of all zeros , @xmath23 is the predicted phenotype of the wild type .    the coefficient @xmath24 measures the goodness of fit , or how much of the variance in the data , @xmath25 , is explained by the model . the linear model yields",
    "@xmath26 .",
    "some variation in the data is experimental noise , such as background fluorescence and cell - to - cell variability , and sets an upper bound on the possible @xmath27 . in _ methods",
    "_ , we estimate this _ intrinsic _ noise to be 10 - 24% , and therefore about 76 - 90% of the total variability of the data can be explained by _ any _ statistical model , even an arbitrarily complex model .",
    "therefore the linear model accounts for 57 - 67% of the explainable variance .",
    "we emphasize that this statement is not about mechanistic underpinnings of the genotype - to - phenotype relation , but about statistics of the data only . as in any multivariate model",
    ", it is possible for the statistical linear effects to emerge from superposition of many mechanistic epistatic interactions .",
    "stem plot of the linear coefficients .",
    "three circles on each stem represent the changes in phenotype for each of the three possible mutations per site .",
    "crp and rnap are known to each bind at two sites ( magenta and cyan areas ) .",
    "red circles correspond to the mutations needed to get the consensus sequences.,width=336 ]    examination of the coefficients @xmath28 with the largest magnitude reveals the consensus locations of the crp and rnap binding sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linearcoeff ] ) , which validates the modeling approach .",
    "interestingly , the wild type does not contain the `` consensus '' binding sequences : @xmath29 for crp @xcite and @xmath30 for rnap @xcite , but the wild type is only four mutations away .",
    "four of the large positive coefficients in fig .",
    "[ fig : linearcoeff ] ( positions -54 , -34 , -9 , -8 , red circles ) correspond to the mutations needed to get the consensus sequences .",
    "these inferred coefficients may be compared to the energy matrices derived from the same data with information theoretic techniques by kinney et al .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the energy matrices were inferred separately for crp and rnap , and also over many different experiments , while our regression coefficients were inferred from the whole sequence data .",
    "correlation between our @xmath31 s and the energy matrices ranged from 89%-91% for crp binding sites .",
    "this is comparable to the 95% correlation among energy matrices estimated from different subsets of the data in @xcite .",
    "such an agreement between a manifestly simple linear - nonlinear model and the results of a computationally complex optimization of information - theoretic quantities is truly surprising and encouraging .",
    "since correlations among various energy matrices for the rnap binding are somewhat lower ( 92% ) @xcite , we expect the agreement between the regression and the information - theoretic methods to be worse for this case .",
    "indeed , the correlations between @xmath31 s and energy matrices range between 46% and 54% .",
    "we expect that this reduction can be attributed partially to the fact that the energy matrices were inferred by kinney et al .  for crp and rnap separately or jointly in a _",
    "thermodynamic _ model , which assumed a direct relation between rnap binding and the transcription rate .",
    "it has been discussed and measured repeatedly @xcite that transcription rate is strongly affected by kinetics of transcriptional initiation , which is not modeled for by the thermodynamic probability of finding rnap bound to the regulatory sequence . unlike the energy matrices , our statistical model inferred from the entire sequence can account for these kinetic effects , and may be more accurate in this context .",
    "since such effects are absent for transcription factor binding , they can potentially explain the differences in agreements between the models observed for crp and rnap binding sites .",
    "such kinetic effects may also explain the difference between the wild type and the consensus ( that is , the strongest ) binding sequences mentioned above .",
    "additional biophysical experiments are needed to carefully explore these issues .",
    "the simplest model with epistatic interactions between all pairs of nucleotides is a quadratic or bilinear model , written as : @xmath32 the last sum is over all nucleotide pairs .",
    "here nonzero @xmath33 would indicate the presence of pairwise epistasis .",
    "for example , @xmath34 , and @xmath33 all of the same sign is comonly referred as synergistic epistasis , where contribution of the pair of mutations is stronger than of each mutation alone .",
    "other possible types of epistasis are described below .",
    "note that , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quadratic ] ) , we keep @xmath19 the same as in the previous section , which maximizes the explanatory power of the non - epistatic terms and minimizes that for the epistatic terms .",
    "the number of epistatic terms in this statistical model ( @xmath35 ) should be contrasted with typical biophysical models of protein - dna interactions , which include only a single free energy term describing interactions between the crp and rnap proteins @xcite .",
    "the total number of coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath36 , and @xmath33 in the quadratic epistasis model , eq.([eq : quadratic ] ) , is 25,201 ( accounting for the fact that , in a single genome , only one mutation per site is allowed ) .",
    "overfitting is a concern since the number of observations , 129,000 , is not much larger than the number of coefficients . to infer a model that does",
    "not overfit , we applied a standard regularization procedure , which penalizes overly complex models and imposes sparsity on the number of nonzero interaction terms ( see _ methods _ ) . since available genotypes were not uniformly distributed , but rather biased towards the wild type , we supplemented traditional cross - validation approaches with additional checks to ensure that the regularization selects the model with the highest explanatory power , but no overfitting . the chosen model and its coefficients are discussed in the following . as we show in _ methods _ , fig .  [ fig : sensitivity ] , the general structure of the inferred epistatic coefficients @xmath33 is only weakly dependent on the specifics of the model choice .",
    "histogram of phenotype @xmath19 values of @xmath37 uniformly random sequences for the inferred epistatic model .",
    "random sequences have very low inferred phenotype values because of the specificity of binding sites .",
    "the peak of the distribution indicates what phenotype values evolve under neutral conditions .",
    "the the wild - type value , @xmath23 ( green line ) , is much higher than the neutral value indicating selective pressure.,width=288 ]    the distribution of inferred phenotype values for randomly generated sequences ( fig.[fig : opthistrand2 ] ) shows that the random sequences are typically not very functional ( presumably because the binding sites loose specificity ) .",
    "the peak near @xmath38 represents the most common sequence that would be observed under neutral evolution , and the relatively high value for the wild - type ( @xmath39 ) compared to the random sequences indicates that it is under strong selection . notice",
    "that we can assert this without any comparative genomics or population genetics data , which would typically be required .",
    "the fraction of variance explained by the pairwise epistatic model is @xmath40 ( although it is sensitive to the regularization parameter , cf .",
    "[ fig : lasso1 ] ) . comparing to the non - epistatic model with @xmath41 , and taking into account the intrinsic experimental noise of 10 - 24%",
    ", we see that about 7% of the explainable variance is due to the pairwise epistasis .",
    "however , it is possible that more data would increase the amount of predictive power of the epistatic contributions .",
    "furthermore , combinations of multiple epistatic interactions may have a net nonepistatic contribution to the phenotype ( but not the other way around ) .",
    "thus this 7% figure is , in many respects , a negatively biased estimate of importance of epistasis .",
    "the non - epistatic coefficients are about 70% non - zero , but the interaction terms are very sparse , about 3% non - zero .",
    "the phenotype is affected by mutations in some positions more than others .",
    "coefficients with the largest magnitudes belong to positions within the crp and rnap binding sites ( see fig.[fig : interactions ] ) .",
