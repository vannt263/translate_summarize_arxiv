    "it is expected that results obtained in one renormalisation scheme will be related to those obtained in another by a ( finite ) redefinition of the couplings and fields of the theory .",
    "the required redefinition may be easily constructed by considering the finite differences between the bare quantities in the two schemes . in particular , the @xmath1-function in one scheme may be derived from the @xmath1-function in the other , in a well - known manner .",
    "the most widely - used scheme is of course minimal subtraction within dimensional regularisation , or more precisely its variant @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we discuss the issues involved in relating a general non - minimal scheme to @xmath0 in two cases : a general theory of fermions and scalars with multiple fields and couplings in four dimensions , and a general scalar theory with multiple fields and couplings in six dimensions .",
    "the procedure is implicit in the standard literature@xcite in general terms , but the detailed implementation for a theory of multiple fields and couplings presents some problems , especially in connection with one - particle reducible ( 1pr ) 2-point function contributions , which we elucidate here .",
    "our results apply to any non - minimal scheme ; however at appropriate points we shall emphasise especially the application to the most widely - used non - minimal scheme , namely momentum subtraction ( mom ) .",
    "the mom scheme was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for a three - loop computation in six - dimensional @xmath2 theory  one of the theories we shall consider in detail later",
    ". however it was used more widely following its independent development for qcd in ref .",
    "the renormalisation constants of the mom scheme are defined such that all the green s functions are set to their tree values at the subtraction point@xcite .",
    "variations ( called `` hybrid '' mom schemes ) have also been discussed where the renormalisation constants associated with @xmath3-point functions are defined in a different way to the coupling - constant renormalisations@xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for further computations in this scheme ) . motivated by this",
    ", we shall consider similar `` hybrid '' schemes in the general non - minimal case .",
    "we shall describe our results here in a little more detail , before presenting the full calculation in the following sections .",
    "the coupling redefinition which takes us from @xmath0 to a non - minimal scheme may readily be derived .",
    "when we implement it , we find a non - zero prediction at three - loop order for certain @xmath1-function terms corresponding to 1pr contributions to the anomalous dimension @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , these terms depend on the antisymmetric part of a certain 1pr contribution to @xmath4 .",
    "one s natural expectation might be that such terms should vanish ; but when one reviews the complications involved in performing an explicit computation , it becomes clear that intuition may not be a reliable guide . for a non - minimal subtraction scheme such as mom , the process of computing the @xmath1-function from the bare couplings of the theory is non - trivial , and an additional complexity is introduced when one recalls that the computation of the two - point function in fact only determines the symmetric part .",
    "we resort to an indirect argument to obtain the antisymmetric part , based upon working back from the anomalous dimension as obtained by scheme change from @xmath0 .",
    "finally , it is important to recall that the coupling redefinition which effects the scheme change is accompanied by a corresponding field redefinition .",
    "this has no effect on the prediction for the @xmath1-function , but crucially it does affect the anomalous dimension and thereby our indirect method of computation of the @xmath1-function in the non - minimal scheme .    the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we consider first a scalar - fermion theory in four dimensions in sect . 2 , and then a scalar theory in six dimensions in sect .",
    "the renormalisation of these theories is familiar in the literature , at least as far as 1pi contributions are concerned .",
    "we therefore try to present only as much background is needed to follow the arguments .",
    "we finish with conclusions in sect . 4 and list some explicit diagrammatic results in appendix a , and basic general results from renormalisation theory in appendix b.",
    "we consider here a theory in four dimensions containing @xmath5 two - component weyl fermion fields @xmath6 , and @xmath7 real scalar fields @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the lagrangian is l=-^^t_-i.-(_a^tc(y^i)_ab_b^i+)-^ijkl^i^j^k^l , where the yukawa coupling @xmath10 is a @xmath11 matrix , and @xmath12 is the charge conjugation matrix . as mentioned earlier , the features of interest first appear at three - loop order . in this section",
    "we shall consider at three loops only the mixed yukawa - scalar contributions .",
    "this is because the only relevant two - loop diagram in this case has only a simple pole , which simplifies the calculations .",
    "however we shall see later that the full calculation in fact has a very similar overall structure .",
    "we start by describing the renormalisation process up to two loops .",
    "this allows us to define and discuss in some detail the renormalisation procedure for a general non - minimal scheme , allowing for the possibility of a hybrid scheme .",
    "we then turn to the three - loop calculation in the non - minimal scheme .",
    "our explicit calculation is motivated by the ( at least to us ) surprising results for @xmath1-function contributions corresponding to 1pr contributions to the 2-point function , as obtained by coupling redefinition starting from @xmath0 .",
    "it is however more natural pedagogically to start with the explicit 3-loop @xmath1-function computation of these terms ( which we shall describe for conciseness as `` 1pr2 terms '' ) .",
    "the method is quite complicated and somewhat indirect , so we begin by giving an overview of the procedure .",
    "firstly we shall need the 2-point renormalisation constants corresponding to 3-loop 1pr contributions .",
    "however , the standard computation of the 2-point function only yields the symmetrised result . in order to obtain the corresponding antisymmetric part of the result and thus the separate contributions",
    ", we rely on an indirect calculation working back from the antisymmetric part of the anomalous dimension , which is obtained by coupling _ and field _ redefinition from @xmath0 .",
    "next ( in order to discuss the `` hybrid '' scheme where two and three point functions are treated differently ) we consider the 3-loop 3-point diagrams corresponding to 1pr2 terms .",
    "the information we now have is sufficient to compute the required renormalisation constants . from these",
    ", we can compute the @xmath1-function coefficients ; in a non - minimal scheme these are not simply derived from the simple poles in the renormalisation constants .",
    "we find a non - zero result for the `` 1pr2 '' contribution . finally , we consider the predictions for these three - loop @xmath1-function terms , this time derived by coupling redefinition from @xmath0 , and show that the prediction agrees exactly with the explicit calculation .",
    "we start by regularising the theory by replacing @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 by corresponding bare quantities @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , defined by @xmath19 with a similar expression for @xmath17 .",
    "( however , it turns out that up to three loops , with the mixed scalar - yukawa contributions to which we have restricted ourselves , we do not need to distinguish @xmath20 from @xmath21 . )",
    "@xmath22 denotes the terms corresponding to 1pi diagrams .",
    "this is all very standard except that we allow for the renormalisation constant @xmath23 for @xmath13 to differ from that appearing in @xmath18 , denoted @xmath24 . in @xmath0 ,",
    "for instance , they would be the same ; but in a non - minimal scheme this is not mandatory  though @xmath24 and @xmath23 will differ only in their finite parts , or for 1pr contributions .",
    "consequently we shall need to start by discussing two - point diagrams to fix @xmath23 and then turn to three - point diagrams to determine @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; and , contrary to the usual @xmath0 calculation , we shall need to include 1pr three - point diagrams to compute @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we start by discussing the calculation up to two loops , which will give us the opportunity to introduce the various renormalisation schemes .",
    "the two - loop results may all be found in ref .  @xcite . at one loop the relevant two - point and three - point diagrams are shown in table [ 1loop4d ] .",
    "they give    @xmath26    where g_1=+_10+  [gdef ] ( ignoring here @xmath27 terms ) , and ( t_1)^ij=(y^iy^j ) .",

    "an important consequence of the afore - mentioned cancellation of @xmath23 on internal lines is that the pole parts of counterterms for 1pi 3-point and 2-point terms depend only on the poles in the diagrams , together with the finite parts in @xmath24 . in other words",
    "they depend only on @xmath61 , etc , and @xmath62 , etc , and not on @xmath63 , etc ( or , equivalently , on @xmath64 , etc ) .",
    "this means that the scheme dependence of the 1pi contributions to the @xmath1-function is determined purely by the choice of finite parts in @xmath24 ; the finite parts of @xmath23 play no role in this .",

    "specifically , the appearance of potential 1pr @xmath1-function contributions was noticed during the demonstration of the scheme independence of these consisteny conditions .",
