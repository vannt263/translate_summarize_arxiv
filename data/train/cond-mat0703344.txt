    "the theory of quantum measurement , being a foundation of quantum physics , is attracting more and more attention @xcite .",
    "intrinsic paradoxes @xcite are definitely a main reason for studying quantum measurements .",
    "more motivation comes from the practical needs to understand the real solid - state based devices @xcite developed for quantum computing @xcite .",
    "measurements in solid - state setups may provide access to extra variables that facilitate the read out of the quantum information stored in the elementary two - level quantum systems ( qubits ) .",
    "the concept of continuous weak linear measurement ( cwlm ) , where the interaction between the detector and the measured system is explicit and sufficiently weak , has been recently elaborated in context of the solid state quantum computing @xcite .",
    "cwlm provides a universal description of the measurement process and is based on general linear response theory @xcite .",
    "it applies to a large class of linear detectors : from common amplifiers to more exotic on - chip detectors such as quantum point contact @xcite , superconducting set transistors @xcite , generic mesoscopic conductors @xcite , fluxons in a josephson transmission line to measure a flux qubit @xcite .",
    "it is an important feature of cwlm that the ( quantum ) information is transferred from a quantum system being measured  a qubit  to other degrees of freedom : those of the detector .",
    "the outcome of the measurement is thus represented by the detector degrees of freedom rather than those of the qubit .",
    "we will address both the statistics of the outcomes and joint statistics of the outcomes and the qubit degrees of freedom .",
    "we stress the difference between the detector outcomes and the outcomes of a projective measurement of a qubit . in distinction from the result of a projective measurement ,",
    "the detector outcome is not discrete , since the detector output ( for instance , voltage or current ) is a continuous variable .",
    "the outcomes do not even have to correlate with the state of the qubit if the detector is uncoupled .",
    "further , the detector variables are subject to noise not related to the qubit . owing to the feedback of the detector at the qubit",
    ", this noise affects the qubit too .    in comparison with the text - book projective measurement that instantly provides a result and projects the system onto the state corresponding to the result",
    ", the cwlm takes time both to accumulate the information and to distort the qubit .",
    "the time @xmath0 required to obtain a sufficiently accurate measurement result is called `` measurement time '' and is a characteristic of a cwlm setup .",
    "it is not a duration of an individual measurement in this setup : the latter may vary .",
    "the distortion is due to the inevitable back action of the detector and is characterized by the dephasing rate @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for an optimized  quantum limited  detector @xmath2 while the `` measurement time '' @xmath3 greatly exceeds @xmath4 for less optimal detectors .    in the context of quantum information theory",
    ", cwlm may be understood as an interaction of the qubit with infinitely many ancillary qubits representing the detector degrees of freedom .",
    "each ancilla is brought to weakly interact with the qubit for a short time and is subsequently measured .",
    "owing to the interaction , the quantum state of the ancillae is entangled with the state of the qubit .",
    "the detector output is proportional to the sum of the measurement results of a large set of ancillae .",
    "this allows to transfer quantum information from the qubit to the detector without formal projective measurement of the qubit .",
    "therefore the peculiarities of the cwlm can be understood in the framework of a projective measurement , although a more complicated one involving the detector degrees of freedom .",
    "the cwlm can be thus seen as a build - up of an entanglement between the qubit and the detector .",
    "an outcome of an individual cwlm is the detector output accumulated during the time interval of a certain duration @xmath5 .",
    "any cwlm can be described as a generalized quantum measurement , that involves qubit and detector degrees of freedom .",
    "the outcome randomly varies from measurement to measurement .",
    "we argue here that studying statistics of the measurement outcomes of a cwlm is the best way to understand and characterize such a measurement .",
    "this is especially important for the simultaneous measurement of non - commuting variables ( say , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) we concentrate on in this work . in this case , the text - book projective measurement can not help to predict the statistics of the results : it would depend on the order of measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this property of the measurements in non - commuting bases enables most quantum cryptography @xcite algorithms and has been extensively elucidated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one can straightforwardly realize in experiment a cwlm of a quantum system where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are measured simultaneously .",
    "if @xmath6 and @xmath7 commute , the statistics of the outcomes of sufficiently long cwlm corresponds to the predictions of projective measurement scheme ( see sec .",
    "the projective measurement scheme loses its predictive power if @xmath6 and @xmath7 do not commute .",
    "the reason is that the order of measurement of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is not determined in the course of a continuous measurement .",
    "the statistics of cwlm outputs thus can not be straightforwardly conjectured and has to be evaluated from the quantum mechanical treatment of the whole system consisting of the qubit and the detectors .    in a sharp contrast to the case of commuting variables ,",
    "the most probable outcome of a sufficiently long cwlm of non - commuting variables does not depend on the qubit state .",
    "therefore it provides no information about the qubit .",
    "the information is however hidden in the statistics of random outcomes .",
    "recently , the simultaneous acquisition of two non - communing observables was investigated in the framework of cwlm @xcite , and the correlation of the random output of two detectors was found to be informative .",
    "not only noise , but the whole full counting statistics ( fcs ) of the non - commuting measurements has been recently addressed for an example of many spins traversing the detectors @xcite .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows .",
    "we develop the necessary formalism in sec .",
    "our approach stems from the fcs theory of electron transfers @xcite in the extended keldysh formalism @xcite , which has been recently discussed @xcite in the context of the quantum measurement . at first step ,",
    "we obtain a feynman - vernon action to describe the fluctuations of the input and output variables of the detector(s ) . in the relevant limit ,",
    "the action is local in time .",
    "so at the second step we reduce the path integral to the solution of a differential equation that appears to be a bloch - redfield equation augmented with the counting field . in sec .",
    "iii we exemplify the formalism addressing a relatively simple case of quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the distribution of the outcomes for a single detector and understand the statistics of a recently proposed quantum un - demolition measurement@xcite .",
    "the main results are presented in sec .",
    "iv where we discuss statistics of measurement of non - commuting variables for the case of three independent detectors measuring the three components of the qubit pseudo - spin .",
    "we find the statistical correspondence between the three outcomes and three wavefunction components after the measurement .",
    "the correspondence is characterized by a fidelity that generally increases with the magnitude of the outcomes reaching the ideal value @xmath8 in the limit of large magnitudes . since",
    "very large outcomes are statistically rare and require long waiting times , this result could be of a purely theoretical value . to prove the opposite ,",
    "we have evaluated the fidelity at moderate magnitudes of outcomes and measurement durations @xmath5 and we were able to demonstrate the fidelity of @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "we term this `` quantum monitoring '' .",
    "ideally , the result of the quantum monitoring is a pure state of the qubit and three numbers ( detector outputs ) giving the polarization of the state .",
    "the same result can be also achieved by preparing the qubit state of the known polarization , for instance , by a projective measurement along a certain axis .",
    "the difference is that in the case of preparation the polarization axis is known to the observer in advance , while in the case of monitoring it is not so : both the three numbers and the state emerge from dynamics of the quantum system that encompasses the qubit and the detectors .",
    "we discuss the relation between the quantum monitoring proposed and the quantum algorithms that use the results of partial measurements that we summarize in sec .",
    "v. we evaluate the detector action in the appendix a. we prove in the appendix b that our approach correspond to a lindblad scheme for a system consisting of the detectors and the qubit .",
    "we start the outline of the formalism with a simplest setup where a single detector measures a single component of the qubit pseudo - spin . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian reads as follows :    @xmath11    here , @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of the qubit generally given by a linear combination of three pauli matrices @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) corresponding to three components of the qubit pseudo - spin .",
    "@xmath17 gives the coupling between the detector and the third component of the pseudo - spin of the qubit , @xmath18 being the detector _ input _",
    "@xmath19 stands for the hamiltonian of the detector . since we assume linear dynamics of the detector variables , a general form of this hamiltonian",
    "is that of a boson bath , @xmath20 this encompasses infinitely many boson degrees of freedom labeled by @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the corresponding annihilation operators .",
    "the output of the detector is given by the _ output _ variable @xmath23 .",
    "an arbitrary linear dynamics is reproduced if both variables @xmath18 and @xmath23 are linear combinations of the boson creation / annihilation operators , @xmath24 this is in the spirit of caldeira - leggett approach@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the work @xcite we do not assume thermal equilibrium in the boson bath .",
    "in fact , this assumption would be wrong for most practical detectors since a signal amplification can not take place in the state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the only requirement we impose is that wick s theorem holds for the boson operators involved .",
    "this guarantees the linear dynamics of the detector variables . besides , this conveniently allows us",
    "_ not _ to specify the coefficients @xmath25 .",
    "all information about the coefficients and the non - equilibrium boson distribution is incorporated into the two - point correlators of the variables explicitly given below ( eqs .",
    "7 - 8 ) . by virtue of wick s theorem ,",
    "the averages of all possible products of the detector variables can be expressed in terms of these two - point correlators .",
    "we are interested in the statistics of the detector output variable @xmath23 .",
    "we note that this variable is distinct from those of the qubit and in principle even does not have to correlate with the qubit state ( e.g. if @xmath26 ) .",
    "however , since the detector is supposed to measure the qubit , there must be a ( high ) degree of correspondence between the detector output and the qubit state .",
    "this sets the goal of our calculation : to access the joint statistics of @xmath23 and the qubit variables .    to achieve the goal",
    ", we introduce a counting field @xmath27 coupled to the output variable @xmath23 and use a modified feynman - vernon scheme @xcite where the evolution of the `` bra '' and `` ket '' wave function is governed by different hamiltonians @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 corresponds to two branches of closed time contour respectively @xcite .",
    "this scheme was first employed in the work @xcite .",

    "it separates into @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the initial density matrix of the detector and qubit respectively .",
    "this implies that the detector and the qubit do not interact before the initial time moment @xmath40 .",
    "next , we employ the path integral representation for the probability - generating function @xcite . according to feynman and vernon @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) : @xmath41 here @xmath42 are two - dimensional vectors of the detector variables @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",

    "this is not much slower than the qnd measurement of the same accuracy .",
    "let us explain the relation between the monitoring discussed and the quantum algorithms that use the results of partial measurement .",
    "these algorithms have been introduced in the context of two - qubit systems @xcite but also may be applied to a general quantum state @xcite .",
    "speaking very generally , such algorithms start with a quantum state , pure or mixed , and aim at producing another state ( pure and/or highly entangled ) .",

    "each step involves interaction with ancilla qubits that results in an entanglement of the qubit and the ancillae .",
    "importantly , the projective measurement of ancilla qubit(s ) is performed at each step .",
    "the result of this measurement is used to _ decide _ upon next step : possible decisions include to re - request the initial state , to stop since the fidelity desired is reached , to apply a certain quantum gate .",
    "the quantum monitoring proceeds similarly .",
    "it starts with an almost isotropic initial state : @xmath261 .",
    "the qubit is being measured by our three independent quantum limit detectors during a time interval @xmath180 .",
    "the outcome of the detectors is used to _ make a decision_. if the sum of the square of the three detectors output @xmath217 of are small : @xmath262 , the measurement is disregarded : this is an analog of re - requesting the initial state .",
    "the measurement is repeated until the values of the outputs are sufficiently high @xmath263 . in this case , the monitoring may stop since its goal is reached : the qubit is purified to a state given by the detector outputs @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 . since the @xmath217 ( @xmath267 ) are random , the purified state of the qubit is also random",
    ". thus one could say that the cwlm monitoring implements a quantum algorithm of the sort described , in the same sense as an analogous computer may implement discrete computer algorithms .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown how to evaluate the full statistics of the outcomes of a cwlm on a qubit .",
    "we are also able to evaluate joint probability distribution of the outcomes and the qubit variables after the measurement . for a single detector ,",
    "we have illustrated the qnd measurements and understood the recent proposal of quantum un - demolition measurement .",
    "most interesting results concern the simultaneous cwlm of three non - commuting variables by three detectors .",
    "such `` measurement '' is obtrusive and typically scrambles the initial qubit wavefunction .",
    "however , we have demonstrated a high degree of correspondence between the wave function _",
    "after _ the measurement and the outcomes of the three detectors . therefore , such cwlm may be used for high - fidelity quantum _ monitoring _ of the qubit .",
    "the monitoring in fact amounts to a _",
    "purification _ of the qubit state in a random direction @xmath268 at bloch sphere , @xmath269 being random outputs of the detectors .",
    "we have drawn analogy with quantum algorithms that use the outputs of ancilla measurements to decide on the purification degree reached and the quantum gates to be applied .",
    "the interpretation we give to the results is of course not the only possible one .",
    "the communications with several colleagues have convinced us that `` interesting '' and `` important '' defy an unambiguous definition as far as theory of quantum measurement is concerned . in any case , we have developed calculational tools to access the joint probability of the qubit degrees of freedom and the outcomes of linear detectors measuring the qubit .",
