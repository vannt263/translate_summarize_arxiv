    "the exclusive queueing process ( eqp ) @xcite is a queueing model that takes into account the spatial structure of the queue . in standard queueing theory , which is a well - established approach of practical relevance @xcite , the system length and the number of particles are identical , so that the density along the queue is always 1 . in the eqp ,",
    "particles interact with each other through an exclusion principle , i.e. they can move forward only when the target site is empty . thus the density is not a constant .",
    "the eqp is equivalent to the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite of varying length .",
    "one end of the chain is fixed and corresponds to the server to which particles move .",
    "arriving particles always join the queue at the site just behind the opposite end of the queue . in earlier works",
    "@xcite the phase diagram of the eqp with parallel update scheme has been determined exactly .",
    "it shows two main phases that correspond to queues with converging and diverging lengths .",
    "these phases can further be divided into several subphases , see @xcite for details .    in the previous work @xcite , unusual critical behavior of the eqp has been observed .",
    "this indicates that dynamical systems of fluctuating length might show surprising properties .",
    "due to the relevance of stochastic processes with varying system length , in particular for applications to biology @xcite , it is worthwhile to explore them in more detail . extending our previous works",
    ", here we introduce an eqp with langmuir kinetics ( eqp - lk ) that allows creation and annihilation of particles anywhere in the bulk of the queue , not only at the ends .",
    "this can be interpreted as an effective model for interacting queues . for customer queues",
    ", customers might change to ( from ) the bulk of the queue from ( to ) other queues .",
    "looking at a specific queue this has the same effects as langmuir kinetics characterized by a detachment probability @xmath0 and an attachment probability @xmath1 ( if every vacancy in the queue can be occupied by an arriving customer ) .    in this work",
    ", we shall characterize the eqp - lk via the system length @xmath2 at time @xmath3 .",
    "we begin by introducing a naive test to determine whether the system length diverges or converges to a stationary length by averaging simulation samples with initial condition @xmath4 .",
    "next we shall examine the time evolution of the average system length @xmath5 .",
    "surprisingly its behavior depends on the initial system length @xmath6 , indicating the breaking of ergodicity .",
    "furthermore , we shall see that individual simulation samples can exhibit different behaviors .",
    "we shall qualitatively explain these unexpected phenomena by constructing a random walk model which captures the essential features of the length dynamics .",
    "we expect that these new insights could be of relevance also for the interpretation of experimental studies on systems of varying length , especially in biology .",
    "the model that we study is a combination of the eqp with parallel update @xcite and langmuir kinetics ( eqp - lk ) , see fig .  [",
    "fig : eqplk ] .",
    "it is defined on a semi - infinite one - dimensional lattice , where the sites are numbered from right to left .",
    "each site @xmath7 is either occupied by a particle ( @xmath8 ) or empty ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "our model s state space is infinite but countable , consisting of configurations @xmath10 and a state @xmath11 where there is no particle .",
    "the system length @xmath12 is defined by the leftmost occupied site or @xmath13 for the state @xmath11 .",
    "the system length is , in general , different from the number of particles , in contrast to classical queueing models .",
    "particles move forward ( rightward in fig .",
    "[ fig : eqplk ] ) with probability @xmath14 in each time step only if the preceding site is unoccupied . a new particle enters at the end of the queue ( i.e. @xmath15 ) with probability @xmath16 .",
    "when there is no particle in the system , a new particle enters directly at site @xmath17 .",
    "particles in the bulk are detached with probability @xmath0 , and for each empty site @xmath18 a particle is attached with probability @xmath1 . as in the tasep with langmuir kinetics ( tasep - lk ) @xcite , the attachment and detachment probabilities are scaled with the system length as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the total probabilites @xmath21 and @xmath22 are kept constant .",
    "then inflow and outflow caused by the langmuir kinetics are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the global density of the system .",
    "it is of the same order of magnitude as the boundary currents so that the dynamics of the system is determined by a competition between bulk and boundary dynamics .",
    "in contrast to the tasep - lk , the system length @xmath12 of the eqp - lk varies , and thus the probabilities @xmath26 depend on the current state and thus has to be determined from the fixed values of @xmath27 as @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in each time step ,",
    "first the configuration is updated according to the rule of the eqp with parallel update , and then the langmuir kinetics is applied .",
    "this defines the eqp - lk with parameters @xmath28 , which is generically an irreducible and aperiodic discrete - time markov process .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the system length at time @xmath3 for a realization ( a simulation run ) of the stochastic process and by @xmath5 its average over different realizations .",
    "first we revisit the eqp with parallel update , corresponding to the special case of the eqp - lk with @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter space is divided into two regimes by the `` critical line '' @xmath30 for @xmath31 ( `` convergent phase '' ) , the average length @xmath32 converges to a stationary value . on the other hand , for @xmath33 ( `` divergent phase '' )",
    ", @xmath32 diverges .",
    "these properties were shown rigorously by constructing an exact stationary distribution @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the divergent phase , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath32 was shown to be linear in time @xmath34 with an explicit form for the velocity @xmath35 , by simulations for general @xmath14 @xcite and by using an exact time - dependent solution for @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "now we introduce a test to distinguish between diverging and converging system lengths by simulations . starting from @xmath4 , the quantity @xmath37 approaches @xmath38 as @xmath39 in the convergent phase . on the other hand ,",

    "only finite @xmath43 can be studied . here",
    "we set @xmath44 .",
    "averages are calculated with a finite number @xmath45 of samples .",
    "the phase transition is identified as the point where @xmath46 becomes bigger than the average @xmath47 when @xmath16 is increased with the other parameters fixed on the phase transition line ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , it provides a convenient criterion that allows to distinguish ( linear ) divergence from convergence in the simulations . ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase0](a ) , we observe that for the eqp the critical line obtained by this test agrees with the exact line .",
    "let us apply the test to the eqp - lk , again starting from the initial state @xmath11 .",
    "the phase boundary between the two phases depends on the langmuir probabilities @xmath21 and @xmath22 , see fig .",

    "the natural observation is that the convergent phase is enlarged for increasing values of @xmath21 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase0 ] ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "again the critical line becomes a straight segment ( which is independent of @xmath16 ) as @xmath22 increases .     and",
    "@xmath51 , determined by the test . for comparison , the exact critical line for the eqp case @xmath52 is shown , which is recovered by the test . ]",

    ", all the average lengths ( @xmath54 ) converge to a stationary value . in ( b ) , we observe not all the average lengths converge . ]    the eqp - lk with generic values of parameters is an irreducible and aperiodic markov process on a countable state space .",
    "the general theory of markov processes @xcite tells us that the convergence of @xmath32 is independent of the initial state .",
    "we now check this property by simulations .",
    "for example , the case @xmath55 is determined to be in the convergent phase by the test ( [ eq : test ] ) .",
    "in fact , the average lengths @xmath32 over @xmath45 simulation samples with other initial lengths @xmath56 converge to the same stationary value , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ergo - nonergo](a ) .",
    "surprisingly , however , this is not always true .",
    "for example , for @xmath57 the average length @xmath40 with @xmath58 converges but the average lengths with large initial lengths ( e.g. @xmath59 ) do not converge , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ergo - nonergo](b ) .",
    "furthermore , starting from an intermediate length ( e.g.  @xmath60 ) , the average length @xmath40 exhibits a non - monotonic behavior . in the inset of fig .",

    "the parameters were set as eqn .  , and every sample started from the length @xmath60 and the density @xmath65 .",
    "more precisely , the bars in ( b ) represent the number of samples that satisfy @xmath66 .",
    "the inset shows more detailed distribution near @xmath67 , i.e. the bars represent the numbers of samples such that @xmath68 . ]",
    "first , let us investigate the behavior of _ individual _ samples . comparing the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : ergo - nonergo](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : l0350](a ) , we notice that the individual behaviors do not perfectly mimic the behavior of the average . in other words",
    ", the average does not represent the _ typical _ behavior of individual samples .",
    "therefore the dynamics of the system can not be properly understood by just looking at averages .",
    "for example , on the `` coexistence line '' of the tasep with open boundaries , the average density profile is linear .",
    "however , this does not imply that a shock is moving , which can only be observed for individual samples @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : l0350](a ) , we observe that 5 of 9 samples hit @xmath69 within @xmath70 .",
    "we call them _ converging samples_. the other 4 samples increase almost linearly in time , even after @xmath71 ( _ diverging samples _ ) .",
    "let us look at statistics of @xmath72 samples with the same parameter setting and the same initial length [ fig .",
    "[ fig : l0350](b ) ] . apparently there are two peaks at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , corresponding to converging and diverging samples , respectively . because of the strong effect of the detachment @xmath75 , it is difficult to escape from @xmath76 after reaching @xmath77 , see the inset of in fig .",
    "[ fig : l0350](b ) .",
    "the non - monotonicity observed for the average @xmath5 is due to the dominance of the contributions from the diverging samples whereas the contribution of the converging can be neglected once they have reached @xmath78 .",
    "we note that @xmath78 is not an absorbing state , and our model exhibits no absorbing transition which was studied in a symmetric exclusion process with varying length @xcite",
    ".    distributions of simulation samples for various initial lengths is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : variousl0](a , b ) .",
    "we observe that the samples starting from a short queue tend to remain short .",
    "more samples starting from a long queue tend to grow .",
    "the growth of each of them is almost proportional to time @xmath3 as well as their average , see fig .",

    "distributions of @xmath63 simulation samples , and ( b ) behavior of @xmath79 averaged over diverging samples , with parameters .",
    "the samples started from various initial lengths at density @xmath80 . in ( a )",
    "the samples are divided into three groups according to @xmath81 or @xmath82 at time @xmath83 .",
    "the lengths of bands represent the ratio of the number of samples classified into each group .",
    "the plots of the number of samples at @xmath84 are given in ( b ) .",
    "the plots in ( c ) are given by averaging over samples that have never hit @xmath78 within @xmath85 . ]",
    "let us consider the first passage time @xcite , i.e. the first time @xmath86 when a sample hits the length @xmath87 , starting from @xmath58 .",
    "we observe that the average first passage time becomes very large as @xmath12 increases [ fig .",
    "[ fig : hit ] ( a ) ] , and it seems to increase faster than power law .",
    "thus it is impossible to reach e.g. @xmath88 in our computer simulations , even though the probability of _ ever _ hitting the length @xmath89 is 1 . in this sense ,",
    "the ergodicity of the eqp - lk is _ effectively _ broken .",
    "the difficulty of reaching @xmath89 is also implied by fig .",
    "[ fig : hit ] ( b ) , where the average first passage time becomes extremely large as @xmath90 decreases .",
    "( when samples visit @xmath91 for the first time ) vs @xmath12 .",
    "the parameters were chosen as in eqn .   with initial length @xmath58 .",

    "the mechanism underlying the effective ergodicity breaking can be qualitatively understood in terms of a random walk model .",
    "the position of the walker corresponds to the system length @xmath12 and the random walk has one reflecting end corresponding to @xmath13 .",
    "we denote the hopping probabilities by @xmath105 for @xmath106 and by @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "the behavior of the length of the eqp - lk can be qualitatively modeled by hopping probabilities that satisfy @xmath109 with some @xmath110 . in other words ,",
    "the potential @xcite @xmath111 takes a maximum at @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] .",
    "one of the simplest examples is the case where @xmath114 with some @xmath115 .",
    "the walker tends to move towards @xmath13 when it is on a position @xmath116 .",
    "oppositely a walker on @xmath117 tends to move towards @xmath118 .",
    "this inhomogeneous bias corresponds to the length dependence of the langmuir probability ; when the system length is short , a newly entering particle at the left end , which would increase the length , can easily be removed . on the other hand , in a long queue this effect",
    "is weak since @xmath119 .",
    "therefore the initial condition and initial behavior are very important .",
    "once the walker reaches @xmath13 , it can not easily escape .",
    "it then fluctuates near @xmath13 , but this is not a true stationary state .",
    "we remark that one can easily prove that there is no stationary distribution , and the walker s position should diverge in the long - time limit .",
    "thus the random walk model exhibits qualitatively the same behavior as observed in the eqp - lk ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : l0350 ] and [ fig : variousl0 ] ) .    ) .",
    "when the walker is on a position @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) , it prefers to go to @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath118 ) . ]",
    "we have analyzed a queueing model with excluded - volume effect and langmuir kinetics by simulations .",
    "due to the varying length of the system , the langmuir probabilities depend on the current state in each simulation run , which has a significant influence on the dynamics , e.g. a strong dependence on the initial condition and effective ergodicity breaking .",
    "there is a phase where long queues ( @xmath117 ) prefer to grow , whereas short queues ( @xmath116 ) prefer to remain short , although full identification of such regime has not yet been completed @xcite .",
    "the eqp - lk shows that stochastic systems on fluctuating geometries can exhibit surprising behavior .",
    "we believe that beyond the theoretical interest our findings could be relevant for the interpretation of experimental ( where the number of samples is necessarily finite ) results as well , especially in biological systems .",
