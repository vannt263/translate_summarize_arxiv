    "uniform convergence to the viscosity solution of monotone finite element methods was shown by jensen and the first author in @xcite through an extension of the barles  souganidis framework , along with strong convergence results in @xmath8 under nondegeneracy assumptions .",
    "an alternative approach to the numerical solution of hjb equations was proposed in @xcite , based on the cordes condition which comes from the study of nondivergence form elliptic and parabolic equations with discontinuous coefficients @xcite .",
    "the cordes condition is an algebraic assumption on the coefficients of the operators @xmath6 ; it is well - suited for numerical analysis since the techniques of analysis of the continuous problem can be extended to the discrete setting .",
    "moreover , hjb equations are connected to the cordes condition through the fact that linearisations of the nonlinear operator are nondivergence form operators with discontinuous coefficients . unlike their divergence",
    "form counterparts , linear nondivergence form equations with discontinuous coefficients are generally ill - posed , even under uniform ellipticity or parabolicity conditions @xcite ; however , well - posedness is recovered under the cordes condition @xcite .",

    "this work extends our previous results to parabolic hjb equations by combining the spatial discretisation of @xcite with a discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) time - stepping scheme @xcite .",
    "the resulting method is consistent , unconditionally stable and arbitrarily high - order , whilst permitting rather general unstructured meshes and time partitions .",
    "although other time - stepping schemes could be considered , schtzau and schwab showed in @xcite that a key feature of dg time - stepping methods is the potential for exponential convergence rates , even for solutions with limited regularity ; our numerical experiments below show that our method retains this quality .    in order to treat the nonlinearity of the hjb operator ,",
    "the time - stepping scheme is nonstandard and leads to strong control of a discrete @xmath12-type norm . the consistency and good stability properties of the resulting method lead to optimal convergence rates in terms of the mesh size @xmath13 , time - interval length @xmath14 , and temporal polynomial degrees @xmath15 .",
    "the rates in the spatial polynomial degrees @xmath16 are possibly suboptimal by an order and a half , as is common for dgfem that are stable in discrete @xmath9-norms , such as dgfem for biharmonic equations @xcite .",
