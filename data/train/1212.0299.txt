    "edc fits in gsg used fixed values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the experimental data that helped fix these values are the arpes data taken up to very high binding energy ( ref .  8) .",
    "using such data it was possible to find the quasi - particle dispersion renormalization ratio due to the high energy arpes `` kink , '' @xmath22 .",
    "it was also possible to fix @xmath76 , by taking it to have the same form as the tight - binding band dispersion well - known in the literature , which was scaled to give the correct bandwidth measured by the arpes data .",
    "this left only two free fit parameters , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "of these two , @xmath77 is the impurity scattering parameter , which we associated with the effective sample quality probed by the arpes technique under different conditions ; it is determined in practice by the width of the sharpest quasi - particle peak of a given data set , @xmath79 ev for data taken with low energy photons ( e.g. , from laser ) and 3 or 4 times greater for data taken with high energy photons at synchrotrons .",
    "thus , the only intrinsic fit parameter was @xmath23 , which was determined from fits as @xmath80 ev .",
    "then , through a theoretical constraint equation , @xmath81 ev was determined .",
    "gsg were able to successfully interpret @xmath78 and @xmath82 as the purely electronic high and low arpes kink energy scales , respectively ( fig .  5 of gsg ) .",
    "this interpretation provided these two energy scale parameters with their physical meanings . in the current work",
    ", we use the values of all of the intrinsic parameters ( @xmath83 ) without change from gsg , as we found that all fits were stable under small variations of these parameters .",
    "however , small variations of @xmath32 were necessary , as described in the next section .",
    "the key information on the one electron dispersion relation , @xmath76 , is provided in the main text as circle symbols in fig .",
    "3(a ) . here",
    ", we provide more detailed information . for all fits",
    "reported in this work , @xmath76 could be approximated as a line , @xmath84 , due to the small energy range and the momentum range involved , as far as @xmath76 is concerned .",
    "we found that the model - dependent variation on @xmath41 was required in order for the fits to describe experimental peak positions correctly . for fitting the bi2212 data , @xmath85 5.5 ( ) and 6.3 eva ( , ) .",
    "3(a ) , @xmath32 values for fits are shown .",
    "for fitting the lsco data in fig .  4 , @xmath85 4 ( ) , 5 ( ) , and 5.5 eva ( ) were used .",
    "this variation in @xmath41 is consistent with the amount of uncertainty in knowing the precise band width ( ref .",
    "8) ; it implies small additional uncertainties for the intrinsic parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath26 , relative to those discussed in the previous section .",
    "in the main text , we focused on the 180 k data of bi2212 . here , we show that the arpes data at 91 k , right at @xmath86 , of this material , is described equally well by the model .",

    "[ fig - bi2212mdc-91k ] shows that the model describes the mdcs the best , while the other two models come significantly short .",

    "[ fig - bi2212 - 91k - weights ] shows the 91 k data as an image , and also shows the overall scale factors , @xmath87 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath46 as a function of @xmath8 , as extracted from mdc fits and edc fits , respectively . in great agreement with fig .  3 , we see that the model implies the most reasonable trend for the matrix element .",
    "all of these findings are in complete agreement with those findings based on the 180 k data , discussed in the main text .",
    "note , however , that 91 k is the transition temperature of this material .",
    "as the ecfl theory is the theory of the normal state , there is a reason to doubt or question the applicability of the model at very low energies at this temperature .",
    "for instance , the rather noticeable discrepancy between the theory mdc and the measured mdc at @xmath44 , as can be noticed in fig .",
    "[ fig - bi2212mdc-91k](c ) , may be related to the inadequate nature of the theory at low energies for temperatures close to , or below , the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "we discuss related issues in more detail in the next section .",
    "in fig .  [ figf](a ) , we report the quality of the mdc fits shown in fig .",
    "4 , using the standard @xmath88 measure of the line shape fit .",
    "perfectly consistent with figs .",
    "4(c  e ) , we see that the @xmath88 values for the model is much too high compared to the @xmath88 values for the two models .",
    "this lends a definite support to the model .",
    "however , which model is better ?        as fig .",
    "[ figf](a ) shows , the @xmath88 value is smaller for the model at low energy ( @xmath89 ev ) , while it is smaller for the model for ( @xmath90 ev ) .",
    "so , our question above can be rephrased as `` which of these two facts is more significant ? ''",
    "the answer is the latter , since the theory that we are applying here is applicable only to physics in the high temperature scale or the high energy ( @xmath91 ) scale .",
    "when we examine the low temperature data , and compare the data with the theory for the normal state at high temperature , our primary concern must be focused on the high energy ( @xmath91 ) behavior .     per point for the three models used for the line shape analysis of lsco ( 25k ) in fig .",

    "[ figf](b ) , we show a plot taken from a reference , given in the caption .",
    "this plot shows that the fwhm values of the arpes data are nearly temperature independent at high energy , @xmath93 ev .",
    "this is due to the fact that the high energy data taken at low temperatures are essentially identical with the high energy data taken at high temperatures .",
    "this fact justifies our use of the low temperature data in fig .",
    "it also guides us importantly to assess the relative merits of the two models , and , for the lsco data .",
    "focusing on high energy , we conclude that the model is much better , as its @xmath88 value is several times smaller than that for at high energy @xmath90 ev ( fig .",
    "[ figf](a ) ) .",
    "this does not mean that we do not need to study the high temperature data for lsco .",
    "on the contrary , the current lack of the high temperature data for lsco in view of our current result makes the study of high temperature arpes data for lsco a very attractive topic . in view of the success of the ecfl model , the strong temperature dependence predicted at high temperatures ( fig .",
    "5(f ) of gsg ) , and the apparent difference between the lsco data and the bi2212 data , the investigation of the high temperature arpes line shapes for lsco may be an excellent topic of research in the near future .",
    "lastly , note that at low temperatures , the low energy arpes peak is significantly sharper than our theoretical model predicts , as the mdc comparison at @xmath44 in fig .",
    "4(b ) or fig .",
    "[ fig - bi2212mdc-91k](c ) shows .",
    "this seems consistent with the general notion that the onset of the superconducting gap ( or pseudo - gap ) reduces the decay channels for quasi - particles .",
    "both the model and the model agree with the model , when small energy range and small momentum range are considered , as the edc fits of figs .  1 and [ fig - bi2212edc-91k ] show .",
    "a more quantitative analysis can be made about this fact , as follows .",
    "as long as the caparison factor defined in eq .  4 is well above zero , the model remains valid .",
    "using @xmath94 ev , determined from our fit parameters , and putting @xmath95 , the approximate quasi - particle peak position , we see that eq .",
    "4 requires @xmath96 in order for @xmath97 . here , we must take @xmath98 to be the _ total _ mass renormalization ratio , which , according to our theory , is equal to @xmath99 .",
    "putting these numbers together , we see that the model is expected to be valid for @xmath100 ev , or @xmath101 ev . noting that @xmath102 corresponds to the approximate peak position in edc",
    ", we therefore learn that the model would be good for describing edcs , when their peaks are within about 90 mev from the chemical potential .",
    "this explains why fits are very good in figs .  1 and [ fig - bi2212edc-91k ] , while this is no longer the case in fig .",
    "it is for the same reason that mdc fits by the secfl are very poor .",
    "this consideration explains excellent edc fits in gsg , justifies the simple truncation procedure , @xmath103 , employed in that work ( see fig .",
    "3(e ) also ) , and , last but not least , correctly puts models as standing in harmony with the model , not in contradiction to it .",
    "the model is useful to discuss from three points of view .",
    "first , its discussion touches upon some basic theoretical issues .",
    "second , it provides an alternative way to define the model ( see fig .",
    "3(e ) and its discussion in the main text ) .",
    "third , it provides the best model for the lsco data as shown in fig .",

    ", the non - negativity of the spectral function requires that @xmath54 , or equivalently , @xmath104 . considering @xmath105 and @xmath2 near the peak position ( @xmath106 where @xmath98 is the quasi - particle weight )",
    ", this leads to the following requirement : @xmath107 .",
    "this requirement would clearly be violated for a large value of @xmath108 , if @xmath57 were to be held constant .",
    "going beyond the approach , where @xmath109 was limited to a small value so that this violation is irrelevant ( sec .",
    "e ) , we can avoid this violation altogether , if we employ a @xmath8 or @xmath2 dependent @xmath57 . in particular , in ,",

    ", @xmath110 defines the width ( @xmath111 ) of the sigmoidal drop of @xmath112 , occurring at a position defined by @xmath51 : @xmath113 .",
    "this @xmath57 function ensures that ( 1 ) @xmath114 as @xmath115 , as well as @xmath116 , as required by the spectral weight sum rule per @xmath8 within the model , and ( 2 ) @xmath117 for _ any _ @xmath118 values , as long as @xmath119 as can be shown by a bit of algebra .      the new parameters @xmath51 and @xmath59 play the role of controlling the mdc asymmetry .",
    "before we discuss this , we must first note that , for a given value of @xmath59 , @xmath51 has both an upper bound , as just given , and a rough lower bound , @xmath120 . the lower bound arises due to the empirical fact that the edc line shape can not be fit within the afl theory , which the theory converges to ( up to an overall scale ) if @xmath121 .",
    "that is , @xmath51 can not be too small .",
    "these bounds and the line shape fit severely restrict values of @xmath51 and @xmath59 : @xmath51 lies at about -1 and @xmath59 lies at about 2 , both with a small wiggle room of about @xmath122 .        in this consideration ,",
    "the following points are worth noting .",
    "first , if @xmath128 , then converges to .",
    "this is because @xmath129 in this limit ( eq .  6 ) .",
    "second , if @xmath121 , then does _ not _ convert to , but to a `` re - weighted '' afl .",
    "this is because in this case @xmath130 and @xmath131 , giving @xmath132 , according to eqs .  3 and 4 , where @xmath133 is the green s function for the afl , as defined right after eq .",
    "so , the theory becomes that of the afl theory , in this limit , except that the total spectral weight is not 1 , but the model weight @xmath134so , a `` re - weighted '' afl .",
    "now , the model and the afl model are quite different , since the caparison factor gives a stronger edc asymmetry in the former model",
    ". however , the two models do have in common that their mdcs are completely symmetric .",
    "so , when narrowly focusing on the mdc asymmetry , we can view the three models  the model , the afl model , and the @xmath135 model  as mutually equivalent .    from this discussion ,",
    "the following can be noted for the reason why the bi2212 data are fit poorly by the model , despite more parameters afforded by it .",
    "the combination of the asymmetric edc behavior and the symmetric mdc behavior displayed by the bi2212 data pose difficulties to the model .",
    "this is because as the mdc is made more symmetric , the edc is becoming more symmetric also , contributing the degradation of the fit ( fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig - bi2212edc-91k](b ) ) .",
    "separately , the @xmath121 model gives as good an mdc fit as the model , while the @xmath126 model gives as good an edc fit as the model .",
    "the middle ground is found at @xmath48 , at which value both the edc fit and the mdc fit suffer a little .    turning to @xmath59 , fig .",
    "[ fig - mdc - a2 ] shows the dependence of the mdc line shape on @xmath59 .",
    "the two constraints  the upper bound and the lower bound of @xmath51 for a given @xmath59 value , and vice versa  discussed above mean that the range of @xmath59 shown here is nearly the full range of @xmath59 allowed ( panel b ) , or a significant fraction of it ( panel a ) , for each given value of @xmath51 .",
    "these line shape changes are of the same kind of line shape change that is controlled by @xmath51the change in the mdc asymmetry . instead of using two parameters to control the same aspect of the data , we found it sufficient to fix the value of @xmath59 at 2 , and use @xmath51 as a fit parameter to describe the mdc asymmetry .",
    "in particular , note that in panel b , which corresponds to our final @xmath51 value , the line shape depends little on @xmath59 ."

    "<S> the model accomplishes these feats _ without _ any additional fit parameter , in comparison to the model . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the success arises crucially from _ the separate treatment of the @xmath2 dependence and the @xmath8 dependence , or independence , of the caparison factor , important for describing edcs and mdcs , respectively_.    in contrast to the models , it is clear that the model can not describe mdcs at all . </S>",
    "<S> using identical fit parameters as for edcs ( see the dashed line marked `` @xmath53 ev '' in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - bi2212mdc](a ) ) , we get very poor fit quality , which improves , dramatically but insufficiently , by relaxing the @xmath24 parameter to 0.13 ev ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , so successful in the previous work @xcite , must be viewed as getting only one of the two things correct  the @xmath2 dependence of the caparison factor , but not its @xmath8 dependence  and its valid regime remains @xcite confined to edcs in the narrow range of @xmath8 around @xmath52 ( figs .  </S>",

    "<S> we argue that these phenomenological modifications require physics beyond the hamiltonian , since the model is derived @xcite from the hamiltonian , and another well - known model @xcite based on the hamiltonian also implies too asymmetric mdcs . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , the physics of the ( next nearest neighbor hopping ) @xmath67 term seems a good candidate : the well - known fact that @xmath68 is significantly smaller for lsco @xcite goes well with our result that the model is more similar to the model . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath67 term is correlated with the superconducting transition temperature @xcite , imparting importance to our current proposal . </S>",
    "<S> we recently found @xcite that an anomalous arpes feature is explained by pecfl , but not , and has similarity to a scanning tunneling spectroscopy feature correlated with superconductivity , adding more credence to our argument here . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , the fact that the caparison factor for the infinite - dimensional ecfl becomes @xmath8-independent @xcite seems to go along with our result , within the crude analogy between adding a large @xmath67 term and increasing channels for @xmath69 hopping .    in this letter , we proposed a phenomenological arpes line shape model , based on the ecfl theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the essential feature of our model remains the caparison factor @xcite , which is capable of describing both anomalous edc line shapes @xcite , universal for cuprates , and apparently more conventional mdc line shapes @xcite . while our model is not the first to fit both edcs and mdcs @xcite of cuprates , its demonstrated fidelity ( including a qualitative description of @xmath13 ) and range of applicability is now unprecedented . also unprecedented </S>",
    "<S> is the notable fact that our model requires a dyson self energy @xcite , whose form is _ drastically different from that assumed by the prevalent , but incomplete , mdc - only analysis _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : to our knowledge , ours is the only @xmath40-dependent @xcite dyson self energy that has fit cuprate mdcs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , extending the current analysis to wider ranges of momentum , doping , and temperature and studying its implication on other properties such as the resistivity @xcite seems to make a great research topic for the immediate future .    </S>",
