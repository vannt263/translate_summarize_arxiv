    "<S> understanding the electronic properties of dopants near an interface is a critical challenge for nano - scale devices . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the effect of dielectric mismatch and quantum confinement on the ionization energy of individual acceptors beneath a hydrogen passivated silicon ( 100 ) surface . whilst dielectric mismatch between the vacuum and the silicon at the interface results in an image charge which enhances the binding energy of sub - surface acceptors , quantum confinement is shown to reduce the binding energy . using scanning tunneling spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> we measure resonant transport through the localized states of individual acceptors . </S>",
    "<S> thermal broadening of the conductance peaks provides a direct measure for the absolute energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> our data unambiguously demonstrates that these two independent effects compete with the result that the ionization energy is less than 5  mev lower than the bulk value for acceptors less than a bohr radius from the interface . </S>"
