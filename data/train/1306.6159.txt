    "<S> the mixed mode contribution ( shown by black dashed line ) has a pronounced maximum near btrs phase transition where the mixed mode becomes massless . </S>",
    "<S> the viscosity however still remains finite even at the critical point due to the anharmonism in eqs.([eq : system ] ) which provides a power - law decay for the phase - density mode contribution to viscosity as well as to the vortex energy . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional tinkham and bardeen- stephen contributions are monotonic functions of @xmath30 . summing up all contributions we find that here the behavior of the total viscosity is dominated by the mixed mode near the btrs transition . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown by solid red line which features a pronounced peak . </S>",
    "<S> this anomalous behavior is realized for vortex structures belonging to branch 2 with btrs either in the bulk at @xmath128 or in the vortex core at @xmath51 . on the other hand vortex solution without btrs corresponding to the branch 1 </S>",
    "<S> has monotonic viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> comparing figs.[fig : order1]b and [ fig : order1]d one can see that the vortex energy and viscosity behave rather similar as functions of @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we reported a new mechanism contributing to vortex viscosity in btrs superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the results are generic for btrs superconductors with mode mixing . in particular </S>",
    "<S> it is not specific to three - band superconductor but should also apply to btrs states with different number of bands or different interband frustration which exhibit mode mixing ( some of which were discussed in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to a pronounced anomaly at the phase transition where time reversal symmetry is broken . </S>",
    "<S> thus one can potentially observe this phase transition by measuring the anomalous behavior of both thermodynamic properties ( vortex energy @xmath129 determines the lower critical field @xmath130 ) and transport properties such as flux flow resistance which is determined by vortex viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> it can be utilized to detect possible @xmath25 state in @xmath0 .    </S>",
