    "the existence of very strong magnetic fields in the atmosphere of neutron stars @xmath9 g ( @xmath10a.u . )   a.u . @xmath11  g@xmath12  t. ] and magnetars @xmath13 g ( @xmath14a.u . ) has posed different questions about the structure of matter under the influence of such extreme magnetic fields ( see for a review e.g. @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", it raised the question about the possible atomic and molecular systems which can exist in a strong magnetic field : can molecular chains be formed ?",
    "the interest in getting answers to these questions dramatically increased after the long - expected discoveries made by chandra and xmm - newton @xmath15-ray observatories of absorption features in the soft x - ray spectra of several magnetic stars .",
    "the first of that was the celebrated 2002 findings in the radiation coming from the isolated neutron star 1e1207.4 - 5209 of two wide absorption features at @xmath160.7  kev and @xmath171.4  kev @xcite .",
    "one of possible explanations of these features might be the presence of the traditional @xmath18 and the exotic @xmath19 @xcite molecular ions in the atmosphere of this neutron star @xcite .",
    "it is one of the reasons to assume that other traditional and exotic systems - atomic and/or molecular , containing one or more electrons - might be present in the atmosphere of the neutron stars and magnetars .",
    "it has recently been predicted that a variety of hydrogenic , helium and mixed hydrogen / helium molecular ions of one and two electrons can be formed when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is imposed @xcite .",
    "it is already known that the simplest molecular ion @xmath18 exists for all magnetic fields , while two more one - electron exotic ions @xmath20 and @xmath21 might begin to exist for magnetic fields @xmath22a.u .  and @xmath23a.u .",
    ", respectively ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , for magnetic fields @xmath24 a.u .  the exotic compound @xmath20 becomes the most bound one - electron system among the one - electron hydrogenic - helium ions .",
    "then , a natural question arises : can other one - electron two - center systems @xmath25 exist in a strong magnetic field ?",
    "a simple electrostatic analysis indicates that this is indeed possible for @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of the present work is to study the existence of lithium - containing ions @xmath27 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "the relativistic corrections are assumed to be of a small importance for @xmath28  a.u .  following the analysis by duncan @xcite that the longitudinal electronic motion is still deeply non - relativistic .",
    "the molecular axis is assumed to be aligned parallel to the magnetic field line since it is rather evident that this configuration is optimal if a magnetic field is sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "the positively - charged centers are considered to be infinitely heavy ( zero - order born - oppenheimer approximation ) .",
    "we use two methods .",
    "the _ variational method _ with physically relevant trial functions and the _ lagrange - mesh method_. the first one has been proven to be very efficient @xcite with physically motivated trial functions . on the other hand , the _ lagrange - mesh method _",
    "@xcite nowadays provides the most accurate results for the total energy of the @xmath18 ion .",
    "however , in practice , the implementation of the lagrange - mesh method is made easier with an _ a priori _ knowledge of the equilibrium distance and the corresponding total energy .",
    "our approach is the following : as a first step we use the _ variational method _ to obtain preliminary but already sufficiently accurate results for the equilibrium distance and the total energy and then the _ lagrange - mesh method _",
    "is used to check and possibly improve the variational results .",
    "atomic units @xmath29 are used throughout , although the energy is given in rydbergs .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes two infinitely heavy centers of charges @xmath30 and @xmath31 situated along the @xmath32 axis , and one electron placed in a uniform constant magnetic field directed along the @xmath33axis , @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 ( for geometrical setting see figure  [ fig : lix ] , the origin of the coordinate system is the middle point between the nuclei for all molecular ions considered here ) . the vector potential corresponding to a constant magnetic field @xmath36 is chosen in the symmetric gauge @xmath37 then the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the @xmath32-component of the electron orbital momentum , which is a constant of motion . in practice , we consider the charges @xmath41 and @xmath42 for lithium - containing ions",
    ".    for the case of unequally charged centers the only integral of motion apart from the energy is the angular momentum projection @xmath43 on the magnetic field direction , and the eigenstates are labeled by a quantum number corresponding to the excitation , and a greek letter @xmath44 corresponding to the magnetic quantum number @xmath45 , respectively . in the equilibrium configuration",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ ham - lix ] ) with equal charges ( @xmath46 ) are characterized by two integrals of motion : @xmath43 and the spatial parity operator @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) with eigenvalues @xmath49 .",
    "the parallel symmetric configuration is also characterized by the @xmath32-parity , @xmath50 with eigenvalues @xmath51 .",
    "the magnetic quantum number @xmath52 , spatial parity @xmath53 and @xmath32-parity @xmath54 are related by @xmath55 thus , any eigenstate has two definite quantum numbers : @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "therefore the space of eigenstates is split into subspaces ( sectors ) each of them characterized by definite @xmath52 and @xmath54 , or @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "notation involves the subscript @xmath56 ( gerade / ungerade ) corresponding to positive / negative eigenvalues of the spatial parity operator @xmath47 .     and @xmath31 placed in a magnetic field @xmath57 in parallel configuration along the @xmath32-axis .",
    "@xmath58 is the internuclear distance and @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the distances between the electron and the charged centers @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively.,height=188 ]",
    "we first study the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ ham - lix ] ) by means of the variational method . we follow the general recipe for the choice of physically relevant trial functions presented in @xcite . for the case of unequal charged centers we use a trial function of a similar form to the one used to study the @xmath21 molecular ion in a strong magnetic field ( see @xcite ) , @xmath61 with @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 are variational parameters . considering the internuclear distance @xmath58 as a variational parameter",
    ", we have in total @xmath66 variational parameters ( a free normalization of the trial function ( [ psi - z1z2 ] ) allows us to keep fixed one of the parameters @xmath63 ) .    for the case of symmetric systems with equal charges",
    "@xmath67 we use a ground state trial function which was successfully used to explore the @xmath68 and @xmath20 molecular ions in a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it has the same form ( [ psi - z1z2 ] ) with permutationally - symmetric functions ( [ psitr1:z1z2]-[psitr3:z1z2 ] ) , @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 are variational parameters .",
    "here we end up with ten variational parameters .",
    "the functions @xmath73 describe the coherent and incoherent interactions of the electron with the charged centers , respectively .",
    "obviously , they are suitable modifications of the celebrated heitler - london and hund - mulliken @xmath68-trial functions by multiplication with the lowest landau orbital . in turn , the function @xmath74 is a modified guillemin - zener function . it can be also considered as a non - linear superposition of the functions @xmath73 .      with the aim to confirm and improve the variational results , we apply the lagrange - mesh method @xcite which is an approximate variational calculation performed with the lagrange basis and simplified by the use of the corresponding gauss quadrature .",
    "so far , this method gives the most accurate total energy of @xmath68-ion in a magnetic field .",
    "the implementation of this method is made easier with an _ a priori _ knowledge of the equilibrium configuration and the total energy of the system .",
    "thus , the variational results obtained for all studied systems @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 can serve as input information for the lagrange - mesh method .    in order to study a two - center molecular system of charges @xmath30 and @xmath31 it is adequate to use the spheroidal coordinates @xmath75 defined as @xmath76 ( see figure[fig : lix ] ) with @xmath77 , @xmath78 and the azimuthal angle @xmath79 .",
    "since the @xmath32-projection of the orbital angular momentum @xmath43 commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ ham - lix ] ) , it is replaced by its eigenvalue @xmath52 ( magnetic quantum number ) . because we are interested by the ground state , the wave function should be nodeless , hence @xmath80 and it can be written as  @xcite @xmath81 making a substitution of ( [ functot ] ) into the schr@xmath82dinger equation for the hamiltonian ( [ ham - lix ] ) , we arrive at the differential equation for the ground state function @xmath83 , @xmath84 \\psi_{0}(\\xi,\\eta ) = e \\,\\psi_{0}(\\xi,\\eta)\\,,\\ ] ] with the effective potential @xmath85 where @xmath86 here @xmath87 we consider @xmath83 spanned in some finite basis @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the size in the @xmath90-direction and @xmath91 is in the @xmath92-direction , respectively .",

    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath103 is introduced for convenience . making its variation , it allows us to adapt the lagrange mesh to the actual size of the molecular ion . taking the wave function ( [ wavef ] ) and using the gaussian quadratures associated to each coordinate , the equation ( [ schr0 ] ) gets the form of mesh equations ( see @xcite ) @xmath104c_{i'j'}=0\\ , .",

    "the potential @xmath106 is evaluated at the zeros of the laguerre ( scaled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath103 ) and legendre polynomials .",
    "finally , the problem of solving the schr@xmath82dinger equation is reduced to searching eigenvalues of the matrix equation ( [ matrixe ] ) .",
    "the results of the variational and mesh calculations for the @xmath80 ground state of the lithium - containing one - electron coulomb systems @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in magnetic fields @xmath107a.u . in parallel configuration are presented in tables [ lit : atom ] , [ tlili ] , [ tlihe ] , and [ tlih ] , respectively .",
