    "heavy electron materials have long been the subject of extensive investigation , for reviews see e.g.  @xcite . yet in many respects even their ` normal ' paramagnetic phase , be it metallic or insulating , has eluded a unified microscopic description on all experimentally relevant temperature ( @xmath4 ) and/or frequency ( @xmath5 ) scales .",
    "the canonical theoretical model here is of course the periodic anderson model ( pam ) . within the general framework of dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite we have developed in the preceding paper  @xcite ( here referred to as i ) a non - perturbative local moment approach to paramagnetic metallic phases of the pam , with a focus on d.c .  transport and optics ; following earlier work on @xmath6 dynamics  @xcite and on kondo insulators  @xcite .",
    "the primary emphasis of i is the kondo lattice regime relevant to strong correlated heavy fermion ( hf ) metals .",
    "dynamics / transport on all relevant ( @xmath7)-scales are encompassed , from the low - energy behaviour characteristic of the lattice coherent fermi liquid , through incoherent effective single - impurity physics to non - universal high - energy scales .",
    "the underlying theory is not however restricted to the kondo lattice regime , enabling it also to handle e.g.  intermediate valence ( iv ) behaviour .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to provide at least a partial answer to the question : to what extent are the optical and d.c .",
    "transport properties of hf and related materials captured by the pam and our theory for it ? that clearly requires direct , quantitative comparison between theory and experiment , which is our purpose here .",
    "specifically , we consider in detail the transport and optics of four materials : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , all hf metals with the exception of the iv compound @xmath9 , and exhibiting a diverse range of behaviour in their transport and optical behaviour .",
    "the materials are analysed on a case by case basis in  s 3 - 6 , following a discussion (  2 ) of relevant issues involved in making the comparison ; and we believe it fair to claim that the theory provides a striking account of experiment .",
    "the hamiltonian for the pam is given by equation ( 2.1 ) of i , and its physical content is simple : a single correlated @xmath12-level in each unit cell hybridizes locally to an uncorrelated conduction band .",
    "the model is moreover specified by only four ` bare'/material parameters rendering it minimalist in terms of comparison to experiment  the more so when one recalls that it encompasses regimes of behaviour as diverse as strongly correlated heavy fermion metals and kondo insulators , intermediate valence , and weak coupling .",
    "the dimensionless bare parameters are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( in units of the conduction electron hopping , @xmath17 ) , with @xmath13 denoting the local @xmath12-level interaction strength and @xmath14 the local one - electron hybridization coupling an @xmath12-level to the conduction band .",
    "the energy of the local conduction orbital , @xmath18 , determines the centre of gravity of the free conduction band relative to the fermi level ( and thereby the conduction band filling , @xmath19 ) ; and @xmath16 denotes the @xmath12-orbital energy .",
    "an equivalent parameter set is @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 specifies the @xmath12-level asymmetry .",
    "the non - interacting limit of the model ( @xmath22 ) is certainly trivial .",
    "but in that case  for _ all _ @xmath4  the d.c .",
    "resistivity of the metallic state vanishes , and the optical conductivity contains no absorption below the direct gap save for a @xmath23-function drude contribution at @xmath24 , see i. that this behaviour bears scant comparison to experiment reflects the fact that the essential physics is driven by scattering due to electron interactions .",
    "it is of course the latter , and the resultant many - body nature of the problem , that renders the pam non - trivial .    in considering d.c .",
    "transport , the first requirement in comparing theory to experiment is thus to extract the contribution ( @xmath25 ) to the measured resistivity ( @xmath26 ) that isolates the interaction contributions from those of phonons and static impurity scattering .",
    "this is given , ideally , by @xmath27 the first term removes the residual ( @xmath6 ) resistivity , and hence impurity scattering contribution on the assumption that the latter is @xmath4-independent .",
    "the second removes the contribution from phonons ; usually taken in practice ( as assumed in the following ) to be the resistivity of the non - magnetic homologue compound with the magnetic ion @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) replaced by @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) , on the assumption that interactions in the latter are negligible .",
    "for most systems the phonon contribution is generally negligible for @xmath32 or so .    while this prescription is straightforward in principle , we first deal with a complication that can arise in practice .",
    "experimentally it is the resistance that is measured directly . to convert to a sample independent resistivity requires spatial dimensions to be known with reasonable precision .",
    "that does not pose a problem with large crystals , but may do for small samples .",
    "examples arise in the literature where reported @xmath26 s from different groups differ quite significantly ; we encounter one such in the case of @xmath11 considered in  6 .",
    "absolute resistivities would thus be related to measured values by e.g.  @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote experimental ` mismatch ' factors . for comparison to theory ( equation ( 2.2 ) below )",
    "we require however only the relative factors @xmath37 , to which end we replace the above by _",
    "mag^exp(t ) = a\\{(t)-(0 ) } - _ ph(t ) where @xmath38 in the ideal case ( the majority of systems considered below ) .",
    "the experimental @xmath25 is to be compared to @xmath39 arising from the theory of i for the pam ( where @xmath40 was denoted simply by @xmath41 ) .",
    "the system is generically characterized by a low - energy coherence scale @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the quasiparticle weight or inverse mass renormalization factor .",
    "this scale is a complicated function of the underlying bare parameters , see e.g.  @xcite and refs therein .",
    "but in the strong coupling kondo lattice regime @xmath44 is exponentially small ( because @xmath43 is ) . in consequence",
    ", @xmath39 exhibits scaling in terms of @xmath44 , i.e.  is of form _",
    "mag(t ) = h ( ) with the temperature dependence encoded in @xmath45 , _ independent _ of the interaction strength @xmath13 and hybridization @xmath14 ( @xmath46 is a trivial overall scale factor , @xmath47 in the notation of i ) ; the scaling holding for ( any ) fixed @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "the scaling resistivity is moreover only weakly dependent on @xmath20 , and for @xmath48 or so is in fact independent of @xmath18 , reflecting the crossover to incoherent effective single impurity physics ( as detailed in i , see e.g.  figure 8) .",
    "this enables direct connection to experiment , via the extent to which the scaling form equation ( 2.2 ) captures the @xmath4-dependence of experimental resistivities ; and indeed also their pressure dependence , for although @xmath44 will change with pressure the scaling behaviour should remain intact ( we consider this explicitly in the case of @xmath2 ,  5 ) . success in this regard also enables @xmath44 to be determined directly , there being no hope of calculating it ` ab initio ' with any meaningful accuracy . finally , we add that comparison of theory / experiment proceeds along the same lines away from the asymptotic kondo lattice regime , in dealing e.g.  with intermediate valence materials or intermediate / weak coupling compounds . here a full parameter set @xmath18 , @xmath20 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 must in general be specified ; but @xmath39 can always be cast in the form equation ( 2.2 ) , and appropriate comparison can be made .",
    "although our comments above focus on static transport , a central purpose of the paper is also to make direct comparison between experiment and theory for optics , on all experimentally relevant frequency and temperature scales . given prior analysis of d.c .",
    "transport , the underlying model / material parameters are known , either wholly or in part .",
    "there is then little room for manoeuvre ; the resultant theory either captures the optical behaviour or not , providing a further and quite stringent test of the model s material applicability .",
    "the main physical effect omitted in the pam itself is that of crystal electric fields ( cefs ) .",
    "the atomic levels of e.g.  @xmath49 , @xmath50 , are generically split into three doublets , the excited levels lying above the ground state by @xmath51 , @xmath52 . for sufficiently low @xmath4 only the lowest level matters , it being this alone the pam seeks to capture .",
    "although the material specific @xmath53 are usually larger than @xmath44 ( itself typically @xmath54 ) , they often lie in the interval @xmath55 .",
    "their qualitative influence on d.c.transport is clear , for additional conduction channels are opened up in accessing higher cef levels with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "quantitatively however , the effect is hard to gauge _ a priori _ , its magnitude naturally depending on how effectively the higher cef levels couple to the conduction band .",
    "where present and effective , we can expect to see it as a decrease in the experimental resistivity below that predicted by the 1-channel pam , the onset of the deviation appearing at @xmath56 .",
    "we add here that while the role of cef effects has been studied in the context of _",
    "single_-impurity anderson / kondo models  @xcite , with application to lattice - based systems for sufficiently high temperatures where lattice coherence can be neglected , we are not aware of corresponding work in the context of lattice - fermion models .    finally , we note that our comparison of theory / experiment for kondo insulators in  @xcite was free from most of the considerations above . there , theory was compared directly to the experimental @xmath26 , for several reasons .",
    "first , in contrast to the case of heavy fermion metals , resistivities of the non - magnetic homologues are sufficiently small compared to those of the kondo insulating material that @xmath57 in equation ( 2.1 ) can be neglected with impunity .",
    "that in turn means that any sample geometry factor @xmath58 in equation ( 2.1 ) can simply be absorbed into the overall scale factor @xmath46 ( equation ( 2.2 ) ) , so any lack of precision in obtaining @xmath26 is immaterial .",
    "the role of impurities is also different in kondo insulators . in metals",
    "this arises from static impurity scattering , presumed to be @xmath4-independent and generating the finite residual resistivity @xmath59 ; which is thus subtracted out as in equation ( 2.1 ) . in kondo insulators",
    "by contrast @xmath26 diverges as @xmath60 , reflecting the insulating ground state .",
    "this occurs even in the presence of localized impurity states in the @xmath6 insulating gap ; which generate conduction by variable - range hopping , generally operative over a narrow @xmath4-interval ( e.g.  @xmath61 for @xmath62  @xcite ) , and whose net effect on @xmath26 at temperatures above this interval ( where direct comparison is made to experiment ) is usually sufficiently small to be neglected .",
    "we turn now to comparison with experiment for the metallic heavy fermion and intermediate valence materials considered .",
    "among the rare - earth hexaborides , the kondo insulator @xmath63 and the heavy fermion compound @xmath0 have been investigated for many years  @xcite .",
    "the former was considered in our recent work  @xcite on the particle - hole symmetric pam .",
    "there it was shown that a single low - energy ( indirect gap ) scale underlies the temperature dependence of both the static and optical conductivity , and ( with minimal input of bare material parameters ) the frequency dependence of the optics as well . here",
    "we consider its metallic counterpart @xmath0 , likewise a cubic system  @xcite . at the lowest temperatures , various antiferromagnetic phase transitions",
    "occur between @xmath64  @xcite ; above ( and below ) which the paramagnetic phase arises , ` phase - i ' for @xmath65 .",
    "the relative ease with which large , clean single crystals of @xmath0 can be grown ( see e.g.  @xcite ) has been a motivating factor in its investigation .",
    "the d.c .",
    "resistivity has been measured by several groups ( e.g.  @xcite ) and since the sample quality is in general good , the residual resistivity is very small .",
    "in addition , the relatively large crystal sizes imply small errors in sample geometry , hence the factor @xmath66 in equations ( 2.1 ) can safely be assumed to be 1 . the phonon contribution to",
    "the resistivity is as usual taken as the resistivity of the non - magnetic homologue @xmath67  @xcite , the latter having the same lattice structure with similar lattice parameters and phonon dispersion as @xmath8 ( from inelastic neutron scattering  @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental magnetic resistivity @xmath25 is then readily obtained  @xcite , and shown in figure 1 ( we add that the phonon contribution kicks in only for @xmath68 , so the magnetic resistivity essentially coincides with the raw resistivity at lower temperatures ) .",
    "a small kink arises in @xmath25 at @xmath69 , reflecting the transition from paramagnetic phase i to phase ii  @xcite mentioned above .",
    "the experimental resistivity is seen to exhicoverletter   fig4.eps iopart10.clo paper.tex replyletter   bit the classic ` shape ' for a strongly correlated hf metal , increasing from zero at @xmath6 and going through a coherence peak at @xmath70 , before decreasing through a small log - linear regime ( similar to that shown in figure 6(a ) of i ) to a shallow minimum at @xmath71 ; increasing thereafter at higher temperatures where it shows conventional metallic behaviour .",
    "to compare @xmath25 to theory , first recall from i that the asymptotic scaling resistivity @xmath39 is a universal function of @xmath45 for fixed @xmath18 and @xmath20 ( being independent of the local interaction @xmath13 and hybridization @xmath14 ) ; see e.g.  figure 8 of i. for a chosen @xmath72 the scaling @xmath39 is then straightforwardly superposed onto @xmath25 with an appropriate rescaling of the temperature and resistivity axes , thus enabling the low - energy scale @xmath44 to be determined .",
    "the asymptotic scaling @xmath39 is shown in figure 1 ( dotted line ) for a moderate @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with the resultant coherence scale thereby found to be @xmath75 .",
    "it is seen to capture the experimental resistivity up to @xmath76 , but above this it deviates below experiment , continuing as it must to decrease monotonically ( see figure 8 of i ) and hence lacking the minimum occurring experimentally for @xmath8 at @xmath77 , i.e.   @xmath78 .    as discussed in i ( figure 8 inset ) ,",
    "the latter behaviour is physically natural and readily encompassed theoretically .",
    "no real hf material is in the universal scaling regime ` for ever '  it must be exited sooner or later with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "deviation of @xmath39 from its asymptotic scaling form at sufficiently high temperatures signifies the onset of non - universality ; and the location of the non - universal minimum in @xmath39 provides an opportunity to identify the ratio @xmath79 of effective bare material parameters , which will be helpful in making a prediction for the @xmath80-dependence of the optical conductivity @xmath81 .",
    "specifically , for the chosen @xmath82 , we find that the theoretical @xmath39 indeed has a minimum at @xmath83 ( as in experiment ) for @xmath84 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 , where we show the resultant theoretical @xmath39 for @xmath85 ( solid curve ) and @xmath86 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the two @xmath39 s barely differ from the asymptotic scaling resistivity for @xmath87 , are essentially coincident with each other across the entire @xmath4-range , and each possesses a weak minimum at @xmath88 . except naturally for a small neighbourhood around the low - temperature phase transitions ( which the theory does not seek to address ) , the resultant theoretical @xmath39 is seen to be in rather good agreement with experiment , as evident further from the inset to figure 1 where the corresponding d.c.conductivity @xmath89 is shown .",
    "a cef excitation is known to occur at @xmath90 ( @xmath91 )  @xcite ( with a second lying at a much higher energy , @xmath92  @xcite ) ; but as judged from the above comparison this appears to play a minor role in the d.c .",
    "transport itself .    to determine the optical conductivity on all @xmath5-scales , including non - universal frequencies ,",
    "requires @xmath13 and @xmath93 to be separately specified as discussed in i. that is clearly not provided by the above analysis , but a reasoned prediction for @xmath81 may nonetheless be made . for fixed @xmath84 as above , we find that varying @xmath13 across the range @xmath94 produces only a modest change in both the @xmath5- and @xmath4-dependence of @xmath81 , leading in particular to a direct gap absorption lying in the interval @xmath95 ; as well as a quasiparticle weight @xmath43 on the order of @xmath96 that is consistent with the effective mass @xmath97 @xmath98 deduced from the specific heat coefficient @xmath99 measured for phase - i of @xmath8  @xcite . in otherwords , on the assumption that the reasonably wide @xmath13-range above encompasses the behaviour of @xmath8 , the optics are relatively insensitive to the precise value of @xmath13 .",
    "coverletter   fig4.eps iopart10.clo paper.tex replyletter     to that end we show in figure 2 the predicted optical conductivity for @xmath100 , @xmath101 , with the @xmath102-dependence of the theoretical @xmath81 converted to @xmath5 in @xmath103 using @xmath104 deduced from the above analysis of the d.c .",
    "resistivity ; and with @xmath81 shown for a range of temperatures from @xmath105 to @xmath106 . as @xmath107 , the @xmath4-dependence of the dynamical conductivity follows the d.c .",
    "values shown in the inset to figure 1 . at the lowest temperature @xmath108",
    "an emergent low - frequency drude absorption on frequency scales @xmath109 is evident in @xmath81 ( see also figure 9 of i ) , separated by a clear optical pseudogap centred on @xmath110 from a strong direct gap absorption centred on @xmath111 .",
    "the drude absorption is rapidly suppressed on increasing @xmath4 , being all but dead by @xmath112 ; while the optical pseudogap is progressively ` filled in ' on temperature scales set by @xmath44 .",
    "the direct gap absorption is largely unaffected by temperature until @xmath113 or so ; but is significantly eroded by @xmath114 and in essence destroyed by room temperature .",
    "the optical conductivity of @xmath8 has in fact been measured by kimura  @xcite , but only in the frequency interval @xmath115 to @xmath116 , and at a temperature of @xmath117 .",
    "no strong direct gap absorption was observed , itself suggesting that the absorption occurs at frequencies on the order of @xmath118 or less ; instead a broad , featureless and monotonically decreasing spectral lineshape was found .",
    "this is of course consistent with the prediction from figure 2 above that the direct gap peak is almost completely washed away at room temperature . in order to observe non - trivial @xmath5- and @xmath4-dependence in the optical conductivity of @xmath8 , we thus suggest the frequency domain be extended down to @xmath119 ( or lower to observe the drude absorption ) , and that experiments be performed at considerably lower temperatures such as those shown in figure 2 .",
    "our main focus in i and @xcite has been the strongly correlated heavy fermion regime where the @xmath12-level @xmath120 lies well below the fermi level , with @xmath121 well above it , such that the @xmath12-electrons are essentially localized , @xmath122 .",
    "the underlying local moment approach is not however restricted to the kondo lattice regime , and in particular can also readily handle intermediate valence ( iv ) behaviour . in this case ,",
    "depletion for example of @xmath123 from unity reflects the fact that @xmath16 lies relatively close to the fermi level , such that the appropriate @xmath21 regime is @xmath124 .",
    "the compound @xmath1 , which crystallizes in a simple cubic @xmath125-type structure and does not order magnetically  @xcite , provides a prime example of iv behaviour .",
    "figure 3 shows the experimental d.c .",
    "resistivity of @xmath1 , and its non - magnetic homologue @xmath126 , at ambient pressure ( data from @xcite with the tiny residual resistivity subtracted ) .",
    "the resultant magnetic resistivity @xmath25 is also shown in figure 3 , obtained simply by subtracting the resistivity of @xmath126 from that of @xmath1 ( the samples  @xcite are high quality single crystals , hence the factor @xmath66 in equation ( 2.1 ) is taken as unity ) .",
    "@xmath25 is seen to increase monotonically with @xmath4 , lacking the coherence peak seen in strongly correlated hf materials .",
    "this behaviour is characteristic of iv  @xcite , as too is e.g.   the low / moderate effective mass in the range @xmath127 inferred from dhva  @xcite , optical  @xcite and specific heat  @xcite measurements ; and the @xmath29 mean valence @xmath128 is estimated experimentally as @xmath129@xcite .    in the strongly correlated hf regime ,",
    "physical properties such as @xmath39 exhibit scaling as a function of @xmath130 , independent of the interaction @xmath13 and hybridization @xmath14 as detailed in i ; occurring formally for all @xmath130 in the asymptotic strong coupling limit , and in material practice over a significant albeit naturally finite @xmath45 range as seen above for @xmath8 ( and in  @xcite for kondo insulators ) .",
    "this is _ not _ by contrast the case in the iv regime , and neither is it to be expected . here",
    "the ` full set ' of bare / material parameters @xmath131 and @xmath14 must be specified . to compare theory to experiment for @xmath9 we consider a moderate @xmath132 with @xmath133 and @xmath134 ; corresponding to a modest interaction strength @xmath135 ( with @xmath136 as in i ) and an @xmath137 close to the fermi level ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "the resultant @xmath12-band filling is found to be @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) , consistent with the mixed valence nature of @xmath9 ; and a quasiparticle weight @xmath141 is found , implying an effective mass @xmath142 that is likewise consistent with experiment as above .",

    "the agreement is clearly excellent , for all temperatures .",
    "the inset to figure 3 shows the low temperature behaviour on an expanded scale , together with a fit ( dotted line ) to the @xmath60 fermi liquid form @xmath144 .",
    "as known from experiment  @xcite , and seen also in the present theory , this asymptotic form is seen to persist up to a temperature ` @xmath145'@xmath146 that is an order of magnitude lower than @xmath147 ; and about which fact we make two brief comments .",
    "first , to emphasise that this arises naturally here within a theoretical approach to the periodic anderson model itself ( with no appeal e.g.  to calculations based upon a single - impurity anderson model  @xcite ) .",
    "second , the quantitative distinction between ` @xmath145 ' and @xmath44 is in our view to be anticipated ; for @xmath44 is the natural low - energy scale in the problem , and since @xmath148 is the _ asymptotic _",
    "@xmath149 behaviour , we would as such expect it to arise only for @xmath150 .",
    "while the experimental data shown in figure 3 extend up to @xmath151 , the theoretical @xmath39 may be used to predict the full @xmath26 for @xmath9 over a much larger temperature interval .",
    "to that end we simply calculate @xmath39 at higher @xmath4 , and add to it the resistivity of @xmath152 representing the phonon contribution , itself extended to higher @xmath4 by linear extrapolation of the @xmath31 data in figure 3 ( point - dash line , and which extrapolation is clearly warranted ) .",
    "the resultant @xmath26 is shown in figure 4 out to @xmath153 ; and we note that it continues to increase monotonically above @xmath154 , precluding as such the occurrence of a coherence maximum at a @xmath4 in excess of that shown in figure 3 . experimental results for @xmath26 up to @xmath155 have in fact been reported  @xcite . this data does not appear to be quite as clean as that of  @xcite in the interval @xmath156 , but for @xmath157 the @xmath26 from  @xcite collapses very well onto that of  @xcite ( considered above ) with an overall @xmath41-axis rescaling factor @xmath158 ( equation ( 2.1 ) ) . taking this @xmath66 , the resultant @xmath26 from  @xcite",
    "is shown in figure 4 in the temperature interval @xmath159 ; and is seen to agree well with the theoretical result .",
    "we turn now to the optical conductivity of @xmath9 , which has only recently been measured at infrared frequencies and below  @xcite .",
    "this is reproduced in the top panel of figure 5 , from which three key features are evident  @xcite : the low - frequency drude response characteristic of the free carriers ; a depleted pseudogap occurring at low temperatures ( at @xmath160 ) and flanked on its right by a shoulder at @xmath161 ; followed by the broad , strong direct gap ( or mid - infrared , mir ) peak centred near @xmath162 .",
    "coverletter   fig4.eps iopart10.clo paper.tex replyletter     the bottom panel in figure 5 shows the theoretical optical conductivity at the same temperatures and on the same frequency scale as experiment , obtained using the same bare parameters employed in figures 3,4 , and with @xmath163 as deduced above ; in otherwords with no additional input other than that inferred from the d.c .  transport comparison . barring a mismatch in the relative intensity of the direct gap peak on which we comment below ,",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is seen to be rather good in terms of the pseudogap structure , the shoulder , the position and width of the mir peak , and the thermal evolution of the optical conductivity .",
    "the shoulder in particular merits comment , being a distinct spectral feature that is thermally destroyed with increasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "it has been speculated in  @xcite ( not unreasonably ) that its origin may lie outside the scope of the pam and/or be material specific .",
    "the present results however suggest to the contrary . theoretically , we find that the existence of the shoulder shown in figure 5 is not specific to the particular set of bare material parameters considered , but rather characteristic of iv in general terms  a clear optical shoulder arising in the vicinity of @xmath164 as the bare parameters are varied over quite a significant range .",
    "its origins reflect the underlying behaviour of the @xmath12-electron self - energy , and we do not therefore have a simple physical explanation for it ; but neither do we doubt its generic occurrence . for the case of @xmath9 , with @xmath165 deduced from d.c .",
    "transport as above , the shoulder thus lies at @xmath166 as indicated by the vertical arrows in figure 5 and agreeing rather well with experiment .",
    "finally , we comment on the mismatch in the vertical ( intensity ) axes in figure 5 .",
    "the theoretical @xmath81 represents of course the conductivity in the absence of phonons , which inevitably introduces a certain mismatch between theory and experiment as @xmath107 at temperatures high enough for the phonons to kick in ; but the phonon background would not extend up to mir frequencies , so the intensity of the direct gap peak in theory and experiment should agree . the fact that it does not could obviously mean that a different bare parameter set may be more appropriate than that identified here .",
    "alternatively , the issue may be experimental .",
    "the @xmath81 spectra are obtained  @xcite via kramers - krnig transformation of the total reflectance between @xmath167 and @xmath168 , with a hagen - rubens formula used for low - energy extrapolation ; and with secoverletter   fig4.eps iopart10.clo paper.tex replyletter   veral spectrometer sources employed in different frequency intervals , which require matching using appropriate constant factors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is intricate , and there is undoubtedly the possibility of error in determining the absolute intensity of the direct gap .",
    "a surface impedance probe such as the one used in @xcite might be able to resolve the matter ; while if the issue is not experimental then a more extensive scan of the bare parameter space is required . that notwithstanding , however , the present theory does appear to provide a remarkably consistent description of both transport and optics in @xmath9 .",
    "the classic system @xmath10 has long been subject to extensive investigation , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to its @xmath29 cousin considered above , @xmath10 is a prototypical heavy fermion material ; as attested for example by the large specific heat coefficient @xmath169  @xcite and corresponding effective mass @xmath170  @xcite .    a helpful starting point for comparison of theory",
    "to experiment is a rough knowledge of the parameter regime to which the system belongs . in the case of",
    "@xmath2 we can glean such information from the unusual behaviour of the experimental optical conductivity  @xcite , which is shown in the top panel of figure 7 below .",
    "typical features found in optical lineshapes of hf systems are the drude peak at low frequencies , followed by a pseudogap , with a strong direct gap ( or mir ) absorption at higher frequencies ( see e.g.  figures 2,5,10 ) . in the case of @xmath2",
    "however , while the drude peak is clearly evident at low @xmath4 , a distinct pseudogap and the mir peak are absent .",
    "in fact there is little frequency dependence beyond the drude absorption range .    from our theoretical work in i we know that increasing @xmath18 , and hence reducing the conduction band filling @xmath19 , acts to diminish the pseudogap",
    "( see inset to figure 10 of i ) ; relatedly , it also tends to suppress the direct gap absorption , suggesting that a suitably large @xmath18 is required for @xmath2 .",
    "however this by itself is not sufficient : a large @xmath18 , but with a modest hybridization @xmath14 between the @xmath12-levels and the conduction band , can still give rise to a distinct mir absorption .",
    "a suitably large hybridization thus also seems necessary to suppress strongly the direct gap absorption .",
    "unusually large cef parameters found in inelastic neutron scattering experiments have in fact also been attributed to a large hybridization @xmath14  @xcite , supporting this inference . and",
    "from the large effective mass mentioned above , we know the system is in the strong correlated kondo lattice regime , requiring a significant interaction strength @xmath13 .",
    "the picture of @xmath2 thus suggested is of a system with low conduction band filling @xmath19 ( large @xmath18 ) , a significant hybridization @xmath14 , and strong local interactions .",
    "we have investigated this regime in some detail , and for comparison to transport and optical experiments on @xmath2 will consider explicitly the following material parameters : @xmath171 and @xmath74 ( results are quite insensitive to @xmath20 in the kondo lattice regime ) , together with @xmath172 and @xmath173 ( or @xmath174 signifying strong correlations , where @xmath175 as in i ) . additional specification of @xmath13 and @xmath93 is of course required in order to consider the optical conductivity on all frequency scales , whereas @xmath18 and @xmath20 alone suffice to determine the d.c .",
    "resistivity in the scaling regime . with these parameters",
    "we find a quasiparticle weight @xmath176 and hence an effective mass @xmath177 , in good agreement with @xmath178 deduced from specific heat measurements  @xcite .",
    "the resultant conduction band filling is @xmath179 ; while the @xmath12-level occupancy @xmath180 , consistent with the firmly trivalent ( @xmath181 ) nature of the @xmath28 ion expected in the hf regime .",
    "coverletter   fig4.eps iopart10.clo paper.tex replyletter     we first consider d.c .",
    "transport measurements .",
    "these have been obtained by several groups  @xcite , which we find in general concur well on subtraction of appropriate residual resistivities ( so @xmath38 is taken in equation ( 2.1 ) ) .",
    "we choose to compare explicitly to the @xmath26 data of  @xcite , which is shown in figure 6 ( squares ) at ambient pressure with the residual resistivity subtracted out ; together with the corresponding @xmath25 ( circles ) obtained by further subtracting the resistivity of @xmath182 .",
    "figure 6 also shows corresponding results for @xmath25 obtained at a pressure @xmath183  @xcite ( triangles ) , using the same sample as in  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical @xmath39 is calculated and scaled onto the ambient pressure @xmath25 in the usual way , leading thereby to a coherence scale of @xmath184 . from figure 6 ,",
    "comparison between theory and experiment is seen to be good up to @xmath185 , beyond which the experimental @xmath25 drops much more rapidly with further increasing @xmath4 .",
    "this is natural , for inelastic neutron scattering experiments  @xcite show two higher crystal field levels occuring at almost the same energy , @xmath186 and @xmath187 above the ground state .",
    "marked in figure 6 , these are accessed thermally as @xmath4 approaches @xmath188 , and provided they couple effectively to the conduction band ( as appears to be the case here ) the two additional conduction channels diminish the resistivity significantly .",
    "we now comment briefly on the high pressure magnetic resistivity shown in figure 6 .",
    "the coherence scale @xmath42 itself naturally varies with pressure , but in the strongly correlated kondo lattice regime the @xmath4-dependence of the magnetic resistivity should depend universally on @xmath45 alone (  2 ) .",
    "the same theoretical @xmath39 employed for comparison to the ambient pressure data should thus , with mere rescaling of the axes , account for @xmath25 at @xmath189 ( again up to the temperature at which the cef excitations kick in ) . that indeed it does is shown in figure 6 ( dashed line )",
    "; the resultant coherence scale being found to be @xmath190 .",
    "finally we turn to the optical conductivity , the experimental results  @xcite shown in figure 7 ( top panel ) being obtained from reflectance spectroscopy ( lines ) and surface impedance measurements ( points ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the theoretical @xmath81 obtained with the bare parameters specified above , converted to @xmath103 using @xmath191 inferred above from static transport .",
    "the theory evidently captures the unusual optical characteristics of @xmath2 , and agreement with experiment is seen to be rather good .",
    "a strong drude peak , and a very shallow pseudogap , are seen at the lowest temperatures in theory and experiment ; the drude absorption collapsing on a temperature scale of @xmath192 , above which very little @xmath4 dependence is found across the entire frequency range",
    ". most significantly , no distinct direct gap / mir peak arises , the spectrum being largely featureless ( the small feature visible at @xmath193 in the theoretical @xmath81 occurs on the effective bandwidth scale , and its intensity diminishes further with increasing @xmath13 ) .",
    "the nominal location of the direct gap itself can however be determined theoretically frcoverletter   fig4.eps iopart10.clo paper.tex replyletter   om the renormalized band structure underlying the present theory ( as considered in i , see figure 11 ) .",
    "it is found to lie at @xmath194 as marked in figure 7 , albeit that no sharp absorption occurs in its vicinity .",
    "this recently discovered  @xcite , moderately heavy fermion compound crystallizes in a tetragonal structure consisting of alternate layers of @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "it superconducts below @xmath197 ( the highest transition temperature of all known hf systems at ambient pressure  @xcite ) , and is paramagnetic for @xmath198 .",
    "the experimental resistivities @xmath26 determined by four different groups  @xcite are shown in figure 8 . that they differ widely presumably reflects intrinsic difficulties in measuring the dimensions of relatively small samples .",
    "their basic equivalence is however seen by taking the results of one as a reference and rescaling the @xmath199-axis for each of the remaining data sets . with this , as shown in the inset to figure 8 , all four resistivities collapse to essentially common form ( that of  @xcite deviating just slightly at higher @xmath4 ) .",
    "these differences are nonetheless potentially significant when comparing to theory , for which the magnetic contribution @xmath25 is required , obtained as in equation ( 2.1 ) by subtracting the resistivity of the non - magnetic @xmath200 .",
    "the results in figure 8 show that the @xmath66 factor in equation ( 2.1 )  the relative weight of @xmath26 compared to that for the non - magnetic homologue  could vary by a factor of up to four or so , and is not therefore known with confidence .",
    "figure 9 shows the experimental @xmath25 ( open circles ) determined in  @xcite by subtracting the resistivity of @xmath200 from that for @xmath11 ; corresponding as such to @xmath38 ( or equivalently , if e.g.   @xmath26 from  @xcite had been used instead , to an @xmath66 of @xmath201 ) .    to compare to theory we consider the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with @xmath202 and @xmath203 ( corresponding to an intermediate coupling strength @xmath204 ) .",
    "the resultant theoretical @xmath39 is compared to experiment in figure 9 ( solid line ) , yielding a coherence scale of @xmath205 .",
    "it matches @xmath25 for @xmath206 , the deviation at low temperatures presumably reflecting the approach to the superconducting state .",
    "the deviation above @xmath207 also appears natural , since a direct determination of the cef energy level scheme from inelastic neutron scattering  @xcite shows an excited level at @xmath208 or @xmath209 ( with a second at a much higher energy , @xmath210 ) , the extra conduction channel acting to diminish @xmath25 more rapidly than the @xmath211-channel theory .",
    "our guess is that the latter inference is correct , at least qualitatively .",
    "a degree of caution is however required , since this is sensitive to a change in the value of @xmath66 . to illustrate that , figure 9 also shows a new @xmath25 ( filled circles ) obtained with @xmath212 in equation ( 2.1 ) .",
    "the theoretical @xmath39 with the same coherence scale @xmath213 , but with the overall @xmath199-axis naturally increased by factor of @xmath214 , now describes @xmath25 very well for essentially all @xmath215 .",
    "the quantitative influence of the extra conduction channel can thus be assessed with confidence only if the relative values of the resistivity for the magnetic and non - magnetic compounds are known accurately ; although we add that the inferred low temperature coherence scale @xmath216 is not itself sensitive to @xmath66 .",
    "we turn now to the optical conductivity .",
    "experimental results from reflectivity measurements  @xcite are shown in figure 10 ( top panel ) , with the @xmath5-dependence on a log scale up to @xmath217 and a linear scale thereafter ( separated by a vertical line ) .",
    "for @xmath218 the results are extrapolated ( dashed lines ) towards the d.c .",
    "limit  @xcite , as required for the kramers - krnig analysis of the reflectivity that leads to the experimental @xmath81 shown .",
    "the theoretical @xmath81 is shown in the lower panel , for the bare parameters specified above , with @xmath219 .",
    "the comparison between theory and experiment is at least qualitatively satisfactory , albeit not as good as for @xmath9 or @xmath10 ( perhaps unsurprisingly given the quasi-2d nature of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the pseudogap at @xmath220 is seen to lie at @xmath221 , and as in experiment shifts gradually to higher @xmath5 with increasing temperature and fills up progressively  on the scale of @xmath222 or @xmath223 .",
    "the direct gap absorption in theory and experiment lies at @xmath224 ; and starts to lose spectral weight significantly for @xmath68 or so , i.e.  on the scale of @xmath225 itself .",
    "this suggests that @xmath11 is not in the strong coupling , kondo lattice regime ; since in strong coupling the direct gap / mir absorption is significantly eroded for temperatures approaching the order of the direct gap itself ( @xmath226 or @xmath227 in the present case ) , see e.g.  figure 12 of i. for @xmath11 by contrast , significant thermal erosion is seen to occur for @xmath228 , which behaviour is typical of intermediate coupling strengths .",
    "that also appears consistent with dhva measurements  @xcite , which yield a moderate effective mass @xmath229 in the range @xmath230 .",
    "two further points should be mentioned .",
    "first , the @xmath231 values of the theoretical @xmath81 are clearly lower than the experimental extrapolations . as @xmath107 ,",
    "the latter extrapolate to the d.c .",
    "conductivity obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the d.c .",
    "limit of the theoretical @xmath232 by contrast gives the @xmath233 shown in figure 9 ( solid line ) , and aside from the @xmath234 case this agrees well with the experimental d.c .",
    "conductivity of  @xcite  which as seen from figure 8 differs by a factor of two or so from that of  @xcite .",
    "the issue here appears largely to be experimental , reflecting the significant difference between the resistivities of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "second , the vertical arrows at @xmath235 in the experimental @xmath81 of figure 10 indicate weak additional absorption that has been ascribed  @xcite to a holstein band due to coupling to a bosonic mode . this is not",
    "of course included in the present theory , which thus shows somewhat less absorption in the region .",
    "we have here employed a local moment approach to the periodic anderson lattice developed in i , to make direct comparison to d.c .",
    "transport and optical conductivities of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath29 compound is a representative intermediate valence material , and the others typify heavy fermion behaviour , from the strongly correlated kondo lattice regime appropriate to @xmath10 and @xmath8 to what we believe is the somewhat weaker coupling case of @xmath11 . in broad terms",
    "more or less all characteristic features of the optics and transport of these materials are captured ; the natural exception , omitted from the model itself , being crystal field effects which may ( or may not ) show up in the experimental resistivity as a reduction below 1-channel behaviour at suitably high temperatures .",
    "the theory in general performs rather well quantitatively , and also captures notable features specific to individual systems  for example the existence of a low - frequency shoulder observed in the optics of @xmath9  @xcite , or the absence of any significant direct gap / mir absorption in @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "minimalist though it is the underlying model , and theory for it , thus appear to provide quite a comprehensive and successful description of experiment .",
    "this we attribute in no small part both to the dominance of the local electron scattering inherent to the model itself , and the need to provide an adequate theoretical description of such on all experimentally relevant frequency and temperature scales .",
