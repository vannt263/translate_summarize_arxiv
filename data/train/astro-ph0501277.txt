    "grs 1915 + 105 is well known for its diversity of light curves ( e.g. morgan , remillard & greiner , 1997 ; belloni et al .",
    "rxte has pointed at it numerous times and yet the light curve has remained largely unpredictable .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , in a model independent way , classified most of the light curves into twelve classes which are designated as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "naik et al .",
    "( 2002a ) showed that there is another independent class called @xmath2 .",
    "alhough the light curve was observed to change from one class to another , the actual transition was never reported and therefore , the actual physical process which triggers a specific class transition has never been investigated .",
    "it was predicted in several earlier papers using the advective flow paradigm ( chakrabarti & nandi , 2000 ; nandi , manickam & chakrabarti , 2000 ; chakrabarti et al .",
    "2002 ) that variation of the keplerian and the sub - keplerian accretion rates might cause class transitions . it was pointed out that there are actually five fundamental states differing only by keplerian and sub - keplerian accretion rates .",
    "ways in which the transition occurs between these states decide which class would be seen .",
    "it was also pointed out that the outflows play a major role in class transitions , since they interact with the soft photons and affect the spectral slopes as well .",
    "recently , chakrabarti et al . (",
    "2004 ) presented two examples of class transitions from ixae observations and concluded that a class transition always take place through some unknown class . in many of the classes that grs 1915 + 105 exhibits",
    ", one could see the presence of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) . very recently , using extensive time - dependent numerical simulation of accretion flows that include cooling effects , it has been shown ( chakrabarti , acharyya & molteni , 2004 ) that the so - called advective disk paradigm is capable of explaining qpos very naturally .",
    "the prime cause of the quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of x - rays from compact objects is found to be quasi - coherent shock oscillations .",
    "the post - shock region ( i.e. , the so - called centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer , or cenbol ) outside a black hole horizon acts as the compton cloud by intercepting soft photons from a keplerian disk and reprocessing them to high energies . along with the shock oscillations , the size of the cenbol changes and therefore the number of intercepted soft photons oscillates , causing the observed qpo .",
    "power density spectra of these ` simulated ' light curves directly show how qpos occur at or near break frequency  a well - known observed phenomenon .",
    "the frequency of oscillation is thought to be related to the inverse of the infall time - scale ( molteni , sponholz and chakrabarti , 1996 ) and as such should increase with the increase of the sub - keplerian accretion rate undergoing the shock transition as the cooling rate is increased .",
    "this general behaviour has also been observed ( remillard et al . 1999 ) .    in this paper , we present a large number of examples of the ` rare ' class transitions , all of them being from the indian satellite data , and analyze what happens during such a transition .",
    "in particular , we follow the light - curve , the power density spectra and the photon spectra throughout the transition .",
    "we found that : ( a ) a class transition is invariably accompanied by a significant variation of the average x - ray photon count rate , indicating that either the keplerian disk rate , or the sub - keplerian flow rate or both may be changing , ( b ) in between two known classes , a class of unknown type appears for hundreds of minutes and ( c ) during a transition , the photon index becomes noisy until the flows settles into a new class indicating the presence of turbulent behaviour during transition . at the same time",
    ", we also study the behaviour of qpos and show how the frequency is changed consistently with the accretion rates as inferred from the spectra . in the next section , we present the observational results on class transition . based on the new inputs from the observational results , in section 3",
    ", we discuss what the nature of the accretion flows might be .",
    "we find that in order to enable class transition in a few hours , a significant fraction of the flow must be nearly freely falling , i.e. , sub - keplerian . finally , in section 4 , we draw our conclusions .",
    "the results we discuss in this section were obtained by the pointed proportional counters ( ppcs ) in the ixae instrument aboard the indian satellite irs - p3 ( agrawal 1998 ) which functioned during 1996 - 2000 .",
    "the operating energy range is between 2 and 18 kev .",
    "the counts are saved in the archive only in two channels ",
    "one is 2 - 6kev and the other is 6 - 18kev .",
    "the time resolution in medium mode could be @xmath3s but normally the time resolution was set to be @xmath4s . as a result of the presence of only two energy channels , only two points could be obtained in the spectrum and a so - called ` mean photon index ' ( mpi ) @xmath5 can be calculated after each second .",
    "similarly , @xmath3s time resolution in the medium mode restricts the observation of qpos up to @xmath6hz only , while the @xmath4s resolution restricts the reporting of qpos up to @xmath7hz only .",
    "nevertheless , the light curves are clear enough and the identification of the specific class can be done without ambiguity ( e.g. , naik et al 2001 , 2002ab ; paul et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it is to be noted that ( a ) the counts in the high energy bin could be very low and the @xmath5 suffers from low number statistics and ( b ) the slope itself is known to vary in the @xmath8kev range , especially , the spectrum becomes harder above @xmath9kev in the hard state .",
    "an assumption of a constant slope @xmath5 will thus be erroneous .",
    "therefore , while @xmath5 gives an indication of how the slope changes ( as a colour - colour diagram ) its absolute value should be treated with caution .",
    "before we present the ixae observations , it is useful to give a brief description of the qpos which are so far observed in grs 1915 + 105 . broadly speaking , this can be subdivided into four classes : ( i ) low frequency qpo ( lfqpo ) in the range @xmath10 hz , ( ii ) break frequency ( bf ) or intermediate frequency qpo ( ifqpo ) in the range @xmath11 hz , ( iii ) high frequency qpo ( hfqpo ) in the range @xmath12 hz and ( iv ) the very high frequency qpo ( vhfqpo ) around 67 hz .    in table 1",
    ", we present the log of the observations we report in this paper which showed class transitions . the first column refers to the figure where the results are shown .",
    "the second column refers to the name of the satellite .",
    "the third column shows the date of observation and the time when the observation started .",
    "the fourth column gives the orbit numbers ( or , the obs .",
    "i d in case of rxte ) plotted in the figure . typically , the time interval between two successive orbits is around @xmath13 minutes .",
    "the fifth column gives the exact nature of class transition .",
    "since during transition , a given class is not found to be ` canonical ' as defined by belloni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we have put the class - names inside quotation marks .",
    "0.5 cm    .[table1 ] class transitions of grs 1915 + 105 reported in this paper [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath14 observation time at the begining of the first orbit ; @xmath15 observation time at the begining of the second orbit +    in fig .",
    "1(a - c ) , we present the light curves ( @xmath8kev ) of the june 22nd , 1997 observation in the upper panel and the mean photon index ( mpi ) in the lower panels . the mpi @xmath5 is obtained using the definition : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the photon count rate from the top layer of the ppc and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the mean energies in each channel",
    "thus , @xmath21kev and @xmath22kev respectively .",
    "we have thus normalized the count rate per kev and then obtained the slope in the log - log plot since we expect a power - law slope in the @xmath23 kev range .",
    "the panel 1a is in the so - called @xmath24 class ( belloni et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the panel 1b is in a unknown class and the panel 1c clearly shows the transition from the unknown class to the so - called @xmath25 class .",
    "the panels are separated by about three hours .    in the lower panels , the @xmath5 oscillates between @xmath26 to @xmath27 in fig .",
    "1a very systematically . in figs .",
    "1b and 1c , the unknown class produced very noisy photon spectral slope variation .",
    "as soon as the @xmath25 class is achieved after one ` semi-@xmath25 ' oscillation , noise in @xmath5 is reduced dramatically .",
    "the ixae observation of the 23rd , 24th and 25th of june , 1997 showed that the system was still in @xmath25 class after the transition on 22nd of june , 1997 .",
    "subsequently , on 25th june , 1997 there was another transition to @xmath28 and it returned back to @xmath25 .",
    "it remained in @xmath25 class on the 26th of june before returning to @xmath29 on the 27th .",
    "thus @xmath30 transitions took place in a matter of five days . the exact time and duration of the last transition mentioned above",
    "could not be seen because of the lack of observation .    in fig .",
    "2(a - c ) the observation of ixae on 25th of june , 1997 is presented .",
    "the panels are separated by about one and a half hours . here too , the upper and lower panels represent variation of photon count rates and @xmath5 respectively . in fig .",
    "2a , the grs 1915 + 105 is in the so - called @xmath28-like class , though the photon count rate showed considerable variations , not characteristic of @xmath28 .",
    "correspondingly , the average spectra also softened as is suggested by the gradual decrease in @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "2b , this trend continued until a ` semi-@xmath25 ' class was achieved and the noise in the photon spectra went down . in fig . 2c , after one full orbit , the count rate went up further by about a factor of four and a steady @xmath25 state was achieved .",
    "the average ( photon ) spectral index @xmath5 was @xmath31 in fig .",
    "2a , but it became @xmath32 in fig .",
    "1c , indicating general softening .    in fig .",
    "3(a - b ) we show the light curve and @xmath5 from ixae data obtained on the 8th of june , 1999 .",
    "the two panels are from two successive orbits @xmath33 minutes apart . in fig .",
    "3a , the count rate was very high compared to what is expected from a typical @xmath28 state although the power density spectrum ( pds ) is typical of that of the @xmath28 class .",
    "a qpo at @xmath34hz is present .",
    "the @xmath5 is @xmath35 which is harder than what is observed in fig .",
    "2 . when combined with rxte data of that date ( fig .",
    "3a ) , one finds that for a long time ( @xmath36s ) there was no signature of any ` dip ' which is the characteristic of the @xmath37 class .",
    "hence , this must be in an unknown class , more close to @xmath28 than any other .",
    "rxte also observed this object on the 7th of june , 1999 and found the object to be in the @xmath28 class . in fig .",
    "3b , the light curve in the next orbit of ixae shows evidence of the so - called @xmath37 class .",
    "interestingly , the spectra gradually ` hardened ' to @xmath38 just before the ` dip ' .",
    "the spectra characteristically softened in the ` dip ' region with @xmath39 as the inner edge of the disk disappeared .",
    "this class transition is confirmed in the data of rxte also shown in fig .",
    "the lower panels showed that the spectral slopes obtained for rxte data calculated in a similar way to @xmath5 was calculated ( eqn .",
    "1 ) . here , the photons were first binned in @xmath40 kev and @xmath41kev ( in epoch 4 of rxte , the science data is available in a maximum of 35 channels .",
    "thus the energy channel width could not be made identical to @xmath42kev as in ixae ) before computing @xmath5 from @xmath43 where @xmath21kev , @xmath44kev and @xmath45kev .",
    "note that there is a large difference between the mean spectral slopes calculated from ixae and rxte data .",
    "the main reasons appear to be ( a ) by decreasing @xmath20 from @xmath46kev in ixae to @xmath47kev the value of @xmath5 is increased by @xmath48 per cent .",
    "( b ) usually the spectrum in the low state ( as in between the ` dips ' in the @xmath37 class ) has a harder tail for energy above @xmath49kev .",
    "thus decresing the binsize limit from @xmath46kev to @xmath47kev decreases the photon counts in harder parts of the spectrum .",
    "these two combined effects cause the mean spectrum of rxte to be softer .",
    "its lower noise is clearly due to its very high count rates ( about @xmath50 times higher than ixae ) for its higher effective surface area ( @xmath51 as opposed to @xmath52 for one of the detectors of ixae ) and its usage of xenon as opposed to a mixture of @xmath53 per cent argon and @xmath54 per cent methane .    to show that the class in fig .",
    "3b is indeed that of the @xmath37 class , we plot in fig .",
    "4 the power density spectra .",
    "this showed a characteristic break at bf @xmath55hz and the hfqpo at @xmath56hz with a broad ` q ' weak qpo at the break frequency .",
    "the pds of the light curve ( fig .",
    "3a ) in the previous orbit is @xmath28-like and it does not show any lfqpo , bf / ifqpo or vhfqpo .    in fig .",
    "5(a - b ) , we show another example of a class transition in which the light curve in the ` @xmath25 ' class ( fig .",
    "5a ) goes over to the so - called @xmath57 class ( fig .",
    "this is from the ixae observation on the 25th of june , 2000 .",
    "the count rate in this ` @xmath25 ' class was much higher than that seen in figs .",
    "1 and 2 and the photon spectral index in the lower panel also showed that the spectra are harder ( average @xmath58 as compared to @xmath59 in fig . 1 and @xmath32 in fig",
    "so , it could be an intermediate class . in",
    "the alpha class @xmath5 became noisy and the transition is clearly obvious .",
    "this ` @xmath57 ' lasted for a short time , since observations from 18th june , 2000 to 25th june , 2000 as reported in naik et al ( 2002b ) always showed a @xmath25 class with gradually increasing burst recurring time - scale . on the 25th , this trend reversed after this ` @xmath57 ' class and from the 26th the recurrenced time again went up .",
    "so the system might have experience perturbations for only a short time .    the change of class is also reflected in fig .",
    "6 where the time dependence of the power density spectra ( pds ) is plotted . along the y - axis ,",
    "the frequency ( @xmath60 ) of the pds is presented . the power ( p )",
    "itself is marked on the contours plotted : solid curve , dotted curve and dashed curves are for @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "note that the highest power remains at around @xmath64 in the @xmath25 state .",
    "a weaker peak occurs at around @xmath65 .",
    "however , after the transition , the dominant frequency seems to be at around @xmath66 which corresponds to @xmath67hz .",
    "the first and the most important point to note is the variation in the count rate in the pre - transition period and the duration of a transition .",
    "the variation in the count rate points to the variation in the accretion rate while the duration gives an indication of the infall time .",
    "details of the possible nature of the flow geometry during transition will be discussed elsewhere ( nandi et al . in preparation ) . given that there is a gap of more or less @xmath13 minutes in between two successive observations of ixae , the duration @xmath68 could be at the most @xmath69 hours i.e , @xmath70s .",
    "this is short even for a free falling gas from the outer edge of the disk located at @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the schwarzschild radius of the central black hole of mass @xmath73 ( greiner , cuby and mccaughrean , 2001 ) since this is around @xmath74 the viscous time for a keplerian disk of similar size must be at least ten to a hundred times larger , i.e , few @xmath75s for any reasonable viscosity .",
    "this indicates that if the transition takes place in @xmath76s , the accretion flow must be nearly freely falling , i.e. , sub - keplerian , and must originate from intermediate distances , rather than from the outer edge , i.e. , out of a keplerian disk through energy deposition or otherwise .",
    "this flow is neither a static corona , nor a flow which is radiatively less efficient .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and smith , heindl and swank ( 2002 ) indeed found observational signatures of the nearly free - falling matter in several black hole candidates which causes dynamical spectral state changes .",
    "we thus believe that the variation of the rate of the sub - keplerian matter may be responsible for the class transitions we presented here .",
    "in this paper , we presented several examples of variability class transitions in grs 1915 + 105 as observed by the indian x - ray astronomy experiment ( ixae ) aboard the indian satellite irs - p3 .",
    "we also presented one example from rxte .",
    "we showed that while the signature of a class transition in the light curve may be abrupt , the process itself is gradual over a period of about @xmath77 hours during which the light curve passes through unknown classes . during the transition ,",
    "the photon count rates change significantly which indicates changes in the accretion rates . in a model - independent way , we argue that probably only the rate of the sub - keplerian flow changes since the duration of transition is @xmath78s , much shorter than the viscous time by factor of ten to hundred . during the transitions ,",
    "the photon count rates were found to be abnormal and were rapidly changing .",
    "for instance in fig .",
    "3a , the x - ray count rate was seen to vary by more than @xmath79% in a matter of a few minutes in the unknown class .",
    "these are indications that nearly freely falling ( i.e. , a low angular momentum ) sub - keplerian flow may present in the accretion flow of grs 1915 + 105 , supporting earlier conclusions of smith et al .",
