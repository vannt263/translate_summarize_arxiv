    "the pions ( @xmath8 ) are the goldstone bosons of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . their strong interaction dynamics at low energies can therefore be calculated systematically ( and accurately ) with chiral perturbation theory in form of a loop expansion based on an effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "the very accurate two - loop predictions @xcite for the s - wave @xmath9-scattering lengths , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , have been confirmed experimentally by analyzing the @xmath9 final - state interaction effects occurring in various ( rare ) charged kaon decay modes @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic processes with pions offer further possibilities to test chiral perturbation theory .",
    "for example , pion compton scattering @xmath12 allows one to extract the electric and magnetic polarizabilities ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) of the charged pion .",
    "chiral perturbation theory at two - loop order gives for the dominant pion polarizability difference the firm prediction @xmath15@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it is however in conflict with the existing experimental results from serpukhov @xmath17@xmath16 @xcite and mami @xmath18@xmath16 @xcite which amount to values more than twice as large .",
    "certainly , these existing experimental determinations of @xmath19 raise doubts about their correctness since they violate the chiral low - energy theorem notably by a factor 2 .",
    "it is worth to note that a recent dispersive analysis @xcite of the belle data for @xmath20 gives the fit value @xmath21@xmath16 , compatible with chiral perturbation theory .    in that contradictory situation",
    "it is promising that the ongoing compass experiment @xcite at cern aims at remeasuring the pion polarizabilities , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with high statistics using the primakoff effect .",
    "the scattering of high - energy negative pions in the coulomb - field of a heavy nucleus ( of charge @xmath22 ) gives access to cross sections for @xmath23 reactions through the equivalent photon method @xcite .",
    "the consistent theoretical framework to extract the pion polarizabilities from the measured cross sections for ( low - energy ) pion compton scattering @xmath12 or the primary pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung process @xmath24 has been described ( in one - loop approximation ) in refs.@xcite .",
    "it has been stressed that at the same order as the polarizability difference @xmath19 there exists a further ( partly compensating ) pion - structure effect in form of a unique pion - loop correction ( interpretable as photon scattering off the  pion - cloud around the pion  ) .",
    "in addition to these strong interaction effects , the qed radiative corrections to real and virtual pion compton scattering @xmath25 have been calculated in refs.@xcite .",
    "the relative smallness of the pion - structure effects in low - energy pion compton scattering @xcite makes it necessary to include such higher order electromagnetic corrections .",
    "the compass experiment is set up to detect simultaneously various ( multi - particle ) hadronic final - states which are produced in the primakoff scattering of high - energy pions .",
    "the neutral pion production channel @xmath26 serves as a test of the qcd chiral anomaly by measuring the @xmath27 coupling constant @xmath28gev@xmath29 . for the two - body process @xmath30 the one - loop @xcite and",
    "two - loop corrections @xcite of chiral perturbation theory as well as qed radiative corrections @xcite have already been worked out .",
    "the @xmath31 reaction with three charged pions in the final - state is used in the energy range above 1gev to study the spectroscopy of non - strange meson resonances @xcite and to search for so - called exotic meson resonances @xcite .",
    "the very high statistics of the compass experiment allows it to continue the event rates with three pions in the final - state even downward to the threshold .",
    "the ( differential ) cross sections for the @xmath32 reactions in the low - energy region offer new possibilities to test the strong interaction dynamics of the pions as predicted by chiral perturbation theory . in a recent work @xcite the production amplitudes for @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "have been calculated analytically at one - loop order in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "it has been found that the next - to - leading order corrections from chiral loops and counterterms enhance sizeably ( by a factor @xmath35 ) the total cross section for neutral pion - pair production @xmath36 .",
    "by contrast the total cross section for charged pion - pair production @xmath37 remains almost unchanged in comparison to its tree - level result .",
    "this different behavior can be understood from the varying influence of the chiral corrections on the pion - pion final - state interaction ( @xmath38 versus @xmath39 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to further improve the theoretical description of the @xmath40 reactions by considering the corresponding qed radiative corrections .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the simpler case of neutral pion - pair production @xmath41 , for which the number of contributing one - photon loop diagrams is limited to about a dozen .",
    "another fortunate circumstance is that the ( leading - order ) chiral @xmath42 contact - vertex factors out of all photon - loop diagrams and therefore the radiative corrections to @xmath43 can be represented simply by a multiplicative correction factor @xmath44 .",
    "infrared finiteness of these virtual radiative corrections is achieved ( in the standard way ) by including soft photon radiation below an energy cut - off @xmath3 .",
    "taking @xmath45mev , we find that the radiative corrections to the total cross section for @xmath46 vary between @xmath4 and @xmath5 for center - of - mass energies from threshold up to @xmath6 .",
    "an electromagnetic counterterm ( necessary in order to cancel all ultraviolet divergences generated by the photon - loops ) gives an additional constant contribution of about @xmath7 , however with a large uncertainty .",
    "the radiative corrections to the charged pion - pair production process @xmath47 can be roughly estimated to be a factor @xmath48 times larger , arguing that in this case twice as many charged pions are involved in virtual photon - loops and soft photon bremsstrahlung .",
    "in this section we calculate analytically the radiative corrections to the neutral pion - pair photoproduction process : @xmath49 as they arise from one - photon loop diagrams at order @xmath50 . for a concise presentation of our analytical results",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following dimensionless mandelstam variables : @xmath51 with @xmath52mev the charged pion mass . in this ( adapted ) notation @xmath53 is the total center - of - mass energy of the process .",

    "let us recall the dynamical description of the process @xmath67 at low energies @xcite .",
    "when choosing for the ( transversal ) real photon @xmath68 the coulomb - gauge in the center - of - mass frame , the conditions @xmath69 imply that all diagrams for which the photon couples to the in - coming pion @xmath70 vanish identically .",
    "furthermore , in the convenient parametrization of the special - unitary matrix - field @xmath71 no @xmath72 and @xmath73 contact - vertices exist ( at leading order ) . under these assumptions one",
    "is left with one single @xmath58-channel pole diagram in which the chiral @xmath42 contact - vertex is followed by a photon - pion coupling proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "the virtual radiative corrections to @xmath75 are obtained by dressing this tree diagram with a photon - loop in all possible ways ( see figs.1 - 4 ) .",
    "a fortunate circumstance is that the ( leading order ) chiral @xmath42 transition amplitude @xmath76/f_\\pi^2 $ ] depends only on the @xmath77 invariant mass and thus factors out of all photon - loop diagrams .",
    "the coulomb - gauge ( @xmath78 ) leaves the scalar product @xmath74 as the only possible coupling term for the external real photon . as a consequence of",
    "these features the radiative corrections due to photon - loops can represented simply by a multiplicative correction factor .",
    "its real part which is only of relevance is denoted by @xmath79 .",
    "we use dimensional regularization to treat both ultraviolet and infrared divergences ( where the latter are caused by the masslessness of the photon ) .",
    "divergent pieces of one - loop integrals show up in form of the composite constant : @xmath80 containing a simple pole at @xmath81 and @xmath82 is an arbitrary mass scale .",
    "ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences are distinguished by the feature of whether the condition for convergence of the @xmath83-dimensional integral is @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "we discriminate them in the notation by putting appropriate subscripts , i.e. @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in order to simplify all calculations",

    "note that we have used the ( concise ) spectral function representation for the infrared divergent ( scalar ) loop integral involving one photon and two pion propagators .",
    "if an infinitesimal photon mass @xmath115 is introduced as an ( alternative ) infrared regulator the infrared divergence @xmath87 is to be identified with the logarithm @xmath116 .",
    "next , we come to the irreducible @xmath117-channel diagrams of class ( vii ) shown in fig.3 . since the contribution from the left diagram ( involving the two - photon contact - vertex ) gets ( partly ) canceled by a term from the right diagram it is advantageous to specify only their total contribution to the @xmath97-factor . after reducing the loop integrals with four propagators",
