    "neutrino experiments in the last decade have determined a number of neutrino parameters to a good accuracy . among the currently unknown quantities are ( i ) the chooz mixing angle @xmath3 , ( ii ) the sign of atmospheric mass - squared difference and ( iii ) the cp violating phase @xmath0 .",
    "experiments are being designed / constructed to measure these quantities .    at present , there are three efforts to measure a non - zero value for @xmath3 using reactor neutrinos as the source . in each of these experiments",
    ", the survival probability @xmath4 will be measured using a pair of identical detectors , one close to the reactor and the other about a km away .",
    "the deficit in the far detector is a measure of @xmath5 .",
    "since these are all disapperance experiments , they should have very low systematic uncertainties , to measure the small value of @xmath5 .",
    "double - chooz will start taking data soon and it will see a positive signal if @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "daya bay @xcite and reno @xcite are expected to improve on this measurement .",
    "daya bay s final sensitivity extends up to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is possible to determine @xmath5 by measuring @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in an accelerator experiment .",
    "t2k @xcite and no@xmath10a @xcite experiments aim to do this .",
    "even if these experiments see a positive signal , determination of @xmath5 from their data will be subject to very large uncertainties because the probability @xmath9 depends on all three unknowns mentioned above @xcite .",
    "the reactor experiments , on the other hand , will give a clean measurement of @xmath5 because @xmath4 , at the relevant energies , depends only on this unknown neutrino parameter .",
    "we label the three neutrino mass eigenstates by their respective eigenvalues @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . from the three masses",
    ", we can define two independent mass - squared differences @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the mass - squared difference which drives the solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "it is known to be positive and its magnitude is much smaller than that of @xmath17 .",
    "atmospheric neutrino oscillations are essentially driven by @xmath17 whose magnitude is known but not the sign . if the neutrino masses follow the hierarchy @xmath18 , called normal hierarchy ( nh ) , @xmath17 is positive .",
    "it is negative if the neutrino masses have the pattern @xmath19 , called inverted hierarchy ( ih ) .",
    "present data allows both the possibilities .",
    "determining the sign of @xmath17 establishes the pattern ( or hierarchy ) of neutrino masses . in this letter",
    ", we propose a new scheme to realise this goal .",
    "neutrino propagation through dense matter , leads to an effective mass - squared term ( usually called the matter term ) in their hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the interference of this term with the original mass - squared differences leads to the modification of the neutrino masses and mixing angles and hence their oscillation probabilities .",
    "the change induced by the interference , of course , depends on the sign of the original mass - squared difference and hence is different for nh and ih . by measuring this change in the oscillation probability @xmath9 , induced by the matter term",
    ", we can determine the mass hierarchy .",
    "@xmath9 depends on all three unknowns of neutrino physics .",
    "hence it is very difficult to determine which of the three unknowns causes a change in @xmath9 .",
    "measurement of @xmath3 in reactor neutrino experiments leads to disentanglement of one parameter .",
    "the cp violating phase @xmath20 , in principle , can be determined by measuring the difference in oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "however , this method can not be used to disentangle @xmath0 and the matter term because the matter term changes sign under cp and induces a ` cp violation - like ' change in the probabilities .",
    "therefore a new strategy is needed to separate these two interlinked effects .",
    "a radical proposal was made sometime ago to disentangle @xmath0 from the matter term in @xmath9 .",
    "the expression for @xmath9 contains three terms and only one of them is dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "if this term can be made to vanish , by an appropriate choice of neutrino energy and baseline , then it is possible to determine neutrino hierarchy without any information on @xmath0 .",
    "calculation of the baseline , called _ magic baseline _ , gives an answer @xmath21 km @xcite and it is independent of energy @xcite .",
    "having sufficient neutrino fluxes at such a large distance from the source will be very difficult with the current accelerator technology .    in this letter",
    ", we make an alternative proposal of a much shorter * magical * baseline . in the original magic baseline proposal ,",
    "the condition that the @xmath0 dependent term vanish , holds both for nh and ih .",
    "this condition is quite restrictive and leads to such a large baseline .",
    "we propose an alternative condition which demands that the @xmath20 terms should vanish only for ih .",
    "this leads to a relation between the neutrino energy @xmath22 and the baseline @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , we also demand that @xmath9 should be large for nh .",
    "this leads to a different condition on @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "solving these two equations gives us the solutions @xmath24 km and @xmath25 gev . at this energy , for this baseline",
    ", @xmath9 is very small for ih and near the maximum for nh , for any value of @xmath20 .",
    "thus a neutrino beam with its flux maximum at this energy can make a clean measurement of neutrino mass hiearchy , independent of @xmath20 .",
    "a very good approximate expression for @xmath9 , for three flavour oscillations including matter effects , is usually given as an expansion in the small parameter @xmath26 .",
    "it can be written as @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the matter term @xcite @xmath30 ev@xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the density of matter through which the neutrino propagates . here",
    "@xmath17 is given in units of ev@xmath31 , @xmath23 is in km and @xmath22 is in gev .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath33 are given by @xmath34 we note that only @xmath35 among them depends on the phase @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath9 depends on all the three unknowns .",
    "data on @xmath9 from a single experiment leads to a degenerate set of solutions @xcite .",
    "data on @xmath9 from experiments with different baselines can resolve some of these degeneracies @xcite .",
    "here we assume that @xmath3 will be measured in reactor neutrino experiments @xcite , which resolves the degeneracies involving this parameter .",
    "our proposal in this letter makes the hierarchy-@xmath0 degeneracy irrelevant .    in eq .",
    "( [ pmue ] ) the dependence on the matter term @xmath36 is explicitly displayed .",
    "@xmath17 is positive for nh and is negative for ih .",
    "@xmath37 , on the other hand , is positive for neutrinos and is negative for anti - neutrinos .",
    "thus , if we have only a neutrino beam , then @xmath36 is positive for nh and is negative for ih . for anti - neutrino beam ,",
    "the situation is reversed . in eq .",
    "( [ pmue ] ) , the first term is the most sensitive to hierarchy but the second term provides a significant correction . as one varies @xmath20 in its range , the change in the second term can cancel the change in the first term caused by the change in hierarchy .",
    "in other words , there exist two degenerate sets of solutions , ( nh and @xmath38 ) and ( ih and @xmath39 ) , both of which give the same value of @xmath9 in a given experiment @xcite .",
    "this leads to hierarchy-@xmath0 degeneracy and restricts our ability to determine the hierarchy . to overcome this ,",
    "it was proposed to choose a baseline and energy for which @xmath40 , so that the second and third terms vanish .",
    "the above constraint , for the first non - trivial zero , gives the magic baseline condition @xmath41 km , independent of the energy @xcite .",
    "the energy can be chosen by the condition that the oscillation probability be a maximum at this baseline .",
    "therefore , one can indeed determine mass hierarchy at the magic baseline in a clean manner , independent of @xmath20 .",
    "however , one is now faced with the problem of obtaining large enough flux at this large a distance .",
    "we can make @xmath9 independent of @xmath0 by choosing either @xmath40 or @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the magic baseline uses the first condition which holds true for both nh and ih for the same @xmath23 and is independent of @xmath22 .",
    "the dependence of the second condition on @xmath23 and @xmath22 is different for nh and ih .",
    "we exploit this difference by choosing @xmath23 and @xmath22 such that @xmath42 holds for ih .",
    "this makes @xmath9 for ih not only independent of @xmath0 but also very small because only the @xmath43 term in eq .",
    "( [ pmue ] ) survives .",
    "we impose the simultaneous demand that , for the same @xmath23 and @xmath22 , @xmath9 for nh should be close to maximum .",
    "this leads to a substantial difference in @xmath9 for nh and ih and enables us to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy for all values of @xmath0 , even for relatively small values of @xmath3 .",
    "the condition on @xmath9 for ih translates into @xmath44 whereas that for nh becomes @xmath45 . solving the above two equations , we get @xmath46 km and @xmath25 gev , for @xmath47 ev@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath23 is determined purely by @xmath37 whereas @xmath22 is determined by both @xmath37 and @xmath17 .",
    "there is an uncertainty in @xmath23 which is equal to the uncertainty in @xmath37 .    the large difference between nh and ih is illustrated in fig .  1 , where we have plotted @xmath9 as a function of @xmath22 for @xmath48 .",
    "the figure shows @xmath9 as a band with @xmath0 spanning the entire @xmath49 range , for both nh and ih . as claimed above , in the neighbourhood of @xmath25 gev",
    ", @xmath9 is about @xmath50 for all @xmath0 for ih whereas it is @xmath51 to @xmath52 times larger ( depending on @xmath0 ) in the case of nh .",
    "this large difference can be measured if there is a substantial neutrino flux at @xmath25 gev .",
    "note that the value of @xmath5 chosen here is very small and is barely above the detectable limit of the experiments under construction .",
    "but even for such small values of @xmath3 , the configuration suggested here can make a distinction between nh and ih , _ independent of @xmath0 and using neutrino beam only_. it is worth remarking that @xmath53 km is the distance between the brookhaven laboratory and the homestake goldmine @xcite .",
    "the design for a neutrino superbeam , with flux peaking near @xmath54 gev , already exists .",
    "for example : numi beam with medium energy option at locations @xmath55mr off - axis , has its peak flux at @xmath56 gev @xcite .    in this letter , we consider the following configuration .",
    "we assume that the @xmath57 source is located at brookhaven which produces a numi - like beam with @xmath58 megawatt beam power .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath59 protons on target ( pot ) , with energy 120 gev , per year @xcite .",
    "we assume a @xmath60 kton water cerenkov detector at homestake @xmath53 km away .",
    "we also assume that the orientation of the beamline is such that the detector location is @xmath55mr off - axis . in our calculations ,",
    "we take the numi fluxes and scale them appropriately to obtain the event numbers at this distance and for this off axis location @xcite .",
    "our signal is electron appearance in the far detector , due to @xmath61 oscillations .",
    "single @xmath62 events produced by neutral current interactions form a potentially huge background to this signal .",
    "the visible energy of the neutral current events is usually much smaller than the true energy of the neutrino and hence they can be suppressed by a large factor @xcite .",
    "the remainder of these neutral current events , together with the electron events produced by beam @xmath63 form the actual background .",
    "this background was estimated in a previous study to be about @xmath64 of the unoscillated events @xcite .",
    "we include this background in our study .",
    "we calculate the event rates for the energy range @xmath65 gev , in bins of width @xmath66 gev and smear the obtained event distribution with a gaussian probability in energy with @xmath67 .",
    "we define the statistical @xmath68 between the event distribution for nh and that for ih , by @xmath69 @xmath70 is the number of events for the * true * hierarchy plus the number of background events .",
    "@xmath71 is the number of events for the * test * hierarchy , which is the opposite of the true hierarchy , plus the number of background events .",
    "the true hierarchy can be either nh or ih and we consider both possibilities . in calculating the event distributions , the following values of neutrino parameters",
    "are used : @xmath72 ev@xmath31 , @xmath47 ev@xmath31 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we do the calculation for various different input values of @xmath5 starting from @xmath75 and going down to @xmath76 in steps of @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath0 is varied from @xmath78 to @xmath79 in steps of @xmath80 .",
    "we also assume a @xmath81 systematic uncertainty in the neutrino flux and a similar uncertainty in detector systematics . the systematic uncertainty in the cross section is taken to be @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "these are taken into account through the method of pulls as described in @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the fluxes , cross sections etc are taken to be the central values in the computation of @xmath70 but are allowed to deviate from their central values in the computation of @xmath71 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath83 input deviates from its central value by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the uncertainty in this input .",
    "then the value of @xmath71 with the changed inputs is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the expected number of events in bin @xmath88 for the * test * hierarchy , calculated using the central values of the fluxes , cross sections etc and npull is the number of inputs which have systematic uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath89 s are called the _ pull _ variables and they determine the number of @xmath90 s by which the @xmath83 input deviates from its central value . in eq .",
    "( [ cij ] ) , @xmath91 is the change in @xmath71 when the @xmath83 input is changed by @xmath85 ( _ i.e. _  by 1 standard deviation ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the inputs are not very large .",
    "therefore , in eq .",
    "( [ cij ] ) we consider only those changes in @xmath71 which are linear in @xmath89 .",
    "thus we have a modified @xmath68 defined by @xmath92 ^ 2}{n_i^{tr } } + \\sum^{npull}_{k=1}\\ ; \\xi_k^2    \\label{chisqxik}\\ ] ] where the additional term @xmath93 is the penalty imposed for moving @xmath83 input away from its central value by @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath68 with pulls , which includes the effects of all theoretical and systematic uncertainties , is obtained by minimizing @xmath94 , given in eq .",
    "( [ chisqxik ] ) , with respect to all the pulls @xmath89 : @xmath95 . \\label{chisqpull}\\ ] ]    in addition to taking the systematic uncertainties into account , we have marginalized over @xmath96 , @xmath5 , @xmath97 and @xmath0 but held @xmath16 and @xmath98 fixed . in doing the marginalization",
    ", we assume that experimental uncertainties in @xmath96 and @xmath99 are what they are expected to be from t2k ( about @xmath81 ) @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the marginalization over @xmath96 has on @xmath68 no effect but marginalization over @xmath100 has a very significant effect , if ih happens to be the true hierarchy .",
    "we elucidate this point after discussing our results .",
    "the dominant term in @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath5 , which makes the marginalization over @xmath3 the most crucial one in hierarchy determination . in the neighbourhood of oscillation maximum",
    ", the matter effects increase this term for nh and decrease it for ih , relative to its vacuum value . in shorter baseline experiments such as no@xmath10a",
    ", one expects to measure this increase / decrease and determine the hierarchy . however , it is possible to choose a @xmath101 , within the allowed range of @xmath3 , such that @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , marginalization over @xmath3 leads to a very small @xmath68 . in our proposal ,",
    "the condition @xmath42 , makes @xmath9(ih ) very small , in the neighbourhood of @xmath25 gev , * independent of both @xmath0 and @xmath3*. in this energy range , @xmath9(nh ) is close to oscillation maximum .",
    "it is also proportional to @xmath5 and is quite large even for the very small value of @xmath5 , which is illustrated in fig .  1",
    ". therefore the oscillation pattern is very distinctive for each hierarchy and they can easily be distinguished for @xmath103 .",
    "we also note that the marginalization over @xmath0 ensures that this distinction between nh and ih exists even for the most unfavourable value of @xmath0 .",
    "hence hierarchy determination is possible for the * whole range of @xmath0 . *    because of its importance , marginalization over @xmath5 was done in different stages . at present , we only have an upper limit , @xmath104 .",
    "double chooz @xcite can measure this parameter if it is @xmath105 and daya bay @xcite can measure it for values @xmath106 . therefore , for input values @xmath107 ( that is if double chooz finds a positive result ) , we do marginalization only over this range . for input values @xmath108 ( expecting a positive result from daya bay but not from double chooz ) we do marginalization only over this restricted range .",
    "it was mentioned above that the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath98 are kept fixed .",
    "these parameters occur only in the second and third terms of @xmath9 .",
    "given the smallness of @xmath109 , the third term is very small and varying @xmath16 and @xmath98 within their ranges , changes this term by a very small amount .",
    "the second term undergoes much larger changes when @xmath110 and @xmath0 are varied over their ranges .",
    "the change due to @xmath16 and @xmath98 is much smaller and can be neglected .",
    "in our calculations , we assumed that only the neutrino beam is used .",
    "neutrino beams have an advantage over the anti - neutrino beams because of the larger cross section and hence larger statistics . in table  1",
    ", we list the exposure , in kiloton - years ( kt - yr ) , needed to obtain a @xmath111 distinction between nh and ih if @xmath112 . in this case , one requires only minimal exposure ( less than 10 kt - yr ) to distinguish the two hierarchies .",
    "this is independent of whether the true hierarchy is nh or ih . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the results are shown in table  2 . here the needed exposure , for @xmath111 distinction , sharply goes up with @xmath3 from @xmath55 kt - yr to @xmath114 kt - yr , if nh is the true hierarchy .",
    "if ih is the true hierarchy , the @xmath111 exposure becomes about @xmath115 kt - yr .",
    ".exposure in kiloton - years required for @xmath116 hierarchy discrimination in the case where both double chooz and daya bay see a positive signal .",
    "second ( third ) column shows the results if nh ( ih ) is the true hierarchy . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have highlighted some very interesting properties of a 2540 km baseline experiment and showed , through a simple numerical calculation , that such an experiment is well capable of determining neutrino mass hierarchy . in our calculations , we have included a conservative estimate of background , which we take to be @xmath64 of the unoscillated events . despite such background , the setup we discussed is capable of hierarchy discrimination for even quite small values of @xmath3 . by imposing various kinematic cuts ,",
    "the background can be suppressed at the cost of loss of some signal .",
    "this loss of signal can be compensated by having an increased exposure .",
    "however , the ability of the setup to determine the mass hierarchy will not be compromised because any such kinematic cut will lead to a larger signal to background ratio .",
    "in this letter we demonstrated the superior ability of a neutrino superbeam experiment with a baseline 2540 km , whose flux peaks in the energy range 3 - 4 gev , to determine neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "for @xmath112 , a very modest exposure of @xmath117 kiloton - years is sufficient to distinguish the two hiearchies at @xmath111 level . for @xmath2",
    ", one needs an exposure @xmath118 kiloton - years .",
    "these exposures are obtained analyzing the expected data from this superbeam set up only .",
    "if the data from this set up is analyzed in conjunction with the data from a reactor @xmath3 measurement experiment , then the required exposures are likely to be much less .",
    "the set up we assumed is not hard to realize because 2540 km is the distance from brookhaven to homestake and the technology for an accelerator beam , with peak flux in 3 - 4 gev range , exists @xcite .",
    "such a set up , we believe , will have an excellent capability to measure not only small values of @xmath3 but @xmath0 as well .",
