    "semiconductor spintronics has recently received a lot of attention following the successful demonstration of spin injection from a diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms)@xcite to a nonmagnetic semiconductor ( nms).@xcite this enables the realization of all - semiconductor spintronics , which potentially can lead to the development of multi - functional devices based on optical and transport processes that make use of both the charge and spin degrees of freedom . however , in order to realize spintronic devices , several prerequisites need to be generally satisfied and achieved : i ) efficient creation and injection of spin polarized carriers , ii ) transport of the spin - polarized electrons from one location in the device to another , iii ) successful manipulation of the spin current signal , iv ) efficient detection of the spin - polarized electrons .    while the electron spin is of central importance in the understanding and design of semiconductor spintronics , the charge of the electron and its influence on spin transport can not be neglected .",
    "charge carrier interactions , drift and diffusion are expected in any realistic system due to externally applied , or intrinsic , built - in electric fields , doping concentration variations and material design .",
    "it has been previously shown by yu and flatt ( yf ) that the spin diffusion length depends on the magnitude and sign of the electric field.@xcite such a dependence was recently experimentally observed.@xcite it has also been shown experimentally that spin - polarized transport and injection is very sensitive to an applied bias voltage,@xcite as well as different structural parameters such as doping concentrations@xcite and layer thicknesses.@xcite these considerations pose the fundamental question : what is the influence of purely electrical effects on spin injection , transport and detection in semiconductor spintronics ?    here we show that the the spin diffusion length may have a dramatic dependence on electric field _",
    "gradients _ , an effect that can be significantly stronger than the electric field effects predicted by yf.@xcite in essence , our theoretical and numerical study predicts that even small deviations from charge neutrality can give rise to significant enhancement or suppression of spin polarization .",
    "previously , it has been assumed that the effects of inhomogeneous fields , such as , e.g. , occurring at material or doping concentration interfaces , should be relatively small , since the charge screening length typically is much shorter than the spin diffusion length .",
    "we show that the effective spin diffusion length in fact can be comparable to the screening length in the presence of inhomogeneous electric fields . in particular , we study the propagation of spin polarized electrons across interfaces between regions with different doping concentrations .",
    "the spin polarization of electrons moving from a region with lower to a region with higher doping concentration is found to be strongly suppressed due to the electric field gradient effect .",
    "conversely , electric field gradients may enhance the spin diffusion length , depending on their sign and magnitude .",
    "our results show that purely electrical effects may have a profound impact on spin injection , spin transport , and spin detection , three key ingredients for the realization of semiconductor spintronics . a generalized drift - diffusion equation which is able to describe nonequilibrium spin density propagation in the presence of inhomogeneous electric fields",
    "is derived and verified with numerical calculations using the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) .",
    "we note that recent theoretical studies by , e.g. , wang and wu@xcite and sherman,@xcite have also predicted very interesting effects related to electric - field induced spin relaxation mechanisms due to the rashba effect .    in the following",
    ", we will first describe our self - consistent numerical approach ( section [ numerics ] ) , followed by numerical results from which the strong influence of electric fields on spin transport will become evident ( section [ results ] ) .",
    "subsequently , in section [ ddequations ] we derive spin drift - diffusion equations which are then used to discuss and understand the numerically observed characteristics ( section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in order to fully understand spin transport properties in semiconductor structures , and in particular the influence of interfaces and inhomogeneous electric fields , we take into account nonequilibrium transport processes for _ both _ the _ charge _ and _ spin _ degrees of freedom in a self - consistent way . in our approach , the transport of spin - polarized electrons is described by two bte equations according to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an inhomogeneous electric field , @xmath2 is the electron distribution for the spin - up ( down ) electrons , @xmath3 is the momentum relaxation time , and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the rate at which spin - up ( spin - down ) electrons scatter to spin - down ( spin - up ) electrons . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bte ] ) describes the relaxation of each nonequilibrium spin distribution to a local equilibrium ( spin - dependent ) electron distribution function , @xmath6 , which we choose as non - degenerate according to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lattice temperature .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ bte ] ) describes the relaxation of the spin polarization . from the distribution function @xmath9",
    "we calculate the local spin density according to @xmath10 and define two quantities , the spin density _ imbalance _",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the densities of spin - up and spin - down polarized electrons , and the spin density _ polarization _ @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total charge density .",
    "inhomogeneous charge distributions and electric fields are taken into account by solving the poisson equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dielectric constant , @xmath18 is the donor concentration profile , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the spatially dependent potential and electric field profiles .",
    "our theoretical model thus goes beyond drift - diffusion , and is capable of describing charge and spin transport through strongly inhomogeneous ( with respect to spin and charge densities ) semiconductor systems , as well as nonequilibrium effects .",
    "we assume in the following that an electric field is applied along the @xmath21 direction and consider the corresponding one - dimensional transport problem .",
    "the nonlinear , coupled equations ( [ bte],[leq],[spindensity],[poisson ] ) need to be solved self - consistently for a given applied bias voltage , doping concentration profile , nonequilibrium spin distributions , and relaxation times .",
    "we use a numerical approach based on finite difference and relaxation methods , that we originally developed for the study of nonequilibrium effects in charge transport through ultrasmall , inhomogeneous semiconductor channels.@xcite as boundary conditions , we adopt the following scheme : for the potential , the values at the system boundaries are fixed to @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 denote the left and right boundary of the sample , respectively ) , corresponding to an externally applied voltage @xmath25 .",
    "electron charge density _ is allowed to fluctuate in the system subject to the condition of _ global _ charge neutrality , which is enforced between each successive iteration in the self - consistent poisson - boltzmann loop .",
    "the _ spin density _ at the dms boundary and in the dms is determined by the degree of polarization @xmath26 , for which the density is defined according to @xmath27 . in the calculations ,",
    "the size of the contacts has to be large enough , such that the electric field deep inside the contacts is constant and low .",

    "the system is inhomogeneous with respect to both charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "spin - polarized electrons , with @xmath32 , are injected from a diluted magnetic semiconductor(dms)-like portion,@xcite defined for @xmath33 , into a nonmagnetic semiconductor ( nms ) part .",
    "the spin - polarized electrons subsequently relax due to spin - flip scattering for @xmath34 , at the rate @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 ) , to the asymptotic unpolarized value @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the doping concentration is defined as @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",

    "in the following , we present numerical results for a spin and charge inhomogeneous semiconductor structure and highlight the characteristics of electric field effects on the spin polarization . in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we study the propagation of spin - polarized electrons across two spin- and charge - inhomogeneous interfaces , separated by @xmath53 @xmath51 m ( grey mid - region ) , as a function of different doping concentrations @xmath54 . in fig .",

    "the lowest solid and dashed curves correspond to @xmath59 and @xmath56 of a charge homogeneous sample , @xmath60 , in which the electric field is accordingly constant , as shown by the thick , solid line in fig.[figure2](d ) .",
    "in contrast to the constant total charge density ( bottom dashed line ) , for the charge homogeneous case , the spin density imbalance , @xmath61 ( bottom solid line ) , decreases monotonically for @xmath34 , which coincides with the position of the dms / nms interface and the onset of the spin flip scattering rate @xmath35 . the decay is exponential and can be understood in terms of the drift - diffusion description in the yf model.@xcite within this model , the spin density imbalance decay can be described by @xmath62 $ ] where @xmath63 and where , @xmath64 are electric - field dependent spin diffusion lengths , describing spin propagation antiparallel ( parallel ) to the electric field . in eq .",

    "( [ spindiff ] ) it follows that the spin - diffusion length is _ enhanced _ in the direction anti - parallel to an applied electric field and _ suppressed _ in the direction parallel to the field.@xcite our numerical results agree with these considerations for the homogeneous system .    for increasing @xmath54 ,",
    "the total charge density , @xmath56 , naturally increases monotonically for @xmath67 , reaching @xmath68 on the order of a screening length to the right of the doping interface .",
    "the spin density imbalance @xmath61 , however , has a more complicated behavior . at the interface between the two doping regions , defined at @xmath69 , a sharp increase of @xmath61",
    "is observed , which subsequently peaks below the maximum value of @xmath56 , followed by a monotonic decay .",
    "similar spin accumulation was recently reported by pershin and privman.@xcite we note and emphasize , however , that the _ spin accumulation peak is significantly lower _ than the maximum value of @xmath56 around the doping interface , e.g. , for the @xmath70 m@xmath49 sample , @xmath59 reaches only @xmath71 of the corresponding value in @xmath56 .    for @xmath72 , when electrons are injected from a high to a low doping region , the situation is reversed . in fig .",

    "the observed increase ( decrease ) of @xmath61 with increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath54 can at first order be understood in terms of the large difference between the intrinsic spin relaxation length , @xmath75 , and the debye screening length , @xmath76 .",
    "the screening length is generally shorter than the spin relaxation length .",
    "for example , for the range of doping concentrations considered here , we find @xmath77 @xmath51 m , whereas @xmath78 @xmath51 m .",
    "the spin density imbalance can be written in terms of @xmath79 . since @xmath80 , the total charge density , @xmath56 , will increase ( decrease ) faster than @xmath13 with increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath54 .",
    "hence , one would expect the spatial dependence of @xmath56 to dominate @xmath73 within a screening length of the doping interface .",
    "this is clearly seen by comparison between @xmath81 ( solid lines ) and @xmath56 ( dashed lines ) in figs .",
    "[ figure2](a , b ) .    for @xmath82",
    ", @xmath61 is seen to decrease exponentially .",
    "furthermore , the decay rate is larger for increasing doping concentrations @xmath54 .",
    "one can understand this spatial dependence from previous arguments and the model of yf . for @xmath82 the total charge density @xmath56 and the electric field",
    "is constant ( and thus we can apply the yf model ) and the spin - flip scattering drives the nonequilibrium spin density distribution exponentially toward equilibrium , @xmath83 on a length scale given by eq .",
    "( [ spindiff ] ) .",
    "since an increase in @xmath54 gives rise to a decrease of the electric field in that region [ see fig .",
    "[ figure2](d ) for the electric profiles ] the spin diffusion length correspondingly decreases consistent with the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ spindiff ] ) , giving rise to a faster decay of the spin density imbalance .    the description provided by eq .",
    "( [ spindiff ] ) , however , fails to describe the magnitude , as well as the spatial dependence of @xmath84 around the doping interface .",
    "for example , considering first the curves with @xmath85 , for @xmath86 , @xmath61 follows the spatial profile of @xmath56 rather closely around the interface region .",
    "surprisingly , with increasing @xmath54 , the maximum value reached by @xmath73 becomes increasingly smaller than @xmath54 , and the spin density imbalance thus gets strongly suppressed .",
    "this is an unexpected finding , and in contradiction the yf model and with eq .",
    "( [ spindiff ] ) , since , according to this equation , a strong built - in negativ field , such as shown in fig .  [",
    "figure2](d ) , around the doping interface should enhance the spin diffusion length significantly and hence , should yield @xmath87 until the electric field drops again for @xmath88 .",
    "this discrepancy is also well illustrated in the spin density _ polarization _",
    ", @xmath89 , shown in fig.[figure2](c ) .",
    "although , as naively expected , @xmath90 drops sharply around the interface due to the sharp rise in @xmath56 , the _ dependence _ on @xmath54 is in contradiction with eq .",
    "( [ spindiff ] ) due to the following : an increase in @xmath54 , yields a sharp increase of @xmath91 around the interface [ see fig.[figure2](d ) ] , and should therefore lead to a significant increase of the `` downstream '' spin diffusion length , @xmath92 , according to eq .",
    "( [ spindiff ] ) .",
    "thus , an increase in @xmath54 should be beneficial for @xmath61 and @xmath89 , in contradiction to our findings . for @xmath72 , a similar unexpected dependence on @xmath54",
    "is observed .",
    "clearly , one needs to go beyond the yf model ( which is valid for a system with local charge neutrality ) in order to understand spin polarized transport in the presence of inhomogeneous electric fields . as we will discuss below ,",
    "the sign and magnitude of the electric field and electric field gradients around the interface are crucial for determining the magnitude and spatial dependence of the spin density imbalance and polarization around the doping interface .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the unexpected spatial dependence of @xmath89 and @xmath93 , can be obtained by reexamining the spin drift - diffusion equations .",
    "previous works have mainly focused on the charge homogeneous case.@xcite this is a natural assumption since the screening length is expected to be much shorter than the intrinsic spin relaxation length , leading one to assume quasi - local charge neutrality . however , as we will show below , corrections to the spin drift - diffusion equations of yf@xcite yield that even quasi - local deviations from charge neutrality can have a very strong impact on the spin polarization .    in the following ,",

    "it is thus seen that the drift - diffusion length depends strongly on the _ gradient _ of the electric field ; consequently , the spin density imbalance and polarization decay lengths are enhanced or suppressed based not only on the sign of the electric field alone.@xcite on the contrary , depending on the profile of the electric field , the gradient term in eq .",
    "( [ ldu ] ) can either enhance or suppress the spin - polarization propagation significantly , as seen explicitly in our calculated results in fig .",
