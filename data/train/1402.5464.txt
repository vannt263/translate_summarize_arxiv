    "bl lac objects are an important , extreme sub - class of agn . the large numbers of bl lacs being detected in the gamma - rays by the _ fermi _",
    "lat @xcite show that these blazars are a dominant contributor to the gev sky .",
    "this flux - limited gamma - ray sample also provides a unique opportunity to probe the evolution of the bl lac phenomenon over cosmic time @xcite .",
    "bl lac evolution is controversial , with various authors finding negative ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , positive ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or negligible evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "much of this uncertainty stems from the difficulty in determining redshifts ; for many bl lacs the high jet - associated continuum flux dominates emission from any broad - line region and results in very low equivalent width for galactic host absorption features .",
    "despite intensive spectroscopic campaigns @xcite this often precludes direct bl lac redshift measurement , challenging their utility for population and evolution studies @xcite .",
    "thus alternate methods of estimating or constraining the source redshift can be quite valuable @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we image _ fermi _ bl lacs to search for host flux in the wings of the nuclear point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "our targets are drawn from the ` 2lac ' @xcite lat blazars for which sensitive spectroscopy , reported in @xcite , shows them to be continuum - dominated bl lacs at very high significance , but was not able to determine a redshift .",
    "since hosts are increasingly difficult to detect at high redshift , we excluded bl lacs whose spectra showed intervening absorbers requiring @xmath4 or excluded continuum flux from hosts at lower @xmath5 ; this left 226 targets .",
    "we observed objects from this list when conditions and gaps in other observing programs allowed .",
    "it has been argued that bl lac hosts are nearly uniform giant ellipticals with @xmath6 = @xmath322.5 @xcite .",
    "thus several authors have used such imaging to constrain the source redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one can also search for the elliptical flux in high s / n spectra ; when not detected this provides a lower limit on the redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , when direct spectroscopic redshifts measurements are in hand ( or later become available ) , the flux measurements can be used to test the standard candle hypothesis and the evolution of the bl lac hosts . here",
    ", we follow the method described by @xcite , although we use an updated host magnitude calibration derived from absorption lines features measured in a deep spectroscopic survey @xcite .",
    "our typical bl lac has a total magnitude of @xmath7 . we wish to model our individual image point spread function ( psf ) , following the wings to well below the sky brightness , and to test the psf model against a number of stars with flux comparable to that of the bl lac core .",
    "thus we need moderate field imaging with good natural seeing . for this program we used the mini - mosaic ( minimo ) camera at the wiyn 3.6 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory and the soar optical imager ( soi ) at the soar 4.2 m telescope on cerro pachon .",
    "individual exposures ( @xmath8s@xmath9s ) were adjusted to minimize the core saturation ; the pointing was dithered between exposures .",
    "all data were taken using an sdss i@xmath10 filter .",
    "observations with minimo were made on the nights of september 26 - 27 , 2011 and february 17 - 18 , 2012 .",
    "the mosaic image consists of two @xmath11 chips , with a plate scale of 0.141@xmath12/pixel , separated by a 7.8@xmath12 gap .",
    "this gives a field of 9.6 arcmin@xmath139.6 arcmin .",
    "observations with soi were made on the nights of march 21 - 23 , 2012 .",
    "the soi mosaic also has two @xmath11 chips , again split by a 7.12@xmath12 gap .",
    "seeing was only moderate quality during the run , so we observed with 2x2 binning , for a plate scale of 0.153@xmath12/binned pixel and a 5.2 arcmin@xmath135.2 arcmin fov .",
    "we targeted 5 dithered exposures for each object .",
    "we generally suffered significant core saturation for the brighter bl lacs .",
    "@xcite analyzed high s / n spectra of a large number of _ fermi _ bl lacs . in a method parallel to the present imaging host search , they detected or placed limits on the bl lac host by measuring the flux of a spectral component from a standard candle elliptical .",
    "after appropriate k - correction and slit - loss corrections , these measurements provided host redshift estimates or lower bounds .",
    "in addition , sometimes intervening metal line absorption systems were detected .",
    "these provide firm , model - independent lower bounds on the host redshift .",
    "these spectroscopically allowed ranges and lower bounds are listed in the last column of table 2 ; we give here the ranges derived for a standard candle magnitude @xmath6 = -22.5 , for consistency with our imaging results .",
    "since in this program we targeted bl lacs without known redshift , none of our sources has a spectroscopic @xmath5 in @xcite .",
    "for the five sources with host detection , two ( j0316 + 0904 and j0543@xmath35532 ) have imaging redshift estimates consistent with the spectra - derived bounds in that paper ; the low significance detection of j1023@xmath34336 is also consistent .",
    "three ( j0114 + 1325 , j0115 + 2519 , and j0721 + 7120 ) lie at slightly lower @xmath5 than the spectral lower bound , but are within 3@xmath14 , and j0115 + 2519 is fully consistent with the strict lower limit provided by an intervening absorber .",
    "however , since completing this study @xcite have published new high quality vlt / x - shooter spectra of a number of blazars , including j0543@xmath35532 , measured here . for this source , they infer @xmath15 based on a weak ca ii h / k doublet and a na i absorption line .",
    "this redshift , near the lower bound of @xcite is well below our imaging estimate , implying a host that is substantially fainter than our standard candle assumption . at this @xmath5",
    "our measured host flux implies an absolute magnitude @xmath16 , @xmath17mag ( @xmath18 ) away from our assumed standard candle luminosity .",
    "the host absolute magnitude is consistent with , but more accurate than , the spectroscopically estimated value in @xcite .    in six cases",
    "we derive lower bounds on the redshift ; j1023@xmath34336 may be interpreted as a lower bound of @xmath19 .",
    "these limits are always more constraining than those extracted from the spectroscopic study . for j0558@xmath37459",
    "our new bound is also stronger than that obtained from the intervening absorption line system .",
    "thus these bounds may be useful in bl lac population studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with median @xmath20",
    "our sources are very strongly dominated by the non - thermal nuclear core flux .",
    "this is in contrast to the hst study of @xcite , where of 69 bl lacs with resolved hosts , 37 had @xmath21 .",
    "our large core dominance is similar to that found in @xcite and , as noted there , it may be attributed to the fact that these are gamma - ray selected bl lacs and thus should have high alignment between the jet axis and the earth line - of - sight , increasing the core dominance . in addition , these sources were drawn from the bl lacs lacking redshifts even after extensive spectroscopy with 8m - class facilities @xcite . since sources with brighter hosts allow easier absorption line redshift measurements , the remainder ( including the sources studied here ) should have an especially high core dominance .    in previous studies",
    "@xcite the bl lacs were seen to have an excess of faint galactic companions , indicating that they were located in cluster environments and that they may have recent interaction activity . in general , the relatively poor seeing and modest image depth achieved during this project prevented us from identifying very faint companions . for 2 objects ,",
    "we did find bright companion galaxies nearby .",
    "j0114 + 1325 had two companions within a 3@xmath12 ( @xmath22kpc ) radius .",
    "these companions were close enough that they overlap significantly with the bl lac host wings , making accurate flux measurement difficult ; we found their i@xmath10 magnitudes to be roughly 20.5 and 20.8 .",
    "j0222 + 4302 had 4 surrounding bright companions located 11@xmath23 ( @xmath24kpc ) from the core , with i@xmath10 magnitudes of 18.9 , 19.3 , 19.5 , and 20.9 .",
    "we have detected hosts in the images of 5/11 bl lacs , plus one marginal detection . assuming a standard candle host luminosity these provided redshift estimates @xmath25 ( @xmath26 = 0.37 ) .",
    "the minimum redshifts for the remainder are also larger than available spectroscopic lower limits and so are useful , as well .",
    "perhaps unsurprisingly , our host detections were for four hbls ( high spectral peak energy , relatively low luminosity ) sources and one intermediate peak source .",
    "the other intermediate peak sources and the two lbls ( low peak , higher power ) sources in our sample yielded only lower limits on @xmath5 ; these include the highest limit , @xmath27 in this sample .",
    "when no other redshift estimate is available , these imaging - derived values can be useful for statistical purposes , e.g. in population studies .",
    "however , as emphasized by the spectroscopic @xmath5 recently derived for j0543@xmath35532 , the standard candle hypothesis is only statistically useful , at best , and should be subject to further study . indeed @xcite estimate that two of their bl lac hosts have @xmath28 , even further from the expected standard candle value .",
    "our host flux measurements thus remain useful whenever an independent redshift is derived .",
    "the prospects for further spectroscopic redshifts of our imaged hosts are , in fact , good ; these are excellent targets for spatially resolved spectroscopy , especially with integral field unit ( ifu ) feeds , which can isolate host spectral features from the wings of the bl lac .",
