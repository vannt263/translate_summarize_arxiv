    "in particular , the screening of the interaction and the polarization function can assume different forms depending on the number of filled landau levels and the degree of disorder .",

    "to lowest order in the screened interlayer interaction , the transconductivity of a pair of coupled two - dimensional electron gases is expressible in terms of three - body correlation functions , @xmath86 , called triangle functions , which depend on the microscopic details of each system . in this paper",

    "we have illustrated how the interplay between the screened interlayer _",
    "interaction and the phase - space available for scattering leads to non - trivial behavior of the transresistivity as a function of both magnetic field , where the characteristic is the twin - peak structure , and temperature dependence , where @xmath173 should have a maximum at a temperature related to the width of the landau levels .    the results presented above",
    "are based on a relatively simple model for the polarization and screening functions .",
    "we argue that this model is applicable as long as an independent electron picture describes the individual layers , and should in that regime give qualitatively correct results when the landau levels are fully resolved .",
    "whereas the specific models for the polarization and screening functions break down at higher magnetic fields and/or lower temperatures , the general expression for the transconductivity in terms of the triangle functions remains valid ( in the absence of interlayer correlations ) and is open to improvements .",
