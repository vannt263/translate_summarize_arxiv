    "one of the basic activities of a spiral galaxy like our own milky way is the continual collection of diffuse and fragmented gas and dust clouds into giant clouds of molecules , which in turn produce stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this takes place as part of a cycle of matter between the stars and the gas , driven by energy flows arising from radiation and mass loss from stars , and the dynamical motions of the gas in the gravitating interstellar medium .",
    "cloud formation occurs as the gas cools and the density rises , first as atomic clouds , then as molecular clouds .",
    "clouds coalesce , cooling is enhanced due to molecule formation as radiation is shielded from their interior , and star formation initiated as gravitational collapse is triggered inside .",
    "determination of the spatial structure and the kinematics of the gas as it transitions between the phases of the gas is needed to discern how clouds are formed .",
    "while the hydrogen gas can be seen from the atomic phase through its principal 21 cm emission line , its measurement does not distinguish between the warm and cold phases , only providing the total column density of the atomic gas . in the molecular phase the bulk component  hydrogen molecules ",
    "can not be seen at all , remaining unexcited in their ground state at the typical @xmath9k temperatures found in molecular clouds .",
    "trace species in the gas are thus needed with emission lines that are sensitive to the excitation conditions in the gas , to follow the thermal and chemical transitions that occur .",
    "after helium ( which is inert ) and oxygen ( whose key lines are blocked by the earth s atmosphere ) , carbon is the next most abundant element in the universe .",
    "carbon can be found in ionized ( c@xmath6 ) , atomic ( c ) and molecular ( co  carbon monoxide ) forms in the bulk of the dense interstellar medium .",
    "all of these species are readily excited in the prevailing conditions , with emission lines produced in the terahertz portion of the spectrum for c and c@xmath6 ( @xmath10thz ) , and the millimeter portion for co ( 3 mm @xmath11  thz ) .",
    "co is readily measured from good observatory sites . c and c@xmath6 are , however , virtually unobservable from all but the driest sites on the surface of our planet .",
    "we have established a new observatory at ridge a , near the summit of the antarctic plateau , to open up the terahertz spectrum for observation in order to obtain the wide - field , high resolution images of the carbon lines needed to pursue this science @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the key diagnostic lines from all these species in the atomic and molecular phases of interstellar medium we call `` following the galactic carbon trail '' .    in this paper",
    "we present wide - field data from the mopra telescope in australia , obtained as part of the southern galactic plane co survey @xcite and the heat ( high elevation antarctic terahertz ) telescope at ridge a in antarctica of atomic carbon , aimed at pursuing this objective .",
    "the data covers roughly 1 square degree along the g328 sightline through the galactic plane ( i.e.  @xmath3 ) . in particular , we have examined the data set to determine whether there is evidence for dark molecular gas present .",
    "this is defined here as regions exhibiting [ ci ]  emission but without corresponding co line emission .",
    "practically , since there are no clear regions where [ ci ]  is present but co is not detected in the moderate beam sizes used ( 2 arcmin for the [ ci ] ) , we search for regions of emission where the [ c / co ] abundance may be enhanced",
    ".    such regions of gas may be expected in the surfaces of molecular clouds .",
    "these are photodissociation regions ( pdrs ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and within extinctions of @xmath12mags .",
    "from the atomic surface , self - shielding may allow significant columns of h@xmath7 to exist .",
    "however the co abundance will be greatly reduced from the cloud interior , being photodissociated by the far - uv radiation that heats and drives the chemistry inside the pdr .",
    "since co is the normal tracer used to indicate the presence of molecular gas , such gas is `` dark '' to standard survey techniques . in these molecular cloud envelopes the carbon",
    "will instead be found as either c or c@xmath6 , and so be amenable to detection through thz frequency observations .",
    "@xcite model the fraction of such a dark component that exists in giant molecular clouds , suggesting that it comprises about one - third of the molecular gas , in good agreement with the estimates of the dark gas fraction from gamma - ray observations @xcite . in these and",
    "previous cloud models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the [ ci ]  emission arises mostly from gas where the hydrogen exists as h@xmath7 but without significant co present .",
    "thus [ ci ]  line emission can be used to trace the dark molecular gas .",
    "furthermore , small molecular clouds , here defined as those with total column densities such that @xmath13 , would not be found at all in co surveys",
    ". a population of such clouds could remain unseen without a corresponding carbon - line survey to detect their presence .",
    "there is also the possibility of dark atomic gas , where 21 cm hi is optically thick and so its line intensity under - estimates the gas column .",
    "analysis of the planck satellite data , comparing the optical depth of the dust emission at 353ghz to the column of the hi derived from its 21 cm line emission , suggests that such clouds may be widespread across the galaxy .",
    "this can occur when the atomic gas is cold ( @xmath14k ) , through absorption of background continuum .",
    "@xcite examine this further for atomic clouds within a few hundred parsecs of the sun , but out of the galactic plane .",
    "they suggest that , if the column density derived from the dust is indeed all atomic , then there are extensive regions where @xmath15 is below 35k , with optical depths @xmath16 as high as 3.0 ; i.e.  dark atomic gas .",
    "carbon would exist as either c or c@xmath6 in such atomic clouds ( but not as co ) , and so emission from the thz frequency lines of these species might be used as a tracer of such gas .",
    "this is especially so in the galactic plane where there is also extensive molecular gas , making it difficult to separate out the dust associated with the atomic component .",
    "by mapping the distribution of carbon along the galactic plane we can therefore estimate where the dark gas may be distributed and how much of it exists within the interstellar medium . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on an analysis of the carbon emission associated with the molecular gas on the galactic sightline that passes through the g328 sector , also comparing it the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath17  and hi line emission .",
    "we describe the observations in  [ sec : obs ] and present the data in  [ sec : results ] . examining the variation of [ c / co ] at the edges of emission features , where the fluxes are smallest ,",
    "presents several challenges so we undertake the analysis through a variety of techniques : flux images (  [ sec : moment ] ) , histograms of line ratio distributions (  [ sec : histograms ] ) , averaged line profiles (  [ sec : profiles ] ) and a relatively new technique : saturation - hue plots (  [ sec : evans ] ) .",
    "we undertake pdr modelling for the molecular environment appropriate for the bulk of the data set in  [ sec : pdr ] , presenting several figures showing line fluxes , optical depths and line ratios as a function of depth into the pdr in  [ sec : pdrmodelplots ] .",
    "we then compare these to the data in  [ sec : discuss ] and summarize the results in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "this is paper ii .",
    "paper i @xcite analyzed this same data set , but just for a narrow velocity range associated with a single molecular filament .",
    "the data analyzed here comes from three separate spectral line surveys conducted along the southern galactic plane , of thz - band [ ci ] , millimetre - band co and centimeter - band hi line emission . the 62 cm heat ( high elevation antarctic terahertz ) telescope has imaged the [ ci ]  809.3ghz line ( @xmath18 ) from ridge a , antarctica , yielding data cubes with @xmath19 and 0.7km / s resolution @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath1  and @xmath17   j=10 emission lines ( 115.3 , 110.2 & 109.8ghz , respectively ) were imaged as part of the 22 m mopra telescope southern galactic plane co survey @xcite , with @xmath20 and 0.1km / s resolution .",
    "the 1.420ghz hi line comes from archival data in the parkes ",

    ". we will generally refer to these lines as simply [ ci ] , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath17  & hi , respectively , in this paper , though sometimes will refer to the [ ci ]  line as [ ci ]  21 to distinguish it from the [ ci ] @xmath21 ( 10 ) line at 492ghz .",
    "we will also include discussion of the [ cii ]  @xmath22 1.90thz line , referred to here simply as [ cii ]  ( and also commonly known as the 158@xmath23 m line ) .",
    "the contiguous data set obtained for the c , co and h lines shown here covers @xmath24@xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "this data set was first presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , where an analysis of the emission from a filamentary feature , approximately 75pc long and 5pc wide , and with only a narrow 2  km / s fwhm in all these spectral lines , was presented , hypothesized to represent a giant molecular cloud in the process of formation . in this paper",
    "we now examine the data from the complete range of velocities covered by these observations with the heat telescope , taking in all of the emission from across the galaxy along this sight line .",
    "the mopra co and sgps hi cubes were re - binned to the same voxel resolution as the heat ci cubes ( both in position and velocity ; i.e.  @xmath19 and 0.7km / s ) .",
    "all cubes were then smoothed with a @xmath19 fwhm gaussian .",
    "the analysis presented here concentrates on examining variations seen in the [ ci]/@xmath1  line ratio in the data cubes .",
    "the @xmath1  line is used in preference to the brighter @xmath0  line in order to minimize complications in interpretation caused by optical depth in the @xmath0  line , as the @xmath1  line is generally optically thin in the mopra co survey .",
    "the full velocity range of the [ ci ] emission extends from @xmath27 to 0 km / s .",
    "three principal features are seen in its averaged spectral profile ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : profiles ] , where the [ ci ]  line is shown together with the co and hi profiles ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : galaxymodel ] shows a schematic model of the galaxy ( adapted from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to aid in the interpretation of these profiles .",
    "the three features correspond to spiral arm crossings at @xmath28 to @xmath29  km / s , @xmath30 to @xmath31  km / s and @xmath32 to @xmath33  km / s , respectively . in turn",
    ", they equate predominantly to emission from the norma spiral arm near- and far- crossings , and the scutum - crux near - crossing along the g328 sight line , at distances of @xmath346 , 10 & 3.5kpc from sun .",
    "in addition , the velocity range from @xmath30 to @xmath35  km / s corresponds to the quiescent filament analyzed in paper i , at @xmath36kpc distance .",
    "the data set is split into these four velocity ranges for the analysis described below .",
    "there is also a weaker feature at @xmath37  km / s arising from the scutum - crux far - arm crossing , @xmath38kpc distant .",
    "a visual rendering of the data cubes for g328 in the four principal lines studied here ( hi , [ ci ] , @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dview ] . here",
    "the velocity dimension is extended along the long axis , and provides a proxy for distance from the sun ( with the proviso of the near - far ambiguity ) .",
    "the three features corresponding to the spiral arm crossings are readily apparent ( norma near- , norma far- and scutum - crux near- , going from left to right ) .",
    "the greater extent of the atomic hydrogen is clear , enveloping the carbon and carbon monoxide emitting gas .",
    "the carbon also gives the impression of being more extended than the carbon monoxide , in - between the distributions for the atomic and the fully molecular gas .",
    "however care needs to be given towards making such an interpretation , as the relative optical depths of the emitting species , as well as the display scales chosen , can result in mis - leading visual appearances . in the rest of this paper we concentrate on a quantitative analysis of the relative distributions of the hydrogen , carbon and carbon monoxide emission to ascertain whether the impression given here is correct , and to explain why and when such a separation can occur .",
    "in this section we first consider the integrated flux images for the co and [ ci ]  lines ( i.e.  zeroth moment images ) in order to compare their morphologies in each of the four velocity ranges . while these show suggestions of a more extended distribution for the [ ci ]  emission than the co this is not conclusive , so we then consider other measures that can probe their relative distributions .",
    "this includes histograms of the distribution of lines ratios and filtering the data to examine averaged profiles from voxels with different values of the [ ci]/co line ratio .",
    "we also present a new method of presentation ( evans plots ) which applies a 2d color table ( hue and saturation ) in order to visualize two variables of interest in such a way that pixels with low signal to noise do not dominate a display of the ratio of two intensities .",
    "integrated flux ( moment 0 ) images over the four velocity ranges are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : momentimages120 ] for both the @xmath1  and [ ci ]   lines , accompanied by an image of the @xmath1  overlaid with [ ci ]  contours .",
    "these images trace the locations of the molecular clouds within three spiral arm crossings along the g328 sight line ( norma far- , norma near- and scutum - crux near- ) , and so are all quite different .",
    "the head of the filamentary structure studied in paper i is to the left of centre of the lowest panel in this figure ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the @xmath1  and [ ci ]  images clearly look similar in each of the velocity ranges .",
    "however their overlay in the third column suggests that the [ ci ]  is , in general , smoother and more extended than in the @xmath1  images . to check that this conclusion is not an artifact of the different original resolutions of the @xmath1  and [ ci ]  data sets the analysis was also repeated with the cubes smoothed by a @xmath40 gaussian rather than @xmath41 .",
    "the same result still holds ( though is not shown here ) , of the [ ci ]  being smoother and more extended than the @xmath1 , though it is not especially striking when seen at this lower angular resolution .",
    "this is as expected if the carbon is wrapped around the molecular gas , as well as being contained within it .",
    "such behaviour would occur if the outer portion of each molecular cloud was lacking in co. however , while suggestive this result can not be regarded as definitive from these images , so we now examine other metrics to probe the relative distributions of the [ ci ]  and co emitting gas .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms ] histograms of selected ratios from the [ ci ] , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath17  and hi lines in the data .",
    "these distributions are determined per voxel ( i.e.  per @xmath19 spatial pixel , 0.7 km / s velocity channel ) . to be included here the data for a [ ci ]  voxel needed to be @xmath42 , whereas for the three co lines we show histograms for thresholds of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these @xmath45 values are determined from the standard deviation of voxels in the continuum portion of the data cubes , @xmath27 to @xmath28km / s . for the hi data ,",
    "for which @xmath45 is not well defined since there are no clear regions of line - free emission in the spectra , but whose signal - to - noise ( s / n ) is much higher than that of the [ ci ]  and co , the threshold was set to an arbitrary value . the number of voxels passing these threshold criteria is listed in table  [ tab : voxels ] , and some statistics on the resulting histograms in fig .  [",
    "fig : histograms ] are listed in table  [ tab : voxelstats ] .",
    "these are given for both the @xmath46 and @xmath47 thresholds applied to the co fluxes .",
    "the mean values and standard deviations for the ratios @xmath0/[ci ] , @xmath1/[ci ]  and @xmath0/@xmath1  are @xmath48 , respectively , when the @xmath46 threshold for co is applied .",
    "the intent here is to search for regions of strong [ ci ]  and weak ( or absent ) co emission , hence the @xmath43 threshold limit applied to the co data .",
    "there is limited dynamic range in the data set , so repeating this analysis with a @xmath44 cut - off for co yields few voxels where the [ ci]/@xmath1  ratio is `` high '' ( as defined below ) .",
    "we do , however , list metrics in table  [ tab : voxelstats ] for the corresponding distributions when a @xmath47 threshold for the co lines is applied . the analysis discussed below yields consistent results with the @xmath46 threshold when this is done , though from far fewer data points .    for @xmath0/[ci ]",
    "the distribution is roughly gaussian , however for all the other line ratios shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms ] this is not the case .",
    "a significant non - gaussian tail exists for larger values of the other line ratios .",
    "this highlights excess voxels where the line ratio is typically about twice the mean value .",
    "the tail is especially evident for the [ ci]/@xmath1  ratio , which has a mean value of @xmath49 and `` high '' values extending to @xmath50 . that the tail is also sensitive to the value of the threshold value used to select the co lines is also apparent from the ( dotted line ) overlays in fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms ] , where the corresponding distribution for [ ci]/@xmath1  for the @xmath47 threshold is almost gaussian in form .",
    "this , of course , means that care is needed in interpreting the data in the tail , as noise fluctuations from voxels with weak fluxes will cause some @xmath1  values to be `` low '' , and hence the corresponding [ ci]/@xmath1  values to be `` high '' . nevertheless , by averaging over voxels where the line ratios are high the s / n",
    "can be improved , allowing us to examine where such voxels tend to be distributed .",
    "we undertake such an analysis in the following section (  [ sec : profiles ] ) .",
    "[ fig : ratiovsflux ] presents a series of scatter plots showing the relationship between the line ratios ( [ ci]/@xmath1 , [ ci]/@xmath0  and @xmath0/@xmath1 ) and the fluxes of the co and [ ci ]  lines , for every voxel in the datacube , where the @xmath47 threshold is applied for the [ ci ]  flux , and @xmath46 for @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "the top panels show the line ratios as a function of the @xmath0  and @xmath1  fluxes , the bottom line as a function of [ ci ]  flux . as these fluxes increase",
    ", the line ratios tend towards roughly constant values , given by [ ci]/@xmath1@xmath51 , [ ci]/@xmath0@xmath52 and @xmath0/@xmath1@xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , as the fluxes decrease , the typical values of these line ratios tend to increase . of course",

    "represents the ratio when the threshold value is applied to the numerator ; i.e.  the [ ci ]  line .",
    "] nevertheless , the median values of the [ ci]/co lines ratios are clearly rising as the co line fluxes decrease .",
    "the overplotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiovsflux ] show the weighted minimum least squares linear fits to the data .",
    "these linear fits are strongly weighted towards lower ratios for the lower fluxes as the s / n is highest for such data points .",
    "hence the fit lines fall below the bulk of the data points . ] .",
    "the weak , but clearly negative slopes , to the fits plotted against the co flux , as well as to [ ci]/@xmath1  vs.  [ ci ] , quantify this relationship ; e.g.   when the @xmath1  flux is 1k in a voxel , the [ ci]/@xmath1  ratio is @xmath54 higher than when it is 3k , and for a [ ci ]  flux of 0.5k in a voxel , the [ ci]/@xmath1  ratio is @xmath55 higher than when it is 1.5k .    the @xmath1  line flux , being generally optically thin , provides a measure of the product @xmath56 , the column density of the co molecules times their filling factor in the beam , whereas for the [ ci ]  flux it is @xmath57  emission is also optically thin .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the pdr models we present later , and was also the case for the analysis given in paper i. ] .",
    "while for any given voxel these factors can not be separated , statistically , as the flux decreases there will be a greater proportion of lower column density regions associated with the corresponding voxels .",
    "we deduce that for these voxels the ratio of the columns of gas in c to co tends to rise , although the total column in both species is lower .",
    "we pick a dividing ratio between `` high '' and `` normal '' of 1.0 for [ ci]/@xmath1  from inspection of the histogram in fig .  [",
    "fig : histograms ] , and then split the data set into two cubes for those voxels that are `` high '' and those that are `` normal '' .",
    "visual inspection of the resulting cubes suggests that `` high '' ratio values are generally found around the edges of co emission regions . however , care is needed over any interpretation of high [ ci]/@xmath1  existing at the peripheries of molecular clouds because these are also the regions where the s / n is lowest since the flux is least .",
    "in particular , the @xmath43 threshold limit applied to the selection of co voxels exacerbates the selection of such voxels at the edges of emitting clouds .",
    "we thus apply a mask to separate the voxels with `` high '' and `` normal '' ratios , and average the resulting cubes to improve the resulting s / n ( data from @xmath58 and @xmath59 voxels are averaged , respectively ) .",

    "profiles for voxels with `` normal '' ratios are drawn with the solid lines , while those for `` high '' [ ci]/@xmath1  ratios are shown with the dotted lines .",
    "it is clear that `` normal '' ratios generally correspond to brighter fluxes for both [ ci ]  and @xmath1 , as well as having the @xmath1  line flux about 50% stronger than the [ ci ]  flux ( i.e.  red @xmath60 green ) .",
    "profiles for `` high '' [ ci]/@xmath1  voxels , on the other hand , show weaker fluxes on average , as well as ( by design ) [ ci ]  fluxes that are ( slightly ) higher than @xmath1 .",
    "this result applies across all velocities , and in particular in each of the three principal spiral arm crossings along the g328 sightline .",
    "since the resulting profiles have been averaged across hundreds of voxels meeting the selection criteria their s / n is good .",
    "we can conclude that [ ci]/@xmath1  is higher in pixels where the [ ci ]  and @xmath1  line fluxes are lowest ; i.e.  as would occur preferentially on the edges of molecular clouds .",

    "however , as the @xmath0/@xmath1  line ratios shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiovsflux ] illustrate , their typical flux ratio is @xmath36 and virtually all voxels have [ @xmath0/@xmath1 ] @xmath65 ; i.e.  the @xmath0  remains strongly optically thick .",
    "when [ @xmath0/@xmath1 ] = 10 , for an isotope ratio [ @xmath66c/@xmath67c ] of 50 .",
    "] thus , this possibility ( low optical depth ) could only apply to relatively few voxels in the data set , at most .",

    "decreases _ going from `` normal '' to `` high '' [ ci]/@xmath1  values , by about @xmath69 .",
    "this indicates that there is slightly more atomic gas associated with the `` high '' [ ci]/@xmath1  ratio gas .",
    "also noticeable is the velocity range for the narrow , quiescent filament ( @xmath30 to @xmath35km / s ) discussed in paper i , where the [ ci]/hi  ratio is about 40% higher where [ ci]/@xmath1  is `` normal '' , indicating substantively more atomic gas associated with this filament than for other molecular gas .",
    "the conclusion is that high [ ci]/@xmath1  and @xmath0/@xmath1  ratios occur when the @xmath1  flux is weak ",
    "i.e.  on the edges of the various molecular emission features .",
    "at these same locations the @xmath0  emission is not , however , significantly weaker , on average .",
    "this can be attributed to optical depth ; the @xmath0  line remains optically thick , even when relatively less of the species is present , whereas the same sightline samples all of the @xmath1  in the gas , if it passes through the edges of clouds .",
    "since the @xmath1   flux is lower here then , as all the co is being sampled , its total column must also be lower . in these same sightlines",
    "we find that the [ ci ]  flux is only slightly lower , however , and hence so is the column of carbon .",
    "thus , elevated carbon to carbon monoxide column density ratios are measured towards the edges of all emission features , i.e.  at the edges of molecular clouds .",
    "furthermore , the lower [ ci]/hi  ratios in this same gas indicates that this material is associated with relatively more atomic gas at molecular cloud edges .",
    "this is as expected for sightlines passing preferentially through surface layers ( @xmath70 ) of pdrs , where co should be photodissociated into c and c@xmath6 and a significant amount of h@xmath7 is photodissociated into h.    thus , the relative column of c to co along these sightlines is increased in comparison to sightlines passing through the interiors of molecular clouds .",
    "this is also the observational signature we have defined for detecting `` dark gas '' .",
    "this amounts to a statistical detection of regions where the carbon ( c ) is enhanced in abundance compared to the carbon monoxide ( co ) .",
    "these must preferentially contain the surface regions of molecular clouds since they pass through their edges .",
    "finally , for the quiescent filament , which we hypothesized to be undergoing the process of molecular cloud formation in paper i , the increased hi  abundance associated with the cloud edges is consistent with the assertion that it is condensing out of the atomic substrate .",
    "we present here another technique to examine the significance of the increased [ ci]/@xmath1  ratios at the edges of the molecular clouds  hue  saturation plots .",
    "hue / saturation plots provide a way of visualizing two variables of interest , one of which provides some measure of `` importance '' , and the other its value .",
    "this is done by assigning the hue of a color to the value and the saturation ( or intensity ) of the color to the `` importance '' .",
    "hue is cyclic , representing the angle around a color wheel running through the spectrum from red to purple ( and back to red again ) ; i.e.  with range from @xmath71 up to @xmath72 .",

    "[ fig : co12co13vco13 ] ) , these values are consistent with the higher ratios being associated with sight lines passing through lower column density gas ( and/or just the front surfaces of pdrs ) .    to summarize , the line fluxes for @xmath0 , @xmath1  and [ ci ]  presented here for the g328 sightline of the galaxy are consistent with being produced in low density ( @xmath100@xmath101 ) photodissociation regions being excited by far ",
    "uv radiation fields with strengths around the typical average interstellar value ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "larger line ratios of [ ci]/@xmath1  are found , in general , associated with smaller values of the @xmath1  line flux .",
    "these smaller line fluxes are , in turn , generally associated with being emitted by gas with lower intrinsic line fluxes , rather than arising in sight lines with more beam dilution ( which is found to average around 50% ) .",
    "such regions are associated with the front surfaces of pdrs , within an optical extinction of 2 mags .  from the atomic hydrogen interface . here",
    "carbon can be found in ionized ( c@xmath6 ) , neutral ( c ) or molecular ( co ) form , rather than being dominated by co at greater depths .",
    "such regions are also associated with dark molecular gas , molecular clouds ( i.e.  h@xmath7 ) where co does not provide the dominant tracer for the gas .",
    "we have presented data cubes showing the distribution of the [ ci ]  21 , @xmath0 , @xmath1  and @xmath17  10 , and hi line emission , over a @xmath175 region of the galactic plane along a sightline towards g328 , with angular and spectral resolutions of @xmath176 and @xmath2  km / s .",
    "the [ ci ]  data comes from a new telescope , heat , sited on the summit of the antarctic plateau at the driest location on the earth , where the thz atmospheric windows are opened for observation .",
    "the co data was taken with the mopra telescope , and the hi data with the parkes and atca telescopes , all located in australia .",
    "complex morphology is evident in all species , with the [ ci ]  and co line emission extending over 120 km / s in extent , and arising principally from molecular cloud complexes in three spiral arm crossings along the sight line .",
    "the distribution in these atomic and molecular species is very similar in both angular and spectral dimensions , and is encompassed by more extensive hi line emission .",
    "however close examination of the [ ci ]  and co emission shows the latter to be slightly more extended spatially .",
    "average line ratios for @xmath0/[ci ] , @xmath1/[ci ]  and @xmath0/@xmath1  are found to @xmath48 , respectively , across all voxels in the data cubes when resampled to the same resolution .",
    "these ratios are relatively constant with velocity , across the three spiral arms crossed along the sight line . however , at the edges of the emission features the [ ci]/@xmath1  and @xmath0/@xmath1  ratios are typically found to be 50% larger , with [ ci]/hi  ratios around 10% lower .",
    "this is attributed to relatively more c than co at the edges of molecular clouds , with the @xmath1  intensity providing the best measure for the column of co , rather than the optically thick @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative amount of atomic gas is seen to rise at the edges of the clouds .",
    "pdr models were constructed for diffuse molecular gas exposed to average interstellar radiation fields to explore the behaviour of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , [ ci ]  10 and 21 , and [ cii ]  line emission with increasing extinction , @xmath80 , into molecular clouds from their front ( atomic ) surface .",
    "charge exchange reactions between c@xmath6 and both s and pahs were also found to be important to match the data , and require significant depletions of the s and pahs .",
    "the models then reproduce the broad behaviour seen in the data , in particular the line fluxes ( with average beam filling factors of @xmath4% ) and the increased line ratios for [ ci]/@xmath1  and @xmath0/@xmath1  in the surface layers , i.e.  when @xmath177mags .",
    "the highest values of the [ ci]/@xmath1  ratio measured require sightlines passing through clouds that have extinctions @xmath70 from their exciting sources .",
    "these may arise from sightlines that only pass through the edges of clouds , and/or small clouds whose total column density extends for @xmath166 .",
    "the @xmath1  and [ ci ]  lines remain marginally optically thin through the pdr , and so provide direct probes of the amount of co and c present , respectively .",
    "roughly one - third of the molecular gas along the sightline is estimated by these models to be associated with dark molecular gas , and about two - thirds in total when accounting for a spherical geometry .",
    "this is gas where co line emission does not provide a full tracer for the column of molecular gas that is present .",
    "considering the column of cold atomic gas in the front surface of the pdr , we also estimate that it contains @xmath8 of the total atomic gas along each sight line ( the rest being in atomic gas clouds ) . of the atomic gas within the pdr , @xmath161 of it",
    "is dark , i.e.  the fraction not measured through use of the standard optically thin assumption for determining column densities .",
    "this is only @xmath163 of the total atomic column along sight line , however .",
    "the modelling would also be aided by measurements of the [ ci ]  10 line emission at 492 ghz , whose ratio with the [ ci ]  21 line we have observed at 809ghz provides a probe that is sensitive to the gas temperature , predicted here to be @xmath178k for @xmath70 .",
    "such measurements could be made from the atacama plateau in chile , where the the superior angular resolution obtainable with larger telescopes such as nanten2 , apex and alma would allow for a better comparison of the relative distributions of the c and co , and so in determining more clearly the form and extent of the carbon envelope around molecular clouds .",
    "a full quantification of the amount of dark molecular present also requires measurement of the [ cii ]  line emission , which is confined within @xmath164 of the pdr surface .",
    "some airborne and space measurements currently for such [ cii ]  now exist .",
    "we provide predictions of its intensity and distribution with extinction into molecular clouds , to aid in their interpretation and for future observations made with thz facilities in antarctica , such as the sto2 long duration balloon - borne telescope scheduled for launch in 2016 and china s proposed 5 m date5 telescope for dome a on the summit of the antarctic plateau .",
