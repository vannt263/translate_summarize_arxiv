    "controversial fourth order differential equations , which govern the semiclassical cosmology can be reduced to second - order @xcite , @xcite , and in this way , exempted from quantum - originated instabilities @xcite @xcite .",
    "the reduction is based on the _ self - consistence _ condition , i.e. the assumption that both equations and solutions are perturbatively expandable in @xmath2 . under this condition",
    "the universe becomes an ordinary mechanical system with a two - dimensional phase - space corresponding to the single degree of mechanical freedom  the scale factor @xmath3 .",
    "self - consistent theory is still renormalizable @xcite , minkowski space - time regains stability in the class of homogeneous and isotropic models , quasi - inflationary phenomena disappear @xcite .",
    "similar reduction techniques are being applied to gravity with higher than fourth - order derivatives @xcite and also in other branches of physics @xcite .    however , imposing the self - consistence condition on the cosmological scale @xmath4 encounters some difficulties . in a universe with vanishing spatial curvature still remains a freedom to multiply metrics by an arbitrary constant factor , therefore the scale @xmath4 is not a measurable quantity .",
    "requirement for @xmath5 to be @xmath2-expandable is physically unclear . in open or closed universes this freedom",
    "is reduced by the choice @xmath6 , and the scale factors are uniquely determined by cosmological observables : the hubble parameter @xmath7 and the energy density @xmath8 . yet arbitrarily small changes in any of these observables in the vicinity of critical density @xmath9 may result in indefinite changes of @xmath4 .",
    "the perturbative character of the energy - momentum tensor ( and consequently the equations ) with respect to an arbitrary chosen parameter , in general , does not imply the same property of the metrics . finally , expanding @xmath4 in the equations , which contain fixed curvature index @xmath10 @xcite , limits quantum corrections to only those , which preserve the same sign of the space curvature .",
    "this limitation is particularly severe for a flat universe , where generic quantum corrections would contribute to the space curvature unless the @xmath11 condition prevents that .",
    "this limitation can not be derived directly from the lagrangian and , in fact , it forms an additional constraint imposed on the theory ( which is not even true in classical gravity diverges from zero . ] ) .    not arguing with the very idea of self - consistence , we draw attention to some circumstances which are important for semiclassical cosmology :    \\1 . without harm to the reduction procedure",
    ", one can release the consistence condition for the scale factor , demanding instead the same property for cosmological observables ( the hubble parameter , etc . )",
    "\\2 . for a radiation filled universe with vanishing cosmological constant @xmath12",
    "the self - consistence condition is superfluous , since the original equation is of second ( ! ) order .",
    "terms with higher derivatives cited by classical papers @xcite contain an additional hidden factor @xmath2 and are eventually eliminated in the first order expansion .",
    "we show that quantum corrections form the equation of state of a barotropic fluid , and discuss the stability of the minkowski space - time on the ground of dynamic systems theory .",
    "we consider semiclassical gravity theory with the lagrangian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 represents classical radiation or another thermalized field of massless particles .",
    "typically , cosmologies containing the @xmath13 and the @xmath14 terms lead to 4 order equations @xcite and violate the stability of empty space@xcite .",
    "we write quantum terms on the right - hand side of the field equations and treat them as corrections to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we think of @xmath2 as the theory parameter , which can take arbitrary values , so the limit transition @xmath15 defines the classical limit of the theory .",
    "the field equations we write in the einsteinian form @xmath16 , but with the modified , effective energy - momentum tensor    @xmath17    where    @xmath18    and the constant @xmath19 is some combination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( robertson - walker symmetry have been partially exploited to derive formula ( [ tef ] ) . for more precise explanation see @xcite . )",
    "derived in this way the ( 0,0)-equation    @xmath22\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac { \\alpha_1\\hbar}{a^4}\\left[-18k^2 + 36k\\left(\\frac { da}{dt}\\right)^2 + 54\\left(\\frac { da}{dt}\\right)^4 - 36a\\left(\\frac { da}{dt}\\right)^2\\frac { d^2a}{dt^2 } + 18a^2\\left(\\frac { d^2a}{dt^2}\\right)^2 - 36a^2\\frac { da}{dt}\\frac { da^3}{dt^3}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac { \\alpha_3\\hbar}{a^4}\\left[3\\left(\\frac { da}{dt}\\right)^4 + 6k\\left(\\frac { da}{dt}\\right)^2 + 3k^2\\right]\\label{a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    contains four fundamental constants , two of them classical - the gravitation constant @xmath23 ( further on we put @xmath24 ) , the cosmological constant @xmath25 , and two quantum ones - @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "there are also two quantities which define a particular solution : the constant of motion @xmath26 , and the index of space curvature @xmath10",
    ". therefore , the transition from classical to quantum theory with the self - consistence @xmath27 imposed on ( [ a1 ] ) preserves the type of space curvature , including the strong @xmath11 limitation for the flat universe .",
    "one can get rid of the last two constants , and consequently , of the constraints they bring , by introducing the hubble expansion parameter @xmath28 . differentiating ( [ a1 ] ) twice",
    ", we obtain the fourth order equation for @xmath7 , which contains only fundamental constants ) formally has a broader class of solutions than ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "however , the freedom to choose @xmath10 as different from @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a trivial one , and resolves itself to rescaling the metrics by a constant factor . ]",
    "@xmath31\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 4h\\left[162\\hbar\\alpha_1\\left(\\frac { dh}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\frac { dh}{dt}\\left(3\\left(48\\hbar\\alpha_1-\\hbar\\alpha_3\\right)h^2 -2\\lambda\\left(6\\hbar\\alpha_1+\\hbar\\alpha_3\\right)\\right ) -3\\hbar\\alpha_3h^4\\right].\\label{4h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this equation describes the dynamics of robertson - walker models with arbitrary space curvature , and what is equally important , it is expressed in terms of observable quantities . a self - consistence condition imposed on measurable quantities",
    "has well defined physical meaning .",
    "we adopt simon s ansatz to @xmath7 , namely we state that @xmath32 is perturbative in @xmath2 .",
    "now , the procedure of the order reduction can be done in two ways : + 1 ) one can differentiate twice the zeroth - order expansion ( equation ( [ 4h ] ) with @xmath33 ) to find the third and fourth derivatives and eliminate them from the full equation ( [ 4h ] ) - this is equivalent to what is done in @xcite , + 2 ) substitute the expansion @xmath34 directly into ( [ 4h ] ) and abandon terms second order in @xmath2 or higher .",
    "+ in both cases we obtain the second order equation    @xmath35\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 4 h\\left[459\\hbar\\alpha_1\\left(\\frac { dh}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\frac { dh}{dt}\\left(3\\left(372\\hbar\\alpha_1-\\hbar\\alpha_3\\right)h^2 -2\\lambda\\left(69\\hbar\\alpha_1+\\hbar\\alpha_3\\right)\\right)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 4\\left(3\\left(180\\hbar\\alpha_1-\\hbar\\alpha_3\\right)h^4 -204\\lambda\\hbar\\alpha_1h^2 + 8\\lambda^2\\hbar\\alpha_1\\right),\\label{2h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is nonlinear both in @xmath7 and its derivatives .",
    "so strong nonlinearity allows one to find exact solutions only in some particular situations .",
    "the is not the case in equation ( [ 2h ] ) .",
    "however , this equation becomes much more transparent after one rewrites the quantum corrections as contributions to energy density and pressure .",
    "qualitative analysis is then enabled .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath36 denote respectively effective energy density and effective pressure , i.e. each of these quantities is supplemented by quantum corrections .",
    "the universe dynamics is determined by the system of the raychaudhuri ( [ ray ] ) and the continuity ( [ kont ] ) equations    @xmath37    we differentiate ( [ ray ] ) , substitute into ( [ 2h ] ) and apply the continuity equation ( [ kont ] ) to get the relation between pressure , energy and the cosmological constant in differential form    @xmath38    as a matter of fact , one can solve equation ( [ diffstate ] ) analytically , however the solution takes unclear implicit form .",
    "this is much simpler to follow the other way .",
    "the solution of ( [ diffstate ] ) must be a function of the energy density and cosmological constant solely , hence @xmath39 is independent of the expansion rate @xmath7 .",
    "therefore the limit transition @xmath40 does not affect its values , and the general solution is identical with the integral found for the flat universe .",
    "in the last case the equation    @xmath41 + \\hbar\\alpha_1\\frac { d^3h}{dt^3}+7\\hbar\\alpha_1h\\frac { d^2h}{dt^2 } + \\frac { \\hbar}3\\left[12\\alpha_1\\left[\\frac { dh}{dt}\\right]^2 + \\left(36\\alpha_1-\\alpha_3\\right)h^2\\frac { dh}{dt}-\\alpha_3h^4\\right]=0\\ ] ]    is an analogue to equation ( [ 4h ] ) .",
    "its order reduces by two , and finally the equation takes a particularly simple form    @xmath42    now , comparing ( [ redflat ] ) with the raychaudhuri equation ( [ ray ] ) we obtain the equation of state of cosmological substratum in the form of the algebraic relation    @xmath43    function @xmath39 , defined by ( [ algestate ] ) , fulfills the differential equation([diffstate ] ) with an accuracy to terms @xmath44 . by simple calculation",
    "@xcite , one can confirm that the exact solutions found by parker and simon also obey ( [ algestate ] ) .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the equation of state ( [ algestate ] ) is barotropic , i.e. effective pressure is solely the function of the effective energy density ( including the energy of vacuum @xmath25 ) .",
    "while reducing the equations order we eliminate contributions to the energy - momentum tensor coming from the expansion rate @xcite ; therefore the universe evolution becomes a reversible process ( equations ( [ ray])-([kont ] ) are invariant under the time reflection @xmath45 ) .",
    "quantum corrections contained in ( [ algestate ] ) , and consequently the dynamical system ( [ ray]-[kont ] ) are free of the @xmath20 constant .",
    "the only term multiplied by @xmath20 which survives the reduction procedure @xcite , has been assimilated here by the effective energy density .",
    "its worth noticing that in some physically interesting situations the reduction procedure eliminating higher order derivatives is redundant . in the radiation filled universe with",
    "null cosmological constant the correction @xmath46 , which formally appears as linear in @xmath2 , actually is quadratic , and consequently should be abandoned as the @xmath47 term . to show this",
    "let us express the traceless tensor @xmath48 in terms of the ricci scalar and the effective energy density    @xmath49\\ ] ]    the field equations with the energy - momentum tensor ( [ tef ] ) show that the scalar @xmath50 involves the trace of the tensor @xmath51 , namely @xmath52 , so it is a quantity linearly dependent on @xmath2 .",
    "writing @xmath53 in terms of the effective energy density @xmath8 with the accuracy to terms @xmath47 we get @xmath54",
    ". tensors @xmath48 and @xmath51 can be rewritten as    @xmath55\\ ] ] @xmath56-\\frac 8{27}\\alpha_3\\hbar\\epsilon^3\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc } 0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&1&0&0\\\\ 0&0&1&0\\\\ 0&0&0&1\\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ]    now it is clear that only the second of the expressions @xmath57 and @xmath58 is essentially linear in @xmath2 and forms the first - order quantum contribution to the energy - momentum tensor . the first one @xmath57 , which carries all higher derivatives is actually square in @xmath2 .",
    "this is closely related to the absence of particle creation in the radiation - filled robertson - walker universe ( see @xcite and papers cited there . ) the theory with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath59 leads to the effective equation of state @xmath60 , which is perfectly consistent with ( [ algestate ] ) .",
    "the equation of state of the form @xmath61 ( or more generally @xmath62 see @xcite ) uniquely determines cosmological evolution .",
    "the system ( [ ray]-[kont ] ) , which defines the universe dynamics in the @xmath63-phase space is autonomous .",
    "choosing a point in the @xmath63-phase space , one determines uniquely the metrics in the initial moment as well as the metrics evolution in time .",
    "the stability of the minkowski space - time is defined by the stability of the @xmath64 point in the @xmath63-phase space under the condition @xmath12 . for the equation of state ( [ algestate ] ) discussed in the preceding section the autonomous system ( [ ray]-[kont ] )",
    "reads :    @xmath65 \\label{hdot}\\\\ \\frac { d\\epsilon}{dt}&=&-4h\\left[\\epsilon -\\frac 13\\alpha_3\\hbar\\epsilon^2\\right ] \\label{edot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and its trajectories form levels of the integral    @xmath66    the phase portrait of the system ( [ hdot]-[edot ] ) is shown on fig .",
    "1 . for completeness and also for readers convenience , we attach fig .",
    "2 . showing classical friedmanian dynamics in the same representation .",
    "the phase structure of classical radiation - filled universes and the phase structure defined by ( [ hdot]-[edot ] ) are topologically equivalent in the low energy limit .",
    "this is so because one can not enrich the structure of the @xmath67-phase plane without violating the standard energy conditions . on the other hand , according to ( [ algestate ] ) these conditions are well fulfilled for low and positive energy densities .",
    "the equation of state ( [ algestate ] ) formally admits violation of the energy conditions but these states appears already in the planckian regime and hence , far beyond the region where semiclassical approximation is valid .",
    "( the dotted region in the upper part of fig .",
    "1 , which contains three additional critical points must be recognized as nonphysical ) .",
    "an essential property of the system ( [ hdot]-[edot ] ) is the absence of solutions that change the energy density from positive to negative , or the reverse .",
    "( such behaviour was possible in the original semiclassical theory and disqualified the empty space as a ground state . ) indeed , on the strength of ( [ algestate ] ) , the initial condition @xmath68 results in @xmath69 , and consequently the right - hand side of equation ( [ edot ] ) vanishes . both conditions @xmath70 and @xmath71 ensure that the state of the zero energy density is persistent. this is consistent with the results based on the functional integral formalism @xcite , where all higher derivative terms responsible for instability are eliminated by regularisation of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the stability of minkowski space - time is the same as in the classical theory . in both cases , the classical or the quantum ,",
    "the @xmath72 point is a three - fold point with elliptical sector @xcite and its type does not depend on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "this means that the phase space is structuraly stable against quantum corrections in the low energy density limit .",
    "this nontrivial property does not follow from the solutions analicity in @xmath2 , but from the form of the energy density tensor ( [ tef ] ) .",
    ", though the critical point corresponding to empty space bifurcates into three simple points .",
    "two of them represent de sitter space time , the third one  the einstein static universe @xcite .",
    "however , no bifurcation , results from quantum corrections . ]",
    "in the reduced simon - parker theory the energy - momentum tensor is renormalized to take the hydrodynamic form with a simple , barotropic equation of state .",
    "the self - consistence conditions for semiclassical cosmology can be imposed on observable quantities and weakened . by demanding the hubble expansion rate to be perturbative in @xmath2",
    "we allow the space curvature to alter from 0 while quantum corrections to the flat universes occur .    in the particular case of the radiation - filled universe and vanishing cosmological constant",
    ", the dynamics of the robertson - walker universe in the ( original ) semiclassical theory is described by a second order equation , therefore it does not need either the reduction or additional conditions of self - consistence .",
    "the reason lies in the absence of particle creation in the radiation filled universe , which manifests itself as an additional factor @xmath2 hidden  in the tensor @xmath73 .",
    "this eventually eliminates all the higher derivative terms .",
    "minkowski space - time has the same stability character as for einsteinian gravity , which is consistent with results based on the functional integral formalism @xcite .",
    "the stability of minkowski space - time is independent of the numerical value of the planck constant . in the language of dynamical systems theory , this property",
    "is called the structural stability of the @xmath74-phase space against changes of @xmath2 .    its worth noticing that the liapunov stability of the environment with equation of state ( [ algestate ] ) with respect to position - dependent perturbations is also the same as for the classical radiation - filled universe@xcite , in contrast to the original semiclassical theory , where quantum corrections let inhomogeneities grow .",
    "this suggests an insignificant role for semiclassical corrections in the processes of structure formation in the early universe .",
