    "plastic deformation of metallic bodies is caused by the creation and movement of dislocations in the crystal lattice of the metallic material .",

    "standard phenomenological models for viscoplastic material behavior do not reflect these material properties depending on the microstructure of the material .",
    "a modelling approach taking this microstructure into account is the continuous theory of dislocations , which was developed several decades ago and which is well understood in continuum mechanics . under many articles in this field",

    "we are convinced that the mathematical aspects deserve much more investigation and that the theory can be advanced and simulations based on the theory can be improved by such investigations .",
    "we begin by stating the standard model for the deformation of a viscoplastic body consisting of a metallic material with dislocations moving only in one slip plane of the crystal structure .",
    "it consists of the equations @xmath0 which must hold for time @xmath1 and for @xmath2 varying in the open set @xmath3 representing the material points of the body .",

    "the elasticity tensor @xmath16 is a linear , symmetric , positive definite mapping and the constant matrix @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the unit vector normal to the slip plane , and @xmath20 is a unit vector in the direction of plastic slip ; it is therefore a vector in the slip plane . for vectors",

    "the constitutive equation is an ordinary differential equation in time and does not reflect material behavior caused by the dislocation microstructure .",
    "the field equations of the continuous theory of dislocations do reflect this microstructure . to derive these field equations we start in section  [ s2 ] by discussing the volterra model for dislocation curves in linear elasticity and by defining the space of dislocation measures . the evolution equation for dislocation measures",

    "[ s3.3 ] we discuss the restrictions on the model equations following from the incompressibility constraint for the plastic part of the strain tensor and we obtain the final field equations .",

    "we finally consider the situation , where every dislocation curve is contained in a plane and moves within this plane .",
    "different dislocation curves can be contained in the same plane or in parallel planes .",
