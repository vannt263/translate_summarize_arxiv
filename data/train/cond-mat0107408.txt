    "transport and thermodynamic properties of mesoscopic metallic samples are known for a long time to be quite sensitive to the quantum phase coherence of the electronic wave functions at low temperature @xcite . in particular",
    ", it was shown that a mesoscopic ring threaded by a magnetic field exhibits a persistent current periodic with the flux and with a period of one flux quantum @xmath5 .",
    "this current was measured in several experiments @xcite @xcite @xcite , corresponding to different situations and materials .",
    "more recently , the response of a mesoscopic system to a time dependent magnetic field was studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate how screening is influenced by electronic interferences in a phase coherent sample . in this spirit , we discuss how the electrical polarisability @xmath6 , i.e. the response of a metallic sample to an electrostatic field , a quantity which is directly related to screening , is also sensitive to mesoscopic effects .",
    "@xmath6 can be experimentally measured by coupling the mesoscopic samples to a capacitor . for small voltages ,",
    "corresponding to the linear regime , the change in the capacitance is directly proportional to the average polarisability @xmath7 of the particles .",
    "when the typical size @xmath8 of the particle is much larger than the thomas fermi screening length @xmath9 , @xmath6 is mostly determined by the geometrical shape of the particle . for a spherical particle ,",
    "it is proportional to the volume @xmath10 of the particle , with a small correction of the order of @xmath11 .",
    "now , what happens in the case of a quantum coherent sample , ( i.e when @xmath8 is the order of the phase coherence length )",
    "? is there a _ mesoscopic correction _ to the polarisability , due to contribution from electronic interferences ?    in order to answer this question , we have calculated the flux dependent correction to the average polarisability , which we call `` mesoscopic correction '' , for _ two dimensional mesoscopic samples _ in the presence of an _ aharonov - bohm flux_. two different geometries have been considered , namely a two dimensional ring or square in an in - plane electric field .",
    "the role of statistical ensemble , disorder , and finite frequency have been investigated . in the case of a time dependent electric field ,",
    "we distinguish two different limits , whether the frequency is smaller or larger than the inverse relaxation time , or mean level broadening @xmath12 .",
    "the case @xmath13 corresponds to the thermodynamic limit whereas @xmath14 corresponds to the finite frequency limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the definition of the electrical polarisability and the classical result for a macroscopic sample are given in section [ basics ] .",
    "in section [ pol_no_screening ] , we derive the expression of the electrical polarisability of a system of non - interacting electrons , in the spirit of the early work of gorkov and eliashberg ( ge ) @xcite .",
    "a giant unphysical polarisability is obtained .",
    "however it is possible to discuss in this very simple model the flux dependence of two quantities which contribute to the polarisability , namely the matrix element of the position ( or screened potential ) operator and the contribution of energy levels .",
    "then , we examine in section [ screening ] how screening can be taken into account . in particular , we show how to incorporate contributions of electronic interferences . using those results , a general expression for the polarisability and its mesoscopic correction for a time varying electric field",
    "are derived in section [ expressions ] .",
    "we study then separately the case of the grand canonical and canonical statistical ensemble .",
    "the grand canonical average polarisability is found to depend only on the flux dependent matrix elements of the screened potential whereas the canonical average depends also on the energy levels . as a result when the frequency is smaller than the level spacing the magneto - polarisability is found much smaller in the canonical ensemble compared to the grand canonical case .",
    "finally , we present results on the hartree - fock correction to the zero frequency polarisability .",
    "section vi is devoted to a comparison of these results with recent experiments .",
    "when an external field @xmath15 is applied on a conductor , the charge density adjusts in such a way that the effective field inside the conductor cancels . this phenomenon is called screening . in principle",
    "the computation of the potential inside the sample requires to solve a complex n body hamiltonian taking into account the long range coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "however it is possible in general to treat the interactions in a mean field approximation .",
    "the screened potential inside the conductor is then given by :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the charge density induced at the point @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the coulomb interaction potential . in the linear response limit",

    "the problem is more complex in a disordered system , which does not have the translational invariance . in any case for a finite system",
    ", it is possible to compute the response function from the eigenstates @xmath29 of the system in the absence of the external field , associated to the eigenvalues @xmath30 : @xmath31 in most cases we will identify these eigenstates as the solution of the hamiltonian of the system without electron interactions which will be taken into account only by considering the screening on the applied field .",
    "the effect of interactions on the eigenstates will be however discussed in section vii within the hartree fock approximation .    the application of an electric field on a finite metallic system , results in an induced dipolar moment @xmath32 which , for a sufficiently small field , is proportional to the applied field .",
    "@xmath33    where @xmath6 is by definition the polarisability of the conductor , which can be expressed as a function of the response function :    @xmath34        the polarisability of a macroscopic piece of metal is described by classical electrostatics . in this approximation , the dipolar moment can be calculated by solving poisson equation , @xmath35 , in all space and imposing as well that the conductor is at a constant potential .",
    "the problem is solvable analytically for a sphere of volume @xmath10 : @xmath36 .",
    "it is also possible to estimate the polarisability of a metallic plate of thickness @xmath37 in a constant electric field perpendicular to the plate .",

    "the effective electric field inside the strip is imposed to be zero . in the limit of an infinite strip",
    ", this condition leads to the following equation :    @xmath41    we have calculated numerically the solution of [ equastrip ] in the case of an infinite strip ( fig .",
    "[ fruban ] ) .",
    "in contrast with the 3 dimensional case , the charge distribution spreads over the full width of the strip in order to cancel the external field .",
    "the numerical solution is very close to a logarithm . assuming that the density is of the form @xmath42 , the integral [ defmdip ] of the previous function gives @xmath43 .",
    "this result extrapolates to a 2 dimensional sample of typical size @xmath3 , for which the in - plane polarisability scales like @xmath44 .",
    "for instance the polarisability of a disk of radius @xmath45 is @xmath46 @xcite .    in the case of a one dimensional wire ,",
    "whose length l is much longer than its diameter d , in an electric field along its axis , the polarisability has been shown to be @xmath47@xcite .",
    "similarly as in the @xmath48 case , the charge density has to spread over the entire wire in order to screen the external potential .",
    "the case of a 1d ring is also exactly solvable . in order to take screening into account",
    ", we first assume that the induced charge density in the ring is of the form @xmath49 , from which we deduce the induced potential in the ring :    @xmath50    the integral is logarythmically diverging and it is necessary to introduce a cutoff @xmath51 , related to the finite width w of the ring : @xmath52 .",
    "the screened potential reads @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",
    "the polarisability is obtained either from the potential calculated above , either from the expression of the charge .",
    "this self - consistent relation sets the value of the parameter @xmath2 , from which we deduce the polarisability of the ring .    @xmath55    where @xmath56 which reads in the limit @xmath57 :    @xmath58    as a result both longitudinal polarisabilities of a ring and a disk scale like the cube of their radius , just like the polarisability of a sphere .      in the following ,",
    "we define the quantity we wish to calculate .",
    "as we have just seen , the classical polarisability of a metallic sample is determined by geometrical factors . however , due to the pauli principle , charges can not strictly accumulate on the border of the sample , but the charge density distribution rather extends on the screening length @xmath9 .",
    "this effect reduces the polarisability compared to its classical value by a quantity @xmath59 of the order of @xmath11 , where @xmath8 is the typical size of the conductor along the electric field . in a coherent sample , electronic interferences",
    "might also give rise to a contribution @xmath60 to the polarisability .",
    "the total polarisability can thus be written : @xmath61 . in order to show evidence of this correction",
    ", a magnetic flux can be applied through the sample in order to introduce a flux dependent part in the phase difference of electronic trajectories .",
    "we will call `` mesoscopic correction '' the flux dependent part of the polarisability @xmath62 .",
    "we will focus on the ensemble average of this quantity @xmath63 , which is @xmath64 periodic .",
    "we will characterize the flux dependence of @xmath65 by @xmath66 .",
    "part of the analysis we have done rely on computer simulations .",
    "the two dimensional rings or squares are modelled by the anderson model .",
    "each atomic site is coupled to its nearest neighbour by a hopping term @xmath67 .",
    "disorder is introduced by on - site energies randomly distributed in the interval @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the anderson hamiltonian can be written in second quantization :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the creation operator associated with site @xmath71 .",
    "the magnetic flux is introduced in this hamiltonian through the phase factor of the hoping element with @xmath72 for a ring of size @xmath8 . in the case of squares",
    "we have taken into account the penetration of the magnetic field in the sample : the phase factor appearing in the hopping matrix elements is computed from the integral of the potential vector between concerned neighbors . in two dimensions , an estimation of the elastic mean free path is given by @xmath73 @xcite allowing us to choose values of @xmath74 so that the system is in the diffusive regime . in order",
    "to average quantities we take advantage of ergodicity properties in the diffusive regime and average over the number of electrons in the system between one quarter and three quarter filling .",
    "we now examine the electrical response of a quantum system of non - interacting electrons , which was first calculated by ge @xcite for a metallic grain both in the diffusive and ballistic limit .",
    "their conclusion is quite surprising : in the diffusive regime , @xmath6 is bigger than the classical polarisability by a factor @xmath75 , where @xmath37 is the typical size of the grain and @xmath76 is the bohr radius .",
    "later on , rice @xcite stressed the lack of screening in the calculation of ge and showed that when screening is taken into account , one recovers the classical polarisability .",
    "we will see in the following that it is useful to consider the flux dependence of the polarisability within this crude approximation , since many results remain qualitatively true in the presence of screening .",
    "the polarisability of a system of non - interacting electrons can be understood as the sensitivity of the energy spectrum to an external electric field , just like persistent currents measure the sensitivity of the spectrum to an aharonov - bohm flux . as a matter of fact",
    ", the eigenstates @xmath29 of the system and the eigenvalues @xmath30 , are modified by an external electric field @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78    @xmath79    consequently , it exists an induced charge density @xmath80 , associated with the asymmetry of each wave function generated by @xmath77 . using the definition [ defmdip ] of @xmath6 , the expression of the polarisability of a system of non - interacting electrons at zero temperature can be found :    @xmath81    this expression depends on the eigen - energies of the unperturbed system and its eigen - functions through the matrix elements of the position operator . due to the energy denominator",
    ", the polarisability will in particular be very sensitive to the electric field induced coupling between the last occupied levels and the first non occupied ones .",
    "note also that this expression of the polarisability is also from expression [ eqener ] identical to the second derivative of the total energy of the system with respect to electric field .",
    "@xmath82 these results present strong similarities with the paramagnetic contribution of orbital susceptibility of a mesoscopic ring pierced by a flux line which is identical to expression [ polsansint ] where the @xmath83 is replaced by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the potential vector and @xmath32 is the kinetic momentum operator .",
    "the total magnetic susceptibility contains also a constant diamagnetic term @xmath86 @xcite,@xcite which does not exist in the electric response .      using expression [ polsansint ]",
    "it is possible to calculate exactly the induced dipolar moment in a 1d non - disordered ring in an in plane electric field .",
    "wavefunctions only depend on the angle @xmath87 , indicating the position in the ring , and satisfy the 1d shrdinger equation : @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic flux , associated with the periodicity in the ring , imposes the following boundary condition @xmath89 .",
    "this equation can be solved . using the parity and periodicity of the spectrum",
    ", we then order the eigenvalues and the corresponding wavefunctions in ascending order in the interval @xmath90 $ ] :    @xmath91    as a consequence of the particular geometry of the system , the electric field only couples certain states .",
    "in particular , the matrix element between adjacent states cancels unless the quantum numbers @xmath92 et @xmath93 are such that @xmath94 , in this case : @xmath95 the polarisability depends on the parity of the number of electrons @xmath96 and reads :    @xmath97    at zero flux and for @xmath98 : @xmath99 .",
    "it is possible to evaluate @xmath100 by computing @xmath101 . as a result :    @xmath102    it is a very small effect , since it decreases rapidly with the number of electrons in the ring .",
    "this result remains true for a multichannel ring .",
    "we attribute this effect to selection rules inherent to the square lattice which are responsible for the cancellation of the matrix elements of operator x between eigenstates close to a level crossing .",
    "in particular it has been shown @xcite that these selection rules do not exist in the hexagonal lattice where giant magnetopolarisability is expected for particular values of flux at the same level of approximation .    in order to investigate the effect of disorder",
    "we have performed numerical simulations using the anderson model . on figure [ p100 ]",
    "is plotted the magnetopolarisability for a ring of length @xmath103 and several values of the disorder @xmath104 . in absence of disorder ,",
    "the results are in qualitative agreement with formula [ dpol1d ] .",
    "the effect then decreases when the disorder is increased , with a law close to @xmath105 .",
    "one is tempted to attribute this result to occurrence of localization in the 1d ring .",
    "however we will see in the following that this cancellation of the flux dependent polarisability is also observed in a multichannel ring or disk in the diffusive regime .",
    "in the following we discuss a diffusive system characterized by a diffusion coefficient @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the elastic mean free path which is assumed to be shorter than the system size @xmath37 along the electric field .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , @xcite , @xcite using semiclassical arguments that the average square matrix element , @xmath108 depends mainly of the energy difference @xmath109 and the thouless energy @xmath110 .",
    "for @xmath111 it is of the order of @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the ratio between the thouless energy and the mean level spacing @xmath114 . at higher energy it decreases like @xmath115 .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig.[xener ] showing numerical results on a sample for different values of disorder where these two regimes can be clearly distinguished .",
    "it is then easy to deduce the order of magnitude of the polarisability noting that the summation in expression [ polsansint ] can be restricted to @xmath116 as a result :    @xmath117    the ge result is then recovered assuming that the fermi wave length is of the order of the bohr radius .",
    "we will see in the next section that this result is modified by screening .",
    "it is however worth continuing this analysis in this oversimplified picture of non interacting electrons in the case of an aharonov - bohm ring . from expression [ polsansint ]",
    "the polarisability is expected to exhibit flux dependence both from the matrix elements and energy denominators .",
    "we discuss in the following separately these two contributions which is justified in the context of random matrix theory where eigenfunctions and eigenenergies constitute two sets of independent random variables @xcite .",
    "we focus on the flux dependence of the quantity @xmath118 .",
    "this quantity depends only on the energy differences @xmath119 , and can be expressed as a function of @xmath120 , the two levels correlation function : @xmath121    in the diffusive regime , @xmath122 is well described by random matrix theory @xcite and the average probability to find two degenerate adjacent levels is zero .",
    "this property is characteristic of level repulsion in the spectrum of a random matrix , which is stronger in a system where reversal symmetry is broken compared to a system where it is not . as a consequence , @xmath123 decreases as a function of the flux at low magnetic flux and increases back in the vicinity of @xmath124 where time reversal symmetry is recovered .",
    "we have calculated numerically @xmath123 in a disordered ring of length @xmath125 and width @xmath126 for several value of the on - site disorder @xmath104 corresponding to the diffusive regime .",
    "figure [ denom ] illustrate the effect described above . in the absence of other contributions ,",
    "this term would give rise to a negative magnetopolarisability .",
    "on figure [ xdnd ] are plotted the flux dependance of the average square of the diagonal and non - diagonal matrix elements for a diffusive ring .",
    "it can be noted that they have opposite flux dependences , resulting from the fact that @xmath127 is flux independent .",
    "the diagonal elements decrease as a function of the flux , whereas the non - diagonal elements increases .",
    "the time reversal property of the operator @xmath128 implies that its diagonal matrix elements are real even function of flux and can be developed in successive powers of @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath130 is maximum for multiple values of @xmath124 .",
    "it is possible to evaluate analytically this flux dependence of the diagonal matrix elements from random matrix theory , using the relation between @xmath131 and the sensitivity of the energies to an electric field : @xmath132 . since electric field preserves time - reversal symmetry , the typical value of the derivative of the energy levels with respect to the electric field @xmath133 is proportional to @xmath134 .",
    "consequently : @xmath135 .",
    "figure [ xdnd ] shows that this last result is qualitatively true .",
    "therefore , in absence of the energy denominator @xmath136 , the flux dependence of the matrix elements would give rise to a positive magnetopolarisability .",
    "as a result this flux dependence is opposite to the contribution of the energy denominators .",
    "moreover we can see on fig .",
    "[ polacgc ] that these contributions almost exactly cancel and there is no magneto - polarisability in this model .",
    "we will see however in section v that a non zero magnetopolarisability is found at finite frequency in the grand canonical ensemble or at finite temperature in the canonical ensemble where the energy denominators contribution disappears . at this stage",
    "it is interesting to emphasize that the flux dependence of the average square of the x operator matrix element is opposite to the same quantity related to the current operator which changes sign by time reversal symmetry .",
    "so when computing the magnetic susceptibility the contribution of the matrix elements and energy denominators are of the same sign .",
    "this effect is related to the existence of a finite average current in the canonical ensemble for a diffusive ring .",
    "note that both persistent current and zero frequency polarisability can be expressed as a function of the free energy of the system : @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "so : @xmath139    let us emphasize that the absence of thermodynamic magnetopolarisability thus related to the insensitivity of persistent currents to an electrostatic field and can be qualitatively understood using a semi - classical argument .",
    "the effect of the electrostatic potential slowly varying at the scale of the fermi wavelength can be included into the phase of the electronic wavefunctions .",
    "persistent currents can be computed from the integral of the classical action on a circular orbit .",
    "the contribution of the static electrostatic potential on such an orbit : @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 obviously cancels out .",
    "this argument is helpful to understand why the polarisability is independent of the flux in this very low frequency regime .",
    "as mentioned above the mean field approximation reduces the complicated many body problem of interacting electrons to a much simpler one , in which electrons move in an effective potential @xmath143 , resulting from the screening of the applied potential by other electrons .",
    "therefore , it goes beyond a simple electrostatic calculation by taking into account the kinetic energy of electrons as well as their fermionic character @xcite .    in the linear regime ,",
    "i.e for a small external potential , the induced charge density is simply proportional to the effective potential @xcite , @xcite : @xmath144 at 3d with @xmath145 and @xmath146 for a conducting plane at z=0 with @xmath147 .",
    "the resolution of the self - consistent equation [ relself ] within this thomas fermi approximation for a 3d sample in the presence of a uniform external applied field , gives rise to a screened potential whose value is of the order of @xmath148 which is confined to the border of the sample within @xmath149 .",
    "this result is in principle not true any more in a 2d system where classical screening already involves charge displacement in the whole system .",
    "however since the charge distribution is always singular on the edge of the sample it is possible to approximate the screened potential for a disk of radius r by : @xmath150 where f is a peaked function centered on zero of width @xmath151 . when screening is taken into account the expression of the quantum polarisability at t=0 reads : @xmath152 within this approximation the ge result for the polarisability is modified by a factor @xmath153 and becomes identical to the classical result .",
    "as we have seen , the thomas - fermi approximation does not take into account contribution of the screening due to electronic interferences .",
    "they indeed give rise to a quantum correction for the response function @xmath154 , and consequently to the effective potential @xmath26 and the polarisability @xmath6 :    @xmath155    where @xmath154 is the response to the local field .",
    "assuming that those corrections are small compared to the thomas - fermi value , it is possible to show , in agreement with efetov @xcite ( see appendix [ calculefetov ] for the detailed calculation ) , that @xmath156 can be simply expressed as a function of the mesoscopic correction to the one electron response function @xmath157 and the thomas - fermi potential : @xmath158 in the following we discuss the response to a time dependent electric field .",
    "we will see that dynamical polarisability can be very different from the static one .",
    "the application of a time - dependent external potential @xmath159 raises the problem of the relaxation of the system towards equilibrium .",
    "this process is made by inelastic processes characterized by a typical time scale , related to inelastic collisions .    in the limit of a weak coupling",
    ", this process can be described by a master equation on the density matrix @xcite :    @xmath160-i\\gamma\\left(\\rho-\\rho_{eq}\\right)\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath161 represents the broadening of the energy levels and characterizes dissipation processes , allowing the relaxation of the system towards equilibrium .",

    "two limits are to be considered .",
    "when the frequency of the time dependent potential is small compared to @xmath161 ; the system follows the potential and stays at every moment at equilibrium . on the contrary , at high frequency",
    "compared to @xmath161 , the system is always out of equilibrium .    in addition , we assume that the effective potential is always in phase with the external one .",
    "this is justified if the dissipative part of the polarisability is very small compared to the non - dissipative part ( @xmath166 , this last quantity being discussed in @xcite .",

    ", we deduce the response function and later on the polarisability and its quantum correction @xmath167 , which can be expressed as a function of the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath168 .    @xmath169    @xmath170      in this section , we examine the differences between the canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "the canonical ensemble corresponds to the situation for which the number of electrons in the system is fixed .",
    "it is in particular the case for electrically isolated systems .",

    ", the system can exchange electrons with the thermodynamic reservoir , which imposes the value of the chemical potential . a physical realization",
    "consists in connecting the ring to a large metallic pad . at finite temperature ,",
    "the occupation of the energy levels is spread over an energy interval of the order of the temperature . as a result",
    ", the sensitivity to the flux dependence of the chemical potential is suppressed when @xmath172 , where @xmath114 is the mean level spacing .",
    "therefore the differences between ce and gce are expected to disappear with increasing temperature and frequency .",
    "we first discuss the polarisability in the gce .      due to the ergodicity property in the diffusive regime ,",

    "the polarisability is simply equal to the flux dependence of the trace of the screened potential : @xmath179 since the trace is independent of the basis which is considered , this quantity is independent of the magnetic flux",

    "this disorder dependence of @xmath198 is illustrated on figure [ xetw ] .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetopolarisability decreases with the electron density @xmath199 , since the conductance increases and the screening length decreases with @xmath199 .",

    "the ring geometry is particularly favorable in order to observe this effect .",

    "just as previously discussed in the absence of screening , the flux dependence of the energy denominators compensates exactly the one of the matrix element .",
