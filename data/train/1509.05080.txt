    "in a dynamically stable non - coplanar triple the gravitational interaction between the inner and outer binary drives periodic / quasi - periodic variations of the mutual inclination between the two orbits and of the eccentricity of the inner binary  @xcite .",
    "such eccentricity oscillations , first discovered by @xcite , can lead to a close approach between the inner binary components which can produce a variety of exotic astrophysical phenomena , including compact - object and stellar binary mergers  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the standard approach is to make use of the so - called orbit - averaging technique in which one computes the mutual gravitational interaction  ( torques ) between two mass weighted ellipses instead of point masses on orbits .",
    "the basic assumption is that the evolution of the orbital parameters occur on a timescale much longer than the dynamical timescales of the system  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the orbit averaged equations of motion can describe the evolution of a wide range of systems , but become inaccurate once the triple hierarchy is moderate .",
    "@xcite showed that the orbit - average treatment , even at the octupole level of approximation , becomes inaccurate in hierarchical systems where the tertiary comes closer to the inner binary than a certain distance . at the high eccentricity phase of a lk cycle the timescale for the angular momentum perturbation due to the tertiary can become comparable to or shorter than the dynamical timescales of the system rendering the secular approach no longer valid   @xcite . in this case , the binary can be driven to a much closer separation than the secular theory would otherwise predict .",
    "this can have important consequences for the evolution of the inner binary .",
    "for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that in this non - secular regime , a compact object binary can be pushed inside the @xmath3hz gravitational wave  ( gw ) frequency band of advanced ligo  ( aligo ) detectors with a finite eccentricity .",
    "similarly , in the case of stellar binaries , the two stars could be driven to a direct collision . @xcite and @xcite suggested that direct stellar collisions driven by the lk mechanism might have an important role in the formation of blue straggler stars  ( bsss ) in stellar clusters .",
    "globular clusters  ( gcs ) are a natural environment for forming triples and higher order multiples . on one hand ,",
    "the dense stellar environment of gcs is hostile to triples .",
    "in fact , given the high densities of gcs , triples may be involved in close encounters which tend to destroy them . on the other hand , the high stellar densities that characterize the core of gcs favor dynamical binary - binary interactions that naturally lead to the formation of stable triples   @xcite , including black hole  ( bh ) triples and mixed , compact object - star , triples that could not otherwise form .",
    "the inner binaries in the triples may be driven to merge before their next interaction .",
    "interestingly , such mergers have been suggested as a channel for the formation of compact - object mergers  @xcite , and more recently as a channel for the formation of bsss through mass transfer and merger  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the evolution of dynamically assembled triples inside gcs with particular focus on triples containing an inner main - sequence  ( ms ) stellar binary and triples with an inner bh binary .",
    "we do not consider here the evolution of mixed star - compact object systems , or binaries containing evolved ( e.g. , red giant ) stars ; we reserve a study of these latter systems to a future investigation . in this paper",
    "we use a monte carlo code to simulate the long - term evolution of gcs  @xcite , and identify all triple systems formed during the cluster evolution .",
    "we then evolved these triples using a high - accuracy direct three - body integrator which includes tidal and general relativity ( gr ) effects for both the inner and outer orbit .",
    "scattering with other stars is also accounted for , but only in the sense that the triples are evolved for a time equal to the timescale over which they will be disrupted through gravitational encounters with other stars .",
    "the results of the direct integrations are used to determine the rate of bh and stellar binary mergers induced by the lk mechanism in gcs .",
    "although previous studies have shown that triples can form quite frequently in gcs , their detailed long - term dynamical evolution in the cluster environment has not been yet investigated .",
    "our study sheds light on exactly this point , i.e. it allows us to assess for the first time the role of the host cluster evolution and its properties on the formation and dynamics of the triples .",
    "this allows us to place reliable constraints on the contribution of mergers from triples to bss populations and on the event rate and properties of inspiraling bh binaries as a source of gw radiation for aligo detectors  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the dynamics of triples with either an inner stellar or compact object component has been investigated by many authors and in a variety of contexts   ( including stellar triples , planets around stars , supermassive bh mergers ) , using the standard orbit averaged formalism and therefore fully neglecting non - secular effects   ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the new ingredients of our study compared to previous work dealing with similar problems are : ( i ) the use of realistic initial conditions for our triple populations , that were directly obtained using monte carlo models of the long - term dynamical evolution of gcs ; ( ii ) the use of accurate three - body integrations that allows an essentially exact treatment of the triple dynamics , avoiding the approximations that are made when using the secular equations of motion .",

    "we use a high accuracy three - body integrator to study how the inner binary in the triples might evolve to become a possible source of gw radiation for aligo detectors , or , in the case of stellar binaries , how the evolution might lead to a mass transfer event or even a stellar merger .",
    "we begin in the next section by describing the initial conditions and numerical methods adopted in our study .",
    "the direct three - body integrations presented below were performed using the archain integrator  @xcite .",
    "archain employs an algorithmically regularized chain structure and the time - transformed leapfrog scheme to accurately integrate the motion of arbitrarily tight binaries with arbitrarily large mass - ratio .",
    "the code also includes post - newtonian  ( pn ) non - dissipative 1pn , 2pn and dissipative 2.5pn corrections to all pair - forces .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more detailed description of archain .",
    "we also used the octupole level secular equations of motion given in @xcite to evolve the systems , which allowed us to directly compare the predictions of the direct integrations to the orbit averaged results .    in the case of triples containing an inner stellar binary ( stellar triples ) , to the pn terms we also added terms that account for dissipative tides as well as apsidal precession induced by tidal bulges . in order to do so we modified archain including terms to the equations of motion which represent tidal friction and quadrupolar distortion .",
    "velocity - dependent forces were included via the generalized mid - point method described in @xcite ; this method allows to time - symmetrize the algorithmic regularization leapfrog even when the forces depend on velocities , permitting the efficient use of extrapolation methods .",

    "equation  ( [ tides - f ] ) differs from the classical treatment of near - equilibrium tides to the extent that we have suppressed terms that are due to the difference in rotation rate between the binary and each component .",

    "the evolution of the two systems was computed using both the secular equations of motion and archain .",
    "the examples of figure  [ examples ] demonstrate how the double - orbit - averaging procedure can lead to misleading results when applied to the dynamics of systems that evolve to attain very high orbital eccentricities . in the upper panel",
    "the three - body integration predicts that the inner binary will merge within a few lk oscillations whereas the secular calculation predicts that the system does not merge in the considered time interval .",
    "more importantly , in the direct three - body integration the binary was found to have a substantial eccentricity of @xmath81 at the moment its peak gravitational wave frequency ( equation  [ [ gw_f ] ] below ) reached @xmath3hz . in the lower panel",
    "the stellar binary also attains higher eccentricities when integrated with archain , which might induce a mass transfer event or reduce the circularization time due to tidal friction when compared to the secular integrations .",
    "the initial conditions for the triple systems used in this analysis were taken from the monte carlo simulations of @xcite .",
    "this study presents 42 monte carlo dynamical simulations of massive star clusters containing large populations of stellar bhs .",
    "the monte carlo technique simulates two - body relaxation in the fokker - planck approximation through representative pair - wise scattering interactions  .    our implementation in the cluster monte carlo ( cmc ) code  ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) includes direct integration of strong three- and four - body ( binary  single and binary  binary ) encounters , direct physical collisions , single and interacting binary stellar evolution , and tidal interactions with the galaxy .",
    "primordial triples are not included in these models .",
    "however , during strong binary  binary interactions , it is possible to form stable hierarchical triple systems @xcite .",
    "limitations in cmc currently require that these triples be broken artificially at the end of the timestep .",
    "nonetheless , whenever a stable triple is formed , its properties are logged , including the masses , radii , and star types for the stellar components , and the semi - major axes and eccentricities for the inner and outer orbits .",
    "since we lack the information regarding the mutual orientation of the two orbits , we sample @xmath82 and @xmath83 randomly from a uniform distribution with @xmath84 . the initial orbital phases in the three - body integrations were also randomly distributed .",
    "we extracted the properties for every stable triple system formed through dynamical interactions over 12 gyr across all of the 42 models presented in morscher et al .",
    "2015 , and from five additional models provided by the same authors ( morscher , private communication ) .",

    "we note that , because these triple systems are destroyed in the monte carlo simulation , it is possible for the components of these triples to subsequently form new triple systems , when in reality they could in principle survive for a significant period of time .    in the high - density stellar environment of gcs , triples may be perturbed through encounters with other passing stars on timescales that can be shorter than the relevant lk timescale .",

    "the total number of bh mergers obtained when using the orbit averaged equations of motion was 1796 instead .",
    "we found that the merger time of such binaries after the triple was formed was typically very short and always shorter than @xmath102yr .",
    "thus , the bh mergers discussed in what follows will occur inside the gcs even when the recoil velocity at formation can be large enough to eject the triple from the cluster core . in this section",

    "also , most bh mergers are found to occur in moderately hierarchical triples with @xmath105 .",
    "this is expected for at least two reasons : ( 1 ) the closer the outer body to the inner binary the less significant is the quenching of the lk cycles due to relativistic precession of the inner binary  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that typically the smaller the ratio @xmath71 the larger the maximum eccentricity attained by the inner binary and , consequently , the shorter its merger time ; ( 2 ) triples with small @xmath71 ratio , have also larger @xmath106 ratio , which naturally leads to a higher chance for a merger before the triple is disrupted by gravitational encounters with other stars . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we also identify those systems for which at least one of the 10 random realizations led to a merger ( blue points ) and those for which at least one realization produced a bh binary merger with an eccentricity larger than 0.9 at @xmath107hz frequency ( red symbols ) .",

    "the distributions showed in figures [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] were obtained by weighing the number of mergers for each cluster model by the likelihood of that model to represent a typical gc in the milky way  ( mw ) .",
    "more in detail , the weights are obtained by creating a kernel density estimate ( @xmath111 ) of the mw gcs on the fundamental plane ( which we take to be mass and ratio of the half to core radius ) , then estimating the weight for each model using the kernel density estimate at the position of that model on the fundamental plane . in this way ,",

    "we have to multiply the rates in table  ii of @xcite by the expected fraction of all compact object mergers that are dynamically assembled in star clusters . taking this fraction to be @xmath174 of all ns - ns mergers  @xcite , and assuming that @xmath210 of these are eccentric inspirals results in @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 for the low , realistic , and high detection rates for binary nss .",
    "these estimates appear to be in good agreement with the rate of @xmath216 we previously computed .",
    "although very simplified , the simple calculations presented above show that , even when assuming a uniform rate of mergers , the rate of eccentric ns binaries in the aligo frequency band is likely 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the realistic estimates for eccentric bh binaries forming through the lk mechanism in gcs .    *",
    "massive black hole mediated compact - object mergers in galactic nuclei .",
    "* @xcite studied the evolution of compact object binaries orbiting a mbh . near the galactic center , where orbits are nearly keplerian , binaries form a triple system with the mbh in which this latter represents the outer perturber of the triple .",
    "the mbh can subsequently drive the inner binary orbit into high eccentricities through lk resonance , at which point the compact object binary can efficiently coalesce through gw emission .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath220 of such coalescing binaries will evolve through the dynamical non - secular evolution similar to that described in section  [ bd - oaa ] , leading to finite eccentricity sources in the aligo sensitivity window .",
    "@xcite estimated a bh - bh eccentric inspiral rate for a mw - like galaxy between @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "these rates are somewhat comparable to the rates for bh - bh mergers due to gw captures derived by @xcite ; however , they are still smaller than the rates for eccentric inspirals assembled in gcs for a mw - like galaxy given in table  1 , and , even under the most optimistic assumptions , they are still only @xmath223 of the realistic and @xmath224 of the high / optimistic rate in  @xcite",
    ".    given the realistic bh - bh detection rate with aligo of @xmath225  @xcite , the predicted overall rate of eccentric compact binary coalescence in the aligo band induced by mbh mediated lk cycles in galactic nuclei is @xmath226  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that , the overall contribution of eccentric gw sources from galactic nuclei is likely negligible compared to the rate of eccentric mergers arising from hierarchical triples in gcs .",
    "the bsss observed abundantly in all clusters have long been identified as a way of identifying important stages in the host cluster s history .",
    "however , interpretation of observed trends between the bss number and cluster properties is dependent on the relative importance of the various bss formation channels in these clusters .",
    "especially , there has been a long history of carefully considering correlations between the number of bsss produced in a cluster and several dynamically important observed cluster properties , including the total mass , total number of binaries , and the central collision / interaction rate , and what they mean @xcite .",
    "although , it has been pointed out that formation of bsss from triple - mediated interactions may be important , at least in open clusters  @xcite , this has never been self - consistently investigated in realistic and evolving cluster models @xcite .",
    "as part of this study we have considered evolution of triples created dynamically in the cluster models and analyzed them as potential bss progenitors .",
    "upon comparison of the estimated numbers of the bsss resulting from triple - mediated formation channels to those formed via binary - mediated channels ( mass transfer and physical collisions due to binary - mediated interactions ) , we find that , at least for gc - like densities , contribution from triple - mediated channels is quite low .    for the triple - mediated bsss",
    ", we did not consider whether upon formation the rejuvenated ms star will remain in the region expected of bsss in a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the rejuvenated lifetime of bsss is model dependent and hard to estimate . for the binary - mediated bsss",
    "we assume full - mixing of hydrogen . in case of triple - mediated bsss",
    ", we simply compare the total number of bsss created throughout the lifetime of the gc and that formed within the last @xmath197 and with mass @xmath195 .",
    "thus , the actual contribution from triple - mediated interaction may be even lower if many of these bsss evolve off of their rejuvenated ms before the observation time of @xmath196 .",
    "we note that above we have not considered bss formation through binary evolution in short period binaries affected by the lk mechanism coupled with tidal friction .",
    "the shrinkage of the inner binary semi - major axis as well as the high eccentricities induced via the lk mechanism , combined with an expansion in the size of each inner binary star , could lead to coalescing / strongly - interacting post - ms binaries . in order to address the importance of this alternative channel we determined whether the stars would undergo mass transfer by requiring their periapsis distance to be smaller than the roche limit computed through equation  ( [ roche ] ) and setting the stellar radius of the most massive component equal to that evaluated at the tip of the red giant branch  @xcite .",
    "the periapsis distance was evaluated using the orbital parameters at the end of the three - body integrations .",
    "we only considered stars with mass @xmath227 so that their ms life time was shorter than the host gc age .",
    "also , we did not consider systems that will have undergone mass transfer on the red giant branch even without the help of lk cycles and tidal dissipation .",
    "we found that only 694 of the total 19073 binaries that did not merge during the ms would merge on the red giant branch through a combination of lk cycles , tidal friction and the expansion of the stellar radius caused by stellar evolution .",
    "this calculation suggests that the number of bsss formed through a combination of lk dynamics and stellar evolution in our models is negligible .    finally , note that we did not consider primordial triples that could somewhat increase the number of mergers from stellar triples shown in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "however , we think that mergers occurring in primordial triples will have a negligible contribution to bsss compared to mergers from dynamically assembled triples .",
    "in fact , due to the high stellar densities of gcs the outer binaries in primordial triples are likely to be involved in several dynamical encounters which will lead to their disruption in the first few gyrs of cluster evolution .",
    "the majority of triples in the catalog of @xcite have outer period @xmath228days , which according to equation  ( [ coll ] ) corresponds to a typical survival time @xmath229yr within the core of a gc and  @xmath230 in the cluster outskirts  ( see also fig . 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , given the old age of gcs stellar merger products that occurred in primordial triples would have already evolved off the main sequence , so that only dynamically formed triples could then produce bsss at later stages of cluster evolution .",
    "in this paper we studied the long - term evolution of dynamically assembled triples in gcs .",
    "the initial conditions for the triples were obtained directly from detailed monte carlo models of the clusters .",
    "these systems consisted mostly of triples containing an inner stellar binary and triples containing a pair of bhs .",
    "the triple initial conditions were integrated forward in time using a high accuracy three - body integrator which incorporates relativistic corrections and tidal terms to the equations of motion .",
    "the direct integrations allowed us , for the first time , to put constraints on the contribution of the lk mechanism to the population of coalescing bh binaries and bsss in gcs .",
    "the main results of our study are briefly summarized below .",
    "\\(1 ) we find that for the majority of dynamically assembled triple systems in gcs , the time - scale for changes of angular momentum during the high eccentricity phase of a lk cycle becomes shorter than the orbital time - scales .",
    "we conclude that the standard orbit average equations of motion , often employed in previous studies , can not accurately describe the evolution of such triples .",
    "\\(2 ) bh triples assembled dynamically in gcs often evolve such that the inner binary angular momentum changes on timescales of order or shorter than the inner binary orbital period ( see figure  [ examples ] ) .",
    "this can lead to the formation of eccentric gw sources in the frequency band of aligo detectors  ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "\\(3 ) we estimated a realistic aligo detection rate of bh binary mergers due to the lk mechanism of @xmath0 .",
    "we also compared this rate to that for bh mergers due to other processes  ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we find that mergers induced by lk oscillations are likely to be the main contributor to in - cluster gw sources for aligo detectors , and represent @xmath175 of the total detection rate of bh binary mergers assembled in gcs .",
    "\\(4 ) about @xmath1 of all lk mechanism induced bh mergers in gcs will have an eccentricity larger than @xmath231 at @xmath128 frequency , such that eccentric waveform templates and/or dedicated search strategies will be needed for their efficient detection ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "most of these eccentric sources will have an extremely large eccentricity  ( @xmath232 ) at the moment they first enter the aligo frequency band . assuming perfect waveform templates , we find a possible detection rate for eccentric mergers as large as a few events a year with aligo .",
    "we also show that the triple channel is likely the dominant formation mechanism for the production of eccentric inspirals that will be potentially detectable by aligo .",
    "\\(5 ) in the case of triples containing a stellar binary , the inner binary angular momentum often changes on timescales shorter than the tertiary orbital period , but rarely shorter than the _ inner _ binary orbital period .",
    "this implies that `` clean '' collisions between two stars , in which all passages prior to the collision are greater than the tidal dissipation scale , are rare ( see figure  [ period - pdf ] ) .",
    "\\(6 ) we estimated the number of bsss expected to form through mergers induced by the lk mechanism as well as those formed through other processes , including binary stellar evolution , binary - single scattering and direct collisions  ( see figure  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "we find that the contribution of lk induced mergers to the population of bss populations in gcs is typically @xmath198 of the total . even in clusters with relatively low central densities ( @xmath233 ) only up to @xmath124 of bss binaries could have formed in dynamically assembled triples .",
