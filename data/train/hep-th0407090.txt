    "in this paper we try to better understand and to analyze alternative theories of gravity depending on higher - order terms in the curvature invariant @xmath1 , in relation with some very interesting and possible cosmological application and , in particular , in relation with their capability to explain the cosmological acceleration of the universe , both in early times ( inflation ) and in present time universes .",
    "nevertheless we will focus our attention on the possible theoretical explanation of the present cosmological acceleration .",
    "+ recent astronomical observations have shown that the universe is accelerating at present time ( see @xcite and @xcite for supernova observation results ; see @xcite for the observations about the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmbr ) ; see @xcite for the results about the power spectrum of large - scale structure ) .",
    "physicists have thus to face the evidence of the acceleration of the universe and should give a coherent theoretical explanation to these experimental results : a problem which up to now seems to be still unsolved ! general relativity in interaction with a perfect - fluid like matter and the cosmological principle , providing the standard cosmological models , fail to give by their own a theoretical framework to explain the acceleration of the universe .",
    "we are thus forced to introduce some kind of _ dark matter or dark energy _ , which are responsible for the acceleration of the universe , or to modify general relativity such that acceleration is predicted ( see for example @xcite ) . +",
    "dark matter or dark energy models have been deeply investigated in relation with their capability of explaining the acceleration of the universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) , however up to now there are no satisfactory experimental evidences of the presence of the predicted amount of dark energy in the universe .",
    "the real nature of dark energy , which is required by general relativity in this cosmological context , is unknown but it is fairly well accepted that dark energy should behave like a fluid with a large negative pressure .",
    "the dark energy models with effective equation of state @xmath2 ( which determines the relation between pressure @xmath3 and density of matter @xmath4 ) smaller than @xmath5 are currently preferrable , owing to the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "+ on the other side the simplest way of obtaining accelerated expansions within general relativity is to introduce a positive cosmological constant @xcite , an introduction which leads however to some theoretical and experimental problems and contradictions ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we just want to stress here that models with a constant cosmological constant are not able to explain the evolution between different epochs of the universe , characterized by different values of acceleration ( deceleration ) .",
    "+ the other possibility is to assume that we do not yet understand gravity at large scales , which means that general relativity should be modified or replaced by alternative gravitational theories of gravity when the curvature of spacetime is small ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , providing modified friedmann equations .",
    "hints in this direction are suggested moreover from the quantization on curved spacetimes , when interactions among the quantum fields and the background geometry or the self interaction of the gravitational field are considered .",
    "it follows that the standard hilbert - einstein lagrangian has to be suitably modified by means of corrective terms , which are essential in order to remove divergences @xcite .",
    "these corrective terms result to be higher - order terms in the curvature invariants such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or non minimally coupled terms between scalar fields and the gravitational field .",
    "it is moreover interesting that such corrective terms to the standard hilbert - einstein lagrangian can be predicted in higher dimensions by some time - dependent compactification in string / m - theory ( see @xcite ) and corrective terms of this type arise surely in brane - world models with large spatial extra dimensions @xcite . as a matter of facts ,",
    "if these brane models are the low energy limit of string theory , it is likely that the field equations include in particular the gauss - bonnet term , which in five dimensions is the only non - linear term in the curvature which yields second order field equations . in this framework",
    "gauss - bonnet corrections should be taken into account and cosmological models deriving from the gauss - bonnet have been recently studied ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "+ as an alternative to extra dimensions , it is also possible to explain the modification to friedmann equations ( which could provide a theoretical explanation for the acceleration of the universe ) by means of a modified theory of four dimensional gravity .",
    "the first attempts in this direction were performed by adding to the standard hilbert - einstein lagrangian analytical terms in the ricci scalar curvature invariant @xcite . a simple task to modify general relativity , when the curvature is very small , is hence to add to the lagrangian of the theory a piece which is proportional to the inverse of the scalar curvature @xmath10 or to replace the standard hilbert - einstein action by means of polynomial - like lagrangians , containing both positive and negative powers of the ricci scalar @xmath6 and logarithmic - like terms .",
    "such theories have been analyzed and studied both in the metric @xcite and the palatini formalisms @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it results that both in the metric and the palatini formalism they provide a possible theoretical explanation to the present time acceleration of the universe .",
    "moreover a mechanism ruling the present dark energy dominance transitting from values below @xmath11 to values above @xmath11 is actually preferable @xcite . ]",
    "( due to the universe expansion ) and the present cosmic acceleration has been proposed in this framework ; see @xcite . +",
    "a discussion is open on the physical reliability of the palatini and/or the metric formalism @xcite and on the physical relevant frame both in the metric and the palatini formalism @xcite . up to now",
    "it appears that the aforementioned metric approach leads to results which are in contrast with the solar system experiments and also that the relevant fourth order field equations suffer serious instability problems @xcite . on the contrary the palatini formalism produces second order field equations which are not afflicted by instability problems and are in acceptable accordance with the results of the solar system experiments @xcite .",
    "a discussion is actually open on the accordance of the palatini formalism with the electron - electron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "+   + the importance of modified theories of gravity depending on general analytical functions of the ricci scalar is also related with the possibility of avoiding singularities in these cosmological models @xcite and in the interpretation of black holes entropy in this context @xcite . recently",
    ", an explanation of the present day acceleration of the universe has been moreover formulated in the framework of non - symmetric gravitational theories @xcite and in modified theories depending on the determinant of the ricci tensor @xcite . +   + encouraged by recent developments of cosmological applications of alternative theories of gravity we consider in this paper ricci squared lagrangians in minimal interaction with matter , which have been deeply analyzed in @xcite in the vacuum case . as we already said before such lagrangians are deeply related with quantum field theory : to remove divergences one has to add counterterms to the lagrangian which depend not only on the ricci scalar but also on the ricci and the riemann tensors @xcite .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that ricci squared lagrangians provide second order field equations in the palatini formalism , such that the universality of einstein equations and the universality of the komar energy - momentum complex hold in vacuum .",
    "these remarkable results have important implications also in cosmological models .",
    "they imply that , in some sense , field equations for ricci squared lagrangians reproduce ( apart conformal transformations ) the standard einstein field equations in the vacuum case , while in the presence of matter this equivalence might be broken .",
    "the geometrical structure of the spacetime manifold is very rich and it is endowed with an anti - khlerian structure , deriving directly from the variational principle of ricci squared lagrangians ( see @xcite ) .",
    "spacetime turns out to have a bi - metric structure , or better a so - called _ metric compatible almost - product _ as well as an _ almost - complex structure with a norden metric_. the geometrical structure of spacetime is moreover characterized by a scalar - valued structural equation , which is simply obtained by contracting field equations with the metric @xcite and controls the solutions of field equations .",
    "lagrangians based on higher - order ricci scalars which led to higher - order metric compatible polynomial structures have been considered both in purely metric and palatini formalism in @xcite . + it was moreover shown in @xcite and @xcite that ricci squared theories in vacuum give field equations equivalent to einstein field equations with a cosmological constant ,",
    "the value of which is fixed once the structural equations are solved and one particular solution of the structural equations is chosen .",
    "this fact is no longer true in the case of interaction with generic matter , where the solutions of the structural equation are dynamical ( the same happens in the case of non - linear lagrangians in the ricci scalar ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the equivalence with einstein field equations is hence broken and we obtain modified field equations , depending on the stress - energy tensor of matter involved in the theory .",
    "nevertheless , we remark that field equations are once again second order field equations in the metric field .",
    "+ for cosmological applications we consider the physical metric @xmath12 to be a robertson - walker metric and the stress - energy tensor of matter to be a perfect fluid one . in this particular framework deriving from the cosmological principle we obtain that the levi - civita metric @xmath13 is _ conformal _ to the physical metric @xmath12 , apart for a rescaling factor of the cosmological time . from our construction",
    "it follows however that the signature of @xmath13 can be arbitrarily chosen ( it can be either riemannian , or lorentzian or kleinian , apart from some restrictions deriving from field equations ) .",
    "we are consequently able to introduce a generalized hubble constant and modified friedmann equations .",
    "a comparison with the @xmath14 theories is immediate .",
    "it is striking to notice that modified friedmann equations are once more first order field equations , which prevent the appearing of instabilities as it has already been shown in the case of ricci scalar theories in @xcite .",
    "this is an important consideration giving the palatini formalism a deeper physical significance , in view of cosmological applications .",
    "+ an explicit example dealing with power lagrangians in the ricci squared invariant @xmath15 is analyzed in detail and the hubble constant is derived .",
    "it results that the deceleration parameter can be negative if particular values of @xmath16 are chosen .",
    "moreover we obtain values of @xmath2 that can be suitably fitted to the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "considerations are exposed about the _ frame changing _ , which means choosing @xmath13 to be a frw metric instead of @xmath12 .",
    "field equations and cosmological parameters are obtained and discussed also in that alternative ( _ jordan _ ) frame .",
    "+   + the paper is organized as follows : we start in section 2 by considering the case of @xmath14 lagrangians in a new matrix formalism , with the introduction of an operator @xmath17 modifying the einstein field equations @xcite .",
    "we pass in section 3 to the more complicated case of ricci squared @xmath18 lagrangians and we analyze the field equations and the structure of spacetime in the case of interaction with matter .",
    "we proceed in section 4 with cosmological applications and we obtain modified friedmann equations . in section 5",
    "we discuss the relevant example of polynomial lagrangians in the ricci squared invariant .",
    "in section 6 we consider the theory in the alternative jordan frame , where @xmath13 is assumed to be a priori the frw physical metric .",
    "we start considering non - linear lagrangians in the ricci scalar invariant @xmath14 , already treated and developed in @xcite and in @xcite in the vacuum case .",
    "we think that it is worth summarizing those theories in order to have a comparison with ricci squared theories here developed and analyzed in detail .",
    "we moreover modify the formalism introduced in @xcite to treat both ricci scalar and ricci squared theories in the same mathematical framework .",
    "+ the action for @xmath14 gravity is introduced to be : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the _ generalized ricci scalar _ and @xmath21 is the ricci tensor of a torsionless connection @xmath22 . the gravitational part of the lagrangian is controlled by a given real analytic function of one real variable @xmath14 , while @xmath23 denotes the scalar density @xmath24 of weight @xmath25 .",
    "the total lagrangian contains also a matter part @xmath26 in minimal interaction with the gravitational field , depending on matter fields @xmath27 together with their first derivatives and equipped with a gravitational coupling constant @xmath28 .",
    "+ equations of motion , ensuing from the first order  la palatini formalism are ( we assume the spacetime manifold to be a lorentzian manifold @xmath29 with @xmath30 ; see @xcite ) : @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the matter source stress - energy tensor and @xmath34 means covariant derivative with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "+ we shall use the standard notation denoting by @xmath35 the symmetric part of @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 . in order to get ( [ ffv2 ] )",
    "one has to additionally assume that @xmath26 is functionally independent of @xmath22 ; however it may contain metric covariant derivatives @xmath38 of fields .",
    "this means that the matter stress - energy tensor @xmath39 depends on the metric @xmath12 and some matter fields denoted here by @xmath27 , together with their derivatives . from ( [ ffv2 ] ) one sees that @xmath40 is a symmetric twice contravariant tensor density of weight @xmath25 , so that if not degenerate one can use it to define a metric @xmath41 such that the following holds true @xmath42 this means that both metrics @xmath13 and @xmath12 are conformally equivalent .",
    "the corresponding conformal factor can be easily found to be @xmath43 ( in @xmath44 and the conformal transformation results to be : @xmath45 therefore , as it is well known , equation ( [ ffv2 ] ) implies that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "let us now introduce a ( 1,1)-tensorfield @xmath17 by @xmath48 so that ( [ ffv1 ] ) re - writes as @xmath49 where , with an abuse of notation , @xmath50  and from ( [ p_mat ] ) we obtain that @xmath51 .",

    "the operator @xmath17 is proportional to the kronecker delta . equation ( [ gen_ein ] ) is hence nothing but einstein equation for the metric @xmath12 , almost independently on the choice of the function @xmath14 , as already obtained in @xcite .",
    "also the standard einstein equation with a cosmological constant @xmath64 can be recasted into the form ( [ gen_ein ] ) .",

    "<S> alternative gravitational theories described by lagrangians depending on general functions of the ricci scalar have been proven to give coherent theoretical models to describe the experimental evidence of the acceleration of universe at present time . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we proceed further in this analysis of cosmological applications of alternative gravitational theories depending on ( other ) curvature invariants . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce ricci squared lagrangians in minimal interaction with matter ( perfect fluid ) ; we find modified einstein equations and consequently modified friedmann equations in the palatini formalism . </S>",
    "<S> it is striking that both ricci scalar and ricci squared theories are described in the same mathematical framework and both the generalized einstein equations and generalized friedmann equations have the same structure . in the framework of the cosmological principle , without the introduction of exotic forms of dark energy , we thus obtain modified equations providing values of @xmath0 in accordance with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the spacetime bi - metric structure plays a fundamental role in the physical interpretation of results and gives them a clear and very rich geometrical interpretation . </S>"
