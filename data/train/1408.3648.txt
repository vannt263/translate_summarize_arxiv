    "the necessity for a better understanding of general physical principles and mechanisms of structural transitions of polymers , such as folding , crystallization , aggregation , and the adsorption at solid and soft substrates has provoked numerous computational studies of polymer models .",
    "autocorrelation properties of such models govern the statistical accuracy of estimated expectation values of physical quantities but also help illustrate the dynamic behavior or the relaxation properties .",
    "verdier and co - workers were among the first to investigate autocorrelations of a simple lattice polymer approach , in which the brownian motion of the monomers is simulated by kinetic displacements of single monomers @xcite . by using monte carlo methods , the autocorrelation functions and relaxation times of structural quantities",
    "were calculated in order to study dynamic properties of random - coil polymer chains such as the relaxation of asphericity in lattice- model chains with and without excluded volume interaction @xcite .",
    "more recently , these studies were extended to continuous models , where autocorrelation properties of the center - of - mass velocity , rouse coordinates , end - to - end distance , end - to - end vector , normal modes , and the radius of gyration for polymer melts @xcite , and of dynamic quantities of a polymer immersed in a solution @xcite were investigated .",
    "integrated autocorrelation times are also employed to judge the efficiency of importance - sampling algorithms @xcite .",
    "however , much less is known about how autocorrelation times and structural transitions of polymers depend on each other .    in the past , most of the studies on analyzing the properties of the autocorrelation times focused on spin models .",
    "the second - order phase transition between ferromagnetism and paramagnetism is characterized by a divergent spatial correlation length @xmath0 at the transition point @xmath1 . in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. , infinite system size ) ,",
    "the divergent behavior is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a critical exponent @xcite .",
    "if an importance sampling monte carlo method is employed @xcite , the number of configurational updates that is needed to decorrelate the information about the history of macroscopic system states is measured by the autocorrelation time @xmath5 .",
    "it is described by the power law @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the dynamic critical exponent , which depends on the employed algorithm @xcite . however , in a system of finite size , the correlation length can never really diverge .",
    "this is because the largest possible cluster has the volume @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the system size and @xmath10 is the dimensionality .",
    "thus , the divergence of the correlation length as well as the autocorrelation time are `` cut off '' at the boundary , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , @xmath12 at temperatures sufficiently close to the critical point @xcite . for local updates , such as",
    "single spin flips , and by using the metropolis algorithm @xcite , the autocorrelation time becomes very large near the critical temperature because the dynamic critical exponent is in this case @xmath13 .",
    "this effect is usually called critical slowing down , but it can be reduced significantly if non - local updates , such as in swendsen - wang , wolff , and multigrid algorithms @xcite , are employed .",
    "metropolis simulations with local updates yield for the ising model @xmath14 in 2d and @xmath15 in 3d @xcite . for non - local updates ,",
    "numerical estimates yield a @xmath7 value less than unity @xcite .",
    "since most phase transitions in nature are of first order @xcite , it is also useful to discuss autocorrelation properties near first - order phase transitions . in a finite system ,",
    "the characteristic feature of a first - order transition is the double - peaked energy distribution with an entropic suppression regime between the two peaks .",
    "the dip is caused by the entropic contribution to the boltzmann factor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ( reduced ) interface tension and @xmath18 is the projected area of the interfaces .",
    "thus , the dynamics in a canonical ensemble will suffer from the `` supercritical slowing down '' , in which the tremendous average residence time the system spends in a pure phase is described by the autocorrelation time @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "since this slowing down is related to the shape of the energetic probability distribution itself , it is impossible to reduce the autocorrelation time by using cluster or multigrid algorithms .",
    "the simulation in a generalized ensemble , such as multicanonical ensemble , where the slowing down can be reduced to a powerlike behavior with @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) @xcite , can overcome this difficulty .    in this paper , we will investigate autocorrelation properties of different quantities for elastic , flexible polymers , described by a simple coarse - grained model .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of the system is simulated by local monomer displacement and metropolis monte carlo sampling , resembling brownian dynamics in a canonical ensemble .",
    "the goal is to identify structural transitions and transition temperatures for this model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",

    "the conformation is changed by a random local displacement of a monomer .",
    "once a monomer is randomly chosen , its position is changed within a small cubic box with edge lengths @xmath36 . denoting the inverse thermal energy by @xmath37 , with @xmath38 in our simulations , the probability of accepting such an update",

    ", an update will be directly accepted if @xmath42 . if @xmath43 , the update will be accepted only with the probability @xmath44 , where @xmath45 . in each simulation , we performed about @xmath46 sweeps after extensive equilibration .",
    "a sweep contains @xmath9 monte carlo steps , where @xmath9 is the number of monomers for a chosen polymer .",
    "suppose a time series with a large number of data from an importance sampling mc simulation has been generated , the expectation value of any quantity @xmath47 can be estimated by calculating the arithmetic mean over the markov chain , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the value of @xmath47 in the @xmath50th measurement and @xmath51 is the number of total measurements . in equilibrium ,",
    "the expectation value of @xmath52 is the same as the expectation value of the individual measurement @xmath53 because of time - translational invariance . in metropolis simulations",
    ", the individual measurements will not be independent .",
    "thus , by introducing the normalized autocorrelation function @xmath54 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 can be any integer in the range @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath58 , the corresponding variance of @xmath52 is calculated as @xcite @xmath59 . \\label{mean_var_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for large time separation @xmath60 , the autocorrelation function decays exponentially , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the exponential autocorrelation time of @xmath47 . because of large statistical fluctuations in the tail of @xmath63 , the accurate estimation of @xmath62 is often difficult . by introducing the integrated autocorrelation time , @xmath64 eq .   becomes @xmath65 with the effective statistics @xmath66 . according to eq .",
    ", in any meaningful simulation with @xmath67 , we can safely neglect the correction term in the parentheses in eq .  .",
    "this leads to the frequently employed definition of the integrated autocorrelation time , @xmath68 the estimation of the integrated autocorrelation time requires the replacement of the expectation value in @xmath63 by mean values , e.g. , @xmath69 and @xmath70 by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , it is useful to introduce the following estimator @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the estimator of @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath74 usually decays to zero as @xmath60 increases , @xmath75 will finally converge to a constant .",
    "because of the statistical noise of @xmath74 for large @xmath60 , @xmath76 is obtained by averaging @xmath74 over several independent runs .",
    "the standard estimator for the variance of @xmath47 is @xmath77 and its expected value is @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "it is obvious that this form systematically underestimates the true value by a term of the order of @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath81 correction is the systematic error due to the finiteness of the time series , and it is called bias . even in the case",
    "in which all the data are uncorrelated ( @xmath82 ) , the estimator is still biased , @xmath83 .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to define the bias - corrected estimator @xmath84 which satisfies @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the bias - corrected estimator for the squared error of the mean value becomes @xmath86 for uncorrelated data , the error formula simplifies to @xmath87    integrated autocorrelation times can also be estimated by using the so - called binning method .",
    "assuming that the time series consists of @xmath51 correlated measurements @xmath88 , this time series can be divided into @xmath89 bins , which should be large enough so that the correlation of the data in each bins decays sufficiently ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "in this way , a set of @xmath89 uncorrelated data subsets is generated , each of which contains @xmath91 data points such that @xmath92 .",
    "the binning block average @xmath93 of the @xmath60-th block is calculated as @xmath94 and @xmath95 coincides with the average . since each bin average represents an independent measurement , the variance of the binning block averages @xmath96 can be estimated from eq .  , @xmath97 and the statistical error of the mean value @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 by comparing this expression with eq .   and",
    "considering eqs .   and",
    ", we see that @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the autocorrelation time can also be estimated by means of the binning variance as @xmath101 since the bin averages are supposed to be uncorrelated , we utilized the standard estimator for the variance of the individual measurements @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "this method is more convenient than the integration method since a precise estimate of the autocorrelation function is not needed . for uncorrelated data and @xmath104 ,",
    "@xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "consequently @xmath107 . in the correlated case",
    ", too small bin sizes will underestimate the autocorrelation time . given a time series consisting of @xmath51 measurements , the estimator @xmath108 remains unchanged if @xmath91 is modified .",
    "increasing @xmath91 reduces the number of bins @xmath89 which leads to the decrease of the variance @xmath109 . however , the decrease rate is not the same as @xmath91 is increased .",
    "thus , the right hand side of will converge to a constant value identical to @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , one typically plots the right hand side of eq .   for various values of @xmath91 and",
    "estimates @xmath110 by reading the value the curve converges to @xcite .",
    "for the interpretation of the autocorrelation times of energy , square end - to - end distance , square radius of gyration , and number of contacts , it is helpful to first investigate thermodynamic properties of these quantities .",
    "we have plotted the mean values of energy and number of contacts in fig .",

    "the number of contacts is a simple discrete order parameter which is also helpful in distinguishing phases .",
    "it has proven to be particularly useful in studies of lattice models @xcite . in the continuous model used here ,",

    "the two clear peaks at @xmath113 of the latter represent the collapse transition of the 30-mer .",
    "note that the fluctuations of energy and contact number in fig .",
    "[ canonical_quantities](b ) do not exhibit a peak at the transition point , but only a `` shoulder '' .",
    "as the temperature decreases , dissolved or random coils ( gas phase ) collapse in a cooperative arrangement of the monomers , and compact globular conformations ( liquid phase ) are favorably formed . as the temperature decreases further , the polymer transfers from the globular phase to the `` solid '' phase which is characterized by locally crystalline or amorphous metastable structures . a corresponding peak and valley which mark the liquid - solid ( crystallization ) or freezing transition of the 30-mer",

    "the error of @xmath121 is estimated by @xmath131 because all runs were performed independently of each other .",
    "the consistency of the two different methods used for the estimation of autocorrelation times for the investigated quantities become apparent from table  [ table1 ] , where we have listed the autocorrelation time estimate for three temperatures below , near , and above the @xmath132 point .",
    "the results coincide within the numerical error bars .    in order to estimate the integrated autocorrelation time systematically , we performed least - squares fitting for all the curves in both the integration method of the autocorrelation function and binning analysis at each temperature .",
    "the empirical fit function for any quantity @xmath47 is chosen to be of the form @xmath133 where @xmath134 represents @xmath130 in the integration of the autocorrelation functions method and @xmath91 in binning analysis ; @xmath135 and @xmath136 are two fit parameters .",
    "the fitting curves , also plotted in fig .",
    "[ auto_30_seperate ] , coincide well with the mean values of the integrated autocorrelation times in the @xmath137 region , where convergence sets in .",
    "it is necessary to mention that when using the binning method to calculate error bars one needs to ensure that the binning block length is much larger than the autocorrelation time .",
    "the reason is obvious from fig .",
    "[ auto_30_seperate ] . if the autocorrelation time estimated by the binning method has not yet converged , the estimate @xmath138 is less than the integrated autocorrelation time ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "therefore , the estimated standard deviation @xmath140 underestimates the true value @xmath141 in this case , yielding a too small error estimate .",
    "after the preliminary considerations , we will now discuss how the dependence of the autocorrelation time on the temperature can be utilized for the identification of structural transitions in the polymer system .",
    "figure  [ auto_30 ] shows how the fitted estimated integrated autocorrelation times @xmath142 vary with temperature .",
    "as the comparison shows , the autocorrelation times estimated by using the binning analysis are in very good agreement with the results obtained by integrating autocorrelation functions .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation time curves of @xmath143 and @xmath144 behave similarly at most of the temperatures except the temperatures close to the freezing transition .",
    "this is not surprising as both are structural quantities that are defined to describe the compactness of the polymer .",
    "in addition , the integrated autocorrelation time curves of @xmath145 and @xmath146 behave similarly .",
    "their relation can be understood as following .",
    "the polymer conformation in the solid phase is characterized by locally crystalline or amorphous metastable structures .",
    "therefore , the main contribution of each monomer to the energy in this phase originates from the interaction between this monomer and its non - bonded nearest neighbors .",
    "this is also reflected by the number of contacts to the nearest neighbors .",
    "thus , @xmath147 in the solid phase ( see fig .",
    "the autocorrelation times of the two structural quantities are always larger than the ones of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the reason is that these quantities are not particularly sensitive to conformational changes within a single phase .",
    "furthermore , the displacement update used here does not allow for immediate substantial changes .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ time_series](a ) where the time series are shown at high temperature . from fig .  [ time_series](b ) and [ time_series](c ) ,",
    "one notices that @xmath145 and @xmath146 fluctuate more strongly than @xmath144 .    the most important observation from fig .  [ auto_30 ]",
    "is that slowing down appears near @xmath148 which signals the collapse transition .",
    "this temperature is close to the peak positions of the structural fluctuations shown in fig .",
    "[ canonical_quantities](d ) . within this temperature region",
    ", the autocorrelation time becomes extremal .",
    "large parts of the polymer have to behave cooperatively which slows down the overall collapse dynamics .",
    "near the freezing transition ( @xmath149 ) , the autocorrelation times of all four quantities rapidly increase .",
    "since metropolis simulations with local updates typically get stuck in metastable states of the polymer at low temperatures , we do not estimate autocorrelation times in the @xmath150 region .",
    "the freezing transition is , therefore , virtually inaccessible to any autocorrelation time analysis based on local - update metropolis simulations .",
    "this is amplified by the fact that the autocorrelation time increase naturally at low temperatures , because of the low entropy .",
    "that means if there would be a signal of the freezing transition at all in the autocorrelation time curves , it would be difficult to identify it .",
    "the autocorrelation times of @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath146 seem to converge to constant values at high temperatures , whereas the autocorrelation time of @xmath145 decays .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the structural quantities and @xmath146 possess upper limiting values that are reached at high temperatures , thereby reducing the fluctuation width at constant displacement range .",
    "this is a particular feature of the results obtained in simulations with fixed maximum displacement and it is different if the acceptance rate is kept constant instead .",

    "[ auto_55 ] , we notice that the behavior is qualitatively the same , but the autocorrelation times of all quantities are larger than the ones for the 30-mer , as expected .",
    "this supports our hypothesis that the qualitative behavior of the autocorrelation times of the 30-mer is generic and representative for autocorrelation properties of larger polymers .",
    "in particular , this method offers a possible way for the identification of transitions , where standard canonical analysis of quantities such as the specific heat fails .          in order to find out how the autocorrelation time changes at a fixed acceptance rate rather than at a fixed maximum displacement range",
    ", we used the binning method to calculate the integrated autocorrelation times at different constant acceptance rates @xmath154 for different temperatures near the collapse transition for the 30-mer .",
    "the results for the energetic autocorrelation times @xmath155 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fixed_accp](a ) , measured for five different temperatures .",
    "autocorrelation times of the other quantities exhibit a similar behavior .",
    "two important conclusions can be drawn : ( i ) the values of the autocorrelation times depend on acceptance rate and temperature , but ( ii ) the monotonic behavior of @xmath156 as a function of @xmath157 is virtually independent of the temperature .",
    "thus , if multiplied by a temperature - independent empirical modification factor @xmath158 the modified autocorrelation time curves become almost independent of @xmath157 at these temperatures ( see fig .",

    "one notices that the peaks indicating the collapse transition are more pronounced than the ones in the fixed maximum displacement case , but qualitatively ( and quantitatively regarding the @xmath132 transition point ) this modified approach leads to similar results . in the temperature range investigated here ,",
    "the autocorrelation times of all quantities seem to decrease above the @xmath132 point .",
    "this is different than the behavior at fixed maximum displacement range ( cp .",
    "[ auto_30](a ) ) .",
    "employing the metropolis monte carlo algorithm , we have performed computer simulations of a simple coarse - grained model for flexible , elastic polymers to investigate the autocorrelation time properties for different quantities .",
    "two different methods were employed to estimate autocorrelation times as functions of temperatures for polymers with 30 and 55 monomers : by integration of autocorrelation functions and by using the binning method .",
    "the results obtained for different energetic and structural quantities by averaging over more than 20 independent simulations are consistent .",
    "the major result of our study is that autocorrelation time changes can be used to locate structural transitions of polymers , because of algorithmic slowing down .",
    "we deliberately employed metropolis sampling and local displacement updates , as slowing down is particularly apparent in this case .",
    "we could clearly identify the collapse transition point for the two chain lengths investigated .",
    "low - temperature transitions are not accessible because of the limitations of metropolis sampling in low - entropy regions of the state space .",
    "the identification of transitions by means of autocorrelation time analysis is , therefore , an alternative and simple method to more advanced technique such as microcanonical analysis @xcite or by investigating partition function zeros @xcite .",
