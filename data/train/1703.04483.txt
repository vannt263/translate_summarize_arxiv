    "quantum technology requires re - usable qubits  @xcite .",
    "a reliable reset to a well - defined state is vital , no matter if the quantum system in question is to be used repeatedly , e.g.  in the case of quantum computing  @xcite , or a cycle is to be performed , as required for quantum thermodynamical machines  @xcite .",
    "this implies a purification or cooling task  @xcite , since quantum systems are inevitably in contact with their environment .",
    "the corresponding entropy reduction can be achieved in two ways  by employing an auxiliary degree of freedom with lower entropy than the system for an entropy swap  @xcite or by coupling the system to a reservoir where the steady state coincides with the desired reset . the relaxation in the latter case is typically sped up by extra means  @xcite , as fast protocols are desirable for error prevention .",
    "in both settings for cooling , the entropy sink , i.e. , the environment , is a controllable resource which can at least be switched on and off at will .",
    "in addition to cooling , reset also includes the erasure of any correlations between system and environment , irrespective of the environment being natural or engineered .",
    "this aspect is typically not taken into account , due to the assumption of weak coupling . however , as has been demonstrated recently  @xcite , different cycles of a quantum heat engine do not show the same performance in the presence of intercycle coherence . in general , the assumption of negligible correlations is hardly justified in mesoscopic devices such as superconducting qubits  @xcite which are typically exposed to environments giving rise to non - markovian dynamics . here , we focus on the role of initial correlations between system and environment for qubit reset . using quantum optimal control",
    ", we show that initial correlations can not only be erased , but turn out to be an asset for purification . with initial correlations , we are able to outperform the best possible uncorrelated reset protocol both in fidelity and speed .",
    "our results suggest to actively exploit initial correlations between system and environment in quantum technology .",
    "we consider a qubit in contact with an environment which gives rise to non - factorizing dynamics . assuming the qubit was used in a quantum computation or it underwent part of a thermodynamic cycle",
    ", the task is to reset it , that is to erase the correlations with the environment and transfer the qubit into a well - defined pure state .",
    "we therefore aim at cooling the qubit _ below _ the steady state of the open system and erasing all correlations . to this end",
    ", we employ quantum optimal control theory  @xcite . by definition ,",
    "only the system , i.e. , the qubit , is controllable , the environment and the system - environment coupling are not . as there has been evidence , that non - markovian dynamics might be a resource for control tasks such as cooling  @xcite or gate implementation  @xcite , we also investigate whether entanglement and non - markovianity facilitate qubit reset .",

    "this , together with the identical temperature of qubit and tls , results in a higher von neumann entropy of qubit than tls . according to the second law of thermodynamics , one would expect the best cooling to be achieved by an entropy exchange between tls and qubit .",
    "this has indeed been observed before  @xcite .        for the chosen parameters",
    ", entropy exchange can be realized by simply swapping the ground state populations of qubit and tls .",
    "this is best achieved when qubit and tls are in resonance . as can be seen in eq .",
    ", the control field @xmath3 effectively changes the frequency of the qubit .",
    "therefore an educated guess would be to ramp qubit and tls rapidly into resonance and stay there just long enough for a full swap operation .",

    "one might wonder why the minimal time @xmath49 required for the swap in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_fact](a ) is larger than @xmath50 in eq .  .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for the sake of experimentally feasible control signals , we do not allow @xmath3 to be instantaneously switched on and off .",
    "if we relax this constraint , our optimized control reaches the quantum speed limit @xmath50 .",
    "for any time longer than @xmath50 , there is always at least one solution achieving maximal cooling , i.e. , the control strategy is not unique .",
    "another possible control field is shown exemplarily in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_fact](d ) .",
    "the non - uniqueness of the solution allows for taking into account further experimentally desirable features , such as restriction of the maximal amplitude of the control , without losing performance .      an obvious choice for a correlated initial state is the joint thermal equilibrium state   of qubit and tls .",
    "for the chosen parameters , the mutual information of this state is rather small , @xmath51 .",
    "the state is separable but has non - zero quantum discord .",
    "note that all initial states studied within this section have non - vanishing quantum discord , since for a thermalized tls there is no state with only classical correlations .        as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_corr](a , b , c ) , both cooling and erasure of correlation is achieved by the optimized control field .",

    "[ fig : dyn_corr](a ) , @xmath53 , coincides with the minimal error @xmath47 for factorizing initial states , cf .",
    "as it was more difficult ( in terms of numerical optimization ) to approach this limit for factorizing initial conditions , initial correlations seem to facilitate qubit reset .    to verify this conjecture and better understand the role of initial correlations , we relax the assumption that qubit and tls have a different level splitting and choose @xmath54 .",
    "in this case , no cooling would be possible at all for factorizing initial conditions .",
    "the initial state is given by eq .  .",
    "it is thermal in the sense that , if tls or qubit is traced out , one obtains eq .  .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_corr](d , e , f ) , for an initial state with mutual information @xmath55 and quantum discord @xmath56 , it is possible to cool and erase the correlations despite the fact that initially qubit and tls have the same frequency and temperature .",
    "this is clear evidence for system - environment correlations acting as a resource for cooling .    , which still yields an error @xmath57 .",

    "same parameters as in fig .",

    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_var](a ) , with increasing correlations , i.e. , mutual information , the error threshold of the factorizing dynamics , @xmath47 , can be reached in shorter times .",
    "note that although the upper left point in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_var](a ) lies above the approximate quantum speed limit for factorizing initial conditions , this is only due to influence of the counter rotating terms ( which we will analyze in more detail in section  [ subsec : num : crt ] ) .",
    "if we temporarily neglect the counter rotating terms , the result coincides with the quantum speed limit .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_var](b ) shows that the final error @xmath58 is reduced for increasing initial correlations .",
    "while we have also studied entangled initial states , the data is not presented here , as the results do not differ .",
    "we find that only the amount of mutual information , not the type of correlations is relevant for cooling .    to summarize our findings obtained so far , it is not only possible to reset the qubit in the presence of initial correlations ; initial correlations between system and environment can actually be used to enhance the performance of the cooling protocol .",
    "moreover , in the resonant case , initial correlations enable cooling that is impossible without their presence .",
    "we analyze the dynamics that lead to this surprising result in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : ana ] .      in the following ,",
    "we examine the influence of the counter rotating terms in the interaction hamiltonian   which can be rewritten , @xmath60 where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) are the usual lowering ( raising ) operators for two - level systems .",
    "the counter rotating terms are given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; they are often neglected as part of a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "as we will show , these terms contribute to the dynamics of qubit coupled to the tls , i.e. , the rwa is not a good approximation here .",
    "nevertheless , they have only a minor influence on the solution of the reset control problem .        in the rwa ,",
    "the interaction hamiltonian becomes @xmath65 repeating the optimizations for the factorizing initial state under the rwa yields errors that are slightly smaller ( @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_fact_rwa](a , b ) and @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_fact_rwa](c , d ) ) , compared to the case when the counter - rotating terms are included ( @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_fact](a , b ) and @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_fact](c , d ) ) . employing the optimized fields from fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_fact_rwa ] in the dynamics including the counter rotating terms ( without further optimization ) results in only slightly increased final errors @xmath70 ( a , b ) and @xmath71 ( c , d ) .",
    "the errors are thus affected only in the third digit , despite the dynamics and optimized fields in figs .",
    "[ fig : dyn_fact ] and [ fig : dyn_fact_rwa ] being visibly different .    in order to repeat this analysis for non - factorizing initial states",
    ", we have to adjust the joint thermal state of qubit and tls , @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and partition function @xmath75 with @xmath76 the optimized final error in the rwa becomes @xmath77 , compared to @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_corr](a , b , c ) . using the rwa - optimized field in the dynamics including the counter - rotating terms increases the final error to only @xmath78 .",
    "this is particularly remarkable , since not only the interaction hamiltonians differ , but also the initial states , cf . eqs .   and",
    "similarly , for very strong initial correlations , we find @xmath79 , compared to @xmath80 in fig .  [",
    "fig : dyn_corr](d , e , f ) ; and use of the rwa - optimized field in dynamics with the counter rotating terms increases the error to only @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , we find our analysis of the quantum speed limit and minimal achievable error in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_var ] to be essentially independent of the rwa .",
    "the small increase of the errors when using the rwa - optimized fields in dynamics that include the counter - rotating terms is explained by larger final residual correlations .",
    "however , the increase due to the counter - rotating terms is of the order of @xmath82 , whereas all final errors quoted above correspond to residual correlations of the order of @xmath83 .",
    "overall , the increase is thus negligible , and we conclude that the counter - rotating terms , while modifying the dynamics , have no relevant influence on the achievable final error or , in other words , the controllability of the problem .",
    "this has two important implications : first , in order to identify control solutions for the reset problem , it is sufficient to consider the interaction hamiltonian in the rwa",
    ". this will allow an analytical treatment , see sec .",
    "[ sec : ana ] below . moreover , from an experimental perspective , a loss of fidelity in the third digit is irrelevant and it might actually be advantageous to use rwa - optimized fields , since these are generally much smoother , cf .",
    "[ fig : dyn_fact](b , d ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_fact_rwa](b , d ) .",
    "finally , we investigate whether non - markovianity of the dynamics has any influence on the optimized fields and achievable final errors .",
    "the dynamics of the qubit becomes non - markovian depending on the ratio @xmath84 .",
    "we quantify this by the accessible volume of state space  @xcite to study a possible interplay between non - markovianity and control .",
    "it turns out that non - markovianity is not needed to perform the qubit reset but it also is not harmful , in the sense that the optimization does not suppress non - markovianity . in other words , if the free evolution is non - markovian , then the controlled one is also ( data not shown ) .",
    "similarly if the undriven dynamics is markovian ( according to the accessible state space volume ) , allowing for a non - zero external field does not give rise to non - markovian dynamics for the swap - like solutions .",
    "only if we impose additional constraints , for example if we limit the amplitude of the drive which necessitates for longer times @xmath31 , the driven dynamics becomes non - markovian .",
    "two observations in the analysis of the numerical results presented above allow us to simplify our model  : ( i ) solutions obtained under the rwa perform almost equally well when the counter - rotating terms are taken into account .",
    "in other words , although the rwa is not a good approximation for the dynamics , it may be invoked to determine the controls .",
    "( ii ) two different timescales are relevant to characterize the interaction of the qubit with the environment  a fast one to dump the qubit s entropy into the pseudo - mode , determined by the coupling @xmath9 , and a slow one leading to re - equilibration , determined by the coupling @xmath0 .",
    "most importantly , the re - equilibration dynamics will never increase the purity of qubit or tls above their steady state values . the minimum final error and time for the qubit reset",
    "are therefore determined only by the fast timescale dynamics .",
    "these observations suggest to neglect the dynamics associated with the slow timescale and described by the lindblad operators in eq .   as well as the counter - rotating terms in the hamiltonian  .",
    "as a result , the reset control problem becomes amenable to an analytical solution .      in the following we use concepts from geometric control theory @xcite , where the idea consists in transforming the dynamical equations of the system in such a way that the optimality condition can be expressed analytically  @xcite .",
    "for ease of the derivation , we transform states and hamiltonian into the rotating frame . neglecting the counter - rotating terms and the ( slow ) equilibration with the reservoir ,",

    "we have shown that quantum optimal control theory allows to derive protocols for qubit reset with minimal error in minimum time .",
    "such fast and reliable qubit reset is crucial for quantum devices to be used multiple times or quantum machines to operate in a cyclic way .",
    "our main assumption was that the qubit is coupled to a structured environment , consisting of a pseudo - mode and a reservoir .",
    "the coupling to the pseudo - mode is taken to be small compared to the level spacings but large enough to render the qubit dynamics non - markovian ; the coupling to the reservoir is weak . in an actual experiment , the pseudo - mode",
    "could be realized by an ancilla , and the reservoir by a resistor or a lossy cavity ",
    "scenarios that are found for example in superconducting circuits .",
    "the assumptions of our model imply two timescales  a fast one for the interaction between qubit and tls ( pseudo - mode ) and a slow one for re - equilibration with the reservoir .",
    "this timescale separation allows to solve the reset control problem analytically and evaluate the bounds for minimum error and minimum time for certain initial states and under the rotating wave approximation . assuming the tls to be initially in thermal equilibrium with the reservoir , we find different solutions to the control problem for factorizing and correlated initial states .",
    "if qubit and tls are initially uncorrelated ( and thus there are no correlations between qubit and all of the environment ) , the time - optimal solution is a swap operation . cooling and reset are thus only possible if the tls is initially colder , i.e. , purer , than the qubit .",
    "the minimal error is determined by the temperature as well as the initial difference in the qubit and tls level splittings , it becomes smaller for larger tls splitting .",
    "the minimal time is set by the coupling strength between qubit and tls .",
    "the time - optimal solution consists in ramping qubit and tls into and out off resonance .",
    "it is valid for all factorizing initial states of qubit and tls ( with the tls initially in thermal equilibrium with the reservoir ) , i.e. , no a priori knowledge of the initial qubit state is necessary .",
    "if initial correlations between qubit and environment are present , the limits on minimum error and minimum time for the uncorrelated case both can be beaten .",
    "however , in this case , knowledge of the initial state is required to derive the reset protocol since the control strategy is tied to the amount of initial correlations .",
    "both speed - up and error reduction can be understood by the geometry of the evolution in state space .",
    "remarkably , even in the case where qubit and tls are initially in resonance and cooling would not be possible at all for factorizing initial conditions , correlations allow for entropy export .",
    "initial correlations with the environment thus act as a resource for the qubit reset .",
    "quantifying the initial correlations in terms of the mutual information of qubit and tls , we have found the amounts by which error and time can be reduced to be directly linked to the mutual information . in contrast , the type of correlation turns out not to play any role . in other words ,",
    "entanglement between system and environment is not required and classical correlations are sufficient to beat the limits on error and time for factorizing initial states .",
    "our findings suggest to actively exploit initial correlations between qubit and environment in qubit reset , using either ancilla qubits or true defects .",
    "for example for superconducting qubits , the latter can be characterized precisely both in terms of level splitting and coupling  @xcite and thus effectively act like an ancilla  @xcite . for optimum performance of the qubit reset , the amount of initial correlations must be known .",
    "the idea is then to engineer the initial correlations between the qubit and its environment before carrying out the reset .",
    "this is related to algorithmic cooling where correlations are created dynamically by cross - relaxation  @xcite .",
    "however , our approach differs in two important ways  it operates at the quantum speed limit and assumes controllability only for the system , not the bath .",
    "even when correlations are not created on purpose , they emerge inevitably when components are coupled .",
    "this is ignored in theoretical proposals that assume factorizing initial conditions . executing time - optimal qubit reset with and without artificially engineered initial correlations",
    "would allow for an experimental comparison between factorizing and non - factorizing initial conditions .",
    "this would be an important step towards a better understanding of open quantum systems .",
    "enhancement of initial correlations by use of an ancialla or defect provides a fresh perspective onto quantum reservoir engineering  @xcite .",
    "so far , protocols for quantum reservoir engineering have targeted the creation of non - trivial quantum states as steady state of some driven - dissipative dynamics , see e.g.  @xcite , assuming the evolution to be markovian and the coupling to the environment to be weak .",
    "while we have found non - markovianity per se not to be relevant for the success of qubit reset , we show that strong coupling to an engineered environment allows for faster protocols and the emerging correlations to be useful for a further speed up of the evolution .",
