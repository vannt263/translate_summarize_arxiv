    "planetary nebulae represent only an ephemeral stage in the late evolution of low- to intermediate - mass stars , the predominant stellar population in late type galaxies , but their rich emission line spectra allow us to quantify the amounts of helium , and heavier elements ( mainly carbon , nitrogen , and @xmath6-process elements ) that these stars produce and return into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "recent studies have indicated that pne may also contain non - negligible amounts of endogenous oxygen and neon synthesized by intrinsic nucleosynthesis in the stellar progenitors and expelled into the nebulae following the third dredge - up , especially more so in lower metallicity environments such as those of the galactic halo ( pquignot & tsamis 2005 ) and of satellites of the galaxy ( pquignot et al .",
    "2000 ; zijlstra et al . 2006 ; leisy & dennefeld 2006 ) . their importance as vital sources of neutron - capture elements , such as for instance selenium and krypton among others ,",
    "is now observationally confirmed ( pquignot & baluteau 1994 ; sterling et al .",
    "2007 ) . with the advent of 8-m class telescopes ,",
    "pne are increasingly being used as probes of the chemical evolution of local group galaxies ( e.g. , gonalves et al .",
    "2007 ; saviane et al . 2008 ) , while by virtue of their intrinsically bright monochromatic [ o  iii ]  500.7 nm emission they have been detected in the intracluster stellar population of the coma cluster at a distance of 100mpc ( gerhard et al . 2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "a focal problem , however , remains in the astrophysics of these objects : namely that large discrepancies are measured between abundances and temperatures obtained from recombination lines and continua _ versus _ those obtained from the bright forbidden lines ( e.g. , tsamis et al .",
    "2003b , 2004 ; liu et al .",
    "2000 , 2004 ; wesson et al . 2005 ) . for the majority of more than 100 pne surveyed thus far by long - slit ( or chelle ) spectroscopy , abundances of the elements carbon , oxygen , nitrogen and neon derived from their optical recombination lines ( orls )",
    "are higher than those derived from the classic ( ` forbidden ' ) collisionally excited lines ( cels ) by factors 23 ( see review by liu 2006 and references therein ) . for about 510 per cent of the surveyed objects however the discrepancies are in the 480 range , with the most pathological case to date being hf2 - 2 ( liu et al .",
    "2006 ) , a southern planetary nebula . in the cases of carbon ,",
    "nitrogen ( tsamis 2002 ; tsamis et al .",
    "2004 ) and oxygen ( liu et al 2001 ; tsamis et al .",
    "2004 ) , large metal overabundances are correlated with lower plasma temperatures derived from orls and continua than from forbidden lines .",
    "the resolution of this problem remains of high priority as it continues to undermine our trust on secure elemental abundance determinations for pne , and for other types of emission line objects ( such as h  ii  regions ; e.g. tsamis et al 2003a ) .    in the overwhelming majority of cases the ratio of orl / cel abundances for a given heavy element ion ( the _ abundance discrepancy factor _ , adf )",
    "is not correlated with the excitation energies , @xmath7 , of the cels involved : meaning that , per individual pn , infrared ( ir ) or ultraviolet ( uv)/optical cels of low and high @xmath7  respectively , yield very comparable ionic abundances , which are uniformly lower than the corresponding abundances of the same ions derived from orls .",
    "the most likely explanation for these spectroscopic results was judged to be the presence of cold plasma regions embedded in the nebular gas in the form of relatively dense , hydrogen - poor condensations  clumps or filaments ( liu et al .",
    "2000 ; tsamis 2002 , tsamis et al .",
    "2004 ) . due to their elevated content in heavy elements ( several times solar )",
    ", these plasma regions would have reached photoionization equilibrium at lower temperatures than the ambient ` normal ' composition gas by emitting far - ir lines , the primary nebular thermostat in relatively low temperatures . since the emissivity of heavy element recombination lines",
    "is enhanced at lower temperatures , while at the same time that of the classic forbidden lines is diminished , the hydrogen - poor , heavy element - rich clumps would emit heavy element recombination lines profusely , yielding a truer estimate of the heavy element content of these regions .",
    "whereas the long - slit surveys yielded concrete evidence for elevated recombination - line abundances , the temperature of the suspected hydrogen - deficient clumps was tougher to determine since the diagnostic lines involved are faint and often suffer from blends in lower resolution spectra .",
    "nevertheless , there has been evidence from those studies for temperatures lower by several thousand k than the typical cel temperatures of photoionized nebulae ( tsamis et al 2004 ; liu et al .",
    "this is one aspect of the proposed ` dual abundance model ' solution that renders it self - consistent , something rather lacking from alternative propositions , such as small - scale temperature fluctuations in a chemically homogeneous medium ( e.g. peimbert et al .",
    "2004 ) , which do not invoke a physical process to explain the discrepancies .",
    "a major unresolved issue remains the as yet unknown origin of the high abundance clumps , and their mass relative to the total ionized nebular gas .",
    "heavy element recombination lines in nebulae can be a thousand times or more fainter than hydrogen recombination lines , in sharp contrast to the luminous forbidden lines emitted by the same heavy ions .",
    "we therefore brought to bear on this thorny issue the combination of integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) and the light collecting power of the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "ifs techniques allow spectra to be obtained from every spatial element in a two - dimensional field of view , combined with imaging capability of the field at any wavelength across a given @xmath8 range .",
    "this is usually achieved by means of an ifu array composed of microlenses coupled to optical fibres or slicers ( e.g. allington - smith 2006 ) .",
    "these are fed into a spectrograph and are subsequently individually imaged on the focal plane of the telescope .",
    "the contiguous array of microlenses ( or spatial pixels  ` spaxels ' ) can also be thought of as a series of long - slits stacked together and , in this sense , an ifu of @xmath9 @xmath1 @xmath10 spaxels used on a single telescope is equivalent to using an array of @xmath9 telescopes equipped with long slits of @xmath10 pixels each .",
    "it could be argued that in the former case a given observing programme is executed @xmath9 times faster than when using a classic long - slit spectrograph . in reality",
    "this is not strictly true as invariably there are some light losses associated with ifu fibres and their optical connection to the spectrograph ( particularly at the interfaces with the microlenses and the feed into the slit ) .",
    "overall , ifu observations afford considerable advantages especially in a science programme like ours where faint diagnostic lines are targeted , and where 2d mapping of nebular regions is sought in the hope of isolating suspect metal - rich regions which may _ a priori _ have a random spatial distribution in the nebula .    in addition , ifs data can provide the much - needed input to fully realize the capabilities of new plasma codes such as those developed in recent years for the 3d modelling of photoionized nebulae ( e.g. ercolano et al .",
    "2003 ; morisset et al .",
    "for example , such codes can produce simulated 3d or 2d spectral images of model nebulae at arbitrary wavelengths and inclinations that can be readily evaluated using images obtained by ifs .",
    "moreover , high spectral resolution ifs data such as those we obtained for ngc7009 ( walsh et al . in preparation ) can yield detailed information on the velocity field of an object that could allow a 3d kinematical model to be built .",
    "these are some of the wider aspects of this work .    here",
    "we pursue a physicochemical analysis of three representative pne belonging to the galactic - disk population with published oxygen adfs ranging from @xmath4 2  10 .",
    "long - slit spectroscopy of the targets has been published : ngc5882 ( tsamis et al . 2003b , 2004 ) ; ngc6153 ( liu et al .",
    "2000 ) ; ngc7009 ( liu et al . 1995 ; hereafter lsbc ) . in those studies , the first two targets were observed with a long slit scanned across the whole nebular surface .",
    "this technique , which was applied throughout the long - slit surveys , yielded _",
    "mean _ relative emission line fluxes for the whole pne , but naturally any variations of the physical properties in the direction perpendicular to the slit could not be sampled .",
    "an analysis along a ngc6153 fixed slit sampling a ` slice ' of the nebula revealed substantial variations of the physical properties over the slit length . typically , however , the formerly employed @xmath4 2  arcsec - wide slits achieved a rather coarse spatial sampling of @xmath41.6  arcsec per pixel , without sampling the seeing which was of the order of 1  arcsec .",
    "we obtained contiguous 2d spatial coverage of these pne at sub - arcsec resolution with the fibre large array multi element spectrograph ( flames)/giraffe ifu argus .",
    "our main aim was to map out the nebular properties and their variations across large nebular areas and to investigate in detail the existence of any heavy element - rich nebular regions , so as to place constraints on models that have been put forward to explain this astrophysical quandary .",
    "the sample pne were chosen because ngc6153 and ngc7009 exhibit the abundance anomaly problem to a high degree ( with known oxygen adfs of @xmath4 10 and 5 respectively ) and are excellent cases for a detailed study , whereas ngc5882 ( with an adf of @xmath4 2 ) was meant to be our ` control ' target as it represents the majority of galactic nebulae that show a moderate degree of abundance discrepancies .",
    "the paper layout is as follows : the specifications of the observational data set are discussed in section  2 , the data reduction methods are presented in section  3 , and the results in sections  4 and 5 .",
    "the discussion and our conclusions appear in section  6 .",
    "an introduction to this study was presented by tsamis et al .",
    "integral field spectra of ngc5882 , 6153 and 7009 were obtained in service mode between march ",
    "june 2005 in sub - arcsec seeing with the flames / giraffe argus ifu on the 8.2-m vlt ut2/kueyen ( p.i .",
    "tsamis ; eso period 75 ) .",
    "the observing log is presented in table  1 .",
    "all targets were observed in the 396.4  507.8 nm range with the large @xmath11 @xmath1 @xmath12 ifu .",
    "the argus unit is a rectangular array of 22 @xmath1 14 microlenses fed by optical fibres : the @xmath11 @xmath1 @xmath12 array thus projects 308 spaxels on the sky ; the individual spaxel size is @xmath13",
    "@xmath1 @xmath13 .",
    "eight spaxels are reserved for sky subtraction purposes ( from a total of 14 dedicated sky - fibres ) and three currently correspond to broken fibres ( appearing in the second row of a reconstructed argus image ; see fig .",
    "6 ) ; the remainder provide 297 individual spectra per target .",
    "the giraffe spectrograph is equipped with a 2048 @xmath1 4096 eev ccd which has 15@xmath14 m pixels .",
    "two separate wavelength ranges were observed using the lr02 ( 39644567 ) and lr03 ( 45015078 ) grating set - ups .",
    "the respective spectral resolving powers , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 @xmath8/@xmath17 ) , were 10200 and 12000 .",
    "higher spectral resolution hr04 and hr06 spectra ( @xmath15 @xmath16 32500 ) of ngc7009 were also taken with the small @xmath18 @xmath1 @xmath19 ifu and will be published in a separate paper ( walsh et al . in preparation ) .",
    "total exposure times were 6930sec ( ngc5882 ) , 24000sec ( ngc6153 ) , and 4260sec ( ngc7009 ) ; more time was devoted to ngc6153 than to the other two targets since this nebula has the lowest surface brightness , and exhibits the abundance anomaly to a high degree .",
    "the average seeing during the ngc5882 exposures was 0.6 arcsec full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) ; during six out of ten observing blocks of ngc6153 it was better than 0.8 arcsec , while during the remaining four it was @xmath4 0.9 arcsec . during the ngc7009 exposures the seeing ranged between 0.50.8 arcsec .",
    "the sky transparency conditions were generally in the ` clear ' category .",

    "the argus maps have been drawn to scale in all cases . regarding ngc5882 ( fig .  1 ) , which is the nebula with the smallest apparent size of the three , the ifu array was positioned so that the largest part of the bright shell of the pn as well as part of the fainter halo to the south could be covered .",

    "the spectra were reduced at eso garching with the girbldrs pipeline in a process which included bias removal , localization of fibres on the flats , extraction of individual fibres , wavelength calibration and rebinning of the thar lamp exposures , and the full processing of the science frames which resulted in cosmic - ray cleaned , flat - fielded , wavelength - rebinned spectra . in practice",
    "the pipeline actions were initiated by the creation of a master bias frame from the raw biases ( biasmast pipe ) which was subtracted from the science exposures at a later reduction step .",

    "the full master wavelength solution was produced via the extraction , wavelength calibration and rebinning of the raw th - ar exposures ( wcalmast pipe ) .",
    "this was followed by the full processing of the science frames via the extract recipe which , by using the products of the previous steps , subtracts the master bias from the science exposures , takes out an average rejecting any cosmic ray hits , performs the flat - fielding , and finally rebins the extracted spectra in wavelength space . in this way , four to six science frames per observing block were processed together and the resulting frame was corrected for atmospheric extinction within iraf .",
    "the airmass during the exposures was @xmath4 1.1 . when this varied by more than @xmath4 0.1 during the course of a single observing block ( 1 hr ) the frames were extracted individually and were corrected for atmospheric extinction one at a time .",
    "they were subsequently averaged using the imcombine task which performed the cosmic ray rejection as well .",
    "the flux calibration was achieved using exposures of the white dwarf eg  274 using the tasks calibrate and standard .",
    "the flux standard exposures were first individually extracted with girbldrs and the spaxels containing the star were summed up to form a 1d spectrum . the sensitivity function was determined using iraf s sensfunc and this was subsequently applied to the combined science exposures .",
    "the sky subtraction was performed by averaging the spectra recorded by the sky fibres and subtracting this spectrum from that of each spaxel in the ifu .",
    "each of the 14 sky - fibre spectra were examined and the average count in each compared .",
    "four sky fibres had higher counts caused by contamination from the simultaneous calibration lamp ( see below ) , and were not included in the computation of the mean sky spectrum .",
    "custom - made scripts allowed us to convert the row by row stacked , processed ccd spectra to data cubes .",
    "the nebular emission line fluxes were generally measured automatically by fitting gaussian profiles via means of the dedicated program spectre which is based on minuit @xmath32 minimization routines ( james 1998 ) .",
    "this enabled us to retrieve from the spectra associated with each spaxel : the line fluxes , the line fwhm , equivalent widths ( ew ) , line centroids , and the respective errors of these quantities which were propagated in all physical properties derived afterwards .",
    "the same program was used to interactively fit the nebular lines in the vicinity of the pn nuclei , and the absorption lines underneath the hi  lines over the same spaxels . in figs .",
    "4 and 5 giraffe spectra of the pne from single spaxel extractions in the vicinity of 465.0 nm are shown , covering the full o  ii  v1 recombination multiplet , a few n  ii  and c  iii  orls , n  iiibowen fluorescence lines , and he  ii  @xmath84686 .",
    "the lower panels display the observed spectrum ( black line ) , along with the sum of the fitted continuum ( cubic spline fit ) and the individual gaussians ( red line ) .",
    "the upper panels show the errors bars at each point in the spectrum ( red ) and the residuals from the line and continuum fitting ( black ) . in general",
    "the fit residuals are comparable to the error bars .",
    "the fits in figures 45 are for single gaussian line fits to each emission species ; for ngc6153 , 130 spaxels were fitted with double gaussians , since the velocity splitting ( due to nebular expansion ) of 0.6  could be resolved by two lines of fwhm 0.5 . in the case of ngc5882 ,",
    "30 spaxels were fitted by double profiles .",
    "the gaussian fits to the brightest lines in figures 45 show that the detailed profile deviates from a gaussian and in the case of ngc7009 , for example , the very strong he  ii  @xmath84686 line shows residuals in the line wings that are greater than the errors .",
    "since only gaussians were used for fitting , without a detailed line profile describing the grating scattering line wings , these line wing features were not fitted in detail .",
    "neglect of these faint features constitutes a loss of less than one per cent to the line flux , and it was considered that a consistent line profile shape for all lines ( i.e. gaussian ) was of highest priority for comparison of relative line fluxes ( on which plasma conditions and abundance determinations that are central to this analysis depend ) . in general ,",
    "the spectral resolution achieved was sufficient to resolve any known blends that affect heavy element orls in lower resolution spectra .",
    "extra care was taken to interactively fit any remaining blended lines and to also fit double gaussian profiles in cases where the spectral resolution was high enough to resolve the expansion of the nebula ( e.g. in the case of ngc6153 ) .",
    "an unforeseen issue arose due to the use of the ` simultaneous calibration lamp ' during the science exposures .",
    "use of this device is not really necessary for spectrophotometric work and it was left on unintentionally during the preparation of phase ii .",
    "the lamp introduced an additive contamination pattern ( francesca primas , private communication ) on certain spaxels of the array ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , which showed up as a mix of broad and narrow features .",
    "all these features are light scattered from fibre - to - fibre and the broad features are presumably the scattering wings of strong lines in the comparison lamp spectrum . since the pn line emission covered the whole of the ifu area for all three nebulae , there was no opportunity with the current data to subtract pn emission - free spaxel spectra in order to remove the contamination pattern .",
    "instead the contaminated spectra were interactively fitted by following the continuum in detail and any spurious narrower ` lines ' were fitted by additional gaussians .",
    "the results were satisfactory , although of course the fit errors on the nebular line fluxes were increased at those spaxels .",
    "the spectra of ngc6153 , which is the nebula with the lowest surface brightness , were most affected and 40 spaxels were interactively fitted and decontaminated in the manner described above .    likewise , a scattered light feature appeared towards the last few ccd columns ( long wavelengths ) at the top - right corner of the stacked array .",
    "this was due to a residual ccd signal , which is a known cosmetic defect of the chip .",
    "the signal is additive ( in excess of the bias ) and , as it affected only certain spaxels in the reconstructed argus image , it was fitted with a low - order polynomial and subtracted out .",
    "finally , apart from the three fibres which were broken during eso period 75 , the fibre corresponding to spaxel ( 4 , 4 ) of the reconstructed array is problematic in that it exhibits an anomalous spike in its signal , which often affected spaxels ( 3 , 4 ) and ( 5 , 4 ) too  the respective spectra were therefore handled accordingly and generally suffer from large uncertainties .",
    "after the line fluxes had been measured , the reconstructed argus data cubes were corrected for interstellar extinction using the @xmath33(h@xmath20 ) extinction maps derived from a comparison of the observed to the predicted h@xmath34/h@xmath20  line ratio using its case b value from storey & hummer ( 1995 ) .",
    "the galactic extinction law of howarth ( 1983 ) with a ratio of total to selective extinction ( @xmath35 ) of 3.1 was used . since the lr02 and lr03 spectra , containing the h@xmath34 and h@xmath20 lines respectively , were taken in different exposures , and often on different nights , then it was necessary to tie the fluxes together in order to determine the extinction of the maps from the h@xmath34 to h@xmath20 ratio .",
    "this comparison was performed by taking the total flux from the h@xmath34 and h@xmath20 maps and comparing the ratio with that observed from long - slit studies .",
    "for ngc5882 the absolute value of the ratio was taken as 0.410 from the scanned - slit ( mean over the whole pn ) data of tsamis et al .",
    "( 2003b ) ; for ngc6153 , the ratio for the whole nebula ( 0.333 ) was taken from liu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; for ngc7009 , the ratio of 0.443 for a value of @xmath33(h@xmath20 ) @xmath16 0.20 was adopted ( cf .",
    "it should be noted that the ifu area does not exactly correspond to the comparison regions from the long - slit data , so the absolute extinction , and hence dereddened line ratios can be systematically offset .",
    "to gain an idea of the photometric quality of the observations , the lr02 and lr03 maps had to be corrected by 47 , 5 and 5 per cent for ngc5882 , 6153 and 7009 respectively .",
    "potential shifts between the lr02 and lr03 maps , caused either by a slightly different pointing between the observations ( although note that the lr02 and lr03 setting were always taken in pairs ; table  1 ) and/or the changing differential atmospheric extinction between the settings , were determined by cross - correlation of features in the h@xmath34 and h@xmath20 maps .",
    "for ngc5882 a shift of 0.25 spaxels in the ifu x - direction could be clearly detected ( this pn has the sharpest spatial features as it was observed under @xmath4 0.6 arcsec seeing ) .",

    "a strong inverse correlation between the cel - based o@xmath3/h@xmath52  abundances and @xmath47([o  iii ] ) is established for all three sources .",
    "the o@xmath3/h@xmath52  cel abundance decreases by factors of approximately 2.0 , 1.5 and 1.3 over @xmath60@xmath47 s of @xmath4 @xmath551600 , @xmath551100 and @xmath55700k in ngc6153 , 7009 , and 5882 respectively ( figs .  15d , 17a , 18a ) .",
    "the exponential dependence of cel - based abundances on the adopted electron temperature ( the boltzmann factor ) mathematically suppresses most of the scatter in o@xmath3/h@xmath52  induced by errors in the @xmath47([o  iii ] ) determination , thus strengthening the correlation .",
    "however , the correlation mostly reflects a physical process since the variation of temperature with position is not random ( see ngc6153 , but also ngc7009 where regions closer to the nucleus have a higher mean temperature ) , and @xmath47([o  iii ] ) shows a high degree of correlation with other essentially independent quantities such as the c@xmath3/h@xmath52  and o@xmath3/h@xmath52  orl abundances .",
    "a physical correlation is expected as well , since [ o  iii ]  is a dominant coolant of the gas : where the concentration of o@xmath3  is lower , @xmath47([o  iii ] ) will tend to be higher .",
    "this may be due to a real variation of the o / h abundance or to a variation of the o@xmath3/o ionization fraction . assuming a constant o / h , the higher forbidden - line temperature in the inner nebular regions can be qualitatively understood if part of the o@xmath3  ionic component shifts into o@xmath61 ; this is a likely possibility since o@xmath61 must coexist with he@xmath3(based on ionization stratification considerations ) , and the o@xmath3/h@xmath52  cel abundance inversely correlates with he@xmath3/he ( figs .  16f , 17h , 18h ) .",
    "along the same lines , contrasting ngc6153 with ngc5882 , the observed range of @xmath47([o  iii ] ) across the respective ifu regions is larger where the he@xmath3zone is more prominent ( i.e. , in the former rather than in the latter nebula ) .",
    "the large opacity of he@xmath52  and the relatively large average energy of the corresponding photoelectrons both contribute to further heat the high - ionization region . that the inner nebula electron temperature can be explained in this way should await quantitative analysis by means of photoionization models tailored to these observations .",
    "extra heating can be provided by the photoelectric effect on small dust grains that may populate the vicinity of the central stars ( see section  6 ) .",
    "the variety of potential heat sources and the associated uncertainties can make potential spatial variations of o / h in the gas phase that emits [ o  iii ]  @xmath84959 difficult to ascertain .",
    "one intriguing aspect is the fact that @xmath47([o  iii ] ) continues to decrease outwards in ngc6153 , even in regions where he@xmath3  and o@xmath61 should in principle be minor species .",
    "it may be that he@xmath3  can survive relatively farther out from the nucleus than expected as the gas ` porosity ' induced by density fluctuations can blur out the theoretical ion stratification .",
    "the second fundamental piece of information from this analysis is the clear positive correlation of the c@xmath3/h@xmath52  and o@xmath3/h@xmath52  orl abundances _ versus _",
    "@xmath47([o  iii ] ) for all three targets  even for the low adf ` control ' ngc5882 .",
    "throughout the ifu region of ngc6153 , for instance , these abundances increase by a factor of @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "15e  f ) from the outer to the inner nebula , so that the corresponding increase in the o@xmath3  adf is a factor of @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "this is paradoxical in that orls should _ a priori _ be enhanced in low @xmath47  conditions ( due to their emissivities obeying an inverse power law with electron temperature ) .",
    "if a sizeable fraction of the ( optical ) [ o  iii ]  flux were to arise from the same parcel of gas emitting a sizeable fraction of orl flux , then part of the [ o  iii ]  emission would necessarily be produced at relatively low electron temperatures and the ( observed ) average @xmath47([o  iii ] ) would be lower ( _ not higher _ ) , where orl emission is strongest . _",
    "thus , this paradox demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that heavy element cels and orls must essentially arise from unrelated gas components . _    the ` dual abundance ' picture of two distinct components of highly ionized gas at very different temperatures can solve the paradox , but the only known way to maintain a strongly photoionized gas at low @xmath47  is thermostasis by fine - structure ( fs ) infrared lines .",
    "this mechanism can only be effective for sufficiently large heavy - element abundances ( and sufficiently low electron densities so that the low critical density fs lines are not quenched ) .",
    "this interpretation of the data is qualitatively coherent since cool hydrogen - deficient ionized gas propitiously emits orls .",
    "therefore , at another quantitative level ( separate from orls ) , an essential check can be provided by the 2d spatial distribution of infrared fs line emission ; this should be tractable by means of _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "observations and future _ herschel _ surveys .",
    "we have presented the first detailed analysis of integral field unit spectrophotometry of three galactic pne ( ngc 5882 , 6153 , and 7009 ) taken with the 8.2-m vlt and demonstrated the superb capability of flames argus data for the accurate mapping of the physical properties of nebulae .",
    "spatially resolved maps of 11.5@xmath29 @xmath1 7.2@xmath29 areas of the pne with 0.52@xmath57 arcsec@xmath57 spaxels were made in the light of [ o  iii ]  @xmath84959 and [ ne  iii]@xmath83967 lines , and the h@xmath20  @xmath84861 , he  i  @xmath84471 , he  ii@xmath84686 , c  ii  @xmath84267 , o  ii  @xmath84089 and @xmath84649 recombination lines .",

    "maps of the resulting o@xmath3  abundance discrepancy factor were made .",
    "the o@xmath3adf varies between the targets and across the argus field of view in each case . in ngc6153 and ngc7009 the o@xmath3  adf and the c@xmath3",
    "orl abundance show distinct spikes at or near the nucleus . in ngc7009",
    "these quantities further peak at positions coinciding with the high excitation boundary between the inner nebular shell and the outer envelope ; this feature is well registered on both the argus maps and the _ hst _ wfpc2 image . in ngc5882 , where the s / n ratio of o  ii  orls is lower , the o@xmath3adf derived from the @xmath84089/@xmath84959 diagnostics also peaks at the position of the central star .    in all cases these local maxima",
    "are observed over about two spaxels ( @xmath41  arcsec ) and are therefore at the limit of our spatial resolution .",
    "this means that the hypothetical structures associated with the hydrogen - poor plasma should have physical dimensions of @xmath62 1000 astronomical units ( a.u . ) , assuming a typical pn distance of the order of 1kpc .",
    "correlations between the o@xmath3  adf and the ionization state of the gas as gauged by the he@xmath3/he ionization fraction were established for ngc6153 and 7009 ; likewise strong correlations of the o@xmath3  adf and the c@xmath3/h@xmath52  and o@xmath3/h@xmath52  orl abundances _ versus _ the forbidden line electron temperature were established for these nebulae ( for ngc5882 these correlations were weaker but in the same direction ) .",
    "this constitutes new evidence that the ` metallic ' orls in these pne are somehow associated with highly ionized plasma , and that heavy element orls and cels arise from largely unrelated parcels of gas , in accordance with dual - abundance photoionization models ( pquignot et al .",
    "we argue that this hydrogen - deficient , highly ionized plasma may well ( i ) have been recently ejected from the nucleus in the form of clumped gas , or ( ii ) be part of circumstellar material very close to the star in the form of a disk - torus structure ( based on the spatial correlation of the diagnostics with the position of the central star ) , or equally that ( iii ) it originates from high excitation gas currently being photoevaporated from milli - pc scale neutral condensations embedded in the nebulae at the limit of our spatial resolution .    in case ( i ) , _ the physical origin of the enhanced heavy - element orl emission could be an ensemble of hydrogen - poor clumps analogous to the h - poor knots observed in the class of nebulae , such as abell 30 or abell 58 _",

    "2007 ) . in this context",
    ", the range of adfs found amongst our targets could reflect an evolutionary effect with h - poor zones becoming progressively more readily observed as the density and temperature contrast between them and the ambient expanding nebula increases over time .",
    "one should recall that ngc5882 is positioned in the lower end of the ` adf sequence ' established from the long - slit surveys according to which dense , compact and lower ionization pne exhibit smaller integrated abundance discrepancies than more diffuse , larger and higher ionization nebulae . ngc6153 and 7009 , on the other hand , appear to be in a more advanced stage of the ` adf evolution ' ( tsamis et al .",
    "2004 ; liu et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in case ( ii ) , _ the hydrogen - deficient gas could arise from circumstellar structures _ such as those recently discovered by vlt interferometric observations in association with j - type c - stars ( iras 18006 - 3213  deroo et al",
    ". 2007a ) , post - agb stars ( v390 vel  deroo et al .",
    "2007b ) and pne ( mz3  chesneau et al .",
    "these toroidal structures have estimated radii of @xmath62 1000 a.u .",
    "and there is evidence that they contain large amounts of silicate dust .",
    "the inference about their chemistry is important as the c / o orl abundance ratio derived for our pn sample is lower than unity ; this means that an association of the hydrogen - poor , o - rich gas with silicate - based ( i.e. oxygen - rich ) dust is not unlikely ( see below ) .    in case ( iii )",
    "_ the h - poor plasma could originate in evaporating dusty ` cometary knots ' analogous to those in the helix nebula _",
    "( ngc7293 ; e.g. meaburn et al .",
    "1992 ) immersed in high ionization nebular zones both near ( ngc5882 , 6153 , 7009 ) and farther out ( ngc7009 ) from the stars .",
    "the helix globules however are rich in molecular hydrogen ( meixner et al . 2005 ) and this hypothesis would require a mechanism for the efficient removal of hydrogen and/or the chemical differentiation of the evaporated gas for the spectroscopic signature of h - poor plasma to be observed .",
    "also , in the helix nebula at least , there is no evidence of globules inside the high ionization he  ii  zone or of he  ii  emission from the observed globules , and these features are mostly associated with emission from lower ionization species ( odell et al .",
    "2002 ; odell , henney and ferland 2007 ) ; in contrast , as we have shown , the h - poor plasma in our pne is associated with he  ii  emission . on the other hand",
    ", this _ does not _ preclude that ` molecular ' globules can be effectively destroyed in the inner regions of pne whilst leaving pockets of h - poor plasma behind .",
    "this hypothesis can clearly be put to the test with observations of the type presented in this work .",
    "we have presented evidence that , in the central regions of ngc6153 , the c@xmath3orl abundance , the he@xmath3/he ionization fraction and the o@xmath3  adf are weakly correlated with the extinction constant .",
    "there is marginal evidence that this may hold for the inner parts of ngc7009 as well .",
    "this correlation , if real , could corroborate either the ` dusty clump evaporation ' scenario or the ` dusty disk ' scenario for the origin of the hydrogen - deficient gas .",
    "dust - rich regions can contribute to the heating of their plasma environs via photoelectric gas heating ( e.g. dopita & sutherland 2000 ; stasiska & szczerba 2001 ; weingartner , draine and barr 2006 ) and to the metal enrichment of the gas via grain destruction , thus bringing about this correlation . according to dopita &",
    "sutherland dust grain photoelectric heating is more effective in regions with a population of small grains , it increases with increasing grain metallicity , and is more important in highly ionized regions .",
    "this effect could also play a role in the observed rise of @xmath47([o  iii ] ) in the inner ngc6153 regions ( in parallel to usual photoionization which can also enhance the electron temperature in the he@xmath3  zone ) , although coupled dust / plasma models would be needed to ascertain and quantify this .",
    "alternatively , since the theoretical h@xmath34/h@xmath20  line ratio decreases with decreasing electron temperature ( storey & hummer 1995 ) , and since the extinction constant ( based on h@xmath34/h@xmath20 ) was computed here adopting @xmath47([o  iii ] ) , the positive correlation of @xmath33(h@xmath20 ) with the adf may be indicative of the fact that hilines in pne partly arise from cool gas which emits most of the heavy element orls , in accordance with dual - abundance models .",
    "relatively weak correlations between the o@xmath3  adf and the o@xmath3/h@xmath52 , c@xmath3/h@xmath52orl abundances _ versus _ the he / h ratio in ngc6153 and ( in the inner regions ) of ngc7009 have been established .",
    "this result , which should be backed up by further studies , constitutes new observational evidence that corroborates the predictions of the dual - abundance pn models of pquignot et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) . in those models ,",
    "the heavy element - rich ( h - poor ) gas component , which is responsible for the bulk of the heavy element orl emission , is also helium - rich and as such it contributes non - negligibly to the emissivity of the helium orls .",
    "when this effect is not accounted for , as in empirical methods like the one we have used in this work , there is an insidious bias towards overestimating the helium to hydrogen abundance ratio .",
    "based on our results it is therefore clear that total he / h abundances of pne as traditionally determined from empirical methods , and which assume chemical uniformity of the plasma , will be systematically overestimated .",
    "again detailed modelling in the context of a chemically inhomogeneous nebula is needed to remove this bias . with respect to helium",
    "it should be noted that , in contrast to he@xmath3 , he@xmath52  is not perturbed by h - poor material , since nebular regions with high he@xmath3/h@xmath52  give the same ( he@xmath52  @xmath55 he@xmath3)/h ratio as regions with low he@xmath52/h@xmath52 .    in conclusion ,",
    "our detailed ifs analysis of a few suitable objects has allowed us to identify important new elements of the still incomplete puzzle of planetary nebula astrophysics , and we have put forward testable proposals for the likely nature of some of the missing pieces . furthermore , this study has underlined a number of clear requirements that a detailed solution to the ` orl vs. cel ' problem should meet , if it were to be successful .",

    "<S> the occurrence of the abundance discrepancy problem , pertaining to oxygen , was investigated by mapping the ratio of orl / cel abundances for o@xmath3  ( the _ abundance discrepancy factor _ ; adf ) across the face of the pne . </S>",
    "<S> the adf varies between targets and also with position within the targets , attaining values of @xmath4 40 in the case of ngc6153 and @xmath4 30 in the case of ngc7009 . </S>",
    "<S> correlations of the adf with geometric distance from the central star and plasma surface brightness ( for ngc6153 ) , as well as with [ o  iii ]  electron temperature , plasma ionization state and other physical properties of the targets are established . </S>",
    "<S> very small values of the temperature fluctuation parameter in the plane of the sky , @xmath5(o@xmath3 ) , are found in all cases .    </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that these results provide further evidence for the existence in run - of - the - mill pne of a distinct nebular component consisting of hydrogen - deficient , super - metal - rich plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the zones containing this posited component appear as undulations in the c  ii  and o  ii  orl abundance diagnostics of about 2 spatial pixels across , and so any associated structures should have physical sizes of less than @xmath4 1000 astronomical units . regarding the origin of the inferred zones , we propose that circumstellar disks , abell 30-type knots , or helix - type cometary globules may be involved . </S>",
