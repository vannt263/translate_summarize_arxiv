    "the research on quantum many - body system is an actual topic in physics .",
    "experiments on mesoscopic quantum systems together with updated numerical techniques for quantum many - body theory has produced and puts light on questions related to fundaments of quantum many - body physics and the relationship between microphysics and thermodynamics @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", we still need analytical theory to clarify questions which answers can not be given with a non analytical theories . in this way",
    "the algebraic formulation of bethe ansatz together with quantum inverse scattering method has been an important tool to propose new theoretical integrable models @xcite .",
    "they can be used to explain some experimental features and also to propose new experiments to investigate new physical phenomena in a mesoscopic scale .    for bosonic systems",
    "an important theoretical and integrable model is the two site bose - hubbard model ( _ canonical josephson hamiltonian _ ) @xcite .",
    "the model has been used to understand tunneling phenomena and it explains the qualitative experimental behaviour of bose - einstein condensates in a double well potential system @xcite . in recent literature models with more number of modes have been proposed .",
    "non integrable models with three modes @xcite , four modes @xcite and five modes @xcite have appeared in the literature in the last decades .",
    "however , integrable versions for the above models and even with more number of modes are welcomed because they could give new insights to broad our understanding in the quantum integrability area and consequently they could yield the possibilities to investigate new and opened questions related to the fundamental physics where thermodynamics effects are not taking into account .",
    "for example , in the reference @xcite was speculated that coherent backscattering in ultracold bosonic atoms might act as some sort of precursor to many - body localization .",
    "however , the authors pointed out that more research appears to be useful in order to elucidate those speculative questions . in reference",
    "@xcite was proposed and solved a simple double - well model which incorporates many key ingredients of the disordered bose - hubbard model .",
    "it is believed that the minimal model could be a simple theoretical paradigm for understanding the details of the full disordered interacting quantum phase diagram . that way ,",
    "going beyond the two modes models , it allows us to take into account new effects , like the long - range effect , opening the possibility to do new theoretical investigations needed for the full understanding of the disordered bose - hubbard model . on the other hand side , in order to helping to elucidate the above questions , in the last year it was presented an integrable version for a model with four modes @xcite and more recently a generalized integrable version for a multi - mode models were presented in the references @xcite opening a great opportunity to do new theoretical investigations .    in this work",
    "we are interested to presenting the simplest and integrable model with three modes which can be used as a toy model for understanding quantum control devices operation .",
    "the model we show here is a particular case of a more general integrable model @xcite belonging to the family of integrable models presented in the references @xcite .",
    "we believe the model we are presenting here can be useful to put light on subjects related to _ atomtronic _ @xcite and also in quantum manipulation via external fields @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath0 we present the integrable model and its physical meaning .",
    "section @xmath1 is devoted to the classical analysis for the equivalent quantum model where the hamilton s equations , the threshold of discontinuous phase transition and the classical dynamics are presented . in section @xmath2 ,",
    "the quantum dynamics is carried out . in section @xmath3",
    "is devoted for our discussions and overview and finally in section @xmath4 is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "recently the integrable hamiltonian for three aligned well was presented in the reference @xcite and it takes the following hamiltonian    @xmath5    where the coupling @xmath6 is the intra - well and inter - well interaction between bosons , @xmath7 is the external potential and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is the constant couplings for the tunneling between the wells .",
    "there in the reference @xcite it was shown that there are three independent conserved quantities @xmath10 , @xmath11 , the energy @xmath12 and also an important dependent conserved quantity @xmath13 , the total number of bosons in the system . for each fixed value of @xmath14 ,",
    "the dimension @xmath15 of hilbert space associated to the model is given by @xmath16 .",
    "in this paper we will focus on a particular case of the above hamiltonian . setting @xmath17",
    "then the hamiltonian takes the simple form    @xmath18    up to an irrelevant constant @xmath19 .",
    "we observe that the independent conserved quantities now take the simple form @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the above model is basically a model with two wells ( well @xmath22 and well @xmath0 ) interacting with a third well ( well @xmath1 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] we show a schematic representation for the model .    as the population in the wells @xmath22 and @xmath0",
    "must be conserved and there is tunneling between them , we expect that flow of bosons between wells @xmath22 and @xmath0 can be controlled by the population of the well @xmath1 which is also a conserved quantity . in order to do a parallel with the well - known two site bose - hubbard model @xcite , we first performe the coupling mapping @xmath23 and defining @xmath24 where @xmath7 is the habitual external potential .",
    "so we have now the hamiltonian    @xmath25    up to irrelevant constant @xmath26 .",
    "now we observe that @xmath27 works like an _ effective external potential _ that depends on the population in the well @xmath1 which turns on the interwell interactions between wells @xmath22-@xmath1 and wells @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "physically the above model , as the apparent similarity with the two well bose - hubbard model , has a different physical interpretation .",
    "here we have a three well model where a two well bose - hubbard model ( well @xmath22 and well @xmath0 with the tunneling possibility between them ) interacting with a third one ( well @xmath1 ) without the possibility of tunneling between them , that is no tunneling between wells @xmath22-@xmath1 and wells @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "later we will see that the presence of these interwell interactions will always _ induce _ the localization in the dynamics .    before go ahead in the quantum analysis",
    ", firstly we take a look in the classical analogue of the model ( [ h2n2 ] ) .",
    "doing @xmath28 and also the change of variables @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the _ population imbalance _ between wells @xmath22 and @xmath0 and @xmath31 is the phase difference .",
    "so the classical analogue of the model above is    @xmath32    with the identification @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the _ relative population _ between well @xmath1 and wells @xmath22-@xmath0 .",
    "the classical dynamics can be computed through _",
    "hamilton s equations _    @xmath36      defining @xmath37 and @xmath38 and using the conservation of energy , then for any initial condition we have    @xmath39    in what follows we consider only the initial state @xmath40 . now",
    "the equation ( [ ehg ] ) @xmath41   \\label{thr}\\ ] ] must be holded . from this equation",
    "is possible to obtain the threshold couplings for the population imbalance dynamics between wells @xmath22-@xmath0 .",
    "firstly , we will analyse the behavior of the function @xmath42 in the allowed physical interval . in fig.[fig1 ] clearly the dynamics of the system can be localized ( @xmath43 $ ] ) or delocalized ( @xmath44 $ ] ) , with @xmath45 .    to find the relationship between the parameters for the threshold curve",
    ", we consider @xmath46 , so the above equation becomes @xmath47 as the straight line @xmath48 is tangent to the curve @xmath49 in some point @xmath50 , then we have that @xmath51 .",
    "now doing @xmath52 we find the threshold coupling point , with the coordinates @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as a parametric equations of @xmath50 : @xmath55 the above equations gives @xmath56 .",
    "clearly there is a minimum point for @xmath57 ( maximum point for @xmath58 ) in the threshold curve .",
    "the minimal ( maximal ) point has coordinates given by @xmath59 by using eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) we can trace out the threshold curve . these results together with the some solutions of eq .",
    "( [ zaa ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "as there is a symmetry in the diagram of parameter , hereafter we just consider the case @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath60 , the threshold curve separates the diagram of parameters in two regions :    * region i : for @xmath61 , the dynamics between wells @xmath22-@xmath0 is localized . *",
    "region ii : for @xmath62 : the dynanics between wells @xmath22-@xmath0 is delocalized ;    it is worth to highlight for the case @xmath60 that the passing through the region i to the region ii is abrupt configuring the threshold in the classical dynamics . on the other hand side , for @xmath63",
    ", there is not a threshold and the classical dynamics changes smoothly .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - abrupt ] .     as a function of @xmath64 , for @xmath65 ( solid black line ) , @xmath66 ( dashed red line ) , @xmath67 ( dotted - dashed blue line ) and @xmath68 ( dotted green line ) .",

    "the dashed line is @xmath72.,width=377,height=188 ]      integrating the above hamilton s equations we can see how the classical system is evolving .",
    "recall that @xmath73 .",
    "thus , if the system is initially in the delocalized dynamics regime ( region ii ) with @xmath74 and @xmath75 , by increasing the relative population @xmath76 , the system will eventually cross the threshold curve to get into the region i and then the dynamics between wells 1 - 2 will be localized . in the fig . [ evol1 ]",
    "we plot the time evolution for @xmath30 showing the dependence of the parameter @xmath76 .     for two threshold points : above is for the point @xmath77 and below is for the point @xmath78 . on the left side",
    "is for @xmath79 ( delocalized region ) and on the right is @xmath80 ( localized region ) . on top",
    "the solid line is for @xmath81 and the dashed line is for @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "on botton the solid line is for @xmath84 and the dashed line is for @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) . for the both cases we are using the initial state @xmath87,@xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91.,width=377,height=188 ]    clearly from fig .",
    "[ evol1 ] there is a threshold in the classical dynamics when we move from one region to another by varying the parameter @xmath92 ( solid black line ) .",
    "it is worth noting from fig .",
    "[ evol1 ] that the increasing of @xmath76 induces always localization on the classical dynamics .",
    "the important issue here is to understand that if the system is in a delocalized dynamics regime ( region ii ) there is a threshold for relative population ( @xmath93 ) which separates again the dynamics in delocalized and localized regimes .",
    "however if the system is in localized dynamics regime ( region i ) the dynamics smoothly becomes more localized by increasing the relative population in well @xmath1 ( dashed red line ) .",
    "next we look if these behaviors are also present in the quantum dynamics of the model .",
    "using the standard procedure now we compute the time evolution of the expectation value of the population imbalance between wells @xmath22-@xmath0 using the expression @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the temporal evolution operator and @xmath97 represents the initial state in fock space .",
    "recall that for fixed value of total number of bosons @xmath14 , the hilbert space associated to the hamiltonian ( [ h2n2 ] ) has dimension @xmath16 . as @xmath21 is conserved , the hamiltonian can be written in block - diagonal form for appropriated choice of the basis , where each eigenvalue of @xmath98 gives the dimension of each block by @xmath99 .",
    "the total number of blocks is @xmath100 , such that @xmath101 . if one boson is added in the well @xmath1 , then the dimension of hamiltonian is given by @xmath102 and the dimension of block associated to the eigenvalue @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , for initial state @xmath105 the quantum dynamics is just governed by the block with fixed dimension @xmath106 for any @xmath107 .    to start our discussion , firstly",

    "[ qdt ] with the solid black line on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ qdt ] ) .",
    "we highlight that if the system is in the delocalized regime and around the threshold , the dynamics can be driven abruptly from one regime to the another just increasing or decreasing the population in well @xmath1 .",
    "this opens the possibility to induce localization or delocalization in the dynamics between wells 1 - 2 just controlling the population in well @xmath1 ( external control ) .",
    "we believe that this property can be useful to explain quantum devices where the switching scheme is needed .",
    "the model presented above is the simplest model we can build using three modes and moreover it is integrable in the sense of bethe ansatz . however , as the apparent simplicity , we believe that this model may be feasible experimentally . taking into account the extent of the interwell interaction is greater than the range required for tunneling , the results obtained from the model could be verifyed in a proposed experiment using two subtly different possible experimental realization leading to the same physical interpretation :    * spatially bringing closer the well @xmath22 and well @xmath0 allowing tunneling between them and then leaving well @xmath1 at a fixed distance such the tunneling is not allowed but the interwell interactions among them are turned on . by increasing or decreasing the population in well @xmath1 will change the intensity of the interwell interactions between wells , so in this way we can have control of population imbalance between the wells @xmath22-@xmath0 at some distance . *",
    "keeping the population in well @xmath1 fixed and spatially bringing it closer at the well @xmath22 and well @xmath0 and separating apart after an interval of time .    clearly from our previous theoretical results the variation of the population in well @xmath1 or analogously the approximation of the well @xmath1 keeping fixed its population close to the wells @xmath22-@xmath0 can be seen as a variation of the intensity of an external field . by the way quantum manipulation via external field",
    "is a long - standing research area in physics and chemistry @xcite .",
    "a study of coherent control of tunneling for an ultracold atoms can be found in the references @xcite .    on the other hand side ,",
    "the proposed theoretical model can be seen as the simplest and useful model for modeling quantum devices which needs some control at a distance by using an external field / potential . in this way",
    "the model presented here can be useful in _ atomtronic _ area @xcite since it can mimic a _ field effect transistor_. taking into account the analogy with the electronic transistor , the well @xmath22 behaves like the _ source _ , the well @xmath0 behaves like the _ drain _ and the well @xmath1 behaves like the _ gate_. we have demonstrated that tunneling of a large fraction of bosons from well @xmath22 to well @xmath0 can be controlled by small fraction of bosons put into the well @xmath1 , without passing through it . in the absence or very small population in well @xmath1 the device is switched on resulting into the strong flux of bosons from well @xmath22 ( the source ) into the well @xmath0 ( the drain ) . increasing the population in the well @xmath1 the flux of bosons from well @xmath22 to",
    "well @xmath0 becomes smaller and the device starts to be switched off .",

    "here we are using @xmath134 and @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath143.,width=377,height=188 ]    moreover , the proposed model allows us also go further and we can envisioning another interesting scenario .",
    "we can induce a change of quantum phase transition by using an external field by controlling the distance between two parallel bidimensional chains .",
    "for example , if we are imagining bosons weakly interacting loaded in a bidimensional chain where bosons are in a delocalized dynamics regime with tunneling allowed just on the plane .",
    "if another similar bidimensional chain is putting parallel nearby the former one , then taking in account that tunneling between plane is prohibited the change of quantum phase can be induced by changing the interplane distance .",
    "that way , we can go from the superfluid - like phase to insulator - like phase just manipulating the interplane separation between bidimensional planes .",
    "our studies are just in the beginning of the investigations and new results will be published somewhere .",
    "in summary , in this work we presented the simplest model we can build using three modes and moreover it is integrable in the sense of bethe ansatz .",
    "after , the semiclassical analysis for the model was carried out .",
    "the hamilton s equations , the diagram of coupling parameters and the classical dynamics were presented .",
    "posteriorly the quantum dynamics of the model was presented and we show that the flow of bosons between the wells @xmath22-@xmath0 can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the population in the well @xmath1 leading to the conclusions that a small population put into well @xmath1 , relative with population in well @xmath22 and well @xmath0 , generates an effective control of population imbalance between wells @xmath22-@xmath0 .",
    "later we discussed the experimental feasibility of model suggesting an experiment without taking into account the technicality experimental . in the end , we conclude that the proposed model can be very useful to understand quantum devices which needs a quantum control in its operation , for example , in _ atomtronic _ @xcite and also in quantum manipulation via external field @xcite .",

    "<S> in this work we show the simplest and integrable model for bose - einstein condensates loaded in a triple well potential where the tunneling between two wells can be controlled by the other well showing a behavior similar to an electronic field effect transistor . using a classical analysis , the hamilton s equation </S>",
    "<S> are obtained , a threshold indicating a discontinuous phase transition is presented and the classical dynamics is computed . </S>",
    "<S> then , the quantum dynamics is investigated using direct diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> we find well agreement in both these analysis . </S>",
    "<S> based on our results , the switching scheme for tunneling is shown and the experimental feasibility is discussed . </S>"
