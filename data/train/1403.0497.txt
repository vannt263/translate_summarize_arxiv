    "while this model undoubtedly captures the essential physics correctly in a qualitative way , it has recently been shown@xcite that a quantitatively correct description of the kondo physics of dilute fe impurities in au or ag requires a fully screened kondo model involving three channels and a spin-@xmath5 impurity .",
    "this conclusion was based on a comparison of temperature and magnetic field dependent transport measurements@xcite to theoretical predictions for fully screened kondo models with channel number @xmath0 and local spin @xmath6 related by @xmath7 , with @xmath8 yielding much better agreement than @xmath9 or 2 .    the theoretical results in ref .",

    "the technology for implementing non - abelian symmetries with @xmath13 in nrg calculations has been developed only recently.@xcite given the complexity of such calculations , it is desirable to benchmark their quality by comparing their predictions to exact results .",
    "the motivation for the present paper was to perform such a comparison for the low - energy fermi - liquid behavior of fully screened kondo models , as elaborated upon below .",
    "all fully screened kondo models feature a ground state in which the impurity spin is screened by the conduction electrons into a spin singlet .",
    "the low - energy behavior of these models can be described by a phenomenological fermi - liquid theory ( flt ) formulated in terms of the phase shift experienced by conduction electrons that scatter elastically off the screened singlet .",
    "such a description was first devised for the simplest case of @xmath9 by nozires@xcite in 1974 , and generalized to the case of arbitrary @xmath0 by nozires and blandin ( nb)@xcite in 1980 .",
    "their results were confirmed and elaborated by various authors and methods , including nrg,@xcite field - theoretic calculations,@xcite the bethe ansatz,@xcite conformal field theory ( cft),@xcite renormalized perturbation theory,@xcite and reformulations@xcite and generalizations@xcite of nozires approach in the context of kondo quantum dots .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on three particular fermi - liquid coefficients , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , characterizing the leading dependence of the resistivity on magnetic field ( @xmath14 ) and temperature ( @xmath15 ) , and the curvature of the equilibrium kondo resonance as function of excitation energy @xmath16 ) , respectively .",

    "[ sec : fermi - liquid ] implicitly assumes that the model is considered in the so - called scaling limit , in which the ratio of kondo temperature to bandwidth vanishes , @xmath192 . in this limit ,",
    "physical quantities such as @xmath193 are universal scaling functions , which depend on their arguments only in the combinations @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "since the shape of such a scaling function , say @xmath196 plotted versus @xmath194 , is universal , i.e.  independent of the bare parameters ( coupling @xmath24 and bandwidth @xmath197 ) used to calculate it , curves generated by different combinations of bare parameters can all be made to collapse onto each other by suitably adjusting the parameter @xmath44 for each . in the same sense the fermi - liquid parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , being taylor - coefficients of universal curves , are universal , too .",
    "one common way to achieve a scaling collapse , popular particularly in experimental studies , is to identify the kondo temperature with the field @xmath198 or temperature @xmath199 at which the impurity contribution to the resisitivity has decreased to half its unitary value , @xmath200 however , this is approach is not suitable for the purpose of extracting fermi - liquid coefficients , for which @xmath44 has to be defined in terms of ( analytically accessible ) low - energy properties characteristic of the strong - coupling fixed point . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fermi - liquid ] we have therefore adopted nozires definition of @xmath44 in terms of the leading energy dependence of the phase shift @xmath201 [ eq.([eq : gp - phase - shift - a - la - nb ] ) ] , implying that it can be expressed in terms of @xmath50 , of the local static spin susceptibility at zero temperature [ eq.([eq : friedel - magnetization ] ) ] . in the scaling limit , this definition of @xmath44 matches @xmath198 or @xmath199 up to prefactors , i.e.  @xmath202 and @xmath203 are universal , @xmath0-dependent numerical constants , independent of the model s bare parameters .    in numerical work , however , the scaling limit is never fully realized , since the bandwidth is always finite .",
    "it may thus happen that a scaling collapse expected analytically is not found when the corresponding curves are calculated numerically .",
    "for example , if the kondo temperature is defined , as seems natural , in terms of a purely local susceptibility , @xmath204 , involving only the response of the local spin to a local field , @xmath205 then curves expected to show a scaling collapse actually do not collapse onto each other , as pointed out recently in ref .",

    "a corresponding susceptibility defined in terms of the response of the system s _ total _ spin to a local field should be used : @xmath206 the superscript fs stands for `` friedel sum rule '' , to highlight the fact that using this rule to calculate the linear response of @xmath207 to a local field directly leads to relation ( [ eq : friedel - magnetization ] ) between @xmath50 and @xmath44 .",
