    "nowadays , there is little doubt that the universe is currently undergoing an acceleration of its expansion .",
    "this is supported by the overwhelming evidence provided by cosmological observations from type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies measured with the wmap satellite @xcite , large scale structure @xcite , weak lensing @xcite and the integrated sach - wolfe effect @xcite . in order to explain why this happens ,",
    "it is usual to postulate the existence of a substance , dubbed dark energy ( de ) , that behaves as if it had negative pressure and is responsible for this present cosmic acceleration . see @xcite for a recent reviews on de models .",
    "nevertheless , the underlying physical mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unknown what has led to explore other possibilities such us the quantum cosmic model @xcite or @xmath5 theories @xcite .",
    "a new model of de , under the name of veneziano ghost dark energy ( gde ) , has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "veneziano ghost is supposed to exist for solving the @xmath6 problem in low - energy effective theory of qcd @xcite , although it is completely decoupled from the physical sector @xcite .",
    "the central point in the gde model is that the veneziano ghost , being unphysical in the qft formulation in the minkowski spacetime , exhibits important non - trivial physical effects in an expanding universe such as our friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , or in a spacetime with non - trivial topological structure . these effects are naturally small and give rise to a vacuum energy density @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the qcd mass scale and @xmath9 is the hubble parameter @xcite . with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "this small vacuum energy density has precisely the right value to be the driving force accelerating the universe today @xcite .",
    "this remarkable coincidence implies that the gde model is free from the fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "in addition , the appearance of the qcd scale could be relevant for a solution to the cosmic coincidence problem , as it may be the scale at which dark matter ( dm ) forms  @xcite .",
    "in general , it is very difficult to accept such a linear behaviour in the energy density because qcd is a theory with a mass gap determined by the scale @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , it is generally expected that there should be exponentially small corrections rather than linear corrections @xmath13 . in refs .",
    "@xcite this question has been elaborated in detail where it has been argued that the linear scaling @xmath13 is due to the complicated topological structure of strongly coupled qcd , not related to the physical massive propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "the advantage of the gde model , when compared to other de models , is that the de can be totally explained within the standard model and general relativity , without resorting to any new field , new degree(s ) of freedom , new symmetries or modifications of gravity @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of the gde model has been studied in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the gde model has been fitted with current observational data including snia , bao , cmb , bbn and hubble parameter and although it was found that the current data do not favour the gde model when compared to the @xmath14cdm model @xcite , the result is not conclusive and further study is needed .",
    "we also note that models with similar terms in the friedmann equation were introduced some time ago in frames of inhomogeneous or imperfect fluids ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one clarification is in order since there are some dark energy models where the ghost plays the role of dark energy ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and becomes a real propagating physical degree of freedom subject to some severe constraints .",
    "however , the veneziano ghost is not a new physical propagating degree of freedom and therefore the gde model does not violate unitarity , causality , gauge invariance and other important features of renormalizable quantum field theory , as advocated in @xcite . at the same time , it has been emphasized in @xcite , and especially later in @xcite , that in fact the description of gde in terms of the veneziano ghost is just a matter of convenience to describe very complicated infrared dynamics of strongly coupled qcd .",
    "one can describe the same dynamics using some other approaches ( e.g. direct lattice simulations ) without using the ghost .    on the other hand ,",
    "as is well known , scalar field models are an effective description of an underlying theory of de . from a given equation of state ( eos ) describing a fluid ,",
    "a scalar field model can be derived ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this correspondence , however , is not in general one to one : scalar fields have an extra degree of freedom and therefore show a dynamics that is more involved .",
    "the question is to what extent the model admits a solution that acts as an attractor , so that it can mimic the fluid evolution thereby avoiding a strong fine tuning problem that would render the model useless .",
    "scalar fields are popular not only because of their mathematical simplicity and phenomenological richness , but also because they naturally arise in particle physics including supersymmetric field theories and string / m theory .",
    "however , these fundamental theories do not predict their potential @xmath15 or kinetic term uniquely . our aim is to investigate whether a minimally coupled scalar field with a specific lagrangian can mimic the dynamics of the gde model so that this model can be related to some fundamental theory , as it is for a scalar field . for this task ,",
    "it is then meaningful to reconstruct the @xmath15 or the kinetic term of a de model possessing some significant features of the underlying theory of de , such as the gde model . in order to do that",
    ", we establish a correspondence between the scalar field and the gde by identifying their respective energy densities and equations of state and then reconstruct the potential ( if the scalar field is quintessence or the tachyon , for instance ) or the kinetic term ( k - essence belongs to this class ) and the dynamics of the field .",
    "some work has already been done in this direction .",
    "quintessence and tachyonic gde models have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in this paper , within the different candidates to play the role of the de , we have chosen the kinetic k - essence , as this has emerged as a possible source of de @xcite where the cosmic acceleration can be realised by the kinetic energy @xmath16 of the field @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , the correspondence between the kinetic k - essence field and the holographic de model was already explored in @xcite .",
    "quintessence and tachyonic models belong to k - essence . in k - essence , the higher order terms are not necessarily negligible which , interestingly , can give rise to new dynamics not possible in quintessence .",
    "every quintessence model can be viewed as a k - essence model generated by a kinetic linear function . on the other hand ,",
    "the tachyon model is classified as k - essence because it belongs to a class of the action for the k - essence .",
    "however , in the sense that the kinetic energy of the tachyon needs to be suppressed to realise cosmic acceleration , this scenario is different from k - essence . finally , an advantage of purely kinetic k - essence lagrangians , thanks to its technical naturalness as from a shift symmetry , is that possess a single degree of freedom , @xmath18 , like quintessence .",
    "the rest of the paper can be outlined as follows . in the next section",
    "we reconstruct the kinetic k - essence gde model in the light of the gde . in section iii",
    "we extend the study to the interacting gde model by using the latest data from observations .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "let us start with a spatially flat frw universe filled with a matter component and gde .",
    "the friedmann equation , which governs its dynamics , reads    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the energy density of pressureless dm and @xmath21 is the gde density .    by introducing the dimensionless density parameters @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the critical energy density ,",
    "the friedmann equation can also be written as @xmath24 equivalently , eq .",
    "( [ fried ] ) can be expressed as @xmath25^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the redshift and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the current values for @xmath9 and @xmath29 .",
    "the gde density is proportional to the hubble parameter @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath1 is a constant of order @xmath31 and @xmath3 is the qcd mass scale .",
    "the conservation equations are given by @xmath32 if we now take the time derivative of the gde density ( [ gde ] ) and use the friedmann equation we arrive at @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ratio of the energy densities . by substituting the relation ( [ dotrho1 ] ) into the continuity equation ( [ consd ] ) , and after using ( [ u1 ] ) we get the dynamical equation of state ( eos ) of gde @xmath35    , for the ghost dark energy model . ]    at early times , when the de is negligible , @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 .",
    "on the other hand , at late times , de dominates , @xmath38 , and the gde behaves as a cosmological constant with @xmath39 entering the de sitter phase in the far future .",
    "the sn ia observations have provided information of the cosmic expansion history around the redshift @xmath40 by the measurement of luminosity distances of the sources , which is also the range spanned by direct measurements of the hubble parameter .",
    "therefore , we plot all the figures in this paper in the redshift range between @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in fig .",
    "1 the evolution of @xmath43 is shown as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "it is clear to see that @xmath43 evolves in the region @xmath45 , so the gde model can not realise the phantom crossing .",
    "it is important to mention that in this model , unlike other models of de , the evolution of @xmath43 is completely determined by the dynamics of @xmath46 .",
    "we notice that @xmath47 , which is @xmath48 off according to wmap  @xcite . however , our equation of state is dynamical so this statement is significantly weakened in this case . indeed ,",
    "wmap in this case only measures the integrated equation of state from last scattering to now , which does not provide much information on its effective time dependence  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the usual ansatz for the linear redshift dependence , @xmath49 , does not necessarily provide a good fit for the behaviour shown in fig.1 .     for the ghost dark energy model .",
    "]    if we now take the time derivative of @xmath50 , we get @xmath51 which allows us to get @xmath52 combining the friedmann equation with eqs .",
    "( [ u1 ] ) and ( [ wd1 ] ) we obtain the differential equation that governs the whole dynamics of the gde @xcite @xmath53    in fig .",
    "2 we have plotted the evolution of @xmath54 as a function of @xmath44 , where @xmath55 is the value of @xmath54 at the present epoch .",
    "it can be seen that de dominates at late times .",
    ", for the ghost dark energy model . ]    we can also compute the deceleration parameter    @xmath56    where eqs .",
    "( [ omegaprime1 ] ) and ( [ omegaprime2 ] ) have been used after the second equal sign .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath57 develops from @xmath58 at early times , when @xmath36 , to @xmath59 at late times when de dominates and @xmath38 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath57 is plotted in fig .",
    "3 where the transition from deceleration to acceleration is seen to occur at @xmath60 . also , when we take @xmath55 , the value of the deceleration parameter at the present era is @xmath61 , well in agreement with recent observational data @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to establish the correspondence between gde and the kinetic k - essence scalar field . as a de candidate ,",
    "k - essence @xcite is usually defined as a scalar field @xmath17 with a non - canonical kinetic energy associated with a lagrangian @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the potential and @xmath64 is the kinetic term . in the case of the k - essence scalar field , the negative pressure that explains",
    "the accelerated expansion arises out of modifications to the kinetic energy .",
    "k - essence models are described by an effective minimally coupled scalar field with a non - canonical term .",
    "if for a moment we neglect the part of the lagrangian containing ordinary matter , the general action for a k - essence field @xmath17 minimally coupled to gravity is    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is an arbitrary function of @xmath17 and its kinetic energy @xmath16 .",
    "a possible motivation for actions of this form comes from considering low - energy effective string theory in the presence of a high - order derivative terms .",
    "in what follows , we shall work with the simple k - essence models for which the potential @xmath67 constant @xcite .",
    "we also assume that @xmath68 without any loss of generality .",
    "one reason for studying k - essence it that it is possible to construct a particularly interesting class of such models in which the k - essence energy density tracks the radiation energy density during the radiation - dominated era , but then evolves toward a constant - density de component during the matter - dominated era .",
    "such behaviour can to a certain degree solve the coincidence problem @xcite . because of this dynamical attractor behaviour , the cosmic evolution is insensitive to initial conditions .",
    "another feature of k - essence is that it changes its speed of evolution in dynamic response to changes in the background equation of state .",
    "we now restrict ourselves to the subclass of kinetic k - essence , with an action independent of @xmath17 @xmath69    the consideration of constraints on purely kinetic k - essence models from the latest observational data by applying model comparison statistics ( f - test , @xmath70 , and bic ) has found that these models are favoured over the @xmath14cdm by the combined data @xcite .",
    "we assume a frw metric @xmath71 and consider @xmath17 to be smooth on scales of interest so that @xmath72 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the k - essence is obtained by varying the action ( [ actionkessence ] ) with respect to the metric , yielding @xmath73 where the subscript @xmath16 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath16 . identifying ( [ energy - momentkessence ] ) with the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid we have the k - essence energy density @xmath74 and pressure @xmath75",
    "@xmath76    and @xmath77    assuming as usual that the energy density is positive , we have that @xmath78 .",
    "the equation of state for the k - essence fluid can be written as @xmath79 with with @xmath80 , @xmath81 as long as the condition @xmath82 is satisfied , @xmath83 can be close to @xmath59 .",
    "besides , the effective sound speed for the kinetic k - essence , which is the quantity relevant for the growth of perturbations , is expressed as @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the definition of the sound speed comes from the equation describing the evolution of linear adiabatic perturbations in a k - essence dominated universe @xcite ( the non - adiabatic perturbation was discussed in @xcite , here we only consider the case of adiabatic perturbations ) .",
    "perturbations can become unstable if the sound speed is imaginary , @xmath86 and there would be unpleasant consequences for structure formation .",
    "this is not , however , the case for the veneziano ghost since it is not a physical propagating degree of freedom and therefore the notion of the speed of sound does not exist in this context . a potentially interesting requirement to consider is @xmath87 , which says that the sound speed should not exceed the speed of light , which suggests violation of causality . though this is an open problem ( see e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the k - essence models constructed to solve the coincidence problem inevitably give rise to the superluminal propagation of the field ( @xmath88 ) at some stage of the cosmological evolution @xcite .     in units of @xmath89 for the ghost dark energy model . ]     in units of @xmath90 for the ghost dark energy model . ]    for a flat frw metric , applying the euler - lagrange equation for the field to the action ( [ actionkessence ] ) we find the equation of motion for k - essence field @xmath91 which can be rewritten in terms of @xmath16 as @xmath92 if we now change the independent variable from time @xmath93 to the scale factor @xmath94 , we obtain @xmath95 this equation can be integrated exactly , for arbitrary @xmath96 , yielding @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a constant of integration @xcite .",
    "this solution had been previously derived in a different form in @xcite . given a function @xmath4 , eq.([phiequation3 ] )",
    "allows us to find solutions @xmath99 and then the other parameters of the k - essence fluid like @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath83 and @xmath100 as a function of the redshift , @xmath44 . the stable nodes of eq .",

    "6 as a function of @xmath118 . from figs . 5 and 6 we can see the dynamics of the kinetic k - essence field explicitly . from fig .",
    "6 we can see that the reconstructed @xmath116 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath118 , well - behaved and a single valued function in the relevant redshift range .",
    "this is because for @xmath119 , the sign of @xmath120 is related to the value of @xmath83 .",
    "it is important to indicate that the reconstruction of @xmath121 only involves the portion of it over which the field evolves to give the required @xmath122 .",
    "the behaviour of this model approaches a de sitter phase in the late time .",
    "to further study the gde model , we shall consider a possible interaction between dm and de .",
    "the interacting models were first proposed by wetterich in an attempt to lower down the value of the cosmological term @xcite .",
    "later on , it was proved to be efficient in alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite unlike the @xmath14cdm which can not address it .",
    "in addition , the interaction may not only be likely but inevitable @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , ignoring the interaction may result in a misled interpretation of the data regarding the equation of state of de .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that a measured phantom equation of state may be mimicked by an interaction @xcite .",
    ", for the interacting ghost dark energy model . ]    it is usually assumed that both dm and de only couple gravitationally .",
    "however , given their unknown nature and that the underlying symmetry that would set the interaction to zero is still to be discovered , an entirely independent behaviour between them would be very special indeed .",
    "assuming that the de is a field , it would be more natural for it to couple with the remaining fields of the theory , in particular with dm , as it is quite a general fact that different fields generally couple . moreover ,",
    "since de gravitates , it must be accreted by massive compact objects such as black holes and , in a cosmological context , the energy transfer from de to dm may be small but non - vanishing .",
    ", for the interacting ghost dark energy model . ]    in spite of the fact that the available empirical data can not discriminate between the existence of a small interaction and its total absence , there are some indications that favour the interaction : ( i ) the interaction affects the time required for a self - gravitating , collapsing , structure to reach equilibrium as well as the equilibrium configuration itself , which implies that the layzer - irvine equation @xcite has to be generalised to include the interaction . in this regard , it has been observed a small interaction when studying the dynamics of a group of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "( ii ) since the interaction modifies the rate of evolution of the metric potentials , the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) component of the cmb radiation is enhanced .",
    "in fact , it has been recently disclosed that the late isw effect has the unique ability to provide an insight into the coupling @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation of galaxy catalogs with cmb maps also suggests a small interaction @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have been devoted to analyse the constraints on the interaction from the probes of the cosmic expansion history by using the wmap , snia , bao and sdss data , etc . @xcite .",
    "complementary probes of the coupling have been carried out in the study of the growth of cosmic structure @xcite .",
    "it has been also found that a non - zero interaction leaves a clear change in the growth index @xcite .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a possible decay of de into dm consistent with the data .    , for the interacting ghost dark energy model . ]",
    "if de couples to dm through some interaction , this affects the past expansion history of the universe as well as the cosmic structure formation .",
    "the matter density , @xmath123 , drops more slowly than @xmath124 .",
    "a slower matter density evolution fits the supernovae data as well as the @xmath14cdm concordance model does @xcite .",
    "the interaction also alters the age of the universe , the evolution of matter and radiation perturbations and gives rise to a different matter and radiation power spectra . in the absence of a fundamental theory for de",
    ", the coupling term can not be derived from microphysics .",
    "most studies on the interaction between dark sectors rely either on the assumption of interacting fields from the outset @xcite , or from phenomenological requirements @xcite .",
    "the aforesaid interaction has also been considered from a thermodynamical perspective @xcite and has been shown that the second law of thermodynamics imposes an energy transfer from de to dm .",
    "other authors have analysed the possibility of having dm decaying into de but it is required to have at least one of the fluids with a non null chemical potential , an assumption that which we believe it is not completely acceptable as it introduces too many unjustified components , and also relies on the assumption of a nearly standard evolution of pertubations on interacting de models @xcite . on the other hand , having a energy transfer from dm to de would worsen the coincidence problem @xcite .    in the case of an interaction between gde and dm ,",
    "their energy densities no longer satisfy independent conservation laws .",
    "they obey instead @xmath125 @xmath126where @xmath127 is an interaction term whose form is not unique .",

    "10 and 11 , respectively .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath121 is plotted in fig .",
    "we learn from these figures that the reconstructed scalar field has the same dynamics as the non - interacting case , which is due to the smallness of the coupling that gauges the interaction in the gde model .",
    "this was expected because otherwise the gde model would deviate significantly from the concordance model , making it incompatible with observations @xcite .     for the interacting ghost dark energy model . ]     and @xmath29 with respect to @xmath44 for the interacting ghost dark energy model . ]     and @xmath123 in units of @xmath166 with respect to @xmath44 for the interacting ghost dark energy model . ]     for the interacting ghost dark energy model . ]    in fig .",
    "11 the effect of the interaction between gde and dm is displayed and we see that @xmath54 evolves at a faster rate in the interacting case",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "14 shows the point where @xmath109 and @xmath123 cross , @xmath167 , takes place earlier when the interaction is present .",
    "this latter feature is appreciated in more detail in fig .",
    "15 where the dependence of the ratio @xmath168 with respect to @xmath44 is depicted .",
    "this ratio @xmath169 decreases monotonously with the expansion and varies slowly at the present epoch .",
    "this reduction is slower when the interaction is considered , implying that in this scenario the coincidence problem gets substantially alleviated and besides , that de is decaying into dm in recent epochs .",
    "the veneziano ghost dark energy ( gde ) has been recently proposed as a new model of dark energy .",
    "the crucial ingredient , the veneziano ghost , shows important non - trivial physical effects in a dynamical background such as our frw expanding universe , or in a spacetime with a non - trivial topology .",
    "these small effects produce a vacuum energy density @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the qcd mass scale and @xmath9 is the hubble parameter . given that @xmath10 and @xmath11 , this @xmath109 has the right value to drive the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "the advantages of the gde with respect to other dark energy models include the absence of the fine tuning problem and the fact that it can be completely explained within the standard model and general relativity , without recoursing to any new field , new degree(s ) of freedom , new symmetries or modifications of general relativity .    for some time , to consider scalar field models of dark energy as effective theories of an underlying theory of dark energy has been a mainstream idea . in this spirit , we have investigated the prospects of reproducing the behaviour of the gde model with the kinetic k - essence scalar field model with an appropriate lagrangian , also studying the case of a possible interaction between dark matter and dark energy . for this purpose ,",
    "we have established a correspondence between the gde and the kinetic k - essence field , by identifying their respective energy densities and equations of state , and reconstructed the kinetic k - essence gde model in the region @xmath170 .",
    "describing the gde model in a scalar field framework provides a more fundamental representation of the dark component .",
    "finally , we have executed an exhaustive analysis of its evolution and dynamics where we have found that it is possible to obtain an equivalent description of the dark fluid in the case of a purely kinetic k - essence lagrangian and the model is able to reproduce the correct behaviour of the cosmological background for @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the coincidence problem gets substantially alleviated when the interaction between dark energy and dark matter is taken into account .",
