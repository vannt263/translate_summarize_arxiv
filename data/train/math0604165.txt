    "the history of associating @xmath0-algebras to symbolic dynamical systems is long and successful .    a good example of this is the crossed product of infinite minimal two - sided shift spaces which in @xcite was used to classify infinite minimal shift spaces up till strong orbit equivalence and flip conjugacy ( it is actually done for a bigger class of dynamical systems , namely cantor systems , but we will in this paper only concern ourselves with symbolic dynamical systems ) .",
    "another very important example of a class of @xmath0-algebras associated to symbolic dynamical systems is the cuntz - krieger algebras @xcite , which in a natural way can be viewed as @xmath0-algebras associated to topological markov chains with finite state space .",
    "the cuntz - krieger algebras have proved to be very important examples in the theory of @xmath0-algebras and have also let to invariants of shift of finite type such as the dimension group ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the cuntz - krieger algebras have been generalized in many different ways .",
    "we will in this paper focus on two of those .",
    "the first one is due to exel and lace , who in @xcite have generalized the cuntz - krieger algebras to topological markov chains with arbitrary state space .",
    "the other generalization is due to matsumoto , who in @xcite associated a @xmath0-algebra to every shift space ( called a subshift in that paper ) .",
    "matsumoto s original construction associated a @xmath0-algebra to every _ two - sided _ shift space , but it is more natural to view it as a way to associated a @xmath0-algebra to every _ one - sided _ shift space ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "topological markov chains with finite state space are examples of one - sided shift spaces , and it turns out that the @xmath0-algebras associated to these kind of shift spaces are cuntz - krieger algebras , so in this way the class of @xmath0-algebras associated with shift spaces is a generalization of the class of cuntz - krieger algebras ( cf .",
    "@xcite*section 8) .",
    "thus we have three different classes of @xmath0-algebras associated to symbolic dynamical system , namely crossed products of two - sided shift spaces , exel and laca s generalization of cuntz - krieger algebras and @xmath0-algebras associated to one - sided shift spaces .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to unify these three constructions to one .",
    "my original motivation for written this paper was to prove theorem [ theorem : toke ] , which for shift spaces having a certain property relates the crossed product of the two - sided shift space and the @xmath0-algebra associated to the corresponding one - sided shift space .",
    "doing this i found that the crossed product of two - sided shift spaces and the @xmath0-algebra associated to one - sided shift spaces have a common structure , which i also found in exel and laca s generalization of cuntz - krieger algebras ( which we for simplicity from now on just will call cuntz - krieger algebras ) .",
    "this structure can be described by partial representations of groups and boolean algebras .",
    "more formal , what we will do is to associate to every so called discrete partial dynamical system a @xmath0-algebra and then to every symbolic dynamical system ( both one - sided and two - sided ) associate a discrete partial dynamical system in such a way that the @xmath0-algebras we get in this way for one - sided shift spaces , two - sided shift spaces and topological markov chains are canonical isomorphic to the @xmath0-algebra associated to the one - sided shift space , the crossed product of the two - sided shift space and the unitization of the cuntz - krieger of the transition matrix of the topological markov chain , respectively .",
    "this construction is very natural , and i hope that beside the benefits from having a unified construction of these different classes of @xmath0-algebras associated to different kinds of symbolic dynamical systems , the construction will also clarify in which way the structure of the symbolic dynamical system is reflected in the structure of the associated @xmath0-algebra .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : notat ] , we will shortly introduce some notation which will be used throughout the paper , in section [ ekse ] _ discrete partial dynamical systems _ will be defined , and we will see how we from one- and two - sided symbolic dynamical systems can construct discrete partial dynamical systems . we will then in section [ sec : cs - algebra ]",
    "define the @xmath0-algebra of a discrete partial dynamical system and show some basic properties of it .",
    "in section [ sec : construction ] we will show the @xmath0-algebra of a discrete partial dynamical system can be constructed as a crossed product of a @xmath0-partial dynamical systems , and we will in section [ sec : repr ] construct a representation of the @xmath0-algebra of a discrete partial dynamical system as operators on a hilbert space .",
    "section [ retu ] is the main section of this paper ; here we will show that the crossed product of a two - sided shift space , the @xmath0-algebra of a one - sided shift space , and cuntz - krieger algebras can be obtained as @xmath0-algebras of discrete partial dynamical systems .",
    "we will then in section [ sec : ideal ] describe the ideal structure of the @xmath0-algebra of a discrete partial dynamical system and then use this description to prove the above mentioned theorem [ theorem : toke ] .",
    "the paper finish with three appendices in which we will give a short introduction to partial representations of groups , boolean algebras and crossed products of @xmath0-partial dynamical systems .    a previous version of this paper appeared in my ph.d thesis @xcite .",
    "unfortunately that version contained a lot of mistakes , which hopefully have been fixed in this version .",
    "the most notable of these mistakes was that i claimed that the @xmath0-algebra of a higher rank graph could be constructed as the @xmath0-algebra of a discrete partial dynamical system .",
    "the proof of this is however false , but it is possible to construct the @xmath0-algebras of a higher rank graph in a very similar way by using an action of an ( discrete ) inverse semigroup instead of a partial action of a ( discrete ) group .",
    "this will be proved in a forthcoming paper by gwion evans and the author .",
    "the process of writing this paper has been very long .",
    "i started on it will i was a ph.d - student at the university of copenhagen , i continued working on it while i was a post doc at the institut mittag - leffler and at the norwegian university of science and technology and i finally finished it as a post doc at universit \" at m \" unster .",
