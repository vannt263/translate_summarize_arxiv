    "the @xmath1 correspondence @xcite links a large n d - dimensional conformal field theory to a quantum theory in @xmath2 .",
    "more specifically , local operators of the conformal field theory are related to fields of the dual quantum gravity theory @xcite .",
    "however , ads / cft and the more general gauge - gravity theories can be used to study non - local operators as well .",
    "one of the most interesting of such operators is the wilson loop @xcite .",
    "it is accessible from the string theory side , which is computationally significant and physically , it provides a basis for gauge invariant gluonic operators .",
    "but even more important here , the potential of a quark - antiquark pair can be related to the vev of a rectangular wilson loop , whose sides are equal to the @xmath3 separation and @xmath4 . in the gauge theory",
    "the wilson loop @xmath5 along a curve @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7\\}.\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the number of colors , @xmath9 represents the path ordering of the exponential and @xmath10 are the gauge fields . in this paper",
    "we will assume the gauge fields to be in the fundamental representation , however higher order representations are feasible @xcite .",
    "on the string side of the correspondence we have @xcite @xmath11}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is used to denote all fields of the string theory and @xmath13 their boundary values along @xmath6 .",
    "we can approximate using the steepest descent method . here , the surface spanned by the strings ending on @xmath6 and obeying the nambu - goto action @xmath14 , is minimised . now , that we have approximated the vev of the wilson loop and we know that we can relate the @xmath15 potential to this vev by @xmath16 we see that @xmath17    convinced of the importance of wilson loops , we will compute its properties for backgrounds proposed in @xcite , deepening our understanding of those solutions .",
    "these sets of solutions , are very interesting as they relate two very fruitful extensions of the original @xmath1 correspondence .",
    "one of the extension is referred to as klebanov - strassler ( ks ) models @xcite . here",
    ", a deformation is introduced that corresponds to an imbalance in the gauge groups of the field theory side of the correspondence .",
    "this puts the field theory in the mesonic branch @xcite .",
    "the other extension is usually referred to as wrapped brane models @xcite . here , we obtain the field theory through a higher dimensional field theory on which we perform a kaluza - klein compactification with twisting .",
    "our solution are ks like as they share the same ir and uv behaviour , and nontrivially relate to wrapped - brane models as they can be constructed from such a model by the addition of @xmath18 sources and applying u - duality , a solution generating technique introduced in @xcite .",
    "the setup of the paper will be as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss how to compute wilson loops using holography . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the backgrounds of interest and study them using wilson loops .",
    "section 4 then deals with the occurence of phase transitions and explains why and how they occur .",
    "section 5 tests our interpretation of the phase transitions and provides a technique for creating backgrounds with arbitrary many phase transitions .",
    "section 6 then summarises the results obtained .",
    "here , i will discuss how to compute wilson loops , as well as the potential energy of the @xmath15-pair using the ideas from above for holographic theories .",
    "the following is based on @xcite .",
    "consider a 10d spacetime : @xmath19 as well as the nambu - goto action @xmath20}\\ ] ] now using the string gauge @xmath21 and @xmath22 and not allowing the string to explore then internal space , we can transform to @xmath23 where @xmath24 now , one can either solve the euler - lagrange equations of this system or transfer to the hamiltonian picture and note that the hamiltonian in the @xmath25 direction is a constant of motion as the lagrangian is independent of @xmath26 .",
    "either way , one will derive the following equation of motion for the string : @xmath27 from here one can calculate that the length @xmath28 of the static string configuration connecting two quarks is @xmath29 now that we have all the ingredients we need , we can use equation   to obtain @xmath30 , the potential energy of the quark - antiquark pair as a function of their seperation .",
    "this result is generally divergent , as we have to assume infinite quark masses in order to make the qq - pair static , which in turn allows us to obtain the rectangular wilson loops needed",
    ". the infinite potential energy can be renormalized by subtracting the mass of the quarks @xmath31 .",
    "the renormalized result is @xmath32 now , the backgrounds @xcite we will focus on might only be related to wrapped brane models in the technical sense discussed in the introduction , but due the fact that wrapped brane models are relatively simple to study , we will sketch the construction of our solutions of interest on their basis .",
    "we start from a generic wrapped brane model , modify it by applying the solution generating technique referred to as u - duality ( or rotation ) and add @xmath18 sources .",
    "first , these sources are introduced naively , but then will be distributed according to profiles that become increasingly complex in order to correct more and more unphysical behaviours that will be discussed in more detail . at every stage",
    "we will evaluate equations  and   to illustrate the behaviour of wilson loops discussed .",
    "afterwards we will construct cases , where the change of e(l ) to linear behaviour is started off by a phase transition .",
    "this is then generalised to obtain solutions that produce several phase transitions .",
    "the wrapped brane models consist of a metric @xmath33 , a dilaton @xmath34 and an rr - three form @xmath35 . to write down the background , we use @xmath36 left - invariant one - forms @xmath37[su2 ] and the vielbeins @xmath38 thus , in the einstein frame , we have @xmath39 where we defined @xmath40      to connect to section  [ sonnenschein ] , we have to move from the einstein frame to the string frame",
    ". the metric can be obtained by multiplying @xmath41 by @xmath42 .",
    "the metric elements relevant for the wilson loop computation become @xmath43 there are 6 functions in the background @xmath44 which depend on the radial coordinate @xmath45 .",
    "the background is determined by solving the equations of motion for these functions .",
    "a system of bps equations can be derived@xcite .",
    "these equations show that all background functions can be expressed in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath9 is a solution to the following differential equation @xmath49 is usually referred to as the master equation .",
    "the background functions of interest to us are @xmath50 a completely analytical solution is given by @xmath51 it leads to the background discussed in @xcite .",
    "other solutions can be found semi - analytically .",
    "interesting and well studied - solutions can be found by numerically connecting the large @xmath52 expansion @xmath53\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the ir expansion @xmath54 see for example @xcite .",
    "here it was shown that this type of solution corresponds to the addition of a an irrelevant operator which in turn requires a uv completion .    such a completion that again make contact with klebanov - strassler theories in the ir is given by a u - duality as it is described in @xcite.this procedure has also been referred to as a rotation .",
    "it is a solution generating technique that schematically unites the backgrounds , by taking a solution to our master equation and mapping it to another background where new fluxes are turned on . while neither the background functions , nor @xmath55 and @xmath9 change , the metric does and new fluxes are turned on .",
    "the metric elements relevant to our calculations are @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be chosen to be @xmath59 , see @xcite .",
    "we study the rectangular wilson loop for , as well as for rotated and unrotated numerical solutions connecting with . in the numerical case",
    ", we first solve the master equation using and its derivative as initial conditions .",
    "we then obtain the background functions using the relations  .",
    "we then solve the nambu - goto action , as outlined in section  [ sonnenschein ] to obtain @xmath60 and @xmath61 given by and .",
    "these two functions can be combined to give us @xmath30 .",
    "this leads to the following plots :    ( 220,170 ) ( -140,0 ) , while green and blue are unrotated / rotated numerical solutions respectively . for the constants we chose @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64,title=\"fig : \" ] ( -137,95 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 25,95 ) ( 170,35 ) ( 190,95 ) ( 345,35 )    for the solution with @xmath65 , given by , we can see that there is a minimum seperation length beyond which the quarks can not be forced closer to each other .",
    "in fact , we can easily calculate that @xmath66 this seems to indicate that the quarks are not point - like objects , but have a finite size .",
    "this is not very surprising as it is well known that the analytical solution is not dual to a field theory , but rather a little string theory .",
    "the dynamics of the numerical solutions mirror @xmath67 in the ir . in all three cases",
    "@xmath30 behaves coulomb like below the confinement scale , while @xmath60 initially asymptotes @xmath68 .",
    "this is expected , as @xmath9 is always linear below the confinement scale , but for the numerical solutions it then changes its behaviour to become exponential , in the order to match the uv expansions . at this point @xmath60",
    "starts to increase exponentially for the unrotated case .",
    "this is due to the aforementioned irrelevant dimension 8 operator , coupling to gravity and thus causing the unphysical behaviour observed in the uv , where @xmath30 grows exponentially . after a uv completion given by rotation",
    ", we see that @xmath69 when @xmath70 and we recover linear behaviour for @xmath30 after the confinement scale , as expected for confining theories .",
    "the analysis in this subsection has been very similar to @xcite .",
    "however , in that paper , solutions to the master equation   have been studied , for which it was assumed that @xmath71 .",
    "this leads to an ir behaviour of p that is constant to first order and not linear @xcite .",
    "this has led to some interesting effects like phase transitions . for our ir expansion",
    "we have not been able to find any phase transitions .",
    "however , our case does never feature cusps in the string configuration that would break down the steepest descent approximation , either .",
    "first we add sources in the original , naive way as described in @xcite , without any kind of profile describing the distribution of the @xmath18 branes .",
    "this time the form of the metric remains unchanged , while the background functions follow different equations .",
    "see @xcite for reference . @xmath55 and @xmath9 are now given by @xmath72=0\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ & & q(\\r)= \\frac{2n_c - n_f}{2}(2\\r \\coth(2\\r)-1)\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now have for our background functions @xmath73 we require new ir asymptotes reflecting the addition of @xmath18 sources .",
    "the ones befitting our case are @xcite @xmath74 unfortunately , we have adopted an ir singularity caused by the high density stacking of the branes near @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this leads to an unphysical background , which can also be seen through the study of the wilson loops @xcite    , @xmath62 , @xmath76 and @xmath77    note the cusp in the function @xmath30 .",
    "this is a visual indication of the fact that the way we introduced sources causes us problems .",
    "as described in @xcite , we can avoid this singularity by distributing the sources such that not all sources reach @xmath78 .",
    "of importance is the fact that the density profile for the sources has a maclaurin series with leading term at least of order @xmath79 .",
    "a simple profile that fulfils the requirements - see @xcite - is @xmath80 note that its ir expansion is @xmath81\\ ] ]    as required .",
    "following @xcite , we now have @xmath82=0\\\\ & q = \\coth(2\\r)\\big[\\int_0^\\r dx   \\frac{2n_c -n_fs(x)}{\\coth^2(2x)}\\big]\\nonumber\\\\ & e^{2k}=\\frac{p'+n_fs}{2}\\nonumber\\\\ & e^{4\\phi-4\\phi_0}=\\frac{2\\sinh(2\\r)^2}{(p^2-q^2)(p'+n_fs)}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] please note , comparing with the case without flavor profile , it seems that the analysis was simply generalised by replacing @xmath83 everywhere .",
    "this is not quite true , seen for example at the new form the equation governing q takes .",
    "we get    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86    as one can see , @xmath30 behaves smoothly again .",
    "let us define @xmath87 to be the value of @xmath88 for which @xmath9 remains linear in the uv .",
    "note that @xmath89 here , thus @xmath9 remains linear for quite some time , resulting in @xmath60 plateauing before approaching @xmath90 .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the uv behaviour is improved by using a profile that decays like @xmath91 .",
    "this is due to the fact that to preserve the ks like uv asymptotic behaviour , we need a profile that decays at least that fast .",
    "the presence of an exponentially increasing number of source branes , as is the case for a profile where @xmath92 , behaves like the insertion of an irrelevant operator that deforms the uv dynamics .",
    "we also would not want a profile that decays faster to keep @xmath93 , representing the mass density of the sources , positive everywhere . to have @xmath94 exactly , a profile that decays like @xmath95",
    "is needed .",
    "thus the following two profiles will be of importance .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "@xmath96 @xmath97 which look like     is blue while @xmath98 is red , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    note that @xmath99 .",
    "while this can be quite easily analytically continued to be @xmath100 , numerical calculations using this profile have to be dealt with carefully .",
    "the approach in this paper is based on the following idea . as the ir expansion of this profile is @xmath101)\\ ] ] we define @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "we then solve for @xmath104 and @xmath105 by demanding that @xmath98 and @xmath106 are continuous at @xmath107 .",
    "for simpler numerics at this stage , let us use @xmath108 for now , and observe that we get a very similar picture to the previous subsections .",
    ", @xmath62 , @xmath76 and @xmath109    as we can see , the behaviour of the wilson loop is as expected for a confining theory , and no area of concern can be found due to the study of this observable in this background .",
    "note that , as described in @xcite , all profiles used in this paper lack a rigorous proof of existence , as the profiles are not derived from a kappa - symmetric embedding .",
    "however , the healthy behaviour of the backgrounds found in this and other works on these backgrounds suggests that they are nonetheless physically relevant .",
    "an interesting observable phenomenon that can be found is a phase transition .",
    "this was first observed for sqcd - like field theories in @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of such a phenomena is similar to the phase transition of a boiling van - der - waals gas .",
    "several other papers have found such a phenomena in similar cases since .",
    "see for example @xcite    in order to find them for the theory discussed here , the parameter space of varying @xmath88 was explored .",
    "please note that not all values of @xmath88 are valid .",
    "there always exists a critical value for @xmath88 , for which @xmath9 grows linearly . for @xmath110 , @xmath9 grows exponentially in the uv and for @xmath111 , @xmath9 dies down to a singularity .",
    "note the following figure .     for @xmath87 , red @xmath112 and blue @xmath113,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "our requirement for @xmath34 to be bounded only allows exponentially growing solutions like the red curve .",
    "thus a shooting procedure was used to find @xmath87 , which was used as starting value for our exploration into ever increasing values of @xmath88 .",
    "unfortunately the search for a phase transition was unsuccessful for the three profiles , and mentioned above .",
    "to see how to proceed from here , let us analyse that van - der - waals gas analogy from the beginning of the section more closely .",
    "such a gas follows an equation of state of the form @xmath114 where @xmath115 are constants .",
    "look at the diagrams borrowed from @xcite     as a function of the volume @xmath116 ( left panel ) and the gibbs free energy @xmath117 as a function of the pressure @xmath9(right panel ) for the same isotherm curve.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   as a function of the volume @xmath116 ( left panel ) and the gibbs free energy @xmath117 as a function of the pressure @xmath9(right panel ) for the same isotherm curve.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    clearly this analogy works by linking @xmath60 to @xmath118 as well as @xmath30 to @xmath119 , such that @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . on the vdw side , it is clear that a phase transition will be observed , if @xmath118 has a local maximum .",
    "this can be achieved by tuning two scales , dictated by the constants @xmath104 and @xmath105 , representing the interaction between the vdw gas particles and their non - zero size respectively .",
    "we have so far only explored a 1-dimensional parameter space . to increase our chances of success",
    ", we have to find another parameter to vary .",
    "one thing one can try is to let the source branes not quite reach 0 but only start at some point @xmath123 .",
    "this is easily achieved by multiplying the profile with a step function @xmath124 and performing the coordinate transformation @xmath125 .",
    "so , for example , our bump profile becomes @xmath126 .",
    "numerically , one can simply solve the unflavored system between @xmath90 and @xmath123 and then connect the system by using @xmath127 and @xmath128 as initial conditions for the flavored system .",
    "as shown in @xcite this is justified if @xmath129 which is true in our cases .    here , a phase transition can be found regardless of which profile has been used .",
    "when we studied the parameter space in detail , we found that as we increased @xmath88 , @xmath60 began to flatten in the region just below @xmath123 until a peak appeared that kept getting more pronounced .",
    "see figure  [ lcompare ] .",
    "this behaviour was so typical that we conjecture that given any acceptable profile and @xmath130 a phase transition can be found for this system . as an example",
    "look at the following figures .    ,",
    "@xmath63 , @xmath62 , @xmath76 , @xmath131 and @xmath132    the position of the phase transition is not random and has a nice physical interpretation . before the phase transition the string explores only the sourcefull region , while afterwards a majority of the string is located in the sourceless region @xmath133 .",
    "thus the phase transition appears as more and more of the string enters the sourceless part .    for a given @xmath123 , the value of @xmath88 that produces a phase transition is only bound below .",
    "this also has a nice physical picture associated to it .",
    "@xmath88 is directly related to @xmath134 , the expansion parameter of the uv asymptotes of @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath134 in turn is related to the scale at which @xmath9 stops being linear and starts growing exponential .",
    "this in turn effects the gradient of @xmath30 and thus the `` speed '' with which the string hits the sourceless region . for a more pictorial description ,",
    "the reader may imagine a light ray getting refracted on a block of glass due to the fact that it is slowed down by the medium .",
    "the higher @xmath88 , the sooner @xmath9 becomes exponential , and the `` faster '' the string hits the sourceless region . above a certain threshold we observe phase transitions .     for the exact same system for @xmath135 at the bottom , till @xmath136 in increments of 10 and then at the top for @xmath137.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as the gradient of @xmath60 grows to @xmath138 as @xmath139 , it is clear that the threshold for producing phase transitions , @xmath140 also grows to @xmath138 as @xmath141 .",
    "this relationship between @xmath142 and @xmath140 exists as @xmath88 represents how much @xmath143 is lifted compared to close by points , and a steeper gradient requires more lift . see the figure above . for large @xmath144 , @xmath28 is already quite flat , so even small values of @xmath88 will cause a bump to appear . for small @xmath144 ,",
    "@xmath28 is quite steep , so the initial increase in @xmath88 only flattens the profile .",
    "this is why we have not observed phase transitions just varying @xmath88 and effectively leaving @xmath145 .",
    "of course other parameters in the theory will also influence the development of phase transitions",
    ". please refer to appendix [ influence ] for an exploration of them .",
    "in the last section we have described several ways to achieve phase transitions . this can be best understood through the variation of two scales , dictated by @xmath88 , giving the `` speed '' of the increase of the potential with respect to separation length , and @xmath123 , the scale at which the @xmath18 sources kick in .",
    "in particular , a general characteristic of profiles has been identified that is key in producing phase transitions .",
    "we need a region where the source density rapidly changes to be able to observe them .",
    "this appears to be a universal requirement .",
    "our interpretation of the reason for the occurrence of the phase transitions actually enables us to provide a testable prediction , that can be exploited to produce new phenomena .",
    "something that has been missing so far in the literature , is the possibility to find solutions with more than one phase transition .",
    "below we list several types of profiles that allow us to generate these .    in this paper , we will restrict ourselves to profiles producing two phase transitions as proof of concept .",
    "in general though , these procedures seem to be able to produce an arbitrarily large amount of phase transitions if one so wishes .",
    "the first idea is to add several profiles of the form described in section  [ flavor ] or [ bump ] . here",
    ", we used @xmath146 giving us a the following source profile .     and @xmath147 , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as well as @xmath148 looking like     and @xmath147 , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this leads to the following plots . for the tumbling profile we have     ]    and for the double bump :     ]    notice , that if the jump is from a region of high source density to a region with lower but non - zero source density , the smaller the difference , the harder it is to produce a phase transition , independent from the magnitude of the gradient of the jump .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ tumbling ] , where in the left - hand diagram the second peak is a lot less pronounced than in the right one .",
    "also the tumbling profile in particular can be very interesting for holographic technicolor theories with higgsing cascades . here",
    ", each of the steps in the profile would correspond to a particular generation of quarks .",
    "this case is discussed in @xcite .",
    "encouragingly , the central charge of the solutions of all profiles in this section , including plateau profiles are monotically increasing and thus show no sign of unphysical behaviour . to calculate the central charge",
    ", we used the same definition as in @xcite @xmath149)^3}\\ ] ] this leads to graphs of the following shape :          so far all the phase transitions observed come from the string moving from regions of high source density to regions of lower density .",
    "it would be interesting to see if this also works if we move from low to high density .",
    "thus we would like to engineer profiles that quickly rise from @xmath90 to @xmath150 , stay at @xmath150 for some time before quickly decreasing back to @xmath90 .",
    "it is a major challenge to find such functions and so far none have been found that have a continuous first derivative .",
    "these can still be used , given that the discontinuity is well away from the regions of interest , such as the middle of the plateau , but will lead to an imperfection discussed below .    the easiest way to obtain profiles as described , is to use a profile that behaves like @xmath108 from section  [ flavor ] and [ flat ] and then mirror it around the axis @xmath151 , where @xmath152 and then forcing @xmath153 to be @xmath90 after it reached that value again . as an example we used @xmath154 resulting in    , @xmath155 and @xmath156 , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this leads to the following situation .     and both physical phase transitions ]",
    "please note that @xmath30 has 3 phase transitions , the two physical ones shown above , and one unphysical that is due to the discontinuity of @xmath157 at @xmath158 at which the numerics produce the kink seen for @xmath60 .",
    "note that the background does not contain any singularities per se .",
    "it is just at the exact point of the discontinuity that the numerics break down .",
    "thus this discontinuity is usually not noticeable and does not produce a third unphysical phase transition . in order to highlight this breakdown ,",
    "@xmath60 has been evaluated only at discrete points and then interpolated inbetween",
    ". furthermore @xmath60 was evaluated at exactly @xmath159 to produce an erronous data point .",
    "the purpose of this was to highlight the limitations of the numerical calculation , and illustrate the dangers of using profiles without a continuous derivative . also due to",
    "the different scales and sizes at which the two phase transitions occur , we had to graph them separately to seem them clearly .",
    "thus we have strong evidence that phase transitions also occur when entering region of higher source density .",
    "this leads us to believe , that every bump profile actually produces two phase transitions per bump , that merge into another through an effect that is analogous to the effect that limits the angular resolution of lenses .",
    "both bumps in @xmath60 or @xmath61 of , for example , figure  [ r * ] are so close together that they merge into one .",
    "the basic idea of this paper was to study the details of wilson loops of a novel class of solutions @xcite , that generalise the ks @xcite and baryonic branch @xcite solutions , that , by the addition of sources , move the qft to the mesonic branch ..    this was done constructively , by starting from a relatively plain wrapped branes model and slowly adding all the necessary features , keeping track of the properties of the wilson loops of the theory at each stage .",
    "afterwards we discussed the possibility of creating a phase transition by tuning two scales dictated by @xmath88 and @xmath123 .",
    "this construction of phase transitions has been very successful and yielded a positive outcome in every case .",
    "we also managed to find a reason why these transitions occur .",
    "lastly , the possibility to create several phase transitions has been discussed , and several features a profile needs to produce these have been examined in detail , yielding a double phase transition in each case . in particular , a profile that might become useful for some extended holographic technicolor theories has been described .",
    "my procedures should also be applicable to the 2 + 1 d equivalent that has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "also please note that while confinement has not been directly mentioned , it is generally understood that the theories discussed are confining .",
    "@xcite gives several conditions for @xmath160 and @xmath161 that each guarantee confinement and it is straightforward to check that in all cases at least one of them is fulfilled .",
    "an interesting open question would be a detailed mathematical derivation of the exact requirements needed to obtain a phase transition .",
    "we may have some results on this in the near future .",
    "i would like to thank several people for their support and guidance .",
    "carlos nez , daniel james schofield , niall macpherson and stephen bennett all patiently helped me with all the questions that i could think of .",
    "last but not least i thank sebastian halter for sharing some of his mathematica code that has been very valuable .",
    "my research is funded by the stfc .",
    "of course other variables do also have an effect on the wilson loop and the associated phase transition .",
    "for example , we can generalise the @xmath162 component in the profiles discussed above from , @xmath163 to @xmath164 where @xmath165 is an integer .",
    "this has the conceptual imperfection though , that it pushes the flavour correction in the ir expansion of @xmath9 to higher orders of @xmath52 and thus effectively diminishes the effect of the flavour branes on the system more and more .",
    "also @xmath166 being a variable that affects many aspects of this system , also plays a role for how easy phase transitions can be found . as an example , here is @xmath30 for systems equal to figure  [ r * ] .",
    ", in the middle @xmath167 and on the right @xmath168    please note , that we can also find phase transitions for @xmath169 but higher values of @xmath88 have to be used .",
    "again , one could simply take a whole other class of profiles .",
    "very helpful was @xmath170 based on the flat measure described in @xcite . here ,",
    "analytical conditions are found , that the profile must fulfil , to produce desirable back reactions .",
    "these are then solved in a lengthy but logical procedure whose details are mentioned in the paper cited . if one wishes to have a decaying profile one could use @xmath171 .",
    "these profiles have the following form     is blue while @xmath98 is red , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    both profiles lead to a phase transition . for @xmath108 we have     and @xmath172    and for @xmath98 we get :     and @xmath173    @xmath174 is related to @xmath175 via @xmath176 as @xmath177 decreases , the width of the brane distribution becomes smaller , the mass of the heaviest quark decreases and phase transitions are produced . despite the large amount of control such types of profiles offer , one should be aware , that their realization is not completely clean , in the sense that @xmath157 is not continuous everywhere , which can lead to problems as we will see in the following sections .",
    "here , some odd findings will be collected , that have been discovered during the analysis of the wilson loops of the various maldacena - nunez solutions .",
    "firstly , it might be worth mentioning that , after the addition of flavor sources without as done in the beginning of section [ flavor ] , we can produce a phase transition like behaviour in the lower , physical branch of @xmath30 plot :        another quite surprising fact that was discovered during the search for phase transitions is that while most profiles require @xmath179 to show transition , profiles of the type @xmath180 do not . for @xmath89 , @xmath181 will stay linear for quite some time before exhibiting exponential behaviour .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ p ] . in such cases",
    ", @xmath60 will not immediately approach @xmath90 , but first approach a non - zero value @xmath182 before , and @xmath183 after the transition of @xmath9 s behaviour . depending on several factors , such as the power of @xmath162 , we can force @xmath184 , leading to a very curious phase transition as shown in the following diagram .",
    "please note that beside the phase transition the overall shape of @xmath30 is equivalent to the expected , but one would have to plot it approximately between @xmath188 and @xmath189 to see it .",
    "similarly @xmath190 peaks at about @xmath191 before descending rapidly .",
