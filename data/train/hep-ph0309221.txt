    "the symmetry under the successive operations ( in any order ) of charge conjugation , c , parity ( reflexion ) , p , and time reversal , t , known as cpt , is a fundamental symmetry of any _ local _ quantum field theory in _ flat _ space time , under the following assumptions  @xcite :    * \\(i ) unitarity and the proper definition of a scattering matrix , * \\(ii ) lorentz invariance and * \\(iii ) locality of interactions    in the presence of gravity , i.e. non - minkowski , non - flat space time backgrounds , cpt symmetry may be _ violated _ , at least in _ in its strong form_. this is indeed the case of _ singular _ space - time gravitational backgrounds , such as black holes , or in general space times with boundaries .",
    "the reason is that in such cases the presence of these boundaries jeopardizes requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) of the cpt theorem . in a quantum context ,",
    "a black hole evaporates due to hawking radiation , and as such it may ` capture ' for ever information on matter states passing nearby , as depicted schematically in figure [ bhfoam ] .        in such a case , one may not be able to define properly asymptotic state vectors @xmath0 in a quantum context , given that planck size black hole horizons appear as fluctuations of the geometry , and hence an asymptotic observer will necessarily trace out the information captured by the horizons .",
    "this means that the out states will be necessarily described by _ density matrices _",
    ", @xmath1 .",
    "one has therefore an evolution from pure states to mixed , and unitarity is lost .",
    "the problem in defining asymptotic state vectors also implies the impossibility of defining a proper scattering @xmath2-matrix , since the latter connects by definition `` in '' and `` out '' state vectors : @xmath3 .",
    "instead , one can only define a hawking $ -matrix  @xcite , which connects in and out mixed states described by _ density matrices _ : @xmath4 where $ @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the s - matrix , and @xmath7 the hamiltonian of the matter subsystem .",
    "the $ -matrix _ has no inverse _ , as a consequence of the loss of information encountered in the problem .",
    "this , in turn , results  @xcite in the impossibility of defining a proper cpt operator for such a system , and hence cpt symmetry is violated in its strong form .",
    "the proof is elementary but instructive , and hence we give it here for completeness .",
    "consider an initial ( @xmath8 ) density matrix , @xmath9 , which may or may not correspond to a pure state .",
    "let @xmath10 be the corresponding out state ( @xmath11 ) , which is definitely a mixed state in the case at hand ( c.f .",
    "figure [ bhfoam ] ) .",
    "assume that there exists a unitary , invertible quantum - mechanical cpt operator @xmath12 : @xmath13 from ( [ dollarmatrix ] ) , ( [ thetaope ] ) we may write : @xmath14 , from which : @xmath15.however , from ( [ dollarmatrix ] ) we can rewrite this equation in the form : @xmath16 which implies the existence of an inverse @xmath17 of the $ -matrix , which as explained above does not exist as a result of the information loss in the problem .",
    "thus , we conclude that in the black hole case of figure [ bhfoam ] , or any other case of an open quantum mechanical system with unitarity ( information ) loss , a strong form of cpt invariance _ can not hold _  @xcite .",
    "the conclusions of the previous section may be extended to cases of interest in astrophysics , involving space - time boundaries across which ( quantum ) information is lost .",
    "such a case is that of a robertson - walker expanding universe with a positive cosmological _ constant _ @xmath18 .",
    "in such a universe the density of matter scales with the scale factor @xmath19 as : @xmath20 , while the presence of a cosmological constant results in a `` vacuum energy density '' @xmath21 that remains _ constant _ , and hence eventually _ dominates _ the expansion of the universe , forcing the latter to enter a ( de sitter ) phase of exponential expansion , @xmath22 , and hence _ eternal _ acceleration .",
    "in such a case there is a _ cosmic _ horizon , i.e. a surface beyond which a cosmological observer in our universe can not see , given that the light takes infinite time to traverse the ( finite ) distance corresponding to the horizon radius @xmath23 : @xmath24 the presence of a cosmic horizon makes the case of an eternally accelerating universe with a ( positive ) cosmological constant @xmath25 somewhat similar to the black hole case of figure [ bhfoam ] .",
    "the important difference is that in the @xmath25-universe the observer lives _ inside _ the cosmic ( hubble ) horizon , in contrast to the black hole case , where the observer lives__outside _ _ the event horizon . nevertheless , in _ both _",
    "cases , one can not define proper asymptotic states , in the sense of information loss across the space - time boundary , and hence the $ matrix is non factorisable : an s - matrix can not be defined for the problem.according to the discussion in the previous section , therefore , one expects  @xcite a breaking of cpt symmetry in its strong form . in this case , we call this type of breaking _ cosmological _ , to distinguish its global nature from the microscopic black hole case of figure [ bhfoam ] , which we refer to as _ local quantum gravity _ type of cpt breaking",
    ".            it must be mentioned at this stage that current astrophysical evidence ( either by direct measurements of the acceleration of the universe using supernovae type -ia data  @xcite ( c.f . left and",
    "middle figures [ sncmb ] ) or indirect evidence from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies  @xcite ( c.f .",
    "right figure [ sncmb ] ) ) points towards a _ dark _ energy component of the universe , which covers 73% of its energy content .",
    "best - fit models to the current data are consistent with a cosmological constant @xmath25-universe  @xcite .",
    "it is physically interesting , therefore , to ask what happens with cpt invariance of a quantum field theory when placed in such universes ( global gravitational backgrounds ) . from the previous arguments  @xcite one expects",
    "cosmological breaking of the cpt theorem .",
    "an immediate question concerns the _ order of magnitude _ of such a breaking .",
    "certainly it is expected to be proportional to the cosmological constant @xmath25 , but since the latter is a dimensionful quantity the order of the associated cpt violation should depend on the specific context considered .",
    "the natural framework will be to consider the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath26 of matter in a @xmath25-universe .",
    "the analogy with open system quantum mechanics , as well as the black hole case ( c.f .",
    "fig.[bhfoam ] ) , implies the following modified evolution equation : @xmath27+\\delta h(\\rho_m ) \\label{evolution } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian of the matter subsystem , and @xmath28 is in general non linear , and expresses the interaction of the matter subsystem with the `` environment '' . in the cosmological case",
    "this environment consists of long - wavelength modes ( or parts thereof ) which lie outside the hubble cosmic horizon ( [ horizon ] ) . to leading order",
    "one may assume approximately that terms linear in @xmath26 in @xmath28 determine to a satisfactory degree the low - energy physics , accessible to particle physics experiments .",
    "then , linear evolutions of the type ( [ evolution ] ) may be restricted according to the lindblad form  @xcite : @xmath29 +   \\sum_{j}a_j \\rho_m a_j^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(a_j^\\dagger a_j \\rho   + \\rho a_j^\\dagger a_j \\right ) \\label{lindblad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath30,@xmath31 operators expressing the interaction with the environment ( the set may even be infinite ) . the form ( [ lindblad ] ) is valid upon some reasonable assumptions about positivity of @xmath26 , conservation of its trace @xmath32=const , _ etc .",
    "_ such assumptions may not be valid in some models of quantum gravity , but one may be confident that they at least characterize the cosmological constant universe under consideration . to adapt ( [ lindblad ] ) in a cosmological context",
    "one needs a specific and detailed model .",
    "one such model , to which we shall restrict our attention in this review , is provided within the framework of the so - called non - critical ( liouville ) string theory  @xcite , which - as argued in @xcite - is an appropriate framework for describing _ non - equilibrium _ string theories .",
    "the immediate question , of course , is whether the @xmath25-universe is a non equilibrium system .",
    "the answer to such a question depends on the definition of `` equilibrium '' in string theory , which should not be confused with the ` thermal ' one . in the first quantized version of strings we define  @xcite as ` equilibrium theories ' the stringy @xmath33-models whose",
    "target - space backgrounds correspond to _ conformal _ world - sheet couplings , in other words have vanishing world - sheet renormalization - group ( rg ) @xmath34-functions   in ( [ weylcoeff ] ) are the so - called weyl - anomaly coefficients and not simply the rg @xmath34-functions @xmath35 , with @xmath36 a world - sheet scale .",
    "one has : @xmath37 where @xmath38 correspond to variations of the background fields @xmath39 under target - space diffeomorphisms .",
    "for instance , for graviton backgrounds one has to @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the regge slope : @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 $ ] is a scalar function of the backgrounds . to @xmath44 , @xmath43 $ ] is the dilaton @xmath45 . ] : @xmath46 where @xmath47 correspond to correlation functions of vertex operators of the @xmath33-model , and @xmath39 are @xmath33-model couplings / target - space background fields .",
    "the theory space indices @xmath48 are raised and lowered by a specific metric to be discussed below .",
    "such equations determine specific ( conformal ) string backgrounds . as target space equations",
    ", they can be expanded in configuration space in powers of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 the string mass scale .",
    "this is a free parameter in string theory , and , thus , may be different from the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath51 gev .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath52 , in the case of a gravitational background only , the respective @xmath34-function is just the ricci tensor : @xmath53 where @xmath54 are space time indices.thus , if other backgrounds are ignored , the condition ( [ weylcoeff ] ) implies ricci flat backgrounds .",
    "such backgrounds are solutions of einstein equations , which thus reconciles general relativity with stringy conformal invariance , at least at the level of equations of motion in target space  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence is more general , given that for arbitrary backgrounds @xmath55 of a stringy @xmath33-model one can prove  @xcite a _ gradient flow _ property of the @xmath56-functions : @xmath57}{\\delta g^j}~ , \\qquad   { \\cal g}^{ij } \\equiv z^2 { \\bar z}^2 < v^i v^j>_g \\label{gradientflow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 are ( euclidean ) world - sheet coordinates , @xmath59 is the zamolodchikov ( inverse ) metric in theory space @xmath55 , and @xmath60 $ ] is a target - space diffeomorphism invariant functional of @xmath61 , playing the rle of an effective action .",
    "since , at least perturbatively in ( weak ) couplings @xmath39 , the function @xmath59 is invertible , one concludes that the conformal invariance conditions ( [ weylcoeff ] ) are , at least perturbatively in @xmath39 , _ equivalent _ to on - shell equations of motion @xmath62}{\\delta g^i } = 0 $ ] .",
    "when such on - shell conditions are satisfied we speak of ` equilibrium points ' in string theory space .",

    "this is what we consider  @xcite as a _ non - equilibrium _ case in string theory .    in the latter case , conformal invariance of the @xmath33-model",
    "may be _ restored _ by the introduction of an _ extra _",
    "@xmath33-model coordinate , the liouville field  @xcite , @xmath64 , the zero - mode of which may be viewed  @xcite as the world - sheet rg scale.the important point is that upon liouville dressing of the non - conformal vertex operators  @xcite , the stringy @xmath33-model in the extended ( ( d+1)-dimensional ) target space @xmath65 , @xmath66 is _",
    "conformal_.    a detailed analysis  @xcite , shows that near a fixed point in theory space @xmath67 ( where @xmath33-model perturbation theory is valid ) the liouville dressed  @xcite couplings @xmath68  obey the following equation : @xmath69 { \\lambda^i } ' = -\\beta^i(\\lambda^j ) \\label{liouvcond}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the world - sheet zero mode of @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the world - sheet weyl anomaly coefficient but with @xmath39 replaced by the liouville dressed couplings @xmath72 , and the minus sign in front of it is valid for _ supercritical _ string theories , i.e. for deformed @xmath33-models with the running central charge @xmath73 > 9 $ ] ( for superstrings ) , where we shall concentrate on for the purposes of this review . in this case",
    "the liouville mode has a _ time - like _ signature  @xcite , and we interpret it as target time  @xcite .",
    "a solution to order @xmath74 of ( [ liouvcond ] ) reads : @xmath75 with @xmath76 the o.p.e .",
    "appearing in the @xmath34-functions ( c.f .",
    "( [ weylcoeff ] ) ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath77 are the gravitational anomalous dimensions  @xcite , which are defined as follows : if we expand @xmath78 = q_*^2 + { \\cal o}(g^2)$ ] , where @xmath79const , then @xmath77 satisfy : @xmath80 , with @xmath81 the conformal dimension of the vertex operator corresponding to the coupling @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath82 is the anomalous dimension of this coupling under quantum ( world - sheet ) corrections .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath25-universe as a _ non - conformal _ gravitational background of a string  @xcite .",
    "the background is non - conformal since to @xmath40 the relevant einstein equation is : @xmath83 from which we observe that the relevant @xmath33-model weyl anomaly coefficient @xmath84 is non zero ( c.f .",
    "( [ ricci ] ) ) .",
    "the conventional framework in string theory is to interpret such non - vanishing contributions to the @xmath34-functions as arising from higher world - sheet topologies , e.g. _ dilaton tadpoles _ , which contribute to the ultraviolet world - sheet divergences and thus need regularization .",
    "such a regularization can be taken care of by adding appropriate counterterms at a tree level in the @xmath33-model , which are such so as to cancel the higher - genus infinities  @xcite .",
    "the problem with such an approach is the convergence of the higher - genus surface resummation , as well as the fact that if this were the mechanism for generating a cosmological constant in string theory , the resulting value should be expected on generic grounds to be of order planck ( in appropriate units ) .",
    "it would be very hard to reconcile such a mechanism with the smallness of the currently observed cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have proposed an alternative approach , which allows for _ relaxation _ mechanisms to be employed in string theory , based on the above - described liouville string approach . according to the latter",
    ", we may view the @xmath25-universe as a non - critical @xmath33-model which needs liouville dressing .",
    "the origin of the non - criticality in this approach is an issue that can be dealt with in the context of detailed models  @xcite , which we shall not describe here . for our purposes we only mention that departure from conformality",
    "may be induced , for instance , by cosmically _ catastrophic _",
    "events , such as the collision of two _ brane _ worlds  @xcite .",
    "the non - critical @xmath33-model in such a case represents stringy matter excitations on the brane corresponding to the observable world , and the initial central charge deficit is nothing other than the effective potential between the two branes when they are closed to each other ( soon after the collision ) .",
    "the latter can then be computed by perturbative methods via the exchange of pairs of open strings stretched between the branes .",
    "we note at this stage that the advantage of this approach is that now higher genus world - sheet or other effects may generate planck size cosmological constant , which , however , upon appropriate liouville dressing results in _ relaxing _ to zero vacuum energy density , once the liouville mode is _ identified _ with the cosmological _ target time _  @xcite .",
    "this identification constraints the dynamics of the @xmath85-dimensional space time on a d - dimensional hypersurface .",
    "it is important to notice that in cases of physical interest  @xcite such a constraint is obtained _ dynamically _ , as corresponding to _ minimization _ of an appropriate effective potential in the @xmath86-dimensional target space .    upon this identification",
    ", one can show  @xcite that the time evolution of a matter density matrix @xmath26 , propagating in such non - critical string backgrounds , has the form : @xmath87 + : \\beta^i(\\lambda )   { \\cal g}_{ij } [ \\lambda^j , \\rho_m ] : \\label{liouvevoldm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the matter low - energy hamiltonian , and the @xmath89 denote appropriate normal ordering of the quantum operators @xmath90  -model perturbation theory , target - space _ canonical _ quantization is achieved formally upon summing up world - sheet topologies  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the helmholtz conditions for canonical quantization in liouville @xmath33-models are preserved upon the identification of time with the liouville mode . ] . in this sense",
    ", one may view the various partitions of the operator @xmath91 , which is expanded in powers of @xmath90 , as expressing the various lindblad `` environmental '' operators for the liouville string .",
    "the presence of the environment is manifested through the non - vanishing @xmath63 , and is attributed to the fact that the set of the background couplings @xmath39 considered in the deformed @xmath33-model at hand is _ not a complete one_. in concrete examples  @xcite including black hole and other singular backgrounds in string theory , such as colliding branes , one may indeed identify @xmath33-models in which _ exactly marginal _ deformation operators may be constructed , which however involve either _ non - propagating _ or , in general , _ inaccessible to local scattering experiments _ solitonic gravitational degrees of freedom . truncating the theory to the local degrees of freedom accessible to low - energy experiments",
    ", then , defines an _ effective non - critical _ ( liouville ) string theory .     in a non - critical @xmath33-model .",
    "the curve lies in the complexified world - sheet area @xmath92 plane . upon the identification of the liouville mode with the target time this contour becomes similar to closed time like paths in open ( non - equilibrium ) field theories , and leads to non factorisable $ -matrices , @xmath93 , due to world - sheet ultraviolet infinities ( in the region @xmath94 ) . ]",
    "the presence of the non - hamiltonian terms in ( [ liouvevoldm ] ) , proportional to @xmath63 , implies _ breaking _ of cpt symmetry in target space , due to the fact that , in general , a proper s - matrix can not be defined in liouville strings  @xcite .",
    "this stems from a steepest - descent contour over which one defines the liouville - mode path integral in a @xmath33-model  @xcite ( c.f .",
    "figure [ steepest ] ) .",
    "the non - factorisability of the $ -matrix , @xmath93 , and hence the ill - definition of a proper scattering amplitude , in such cases is due to ultraviolet divergences in the small - world - sheet - area limit  @xcite . on the other hand , in the infrared limit , @xmath95 , the critical string situation , with a well - defined s - matrix",
    ", is recovered .",
    "the above observations follow formally from considering infinitesimal world - sheet weyl transformations of correlation functions of vertex operators  @xcite .",
    "let an n - point correlator , @xmath96 , of a liouville @xmath33-model , on a world - sheet with metric @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and consider an infinitesimal weyl transformation @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "after some straightforward computations one obtains  @xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath92 is the world - sheet area ( in a ` fixed - a ' @xmath33-model formalism  @xcite ) , @xmath102 is the central charge deficit of the non - critical string , and the @xmath103 s are the gravitational anomalous dimensions of the various couplings corresponding to the vertex operators @xmath104 .",
    "notice that the first term on the right hand side of ( [ weylshift ] ) is independent of the area @xmath92 , and transforms covariantly under weyl shifts .",
    "this is the term that survives the critical string limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the second set of terms transform _ anomalously _ , proportionally to the sum of the liouville anomalous dimensions and the central charge deficit , and hence are _ exclusive _ to the liouville nature of the @xmath33-model .",
    "such terms _ vanish _ only in the critical case , or in the _ infrared _ limit @xmath95 , where the non - critical string approaches a critical - string _ equilibrium _ situation  @xcite .",
    "notice also that due to the presence of these @xmath105-terms , there are ultraviolet world - sheet divergences in the region @xmath94 , which , result in an ill - defined scattering amplitude . in a critical string theory such @xmath92-dependent terms are absent , and hence the correlator has a well - defined meaning as a scattering amplitude . on the other hand , if one defines the liouville - mode - path - integrated correlator @xmath106 on the regularizing contour of fig .",
    "[ steepest ] , such divergences are regularized , but , as mentioned earlier , the resulting expression is identified with a $ -matrix element , rather than a scattering amplitude  @xcite . in this context , the world - sheet divergences may thus be held responsible for the _ non factorisability _ of the $ -matrix to a product of proper scattering amplitudes .",
    "the lack of this property , implies , then , according to the arguments of @xcite reviewed above , a violation of cpt symmetry , at least in its strong form . from ( [ liouvevoldm ] )",
    "we observe that this violation if proportional to @xmath56 . in the cosmological case of the @xmath25-universe under consideration",
    "the non - criticality is determined primarily by the graviton @xmath34-function ( [ ricci ] ) , which in turn implies that the cpt - breaking terms in the evolution equation ( [ liouvevoldm ] ) are of order ( in , say , gev ) : @xmath107 if one identifies @xmath108 with @xmath109 , with @xmath51 gev , the four - dimensional planck scale , and takes into account the current observational limits of @xmath110 , then the cosmological cpt violating terms in ( [ liouvcpt ] ) are of order less than @xmath111 gev .",
    "this is too small to be detected in current or immediate future particle physics experiments , such as neutral kaon facilities  @xcite , which are considered as sensitive probes of tests of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "however , from our considerations above , it follows that astrophysical observations , either through supernovae  @xcite or through cmb precision observations  @xcite , exhibit sensitivity that reach such small scales indirectly , and hence once the presence of a cosmological constant is confirmed in the future , this may be considered also as an indirect observation of an induced cosmological cpt violation , in the sense defined above .",
    "in general , within a quantum - gravity ( qg ) context , the lindblad type violation of cpt implied by evolution equations of the form ( [ lindblad ] ) , or ( [ liouvevoldm ] ) may be tested in particle physics neutral meson experiments such as neutral kaons  @xcite , given that quantum gravity induced _ local _ violations of unitarity , due to processes involving fluctuating microscopic black holes ( c.f .",
    "figure [ bhfoam ] ) may be much larger than the above - mentioned global effects ( [ liouvcpt ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that such local effects do not necessarily have the time - attenuation factor that characterizes the above - mentioned relaxation models of the cosmological constant .",
    "for instance , consider the case of a string propagating in a black hole background . as",
    "explained in @xcite , in this case the violation of world - sheet conformal invariance is due to interactions with the foam , as a result of the truncation of the set of background fields to propagating degrees of freedom only .    in other words , the coefficients @xmath112 in ( [ weylcoeff ] ) , which would vanish identically if the set of couplings were complete ( exactly marginal deformations ) , are now different from zero by terms corresponding to massive string states ( with masses which are multiples of @xmath50 , the string mass scale ) .",
    "the latter are either non - propagating d.o.f . or solitonic states inaccessible in principle to local scattering experiments , such as global bohm - aharonov phases of matter wave functions induced by the quantum gravity singular metric fluctuations  @xcite . in this case one can expect @xmath112 to be expanded in a power series of @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is an ( invariant ) four - momentum scale , since only closed string scattering amplitudes correspond to gravitational degrees of freedom  @xcite  . ] .",
    "unless prevented by special reasons , which are not expected in general , the series starts from @xmath115 , which in a lorentz invariant theory is of order @xmath116 , where @xmath117 a characteristic ( rest ) mass scale in the problem .",
    "this is the order of the @xmath34-functions appearing in ( [ liouvevoldm ] ) , and hence in such a case one would have : @xmath118 as mentioned above , the string mass scale @xmath50 may or may not be equal to the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath51 gev .",
    "thus , if such a situation is actually encountered in nature , the associated cpt breaking effects are much larger than the cosmological effects ( [ liouvcpt ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in these examples the conformal invariance is violated at tree level in a world - sheet genus expansion , due to a truncation of the spectrum .",
    "if the violation occurs at higher genera , as could be the case of a more conventional violation due to graviton loops in a field - theory context , then one expects in that case a further suppression of ( [ liouvqgcpt ] ) by an extra factor @xmath119 , i.e. one has cpt - violating terms of order @xmath120 .",
    "such effects may then be bounded ( or tested ! ) experimentally by taking into account that their presence may induce decoherence and oscillations in , say , neutral mesons  @xcite , neutrinos  @xcite _ etc._. we shall discuss first the neutral meson case , concentrating on the most sensitive probe that of neutral kaons .",
    "the qg induced oscillations are between kaon and its antiparticle @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "the modified evolution equation for the respective density matrices of neutral kaon matter in the _ linearized _ approximation , ( [ lindblad ] ) or ( [ liouvevoldm ] ) , can be parametrized as follows  @xcite : @xmath122 + \\delta\\h \\rho~,\\ ] ] where @xmath123 and @xmath124 positivity of @xmath125 requires : @xmath126 .",

    "the other asymmetries may be studied in a similar fashion .",
    "details can be given in @xcite , where we refer the interested reader for details .",
    "experimentally , the best available bounds at present come from cplear measurements  @xcite @xmath163 , which are not much different from theoretically expected values @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the kaon rest mass .",
    "one may extend the above formalism to study correlated kaon states , as those produced in a @xmath166 decay  @xcite , @xmath167 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in such cases the non - quantum mechanical terms in ( [ lindblad ] ) produce terms that apparently violate energy and angular momentum , at a microscopic level , and this is consistent with generic properties of the formalism  @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed though that the formalism remains still an open issue , given that the evolution of correlated states may require genuine two - particle state variables for the non - quantum mechanical parts , whilst in @xcite one used only single - particle variables @xmath127 .",
    "an additional point is the validity of the requirement of _ complete positivity _ of the reduced density matrix of the correlated kaon states  @xcite , which would impose further restrictions on the set of the qg decoherence parameters .",
    "however , in view of potential _ non - linearities _ of quantum gravity , or other mean - field effects , it is not clear whether such a requirement actually holds  @xcite .",
    "such issues present interesting challenges for the theory .    finally , when the above - described formalism of open quantum systems  @xcite is applied to neutrinos , induced oscillations between neutrino flavours may occur as a result of decoherence  @xcite , which may be independent of neutrino masses .",
    "fitting currently available data from atmospheric and solar neutrinos  @xcite one may obtain sensitivities which exceed the planck scale by far .",
    "for instance , concentrating on the qg - decoherence - induced transition probability @xmath168 , and _ assuming _ that the dissipative environmental ( qg ) effects are of order @xmath169 where @xmath170 is an average neutrino energy , the authors of @xcite estimated the decoherence effects to be smaller than @xmath171 gev , implying an effective qg scale for massless neutrino much larger than @xmath172 for @xmath173 gev energies . on the other hand , an earlier analysis  @xcite by means of the super - kamiokande data  @xcite for @xmath174 oscillations yields a somewhat weaker bound for the qg - decoherence effects @xmath175 gev in the massive neutrino case , using the super kamiokande value  @xcite for the neutrino squared mass difference @xmath176 ev@xmath177 between the oscillating states . in the massless neutrino case , the analysis of @xcite yields more stringent bounds for the decoherence parameter(s ) , of order @xmath171 gev , as in @xcite",
    "however , theoretically , for massive neutrino models of decoherence , more conservative estimates have been presented for _ some models _",
    "@xcite according to which the decoherence parameters are of order @xmath178 which is much more pessimistic than ( [ optimistic ] ) , and is probably not detectable at immediate future facilities .",
    "the situation is far from being conclusive , however , as it depends on the details of the qg environment and its interaction with the subsystem  @xcite .",
    "a comment we would like to make concerns the presence of energies @xmath179 in both estimates ( [ optimistic ] ) and ( [ pessim ] ) , which makes them appropriate only for _ non lorentz invariant _ formulations . for lorentz invariant ( li ) cases one would expect only rest mass terms to appear , for instance ( [ pessim ] ) could be replaced by @xmath180 in minimal suppression models _ etc .",
    "_ for _ massless _ neutrinos the li formulation is tricky , as one lacks a fundamental low - energy mass scale . some steps towards li decoherence are taken in @xcite , where a li decoherence has been defined in terms of _ intrinsic quantum mechanical uncertainties _ of spatial translations , like the ones entering the generalized uncertainty principle in string theory  @xcite .",
    "however , in our opinion , the issue remains a challenging open one .",
    "the above discussion assumed that lorentz invariance is maintained by quantum gravity .",
    "this may not be the case in certain backgrounds , for instance those involving _ spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry _ by means of certain tensor quantities acquiring vacuum expectation values  @xcite , @xmath181 , which may characterize some string theory backgrounds .",
    "another set of models with potential lorentz violations are loop quantum gravity models  @xcite , as well as approaches to quantum gravity viewing the planck length as a ` real length '  @xcite , for which the requirement of not being subjected to lorentz contraction leads to modified dispersion relations for matter probes , including photons , already in flat minkowski space times .",
    "the breaking of lorentz symmetry violates the requirement ( ii ) of the cpt theorem stated in the introduction , and hence leads to a breaking of cpt symmetry of the associated field theory .    in such models",
    "one may encounter situations in which the violations of lorentz invariance ( liv ) and , hence , cpt , are _ minimally _ suppressed by a single power of the planck mass scale , @xmath182  gev ( or , in general , a qg scale , @xmath183 , which may be different from @xmath172 ) , and are typically of order @xmath184 where @xmath179 is a typical energy scale of the matter probe , in the frame of observation .",
    "we must note here that as a result of liv there is a _ frame dependence _ of the results , and probably a preferred frame , which may be taken to be the cmb frame ( but this may not the only possibility ) .",
    "the basic formalism is described in @xcite , where one considers _",
    "modified dirac equation ( mde ) _ for fermions in the so - called standard model extension ( sme ) . in view of the recent ` massive ' production of antihydrogen ( @xmath185 ) at cern @xcite , which implies that interesting direct tests of cpt invariance using @xmath185 are to be expected in the near future , we consider for our purposes here the specific case of mde for hydrogen @xmath7 ( anti - hydrogen @xmath185 ) , although the formalism is generic .",
    "let the spinor @xmath186 represent the electron ( positron ) with charge @xmath187 around a proton ( antiproton ) of charge @xmath188 .",
    "then the mde reads : @xmath189 where @xmath190 , @xmath191 coulomb potential .",
    "the parameters @xmath192 induce cpt and lorentz violation , while the parameters @xmath193 induce lorentz violation only .    in sme models",
    "there are energy shifts between states @xmath194 , with @xmath195 denoting electronic ( nuclear ) angular momenta .",
    "using perturbation theory , one finds  @xcite : @xmath196 where @xmath197 electron ; @xmath198 proton .",
    "the corresponding results for antihydrogen ( @xmath185 ) are obtained upon : @xmath199    one may study the spectroscopy of _ forbidden transitions 1s-2s _ : if cpt and lorentz violating parameters are constant they drop out to leading order energy shifts in free h ( @xmath200 .",
    "subleading effects are then suppressed by the square of the fine structure constant : @xmath201 , specifically : @xmath202 .",
    "this is too small to be seen .",
    "but what about the case where atoms of @xmath7 ( or @xmath185 ) are in magnetic traps ?",
    "magnetic fields induce hyperfine zeeman splittings in 1s , 2s states .",
    "there are four spin states , mixed under the the magnetic field b ( @xmath203 basis ) : @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , where @xmath208 .",

    "the existence of a preferred frame implies very stringent restrictions on such liv and cptv terms , most of which stem from observations ( both terrestrial and astrophysical ) pertaining to _ electrically charged _",
    "fermions  @xcite .",
    "these observations seem to exclude qg - induced _ minimally suppressed ( linear ) _ modifications of matter dispersion relations , given that the sensitivity of such experiments exceeds the planck scale @xmath216 gev by several orders of magnitude , and hence such models are excluded on naturalness grounds .",
    "for instance , one of the most stringent constraints at present on linearly modified electron dispersion relations is obtained from observations of the synchrotron radiation from crab nebula  @xcite , with sensitivity that exceeds @xmath51 gev by nine orders of magnitude .",
    "also , one may obtain high sensitivities in atomic and nuclear physics experiments  @xcite .",
    "a summary of the various sensitivities from atomic physics experiments is given in the table of figure [ bluhm ]  @xcite , where we can see that in some cases cpt and liv violating terms for electrons ( or electrically charged fermions ) may reach sensitivities up to @xmath217 gev !",
    "although from the above discussion it seems that current experiments exhibit sensitivities that exclude linearly modified dispersion relations , however the actual situation may be more subtle .",
    "in fact , we shall argue below that in a liouville string approach to foam , there is a _ violation _ of the _ equivalence principle _ in the sense that not all matter probes interact the same way with the gravitational foamy backgrounds . in particular , photons , or at most particles _ neutral _ under the ( unbroken ) standard model gauge group @xmath218 , are the only types that may exhibit modified dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the low - energy modes are insensitive to the quantum gravity foamy effects , as far as dispersion relations are concerned .",
    "a concrete model of liouville string foam with this property has been presented in @xcite . according to this model",
    "our world is a three brane , and the observable matter particles ( including radiation ) are viewed as open string excitations on it , with their ends attached to the brane .",
    "the brane is embedded in a higher ( bulk ) space time in which only closed strings ( gravitational d.o.f . ) are allowed to propagate .",
    "the foam is obtained by assuming quantum fluctuations of the brane world which are such that ( virtual ) d - particle defects can emerge from the brane .",
    "these are short - lived excitations , with average life time @xmath219 ( where @xmath108 is the string length , and @xmath220 the speed of light in empty space ) .",
    "the d - particles are degenerate forms ( point - like ) of d - branes  @xcite , but as their higher - dimensional counterparts they can _ capture _ open strings , since the latter may have their ends attached to the d - particle . from a conformal field theory point of view the capture stage",
    "may be described by the following @xmath33-model deformations  @xcite @xmath221 where @xmath222 denotes the location of the d - particle on the d3 brane world , and @xmath223 , denotes the recoil velocity ( proportional to the momentum transfer ) , with @xmath224 the string coupling , and @xmath50 the string mass scale .",
    "the parameter @xmath225 regulates the heaviside operator @xmath226 .",
    "it can be shown that the pair of deformations ( [ logpair ] ) closes to form a _",
    "logarithmic conformal _ algebra ( lcft ) , provided @xmath227 is identified with the logarithm of the world - sheet rg scale .",
    "such lcft lie in the border line between conformal algebras and general two - dimensional field theories .",
    "the operators ( [ logpair ] ) are _ marginally relevant _ in a world - sheet rg sense , with anomalous dimensions @xmath228 .",
    "this has important implications for the departure of the deformed @xmath33-model from the conformal point , hence the need for liouville dressing  @xcite .",
    "this dressing results in the appearance of non trivial metric deformations in space time , which physically are interpreted as a back reaction of the recoiling d - particle , during the capture stage , onto the neighboring space time .",
    "the resulting metric assumes the form ( asymptotically in time after the capture stage )  @xcite : @xmath229 this change in the space time background , during every interaction of the matter probe with the d - particle , causes a _ modification _ in the dispersion relation of the probe , as a result of the relation : @xmath230 it should be stressed that this modification is consistent with the general coordinate diffeomorphism invariance of the target space of the stringy @xmath33-model , which is respected by the foam . from ( [ moddis ] )",
    "it is evident that in this way one obtains _ linear _ modifications in the dispersion relations , and hence such models , if valid for electrically charged fermions , would have been excluded in the sense of yielding @xmath231 gev .",
    "we stress that only the _ subluminal _ branch of the modifications in the dispersion relation is consistent with the capture stage  @xcite , and in fact it is only such modifications that are allowed by the string dynamics  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , of course , one could still save such models by adjusting @xmath50 or @xmath224 appropriately so as to meet such sensitivities , but then one probably faces a naturalness problem , in that one should explain why this particular model of foam is characterized by such small @xmath224 ( assuming @xmath232 ) .",
    "fortunately for the model of @xcite there seems to be a _",
    "way out _ , which in fact is based on _ gauge symmetry principles_.",
    "the point is that the capture of an open string by a d - particle has been shown in @xcite to describe @xmath233 gauge excitations , whose dynamics is described by a born - infeld ( bi ) effective lagrangian @xmath234 , with @xmath235 the @xmath233 maxwell field strength , and @xmath236 the background metric . in general",
    ", @xmath237 coincident @xmath86-particles exchanging open strings stretched between them , will transform according to the adjoint representation of the @xmath238 group , and obey a non abelian bi action  @xcite .",
    "this includes also the recoil case  @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that the capture / recoil of open strings from a group of @xmath237 d - particle excitations in the foam will result in gauge excitations on the d3 brane world .",
    "there is no way of obtaining other excitations , transforming for instance according to the fundamental representation of the group . for the latter to happen",
    "one needs _ intersecting _ brane configurations at angles @xmath239  @xcite , the latter serving to define appropriate chirality for fermionic excitations .",
    "d - particles are by definition parallel among themselves , and one can not thus get chiral fermions by exchanging strings among them , a process characterizing the capture / recoil case .    given that in a space - time foam model the quantum numbers of the ` vacuum ' must be preserved  @xcite by the interactions of matter with the foam d.o.f . , we must conclude from the above considerations that only string modes which transform in the adjoint representation of the ( unbroken ) standard model group @xmath240 , and are therefore gauge excitations , can interact in the above sense with the d - particles and have modified dispersion relations of the type ( [ moddis ] ) .",
    "the above result holds at _ tree level _ in a world - sheet formalism . from a world sheet view point",
    "the capture of the open string or closed string by a d - particle implies either changes in the boundary conditions of the open string ( from neumann ( n ) to dirichlet ( d )  @xcite ) , or splitting of the closed string to a pair of open ones , with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "a natural question arises in connection with higher world - sheet topologies , for instance one loop ( annulus ) world - sheet graphs",
    ". such loops may express , for instance , self energy parts of electrons .",
    "such quantum corrections involve propagating photons ( and other ( actually , an infinity of ) string excitations ) , and one may expect that these will interact with the d - particles of the foam . the issue as to the precise effects of these loop calculations on the self energy of the electrons and other charged fermions is under investigation .",
    "this may also depend on the complicated dynamics of the ( yet unknown ) m - theory that describes such defects .",
    "such issues deserve further study before conclusions are reached .",
    "the above considerations exclude electrons , and other electrically charged fermions ( e.g. quarks ) from being captured by the d - particle ( at tree level at least ) , given that the capture of such excitations by the d - particle would lead to violations of electric charge  @xcite .",
    "thus , modulo higher order string - loop effects , the most stringent constraints on the linear modifications of the dispersion relations , which are based on such fermions  @xcite , are evaded in the liouville string model of @xcite . on the other hand , _ photons _ ( and probably gluons  ) , _ can _ interact with d - particles _ at tree level in @xmath33-model perturbation theory _",
    ", thereby exhibiting linearly modified dispersion relations and _ subluminal _ refractive indices ( the subluminal nature is due to the born - infeld electrodynamics  @xcite ) .",
    "such effects can be tested by @xmath241-ray burst studies ( grb ) of the arrival times of photons , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of such experiments , at present , is such that the qg effective scale for photons exhibiting linear dispersion relations ( [ moddis ] ) is @xmath242 gev  @xcite . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "the interaction of a photon excitation with a d - particle is accompanied by a _ random phase _",
    "@xcite of the re - emitted photon after the capture stage .",
    "such an effect also invalidates claims made in @xcite for excluding linear modifications in the photon dispersion relations  .",
    "it is evident from the above considerations that _ details _ in the _ dynamics _ of _ space - time foam _ do _ matter _ in discussing the pertinent phenomenology .",
    "many conclusions , based on generic arguments from our experience so far with ordinary local quantum field theories , may be misleading when applied to quantum gravity .",
    "a final topic we would like to discuss briefly is the violation of cpt in the neutrino sector of the theory .",
    "the reason why we chose to discuss this topic in a separate section is the relatively recent claims from the lsnd experiment  @xcite on evidence for observation of oscillations in the antineutrino sector @xmath243 , but the absence of such oscillation in the corresponding neutrino sector   hint for @xmath244 decreased to 0.6@xmath33 , while the signal for antineutrino oscillations remained . ] .",
    "the situation will be clarified experimentally , when experiments looking directly for @xmath245 , will be in operation , like miniboonne  @xcite  .",
    "if one associates oscillations with dirac mass terms for neutrinos , then the lsnd result  @xcite , if correct , points towards cpt violation in the sense of an antineutrino dirac mass being much higher than a neutrino one , the mass difference between neutrino and antineutrino being of the order of 1 ev .",
    "this idea was put forward first in @xcite in a purely phenomenological setting ( c.f .",
    "[ cptvmassnu ] ) , in an attempt to explain the lsnd anomaly  @xcite without invoking a _ sterile _ neutrino .",
    "there are many microscopic theories which could lead to such violations .",
    "one obvious one is the spontaneous violation of lorentz symmetry , along the lines of the sme  @xcite , described briefly above , whose applications to the massive neutrino physics has been discussed recently in @xcite .    on the other hand , in the liouville model of d - particle foam of @xcite , neutrinos may not have modified dispersion relations , as their capture stage by d - particles would not seem to respect the gauge quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "we remind the reader that neutrinos , viewed as open string excitations on the brane , transform in the fundamental representation of appropriate gauge groups , while a string - d - particle ` composite ' , describing the capture stage , behaves as a gauge field excitation in the model , transforming in the adjoint representation of the unbroken standard model group  . however , in other models of qg , where gravitational fluctuations imply the existence of an ` environment '  @xcite neutrinos may have non trivial refractive indices ( for the massless species ) . such modifications ,",
    "as we discussed in previous sections , may lead to cptv and liv effects of order @xmath246 , where @xmath179 is a typical neutrino energy at the frame of observation .",
    "such terms seem to be much smaller than the suggested neutrino - antineutrino squared mass difference of @xmath247 to explain the lsnd anomaly  @xcite .",
    "a more radical approach has been suggested earlier in @xcite , according to which the neutrino sector of the standard model exhibits _ non local _",
    "interactions among the neutrinos , responsible for the generation of cpt violating but lorentz invariant mass spectra for neutrinos , fitting phenomenologically the lsnd results .",
    "specifically , the model invokes a dirac - like theory of neutrinos ( called `` homeotic '' ) with _ both _ positive ( + ) and negative ( - ) energies , in which the spinors are described by : @xmath248 where @xmath186 are the fermionic _ dirac _",

    "however _ locality _ is relaxed , and hence cpt .",
    "we stress once again that in this scenario the neutrino masses are of _ dirac _ type .",
    "an open issue , of course , of such scenaria for neutrino cptv mass spectra is what singles out the neutrino sector from the rest of the standard model so as to produce mass differences of the order of the lsnd anomaly .",

    "as already mentioned , stringent bounds on such non quantum mechanical qg - induced decoherence parameters have been derived for the neutrino sector  @xcite , which are much smaller than the corresponding bounds in the kaon sector  @xcite .",

    "<S> i discuss various ways in which cpt symmetry may be violated , and their phenomenology in current or immediate future experimental facilities , both terrestrial and astrophysical . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , i discuss first violations of cpt symmetry due to the impossibility of defining a scattering matrix as a consequence of the existence of microscopic or macroscopic space - time boundaries , such as planck - scale black - hole ( event ) horizons , or cosmological horizons due to the presence of a ( positive ) cosmological constant in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> second , i discuss cpt violation due to breaking of lorentz symmetry , which may characterize certain approaches to quantum gravity , and third , i describe models of cpt non invariance due to violations of locality of interactions . in each of the above categories i discuss experimental sensitivities . </S>",
    "<S> i argue that the majority of lorentz - violating cases of cpt breaking , with minimal ( linear ) suppression by the planck - mass scale , are already excluded by current experimental tests . </S>",
    "<S> there are however some ( stringy ) models which can evade these constraints . </S>"
