    "the most useful diagnostics for probing how the galaxy has formed lie in the relationship between metal abundances [ fe / h ] and orbital eccentricities @xmath1 of stars ( e.g. freeman 1987 ; majewski 1993 ) .",
    "for example , if the galaxy underwent a monolithic , rapid collapse , the orbits of stars which have formed from free - falling gas clouds were made highly eccentric in the course of a rapid change of the galactic mass concentration .",
    "the aftermath of collapse therefore prohibits the existence of metal - poor stars having nearly circular orbits . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mass concentration occurred slowly in a manner of either a quasi - static contraction or merging / accretion of numerous fragments , some fraction of metal - poor stars are inevitably expected to hold nearly circular orbits , where the eccentricities have been approximately preserved up to the present epoch .",
    "however , our knowledge of the galactic past remains still far from reaching general consensus since the pioneering work by eggen , lynden - bell & sandage ( 1962 , hereafter referred to as els ) .",
    "els showed , based on the kinematically selected sample of stars , the evidence supporting the picture of a rapid galaxy collapse from their finding of a strong correlation between [ fe / h ] and @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , yoshii & saio ( 1979 ) and norris , bessell & pickles ( 1985 , nbp ) demonstrated the existence of low-@xmath1 , low-[fe / h ] stars , and argued that the els result is an artifact of selecting metal - poor stars having high eccentricities .",
    "this divergence of the results stems from how well the existing systematics are controlled when selecting the samples for the analysis .",
    "in particular , the systematic biases inherent in the samples either create or diminish a correlation between [ fe / h ] and @xmath1 of stars in a non - trivial manner that the picture for the initial contraction of the galaxy is drastically changed .",
    "it has recently been claimed that a non - negligible fraction of low-@xmath1 , low-[fe / h ] red giants obtained by nbp are dropped out because of their underestimated calibration of [ fe / h ] ( twarog & anthony - twarog 1994 ; ryan & lambert 1995 ) . in figure  1(a ) , we reproduce their result on the relation between [ fe / h ] and planar @xmath1 projected onto the galactic plane , for dwarfs ( crosses ) and red giants ( filled symbols ) , where the revised [ fe / h ] for the latter stars are used if they are available from either anthony - twarog & twarog ( 1994 , att ) or ryan & lambert ( 1995 ) .",
    "it is suggested that the revision for [ fe / h ] of some red giants turns out to decrease a number of low-@xmath1 , low-[fe / h ] stars , thereby weakens the conclusion by nbp .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we attempt to settle this longstanding issue based on the mostly unbiased sample of stars , together with a devised technique for analyzing the orbital distribution of stars",
    ". our sample stars , which contain metal - deficient red giants and rr lyrae variables in the vicinity of the sun , are expected to provide precise chemo - kinematical properties of old stellar populations compared to those used by els and nbp , for the reasons of their selection without kinematic bias and of their well - determined metal abundances and distances from recently revised spectro - photometric calibrations ( att ; layden 1994 ; layden 1996 ) .",
    "further advantage of using these sample stars is offered by their homogeneity in the data of proper motions which are accurately measured by the hipparcos satellite ( esa 1997 ) , and their insensitivity to the effects of metal accretion due to encounters with interstellar clouds because of their deep convection zone ( yoshii 1981 ) . in order to clarify the global orbital properties of these metal - poor stars in the galactic space , we adopt , in contrast to most of previous studies , a realistic , three - dimensional galactic potential ( sommer - larsen & zhen 1990 ) which allows us to establish the three - dimensional orbital motions of stars in conjunction with their metal abundances .",
    "the extensive analyses and results are reported elsewhere ( chiba & yoshii 1997 ) .",
    "we have selected 122 red giants from the kinematically unbiased sample of metal - deficient red giants surveyed by bond ( 1980 ) , and 124 rr lyraes from the catalogues of variable stars compiled by kukarkin ( 1969 - 1976 ) .",
    "the proper motions of the sample stars have been observed by the hipparcos satellite accurate to @xmath7 mas / yr , which were allocated to the senior author s proposal submitted in 1982 .",
    "the radial velocities and their errors are assembled from a number of published works .",
    "the data on distances and metallicities are taken from the spectro - photometric studies by att for 188 red giants and bond ( 1980 ) for other 4 red giants , and by layden ( 1994 ; 1995 ) for all rr lyraes .",
    "the full listing of all data and literatures that we have used will appear in chiba & yoshii ( 1997 ) . a majority of the sample stars are located within about 2 kpc from the sun and have metallicities [ fe / h ] less than @xmath9 dex .",
    "we note that the distribution of their metallicities in the range of [ fe / h]@xmath0 is in good agreement with the likely true metallicity distribution of halo derived from subdwarf stars ( laird et al .",
    "1988 ) .    for the purpose of enlightening the orbital properties of these stars combined with their metallicities ,",
    "we calculate the eccentricities @xmath1 of orbits by assuming a galactic potential .",
    "we adopt the three - dimensional stckel - type potential constructed by sommer - larsen & zhen ( 1990 ) which reproduces well the mass model of bahcall , schmidt & soneira ( 1982 ) . since orbits with this potential",
    "are generally not closed , we arbitrarily define @xmath1 as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the apogalactic and perigalactic distances , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that use of other axisymmetric potentials does not modify the essential results explained below .    in figure  1(b )",
    ", we plot the relation between [ fe / h ] and @xmath1 for rr lyraes ( open circles ) and red giants ( filled circles ) .",
    "it is apparent that while the stars with [ fe / h]@xmath13 have nearly circular orbits with @xmath14 , those with [ fe / h]@xmath0 have a diverse range in orbital eccentricities , i.e. there is no correlation between [ fe / h ] and @xmath1 . even for [ fe / h]@xmath2 ,",
    "about 16% of stars have @xmath15 .",
    "the primary reasons for the change from figure  1(a ) include : ( 1 ) sampling the stars almost completely in accord with the halo s metallicity distribution , especially those for [ fe / h]@xmath2 , whereas the number of such metal - poor stars in nbp is insufficient , and ( 2 ) adopting a more realistic , three - dimensional galactic potential including a massive halo in order to properly take into account their large vertical velocities above and below the galactic plane ( see figure  3 below ) , whereas @xmath1 based on a two - dimensional potential adopted by els and nbp is overestimated ( yoshii & saio 1979 ) less than 0.1 .",
    "this selection of stars however creates an extra bias in the sample ( twarog & anthony - twarog 1994 ; chiba & yoshii 1997 ) . ] .",
    "we note that the diverse @xmath1 distribution for [ fe / h]@xmath2 is not affected by the systematic underestimation of [ fe / h ] for metal - rich stars with disk - like kinematics ( see twarog & anthony - twarog 1994 for details ) .",
    "it has been discussed by recent workers that low-@xmath1 , low-[fe / h ] stars may belong to the metal - weak tail of the rapidly rotating thick disk which dominates at [ fe / h]@xmath16 to @xmath9 ( nbp ; beers & sommer - larsen 1995 ) .",
    "if this is the case , many low-@xmath1 stars in the [ fe / h]-@xmath1 diagram ought to disappear when we restrict to the larger height from the galactic plane than the scale height of the thick disk with @xmath7 kpc ( freeman 1987 ) . in figure  1(b ) , the domain enclosed by dotted lines shows where low-@xmath1 stars are selectively excluded at @xmath5 kpc .",
    "it is clear that in the intermediate metallicity range of @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath17 , the thick disk overlaps with the halo at @xmath6 , but this metal - weak tail of the disk does not extend down to [ fe / h]@xmath2 .",
    "we have found that such a division between the halo and thick disk components at [ fe / h]@xmath18 is rather sharp ( chiba & yoshii 1997 ) .    the above indication that low-@xmath1 stars in the range of [ fe / h]@xmath2 belong to the halo component is also supported from the following analysis of orbital distributions .",
    "figure  2(a ) and ( b ) show the cumulative @xmath1 distributions of orbits @xmath19 for [ fe / h]@xmath2 and @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "various histograms show how the distribution changes when we set limits on the range of the height @xmath3 . for [ fe / h]@xmath2 ,",
    "the overall @xmath1 distribution of stars remains essentially unchanged with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "thus the stars in the range of [ fe / h]@xmath2 belong to the halo component , where a non - negligible fraction ( @xmath20% ) of stars have nearly circular orbits with @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of low-@xmath1 stars in the range of @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath17 shows a sharp drop at @xmath21 kpc and then remains unchanged at higher @xmath3 [ figure  2(b ) ] .",
    "this suggests that the stars with these intermediate metallicities are contaminated with the thick disk component with a scale height of @xmath7 kpc , except for those stars having high @xmath1 at high @xmath3 .",
    "the halo is thus well separated from other disk components if we set the restriction @xmath5 kpc .    figure  3 further presents the distribution of vertical velocities @xmath22 above and below the galactic plane for [ fe / h]@xmath2 ( panel @xmath23 ) and @xmath24[fe / h]@xmath17 ( panel @xmath25 ) . dotted lines correspond to a typical vertical velocity dispersion ( @xmath26 km s@xmath27 ) of the thick disk ( beers & sommer - larsen 1995 ) .",
    "the figure virtually demonstrates that low-@xmath1 stars with [ fe / h]@xmath2 have much larger @xmath28 than expected from the thick disk , whereas some fraction of low-@xmath1 stars with @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath17 are characterized by low @xmath28 .",
    "these results further strengthen our conclusion stated above .",
    "it is also noted that use of the planar , els galactic potential to evaluate @xmath1 is not supported because the orbital motions in the @xmath29 direction are closely coupled with those in the plane .",
    "we obtain the fractional value of the thick disk s contribution @xmath30 in the range of @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath17 .",
    "figure  2(c ) indicates that in this metallicity range , the number of low-@xmath1 stars at @xmath31 kpc is systematically large compared to that in the range of [ fe / h]@xmath2 .",
    "the evaluation of this excess at @xmath31 kpc over the @xmath1 distribution in the halo - metallicity range of [ fe / h]@xmath2 allows us to obtain @xmath32 for @xmath8[fe / h]@xmath17 , and this value is increased to only @xmath33 even for @xmath34[fe / h]@xmath17 ( chiba & yoshii 1997 ) .",
    "thus , in contrast to earlier results suggesting a large @xmath30 ( e.g. @xmath35 by morrison , flynn & freeman 1990 ; @xmath36 by beers & sommer - larsen 1995 ) , the fraction of the metal - weak thick disk is found to be small .",
    "using the mostly unbiased sample of red giants and rr lyrae variables , we arrive at the conclusion that orbital eccentricities of metal - poor halo stars are no longer correlated with their metallicities .",
    "this result is virtually in contrast to the els result , but is in agreement with other studies using subdwarf stars ( carney et al .",
    "a detailed analysis of the eccentricity distribution of orbits , which is made possible for the first time by the accurate hipparcos proper motions ( esa 1997 ) and well - calibrated metal abundances of the almost complete halo sample ( att ; layden 1994 ; layden 1996 ) , allows us to conclude : ( 1 ) low-@xmath1 stars in the range of [ fe / h]@xmath2 belong to the halo , and ( 2 ) the metal - weak thick disk constitutes a small fraction down to its boundary at [ fe / h]@xmath18 .",
    "our sample stars are also less sensitive to the effects of secondary metal accretion onto the surface of stars ( yoshii 1981 ) , thereby the currently observed metallicities of these stars can be regarded to retain the fossil records for those when the stars were formed .",
    "the above conclusions set constraints on the scenarios for the contraction of the galaxy at high redshifts .",
    "the absence of a correlation between [ fe / h ] and @xmath1 suggests that the galaxy has not experienced a free - fall monolithic collapse ( els ) unless otherwise there remain no metal - poor , high angular momentum stars after collapse .",
    "alternatively , the galactic spheroid may have been assembled from merging or accretion of numerous fragments ( searle & zinn 1978 ) , such as dwarf - type galaxies , but whether or not the aftermath reproduces the observed kinematical distribution of stars is yet to be explored ( e.g. steinmetz & mller 1995 ) .",
    "the early evolution of the galaxy also involves the stage of the thick - disk formation .",
    "it is also yet unsettled whether or not a leading merger scenario for forming thick disk ( e.g. quinn et al . 1993 ) reproduces our finding of only few stars with disk - like kinematics in the range of [ fe / h]@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the comprehensive understanding of the observed chemo - kinematical properties of metal - poor stars demands to take more advanced approaches to study the galaxy formation , perhaps guided by both extensive numerical simulations of a collapsing galaxy and kinematical data of more stars in the whole region of the galactic space provided by next - generation astrometric telescopes .",
