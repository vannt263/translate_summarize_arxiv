    "the clustering phenomena is one of the fundamental problems in nuclear physics . despite of its long history since",
    "the discovery of the @xmath4-cluster , the clustering structure in nuclei is still under active investigation @xcite . to describe the @xmath4-cluster condensation in self - conjugate nuclei @xmath5c and @xmath6o ,",
    "the tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ( thsr ) wave function was proposed and provided a successful treatment of the famous hoyle ( @xmath7 ) state in @xmath5c @xcite .",
    "the thsr wave function has been applied to different aggregates of @xmath4-clusters including @xmath8be , @xmath5c and @xmath6o @xcite .",
    "it is also extended to study systems composed of general clusters such as @xmath9ne treated as a combination of an @xmath4-cluster and @xmath6o @xcite . in the study of inversion - doublet - band states of @xmath9ne , the thsr wave function , which was originally introduced to describe gas - like states ,",
    "was shown to be also very suitable for the study of non gas - like cluster type of states .",
    "the importance of the thsr wave function lies in the fact that the rgm / gcm ( resonating group method / generator coordinate method ) wave functions of both gas - like and non - gaslike states are almost 100% equivalent to single thsr wave functions .",
    "therefore the single thsr wave function grasps the physical properties of the state .",
    "the most important property is the nonlocalized character of clustering @xcite . on the other hand , superposing many brink wave functions in the gcm approach describes non - localized clustering because the brink - gcm wave function is almost 100% equivalent to a single thsr wave function .    following the success in describing self - conjugate nuclei",
    ", a natural question is whether we can apply the thsr wave function to general nuclei which consist not only of @xmath4-clusters but have also extra nucleons , such as @xmath10c studied with the interaction of @xmath4-condensation and an extra neutron @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be promising to extend the thsr wave function to @xmath11 nuclei .",
    "the nucleus @xmath1be is a typical @xmath11 nucleus with both @xmath12 cluster structure and also nuclear molecular orbits , which is most suitable for the extension of the thsr wave function .",
    "this study also belongs to our project which tries to understand any clustering phenomena from our new point of view .",
    "the nucleus @xmath1be has been studied with the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics free from cluster assumptions @xcite .",
    "it is also investigated with the nuclear molecular orbit ( mo ) model in which the extra neutron occupies nuclear molecular orbits @xcite . in the nuclear molecular orbit model",
    ", the wave function of the extra neutron is assumed to be a linear combination of cluster orbitals and provides a successful description of @xmath1be .",
    "however , the dynamics of the clusters is not explicitly given in these calculations . to have a clear view of the nonlocalized clustering dynamics in the @xmath1be nucleus ,",
    "we need a new wave function in which this characteristic is intrinsically included .",
    "in the present work , @xmath1be is investigated with a new picture in which two @xmath4-clusters and an extra nucleon are performing nonlocalized motion . a modified version of the thsr wave function is proposed for the description of this structure .",

    "the subsystem of two @xmath4-clusters is supposed to have rotational symmetry around the @xmath27-axis , so the same size parameters @xmath25 are used in @xmath28 and @xmath29 direction . for the extra neutron ,",

    "( [ eq : singlefunctionf ] ) we can also see that the @xmath27 component of orbital angular momentum @xmath73 is a good quantum number for the extra neutron .",

    "( [ eq : lz ] ) , we can write the @xmath27-component of total angular momentum as @xmath108 for the parallel and anti - parallel coupling of spin and the orbital angular momentum . as we will show later , because of the existence of spin - orbital interaction , the intrinsic wave function with @xmath109 has a much lower energy than @xmath110 . in the following calculations",
    ", @xmath109 is taken in the angular momentum projection operators .",
    "it should be noted here that @xmath71 and @xmath111 are parameters related to the intrinsic wave function only , while parameters @xmath85 and @xmath112 describe the state after angular momentum projection . the parameter @xmath112 can be chosen freely .",
    "the binding energy of @xmath1be can be obtained by a variational calculation with respect to parameters @xmath113 and @xmath37 as , @xmath114 the monte carlo method is used for the numerical integration of euler angle @xmath115 in the angular momentum projection and coordinates @xmath116 in creation operators .    in our calculations , we treat @xmath24 as a variational parameter and get as the optimum value @xmath117 fm , which is the same as that obtained for @xmath8be @xcite .",
    "this shows that the size of each @xmath4 clusters in @xmath1be is similar to the ones in @xmath8be .",
    "this also shows a relatively weak influence of the extra neutron on the @xmath4-clusters .",
    "the remaining optimum parameters in the thsr wave function are @xmath118 fm , @xmath119 fm , @xmath120 fm , and @xmath121 fm .    for the ground state of @xmath55be , we get an energy of -55.4 mev with the spin - orbit term of -2.2 mev with the thsr wave function .",
    "this negative value shows that , with @xmath109 , the system energy is lowered by the spin - orbit interaction . as a comparison , with the same parameters and @xmath110 , we get a much higher energy of -50.3 mev and a positive spin - orbit term of 2.2 mev .",

    "we use 72 brink wave functions of @xmath55be with 6 different @xmath4-@xmath4 distances and 12 different positions of the extra neutron as the bases in the brink+gcm calculation .",

    "the excitation energies calculated with both thsr and brink+gcm method are consistent with the experimental values .",
    "the differences between theoretical results and experimental results in binding energy is due to the choice of interactions .",
    "we also show the squared overlap between the thsr wave function and the brink+gcm wave function .",
    "the calculated squared overlap for the ground state state is about 96% and the results for the excited states are similar . as the brink+gcm wave function",
    "is generally considered as the exact wave function of the system , these overlaps show that the single thsr wave function provides a good description for these states .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to compare the thsr wave function with the nuclear molecular orbit model , we use @xmath122 fm which is the same value as in ref .",
    "the calculated binding energy of the ground state @xmath2 with different models but same interaction and parameter @xmath24 are listed in table [ table : energy ] . with the thsr wave function",
    ", we get a value of -54.7 mev for the binding energy of the ground state , which is almost the same as the result of the molecular orbit ( mo ) model without gcm technique in ref .",

    "comparison with the result of mo+gcm method in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that our result is about 1.3 mev higher .",
    "this is acceptable because the results of mo+gcm method should be compared with results of thsr+gcm model rather than with those from a single thsr wave function .",
    "we consider that both @xmath123 ground state and other states such as @xmath124 state will be well described by single thsr wave functions .",
    "this paper has shown that really a single thsr wave function well describes the @xmath123 ground state . in our near - future paper",

    "the excitation energies of two excited states are also reasonable compared with the experimental results . the squared overlap between the thsr wave function and the brink+gcm wave function",
    "are found to be close to 96% .",
    "this means that the thsr wave function provides a good description of the @xmath2 rotational band head of @xmath1be . with the same parameter @xmath122 fm ,",
    "our result for the binding energy of the ground state is consistent with the molecular orbit ( mo ) model but higher than in the mo+gcm model .",
    "the calculated rms radius of the ground state also agrees well with the experimental value . by calculating density distributions of the ground state of @xmath1be , the @xmath3-orbit structure is naturally reproduced by the thsr wave function without ad hoc assumption .",
    "the calculation of @xmath1be provides support for the extension of the nonlocalized clustering concept to @xmath11 nuclei .",
    "it also shows to possess the flexibility to describe other structures such as nuclear molecular orbital structure with the thsr wave function .",
    "though with our technique we essentially have not found anything for the @xmath55be structure which was not known before , we think that it is interesting to see that the thsr wave function also works with adding valence neutrons to the @xmath4 particles .",
