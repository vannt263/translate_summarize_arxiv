    "moreover , no isochrone can be found which matches both components . in summary ,",
    "low metallicity does not explain the small primary radius , even though this is suggested by the mass - radius diagram .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the models of @xmath8=0.0125 might agree with the observations in the hr diagram when adopting a different value of the primary effective temperature which is an input parameter in the lc analysis .",
    "while there is no significant effect on the radius measurements , the luminosities derived vary substantially .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancies in the mass - radius diagram will persist .",
    "we present new optical and nir photometry of tycra taken in 2006 - 2011 .",
    "the @xmath16 photometry taken complements the strmgren photometry studied by @xcite . for the first time",
    ", we present nir light curves of the secondary minimum taken in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands .",
    "in contrast to the optical light curves the secondary minimum is much better revealed in the nir and is more than @xmath19mag deep    we compiled all minima times available to us so that the o - c diagram of tycra now spans over two decades .",
    "the light - time effect of the spectroscopic tertiary is too small to explain the changes in the o - c diagram .",
    "there are probably other effects complicating the analysis like shifts of the observed minima due to photometric out - of - eclipse variability .",
    "we find , that rv measurements are more suitable to solve the tertiary orbit .",
    "one requires high - resolution high s / n spectroscopy with an echelle spectrograph at a 2-m class telescope covering at least one orbital period of the unresolved triple system ( 270 days most probably ) .",
    "the fourier - domain technique ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then can be used to disentangle the component s spectra for further analysis ( @xmath11 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 [ m / x ] ) and to improve the spectroscopic orbits .",
    "the orientation of the components rotational axes could be found analyzing the mclaughlin rotational effect during eclipses of the inner pair .",
    "long - baseline interferometry would help to determine orbital parameters of the outer orbit of the triple and to determine the distance to the system ( comparing interferometric and spectroscopic semi - major axis of the inner triple system ) and the total mass of the triple .",
    "for the first time , we present a multi - band solution of the light curve of the inner eclipsing binary in both optical and near-@xmath22 bands .",
    "the near-@xmath22 data requires to account for a third light contribution and thus also allows us to constrain the colours of the third light .",
    "the third light is composed of at least three sources which are the reflection nebula , the spectroscopic tertiary , and the visual fourth component .    only the radius and the luminosity of the primary do not agree with the values published by @xcite .",
    "agreement is not improved by restricting the analysis to the optical data .",
    "while the primary luminosities could be reconciled by adjusting the effective temperature of the primary , the derived primary radius is very robust and would not change .",
    "indeed , the absolute parameters of tycra do not agree with expectations .",
    "the primary component seems undersized when compared to other stars of same mass and to recent pisa evolutionary tracks and isochrones .",
    "the hr diagram shows that low metallicity can not explain the small radius of the primary .",
    "as speculated by @xcite , the subsynchronous rotation of the primary and effects on its internal structure might play a role .",
    "a very interesting question is whether the fourth component is actually bound to the tycra system . in order to decide whether the fourth component is bound",
    ", there is need for single - epoch ao observation of the system to establish the physical bond of the fourth visual component 03 away in 2002 .",
    "if it was a background star , the proper motion of ty  cra ( see table  [ comparison_tab ] ) would make the visual companion unresolved around 2012 .",
    "because of the high total mass of the whole system the orbital period of the outermost visual orbit is probably rather short : assuming a distance of @xmath23 = 130 pc , the 0294 separation observed in 2002 as the semi - major axis and the total mass of the system as 7 @xmath24 , we get @xmath25 = 89.3 years .",
