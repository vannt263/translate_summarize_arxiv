    "the concepts of dark energy ( de ) and dark matter ( dm ) @xcite-@xcite considered as two manifestations of one unified dark fluid @xcite-@xcite are basic elements of modern cosmology and astrophysics . because the dark fluid is estimated to accumulate about @xmath0 of the universe s energy , the coupling of de with dm predestine the main features of the universe evolution . in the first part of the work @xcite we introduced the so - called archimedean - type force , which is linear in the four - gradient of the de pressure and acts on the dm particles .",
    "this force is a relativistic generalization of the classical archimedean force and belongs to the class of effective forces described in @xcite-@xcite . from mathematical point of view",
    "the presented model gives us a new self - consistent nonlinear scheme of interaction between two constituents of the cosmic medium . from physical point of view",
    "the archimedean - type force is an effective redistributor of the total energy of the universe between the de and dm constituents .",
    "the archimedean - type model can be also considered in terms of two - fluid representation of the cosmic medium @xcite-@xcite , in which the interaction terms @xmath1 appear in the right - hand sides of separate balance equations for the de and dm with opposite signs and which disappear in a sum , when one deals with the total balance equation .",
    "we formulated in @xcite the theory of interaction between de and dm by using the relativistic hydrodynamics for dark energy and relativistic kinetics for dark matter .    in the first paper @xcite we focused on the submodels with some special values of guiding parameters , which admit exact analytical solutions of the total self - consistent system of master equations",
    "; in particular , we discussed the so - called anti - gaussian solution .",
    "now we consider the results of numerical and qualitative analysis for all admissible sets of guiding parameters and initial data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we recall briefly the key equations and basic formulas of the model with archimedean - type coupling between dark energy and dark matter . in sec.iii",
    "the numerical results are presented : in sec.iii a we explain the scheme of numerical analysis and details of results representation ; in sec.iii b we classify the models using the number of transition points and discuss details of seven submodels , the perpetually accelerated and periodic universes being among them . in sec.iv",
    "we analyze the model of archimedean - type coupling in terms of dynamic system associated with nonlinear key equation for the de pressure ; in sec.iv a we study the toy model , which relates to the autonomous dynamic system , find critical points and discuss two basic phase portraits of this system ; in sec.iv b we analyze instantaneous phase portraits of a general nonautonomous dynamic system in the context of numerical results presented in sec.iii ; in sec.iv c we consider asymptotical behavior of the models .",
    "sec.v contains discussions : in sec.v a we attract an attention to the inflationary behavior of the model in the early universe ; in sec.v b we show that all the models under discussion manifest the late - time accelerated expansion ; in sec.v.c we touch on the coincidence problem .",

    "nevertheless , in order to illustrate the main details of the universe expansion on the plots we considered only one ( leading ) component of the dm .",

    "we omit the discussion of submodels for which the dm energy density and dm pressure grow infinitely at @xmath67 or tend to finite ( nonvanishing ) asymptotic values .",
    "in other words , we restrict ourselves by the submodels , for which the de component dominates over dm starting from definite time moment ; this motive explains why we consider the parameters @xmath68 to be unchanged in the presented plots .",
    "there exist a lot of sets of the guiding parameters for which the solutions for the de energy and de pressure are asymptotically unstable ; we do not focus on them here .",
    "we discuss only the solutions for which the total energy @xmath69 is non - negative for arbitrary @xmath70 , thus guaranteeing that @xmath71 is a real function [ see ( [ einredu12 ] ) ] .    \\6 . in order to describe the archimedean - type model",
    "completely we have to indicate the domain in the multidimensional space of parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath53 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath45 and @xmath65 in which the solutions are nonsingular and asymptotically stable ; we hope to solve this problem in a special paper and do not discuss them here .",
    "figures 1 - 7 present the results of numerical calculations and are organized as follows . in the first panels labeled ( a ) [ @xmath72 the plot of the de energy @xmath73",

    "the analysis of the pictures presented in figs.1(f),2(f),3(f),4(f),5(f),6(f ) , and 7(f ) shows explicitly that for a wide choice of sets of the parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath53 , @xmath28 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath45 and @xmath65 the function @xmath78 is not monotonic and can change the sign .",
    "we indicate the points , in which the function @xmath78 changes the sign , as _ transition _ points , which divide the history of the universe into deceleration / acceleration _ epochs _ ; we denote these points as @xmath83 .",
    "the epochs with accelerated expansion can give way to the epochs with deceleration , the number of changes being finite or infinite .",
    "when the ( continuous ) curve @xmath78 has _ extrema _ , it is natural to divide the corresponding epochs into _ eras _ , the number of eras relates to the number of maximums and minimums .",
    "thus , depending on the number of transition points ( related to the number of ( simple ) roots of the equation @xmath84 ) , we divide below all the models into three classes and into a number of sub - classes .",
    "the first class of models relates to the case when the function @xmath78 is non - negative for @xmath85 . in @xcite",
    "we discussed the so - called anti - gaussian model : exact solutions in this model were presented in terms of elementary functions at @xmath86 . in particular , the acceleration parameter obtained there , @xmath87 , is a monotonic positively defined function exceeding the value @xmath88 , the acceleration parameter for the de sitter models . in other words , there are no transition points , there is no splitting of the history into epochs and eras , when we deal with an anti - gaussian universe .",
    "another example presented in @xcite describes superexponential expansion with the acceleration parameter given by @xmath89}}{\\cosh^2{\\left[\\sqrt{12\\pi g \\rho_0 } ( t{-}t_0 ) \\right]}}$ ] .",
    "the plot of this function starts with @xmath90 , reaches the maximum @xmath91 at @xmath92 , and tends asymptotically to @xmath93 . in the context of our terminology",
    ", we also deal with perpetually accelerated universe , but its history is now divided into two eras . here",
    "we discuss an alternative example of a perpetually accelerated universe with @xmath94 , studied numerically .",
    "typical pictures illustrating this class of models are given in fig.1 .",
    "is non - negative for arbitrary @xmath95 .",
    "since there are no transition points , in which @xmath96 changes the sign , the history of this universe includes only one epoch ; since at least five extrema can be recognized in fig.1(f ) , the history consists of six or more eras . here",
    "the dark solid line relates to the following set of the parameters : @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ( i.e. , the dm is initially medium - relativistic ) , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . ]    the solid curve in fig.1(f ) touches the line @xmath105 in one point , other curves lie above @xmath105 , thus there are no transition points . in this class of models",
    "the acceleration parameter @xmath19 as a function of time is non - negative for arbitrary @xmath95 : this means that the accelerated expansion of the universe is perpetual . for the model under discussion the de energy density @xmath15 is ( perpetually ) non - negative [ see fig.1(a ) ] , the de pressure @xmath16 is nonpositive .",
    "the acceleration parameter , the de energy density and pressure , and the hubble function change nonmonotonically with time , thus , the statefinder parameter @xmath106 , introduced in @xcite , is necessary to describe the details of the universe s evolution .",
    "we do not focus now on these fine details of the model and their physical interpretation , nevertheless , we have to stress , that extrema of the function @xmath78 divide naturally the history of the universe into the corresponding eras , thus describing the multistage character of its evolution .",
    "the history of a perpetually accelerated universe includes only one epoch , but consists at least of six eras .",
    "indeed , one can clearly identify at least three maximums and two minimums of the curve @xmath78 which divide the acceleration epoch into six eras . the first era ( @xmath107 )",
    "can be indicated as the era of a first superacceleration . during this era",
    "the de energy - density , @xmath73 , grows monotonically [ see fig.1(a ) ] , the dm energy density , @xmath74 , decreases [ see fig.1(b ) ] , but at the beginning of the era dm dominates over the de from the point of view of energy contribution .",
    "the second era finishes with slumps of the de energy density , of the hubble function and of the acceleration parameter .",
    "the de pressure , which reached its global maximum at this moment , becomes , clearly , a locomotive power of further universe evolution .",
    "the third era can also be indicated as the era of super - acceleration , which is characterized by the growth of de energy density and the hubble parameter .",
    "fourth , fifth , etc .",
    "eras can be considered in terms of relaxation to the state with asymptotically constant positive values @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and negative @xmath111 .",
    "the behavior of the dm state functions @xmath74 and @xmath76 during the second , third , etc .",
    "eras can not be recognized in the plots in fig.1(b ) and fig.1(d ) , that is why we visualize their behavior specially in the discussion below using more appropriate scale ( see fig.11 and fig.12 ) .",
    "we indicate the model by the term periodic when the equation @xmath84 has an infinite number of roots and the history of the universe splits into infinite number of identical epochs with accelerated and decelerated expansion . clearly , it is the case opposite to the first one ( perpetually accelerated universe ) .",
    "figure 2 illustrates this terminology : the de energy density and de pressure , as well as the hubble function and acceleration parameter oscillate with fixed frequency and amplitude ( we should keep in mind that the time scale in fig.2 ( a)-(f ) is logarithmic , so that the frequency seems to be visually increasing ) . in the model presented in fig.2",
    "the de energy density @xmath15 is non - negative , the averaged over time ( mean ) value of the de pressure @xmath112 is negative , and the sum @xmath113 is positive . the plots in the fig.2(e ) and fig.(2)(f ) demonstrate that the stable oscillatory regime starts in the universe after the second transition point .",
    "the first epoch is characterized by the decelerated expansion and consists of three eras ; at the end of the first era ( @xmath114 ) the dm contribution into the total energy density becomes negligible in comparison with the de contribution .",
    "the second epoch relates to the accelerated expansion and can be split into two eras , the maximal value of the acceleration parameter being about 3 times smaller than for the subsequent epochs .",
    "the scale factor @xmath2 oscillates near the de sitter curves [ see fig.2(g ) ] . the periodic model can be obtained as a limiting case , when the parameter @xmath115 tends to its critical value @xmath116",

    "not only the sum @xmath69 , but the de energy density @xmath15 itself remain non - negative .",
    "oscillations in the plots of the hubble function @xmath77 and of the scale factor @xmath2 are the most explicit ( see dark solid line ) , when the parameters of the model are the following : @xmath118 , @xmath119 ( i.e. , @xmath120 ) , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath121 . ]",
    "let us focus on the models for which the equation @xmath84 has a finite number of simple roots , @xmath122 .",
    "this means that during the universe evolution the epochs with accelerated expansion are changed @xmath123 times by the deceleration epochs , and vice versa .",
    "when the roots are not simple , special attention to such models is necessary , since the existence of the root does not guarantee the change of the sign of the function @xmath96 ( e.g. , when the root is double , the curve @xmath96 touches the line @xmath105 , and this root does not give a transition point ) .",
    "the class of models with @xmath123 transition points can be naturally divided into subclasses with @xmath124 , @xmath125 , etc . ; every subclass can be divided into sub - subclasses according to physical and geometrical motivation .",
