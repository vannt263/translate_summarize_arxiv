    "the networks that underlie real social interactions , whose nodes represent single individuals and whose links connect individuals that are expected to interact , vary with time and strongly depend on the kind of interactions involved . generally , however , social networks exhibit two specific topological properties that are closely related to the nature of social interactions .",
    "first , they are highly clustered , which means that two randomly chosen neighbors of a given individual have a relatively large probability of being in turn mutual neighbors .",
    "second , the distance between any two nodes in the network , measured as the number of links of the minimal path connecting the two nodes , is on the average very small as compared with the total number of nodes or links .",
    "this is the so - called small - world effect .",
    "small - world networks ( swns ) constitute a mathematical model for social networks that captures these two properties @xcite .",
    "they are partially disordered networks , interpolating between regular lattices and fully random graphs .",
    "in fact , @xmath0-node regular lattices with connections beyond nearest neighbors have high clustering , but the average distance between nodes is of order @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the average distance in random networks is of order @xmath1 , but the probability that two neighbors of a given node are mutual neighbors is of order @xmath2 . for moderate disorder , swns preserve the two desirable properties of ordered and random networks @xcite , and are therefore a convenient tool for the mathematical study of social processes @xcite .    small - world networks are built starting from an ordered lattice with moderately high connectivity , which insures high clustering .",
    "then , each link is removed with probability @xmath3 and reconnected between two randomly selected nodes .",
    "this process creates a shortcut between two otherwise distant regions of the network . the probability @xmath3 measures the degree of disorder or _ randomness _ of the resulting graph . for @xmath4 order is fully preserved , while for @xmath5 a random graph is obtained .",
    "note however that the average connectivity is constant .",
    "topological properties of swns , such as the average distance between nodes , display a crossover from the behavior observed in regular lattices to that of random graphs at a randomness @xmath6 . in the limit of an infinitely large network , a critical transition between both regimes occurs at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "similar transitions at the same critical point are found for some simple dynamical processes on swns , such as for ising - like spin systems @xcite and ensembles of coupled oscillators .",
    "in contrast , it has been recently shown that other kinds of processes display a transition between qualitatively different dynamical regimes at finite values of the randomness .",
    "specifically , in an epidemiological model where an initially susceptible individual infected by contagion undergoes a disease cycle that returns to the susceptible state , a transition at finite @xmath3 occurs between a regime where the disease cycles of different individuals are temporally uncorrected ( low @xmath3 ) to a regime where the cycles synchronize ( high @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , in an epidemic - like model for rumor propagation a quantitatively similar transition has been found between a regime where the rumor remains localized ( low @xmath3 ) to a regime where it spreads over a finite fraction of the network ( high @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the critical - phenomenon nature of the transition found in the model of rumor propagation has been convincingly proven by means of finite - size scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "this paper , on the other hand , focuses on a detailed characterization of the dynamical properties of the same model , with emphasis on the effects introduced by the small - world topology . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and summarize the main results on the critical transition between the regimes of localization and propagation .",
    "the core of the paper , sects .",
    "[ infected ] and [ dsw ] , is devoted to establish the connection between the several parameters of our model and suitable quantities that characterize its evolution .",
    "this is done both in quenched small - world networks and in the so - called dynamic small worlds , where quenched disorder in the interaction links is replaced by stochastic choice of the interaction partners .",
    "we emphasize similarities and differences between both cases .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss the main results .",
    "consider a population formed by @xmath0 individuals where , at each time step , each individual adopts one of three possible states . in the first state ,",
    "the individual has not heard the rumor yet . in the second state ,",
    "the individual is aware of the rumor and is willing to transmit it . finally , in the third state",
    ", the individual has heard the rumor but has lost the interest in it , and does not transmit it . by analogy with sir epidemiological models",
    "@xcite , these three states are respectively called susceptible , infected , and refractory . at the beginning , only one individual is infected and all the remnant population is susceptible .",
    "the dynamical rules act as follows @xcite . at each time step ,",
    "an individual @xmath8 is chosen at random from the infected population .",
    "this individual contacts one of her neighbors , say @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 is in the susceptible state , @xmath8 transmits the rumor and @xmath9 becomes infected . if , on the other hand , @xmath9 is already infected or refractory , then @xmath8 loses her interest in the rumor and becomes refractory .    in qualitative terms , the dynamics can be summarized as follows . in the first stage of the evolution",
    ", the number of infected individuals increases and , at a lower rate , the refractory population grows as well . as a consequence ,",
    "the contacts of infected individuals between themselves and with refractory individuals become more frequent .",
    "eventually , the infected population begins to decline and vanishes , and the evolution stops . at the end",
    ", the population is divided into a group of @xmath10 refractory individuals , who have been infected at some stage during the evolution , and a group of susceptible individuals who have never heard the rumor .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , in the case where contacts can be established between any two individuals in the population , the fraction @xmath11 of refractory individuals at the end of the evolution approaches a well - defined limit @xmath12 for asymptotically large systems , @xmath13 .",
    "this fraction is given by the nontrivial solution to the transcendental equation @xmath14 i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , some @xmath16 of the population never becomes aware of the rumor .",
    "we are here interested in the case where contacts between individuals are established along the links imposed by a socially plausible structure , namely a small - world network . as advanced in the introduction",
    ", swns are built starting from an ordered lattice , with one individual at each node .",
    "we choose a one - dimensional array with periodic boundary conditions , where each node is connected to its @xmath17 nearest neighbors , i. e. to the @xmath18 nearest neighbors clockwise and counterclockwise .",
    "then each of the @xmath18 clockwise connections of each node @xmath8 is rewired with probability @xmath3 to a randomly chosen node @xmath9 , not belonging to the neighborhood of @xmath8",
    ". a shortcut is thus created .",
    "we avoid double and multiple links between node , and discard realizations where the swn becomes disconnected .",
    "previous analysis of this system , focused on the characterization of its final state , has revealed that a critical transition between two well - differentiated regimes occurs at a finite value @xmath19 of the randomness @xcite . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the final number @xmath10 of refractory individuals , averaged over many realizations of the system , is independent of the population size .",
    "therefore , as @xmath21 , the ratio @xmath11 tends to vanish . in such limit ,",
    "only an infinitesimal fraction of the population becomes aware of the rumor , which remains localized in a small neighborhood of its origin . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath22 the average value of @xmath23 approaches a constant as @xmath0 grows .",
    "finite - size scaling analysis in the specific case of @xmath24 shows that , for asymptotically large systems , @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for larger values of @xmath18 , the critical randomness @xmath19 decreases .",
    "the exponent @xmath28 , in contrast , seems to be universal .",
    "a clue to the origin of the localization - propagation transition is provided by the distribution @xmath29 of values of @xmath10 over large series of realizations of our system for fixed @xmath18 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 . figure [ f1 ] shows those distributions for @xmath24 , two values of @xmath3below and above the transition  and three values of @xmath0 . at each realization",
    ", the swn is constructed anew .",
    "for @xmath20 the distribution is approximately exponential , and does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , the average value of @xmath10 is also independent of the system size and , as advanced above , the ratio @xmath11 decreases as @xmath0 grows .",
    "more specifically , @xmath30 for large @xmath0 . in a typical realization for @xmath20 the rumor remains localized due to the high interconnectivity of the network at the local level and the scarce density of shortcuts .",
    "transmission occurs between a small group of individuals which rapidly loose their interest in the rumor , and propagation to distant regions is highly improbable .",
    "in contrast , the distribution for @xmath22 is bimodal , with two maxima separated by a local minimum .",
    "the small-@xmath10 regime is still independent of @xmath0 and attains a maximum near @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "for large values of @xmath10 , we find an additional bump - like structure , which changes with the system size .",
    "specifically , the position of its maximum @xmath32 shifts rightward as @xmath0 grows , as @xmath33 .",
    "since , meanwhile , the area under the bump remains almost constant , this additional structure produces a contribution of order @xmath0 to the average value of @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , @xmath23 is finite above the transition .",
    "while in a realization belonging to the small-@xmath10 regime the rumor remains localized as in the case of @xmath20 , a typical realization contributing to the bump includes propagation through several shortcuts , thus attaining distant regions in the system .    for @xmath34 , the distribution ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) exhibits power - law dependence for moderate values of @xmath10 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the power - law regime terminates at a smooth cut - off , whose position shifts to the right as the system size increases , approximately as @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the localization - propagation transition of our model has been described in terms of static features , namely the final refractory population @xmath10 , measured when all the interaction events have ceased . in the next section ,",
    "we focus on our central interest here and study the dynamics of the propagation process .",
    "a complete characterization of the propagation process in our model is given by the evolution of the infected population . initially , all the population is susceptible , except for an infected individual .",
    "then , at each evolution step , either the number of infected individuals @xmath38 increases to @xmath39 at the expense of the susceptible population , or @xmath38 decreases to @xmath40 and the refractory population grows accordingly .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the number of both susceptible and refractory individuals is implicit in the evolution of @xmath38 . in order to give @xmath38 as a function of time",
    ", it must be taken into account that the number of infected individuals varies and , consequently , the real - time duration of an evolution step changes . at each evolution step , in fact , time is to be updated according to @xmath41 where the constant @xmath42 fixes time units .",
    "we choose @xmath43 , so that the unit of time can be associated with the typical time needed by a single infected individual to establish a contact with one of her neighbors .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the evolution of the number of infected individuals as a function of time for two single realizations with @xmath44 and @xmath24 , for two values of the network randomness , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for @xmath45",
    "the final number of refractory individuals is @xmath47 , while for @xmath48 we have @xmath49 .",
    "this latter realization belongs to the large-@xmath10 bump structure in @xmath29 for the corresponding value of @xmath3 .",
    "realizations for the same randomness but in the small-@xmath10 region are qualitatively similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ f2]a .    the graph of @xmath38 as a function of time for small @xmath3or , for @xmath22 , in the region of small @xmath10is reminiscent of a random walk . as a matter of fact",
    ", the evolution of the number of infected individuals can be thought of as a one - dimensional random walk in the @xmath38-space , starting at @xmath50 and with an absorbing boundary condition at the origin , @xmath51 , where the evolution terminates .",
    "equivalently , we may think of a first - passage - time problem , with respect to the origin , for a random walker starting at @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this analogy , however , is difficult to exploit , since in our case the random walk would be biased by a complex time - dependent asymmetry .",
    "in fact , the probability for @xmath38 to grow or decrease depends not only on @xmath38 itself , but also on the number of both susceptible and refractory individuals .",
    "the effect of this bias would be particularly strong for the large-@xmath10 realizations with @xmath22 . in this case , indeed , the evolution of @xmath52 does not resemble a random trajectory but mimics deterministic dynamics affected by a moderate level of noise ( see fig .",
    "[ f2]b ) .",
    "the first - passage - time analogy suggests anyway that a compact quantitative characterization of the propagation process is given by the total time @xmath53 elapsed up to the extinction of the infected population , and the maximum number of infected individuals during the evolution , @xmath54 . in the associated random walk ,",
    "these two quantities correspond to the first - passage time and the maximum span from the origin , respectively . in order to compare with our previous results , we measure @xmath53 and @xmath54 as a function of the final refractory population @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath10 is directly related to the duration of the propagation process measured in evolution steps .",
    "in fact , since the final number of infected individuals is zero , each step where a susceptible individual becomes infected must be compensated by a step where an infected individual becomes refractory .",
    "since an extra step of this latter kind is needed for the first infected individual , the total number of steps necessary for the extinction of the infected population is exactly @xmath55 . on the other hand , due to the changing duration of steps in real time , eq .",
    "( [ time ] ) , the connection between @xmath53 and @xmath10 is more complex .    in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , we present measurements of the total time @xmath53 as a function of @xmath10 over series of @xmath56 realizations , for swns with @xmath24 and three different sizes , and for two values of the randomness @xmath3 . for small @xmath3",
    "there is a quite well defined power - law dependence , @xmath57 , spanning almost two orders of magnitude in @xmath10 .",
    "linear fitting of these data yields an exponent @xmath58 close to @xmath59 .",
    "this result differs from the value predicted by the random - walk analogy for an unbiased random walk in the @xmath38-space , which gives @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , it can satisfactorily reproduced by a random walk with constant bias , with probabilities @xmath61 of moving towards @xmath62 and @xmath63 of moving in the opposite direction .",
    "we recall , however , that the analogy would be strict for a time - dependent bias only . for @xmath22",
    "the above power - law dependence is still observed in the small-@xmath10 regime , but apparent deviations appears as @xmath10 grows . in particular , the detached `` cloud '' of dots observed for @xmath64 and @xmath65 at large values of @xmath10which",
    "correspond to realizations in the bump structure observed in @xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "[ f1])does not satisfy the power - law relation .",
    "the total evolution times associated with such realizations are considerably below those predicted by an extrapolation from the small-@xmath10 region , and the difference becomes larger as the size @xmath0 grows .",
    "note moreover , from the insert in fig .",
    "[ f3]b , that inside the `` cloud '' there is no obvious correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath10 , in contrast with the small-@xmath10 regime .",
    "these features make it evident that a qualitative change in the dynamical behavior occurs between the regimes of small and large @xmath10 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .",
    "essentially the same features are found for the dependence on @xmath10 of the maximum number of infected individuals during the whole evolution , @xmath54 , shown in fig .",
    "now , however , the exponent in the power - law relation @xmath66 , observed to hold in the small-@xmath10 regime , is close to @xmath67 , which does coincide with the result for an ordinary unbiased random walk . for large @xmath10 ,",
    "the `` clouds '' of dots quoted above deviate in this case to higher values of @xmath54 .",
    "a detail of the `` cloud '' for @xmath44 , shown in the insert of fig .",
    "[ f4]b , reveals a remnant correlation between @xmath54 and @xmath10 .",
    "note that the power - law dependence of @xmath53 and @xmath54 on @xmath10 , implies the relation @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "this relation is expected to hold for small randomness or , more generally , for small @xmath10 .    through the study of the evolution of the infected population",
    ", we have so far examined the dynamical properties of our model for just two values of the small - world randomness @xmath3 , below and above the localization - propagation transition at @xmath19 .",
    "it is now worthwhile to discuss how the results change as @xmath3 is varied . for @xmath70 , as a matter of fact , the power - law dependence of @xmath53 and @xmath54 on @xmath10 is not modified .",
    "the exponents @xmath58 and @xmath71 are the same within our numerical precision . on the contrary , above the transition , substantial changes affect the frequency distribution of the final refractory population @xmath10 and its relation to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in the first place ,",
    "the relative number of realizations in the small-@xmath10 regime and in the bump at large @xmath10 varies considerably with @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ f5 ] shows the fraction @xmath72 of realizations in the large-@xmath10 bump as a function of @xmath3 for three values of @xmath0 and @xmath24 .",
    "this fraction grows from @xmath73 for @xmath48 to @xmath74 for the maximum randomness @xmath5 .",
    "as expected , realizations where the rumor attains a significant fraction of the population become more frequent as the network randomness grows .",
    "note moreover that the dependence with the system size @xmath0 is quite weak , but there is no clear indication of saturation for large @xmath0 .    as for the dependence of the total evolution time @xmath53 and the maximum number of infected individuals @xmath54 on the final refractory population @xmath10 , the small-@xmath10 regime exhibits no significant modifications as @xmath3 changes .",
    "the power - law dependence with the same exponents is maintained , as expected from the fact that the realizations in this regime correspond to propagation of the rumor over a limited neighborhood of its origin .",
    "in contrast , the bump in @xmath29 varies in position and the corresponding values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 change . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , we show the average values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 as a function of the fraction @xmath11 corresponding to realizations in the bump for several values of @xmath3 . roughly speaking , each dot represents the centers of the `` clouds '' referred to in connection with figs .",
    "[ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , now for varying randomness . for fixed @xmath0 , the final refractory population @xmath10 grows with @xmath3 .",
    "for the largest systems , in fact , @xmath10 is practically doubled as @xmath3 varies from @xmath46 to @xmath75 .",
    "we thus verify again that propagation is more efficient for larger randomness .",
    "this effect is enhanced by the fact that , at the same time , the maximum infected population @xmath54 increases and the total time @xmath53 decreases . for large systems , @xmath53 is reduced by a factor of @xmath76 whereas @xmath54 grows by a factor of @xmath77 , approximately . in summary , the process becomes simultaneously more effective and more rapid .",
    "note , finally , the strong saturation in the values of @xmath23 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 as the randomness approaches its maximum @xmath5 .",
    "let us end this section by addressing the effects of changing the average number of neighbors per node , given by the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "as for the localization - propagation transition , a growth in the number of neighbors implies that the critical randomness @xmath19 decreases and that , for fixed @xmath3 , the final fraction of refractory individuals increases @xcite .",
    "these two results agree with the expected fact that propagation is more efficient for larger @xmath18 .",
    "the same trend is observed in the parameters that characterize the evolution of the infected population : while the total time @xmath53 decreases , the maximum number of infected individuals @xmath54 grows . our results for @xmath24 , in any case",
    ", are not qualitatively changed when other values of @xmath18 are considered .",
    "dynamic small worlds ( dsws ) have been introduced as a variant to swns in the frame of a model for activity propagation in a system of mobile automata @xcite . instead of considering a frozen disordered interaction network ,",
    "dsws admit interactions between any two individuals occupying the nodes of a regular lattice . in the case of a one - dimensional array with periodic boundary conditions , at each interaction event , the partner of an individual is chosen with probability @xmath78 among its @xmath17 nearest neighbors , @xmath18 clockwise and @xmath18 counterclockwise . with the complementary probability @xmath3 , the partner is chosen at random from the whole lattice . in this way ,",
    "all individuals have the chance to interact with arbitrarily distant partners , but the probability of distant interactions is controlled by the `` randomness '' @xmath3 .    the change from swns to dsws , which conveys the replacement of frozen disorder by a stochastic process ,",
    "is qualitatively similar to the introduction of the so - called annealed approximation in the study of disordered boolean ( kauffman ) networks @xcite .",
    "a considerable advantage of dsws over swns regards the numerical implementation , which does not require the generation of a new lattice at each realization  a highly time - consuming step in our specific system .",
    "however , the main virtue of dsws  shared with the annealed model for kauffman networks  is that , in principle , they admit a simpler analytical treatment .",
    "in particular , the limit @xmath5 should be exactly described , in asymptotically large systems , by a mean - field - like approach .",
    "we show in the following that the behavior of the rumor propagation model on a dsw bears remarkable similarity with the case of a swn , though some significant quantitative differences are detected .",
    "let us first of all point out that , as for the dependence of our model on the system size @xmath0 and on the average number of neighbors per individual , @xmath17 , the features described in the previous section for swns are qualitatively reproduced in dsws .",
    "consequently , we do not repeat the analysis for varying @xmath0 and @xmath18 , and focus here on the specific case @xmath64 , @xmath24 . the behavior for other values of @xmath0 and @xmath18",
    "can be inferred from this case and the results for swns .",
    "it has already been advanced @xcite that our model on a dsw undergoes the same kind of localization - propagation transition found on swns .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , where we show the final fraction of refractory individuals @xmath11 as a function of @xmath3 , for @xmath64 and @xmath24 .",
    "the critical point has considerably decreased , to @xmath79 .",
    "meanwhile , as expected , the fraction @xmath23 approaches the solution to eq .",
    "( [ r * ] ) , @xmath80 as @xmath81 .",
    "note in fact that the original version of the model , discussed in sect .",
    "[ model ] , is a kind of mean - field approximation of the small - world case , which becomes exact for @xmath5 .    as for swns , the nature of the localization - propagation transition in dsws is revealed by the frequency distribution of the final number of refractory individuals , @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ f8 ] shows this distribution for three values of @xmath3 . for @xmath82",
    "we find a rapidly decaying function which , as in the subcritical regime on swns , results to be roughly exponential . in this case , in fact , the contribution of distant interactions is negligible , so that no significant differences are to be expected between dsws and swns . for @xmath83 , which approximately corresponds to the critical point @xmath19 in dsws ,",
    "the distribution is a power law over a substantial interval , @xmath84 .",
    "remarkably , the exponent of this power law coincides  up to the numerical precision  with that obtained at the critical randomness in swns , @xmath85 ( cf .",
    "[ model ] ) . finally , above the critical point ( @xmath86 ) , we find that the by - now familiar bump structure at large @xmath10 has developed .",
    "the strong similarity with the scenario on swns convincingly suggests that the origin of the localization - propagation transition is the same for both systems .",
    "the insert of fig . [ f8 ] shows the fraction @xmath72 of realizations that contribute to the bump , as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "comparing with fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , which shows the same results for swns , we note that  apart from the obvious consequences of the shift of @xmath19 to the left ",
    "the fraction @xmath72 attains considerably larger values .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath87 for @xmath88 . for such values of @xmath3 , therefore , the rumor propagates to distant regions and attains a finite portion of the system in virtually _ all _ realizations .",
    "an important contribution to this difference with swns is given by the following fact . in our swns , links between individuals are bidirectional .",
    "this implies that if an infected individual @xmath8 transmits the rumor to a susceptible neighbor @xmath9 , there is a relatively high probability that , in the future , the now infected individual @xmath9 will ( unsuccessfully ) attempt to transmit the rumor to @xmath8 and will become refractory .",
    "these unsuccessful trials for backward propagation are by far more improbable in dsws , especially for large @xmath3 , and the rumor spreading is consequently enhanced .",
    "for @xmath20 the total evolution time @xmath53 and the maximum number of infected individuals @xmath54 satisfy the same power - law dependence of @xmath10 as in swns .",
    "in fact , as far as long - range interactions remain infrequent , the evolution on swns and dsws is essentially equivalent . the same argument",
    "can be extended for @xmath22 in small-@xmath10 realizations . in this case , however , the exponent @xmath58 in the relation @xmath57 results to be smaller than for swns ; now , we find @xmath89 .",
    "the moderate contribution of distant contacts is here enough to produce a considerable decrease of the total evolution time .",
    "since contacts between any two individuals are now possible , propagation on dsws is faster .",
    "the fact that propagation on dsws is faster and more effective than in swns becomes dramatically emphasized as soon as the large-@xmath10 regime is analyzed .",
    "figure [ f9 ] shows @xmath53 and @xmath54 as functions of @xmath10 for large `` randomness , '' ranging from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "these plots show the `` clouds '' corresponding to the large-@xmath10 bump structure , and are therefore analogous to the inserts of figs .",
    "[ f3]b and [ f4]b .",
    "the typical values of @xmath10 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 in these dsw realizations are to be compared with the corresponding values for swns , shown in fig .",
    "while , for @xmath64 , the fraction @xmath11 attains in swns a maximum average level of about @xmath92 for @xmath5 , in dsws @xmath23 reaches a typical value close to @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "the differences in @xmath53 and @xmath54 are even more drastic . in swns ,",
    "their extreme average values are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , whereas in dsws they change to @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "as the `` randomness '' of dsws approaches its maximum value @xmath5 , the system should be satisfactorily described by a mean - field approximation .",
    "the analytical treatment of our model within such approximation is developed in the appendix .",
    "there we show that , for a given size @xmath0 , it is possible to predict the values of @xmath54 , @xmath10 , and a lower bound for @xmath53 .",
    "these values are compared with numerical results in fig .",
    "the agreement with the average of numerical results is very good for the largest `` randomness , '' @xmath94 .",
    "these results , however , show considerable fluctuations with respect to the values predicted by the mean - field approximation .",
    "moreover , fluctuations in @xmath10 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are closely correlated .",
    "note that the same kind of correlations were suggested in swns by the results shown in the inserts of figs .",
    "[ f3]b and [ f4]b .",
    "since , as discussed above , dsws can be more efficiently implemented in numerical experiments , our results in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] correspond to a number of realizations considerably larger than for swns , and such correlations become apparent .",
    "it turns out that the correlations between the values of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath10 obtained in single realizations can be explained in terms of the mean - field approximation .",
    "in fact , calculating @xmath54 and @xmath10 , and the lower bound for @xmath53 from this approximation for _ different _ values of the system size @xmath0ranging from @xmath99 to @xmath100we obtain the values shown in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] as curves .",
    "these values successfully reproduce the correlation between the three quantities .",
    "specifically , as @xmath0 increases , @xmath53 decreases slowly and @xmath10 grows , while  as shown in the appendix@xmath54 and @xmath10 are linearly correlated . from a phenomenological viewpoint",
    ", these results can be interpreted as if in each individual realization the system appears to have an `` effective '' size  close to , but different from , its actual size  plausibly determined by variations in the effectiveness with which the rumor spreads over the population .",
    "we have here studied the evolution of an epidemic - like model evolving on small - world geometries .",
    "the dynamics , which can be interpreted as the spreading of a rumor , is known to exhibit a transition between regimes of localization and propagation at a finite randomness of the underlying disordered geometry @xcite .",
    "epidemiological models on geometries that plausibly represent social networks and information webs  such as small - world and scale - free networks @xcite  have recently attracted much attention , in view of their potential role in the description of actual risk situations associated with infectious diseases and computer viruses @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "the effectiveness of propagation is characterized by the total number @xmath10 of individuals that have been infected during the whole evolution .",
    "generally , in a single realization of the process on an asymptotically large system of size @xmath0 , propagation affects either a vanishingly small fraction of the population , @xmath101 , or a finite fraction @xmath23 . for a randomness @xmath3 below the critical point @xmath19 of the localization - propagation transition",
    ", only the small-@xmath10 regime is observed , and the rumor remains localized within a limited neighborhood of its origin . for @xmath22 , on the other hand , realizations in both regimes are observed .",
    "the fraction of realizations in the large-@xmath10 regime , in fact , grows as the randomness increases .",
    "the dynamics of our model is completely described by the evolution of the number @xmath38 of infected individuals . a compact characterization of this evolution is given by the total time @xmath53 elapsed up to the extinction of the infected population , the maximum number @xmath54 of infected individuals at a given time , and the total number @xmath10 of infected individuals during the whole evolution .",
    "the effectiveness of propagation increases when @xmath53 decreases , because spreading is faster , and when @xmath10 and @xmath54 grow , because the rumor reaches a larger population .",
    "our results for small - world networks can be summarized as follows . for any value of @xmath3",
    ", the small-@xmath10 regime is characterized by power - law correlations between @xmath53 , @xmath10 , and @xmath54 .",
    "it has been suggested that these correlation could be explained in terms of a random - walk picture of the propagation process in the @xmath38-space .",
    "a rigorous analogy , however , can only be achieved in terms of a biased random walk with a rather complicated time - dependent bias . in the large-@xmath10 regime ,",
    "the values of @xmath53 , @xmath10 , and @xmath54 obtained in single realizations are distributed around certain typical values , which vary as the network randomness @xmath3 changes .",
    "specifically , as @xmath3 grows , @xmath53 decreases and both @xmath10 and @xmath54 increase , indicating that the propagation process becomes increasingly effective .",
    "the three quantities show a quite marked saturation as the randomness approaches its limiting value @xmath5 .",
    "the effectiveness of propagation is also improved , as expected , when the average number of neighbors per individual grows .",
    "we have also studied these features in a so - called dynamic small world . instead of considering a frozen network of interaction links , dynamics small worlds admit that distant contacts can occur between any two individuals , chosen at random at each evolution step .",
    "we have here shown that , as far as our model is concerned , propagation in a dynamic small world is qualitatively the same as on a small - world network .",
    "namely , the same kind of correlations between @xmath53 , @xmath10 , and @xmath54 and the same dependence with @xmath3 observed on small - world networks are reproduced in dynamic small worlds .",
    "the main quantitative difference between both cases is that in dynamics small worlds the effectiveness of propagation is considerably higher .",
    "evolution times are overall shorter and infected populations larger than on small - world networks . in qualitative terms , this is plausibly due to the fact that , in dynamics small worlds , the average number of interaction partners per individual is very large and the effect of backpropagation is comparatively negligible , especially , in large populations .    to our knowledge , this is the first time that the evolution of a dynamical process is compared in detail on small - world networks and in dynamic small worlds .",
    "it may be conjectured that our main conclusions regarding this comparison will hold for a large class of processes .",
    "a systematic comparison would in fact be desirable since , though small - world networks have attracted considerably more attention than dynamic small worlds , the latter have the advantage of easier analytical and numerical treatment and , moreover , provide a more realistic model of social systems with mobile individuals .",
