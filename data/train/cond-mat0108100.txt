    "chirality in liquid crystals produces a fascinating variety of phases , such as the blue phases .",
    "three blue phases ( bps ) designated bp i , bp ii , and bp iii have been identified , and their structures are now well understood .",
    "bp i and bp ii exhibit long - range periodic order at the half micron scale and bragg scatter visible light . for these reasons ,",
    "the optical study of blue phases is an active field of research , with a particular emphasis on spatial dispersion effects such as the optical activity .    the first experiments on the optical activity in the pretransitional region of the isotropic phase above the isotropic - cholesteric transition were carried out by cheng and meyer @xcite .",
    "using a general formulation due to de gennes , they calculated and confirmed experimentally that the pretransitional optical activity depends on the temperature as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the metastability temperature of the isotropic phase .",
    "two years later , brazovskii and dmitriev developed the first complete theory of phase transitions in cholesteric liquid crystals , and they predicted the existence of the blue phases @xcite .",
    "the optical activity in the pretransitional region was derived using this approach by dolganov et al .",
    "@xcite . at this time , a detailed landau theory of the cholesteric blue phases was obtained by hornreich and shtrikman , who also provided an outstanding study of the light scattering in the blue phases including a treatment of the polarization of the light , based on the formalism of the mller matrices @xcite .",
    "bensimon , domany , and shtrikman studied the optical activity in the pretransitional regime and in the blue phases @xcite , confirming and extending the work of dolganov . in their paper , the blue phase bp iii was considered as an amorphous polycrystalline structure distinct from the isotropic phase , and their treatment of the optical activity relied on the long wavelength approximation . on the experimental side ,",
    "the wavelength dependence of the optical activity in the blue phases was measured by collings @xcite .",
    "the structure of bp iii still remained mysterious until experiments clearly showed a continuous transition between bp iii and the isotropic phase @xcite and the existence of a critical point terminating a line of coexistence of the two phases @xcite .",
    "the same year , lubensky and stark developed a theory for the isotropic to bp iii transition with a chiral liquid - gas like critical point @xcite , which was extended to include scaling theory in ref .",
    "very recently , there has been a renewal of interest in the study of the blue phases with the discovery of the smectic blue phases @xcite , exhibiting isotropic - bp iii coexistence terminating at a critical point @xcite .    in section [ sec : theory ] of this paper , we introduce an effective index for the propagation of light in the isotropic phase and in bp iii , which contains pretransitional effects such as the optical activity and the circular dichroism . in section [ sec : long_wavelength ] , we present a standard derivation which is based on the long wavelength approximation @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : de vries ] , we make a digression on the optical properties of periodic chiral media for comparison with the case of non - periodic chiral media . by evaluating our weak - scattering expression for the optical dielectric constant tensor in a cholesteric phase , we find the well - known de vries formula , which describes the optical activity of light propagating in this medium along the pitch axis . in section [ sec : exact_wavel ] we come back to isotropic chiral media and obtain the optical activity for arbitrary wavelength and chirality .",
    "this approach is new in that it is general , not limited to the long wavelength approximation , and applicable in particular to the resonant region where the wavelength of the light is of the order of the pitch of the cholesteric , a regime which has not been considered in detail in previous studies . in the long wavelength approximation",
    ", we collect contributions to the optical activity up to order @xmath4 .",
    "though various contributions up to this order have appeared separately in the literature @xcite and very recently in @xcite , these references are not fully consistent with each other . we therefore think that it is important to collect and discuss all these contributions in one place .",
    "we then generalize our method and obtain the wavelength dependance of the circular dichroism and of the symmetric part of the index , which to our knowledge have not appeared in the literature and have never been measured .",
    "finally in section [ sec : theory&exp ] , our theoretical predictions are supported by experimental spectra of the optical activity for different values of the chirality in the bp iii phase @xcite .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiments is very good .",
    "experiments confirm the presence of a broad maximum in the magnitude of the optical activity when the wavelength is of the order of the pitch and for positive ( respectively negative ) pitch .",
    "this feature is the pretransitional signature in isotropic chiral media of the divergence arising from the long - range periodicity of the cholesteric phase , bp i and bp ii .",
