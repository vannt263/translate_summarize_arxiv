    "recently , investigation of the role of scalar dissipation and dissipation sheets has become an extremely active field ( see , for example , excellent reviews by bilger ( 2004 ) , sreenivasan ( 2004 ) , peters ( 2000 ) , dimotakis ( 2005 ) and recent papers by celani et al ( 2005 ) , villermaux et al ( 2003 ) and bush et al ( 1998 ) . )      based on a classic kolomogorov s cascade concept , we illustrate the main qualitative features of the mixing of two liquids ( chemical components ) @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",

    "we assume the linear dimension of a blob @xmath16 . at this point ,",
    "the area of the interface , separating @xmath11 and @xmath10 substances , is @xmath17 .",
    "the life- ( turn - over ) time of this eddy is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the rms value of turbulent velocity .",
    "the magnitude of the energy flux across scales is @xmath20 with @xmath21 . in accord with kolmogorov s phenomenology , after @xmath22 seconds , by nonlinear interactions , this eddy is transformed into another one of the linear dimensions @xmath23 and @xmath24 . since the gradient in the @xmath25-direction is largest , the characteristic time - scale of this , `` daughter '' structure is : @xmath26 .",
    "then , after @xmath27 steps    @xmath28    where the viscous time is denoted as @xmath29 .",
    "we see that the viscous time of a structure strongly decreases with the number of ` cascade steps ' .",
    "the time needed to form the smallest kolmogorov eddies on the scale @xmath30 is thus :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 .",
    "it is important that the reynolds number @xmath14 used in the above relations is to be distinguished from @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mean velocity in the flow . typically , numerically , @xmath35 .",
    "the fact that kolmogorov s scale @xmath36 and dissipation rate @xmath37 are formed on the time - scale of a single large - scale turn - over time ( @xmath38 ) has been tested in various numerical experiments .    if the schmidt number @xmath39 , in accord with the cascade picture , the kolmogorov scale is the smallest legth - scale created by turbulence and at times @xmath40 , the mixing proceeds by molecular diffusion .    if however , @xmath41 and the scalar diffusion is extremely inefficient , then , after formation of the kolmogorov scale @xmath36 , the stretching process by the large - scale ( @xmath42 ) velocity field leads to generation of the ever thinner scalar - enriched sheets until @xmath43 .",
    "it is only after that , the scalar diffusion takes over the mixing process .",
    "the mean width of these sheets is : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is called the batchelor ( 1959 ) scale . at this stage , the substances @xmath11 and @xmath10 , separated by the distance @xmath45 , can mix only by molecular diffusion on a time scale @xmath46 .    to get a feel for `` real life charm '' , we consider a simple numerical example . in gases where @xmath47 , the length - scales @xmath48 . in liquids",
    ", the situation is different and @xmath49 ( dimotakis ( 2005 ) , ( 1993 ) ) which means that @xmath50 .",
    "thus , while the scales @xmath45 and @xmath36 can be very different , the corresponding diffusion and viscous times scales @xmath51 are of the same order .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in various numerical and experimental studies ( see for example monin and yaglom ( 1975 ) ) that the relevant viscous scale @xmath52 is numerically larger than kolmogorov s one : @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the diffusion time is , in fact , @xmath55 .",
    "( the origin of the large factor @xmath56 will be discussed below . )      if @xmath57 , the process consists of two steps : 1 .",
    "formation of structures ( sheets ) on the viscous scale @xmath58 ;  2 .",
    "further stretching of the scalar fieled toward @xmath59 .",
    "it can be shown readily ( see monin and yaglom ( 1975 ) ) that , after initial formation of the dissipation scale @xmath52 , the distance between two particles across the sheets , stretched by the large - scale velocity field decreases with time as @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the scalar dissipation scale is formed on a time - scale @xmath61 given by the relation :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "this gives :    @xmath65    the diffusion time across scalar dissipation sheets is :    @xmath66    comparing the above relations we come to a non - trivial conclusion : although the characteristics times scale with the reynolds number as @xmath67 , the stretching process leading to both sheet thinning and increase of the scalar gradient competes with the simultaneous concentration - gradient - decreasing diffusion across the developing interfaces .",
    "however , due to the large magnitude of numerical factor @xmath54 , the process of the sheet - thinning by the large - scale stretching is numerically much faster than diffusion across the sheets .",
    "this means that during the stretching stage , the scalar diffusion across the interfaces can be neglected . _",
    "the factor @xmath54 will be calculated below and it will become clear that its large magnitude is a consequence of complex small - scale dynamics of intermittent turbulence . _    thus , the ratio of the mixing ( inviscid ) and diffusion times can be estimated as :    @xmath68    and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .    in the flows with @xmath71 , molecular diffusion across the dissipation sheets is the longest , rate - determining , process . in the wall flows , this reynolds number corresponds to @xmath72 .",
    "it is only when @xmath73 , the rapid diffusion through extremely thin interfaces , is dynamically irrelevant for the mixing process and inviscid mixing time @xmath38 is the rate - determining step .",
    "based on the above considerations , one can expect a transition from the diffusion- to advection - dominated mixing at    @xmath74    if mixing is the reaction rate ( @xmath75 ) determining process , we expect    @xmath76    in accord with ( 1.4 ) , the transitional reynolds number depends only upon coefficient @xmath56 , characterizing small - scale properties of turbulence .",
    "thus , we can conclude that , _ since the small - scale property of turbulence @xmath54 is a more or less universal number , independent upon type of the flow , the derived @xmath8 must be approximately universal . _",
    "a mixing transition leading to the reynolds - number - independent reaction rate at approximately universal reynolds number @xmath8 , has been observed in experiments by dimotakis ( 2005 ) , ( 1993 ) .",
    "the kolmogorov theory ( k41 ) , treating the u.v . cut - off @xmath77 , completely disregarded the non - trivial dynamics of the dissipation range fluctuations .",
    "it became clear recently that the dissipation scale is not a constant number but a random field defined as :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 . in this form",
    "the relation for @xmath80 was derived ( yakhot ( 2003 , ( 2006 ) ) , yakhot and sreenivasan ( 2004 ) , ( 2005 ) ) from the dissipation anomaly , first introduced by polyakov ( 1995 ) for the case of burgers turbulence and later generalized to the navier - stokes turbulence by duchon and robert ( 2000 ) , eyink ( 2003 ) .",
    "even earlier , the fluctuating dissipation scale was used by paladin and vulpiani ( 1987 ) in the context of multifractal theory the local value of the reynolds number @xmath81 , with @xmath82 as a typical speed of an eddy of linear dimension @xmath80 , was mentioned in landau and lifshitz as a criterion for the onset of viscous dissipation , as early as 1959 .",
    "the physical meaning of the dissipation scale @xmath80 is understood as follows .",
    "as @xmath83 , the velocity field is analytic , so that @xmath84 .",
    "thus , in this limit @xmath85 . on the other hand , in the inertial range @xmath86 which , contradicting small - scale analyticity of velocity field , can not be valid in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , in isotropic and homogeneous turbulence , the dissipation rate @xmath87 is regularized by viscosity @xmath88 .",
    "this leads to the definition of the dissipation scale @xmath36 : @xmath89 and , since @xmath90 , to kolmogorov s estimate for @xmath91 .",
    "based on the above considerations , defined by ( 2.1 ) , @xmath80 is a scale separating analytic ( @xmath92 ) and singular ( @xmath93 ) contributions to turbulent velocity field .",
    "the relation ( 2.1 ) is an order of magnitude estimate of the `` dissipation scale '' and , in general , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a velocity- field -independent factor which was investigated in numerical simulations by j. schumacher et .",
    "al . ( 2007 ) .",
    "interested in qualitative aspects of the mixing process , we , for now , neglect this coefficient and use expression ( 2.1 ) .    according to the theory ( yakhot ( 2003 ) ) , there exist an infinite number of `` dissipation scales '' @xmath96 separating smooth @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) and singular @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) intervals of the moments @xmath101 .",
    "this fact has been decisively demonstrated in numerical experiments of schumacher et al ( 2007 ) . according to the analytic theory ( yakhot ( 2003 ) ) , in general    @xmath102    where @xmath103 and the kolmogorov scale @xmath104 is only one of the possible dissipation scales .",
    "this property of turbulence will be important in what follows .",
    "let us consider an equation for concentration @xmath105 of a passive scalar advected by velocity @xmath106 :    @xmath107    we assume that the velocity field @xmath106 is governed by the navier - stokes equations and @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 corresponding to quasy - regular ( sometimes time - dependent ) and chaotic ( turbulent ) contributions , respectively .",
    "the fluctuations of the scalar dissipation field @xmath111 , governed by ( 2.2 ) , have been investigated in great detail for the case of the @xmath112-correlated in time , large - scale , velocity field ( kraichnan - batchelor problem ) , where the stretched exponential tail of the distribution function @xmath113 was derived in the range @xmath114 ( chertkov et .",

    "we are interested in statistical properties of `` molecular diffusion sheets '' , which are not directly related to the tails of the scalar dissipation rate distribution .",
    "the scalar field is analytic , so that for @xmath83 , @xmath115 .",

    "the length scale @xmath122 is the scale separating analytic and singular contributions to the scalar field @xmath123 . as follows from ( 2.3 ) , in the inertial range , the scalar field @xmath124 is not differentiable and in the limit @xmath125 , one has to be careful with evaluation of spatial derivatives of the scalar field .    from the equaion ( 2.2 )",
