    "qpos are highly coherent lorentzian peaks observed in the x - ray power spectra of compact objects in lmxrbs .",
    "they cover a wide range of frequencies ( from mhz to khz ) and they show up alone , in pairs or in triplets . in the present review we focus on khz qpos which occur in pairs ( the so called twin peak qpos ) .",
    "many models have been proposed in order to understand khz qpos : some of them involve orbital motions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , but there are also models that are based on accretion disk oscillations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . here",
    "we present semi - analytical results , connected in particular with the kluniak&abramowicz model .",
    "high frequency ( khz ) qpos lie in the range of orbital frequencies of circular geodesics just few schwarzschild radii outside the central source .",
    "moreover the frequencies scale with @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the central object @xcite .",
    "these two facts support the strong gravity orbital oscillations models .",
    "+ consider a test particle rotating around a compact source : the radial epicyclic frequency of planar motion and the vertical epyciclic frequency of nearly off - plane motion are respectively defined as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the effective potential and @xmath4 are spherical coordinates .",
    "the eigenfrequencies depend only on the metric of the system , hence on strong gravity itself . in newtonian gravity",
    "there is degeneracy between these eigenfrequencies and the keplerian frequency ( all three frequencies are equal ) while in general relativity this degeneracy is broken and as a consequence two or three different characteristic frequencies are present , opening the possibility of internal resonances . as a consequence , while newtonian orbits are all close , in gr they do not close after one loop ( this is for the same reason as the well - known advance of the perihelion of mercury ) .",
    "+ for a spherically symmetric gravitating fluid body ( a better model of the accretion disk ) these are the frequencies at which the center of mass ( initially on a circular geodesic ) oscillates .",
    "qpos often occur in pairs , and the centroid frequencies of these pairs are in rational ratio ( e.g.@xcite ) : these features suggested that high frequency qpos are a phenomenon due to non - linear resonance , and that there may be an analogy between the radial and vertical oscillations in a shakura - sunyaev disk and the motion of a pendulum with oscillating point of suspension ( @xcite ) . since in gr @xmath5",
    "the first allowed resonance would appear for @xmath6 and it would be the strongest .",
    "+ in all four microquasars which exhibit double peaks , the ratio of the two frequencies is @xmath7 , as well as in many neutron star sources .",
    "moreover combinations of frequencies and subharmonics have been detected : these are all signatures of non - linear resonance and they confirm the validity of the model .      a mathematical toy - model for the kluniak - abramowicz resonance idea for qpos was recently developed @xcite .",
    "it describes the qpos phenomenon in terms of two coupled non - linear forced oscillators ,    @xmath8    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are polynomes of second or higher degree ( obtained in terms of expansion of the deviations from a keplerian flow ) .",
    "the @xmath12 terms represent an external forcing : they are mostly important in the case of ns , where @xmath13 can be the ns spin frequency . @xmath14 and @xmath15 describe the stochastic noise due to the magneto - rotational instability . + in absence of turbulence , the first finding , which can be derived by using any perturbative method , is that in the approximate solution there are terms with the denominators in the form @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being integers ) .",
    "these @xmath17 and @xmath18 can not take any value , but they depend on the symmetry of the metric and of the perturbation : for a plane symmetric configuration one can demonstrate ( e.g.@xcite,@xcite ) that @xmath19 ( @xmath20 integer ) . due to this ,",
    "the regions where @xmath21 are candidate regions of internal resonance , and the strongest one would be for @xmath22 ( a similar reasoning can be done for the forcing term ) .",
    "a well known property of weakly non - linear oscillators is the fact that the frequencies of oscillation ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) depend on the amplitudes , even if their value remains close to that of the eigenfrequencies ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "perturbative methods help us again ( e.g. @xcite ) : indeed one can write    @xmath27    and find the frequencies corrections ( @xmath28 ) by constraining the solution to be stationary at a given timescale ( of the order of @xmath29 ) . for small perturbations one would get that @xmath30 .",
    "in this way one can qualitatively explain the observed linear correlation between the twin frequencies in ns sources : the example of the ns source sco x-1 was studied by @xcite and@xcite ( see fig.[reb : fig1 ] ) .    ) and slopes ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the points correspond to the individual z and atoll sources listed in @xcite .",
    "the best fit line goes through the point @xmath32 ( courtesy of gabriel trk).,height=3 ]    ) and slopes ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the points correspond to the individual z and atoll sources listed in @xcite .",
    "the best fit line goes through the point @xmath32 ( courtesy of gabriel trk).,height=3 ]    a direct consequence of the internal resonance is the fact that for different sources the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath33 should be nearly linearly anticorrelated ( @xcite ) : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a function which depends on the mass of the central object .",
    "note that at higher orders the relation is expected to slightly deviate from linearity : anyway up to now this feature fits very well the available data ( see fig.[reb : fig2 ] ) .",
    "accretion disks are characterized by a huge number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the turbulent processes can be assumed to have a stochastic nature . in particular , we have investigated a simplified model for the kluniak - abramowicz nonlinear theory and showed that a small noise in the vertical direction can trigger coupled epicyclic oscillations ( see fig.[reb : fig3 ] and [ reb : fig4 ] ) . on the other hand too much noise",
    "would disrupt the quasi - periodic motion @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the stochastically excited p - modes in the sun , and it may help in estimating the strength and the nature of the turbulence itself .",
    "non - linear parametric resonances occur everywhere in nature : together with gr they could explain the mechanism at the basis of khz qpos . in this way the mass and the angular momentum ( e.g.@xcite ) of the central compact object could be precisely measured , but most of all einstein s strong gravity could be proved : a good motivation to keep on investigating on this puzzling phenomenon ."
