    "the `` century survey '' ( cs ) is a complete redshift survey of 102 square degrees to a limiting m@xmath1 = 16.13 containing 1762 galaxies .",
    "it complements the suite of sparse surveys to comparable or greater depth ( @xcite : apm ; @xcite : lcrs ) .",
    "the sample size is comparable with that of the much deeper , complete eso key program of 23.3 square degrees ( @xcite ; @xcite : eso - kp ) .",
    "the cs covers the central 1@xmath0-wide declination range of the first slice of the cfa survey ( @xcite ) . in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "the cs is the largest complete survey to its depth .",
    "the qualitative features of the survey ( plate 1 ) are similar to the structures in other large redshift surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the survey slices through a number of large voids and dense , coherent , thin walls ( including a portion of the great wall ) .",
    "an outer region of the coma cluster ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 km s@xmath4 ; @xcite ) and a portion of the classical corona borealis supercluster ( @xmath11 ; see @xcite ; @xcite ) lie within the cs : these regions contribute prominent `` fingers '' in redshift space .",
    "note that throughout this paper we use b1950 coordinates .    like the cfa and ssrs2 surveys ,",
    "the cs is complete to its magnitude limit .",
    "although they cover more than a third of the sky , the cfa and ssrs2 surveys contain structures which extend across most of the sample volume .",
    "one might expect that because of the greater depth of the cs , individual large features ( like the great wall ) would be less likely to dominate its large - scale structure statistics .",
    "however , the 12,800 km s@xmath4 scale claimed by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and the excess power on a scale of @xmath12 mpc in the lcrs ( @xcite ) suggest caution ( see section 2b ) .",
    "in fact , within the cs , we find further evidence for inhomogeneity on a @xmath12 mpc scale .    here",
    "we display the data and discuss the first analyses of the cs .",
    "section 2 describes the survey . in section 3",
    "we compute the @xmath13-band luminosity function for the entire survey .",
    "we also examine the variation of the galaxy number density with redshift .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "the cs is a complete photometric and spectroscopic survey of the region @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the spectroscopic survey is 98.4% complete to @xmath16 over the entire right ascension range .",
    "we are 99.4% complete to @xmath17 over the right ascension range @xmath18 to @xmath19 . in this deeper sample ,",
    "there are 518 galaxies ; 177 of these have @xmath20 . here",
    "we discuss the sample complete to @xmath16 .",
    "kurtz et al . ( 1997 ) discuss the deeper sample .",
    "we constructed the galaxy catalog from scans of the poss e plates according to the procedures outlined by kurtz et al .",
    "( 1985 ) . for each galaxy in the catalog we derive an isophotal magnitude to a bright limiting isophote which varies unavoidably from plate to plate .",
    "two drift scans from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and from @xmath23 to @xmath24 provide the magnitude calibration ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the drift scans are both centered at @xmath25 .",
    "the drift scan for early @xmath26 s was done with the 1.2-m telescope and for late @xmath26 s with the 61-cm telescope ( now retired ) of f. l. whipple observatory ( flwo ) .",
    "we used pointed observations to calibrate the three poss plates e924 , e1365 , and e134 which cover the right ascension ranges @xmath27 to @xmath28 and @xmath29 to @xmath30 ( see the next paragraph ) .",
    "calibration details are in kurtz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    as a function of right ascension , figure 1 ( lower panel ) shows the difference , @xmath31 , between the drift scan magnitudes , @xmath32 , and the drift - scan calibrated cs , @xmath33 , for the 457 galaxies in common . to calibrate each plate",

    "more than 200 pointed observations with the mdm 2.4-m and 1.3-m telescopes under photometric conditions .",
    "the photometry for these observations is better than 3% in all cases .",
    "comparison of these large aperture pointed magnitude measurements with the drift scans demonstrates that there are no systematic zero - point variations across either drift ( see kurtz et al .",
    "1997 for further details ) .",
    "figure 1 ( upper panel ) shows the difference between 92 pointed photometric observations and the drift - scan calibrated cs as a function of right ascension . except for three plates noted above ( where we calibrate with these pointed observations only )",
    ", the pointed photometry provides an independent check of the cs drift scan calibration .",
    "the rms scatter in @xmath37 is 0.19@xmath38 and the median zero - point offset is @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40 s are the magnitudes for the pointed observations .",
    "the scatter here is an underestimate of the error in the cs photometry because we have not made a detailed accounting of the photometric errors for objects which are not cleanly separated from their neighbors .",
    "based on these considerations , we take 0.25@xmath38 as the standard error in the cs magnitudes",
    ".    there are 1762 galaxies with m@xmath41 .",
    "only 28 of these do not have measured redshifts .",
    "most of the galaxies without redshift measurements are near the limiting magnitude and their inclusion in the survey is largely a result of final refinement of the magnitude calibration .",
    "we measured 1467 new redshifts ; we measured 631 of these with the decaspec ( @xcite ) mounted on the mdm 2.4-meter . in sparser regions , where the ten - fiber probe decaspec would have been ineffective , we measured 774 redshifts either with the blue channel of the mmt spectrograph ( with image intensified reticon detectors ) or with the red or blue channel mmt spectrograph ( equipped with ccd detectors ) .",
    "the remaining redshifts are from single - slit 2.4-meter measurements or from fast spectrograph ( @xcite ) observations at the 1.5-meter tillinghast at flwo .",

    ", we derive redshifts with a multiple - gaussian fitting routine . for the more recent mmt red and blue channel data",
    ", we used the cross - correlation technique for both emission- and absorption - line spectra . at dartmouth",
    ", we used the reduce / interact package ( @xcite ) to extract redshifts ; at the cfa we used emsao and xcsao ( @xcite ) . for all of the data ,",
    "the typical error in the velocities is 70 km s@xmath4 . from 67 measurements in common , the zero - point offset between the mdm and mmt data is @xmath42 km s@xmath4 .",
    "one of us ( g. wegner ) used a 30 power loupe to obtain hubble types from glass copies of the poss1 o - plates ( the coarse classification bins are e , s0 , sa , sb , sc , irr and the corresponding barred types ) for all of the galaxies with m@xmath41 . from galaxies which appear on more than one plate , we estimate that the classification error is @xmath431 type . the median type in this @xmath13-selected survey is sa .",
    "we describe and analyze the classifications in much greater detail in kurtz et al .",
    "( 1977 ) .",
    "we make two corrections to the computed absolute magnitudes :    @xmath44    where m is the apparent @xmath13 magnitude from the photometric catalog , @xmath45 is the luminosity distance in megaparsecs at redshift @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the @xmath13-band @xmath48-correction for hubble type @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the extinction at @xmath13 .",
    "we correct for galactic extinction using the reddening maps of burstein and heiles ( 1982 ) and a ratio of total to selective absorption of @xmath51 .",
    "the majority of the survey galaxies lie at high galactic latitude ; the largest absorption correction is 0.09 magnitudes .",
    "we determine k - corrections for each galaxy type using the spectral synthesis models of rocca - volmerange and guiderdoni ( 1988 ) . at the chosen redshift limit of the survey , @xmath52 , these k - corrections range from @xmath53 magnitudes for irregulars to 0.2 magnitudes for ellipticals .",
    "we compute distances directly from the galaxy redshifts in the local group frame :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 . to facilitate comparisons with earlier work , we use @xmath56 km s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 with @xmath57 .",
    "we assume a mass density @xmath58 ( consistent with several recent measurements ) and zero cosmological constant : thus the deceleration parameter is @xmath59 .",
    "plate 1 shows the distribution of the cs galaxies with @xmath60 km s@xmath4 color - coded by morphological type .",
    "blue signifies types sa and later ; yellow corresponds to the early types e and s0 .",
    "regions occupied by both early and late types are gray - green .",
    "three qualitative results are evident in the map .",
    "first , both early- and late - type galaxies trace the large - scale features in the survey .",
    "this result is also evident in the two slices of the cfa2 survey for which types are available ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , the few galaxies within the lowest density regions ( voids ) tend to be of late - type , but there are _ some _  e s and s0 s . in a shallower survey of the first cfa slice , thorstensen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) also noted the presence of early - type galaxies in low density regions .",
    "finally , the cores of rich clusters are rich in early - type galaxies .",
    "portions of the central fingers appear dark green in plate 1 because the cores are surrounded by late - type galaxies ( a few are within the core ) which generally have a more extended distribution also visible in plate 1 .",
    "the superposition of early and late types at the same position produces the gray - green dots .",
    "these effects are already well known from detailed studies of individual clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cs contains portions of 7 abell clusters ( a690 , a1185 , a1213 , a1656 , a2079 , a2162 , and a2175 ) .",
    "the prominent `` finger '' at @xmath61 is part of the coma cluster ; its center is south of the survey boundary at @xmath62 .",
    "the cluster a2079 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65  km s@xmath4 ) is one of the six clusters in the classical corona borealis supercluster ( cor bor ) .",
    "the other five clusters ( a2061 , a2065 , a2067 , a2089 , and a2092 ) are outside the declination range of the cs .",
    "these systems span the right ascension range @xmath66 and the approximate velocity range 18,000 - 25,000 km s@xmath4 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this velocity range ,",
    "the cs is surprisingly dense all the way from 14.5@xmath67 to 16.5@xmath67 . at the median redshift of cor bor ( @xmath68 km s@xmath4 , which also happens to be the depth , d@xmath69 , to which an l@xmath69 galaxy is brighter than the magnitude limit )",
    ", the dense region has an extent of @xmath12 mpc , comparable with the scale where excess power is detected in the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; @xcite ) .",
    "counts in the cells marked in plate 1 give a measure of the extent of cor bor and of its contrast with other portions of the cs . in the easternmost cell with velocity range 15,000 to 30,000 km",
    "s@xmath4 , there are 348 galaxies ( only 92 of these are in the canonical @xmath70 cor bor range ) . in this velocity range the counts in the other three cells from east to west",
    "are , respectively : 214 , 184 , and 141 .",
    "in the cell which contains cor bor , the galaxy number density is @xmath71 times the overall median .",
    "the east - west gradient does not persist throughout the velocity range of the survey and thus it is not a result of an undiscovered systematic error in the photometry . in fact , we compute ( section 3 ) the luminosity function parameters for the eastern and western halves of the survey ; all three parameters ( the amplitude , characteristic luminosity , and faint - end slope ) are indistinguishable at the 1@xmath72 level .",
    "there are several recent surveys containing @xmath73 1000 galaxies which yield determinations of the local luminosity function .",
    "they include loveday et al .",
    "( 1992 : apm ) , marzke et al .",
    "( 1994a , b : cfa2 ) , da costa et al .",
    "( 1994 : ssrs2 ) , shectman et al .",
    "( 1996 : lcrs ) , ellis et al .",
    "( 1996 : autofib ) , and zucca et al .",
    "( 1997 : eso - kp ) .",
    "the apm , cfa2 , ssrs2 , autofib , and esokp are all blue - selected surveys . like the cs ,",
    "the lcrs is red - selected ( at gunn @xmath74 rather than at the kron - cousins @xmath13 we use ; @xmath75 ; jorgensen 1994 ) .",
    "there should be some variation in the _ shape _ of the luminosity function with color because of the expected associated change in morphological mix .",
    "the cs luminosity function parameters are thus most directly comparable with the lcrs . for comparison with @xmath76-selected surveys ,",
    "the median is @xmath77 for the cs mix of morphological types ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we use the sty maximum - likelihood ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and stepwise maximum likelihood ( @xcite : swml ) techniques to determine the parameters m@xmath69 and @xmath26 in the schechter ( 1976 ) function : @xmath78^{(1+\\alpha)}{\\rm exp } [ 10^{0.4(m^*-m)}].\\ ] ]    both methods are inhomogeneity - independent .",
    "we assume that the luminosity function is independent of position .",
    "thus we can determine its form and amplitude , @xmath79 , separately .",
    "the sty method is parametric ; the swml method provides a measure of the goodness of fit for the sty parameters , @xmath80 and @xmath26 .",
    "the _ observed _ luminosity function @xmath81 is a convolution of the magnitude error distribution with the _ true _ luminosity function of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we assume that the magnitude error distribution is gaussian with a dispersion of @xmath82 .",
    "we construct the luminosity function for @xmath83 the lower limit eliminates regions where peculiar velocities may be a large fraction of the cosmological recession velocity ; the upper limit is where the survey becomes too sparse to be useful .",
    "figure 2 shows the binned sty ( curve ) and swml ( symbols with error bars ) estimates of the _ observed _ ( convolved ) luminosity function for the entire cs sample .",
    "inversion of the information matrix yields the error bars on the swml estimates ( @xcite ) .",
    "marzke et al .",
    "( 1994a ) describe this approach in detail .",
    "the inset in figure 2 shows the 1@xmath72 error ellipse for the schechter ( 1976 ) function parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath6 derived from the sty technique . with @xmath84 , @xmath85 is coincident with @xmath86 ( table 1 ; the open box within the inset shows the best - fit lcrs parameters ) .",
    "however , the cs faint - end slope is significantly ( @xmath87 ) steeper than @xmath88 .",
    "the source of this discrepancy is unclear .",
    "one possibility is that the selection criteria used in the lcrs bias the survey against the faintest galaxies . because of the correlation between absolute magnitude and surface brightness , the central surface - brightness cut in the lcrs is the criterion most likely to eliminate galaxies from the faint end of the lf .",
    "the effect may , in fact , be small , but it remains to be evaluated .",
    "although our survey ( as any magnitude - limited survey ) is biased to high surface brightness galaxies as well ( kurtz et al . 1997 ) , we avoid explicit cuts on anything but apparent @xmath13 magnitude .",
    "this difference in survey strategy between the cs and the lcrs may contribute to the discrepancies at the faint end of the lf .",

    "1997 ) and in the autofib surveys ( ellis et al . 1996 , for the regime @xmath107 ) , both of which are selected in @xmath76 .",
    "the agreement between our @xmath13-selected survey and recent blue - selected surveys would be surprising if the early - type luminosity function were radically different from the late - type luminosity function . in the very local @xmath108-selected samples ,",
    "the early - type luminosity function is essentially indistinguishable from the spiral luminosity function ( ssrs2:marzke et al .",
    "1997 , cfa2 : marzke et al . 1994 ) .",
    "at redder wavelengths , the luminosity function of red , early - type galaxies must then be brighter than the luminosity function of blue , late types . because late types outnumber early types by a factor of nearly two , the overall luminosity function develops a feature around the knee in bandpasses where the color differential between early and late types exceeds a magnitude or so . in the @xmath13 band ,",
    "the color difference between ellipticals and sbc s is only half a magnitude .",
    "the net effect is that in the @xmath13-band , the early - type galaxies determine m@xmath69 ; late types still govern the faint - end .",

    "we translate these @xmath108-selected luminosity functions to the @xmath13 band using the mean @xmath118 colors from frei and gunn ( 1995 ) .",
    "we do not account for the large intrinsic scatter in the color for each morphology . for ellipticals , sbc s ( roughly the mean spiral type in ssrs2 ) and irregulars ,",
    "the colors are 1.39 , 0.95 and 0.57 , respectively .",
    "we adjust the normalization by the ratio of @xmath119 to compare the shapes directly .",
    "the predicted @xmath13-band luminosity function agrees remarkably well with the cs luminosity function .",
    "gardner et al . ( 1997 ) determined the galaxy luminosity function for a k - band survey . here too , the faint - end slope , @xmath120 , is nearly flat .",
    "because late spirals and ellipticals differ in @xmath121 by more than two magnitudes , the early and late - type luminosity functions are well separated at @xmath48 .",
    "the composite luminosity function may reflect this separation .",
    "we also compute luminosity functions for the east and west halves of the photometric cs ( the division is at @xmath122 ) . to within the errors ,",
    "all of the luminosity function parameters for the subsamples and for the survey as a whole are similar .",
    "the inset of figure 2 shows the error ellipses for the east ( dashed ) and west ( dotted ) samples .",

    "figure 3 shows the behavior of @xmath123 as a function of velocity .",
    "the cor bor region ( section 2b ) causes the peak at @xmath124 24,000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the peak centered at 9,000 km s@xmath4 is the great wall , bounded by a few large voids in its foreground and background .",
    "examination of plate 1 shows that the fluctuations at @xmath125 km s@xmath4 result from a small number of large - scale features .    in figure 3 ,",

    "the behavior of @xmath123 is similar to that of the eso - kp ( table 1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the 1@xmath72 limits provide a cautionary note .",

    "the cs samples a region of the universe completely disjoint from those sampled by the other surveys to comparable depth .",
    "like other recent redshift surveys to comparable depth , the cs indicates that the sparse apm survey and shallower surveys like the ssrs2 underestimate the absolute normalization of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "this local underestimate probably results from large - scale structure , but the details remain unclear .",

    ", the cs indicates that the absolute normalization of the luminosity function exceeds estimates based on shallower and/or sparser surveys .",
    "the lcrs indicates that there are inhomogeneities in the galaxy distribution on a scale of 100@xmath130 mpc .",
    "the century survey covers too small a volume to provide a comparable measure , but it does cross the corona borealis supercluster . this system is embedded in a dense region much more spatially extensive than the classical supercluster .",
    "the galaxy number density exceeds the mean by @xmath129 on a scale of @xmath131 mpc .",

    "<S> the `` century survey '' ( cs hereafter ) is a complete redshift survey of a 1@xmath0-wide strip . </S>",
    "<S> it covers 0.03 steradians to a limiting m@xmath1 = 16.13 . </S>",
    "<S> the survey is 98.4% complete and contains 1762 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> large - scale features in the survey are qualitatively similar to those in other surveys : there are large voids surrounded or nearly surrounded by thin dense regions which are sections of structures like ( and including ) the great wall .    </S>",
    "<S> the survey crosses the classical corona borealis supercluster . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy density enhancement associated with this system extends for @xmath2 mpc ( the hubble constant is h@xmath3  km s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function parameters for the cs are : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7  mpc@xmath8mag@xmath4 . in concert with the eso key program ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the autofib ( @xcite ) surveys </S>",
    "<S> , the cs indicates that the absolute normalization of the luminosity function exceeds estimates based on shallower and/or sparser surveys . </S>"
