    "high - time resolution radio astronomy is entering a new era due to two developments .",
    "firstly , new radio telescopes are being built that combine very high instantaneous sensitivity with wide fields of view , as required for blind searches of short duration events of transient radio emission .",
    "secondly , high performance computing ( hpc ) enables us to process the data extremely quickly , providing the opportunity to discover and react to such events , enabling localization and classification .",
    "our quest to explore the dynamic nature of the radio sky is underpinned by the realization that bright , short duration radio bursts must originate from extreme physical processes taking place around compact sources .",
    "neutron stars offer prime examples of such phenomena , being reliable emitters of short duration ( typically 50  ms or less ) radio pulses @xcite .",
    "these signals are observed once per rotational period for the majority of ordinary pulsars , but can be as infrequent as a few pulses per day in the case of rotating radio transients ( rrats ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to neutron stars , a new class of extraordinary sources has been identified in high time resolution radio astronomy which highlights the importance of real - time processing .",
    "the first of these sources  that have now come to be known as fast radio bursts ( frbs )  was discovered by @xcite , who reported the detection of a burst using the parkes radio - telescope , with evidence supporting large , extragalactic distance . following this discovery , more such bursts",
    "have been detected @xcite .",
    "we stress that all these events except @xcite were discovered via offline processing of recorded data , therefore no immediate follow - up observations to localize them were possible .",
    "the origin of frbs is unclear .",
    "proposed explanations include flaring magnetars @xcite , binary neutron star mergers @xcite , gravitational collapse of neutron stars to black holes @xcite , emissions from companions of extragalactic pulsars @xcite , and at least one galactic proposition in the form of nearby flare stars @xcite .",
    "these associations can be strengthened or weakened by comparing the rates of these events to the observed rates of frbs .",
    "current best limits from the observed frbs are given by @xcite as 10@xmath4  sky@xmath1  day@xmath1 , or a volumetric rate of 10@xmath5  gal@xmath1  year@xmath1 .",
    "in general , an frb will be dispersed by the free electron content of the medium it propagates through . as a result ,",
    "the lower frequency components of a broadband burst arrive later than their high frequency counterparts , the delay at a given frequency @xmath6 being proportional to the line integral of the electron column density along the line of sight ( known as the dispersion measure ) and @xmath7 .",
    "there is some evidence that the dispersion measure ( dm ) of one of the aforementioned frbs  the @xcite burst  may be explained by the galactic distribution of electrons @xcite .",
    "if frbs are indeed extragalactic in origin , they can be used to quantify the ionized matter in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , thereby allowing us to determine the baryon content of the universe .",
    "this could help solve the long - standing ` missing baryon problem ' in cosmology , where there is a discrepancy between the observed and the expected quantities of baryons @xcite .",
    "answering this question is one of the science objectives of the square kilometre array ( ska * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there is an expectation that astrophysical bursts will emit across a broad range of radio frequencies",
    ". the observed signal - to - noise ratio of an frb can be maximized by correcting for the dispersion induced delays across the frequency band of a telescope , in a well established process from pulsar astronomy called dedispersion . in the specific context of a blind search for frbs , where the dm is not known , the main challenge is to perform the incoherent dedispersion transform on the data . by this , we mean the process of producing from time series of total power in a large number of narrow frequency channels , time series of total power over a large range of dm values , revealing potential frb candidates .",
    "this is a computationally expensive task , and performing it in real time requires specialized software running on high performance computers with accelerated hardware . in the last few years , implementations of the accelerated dedispersion",
    "transform that are capable of real - time processing of typical data streams have emerged @xcite and are gradually being applied to surveys .",
    "comprehensive arguments in favour of searching for individual bright and dispersed pulses have been present in the literature and applied in practice for many years ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "yet despite the discoveries mentioned above , we are still in the early stages of putting together a complete picture of the dynamic nature of the radio sky .",
    "the most up - to - date limits hitherto on fast transient sources at 150  mhz can be found in @xcite , who use the results of the lofar pilot pulsar survey ( lpps ) to derive an upper limit on the frb rate of 150 sky@xmath1 day@xmath1 .",
    "all aforementioned frbs have been discovered at a frequency around 1400  mhz .",
    "upper limits to the frb rate at different frequencies provide constraints on the luminosity distribution and the spectral characteristics . assuming the flux density spectra of frbs follow a power law , then @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the flux density of the burst as a function of frequency @xmath6",
    ", @xmath10 is the spectral index .",
    "low frequency frb surveys are also being carried out at the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) , a low frequency dipole array located in western australia operating between 80 and 300  mhz .",
    "@xcite suggest several expected frbs per observing week , providing a clear framework for estimating frb rates depending on their intrinsic spectral index and scattering properties .",
    "there is currently no published detection of an frb from the mwa in the literature .",
    "the low frequency array , lofar , is currently the most sensitive radio telescope in the world at frequencies between 30 and 250  mhz .",
    "it is a prototypical example of a ` next - generation radio telescope ' and a pathfinder towards the square kilometre array ( ska ) .",
    "the telescope is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "discovery of pulsars and fast transients is one of the key science goals of lofar , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "we present here details and first results of a programme to use one international lofar station to search for frbs , in an effort to characterize the dynamic nature of the radio sky at lofar frequencies . in this paper",
    ", we describe the system developed to conduct fast transient surveys and the results of the first survey .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec_sysdesc ]",
    ", we describe the project , including details of the hardware and software , and the signal processing algorithms , and in ",
    "[ sec_surv ] , we describe our survey for fast transients using artemis , before concluding in  [ sec_concl ] .",
    "we have put together the hardware and software that is required to continuously monitor the large lofar fields of view and detect frbs in real time using general purpose computing on graphics processing units ( gpus ) .",
    "the scientific potential and the technical challenge of real - time frb discovery were the prime motivating factors behind the advanced radio transient event monitor and identification system ( artemis ) project , with an emphasis on applying hpc techniques to data from next generation telescopes .",
    "the primary goals of the artemis project therefore consist of :    * enabling the science goals of the ska and its pathfinders in the area of surveys for new pulsars and exotic fast transients . * exploiting many - core technologies to minimize capital costs of hardware , whilst delivering energy - efficient solutions for streaming processing in radio astronomy .",
    "we use the high - band antennas ( hba ) of a single international lofar station , which consists of 96 dual - polarization antennas covering a frequency range between 110 and 250  mhz .",
    "the artemis installation currently uses four 12-core servers , each equipped with a single fermi nvidia gpu card located on site at the rawlings array in the uk ( a similar setup exists at the international lofar station in nanay , france and an artemis server for offline pulsar data processing exists in jlich , germany ) .",
    "the servers receive data through a broadband ( 10 gbps ) switch , which is also responsible for sending the data back to the lofar correlator in the netherlands , for normal operations of the international lofar telescope ( ilt ) .",
    "each lofar station generates a total of 3.2 gbps of beamformed data , which corresponds to a sky bandwidth of approximately 48  mhz using 16-bit sampling . the station beamformer produces a total of 244 beamlets each with the frequency and time resolution specified in table [ tab : specs ] .",
    "estimated values of the system equivalent noise are also given , for an observation with a total bandwidth of 6  mhz and time resolution of 327.68  @xmath11s , by scaling the sensitivity values , as given in table b.3 .",
    "of @xcite for a source at 30declination , to the aforementioned bandwidth and sample time . the sensitivity value quoted for 150  mhz",
    "is in good agreement with the value from the lpps survey @xcite using uncalibrated lofar stations , scaled to this survey .    for this survey , groups of 30 and 31",
    "beamlets are pointed in a single direction on the sky , covering contiguous frequency channels to form a total of 8 broadband ( @xmath12  mhz ) beams .",
    "these can be formed within a circle of @xmath1310 times the beamlet fwhm , due to the analog tile beamforming of lofar hba arrays described in @xcite .",
    ".[tab : specs ] specifications of an international lofar station [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     each artemis server receives and processes 2 out of the 8 formed beams , corresponding to a quarter of the total bandwidth .",
    "in addition to frb detection , real - time processing can be used to reduce the data rate from 400  mb / s to manageable rates both for storage and further processing , useful for other science goals .",
    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]    artemis provides an extendible and parallelisable software backend , which can process telescope data in real time , mainly for detecting frbs .",
    "the software , called ampp , is sufficiently generic to serve as an all - purpose telescope backend , which is built upon a c++ framework ( pelican ) , providing a fully configurable client - server architecture .",
    "the software pipelines consist of a number of c++ modules and configuration files for processing live telescope data .",
    "the modular design allows data processing tasks to be implemented independently of other considerations such as data acquisition , transport protocols , data output , and system deployment .",
    "the modules currently available include an implementation of a polyphase filter for raw ( coherent ) telescope data , a stokes - generating and integration module which converts the raw data to stokes parameters , a radio - frequency interference ( rfi , unwanted and often man - made signals ) rejection module which operates on incoherent data , an incoherent dedispersion transform module , and streaming modules that record data to disk and send the processed data via the network for further processing or recording .",
    "figure  [ fig : ampp ] shows a schematic of ampp . as shown , dedispersion is an asynchronous task which occurs only when sufficient data have been accumulated in a buffer .",
    "this task is also the most expensive in terms of computation , and therefore is accelerated using gpus .",
    "ampp uses the astroaccelerate dedispersion transform algorithm @xcite , which has been favourably benchmarked against other extremely fast implementations @xcite .      in aperture arrays such as lofar ,",
    "beamforming can require that spectral channels are formed in the raw digital data @xcite .",
    "this is achieved prior to beamforming via a polyphase filter followed by a fast fourier transform , which produces a number of raw - data frequency subbands .",
    "the channelisation requirements of the beamformer are generally different to those of the dedispersion transform , therefore an additional channelisation step is necessary within the software .",
    "incoherent dedispersion can not remove intra - channel dispersion . as a result ,",
    "the channel bandwidth should not exceed a certain limit , dictated by the maximum dm of a search and the minimum duration of the frbs being searched for . determining this limit is standard practice in pulsar and fast transient searches ( e.g. ,",
    "we have developed a multi - threaded polyphase filterbank module for ampp , which efficiently generates @xmath14 spectral channels for each input subband . the number of output channels , the windowing function , the number of taps for the filter and the number of processing threads dedicated to the module are configurable options . in our searches",
    "so far , we use a filter that provides frequency channels with a bandwidth of 3.0518 khz , by channelizing each incoming raw data subband into 64 channels .",
    "this increases the sample time from the original 5.12 @xmath11s to 327.68 @xmath11s .    within the ampp pipeline",
    ", the raw data are passed to a module which generates stokes parameters from the incoming complex polarisations , according to : @xmath15 where @xmath16 refers to the complex conjugate . in the dispersion searches for frbs described here , only stokes-@xmath17 ( total power )",
    "the software however provides the possibility to buffer all four stokes parameters .",
    "rfi is known to yield large numbers of false positives in pulsar searches @xcite .",
    "the dedispersion transform integrates total power over frequency , thereby removing all frequency resolved information .",
    "this imposes the requirement to clean the data of rfi before dedispersion .",
    "examples of rfi excision techniques for frb searches have been described in @xcite . for our survey , removing rfi in real - time imposes specific constraints both on the algorithm ( only information from the past data is available ) and on the processing .",
    "the adaptive thresholding algorithm that we developed for ampp performs the following steps :    1 .",
    "prior to any observation , the spectral bandpass is recorded using narrow frequency channels .",
    "individual bright channels are rejected through an iterative rejection process , and the clean bandpass is modelled using a low - order polynomial .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) of the bandpass noise is recorded .",
    "the search commences .",
    "3 .   within ampp",
    ", the total power data are processed by the rfi module one time sample at a time , consisting typically of a large number of spectral channels .",
    "the median of each time sample spectrum is computed , which is insensitive to outliers , and the bandpass model is adjusted to that level ( the zeroth order coefficient is set to the value of the spectrum mean ) .",
    "the power in each frequency channel is compared to the model at that frequency .",
    "if it exceeds a threshold @xmath18 , it is given a small weight ( in current implementations we set the weight to zero ) .",
    "@xmath18 is typically set to 6 times the rms of the current bandpass noise .",
    "the mean and rms of this ` cleaned ' spectrum are stored in a circular history buffer , which can hold values extended up to a duration much greater than the longest frb searched for .",
    "a running average of the history buffer is computed both for the model mean and the rms , ensuring that the model remains up - to - date when it is compared to the next observed spectrum , without being affected by short term variability .",
    "if the median value of the incoming spectrum reveals a large disagreement between the model and the spectrum , i.e. , a jump has occurred in the incoming spectra due to a broadband signal , the whole spectrum is assigned a low weight .",
    "the threshold @xmath19 is typically also set to 6 times the calculated rms of the median .",
    "if the number of consecutive spectra that do not agree with the model is equal to the size of the history buffer , the algorithm accepts that the bandpass model is no longer relevant to the data , and sets the mean and rms to the values of the last observed spectrum .",
    "finally , for the frb search , the bandpass model is removed from each flagged spectrum .",
    "ampp has a configuration setting that allows each spectrum to be scaled to maintain a uniform rms in the post - filtered data , which is very useful for the dedispersion transform .",
    "figure [ fig : rfi_clipper ] shows the effect of the rfi excision algorithm on 1.3 s of filterbank data from the rawlings array .",
    "the algorithm described above effectively flags broadband signals which raise the mean of the spectrum . in this example , the flagged data are replaced by gaussian noise matching the bandpass model used for the comparison .",
    "however , for the real - time frb searches , we set the weight of these data to zero , and replace them in the input to the dedispersion module with noise from a chi - squared distribution with four degrees of freedom . a narrowband ( and in this case frequency - swept ) signal of interference is also flagged , revealing two dispersed pulses of psr b0329 + 54 in the processed filterbank data on the right .",
    "the rfi excision module can also be set to remove the mean of every spectrum , effectively removing signals at 0 dm @xcite .",
    "the dedispersion module used in ampp was developed as part of the astro - accelerate library @xcite .",
    "this module performs the dedispersion transform between total power versus frequency and time , and total power versus dispersion measure and time .",
    "the software framework provides the infrastructure for setting up tasks on available gpus , and gpu dedispersion kernels are used during ampp processing .",
    "the details of the dedispersion process are beyond the scope of this paper and form the subject of a separate publication . together with the rfi - cleaned data , the mean and standard deviation of the baseline noise are also propagated through the software pipeline to facilitate the detection of statistically significant signals in the de - dispersed data .",
    "incoherent dedispersion is performed in steps of dm .",
    "for technical reasons , pertaining to the dedispersion algorithm on a gpu , we maintain a fixed @xmath20 dm step across the searched dm range .",
    "the dedispersion transform in our survey was therefore carried out at @xmath20 dm steps of 0.1  @xmath0 pc .",
    "this discretization results in some loss of signal due to intra - channel dispersion . @xcite",
    "provide a framework for estimating the signal loss given the dm step size , the centre frequency and bandwidth of the observations and the width of a gaussian pulse . using their equations 12 and 13 @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xmath0 pc",
    ", we estimate a loss in sensitivity of less than 15% for 2  ms wide pulses , which drops to 2.5% for a 5  ms pulse .",
    "regardless of prior beliefs on the origin of frbs , at a sky frequency of 145  mhz , interstellar scattering is a central consideration in the design of a search . @xcite",
    "compute an empirical relationship between the measured scattering timescale @xmath24 and the dm of a large number of pulsars .",
    "there is at least an order of magnitude uncertainty in the dm-@xmath24 relationship .",
    "scattering results in broadening of the intrinsic frb width , resulting in a smaller loss of sensitivity , as per eqs .",
    "[ eq : sovers ] and [ eq : zeta ] . to investigate relevant values of w@xmath25 we assume the worst case scenario",
    "as regards dedispersion ( i.e. , the least possible scattering per given dm ) .",
    "we therefore set @xmath26 to be an order of magnitude smaller than what is given by @xcite . in principle , the observed width of a radio pulse is given by the convolution of @xmath26 with the intrinsic width of the burst , although for simplicity , we derive the observed width as @xmath27 where the intrinsic width @xmath28 is defined in some reasonable way ( e.g. , fwhm ) .",
    "another factor that comes into play specifically for signals from cosmological distances is cosmological time dilation , which stretches the pulse by a factor of @xmath29 .",
    "however , as discussed in the following sections , @xmath30 is small in the case of the artemis survey , so this effect can be safely neglected .     for a @xmath31  mhz and @xmath32  mhz search for frbs with intrinsic width of 2 and 5  ms , given as a function of dm .",
    "the curve is computed using eqs .",
    "[ eq : sovers ] , [ eq : zeta ] , [ eq : width ] , and setting @xmath26 to be 10% of what is given by @xcite .",
    "regardless of the intrinsic frb width , @xmath33 is likely dominated by the scattering timescale @xmath26 above a certain dm , thus rendering the efficiency high even for low intrinsic widths .",
    "[ fig : ddmvdm],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in the lofar hba band at 145  mhz , there is a reasonable expectation that @xmath33 will be dominated by scattering above a certain dm .",
    "figure [ fig : ddmvdm ] shows the efficiency @xmath34 for a dm resolution @xmath20dm=0.1  @xmath0 pc , for frbs with an intrinsic width of 2 and 5  ms , based on the arguments above .",
    "the curves are characterised by a flat segment at the lowest dms , which indicates the dm range for which galactic scattering is unlikely to substantially broaden the pulse width ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the figure suggests that a dm resolution of @xmath36  @xmath0 pc maintains high efficiency even at low dm values .",
    "considering that frbs typically last a few milliseconds sets an upper limit to the dm value searched using incoherent dedispersion .",
    "the reason is that intra - channel dispersion becomes large with increasing dm value at these low frequencies .",
    "reducing the channel bandwidth is not an option , as it worsens the temporal resolution . for the channel bandwidth of 3.0518  khz ,",
    "the dm smearing at 145  mhz is 8.3@xmath37s per unit of dm .",
    "we have therefore chosen the maximum dm of our search to be 320  @xmath0  pc , corresponding to a maximum of 2.6  ms of intra - channel smearing . to search for higher",
    "dm frbs requires a step of coherent dedispersion , which would leave the temporal resolution unaffected .",
    "the artemis hardware is capable of processing at least 3200 dm values per data stream in real - time , which is sufficient given the dm resolution arguments above .",
    "in fact , this sampling of the dm space was also chosen to demonstrate the viability of the hardware and software , operating at near maximum load .",
    "dedispersed timeseries at neighbouring dm values will show some degree of correlation , however the threshold used for detection ( 10 times the noise rms , see the following section ) , precludes spurious detections caused by this effect .",
    "once the filterbank data have been converted to a time series per dm , these are decimated to 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 and 64 times the original sampling time , and , along with the original , searched in real time for significant peaks by applying a 5-sample median filter to preclude the detection of single , high s / n peaks .",
    "we are currently investigating adaptive filtering algorithms for computational and detection performance .",
    "we have currently concluded 1522  hours of drift - scan observations using the rawlings array .",
    "these observations were accompaniedfor the majority of the time by the french lofar international station at nanay .",
    "the purpose of the second station was to perform a coincidence test on potential detected frbs and rule out the possibility that they are caused by rfi .",
    "the array is configured to point 8 beams with a bandwidth of 6.055  mhz ( for odd - numbered beams ) and 5.859  mhz ( for even - numbered beams ) , to fixed positions in the sky on the local meridian , at declinations of 7.9 , 11 , 13.3 , 15.85 , 19 , 22 , 24.9and 28.66 , corresponding to declinations of known bright pulsars which we use as sanity checks .",
    "each beam is about 1.9wide , and the total amount of instantaneous sky coverage is 24 sq .",
    "our sensitivity is given by @xmath38 where 24.7  jy is the noise rms in each sample averaged across the band .",
    "this is computed by correcting the value given in table  [ tab : specs ] , by the average elevation of our beams ( 58 ) .",
    "furthermore , 10 is the threshold s / n ratio that we used , and @xmath39 is the decimation factor , compared to the native 327.68  @xmath11s time resolution .",
    "this makes us sensitive to a peak flux density @xmath40  jy for 5  ms - duration pulses .",

    "note that , given the other decimation factors we have searched for , our survey has multiple fluence limits , ranging from 81  jy  ms for d=1 ( pulse durations of 327@xmath11s ) and 650  jy  ms for d=64 ( pulse durations of 21  ms ) .",

    "the amount of time however that each of these galaxies was covered by the survey beams is @xmath50  yr , given the size and declination of the beams . assuming the frb volumetric rate in @xcite of 10@xmath5  gal@xmath1  yr@xmath1 , that leaves us with a single potential frb event in our survey .",
    "we therefore have to consider the possibility that no frb occurred during the survey .",
    "given the uncertainty in the relationship between dm and redshift , and given the uncertainty in the volumetric rates of frbs at the present day , it is useful to consider other possible reasons for the non - detection , such as the spectral index of frb emission .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : szalpha ] , where eq .  9 of @xcite is plotted for various values of the spectral index @xmath10 , and as mentioned in the previous section , spectral index affects the volume surveyed . for values of @xmath10",
    "less than -0.2 , the volume surveyed is dictated by the dm limit .",
    "for these values of @xmath10 , following the standard candle model , we expect to see all bursts up to @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rz ] reproduces the centre panel of figure  2 of @xcite up to @xmath52 , where the sky rate of bursts enclosed within a given volume is shown .",
    "the @xcite rate is marked by the white cross .",
    "our upper limit on the rate , of 29 bursts sky@xmath1  day@xmath1 , sits below the curve , and is marked by the red arrow . assuming that frbs occurred during our survey and given the caveats mentioned above , our null result",
    "could be explained by the most distant frbs being too weak to observe , due to their spectrum .",
    "this leads to the realization that the maximum redshift is not set by dm considerations , but rather by the spectral index . to estimate the new maximum redshift",
    ", we observe that our sky rate is compatible with the @xcite rate at a lower maximum redshift of 0.09@xmath53 .",
    "this is the redshift at which the curve of the scaled thornton rate of figure  [ fig : rz ] also becomes 29  sky@xmath1  day@xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : szalpha ] allows us to associate a spectral index to the new maximum redshift probed , and errors on that spectral index based on the errors on the maximum redshift . reading off figure  [ fig : szalpha ] , this line of thinking allows us to place a lower limit on the spectral index of 0.1@xmath54 .",
    "we must point out that this line of reasoning also reduces the effective volume of the survey to 3.3 @xmath47 10@xmath55 mpc@xmath42 , leaving approximately one third of the host galaxies we started off with that could host an frb . if , however , the true reason for our non - detection lies in the spectral properties rather than the volumetric rate , the implication is that the frb spectral index is distinct from that of most pulsars . in the case of pulsars , a steep ( negative )",
    "spectral index is thought to be indicative of a coherent emission process .",
    "the lack of such a steep spectrum in frbs would serve as a clue to the nature of their emission process , which could be intrinsically more narrow - band than pulsars , or characterized by a frequency dependent emission geometry .",
    "it is worth noting that two of the published frbs at this time have been observed to have a positive spectral index within the band of observation : a most likely value of @xmath10 between 7 and 11 , considering the frequency dependent telescope beam pattern , in @xcite , and @xmath56 in @xcite .",
    "estimating spectral indices within an observing band is difficult due to effects of scintillation and frequency dependent gain variation within the telescope beam .",
    "this latter effect is more likely to render the observed spectrum to have a more negative slope than its intrinsic slope .",
    "therefore , despite the small population of frbs with a positive spectral index , a consistent picture may be emerging .",
    "in estimating the frb spectral index from our survey we have assumed that frbs are extragalactic standard candles with broadband radio emission .",
    "we have also implicitly assumed that the volumetric rate of frbs , that reflects the rate per galaxy per year , is constant with redshift .",
    "we have not tested the standard candle hypothesis , while the volumetric rate may be a function of redshift , similar to the redshift dependent star formation rate .",
    "we have developed artemis , a gpu - based real - time fast transient detection system that works with individual lofar stations .",
    "we have used the deployment at the rawlings array to demonstrate the functionality and performance of the system using known pulsars .",
    "we conducted a 1446  hour drift - scan survey for frbs , searching the dm space up to 320  @xmath0 pc . with a series of arguments relating to sensitivity and the intrinsic spectra of frbs , and some simple assumptions about their nature",
    ", we estimate that we have surveyed a volume of @xmath57  mpc@xmath42 .",
    "no frb was detected in the survey at the rawlings array or indeed the nanay station , and we derive an upper limit of 29 frbs  sky@xmath1 day@xmath1 within the parameters of our search .",
    "the non - detection could be due to one or more of the following reasons : not enough volume surveyed for enough time , interstellar and intergalactic scattering , and the intrinsic spectra of frbs .",
    "assuming the latter , we have attempted to constrain the spectral index of frbs , to @xmath58 , assuming a standard candle model .",
    "the physical significance of this result is moderated by the fact that we can not rule out other causes of non - detection at the frequency of our survey , including the possibility that frbs are local events to the telescopes that have detected them .",
    "assuming that the non - detection is indeed due to the intrinsic shape of frb spectra , our result is constrained by the sensitivity of the rawlings array .",
    "this work has implications for future low frequency frb surveys .",
    "firstly , at frequencies around 145  mhz , longer duration surveys with increased telescope sensitivity could allow further constraints of the spectral index to even higher values , or detect frbs .",
    "it is however quite difficult to sample substantially more volume of universe , without running into greater potential scattering effects .",
    "secondly , moving up in frequency by a factor of 2 and increasing the sensitivity by two orders of magnitude , which will ultimately be interesting for the low frequency component of the square kilometre array , could allow surveys to probe redshifts upwards of @xmath30=1 .",
    "assuming scatter broadening is mainly due to propagation in the host galaxy and our galaxy , there is a reasonable expectation that it will not affect these predictions .",
    "this suggests that future high - sensitivity surveys at 300  mhz , should result in a reasonable yield of new frbs and should resolve the spectral index question .    for artemis",
    ", we are developing a commensal real - time system in collaboration with the berkeley seti research center , for the arecibo radio telescope .",
    "named alfaburst , this system will use the seven - beam @xmath59-band feed of the arecibo telescope to perform surveys for frbs , potentially increasing the sample size . in this system , we aim to incorporate multi - beam coincidence rejection that will reduce the number of false alarms , and automated triggering that will alert low - frequency telescopes in the event that an frb is detected .",
    "similar systems are being prepared for the south african ska pathfinders ( kat-7 and meerkat ) and for tied - array beams of the lofar international telescope that offer an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity .",
    "we would like to thank dr alex kraus and staff at the effelsberg radiotelescope for hosting us and our machines during early artemis development .",
