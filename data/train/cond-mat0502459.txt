    "in a recent paper @xcite we considered a class of stochastic processes defined by the equations @xmath8 where @xmath2 is gaussian white noise with mean zero and correlator @xmath9 . equations ( [ langevin1 ] ) and ( [ langevin2 ] ) represent a particle which diffuses ( performs a random walk ) in the @xmath0-direction but is subject to a deterministic drift in the @xmath3-direction with a @xmath0-dependent drift velocity .",
    "we consider the case where there is an absorbing boundary at @xmath6 , and we are interested in the survival probability of the particle .",
    "two previously studied models are the cases @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the former is equivalent to the random acceleration process , @xmath12 , while the latter is the ` windy cliff ' model introduced by redner and krapivsky @xcite .",
    "for both these models , the survival probability of the particle decays as @xmath13 for large time @xmath14 , and it has been argued @xcite that this is a generic result for odd functions @xmath7 . it should be noted that , in general , such problems are highly nontrivial and exact solutions are available in only a small number of cases .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", we raised the question of how the survival probability decays when the function @xmath7 is not an odd function .",
    "we considered a class of models where @xmath15 for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for @xmath18 . here",
    "the drift takes the particle away from the absorbing boundary for @xmath16 , and towards it for @xmath18 , but not in a symmetrical way : the function @xmath7 is odd only when @xmath19 . using an extension of a technique developed by burkhardt @xcite in connection with the random acceleration process , we showed that the survival probability decays as @xmath20 for large @xmath14 , where the exponent @xmath21 ( the ` persistence exponent ' ) is nontrivial and given by @xmath22 \\label{result}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 .",
    "this reduces to @xmath24 for @xmath19 but @xmath21 lies in the range @xmath25 in general . when @xmath26 , the drift away from the boundary is _ weakly",
    "_ dominant .",
    "the decay of the survival probability still has a power law form , but @xmath27 , while the converse occurs for @xmath28 : the drift toward the boundary is weakly dominant and @xmath29 .",
    "the fact that @xmath30 is an upper bound for @xmath21 is clear when one recalls that the probability that the particle stays in the region @xmath16 ( and therefore never encounters the drift towards the absorbing boundary ) decays as @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the process defined by eqs.([langevin1 ] ) and ( [ langevin2 ] ) is non - gaussian except when @xmath7 is linear .",
    "( [ result ] ) is a rare example of an exactly calculable persistence exponent for a non - gaussian process .    in @xcite",
    "we speculated about the behavior of the system when the function @xmath7 is described by different _",
    "exponents _ , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , for @xmath16 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "we argued that for @xmath34 the drift away from the boundary is _ strongly _ dominant , leading to a non - zero survival probability at infinite time ( i.e.  @xmath35 ) , while for @xmath36 the drift towards the boundary is strongly dominant and @xmath21 obtains its maximum value of @xmath30 .    in the present work we obtain some exact result pertinent to the latter question .",
    "looking at the case @xmath37 , we show explicitly that the survival probability approaches a non - zero value at infinite time and we obtain a closed - form expression for this value .",
    "in the second part of the paper we revisit the issue of whether the decay exponent @xmath21 takes the value @xmath38 for _ all _ odd functions @xmath7 , as has been assumed up to now .",
    "we consider models where the flow field takes a periodic , banded form with @xmath7 taking the values @xmath39 and @xmath40 in alternate bands of width @xmath41 , @xmath42 respectively .",
    "we demonstrate numerically that for the case @xmath43 and @xmath44 which , with appropriate cloice of the @xmath45 axis , represents an odd function , @xmath46 , not @xmath38 and we argue that @xmath47 whenever there is no net drift , i.e.  when @xmath48 . in these cases we argue that an effective diffusion in the @xmath3-direction , resulting from the stochastic movement between the alternating bands , dominates over the drift and naturally accounts for the exponent @xmath30 .",
    "we obtain an analytical result in the limit @xmath49 , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 held fixed and equal to @xmath52 , and we verify that @xmath47 in this case .",
    "the model we consider initially is defined by eqs .",
    "( [ langevin1 ] ) and ( [ langevin2 ] ) , with the function @xmath7 given by @xmath53 we work in the regime @xmath37 , where we expect a non - zero survival probability . the probability , @xmath54 that the particle survives to infinite time satisfies the backward fokker - planck equation ( bfpe ) @xmath55 . in the present context",
    "it is convenient to work instead with the ` killing probability ' , @xmath56 , which obviously satisfies the same equation , @xmath57 but with different boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary conditions on @xmath58 are @xmath59 the last of these following from the fact that , for an initial condition with @xmath6 and @xmath18 , the flow immediately takes the particle on to the absorbing boundary .    inserting the form ( [ f ] ) for @xmath7 in ( [ bfpe ] )",
    ", the equation can be solved separately in each regime by separation of variables . imposing the boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) the result takes the form ( setting @xmath60 for convenience ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 is a bessel function and @xmath64 a modified bessel function .",
    "( [ possoln ] ) and ( [ negsoln ] ) contain the three undetermined functions @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "these are sufficient to demonstrate our main claims .    to determine the small-@xmath72 behavior of @xmath65 we consider eq.([bc3app ] ) in the limit @xmath73 , since the integral is dominated by small values of @xmath72 in that limit .",
    "we make the ansatz @xmath74 then the small-@xmath72 forms of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are fixed by equations ( [ continuity1 ] ) and ( [ continuity2 ] ) . since @xmath75 , @xmath76 for @xmath77 , so the first term , involving @xmath66 , in eq .",
    "( [ bc3app ] ) dominates for large negative @xmath0 , and the term involving @xmath67 is negligible . in this limit , therefore , eq .",

    "( [ a ] ) : @xmath81    inserting the small-@xmath72 results for @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 in eqs .",
    "( [ possoln ] ) and ( [ negsoln ] ) determines @xmath58 in the entire regime where @xmath3 or @xmath0 ( or both ) are large .",
    "especially simple is the limit of large @xmath3 at @xmath45 , where one obtains @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "this result demonstrates that there is a non - zero infinite - time survival probability provided @xmath84 , i.e.  @xmath85 .",
    "the spatial decay exponent , @xmath86 , should have ( we feel ) a simple physical derivation , but so far it has eluded us .",
    "in the remaining part of this paper we consider the case where @xmath7 is a periodic function of @xmath0 , with period @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , we consider the case @xmath88 for all integers @xmath89 .",
    "this function @xmath7 is odd , but we shall show that the survival probability decays asymptotically as @xmath31 .",
    "we first present , in figure [ fig1 ] , the result of a numerical simulation for different values of the width , @xmath90 , of the alternating bands . in each case the particle is initially located at @xmath6 , on the interface between two bands . to avoid immediate absorption ,",
    "the first step is taken into the band with positive velocity .",
    "for early times , @xmath91 , the particle explores the two bands either side of the initial position and the decay exponent @xmath38 , appropriate to infinitely wide bands is obtained . at time",
    "@xmath92 , however , where the particle starts to explore many bands , there is a clear crossover from the initial @xmath13 decay to an asymptotic @xmath31 decay .    to understand these results , we first recall the use of the sparre anderson theorem @xcite to demonstrate that @xmath93 for odd functions @xmath7 .",
    "first suppose that @xmath94 for @xmath16 and @xmath95 for @xmath18 .",
    "we focus on crossings of the @xmath3-axis and regard the steps between crossings as the elementary steps of a one - dimensional random walk on the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the steps are clearly ( i ) independent , and ( ii ) drawn from a symmetric distribution .",
    "the sparre anderson theorem states that the probability that the process has not crossed the absorbing boundary at @xmath6 after @xmath96 steps decays as @xmath97 for large @xmath96 . since the number of crossings in time @xmath14 scales as @xmath98 , this implies @xmath99 .",
    "let us examine this argument more carefully .",
    "it s validity clearly requires that a crossing of the absorbing boundary at @xmath6 can occur at most once between two consecutive crossings of the @xmath3-axis",
    ". this will always be the case if @xmath7 takes only one sign for @xmath16 and the other sign for @xmath18 . in the periodic case",
    ", however , @xmath7 takes both signs for @xmath16 and both signs for @xmath18 .",
    "the process can therefore cross the absorbing boundary , from @xmath100 to @xmath101 , and cross back again _ without _ crossing the @xmath3-axis .",
    "such absorption process will be missed in a description which focuses only on crossings of the @xmath3-axis .",
    "such a description will typically underestimate the value of @xmath21 ( it gives a lower bound on @xmath21 ) .    a better way of looking at this problem is as follows .",
    "the probability @xmath102 that the particle survives until time @xmath14 , given that it started at @xmath103 , is periodic with period @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , the partial derivative @xmath104 vanishes by symmetry at the center of any band .",
    "it therefore suffices to solve the problem in the region @xmath105 , @xmath106 , which defines a semi - infinite strip , with boundary conditions @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "the flow velocity is @xmath109 in the upper part of the strip ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath110 in the lower part .",
    "this strip problem has been discussed by redner and krapivsky @xcite , who argue as follows .",
    "the typical time between crossings of the center line , @xmath45 , is @xmath111 .",
    "the typical distance travelled , in the @xmath3-direction , in this time is @xmath112 .",
    "the two cases @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where @xmath3 is the initial displacement of the particle , have to be analysed separately .",
    "the following discussion is based on reference @xcite .",
    "the crossings of the @xmath3-axis define a symmetric one - dimensional random walk with step length @xmath115 and time step @xmath116 .",
    "the effective diffusion constant for motion in the @xmath3-direction is , therefore , @xmath117 .",
    "the survival probability for this random walk is given by the well - known result @xcite @xmath118 note that the @xmath0-dependence is not determined by this argument .",
    "it is intuitively clear , however , that the result is insensitive to @xmath0 at large @xmath3 .    comparing this result with figure [ fig1 ]",
    ", we note that the amplitude of the @xmath31 behaviour in the late - time regime increases with increasing @xmath90 in figure [ fig1 ] , whereas eq.([1d ] ) predicts a decreasing amplitude with increasing @xmath90 .",
    "the data , however , were obtained with the initial @xmath3 equal to zero ( with @xmath119 after one time step ) . to make meaningful comparisons with the data , therefore , we need to analyse the opposite regime @xmath114 .      for @xmath114",
    ", one can argue as follows . at short times , @xmath120",
    ", the behaviour will be the same as for strips of infinite width , @xmath121 @xcite . at later times",
    ", this result will be modified by a function of @xmath122 , @xmath123 . for @xmath124 , there should be a crossover to the @xmath31 decay calculated above , since if the particle survives for time @xmath125 , it will typically reach a distance @xmath126 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath127 therefore behaves as @xmath128 for large @xmath129 , giving @xmath130 the two results eqs .",
    "( [ 1d ] ) and ( [ 1d ] ) match , as required , at @xmath131 , where both reduce to @xmath132 .",
    "the scaling form @xmath133 is tested in figure [ fig2 ] , where @xmath134 is plotted against @xmath135 on a double logarithmic plot .",
    "after the initial transients , there is a good collapse of the data onto a scaling curve , in which an initial slope of zero gives way , at @xmath136 , to a final slope of @xmath137 , corresponding to the regimes @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively .",
    "we can interpret the asymptotic result @xmath140 as follows .",
    "if we coarse grain in the @xmath0-direction , the average deterministic drift is zero , and the nominally subdominant diffusive motion in the @xmath3-direction @xcite , with diffusion constant @xmath141 , plays an important role .",
    "the effective coarse - grained dynamics corresponds to anisotropic two - dimensional diffusion . if the absorbing boundary is the whole @xmath0-axis , diffusion in the @xmath0-direction is irrelevant ( except for its role in inducing diffusion in the @xmath3-direction ) and the standard one - dimensional result for the survival probability , eq .",
    "( [ 1d ] ) , is obtained .",
    "one can now discuss , however , other types of absorbing boundary .",
    "first we consider absorption on the half - line @xmath6 , @xmath18 .",
    "numerical simulations , presented in figure [ fig3 ] , suggest @xmath93 for this case , while for absorption on the two half lines @xmath6 , @xmath18 and @xmath45 , @xmath101 , which define an absorbing wedge of angle @xmath142 , the data suggest ( for @xmath100 initially ) @xmath143 .    these seemingly mysterious exponents are readily understood in the context of the underlying anisotropic two - dimensional diffusion process . for _ isotropic",
    "_ diffusion inside a wedge of opening angle @xmath144 , with absorbing boundaries on the edges of the wedge , the survival probability is known to decay as a power law , @xmath145 , with @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "the absorbing boundary on the half - line @xmath6 , @xmath18 corresponds to opening angle @xmath147 , giving @xmath93 , while the absorbing boundary on the two half - lines @xmath6 , @xmath18 and @xmath45 , @xmath101 corresponds to @xmath148 , giving @xmath149 .",
    "although the effective diffusion process is here anisotropic , it can be transformed into an isotropic process by rescaling the @xmath3 or @xmath0 variable .",
    "since this rescaling does not change the geometry of the two absorbing boundaries considered , the results @xmath24 and @xmath150 respectively are not changed .",
    "it is straightforward to apply the same general reasoning to the band model where the positive- and negative - flow bands are inequivalent .",
    "consider a model where bands of width @xmath41 and @xmath151 alternate with bands of width @xmath42 and @xmath152 .",
    "for the special cases where @xmath153 there will be no macroscopic flow , and a coarse - grained description will lead to an anisotropic diffusion model as before , with the same values of @xmath21 , e.g.  @xmath47 if the whole @xmath0-axis is absorbing ( indeed , @xmath47 will hold for any periodic @xmath7 with zero mean ) .",
    "if @xmath154 , the coarse - grained model has a mean flow away from the absorbing boundary , and the infinite - time survival probability is non - zero , while for @xmath155 the mean flow is towards the boundary and the survival probability decays exponentially with time . in the following subsection we provide an exact solution for the case @xmath156 , in the limit @xmath157 , @xmath158 , with @xmath159 held fixed .",
