    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics  @xcite has been working successfully to explain most phenomena observed in experiments .",
    "it reached its summit when the 125-gev higgs boson was discovered  @xcite and its properties were later on shown to be in good agreement with sm expectations .",
    "an on - going program in particle physics is to determine at high precision the higgs couplings with other sm particles , as such studies could reveal whether there is an extended higgs sector and give us more information about electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "if there is an extended higgs sector , many observables in flavor physics that are sensitive to new physics ( np ) can be affected .",
    "in general , models with physics beyond the sm can lead to higgs - mediated flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s )  @xcite , which have severe constraints from flavor physics .",
    "even though such fcnc s can be avoided by imposing certain conditions for natural flavor conservation  @xcite or yukawa alignment  @xcite , it is better to leave it to experimental data to tell us whether the fcnc couplings are indeed negligibly small or sufficiently sizeable to have some intriguing phenomenological effects .",
    "one channel that provides an excellent probe for the higgs - mediated fcnc couplings is the rare decay  @xcite .",
    "this decay has a relatively simple structure in the sm , involving only a single vector current operator in the effective interaction hamiltonian .",
    "recently the lhcb collaboration has measured a branching ratio @xmath9 for the decay  @xcite . combined with the previous cms measurement @xmath10  @xcite",
    ", one would obtain the average value @xmath11 this value is in general agreement with the value predicted in the sm  @xcite , which , using currently known inputs , is @xmath12 comparing the values above , one notices that the experimental central value is about @xmath13 lower than the sm one .",
    "np effects may address such a discrepancy , though the error bars are still too large to call for such a solution .",
    "nevertheless one can use eqs .",
    "( [ bsmm : avg ] ) and ( [ bsmm : sm ] ) to constrain possible np contributions and study their implications .",
    "if the 125-gev higgs boson @xmath14 has fcnc couplings to fermions , its mediation can produce scalar and/or pesudoscalar operators that contribute to the @xmath15 decay . in the sm ,",
    "such operators are generated only at loop level and further suppressed by the small muon yukawa coupling .",
    "however , such interactions may be generated at tree level and do not suffer from chiral suppression in physics beyond the sm .",
    "it is the primary purpose of this work to constrain such couplings using the recently measured @xmath15 decay along with others , and study the implications for other processes .",
    "another closely related and important constraint comes from the @xmath1 mass difference through the @xmath1-@xmath16 mixing effect .",
    "the updated sm prediction of @xmath2  @xcite and the most recent experimental measurement  @xcite are , respectively , @xmath17 they provide a tight constraint on tree - level higgs scalar and pseudoscalar couplings with the @xmath18 and @xmath19 quarks .    in the lepton sector",
    ", a hint of significant flavor - changing higgs couplings comes from recent measurements of @xmath20 obtained by the cms and atlas collaborations , respectively .",
    "the central values of such large branching ratios , if taken seriously , call for a sizeble @xmath21-@xmath22 flavor - violating higgs coupling .",
    "the existence of fcnc couplings of the higgs boson to fermions occur in many extensions of the sm in the higgs sector  @xcite , such as multi - higgs doublet models  @xcite .",
    "a simple example that can lead to tree level higgs fcnc couplings with fermions is by introducing certain dimension-6 operators  @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes some new physics scale , in addition to the usual dimension-4 yukawa interactions @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . here",

    "is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are in general non - diagonal and @xmath42  gev is the vacuum expectation value of the sm higgs field .",
    "hence , they can induce higgs - mediated fcnc processes at tree level .    in this work , we make use of the combined result of the branching ratio , the @xmath1 mass difference  ( [ massdiff : bs ] ) , and the @xmath43  @xcite and @xmath3  @xcite decay rates to constrain the involved higgs couplings . from the constrained parameter space ,",
    "we can make predictions for the @xmath44 and @xmath45 as well as the @xmath7 decays without invoking additional assumptions .",
    "generically elements in the yukawa matrices @xmath46 and @xmath47 are independent of each other . in order to increase the predictive power ,",
    "one often employs some texture for the yukawa couplings , such as the cheng - sher ansatz  @xcite , so that one can also compute the rates for more related processes .",
    "we will take the cheng - sher ansatz as a working assumption to put it to a test in the face of the coupling constraints extracted from the above - mentioned data .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : bsmumu ] , we discuss how the tree - level higgs - mediated fcnc interactions affect the @xmath48 decay , the @xmath1-@xmath16 mixing , and the @xmath3 and @xmath6 decays . in section  [ sec : predictions ] , we present a detailed numerical analysis to obtain the allowed parameter space for the fcnc couplings . in section  [ sec : h - tau - mu ] , we first study implications for the @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath6 decays without invoking any additional assumptions .",

    "with complex yukawa couplings , the contribution from the imaginary part will add to the sm predicted value and become closer to the experimental value . since there is a large uncertainty caused by long distance contribution for @xmath248  @xcite , it is possible that when adding all contributions together the correct value will be produced and the cheng - sher ansatz is valid here .",
    "the contributions to @xmath249 is also about 10% .",
    "therefore within the region allowed by the @xmath1-@xmath16 mixing , the @xmath250-@xmath251 is predicted to be consistent with the data . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath252 decay branching ratio will also be about the same order as that in the sm , which is smaller than the current experimental bound of @xmath253 at 95% cl  @xcite .",
    "one also predicts @xmath254 resulting in @xmath255 .",
    "this is much smaller than current experimental bound of @xmath256 .",
    "motivated by the recent precision determination of the decay branching ratio , we consider its constraints on tree - level flavor - changing yukawa couplings with the 125-gev higgs boson , as defined in eq .  .",
    "to gain more definite information , we also take into account the @xmath1 mass difference @xmath2 , the @xmath3 decay branching ratio determined by the cms collaboration , and the signal strength of the @xmath4 channel from the lhc run - i data .    in",
    "what follows , we summarize the constraints on flavor - changing couplings obtained in this work , assuming that they are generally complex . from @xmath149 alone ,",
    "we obtain @xmath257 from @xmath2 , we have @xmath258 combining with the constraints from the @xmath51 branching ratio measured by the cms collaboration and the @xmath43 signal strength from the lhc run - i data , we have made predictions for the branching ratios of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays . in particular , @xmath259 can be as large as @xmath260 at 95% cl",
    ". this may be quite challenging for the lhcb and future belle - ii experiments to measure .",
    "finally , we use the above - mentioned constraints obtained from data to test the cheng - sher ansatz .",
    "we have shown that if the branching ratio is found to deviate significantly from the sm expectation in the future , the combined analysis with the @xmath43 and @xmath193 data can give us a lower bound on the pseudoscalar yukawa coupling @xmath89 , provided that the @xmath1 mass difference is still dominated by the sm contribution .",
    "as an example , the parameter @xmath261 is found to fall within the @xmath206 regime when the scalar yukawa couplings are assumed to be sm - like .",
    "we have also made a brief comment on the possibility of observing cp violation in the @xmath8 decay .",
