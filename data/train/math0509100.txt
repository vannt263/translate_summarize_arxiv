    "an example of such a tiling is the _ regular cube tiling _ of @xmath0 by cubes of the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 .    in dimension",
    "@xmath17 , there is only one type of special cube tiling , while in dimension @xmath14 , two following types of special cube tilings exist :    the keller s cube tiling conjecture ( see @xcite ) asserts that any tiling of @xmath0 by translates of a unit cube admits at least one face - to - face adjacency .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that if this conjecture has a counter example , then there is another counter example , which is also a special cube tiling . using this ,",
    "the keller conjecture was solved negatively for @xmath18 in @xcite and @xmath19 in @xcite ( note that the conjecture is proved to be true for @xmath20 in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , special cube tilings , while seemingly limited objects have a lot of combinatorial possibilities . in the rest of this paper _ cube tiling",
    "_ stands for special cube tilings and @xmath8 is the number of orbits of cubes under the translation group @xmath2 .",
    "another equivalent viewpoint is to say that we are doing tilings of the torus @xmath21 and @xmath8 is then the number of cubes in this torus .",
    "a _ cube packing _ is a @xmath2-periodic set of integral translates of the @xmath22-cube , such that any two cubes are non - intersecting . in dimension",
    "@xmath23 , there exist cube packings , called _ non - extendible _ , which can not be extended to a tiling of the space ( this first appear in @xcite ) . in dimension @xmath4 this non - extendible packing is unique ( see figure [ uniqueinex ] ) and it is the source of much of the inspiration of this paper .    in section [ algorithms ] , following @xcite , we present a translation of the packing and tiling problems into clique problems in graphs .",
    "explicit methods , in gap , are used up to @xmath24 . for @xmath25",
    ", we use various random methods , in fortran 90 and c++ for generating random cube packings .",
    "denote by @xmath26 the smallest number of cubes , which form a non - extendible cube packing . in section [ non - extendiblecubepackings ] , we give some lower and upper bounds on the value of @xmath26 . in @xcite it is proved that any cube packing of @xmath27 by cubes @xmath1 is extendible to a @xmath2-periodic cube tiling of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath28 is a cube packing , denote by @xmath29 and call _ hole _ , its complement @xmath30 .",
    "we prove that if a cube packing has more than @xmath7 cubes , then it is extendible to a tiling , i.e. that holes of volume at most @xmath4 are fillable .",
    "we also obtain some conjecture on nonfillable holes of volume at most @xmath31 .    given a cube packing @xmath28 , the _ counting function _",
    "@xmath32 is defined as the number of cubes of @xmath28 contained in @xmath12 .",
    "we study its second moment in section [ secondmoment ] .",
    "we prove , that the highest second moment for tilings is attained for the regular cube tiling and give a lower bound for the second moment of cube packings , in terms of its dimension @xmath6 and number of cubes @xmath8 .",
    "every @xmath14-cube of a @xmath6-dimensional cube packing is equivalent under @xmath2 to a cube with center in @xmath33 .",
    "two @xmath14-cubes of centers @xmath34 and @xmath35 do not overlap if and only if there exist a coordinate @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 .",
    "so , one consider the graphs @xmath38 ( introduced in @xcite ) with vertex - set @xmath33 and two vertices being adjacent if and only if their associated cubes do not overlap . cube packings correspond to cliques of @xmath38 ; they are non - extendible if and only if the cliques are not included in larger cliques .",
    "cube tilings correspond to cliques of size @xmath39 .    for a given @xmath6 , the graph @xmath38 has a finite number of vertices and a symmetry group @xmath40 of size @xmath41 .",
    "hence , it is theoretically possible to do the enumeration of the cliques of @xmath38 .",
    "the algorithm consists of using the set of all cliques with @xmath8 vertices , considering all possibilities of extension , and then reducing by isomorphism using @xmath40 ( the actual computation was done in gap , see @xcite ) .",
    "the group @xmath40 is presented as a permutation group in gap and the cliques as subsets of @xmath42 .",
    "gap uses backtrack search for testing if two subsets are equivalent under @xmath40 and is hence , very efficient even for large values of @xmath6 .",
    "this enumeration is , in practice , possible only for @xmath3 due to the huge number of cliques that appear .    for @xmath43",
    ", one finds only two non - extendible cliques of @xmath5 vertices , i.e. two cube tilings . for @xmath44 , there is a unique non - extendible clique with @xmath5 vertices , while there are @xmath45 orbits of non - extendible cliques with @xmath46 vertices ( i.e. cube tilings ) . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the computations are still possible and one finds the following results with @xmath8 being the number of vertices of the clique .",
    "@xmath47 suppose that we have a cube tiling with two cube centers @xmath34 and @xmath35 , satisfying to @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the @xmath36-th unit vector , i.e. they have a face - to - face adjacency .",
    "if one replace @xmath34 , @xmath35 by @xmath50 , @xmath51 and leave other centers unchanged , then one obtains another cube tiling , which we call the _ flip _ of the original cube tiling .",
    "the enumeration strategy is then the following : take as initial list of orbits the orbit of the regular cube tiling . for every orbit of cube packing , compute all possible pairs @xmath52 , which allow to create a new cube tiling .",
    "if the corresponding orbits of cube tilings are new , then we insert them into the list of orbits . given a dimension @xmath6 , consider the graph @xmath53 , whose vertex - set consists of all orbits of cube tilings and put an edge between two orbits if one is obtained from the other by a flipping . the above algorithm",
    "consists of computing the connected component of the regular cube tiling in @xmath53 . since the keller conjecture is false in dimension @xmath19 , we know that in those dimensions there are some isolated vertices in the graph and so , the above algorithm does not work .",
    "however , the graph @xmath53 is connected for @xmath3 , i.e. any two cube tilings in those dimensions can be obtained by a sequence of flipping .",
    "it is an interesting question to decide , in which dimension @xmath6 the graph @xmath53 is connected ; the only remaining unsolved cases are @xmath54 .    for dimensions @xmath25 , two above enumerative methods can not work since there are too much possibilities . hence , we used random methods .",
    "_ consist of selecting points , at random , on @xmath33 , so that the corresponding @xmath14-cubes do not intersect , until one can not do this any more .",
    "this random packing algorithm creates non - extendible cube packings .",
    "the actual algorithm for creating non - extendible cube packings is as follows : the list @xmath55 of selected cubes is , initially , empty .",
    "one select at random elements of @xmath33 and keep them if they are adjacent to preceding elements of @xmath55 . of course not every trial works and as the space becomes more and more filled , the number of random generation needed to get a non - overlapping cube increase . when this number has reached a certain level , we go to a second stage : enumerate all possible extensions of the clique , that we have , and work in this list by eliminating elements of it after choices are made .",
    "this algorithm has the advantage of enumerating the set @xmath33 only one time and is hence , relatively fast .",
    "if one wants to find some packings with low density , then the above strategy is not necessarily the best .",
    "the _ greedy algorithm _ consists of keeping all @xmath56 elements in memory and at every step generate , say @xmath57 elements and keep the one which cover the largest part of the remaining space .",
    "another possibility is what we call _ metropolis algorithm _",
    "( see @xcite ) : we take an non - extendible cube packing , remove a few cubes and rerun a random generation from the remaining cubes .",
    "if obtained packing is better than the preceding one , or not worse than a specified upper bound , then we keep it ; otherwise , we rerun the algorithm .",
    "this strategy allows to make a random walk in the space of non - extendible cube packings and is based on the assumption , that the best non - extendible cube packings are not far from other , less good , non - extendible cube packings .",
    "in dimension @xmath17 or @xmath14 , any cube packing is extendible to a cube tiling .",
    "the exhaustive enumeration methods of the preceding section show that in dimension @xmath4 , there is a unique non - extendible cube packing .",
    "the set of its centers is , up to a symmetry of @xmath58 : @xmath59 and its corresponding drawing is shown on figure [ uniqueinex ] .",
    "its space group symmetry is p4(1)32 , which is a chiral group .",
    "we first concentrate on the problem of finding non - extendible cube packings with the smallest number @xmath26 of cubes . from section [ algorithms ] , we know that @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    [ multiplicativeineq ] for any @xmath64 , one has the inequality @xmath65 .",
