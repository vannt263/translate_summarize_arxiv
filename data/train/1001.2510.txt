    "a new solar problem has emerged recently .",
    "the determinations of the photospheric heavy element abundances @xcite indicate that the sun metallicity is lower than previously assumed @xcite .",
    "solar models that incorporate these lower abundances are no more able to reproduce the helioseismic results .",
    "detailed studies have been done to resolve this controversy ( see @xcite for a review ) , but the origin of the `` solar composition problem '' has still to be identified .    in this situation",
    ", it is useful to perform a detailed analysis of the role of physical inputs and of the standard assumptions for standard solar model ( ssm ) calculations .",
    "this task is not always possible in simple terms , since the construction of ssm relys on ( time - consuming ) numerical integration of a non linear system of partial differential equations . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", we provide a tool which is at same time simple and accurate enough to describe the effects of a generic ( small ) modification of the physical inputs on the solar properties .",
    "the starting point is the idea that , despite the present disagreement with helioseismic data , the ssm is a rather good approximation of the real sun .",
    "we can thus assume small variations of the physical and chemical properties of the sun with respect to the ssm predictions and use a linear theory to relate them to the properties of the solar plasma .",
    "we consider the effects of a generic ( small ) modification of the input parameters of the sun .",

    ", we obtain a solar model which deviates from ssm .",
