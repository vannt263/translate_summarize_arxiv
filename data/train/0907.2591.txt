    "bistability and oscillations are ubiquitous in natural systems , and occur on a variety of scales from the micro ( e.g. microfluidics ) to the macro ( e.g. magma flow ) .",
    "while the physics often differs , the necessary ingredients are a source of nonlinearity and a feedback mechanism .",
    "for example , the flow of droplets through microfluidic networks demonstrates bistability and oscillations , even when the network boundary conditions are fixed @xcite .",
    "the source of nonlinearity and feedback in this case is the hydrodynamic resistance due to the presence of droplets in various parts of the network @xcite . on the macro - scale , bistability and oscillations",

    "bistability and oscillations in fluid networks are also key ingredients for fluidic logic devices . in the last ten years",
    ", multiple researchers have demonstrated that microfluidic memory , logic , and control devices can be constructed using a single - phase fluid with elastic properties @xcite or using droplets or bubbles which form spontaneously when two immiscible fluids merge @xcite .",
    "these recent studies are reminiscent of classic fluidic circuits which were quite common in the 1960s @xcite . in classic fluidics",
    "the nonlinearity needed to build devices such as logic gates and flip - flops comes from inertial flow effects , which is not present in microfluidic systems .",
    "another important fluid network which may exhibit similar behavior is the microvascular network .",
    "modeling and simulation of microvascular bloodflow involves a number of non - linear rheological effects that are absent in larger vessels ( see @xcite for a good review ) .",
    "the fahraeus - lindqvist effect refers to the viscosity of blood as a function of both hematocrit ( red blood cell volume concentration ) and vessel diameter .",
    "the apparent reduction in viscosity as diameter decreases is usually attributed to the existence of a lubricating layer of plasma along the edge of the vessel .",
    "this lubricating layer is also responsible for the plasma skimming effect which describes the flow - dependent separation of blood at diverging bifurcations .    over the last ten years",
    ", we ( jbg and rtc ) have focused our attention on analyzing the flow of blood through small networks of microvessels .",
    "we have demonstrated that , in a simple network consisting of a single inlet , a loop , and a single outlet multiple equilibria could exist and that steady state solutions could become unstable via a hopf bifurcation to a limit cycle oscillation @xcite .",
    "we recently turned our attention to the three - node network ( figure [ fig : network ] ) which consists of two inlets , a loop , and one outlet .",
    "the flow in vessel c can be clockwise or counter - clockwise depending on the equilibrium state . using models of the fahraeus - lindqvist effect and the plasma skimming effect appropriate for _ in vivo _",
    "bloodflow @xcite , we have demonstrated that realistic network geometries exist which can support flow in either direction in vessel c , i.e. bistability @xcite .",
    "in this paper we explore bistability in a system where essentially all the complexities which exist in many of the above studies have been removed .",
    "we consider the low reynolds number laminar flow of two ordinary miscible newtonian fluids of different viscosity in the simple network shown in figure [ fig : network ] .",
    "remarkably , we find theoretically and experimentally that bistability can exist in this system which , at first glance , seems linear . however , when ordinary fluids mix , the viscosity of the resulting mixture depends ( nonlinearly ) on the relative volume fraction of each fluid and this nonlinearity is sufficient to introduce bistability in the network flow . after reviewing the model and the theoretical predictions we discuss the experimental set - up and present results which confirm our analysis .",
    "we end with a discussion of the implications of these results .",
    "we explore flow in the simple three - node network shown in figure [ fig : network ] .",
    "two miscible fluids of different viscosities are injected in inlet 1 and 2 at either fixed pressure or flow .",
    "the outlet is held at a fixed pressure .",
    "the network model assumes laminar , fully developed flow in each of the branches with well - mixed fluid after junctions where the two fluids meet .",
    "similar results can be obtained even if the fluids do not mix after junctions , and we consider that case later in the paper . without loss of generality , we assume that the more viscous fluid always occupies inlet 2 .",
    "we assume that the fluid obeys poiseuille s law such that the pressure drop @xmath0 is proportional to the volumetric flow @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hydraulic resistance , @xmath4 is the diameter of the tube , @xmath5 is the length of the tube , and @xmath6 is the fluid viscosity . for convenience we will refer to the nominal resistance as the part of the tube resistance which is only dependent on the geometry and not the fluid , i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "the total pressure drop around the loop must be zero , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are positive with the flow toward the exit .",
    "while the direction of the flow in branch c may be in either direction , we define @xmath11 to be positive when the flow is counter - clockwise , i.e. from inlet 1 to inlet 2 . since the liquid is incompressible the total flow rate into any junction",
    "must also equal the flow rate out , namely @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "when the fluids mix at a node , their volumes are additive such that we can compute the volume fraction of fluid 2 , @xmath14 , in the resulting mixture .",

    "the point where the flow in branch c goes to zero is simply @xmath25 . for a symmetric network where the nominal resistance in a and b are equal , the flow in branch c goes to zero when @xmath26",

    "there is a unique value of @xmath17 for a given pressure ratio , but its value depends upon the viscosity contrast . when @xmath32 the flow is still into the network through branches 1 and 2",

    "the width of this region of bistability widens as the viscosity ratio increases .",

    "the point where the flow must always be going out of the network at branch 1 occurs at @xmath34 .",
    "it is interesting to note that at sufficiently high viscosity ratios , there may exist 5 equilibrium flow conditions for a given pressure ratio , 3 of which are stable and 2 of which are unstable .",
    "it was surprising to us to find such rich behavior in a simple network under laminar flow with newtonian fluids .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we concentrate on the bistability region about the point @xmath35 .",
    "in order to test our prediction of bistability , we built a simple and inexpensive experimental flow network .",
    "the flow network was constructed with common 1/16 inch inner diameter clear plastic tubing .",
    "the connections in the network are made with barbed t fittings . in order to have well - mixed flow in the tubes , we place static inline flow mixers right after the t - junctions in branches a and b. without the mixers , the two fluids remain stratified ( they were not density matched ) which changes the switching points but does not destroy the hysteresis .",
    "inlet tubes 1 and 2 are connected to a pressure source , which is simply a large graduated cylinder filled to a set level .",
    "the graduated cylinders act as our flow reservoirs and the pressure of the reservoirs are known from hydrostatics . the reservoir levels change slowly as the network drains , but this draining can be offset by slowly pumping new fluid into the reservoirs .",
    "inlet 1 always contains pure water while inlet 2 consists of an aqueous sucrose solution of varying concentration .",
    "food coloring is added so that we can observe the direction of flow in branch c as well as confirm mixing .",
    "the relative lengths of the tubes were @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and we chose @xmath39 m for convenience .",
    "the mixers were tested experimentally and their equivalent resistance was approximately that of @xmath40 m of additional tubing . before each experiment , we measured the viscosity and density of the sucrose mixture in reservoir 2 to confirm that it matches known data @xcite .",
    "\\a )   b )     to observe bistability , the level of the sucrose solution in reservoir 2 is maintained at a constant level .",
    "the level of the water in reservoir 1 is initially high so that the fluid in branch c is water , @xmath41 and flowing from 1 to 2 .",
    "the level of the water in reservoir 1 is allowed to drop slowly as the network drains the reservoir , thus decreasing the pressure at inlet 1 .",
    "the rate at which the level of reservoir 1 falls is slow compared to the time for the network to come to equilibrium . at some point",
    "we visually observe the flow in c to become negative and start flowing from 2 to 1 .",
    "we record the water level in reservoir 1 at this point .",
    "the level of reservoir 1 is then raised by slowly pumping water in such that the bistable region can be confirmed .",
    "we find the flow in c remains negative for a sufficiently long time . as the level of reservoir 1 rises , the flow eventually switches direction back to @xmath41 , and we record the water level in reservoir 1 when this occurs .",
    "an example of the experimental path is shown in figure [ fig : bistable_exp]a ; our experiment records the two switching points .",
    "thus , in this work we concentrate only on the bistability region around the point @xmath42 .",
    "we repeat the above experiment for a number of initial sucrose concentrations ( viscosities ) in reservoir 2 .",
    "a comparison of the experimental data compared to the model prediction is shown in figure [ fig : bistable_exp]b .",
    "we see good agreement between the model and experiment . for small sucrose concentrations",
    "there is no bistable window .",
    "as the sucrose concentration ( viscosity ) exceeds a critical value a bistable window opens up and widens as the sucrose concentration is further increased .",
    "the threshold sucrose concentration depends on the specific geometry of the network and is approximately 30% mass fraction for our network , corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "the existence of bistability depends on the network geometry and the viscosity of the inlet fluids .",
    "it is possible to analytically determine whether a given network and fluid combination can exhibit bistable behavior .",
    "the point where the flow in c goes to zero is determined from eq .",
    "[ eq : qc ] , @xmath44 . if the slope of the equilibrium flow - pressure curve switches direction at this point then a bistable window will exist ( see figure [ fig : bistable_exp]a ) .",
    "the analysis ( details can be found in the appendix ) yields a simple criteria for the existence of bistability , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass density of fluid @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the molar mass of fluid @xmath47 .",
    "the parameters on the left hand side depend only upon the fluids , while the parameters on the right hand side depend only upon the network geometry .",
    "if we apply this criteria to our experimental network , we find that @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding minimum mass fraction of sucrose to water in inlet 2 required to observe bistability in this particular network is 29 % which agrees well with our experimental data .",
    "in addition , eq . [ eq : existence ] gives a lower bound on the viscosity contrast required to observe bistability in any network obtained by making the left - hand side positive and using the corresponding experimental values for the fluids .",
    "for a water - sucrose solution this value is approximately 2.3 .",
    "thus far we have presented the prediction of bistability under the special condition that the fluids are well mixed after any junction .",
    "we presented this case first as it is the most straightforward , simplest , and surprising manifestation of a more general behavior .",
    "the analysis which led to eq .",
    "[ eq : existence ] can be generalized for any effective resistance of the tube after two fluids merge .",
    "the more general criterion for bistability is ( see appendix ) , @xmath50 where the viscosity of the mixture @xmath6 is expressed in terms of the volume fraction @xmath14 .",
    "there is nothing in this expression that is unique to an arrenhius mixture law for the system to exhibit bistability . since the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : existence_general ] must always be positive , then bistability is possible in general as long as @xmath51 .",
    "this result does reveal that bistability is not possible for a mixture with viscosity linearly dependent on volume fraction , e.g. weak suspensions .",
    "the most practical extension of our experiment is to remove the mixers from the system .",
    "the mixers were introduced only to create a model experimental system to confirm the simple theory . if the fluid mixers are removed from the junctions we observed that the flow is stratified due to the large density difference between the two fluids .",
    "such a stratified , unmixed flow would be more representative of laminar , low reynolds number flows , resulting from bringing two streams together , especially in microfluidic applications .",
    "the fully mixed case might only be expected in practice if the diameters were extremely small and branches sufficiently long such that molecular diffusion can mix the streams . however , on the scale of many microfluidic networks diffusion times are often relatively slow .    to make predictions about stratified flow",
    ", we need to know the effective mixture viscosity to replace the arrenhius law of eq .",
    "[ eq : visc ] . in the stratified flow case , the effective viscosity is no longer a property of the fluid mixture , but becomes a property of the flow .",
    "we therefore must solve for the velocity field in the tube to calculate the overall hydraulic resistance .",

    "fluid 1 and fluid 2 occupy the regions above and below this interface .",
    "we assume the flow is steady and fully developed in the axial direction , @xmath52 , and solve for the navier - stokes equations for the axial velocity field , @xmath53 , across the tube s cross section for a unit pressure drop .",
    "the full navier - stokes equations become quite simplified in the steady , fully developed case ; @xmath54 the vector operators above are two dimensional and only apply over a cross section of tubing",
    ". numerically , we can easily solve eq .",
    "[ eq : strat ] using a commercial finite element package , comsol multiphysics . after solving eq .",
    "[ eq : strat ] , the flow rates of the two fluids , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are determined from integration of the velocity field . the overall hydraulic resistance , and thus the effective viscosity , is @xmath57 .",
    "we then move the location of the horizontal interface between the two fluids from the bottom of the tube to the top which allows us to calculate the resistance as a function of the volume fraction as shown by the blue dashed curve in figure [ fig : bistable_exp_strat]a .",
    "this simple calculation reproduces the resistance law calculated by gemmel and epstein in 1962 @xcite .",

    "it is interesting to note that in the case of miscible fluids this model is relatively sensitive to even small amounts of molecular diffusion . as an example",
