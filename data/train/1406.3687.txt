    "url shortening is a technique of mapping a long uniform resource locator ( url ) to a short url redirecting to the same landing page .",
    "initially , the concept was used to prevent breaking of complex urls while copying text , to accommodate long urls without line breaks , and for smooth dissemination of content .",
    "usage of these services nowadays has become a trend in online social media ( osm ) ; content length restriction imposed by various osms ( e.g. twitter s 140 character limit ) has helped popularize their use even further . in order to accommodate more content in their tweet , users prefer to compress their long urls using url shortening services .",
    "some popular url shortening services like _ bit.ly _ and _ goo.gl _ track urls and provide real time click traffic analysis @xcite .",
    "although these services are created to comfort the users , spammers have found their ways to target and misuse the facility for their benefit .",
    "url shorteners do not only reduce the url length but also obfuscate the actual url behind a shortened link .",
    "spammers take advantage of this obfuscation to misguide the netizens by posting malicious links on osm .",
    "these malicious links can be : i ) _ spam _ - irrelevant messages sent to large number of people online , ii ) _ scam _ - online fraud to mislead people , iii ) _ phishing _ - online fraud to get user credentials , or iv ) _ malware _ - auto downloadable content to damage the system .",
    "link obfuscation makes short url spam more difficult to detect than traditional long url spam .",
    "malicious long urls can be detected with a direct domain lookup or a simple blacklist check , while short urls can easily escape such technique .",
    "lexical methods to detect long url spam work slow for short urls because of additional redirects .",
    "malicious short url detection therefore requires more efficient spam detection techniques . according to a threat activity report by symantec in year 2010 @xcite , around 65% malicious urls on osm",
    "were shortened urls .",
    "another study in 2012 investigated a particular url shortening service ( _ qr.cx _ ) and revealed that around 80% of shortened urls from this service contained spam - related content @xcite .",
    "research by a url shortener _ yi.tl _ reveals that because of deep penetration of spam , 614 out of 1,002 url shortening services became non - functional in year 2012 .",
    "a recent article highlights that facebook spammers make close to 200 million dollar through posting these shortened links to lure users @xcite .",
    "bitly , launched in year 2008 is one of the most popular url shortening services on the web @xcite .",
    "it gained major traction when twitter started to use it as a default url shortener in year 2009 before the launch of its own service , _",
    "t.co _ in the year 2011 .",
    "bitly provides an interface to its users to either shorten a link anonymously or create an account to shorten the links .",
    "each link shortened by a user has a unique _ global hash _ ( an aggregated identifier corresponding to a link ) .",
    "such shortened links , known as _ bitmarks _ can then be saved , tracked , and shared .",
    "users are also allowed to connect any number of facebook / twitter accounts with their bitly accounts , making the task of shortening and sharing a link very convenient . with 1 billion new links shortened on bitly",
    "each day and 6 billion clicks each month , spammers have been exploiting the service to a great extent @xcite . in early 2013 ,",
    "a news article reported the spread of phishing attacks on twitter through direct messages ( dm ) with malicious bitly links .",
    "large number of users fell in the trap and clicked on the link , which redirected to a website that replicated twitter s login page .",
    "victims were then misled to believe that their session was expired and were made to login again , unknowingly revealing their twitter credentials to the attacker .",
    "impact of the attack was such that twitter announced a temporary restriction on sending shortened links including bitly in dms .     in another attack , spammers abused the redirect vulnerabilities of a popular legitimate domain belonging to the u.s .",
    "federal government , which had collaboration with bitly . the hijacked domain",
    "_ 1.usa.gov _ which redirected to an illegitimate _ work - from - home _ scam website received around 43,049 clicks from 124 countries within a week .",
    "this shows that even _ branded short domains _ by bitly are not safe from exploits @xcite . in october 2013",
    ", bitly also experienced a massive ddos attack rendering complete shutdown of its services for close to 7 hours .",
    "some spammers have started to build their own url shortening services to double - shorten the malicious links , first with a self created short url service , then with a legitimate short url service to evade security checks .",
    "security researchers from symantec found that spammers used bitly urls to propagate sexually suggestive content @xcite . unlike other url shortening services like _ goo.gl _ and _ ow.ly_ , bitly does not provide a captcha to test human identity at the time of url shortening . for protection against spam ,",
    "bitly claims to use real - time spam detection services like google safebrowsing and surbl , and flags 2 - 3 millions links as spam each week @xcite .",
    "bitly neither deletes a flagged suspicious link nor suspends the associated user ; but displays a warning page whenever such a link is clicked .",
    "such a warning page is by - passable and does not completely restrict a user to visit the malicious website .",
    "also , non - deletion of illegitimate content or account can make it viral over web . despite of all these detection measures adopted by bitly ,",
    "there is continued existence of malicious bitly urls .",
    "it is therefore important to have an in depth understanding of the gaps in bitly s spam detection techniques that deter its efficiency to handle malicious content .",
    "this paper deals with the identification of such gaps and highlights some countermeasures which can be adopted by bitly to be able to detect malicious content more effectively . in this work",
    ", we perform a detailed analysis on a dataset of suspicious bitly links and their associated attributes to characterize bitly spam and explore its spam detection policies .",
    "major contributions of this paper are :    * _ impact analysis of malicious bitly links on osm _ : there exist large communities propagating malicious content through bitly on twitter",
    ". such communities can grow in size if bitly does not impose any limit on the number of connected osm accounts . * _ identification of issues in bitly s spam detection _ : we found that bitly is unable to detect malicious links tracked by popular blacklist services and is not using its claimed spam detection techniques very effectively .",
    "spammers exploit bitly s _ no account suspension _ policy and keep shortening malicious urls . * _ machine learning classification to detect malicious bitly urls _ :",
    "our classification mechanism relies on the combination of long and short url based features and we attained an accuracy of 86.41% .",
    "our technique can work efficiently irrespective of the number of clicks received by a bitly url .    to the best our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first large scale study to highlight the issues with bitly s spam detection policies and propose a suitable solution .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 presents the related work and section 3 explains our data collection methodology .",
    "analysis and results are covered in section 4 and 5 .",
    "section 6 contains the conclusive summary and section 7 presents some future directions and limitations of our research .",
    "url shortening services take as input a long url ( e.g.  _ http://blog.bitly.com/post/138381844/spam-and-malware-protection_ ) and generates a short url ( e.g.  _",
    "bit.ly/rswvgo_ ) in return .",
    "short url so generated redirects to the same long url but looks random and unrelated to the actual link . imposed character limit has lead to immense popularity of such services in social media landscape . due to their ubiquitous usage",
    ", these services have been hit by adversaries to obfuscate and disseminate malicious content .",
    "this section presents the work done in understanding the usage pattern , behavior , and misuse of short urls .",
    "a number of studies have been conducted to understand the propagation of spam on osm , many of which revealed heavy usage of urls to spread malicious content .",
    "benevenuto et al . in their research identified distinctive features to detect spammers on twitter @xcite .",
    "researchers also evaluated the effectiveness of popular blacklists in evading spam and observed it to be inefficient .",
    "on twitter , checking blacklists becomes even slower because of the url shortening services used to obfuscate long urls .",
    "using these services , a spammer can complicate the process of detection by using chains of multiple shortenings  @xcite .",
    "thomas et al . in 2011",
    "developed a system called monarch which classifies a url submitted to any web service as malicious or benign in real time @xcite .",
    "this system relies on the features of url landing page ( like page content , hosting infrastructure , etc . ) and detected malicious links with an accuracy close to 91% . in year 2012 , aggarwal et al .",
    "also proposed a real time phishing detection system for twitter , called phishari @xcite .",
    "authors coupled the twitter and url based features to classify phishing tweets and achieved an accuracy of 92.52% . in another real time suspicious url detection technique on twitter proposed by lee et al .",
    ", authors addressed the problem of conditional url redirects @xcite . a combined feature set of _ correlated url redirects _ and _",
    "tweet context information _ was used and authors attained an accuracy of 86.3% .      with the introduction of short urls in osm , a comparative study is necessary to be able to understand the level of acceptance of short urls over long urls .",
    "kandylas et al .",
    "performed a comparative study of long and short bitly urls propagation on twitter and found that bitly links received orders of magnitude more clicks than an equal random set of long urls @xcite . to further comprehend short url distinctive characteristics , antoniades et al . studied the lifetime of short urls which revealed that the life span of 50% short urls exceeds 100 days",
    "other than this generic analysis , neumann et al .",
    "looked at malicious short urls in emails and highlighted their privacy and security implications @xcite .",
    "chhabra et al",
    ". also gave an overview of evolving phishing attacks through short urls on twitter and found that phishers use url shorteners not only to gain space but hide their malicious links @xcite .",
    "their results show that most of the tweets containing phishing urls comes from inorganic ( automated ) accounts .",
    "later in year 2012 , klien et al . presented the global usage pattern of short urls by setting up their own url shortening service and found 80% short url content to be spam related @xcite . in year 2013 , maggi et al . performed a large scale study on 25 million short urls belonging to 622 distinct url shortening services @xcite .",
    "their results highlight that the countermeasures adopted by these services to detect spam are not very effective and can be easily by - passed .",
    "experimental results from their data shows that bitly allows users to shorten malicious links and does not include any initial level lightweight check to prevent it ( though detects it after some time ) . unlike their study which focused on multiple url shorteners ,",
    "our research is an in depth analysis of the effectiveness of a single url shortener .",
    "another scheme was proposed by yoon et al . in year 2013 about using relative words of target urls in short urls @xcite .",
    "this can give hints to user to guess the target url , making it comparatively safe from phishing attacks .",
    "there is little research done in the area of malicious short url characterization .",
    "one such work that presents short url based features to detect malicious accounts is given by wang et al . in year 2013 @xcite . in their experiment , they investigated the creators of 600,000 short bitly urls and associated click traffic from different countries and referrers .",
    "based on the analysis , they classify a link as spam / non - spam using only 3 click traffic based features with maximum accuracy of 90.81% , but ignored all short urls with zero clicks .",
    "our study on the other hand incorporates all urls irrespective of their click state .",
    "in addition , their results reveal that legitimate bitly users also generate spam and most clicks on short malicious urls comes from popular websites .    after reviewing the above literature , it is evident that a lot of work has been done in the identification and analysis of malicious urls .",
    "surprisingly , very little work has been done in analyzing only suspicious short urls to expose the gaps in security mechanisms adopted by a specific url shortener .",
    "our work significantly differs from the prior studies , as we focus on understanding in depth , the loopholes in spam detection mechanisms of a url shortening service .",
    "we also propose and evaluate a semi supervised classification framework for spam detection in url shorteners .",
    "for our experimental dataset , we followed a two - phase approach . in the first phase , we acquired a dataset of suspicious bitly urls from bitly and collected their associated attributes to explore the issues with bitly s spam detection techniques . in the second phase , we collected a dataset of bitly urls from twitter and used machine learning algorithms to classify an unknown bitly url as malicious or benign .",
    "we call a bitly url as benign if it is non - malicious and trustworthy .",
    "to analyze the basic characteristics of short url spam , we requested bitly to share with us the links that they mark as suspicious .",
    "we received a dataset of 763,160 suspicious bitly urls which displayed a bitly warning page in the month of october 2013 .",
    "this dataset comprised of the global hash , associated long url , and number of warning pages displayed for the global hash .",
    "we call this the _ link - dataset_. bitly also provides a public api   to extract the link and user metrics for a particular short url . using the _ link - dataset _ as our seed input to bitly api , we collected analytics for 144,851 ( 18.98% ) links between january 2014 to march 2014 ( our data collection is still on ) .",
    "table  [ bitlyanalytics ] presents information about these analytics .",
    "we call this the _ link - metric - dataset_.    .[bitlyanalytics ] data we obtained for the suspicious bitly links . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     on a mix dataset",
    "of clicked and non - clicked links , _ type of referring domains _ is found to be the most discriminating feature .",
    "malicious bitly links usually have more direct referrers , i.e. such links are propagated more through email clients , mobile applications , sms , etc .",
    "such sources are often targeted by spammers because they have a direct impact on the user , which increases the chances for a malicious link to be seen and visited .",
    "_ difference between link and domain creation _ is another important feature based on information gain .",
    "as seen in section  [ domain analysis ] , offenders buy cheap domains for the deliberate purpose of spamming .",
    "such domains are mostly registered for a short time span with the objective to fully exploit them before they expire . the third most informative feature _ domain age _",
    "highlights the same .",
    "another strategy adopted by spammers is to shorten links at odd hours of the day , as depicted by the fourth most informative feature _ link creation hour_. _ type of encoders _ , _ link creation - click lag _ , and _ number of encoders _ are found to be comparatively less informative and did not help much in the classification . for our non -",
    "click dataset , _ link creation hour _ is observed to be the most important feature .",
    "remaining features follow the same ranking pattern as in the complete dataset",
    ".    l|l|c|c|c & malicious&benign + & malicious & @xmath0 & @xmath1 + & benign & @xmath2 & @xmath3 +    l|l|c|c|c & malicious&benign + & malicious & @xmath4 & @xmath5 + & benign & @xmath6 & @xmath7 +    l|l|c|c|c & malicious&benign + & malicious & @xmath8 & @xmath9 + & benign & @xmath10 & @xmath11 +",
    "our initial analysis gave an overview of some characteristics of malicious bitly links and their propagation on osm .",
    "spammers buy cheap domains for a dedicated purpose of spamming , which eventually die out after targeting a significant number of victims .",
    "we found that spammers exploit bitly s policy of not imposing a cap on the number of connected facebook / twitter accounts .",
    "we traced such spammers and detected 3 malicious communities which operate across bitly and twitter .",
    "we then unveiled some loopholes in bitly s security policies .",
    "bitly could not effectively detect malicious urls already tracked by the popular blacklist services like apwg and virustotal . leaving this aside",
    ", we also observed a lack of effectiveness in using the claimed detection services ( like surbl ) by bitly .",
    "malicious users are found to abuse bitly s _ no account suspension _ policy .",
    "about sixteen percent malicious users in our dataset shortened only suspicious links in their history without being noticed .",
    "bitly asserts that it forbids such users from shortening more links , but we identified users who kept shortening malicious links for close to 2 years and their state of detection is still unknown .",
    "we also highlighted how a by - passable bitly warning page is only partially effective to curtail the problem of spam .    at last , we proposed a mechanism to detect malicious links on bitly .",
    "we identified features from bitly and coupled them with some domain specific features to classify a bitly url as malicious or benign .",
    "computation of these features required close to 50 seconds per bitly url .",
    "our classifier predicted malicious links with the best accuracy of 80.40% on a mix dataset of clicked and non - clicked links . by eliminating _",
    "click _ based features , our classifier attained an improved accuracy of 83.51% on the mix dataset , and 86.41% on the _ non - click _ dataset .",
    "thus , our algorithm is not only efficient in detecting malicious bitly links when they receive clicks , but can also identify them much before they target the netizens .",
    "this shows that in addition to the blacklists and other spam detection filters , bitly specific feature set can also be used to detect malicious content .",
    "even though our dataset is unique , it is a limited dataset acquired from bitly .",
    "this dataset captured only links detected malicious by bitly in the month of october 2013 .",
    "since the characteristics of spammers evolve over time , we would like to do a detailed comparative analysis on more exhaustive dataset .",
    "bitly claims to forbid certain suspicious accounts but does not give this information through its api .",
    "this created a trouble in interpreting if a dormant suspicious account in our dataset has been blocked by bitly or not shortening the links itself . for malicious bitly link detection ,",
    "our classifier currently works better on _ non - click _ dataset .",
    "this is because we used only 2 _ click _ based features in our classification and links with zero clicks did not have click information . in future",
    ", we would like to do a temporal study of how click patterns on a malicious bitly url evolve over time , which can serve as another good feature for our classifier .",
    "our feature set can be broadened and generalized to detect spam from any short url services .",
    "in addition , we would like to develop a browser extension that can work in real time and classify any short link as malicious or benign .",
    "such a service can be very useful in short url spam detection across multiple online media .",
    "we thank all the members of precog research group at iiit - delhi for their valuable feedback and support throughout this work .",
    "we would also like to express our sincere gratitude to bitly and particularly brian david eoff ( senior data scientist ) and mark josephson ( ceo ) for sharing the data with us .",
