    "evolutionary dynamics describes biological systems subject to darwinian evolution by taking into account the main mechanisms and phenomena of evolution itself . in @xcite , maynard smith and price",
    "propose a first instance of this approach by considering a population modified according to the replicator dynamics .",
    "a population is formed by @xmath0 _ types _ , or _ behaviors _ , @xmath1 , with fractions corresponding to relative abundance in the vector @xmath2 , which corresponds to a point in the simplex @xmath3 the selection and adaptation mechanism is described by means of a system of differential equations in the following form : @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",
    "the rate of increment @xmath6 of the type @xmath7 is given by its absolute fitness , denoted with @xmath8 , balanced with the average fitness of the population @xmath9 , which has the form @xmath10 in evolutionary game theory the vector of absolute fitness @xmath11 is defined as a linear function of the population @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the matrix of payoff that rules the interplay between different strategists . in this regard ,",
    "the fitness of the type @xmath7 is defined as the result that an individual of that type gets colliding against another individual on average , i.e. @xmath15_{k}=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{d}u_{ki}x_{i}.\\ ] ] however , it is clear that the basic element for the generation of evolutionary novelties are mutations .",
    "the first attempt of giving account of mutations , dating back to the 1970s , is the so called `` quasispecies equation '' , where the growth rate of each species is modified by considering the dispersion due to the birth of mutated offspring .",
    "the same underlying idea has been included in the evolutionary games setting in @xcite with the `` replicator - mutator '' equation : @xmath16 here the coefficient @xmath17 express the proportion of offspring of @xmath18-type from a progenitor @xmath19 , which shows up at any procreation .",
    "an important aspect of mutations stands in their randomness , which is quite underrated in . since then many more refined models have been proposed to put into the right light randomness",
    "; we refer for instance to @xcite showing that one single stochastic microscopic process can generate different macroscopic models of adaptive evolution .",
    "more recently , in @xcite , it has been proposed a macroscopic stochastic model where mutations occur at a different time scale than selection .",
    "this approach goes into the direction of adaptive dynamics , but differentiates from trait substitution sequence because it is not assumed that there is complete adaptation ( namely invasion or extinction of the mutant trait ) between subsequent mutations .",
    "this aspect is well - suited especially within the framework of social dilemma , or more generally when the type @xmath20 are read as strategies more then species or phenotypes .",
    "see also the numerical paper @xcite , focused on prisoner s dilemma .    in this paper",
    "we take a step further and address our attention to the environment , seen as a place where individuals can evolve but also as a factor that can influence the dynamics of interaction between strategists . the model presented in @xcite",
    "is then expanded to take into account how the natural environment can modify the interactions between individuals , changing selective pressures ; we add a new variable @xmath21 to the variable @xmath12 , in the simplex , so that the status of the population is described by the pair @xmath22 .",
    "the new variable @xmath23 stands for the position of the population or , more widely , for an external parameter that affects the results of the interplay between strategies .",
    "it changes according to a velocity , partly deterministic , partly stochastic , and influences the selection mechanism because the payoff matrix depends on @xmath23 .",
    "+ the interpretation is twofold : from one hand , one could start with a single population with status @xmath24 and look at how it evolves exploring an heterogeneous environment , subject to selection and mutation . on the other hand one could also start with a sort of meta - population composed by different subpopulations and",
    "observe how its distribution evolves . in this sense selection only acts inside subpopulations : melting of different subpopulation is not easily introduced into a frequency - based model like the present one .",
    "this aspect certainly deserves a further investigation .    in the following section [ modellosde ] we recall the stochastic model for replicator dynamics with point - type mutations introduced in @xcite . with the aim of performing monte - carlo simulations",
    ", we give an alternative ( but equivalent ) description of the process by using a single poisson random measure .",
    "starting from this description , we generate an algorithm to simulate our process .",
    "next , the spatial environment is introduced as a further stochastic variable , whose dynamics is ruled by a sde .",
    "therefore , we end up with two coupled sde for the character - position variables @xmath22 : see , .    in section [ fokkerplank ]",
    "we derive a fokker - plank integro - differential equation for , , ( see later on ) .",
    "the classical regularity assumptions requested by the hormander theory are not satisfied because of the presence of a non - local term , which is the deterministic counterpart of the point process modeling mutations .",
    "we therefore read it in the viscosity sense , even if the problem does not fit plainly in the standard framework of viscosity solutions for integro - differential equations : the main difficulty comes from the domain where it is set , which is closed .",
    "actually , the model does not justify any attempt to impose a boundary condition .",
    "moreover the nonlocal term does not depend continuously on @xmath12 .",
    "these difficulties are overcome by extending in a suitable way the problem to the whole space and noticing that the produced solution can actually be interpreted as a probability density for the couple character - position @xmath22 .",
    "finally , section [ simulazioni ] provides numerical simulations for the probability density obtained by a monte - carlo method starting from the stochastic system , , using matlab .",
    "we consider the two strategist game hawks vs doves , used by maynard smith to explain the high frequency of conventional displays , rather than all - out fight , among animals ( especially within heavily armed species ) @xcite .",
    "we modify the standard model by assuming that the cost for fighting changes according to the location , and show how an equilibrium for the replicator - mutator equation can be disrupted by effect of random motion or mutations .",
    "we also notice that in some particular cases , space itself allows for the survival of the low fitness species .",
    "we propose to describe the frequencies of different phenotypes in the population according to a stochastic differential equations ( sde ) in the general framework @xmath25 here @xmath26 is a process on a probability space @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are borel measurable functions of appropriate dimensions .",

    "the process of classic replicator dynamics ( [ eq : replicator dynamics ] ) is obtained when @xmath39 is the vector of relative frequencies of @xmath0 various phenotypes , @xmath40 is the vector of relative fitness , i.e. @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are null , so that ( [ eq.stocastica generale ] ) is totally deterministic .    in @xcite",
    ", mutations are described by means of a pure point process that alters replicator dynamics and the brownian motion term is zero ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "any mutation has a fixed progenitor ( type @xmath19 ) and a unique descendant ( type @xmath46 ) : this gives @xmath47 different mutations , precisely all those that transform a type @xmath19 in a type @xmath46 as @xmath48 the mutation from type @xmath19 to type @xmath46 is driven by a non - homogeneous point process @xmath49 with stochastic intensity @xmath50 .",
    "the process @xmath49 makes unit jumps with a frequency depending on the process itself , according to the `` genetic distance '' between the types @xmath19 and @xmath46 ( @xmath51 ) and the fitness of @xmath19 ( @xmath52 ) : the higher the fitness , the higher the rate of reproduction of individuals of that kind , the more they will suffer mutations .",
    "a further coefficient @xmath53 measures the proportion of individuals involved in mutations : the population of type @xmath19 decreases by a fraction @xmath54 , while the population of type @xmath46 increases by the same amount .",
    "this yields a jump of the population frequency vector of size @xmath55 , @xmath56 standing for the unit vector pointing in the direction @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting sde is @xmath57 let us notice by now that the number of variables depicting the character can be reduced by observing that @xmath58 and setting the problem in the closed set @xmath59 with a little abuse of notations we shall continue to write @xmath60 and @xmath61    in the same paper @xcite , a kolmogorov integro - differential equation describing the expected frequencies is derived and investigated analytically , with particular attention to the long term equilibrium .",
    "analytical investigation is satisfactory in the case of constant fitness ( quasispecies equation ) , but there are some gaps concerning variable fitness , that has been tackled by a numeric approach in the subsequent paper @xcite . in the present work",
    "we are mainly concerned with monte - carlo simulations .",
    "that is why , before enriching the model by including the effect of heterogeneous environment , it is worth giving an alternative description and present an algorithmic approach .",
