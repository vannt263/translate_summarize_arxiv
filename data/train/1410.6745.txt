    "figure [ fig8 ] shows @xmath151 versus the well width scaling factor @xmath149 for @xmath159 , calculated with alda and pgg .",
    "for pgg we see in each case that @xmath151 smoothly approaches its limiting value for the strictly 2d plasmon , shown by the dashed line .",
    "the alda initially approaches the 2d limit as @xmath149 decreases from 1 .",
    "however , around @xmath157 all alda curves turn around and rapidly drop off , moving away from the 2d limit .",
    "thus , we find that the 3d alda exchange kernel behaves reasonably as long as the well width is sufficiently large .",
    "the breakdown for intrasubband ( in - plane ) dynamics occurs for @xmath160 .",
    "interestingly , this is significantly smaller than the critical _ inter_subband width @xmath161 , see section iii.b .",
    "in this paper we have carried out systematic numerical studies of the electron dynamics in quantum wells whose width @xmath18 crosses over from the 3d to the quasi-2d regime ( where only the lowest subband is occupied , but the finite size is still relevant ) and finally to the strictly 2d limit ( where @xmath162 ) .",
    "the purpose was a comparison of different classes of exchange kernels in tddft : standard semilocal kernels ( such as alda and pbe ) and nonlocal kernels ( such as pgg and istls ) .",
    "alda and pbe are based on the electron gas as reference system , whereas pgg and istls are orbital functionals , whose definition does not invoke any reference system .",
    "the main conclusion does not come as a surprise : alda and pbe fail in the 3d-2d crossover , pgg succeeds .",
    "this is already well known for the ground state,@xcite and there was no reason to expect otherwise for the dynamical case .",
    "however , the details are interesting and of practical relevance .    first of all , we discover a universal behavior of the breakdown of the inter- and intrasubband dynamics in 3d alda . at a critical well width of @xmath161 ,",
    "intersubband plasmons are no longer qualitatively correctly described ( the charge plasmon falls below the single - particle excitation @xmath108 ) . for well widths below @xmath163 ,",
    "intrasubband plasmon dispersions start to become suppressed compared to the 2d limit .",
    "the interesting finding is thus that @xmath164 , so the in - plane dynamics appears to be well described using the 3d alda down to much smaller widths than the out - of - plane dynamics .",
    "compared to the ground state , the failure of the ( semi)local xc functionals in the dynamical case is of a different nature .",
    "in fact , while the exchange energy diverges for @xmath107 , intersubband plasmons can still be reasonably described ( apart from the fact that they drop below the p - h continuum,@xcite which is an artifact of these functionals ) . in turn",
    ", intrasubband plasmon dispersions become suppressed and cease to exist , instead of approaching the limit of 2d plasmons .    in practice , it is important to know for what quantum well widths the 3d alda is still applicable . for instance , if @xmath165 ( which is a very typical value for many semiconductor quantum well samples ) , we find @xmath166 nm for gaas , which is rather narrow .",
    "higher sheet densities allow one to push this limit to even narrower wells ; and the breakdown for intrasubband dynamics occurs at even smaller well widths , as low as a few  .",
    "this is certainly good news , considering the popularity of the alda and its ease of implementation .",
    "we also find that these values can be significantly higher for the pbe ; in other words , using gradient - corrected xc functionals for quantum wells does not seem to pay off .    clearly , the best option to describe the dynamics in strongly confined systems is using nonlocal orbital functionals such as pgg or istls , since these are not tied to a particular choice of reference system ( such as the 2d or 3d alda ) and hence have no problem with dimensional crossover",
    ".    finally , let us say a few words about correlation . in the ground - state,@xcite it was observed that local and semilocal correlation functionals break down in a similar manner as exchange functionals .",
    "this will also be the case for the dynamics .",
    "however , nonlocal , orbital - dependent correlation functionals are much more complicated than exchange functionals ; for instance , implementing the istls beyond exchange in linear response will remain a task for the future .",
    "there is another aspect of correlation that is unique to the dynamical case , namely , it leads to dissipation of plasmon excitations even outside the particle - hole continuum .",
    "plasmon damping in quantum wells has been studied within time - dependent current - dft,@xcite using the complex and frequency - dependent xc kernel of vignale and kohn.@xcite this xc kernel is a local approximation of the current , and can lead to overdamping of charge plasmons.@xcite the effect is even more dramatic for spin plasmons , where the damping due to the spin coulomb drag effect is significantly overestimated using a local approximation.@xcite again , it is found that the cure to this overdamping is provided by orbital functionals.@xcite    this work was supported by doe grant",
