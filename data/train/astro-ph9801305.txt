    "magnetic activity has been extensively studied from the onset of the convective envelope amongst f stars down to the hydrogen burning limit ( as reviewed by @xcite ) .",
    "comparatively little is known about the activity of population ii stars  recent studies of population ii stars have addressed chromospheric activity of single stars ( @xcite ) and x - ray emission in binary systems ( @xcite , hereafter ofp ) , but these studies targeted near - solar mass stars rather than very - low - mass stars .",
    "nevertheless , the population ii m subdwarfs are worthy of study because stars with @xmath5 are thought to be fully convective for all metallicities ( @xcite ) , and therefore may have a different dynamo mechanism than solar mass stars which have radiative / convective zone boundaries ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ".    moderate resolution spectra of very - low - mass stars allow the identification of high activity ( `` dme '' ) stars by the presence of @xmath0 emission lines while at the same time allowing the classification ( @xcite , hereafter g97 ) of metal - poor stars as sdm ( m subdwarfs ) and esdm ( extreme m subdwarfs ) . in our recent palomar / michigan state university ( pmsu )",

    "our four echelle spectra of gl 455 clearly indicate it is a double - lined spectroscopic binary , but do not provide enough data to determine the orbital parameters . in the first two spectra ( 31 dec . and 4 jan . ) , the absorption lines from both components are resolved , with the cores separated but the wings overlapping .",
    "the other two spectra ( 6 jan . ) do not show line doubling .",
    "the small shift ( @xmath34 km s@xmath2 ) seen for the observations separated by two hours suggests the period is much longer than gl 781 s period .",
    "we note that the velocity data are consistent with a @xmath35 or @xmath36 day period .",
    "it should also be noted that since the lines are never completely separated we can not rule out the possibility that there is a ( fainter ) third star in this system ; g97 showed that the two components of gl 455 appear to lie above the sdm sequence in the hr diagram even after correcting for binarity .",
    "we do not detect rotational broadening in this system , indicating that @xmath37 km s@xmath2 . since our resolution is insufficient to detect rotational broadening in most dme ( @xcite ) , this limit on the rotation",
    "is not surprising .",
    "if the period is 8 days , then we estimate that the equatorial rotational velocities are @xmath38 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0 emission of gl 455 ab is not resolved , so the reported equivalent widths are for the combined spectrum . in the december 1995 spectrum",
    ", the @xmath18 line is resolved sufficiently to show that both components are in emission .",
    "significant variability is present : the four equivalent widths of @xmath0 are @xmath39 and @xmath18 are @xmath40 .",
    "our earlier moderate - resolution spectrum ( @xcite ) had an @xmath0 equivalent width of less than @xmath41 .",
    "we therefore adopt the @xmath0 equivalent width of @xmath42 as a `` typical '' value for the discussion of this system s activity level .",
    "our july 1996 spectrophotometry indicates that the continuum flux near @xmath0 for the two unresolved components is approximately @xmath43 ergs @xmath27 s@xmath2 @xmath28 .",
    "we therefore estimate the `` typical '' @xmath0 flux to be @xmath44 ergs @xmath27 s@xmath2 for each star under the assumption of equal - luminosity components .    we have searched the rosat all - sky survey ( @xcite ) to determine if the sdme are x - ray sources .",
    "we match gl 781 with 1rxs j200503.8 + 542609 and gl 455 with 1rxs j120219.1 + 283507 . the hardness ratio ( hr1 ) given in the catalog is nearly identical with the hardness ratio ( hr ) used by schmitt _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 to study nearby dm and dme stars .",
    "we therefore determine the count rate - to - energy conversion factor ( cf ) using their equation @xmath45 the derived x - ray fluxes and other stellar parameters used in this paper are given in table  [ fluxes ] .",
    "the observed mass function of the system and the theoretically estimated mass of gl 781 a imply that gl 781 b is more probably more massive ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "together with the fact that no lines are seen , this mass implies that gl 781 b is a faint , cool white dwarf .",
    "the line strengths , colors , and absolute magnitude of gl 781 a are similar to other sdm , so we estimate that the white dwarf is @xmath47 magnitudes fainter , i.e. @xmath48 . ordinary white dwarfs ( @xmath49 )",
    "have ages @xmath50 years at this luminosity ( @xcite ; we have used the liebert _",
    "_ 1988 bolometric corrections ) .",
    "as shown below , the most likely possibility is that gl 781 b is a @xmath51 helium white dwarf  the corresponding lower limit on the age is @xmath52 years ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of rotational broadening serves as a constraint on the possible system parameters . assuming that the gl 781 a s rotational period is the same as that of the system , @xmath53 the radius of the star is not known but can be estimated , either from stellar interior models , or by using the bolometric corrections and effective temperatures from model atmospheres ( @xcite ) as fit by g97 . using the latter method",
    ", we estimate @xmath54 and @xmath55 , so @xmath56 .",
    "this estimate is in good agreement with stellar interior models ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then find that we expect @xmath57 to be @xmath58 km s@xmath2 , compared to the observed @xmath59 of @xmath60 km s@xmath2 , suggesting the system is viewed nearly edge on , with @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath62 is indeed near unity , then the white dwarf companion has an unusually small mass .",
    "gravitational redshift measurements show that the distribution of white dwarf masses in wide binaries is strongly peaked at @xmath63 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this peak mass can not be reconciled with the radius of gl 781 a deduced from the observed luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "thus , the observations require that gl 781 b is about half the mass of the typical relatively isolated white dwarf .",
    "the small present day separation of the two stars , @xmath64 , implies that gl 781 a was engulfed when gl 781 b became a red giant .",
    "( recall that the present day brighter component , the sdm , was then the secondary by both mass and luminosity ) .",
    "there was therefore a phase of common envelope evolution . since the mass of gl 781 a is @xmath12 and the original mass of gl 781 b was @xmath65 ( since it has already evolved and cooled ) , it is clear that the mass ratio was greater than @xmath66 when the gl 781 b became a red giant and first engulfed the companion .",
    "iben & livio ( 1993 ) have reviewed this situation and shown that a common envelope will form and that the secondary ( gl 781 a ) will not accrete a significant amount of mass . after being engulfed , gl 781 a caused mass loss from gl 781 b , possibly ending b s evolution as a he white dwarf with relatively low mass ( @xmath67 ) instead of allowing b to become a co white dwarf ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this would be consistent with the estimate of @xmath62 from the detected rotational broadening .",
    "the calculations of iben _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) indicate that for systems with 12 hour periods , helium white dwarfs with very - low - mass ( @xmath69 ) main sequence companions should be about seven times more common than co white dwarfs with very - low - mass main sequence companions .      for m dwarfs , membership in a very close ( @xmath70 days )",
    "binary system is thought to be a sufficient condition for high chromospheric activity  rapid rotation at relatively old age is maintained by tidal interactions between the two stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both gl 455 and gl 781 prove to be short period binaries , with gl 781 a having detectable rotation , and we therefore attribute their activity to their binary nature .",
    "gl 781 a s companion is not likely to affect the activity ( except by being the cause of gl 781 a s rapid rotation ) . although red dwarfs near hot white dwarfs show @xmath71 emission due to reprocessing of the white dwarf s euv flux in the chromosphere of the red dwarf ( @xcite ) , gl 781 b s low luminosity ( @xmath72 ) implies that it is not a significant source of euv flux . furthermore ,",
    "gl 781 a s emission is not stronger from the hemisphere facing the white dwarf , since there is no correlation between the strength of @xmath0 with orbital phase in the august 1996 data .",
    "the white dwarf is therefore not causing the emission by incident radiation or other line - of - sight effects .",
    "we also attribute the x - ray flux to a normal corona generated by gl 781 a s rapid rotation , rather than accretion onto the white dwarf , since at present gl 781 a is only about @xmath73 of the size of its roche lobe as estimated by eggleton s ( 1983 ) formula .",
    "we note also that the x - ray flux is not due to some sort of `` basal '' emission unique to subdwarfs since none of the known sdm and esdm without @xmath0 emission are detected in x rays by rosat .",
    "metal - poor stars are usually associated with an extremely old ( @xmath74 yr ) population . preston _",
    "( 1996 ) , however , have identified young , a - type metal - poor main - sequence stars with large velocities which they suggest are the residue of a merger with a satellite galaxy ( or galaxies ) .",
    "presumably these stars have lower mass counterparts , and if the m subdwarfs have emission lifetimes comparable to field m dwarfs ( @xcite ) , then these young m subdwarfs will show detectable @xmath0 emission",
    ". we can not directly rule out either gl 455 or gl 781 as members of this young , metal - poor population .",
    "the cooling time for the white dwarf in gl 781 is at least 2 gyr , which is too long to maintain the observed rapid rotation if m subdwarfs lose angular momentum like field m dwarfs .",
    "overall , the binary nature of the two systems appears to be sufficient to explain their activity .",
    "the properties of sdme relative to ( near - solar metallicity ) dme are important because they provide a unique perspective on the generation of strong activity .",
    "gl 781 a and gl 455 ab are the only known highly active , metal - poor , cool main sequence stars .",
    "gl 781 a is of particular interest because its high rotational velocity is similar to the rotational velocities observed in the pleiades cluster members of the same mass ( @xcite ) . in comparing the properties of the sdme , it should be be remembered that considerable dispersion exists in the chromospheric and coronal properties of even coeval , homogeneous samples such as the pleiades and hyades clusters , and that even larger dispersion exists in field samples .",
    "the physical causes of this dispersion are unknown .",
    "thus any relations based upon only two systems must be viewed with caution .",
    "we first note that the data suggest that the chromospheres and coronae of the sdme are quite similar to disk dme stars , despite the great metallicity difference between the two classes .",
    "the sdme x - ray hardness ratios , which are sensitive to the coronae temperatures , are comparable to the field dme with similar x - ray luminosities",
    ". the ratios of @xmath0 to @xmath18 fluxes are similar to that seen in field dme stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the strength of the he d3 line is normal compared to the @xmath0 line , as is the strength of the he 6678 line compared to the he d3 line .",
    "the correspondence between this sdme and the dme suggest that the physical properties ( e.g. , temperature ) of the lower chromosphere ( traced by the balmer lines ) , upper chromosphere ( helium lines ) , and corona ( x - ray ) do not depend strongly on metallicity .",
    "we measure the overall activity of each star using the ratios of the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath75 ) and the @xmath0 luminosity ( @xmath76 ) to the star s bolometric luminosity .",
    "we focus on gl 781 a since we know the orbital period and @xmath77 , allowing a comparison to disk dme stars with similar rotation rates .",
    "gl 455 a and b are more slowly rotating than gl 781 a , but the period is unknown .",
    "jones _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) have measured @xmath77 for m dwarfs in the pleiades using the keck i telescope .",
    "the nine stars with @xmath78 , similar to gl 781 a s mass of @xmath12 , have measured velocities in the range 8 km s@xmath79 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these results suggest that we can directly compare the metal - poor star gl 781 a to a population of stars with similar masses and rotation rates .",
    "although this means two important parameters are the same , there are three notable differences between gl 781 a and the pleiads : first , gl 781 a s age is most likely 10 - 15 gyr , and certainly is 2 gyrs or more which is @xmath80 times the age of the pleiades cluster ; second , gl 781 a is metal - poor ( @xmath3 \\approx -1.2 $ ] ) whereas the pleiades have near - solar metallicity ; third , gl 781 a s companion might induce internal and surface differential rotation different from that of single stars ( @xcite ) .    direct comparison to the pleiad sample observed by jones _",
    "is hampered by the small sample size and lack of x - ray data for most of their stars .",
    "we instead compare to the much larger survey of the pleiades cluster reported by hodgkin _",
    "( 1995 , hereafter hjs ) .",
    "the hjs survival analysis of both detections and upper limits indicates that stars with masses near @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) have _ mean _ @xmath83 and @xmath84 of @xmath85 and @xmath86 . the range in activity is large , as some detected stars have @xmath87 while many stars have upper limits indicating @xmath88 .",
    "gl 781 a s ratios are quite to close to the mean values , and on this basis the activity of a rapidly - rotating metal - poor star appears to be virtually identical to its more metal - rich counterparts  although factors of @xmath89 in the log of the activity level can not be ruled out . on the other hand , gl 781 a",
    "is an order of magnitude weaker in x - ray activity than the strongest m dwarfs in the pleiades . as noted by hjs , the reason why these sources are stronger is unknown .",
    "indeed , it interesting to note that many of the slowest rotators in the jones _ et al .",
    "_ sample have the strongest @xmath0 emission  an expanded data sample would be of considerable interest to establish the nature of a rotation - activity relation for this stellar mass .",
    "we finally note that the hyades cluster offers another point of comparison to the sdme sample .",
    "again , the _ mean _ ratios of @xmath4 and @xmath90 for the hyades m dwarfs ( @xcite ) are similar to the ratio seen in gl 781 a.    we may also compare the activity of the sdm binaries to that of nearby field dm binaries . like the m subdwarfs , these m dwarfs have activity induced by the rapid rotation caused by very close companions .",
    "we have detected a further 16 sb2 m dwarf binaries using the same echelle configuration as used for the current observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "none of these systems have @xmath77 as great as gl 781 a ; all are likely to have orbital periods less than 5 - 10 days . matching these objects with the rosat",
    "all sky survey , we find that four have @xmath91 whereas twelve have @xmath92 ( with four systems at the maximum of @xmath93 ) . if rotation were the most important parameter , one might expect gl 781 a to be as active in x - rays as the most active nearby binaries . in this case ,",
    "gl 781 a is deficient by about 0.4 in the log ( a factor of 2.5 ) .",
    "it should also be recalled that the range in observed @xmath0 equivalent widths is 1.0 to 1.9 , which suggests that some of the difference in activity level could be due to gl 781 a happening to be in a relatively weak state at the time of the rosat observations .",
    "( 1995 ) have found that over a decade m dwarfs , unlike the sun , do not show variability in x - rays in excess of a factor of 2 .",
    "one of the most striking aspects of the sdme data is that both systems show similar x - ray activity levels despite their different rotation rates .",
    "ab certainly has a much slower rotation rate than gl 781 a , indeed , @xmath94 is much weaker in gl 455 ab .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the gl 455 ab x - ray observation is affected by a flare or other transient event .",
    "there are a few m dwarfs in the hyades ( @xcite ) which have @xmath95 for non - simultaneous measurements , so gl 455 ab s relative activity levels are not unprecedented .    comparing the sdme to the near - solar mass hyades binaries detected by stern",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) , gl 781 a has an x - ray activity level similar to that of the gk - dwarf ( @xmath96 ) binaries with periods of a few days but is less active than the half - day period binary v471tauri .",
    "given the large mass differences , we conclude merely that this example suggests that it is not unreasonable to expect that gl 781 a s half - day period should put it amongst the most active binaries  and therefore that gl 781 a may be mildly x - ray subluminous .",
    "there is , however , considerable evidence that the rotation - activity relationship is complex in low - mass stars ( indeed , hawley _",
    "_ 1996 questioned the existence of a correlation between rotation rate and activity level in m dwarfs ) .",
    "( 1997 ) have found that for a sample of hyades m dwarfs ( @xmath97 ; above the fully - convective limit and more massive than the sdme ) that there is no single activity - rotation relation .",
    "they propose that their data can be explained as a `` bifurcation '' with two different rotation - activity relations . on one relation , relatively slowly rotating stars ( @xmath98 km s@xmath2 ) can be as active ( @xmath99 ) as stars ( on the other relation ) with @xmath100 km s@xmath2 .",
    "they suggest that the difference is due to differing rotational evolution histories which results in differing radial and latitudinal differential rotation .",
    "they also find that stars with companions as distant as 1 a.u .",
    "have enhanced activity relative to single stars with the same rotation rate .",
    "in addition , there is evidence that the most rapid ( @xmath101 hr . )",
    "gk rotators may weaken in activity level ( @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , there are many parameters relevant in determining the activity level  these or others may be important for gl 781 a.    we conclude that gl 781 a does not show evidence for a significant ( i.e. , factor of 10 ) weakening in its activity levels relative to near - solar metallicity stars .",
    "it may , however , be subluminous in x - rays for its bolometric luminosity by up to a factor of @xmath102",
    ". this may be the result of its metal deficiency .",
    "definite conclusions are prevented by the large , and as yet poorly - understood , dispersion in the activity levels of m dwarfs .",
    "the relatively small effect on the x - ray emission due to a factor of @xmath103 deficiency in metals suggests that composition is not a major contributor to the dispersion in activity levels observed for m dwarfs , which are all relatively close to solar metallicity ( @xmath3 \\gtrsim -0.6 $ ] , @xcite ) .",
    "the ofp survey of spectral type fgk metal - poor binaries has shown that a sample of population ii short - period binaries analogous to rs cvn binaries are at least one order of magnitude less x - ray luminous than the disk rs cvn binaries , although some population ii binaries are as luminous as the rs cvn binaries . they have suggested that the x - ray line emission is reduced due to the relative lack of metals in the corona of population ii systems with @xmath104 < -0.4 $ ] .",
    "our sdme lie in the low - metallicity end of that range .",
    "based upon our discussion above , we conclude that the sdme are not as x - ray subluminous as expected by analogy with the ofp results .",
    "we have obtained spectra of two halo very - low - mass metal - poor systems that show @xmath0 and x - ray emission . both prove to be close binary systems , which accounts for their high activity level .",
    "we deduce that gl 781 a s unseen companion is a cool white dwarf .",
    "the present - day orbital period of 12 hours implies that the system passed through a phase of common envelope evolution .",
    "gl 455 ab consists of two near - equal luminosity sdme .",
    "the strength of the x - ray coronae of the sdme relative to the @xmath0 chromosphere is well within the range observed in dme stars in the field and in young clusters .",
    "gl 781 a s level of activity , as measured by the ratio @xmath4 , is comparable to the mean activity level in the pleiades .",
    "the comparison to both the pleiades and field dme binaries suggest that gl 781 a is no more than a factor of @xmath102 subluminous in x - rays due to its metallicity .",
    "this is contrast to the factor of ten observed in most ( but not all ) stars in the ofp survey of more massive metal - poor binaries .    with only two sdme systems ,",
    "these results are necessarily uncertain .",
    "unfortunately , it will be difficult to significantly increase the sample of sdme and esdme since the two systems discussed here are the only such binaries detected amongst a total of 68 lhs catalog sdm and esdm stars observed from palomar ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . a more optimistic view , however , is that activity due to rapid rotation could allow the identification of , or place limits upon the existence of , short - period binaries and/or relatively young ( few gigayear ) halo populations given a large spectroscopic sample .",
