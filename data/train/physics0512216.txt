    "each financial market has different characteristic features but they are expected to have some similar and scale - invariant properties in common .",

    "the former is supposed to open for a short term of six months while the latter continues without breaks except for holidays .",
    "it is furthermore shown that there exists a similarity in the correlation of returns for both of these markets .",
    "several studies on the dynamics of financial markets have recently focused on the understanding of the fat - tailed pdf of the price changes .",
    "it has been shown from previous works @xmath4 $ ] that price changes in the empirical dollar - mark exchange rates is regarded as a stochastic markov process for different delay times .",

    "@xmath71 , we obtained the following approximations for the ktb@xmath24 and s@xmath0p @xmath1 stock index : for s@xmath0p @xmath1 stock index @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the ktb@xmath24 @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eqs .",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 , we obtained the exponential term by solving the simultaneous equations from a pair of two conditional conditions , in this case @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are chosen to satisfy the condition , @xmath85 .",
    "the analogy between turbulence and the foreign exchange market was well described and argued in ref .",
    "@xmath61 $ ] .",
    "here we extend the argument to the stock and futures exchange markets .",
    "although , as mentioned previously , the ktb@xmath24 has a short - term expiration different from the s@xmath0p@xmath1 stock index , they both show good agreement in the form of the kramers - moyal coefficients .",
    "we here stress again that the fokker - planck approach can be a suitable method to analyze the financial tick data and in understanding the statistics of their returns .",
    "furthermore , we present a nonlinear langevin equation , here an underlying stochastic process , by showing that the kramers - moyal coefficients vanish for @xmath86 ( see fig .",
    "@xmath87 ) .",
    "it can be particularly confirmed that the third moment of kramers - moyal coefficients vanishes . in eq . @xmath80 and @xmath81 ,",
    "the exponential terms are too small to be negligible when compared to other terms .",
    "hence , from the estimated results we can obtain a linear stochastic equation with multiplicative noise , as a quadratic noise ornstein - uhlenbeck process , as follows : for s@xmath0p @xmath1 stock index , @xmath88 for the ktb@xmath24 , @xmath89 from eqs .",
    "@xmath90-@xmath81 we can see that the ktb@xmath24 has a greater drift and diffusion coefficients than the s@xmath0p@xmath1 stock index .",
    "this implies that the former is more dynamic than the latter .",
    "furthermore , the volatility of returns has considerable influence upon the deterministic trend in that the diffusion coefficient @xmath49 is somewhat comparable to the drift coefficient @xmath91 .",
    "we have showed that the fokker - planck approach can be a good method for the analysis of the financial markets in a wide spectrum . even for a short - term expired financial market such as the korean treasury bond futures we could obtain a well - fitted result describing the behavior of its pdf in time delays .",
    "we have also obtained the same stochastic process from both analyzed financial markets irrespective of their data acquisition frequency .",
    "quantitative measurements of deterministic and random influences for both futures and stock markets imply that the futures market is more dynamic than the stock market .",
    "this paper has shown that the temporal correlation of the futures market can be described well in terms of fokker - planck equations .",
    "particularly , the ktb@xmath24 is transacted for a short term of six months in the korean financial market , but it is striking that its functional form of the kramers - moyal coefficients is approximately consistent with that of other assets .",
    "moreover , the comparison of the drift and diffusion coefficients with various financial markets provides us with a numerical indicator for the creation of portfolios and risk management strategies . in the future",
    ", it will be of interest to compare our results with those of other national options .",
    "thereby we can measure and compare the stability and the efficiency of various financial markets .",
