    "type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are used as distance indicators for cosmology . from sne",
    "ia we deduce that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite . they are also crucial for the study of galactic chemical evolution because they expel iron .",
    "however , the exact nature of their progenitors remains unclear and it is still uncertain whether a double - degenerate ( dd ) or single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario dominates . in the dd scenario two carbon - oxygen ( co )",
    "white dwarfs ( wds ) can produce a sn  ia while merging if their total mass is larger than @xmath1 . in the sd scenario , a co wd explodes as a sn  ia if its mass reaches @xmath1 while accreting from a non - degenerate companion such as a main - sequence ( ms ) star or slightly evolved subgiant in the wd+ms channel , a giant star in the wd+rg channel or the symbiotic channel or a helium star @xcite .",
    "a progenitor model can be tested by comparing the predicted distribution of the time between star formation and sn  ia explosion with that observed .",
    "this ranges from less than @xmath2yr to more than @xmath3gyr",
    ". a significant number of sne  ia have taken the longest times @xcite . though the dd scenario can reproduce such delays the sd scenario can not , except in the study by @xcite who assumed that the wind from the wd strips the outer layers of the red giant ( rg ) at a high rate ( their mass - stripping effect ) .",
    "they showed that symbiotic stars are likely progenitors of sne  ia with long delays .",
    "@xcite have claimed that supersoft x - ray ( ssx ) fluxes in early type galaxies are much smaller than expected if the sd scenario were to dominate sne  ia production .",
    "however @xcite argue that this ssx flux is actually rather strong evidence in favour of the sd scenario in early type galaxies and that the progenitors are symbiotic stars .",
    "there are at least four recurrent symbiotic novae , such as rs  oph or t  crb , that have a very massive wds .",
    "they are thought to have red giant companions of mass @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to reproduce these systems in standard binary evolution because dynamical instability in mass transfer sets in when the giant fills its roche lobe . @xcite",
    "systematically studied binary evolution and established wd+ms and wd+rg paths to sne  ia by introducing three new physical effects , ( i ) the wind from the rg acts like a common envelope to reduce the separation for very wide binaries with separations up to about @xmath5 , ( ii ) the wd loses much of the transferred mass in a massive optically thick wind and ( iii ) their mass - stripping effect .",
    "they produced sne  ia at a rate comparable with that observed . * since then the only work to produce sufficiently high sn ia rates with long delay times was @xcite , who implemented all the three effects .",
    "other works adopted the above effects except mass - stripping in their population syntheses and found smaller sn ia rates .",
    "*    the concept of a compact object accreting from the stellar wind of a companion was used by @xcite to explain x - ray pulses in massive x - ray binaries .",
    "it is now generally included in population synthesis calculations such as those by @xcite , though @xcite did not include any wind accretion in their model .",
    "the surfaces of red giant stars are not tightly bound and so it is relatively easy to drive a cool wind .",
    "such winds might be enhanced by tidal or other interaction with a companion @xcite and so could remove significant mass and angular momentum from the giant s envelope before roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) begins .",
    "@xcite introduced this concept of companion reinforced attrition ( crap ) to explain mass inversion in rs cvn binaries and it has since been widely used to explain phenomena related to giant star evolution in binary systems , such as double degenerate objects , post - agb stars , barium stars , cataclysmic variable stars and bipolar planetary nebulae ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as potential progenitors of sne  ia",
    "symbiotic stars @xcite gain two advantages from crap .",
    "first the wd may grow in mass substantially by accretion from stellar wind before rlof and secondly mass transfer may be stabilized because the mass ratio ( @xmath6 ) can be much reduced at the onset of rlof .",
    "so the distribution of masses and periods from which sne  ia arise through the symbiotic channel is enlarged when crap is taken into account .",
    "here we study this for sne  ia with crap instead of @xcite s mass stripping effect .",
    "although both processes may occur in real systems we include only crap so as to isolate its effects .",
    "we evolve about 2,000 population  i ( with metallicity @xmath7 ) close wd+ms binary stars with eggleton s stellar evolution code @xcite .",
    "their co wd masses @xmath8 are 0.6 , 0.65 , 0.8 , 1.0 and @xmath9 , the initial orbital periods are between 10 and 10,000d spaced at intervals of @xmath10 and the companion , secondary masses @xmath11 in the range from 0.8 to @xmath12 .",
    "the tidally enhanced mass - loss rate from the secondary @xmath13 is modelled by @xcite formula with the extra tidal term included by @xcite so that @xmath14\\,m_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the radius and luminosity of the giant secondary , @xmath17 is its roche lobe radius , @xmath18 is reimers wind coefficient .",
    "we set @xmath19 .",
    "the wind enhancement parameter @xmath20 we set to 10,000 as required to fit z  her @xcite .",
    "thus the mass - loss rate @xmath21 could be 150 times as larger than reimers rate when the star more than half fills its roche lobe .",
    "some of the mass lost in the stellar wind of the giant may be accreted by the wd at a rate @xcite so that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the orbital velocity , g is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath24 is the semi - major axis of the orbit and @xmath25 is its eccentricity .",
    "we take @xmath26 because we expect orbits to have circularized by this time .",
    "the coefficient @xmath27 is an accretion efficiency and we set @xmath28 .",
    "we fix the wind velocity @xmath29 to @xmath30 and discuss this later . if @xmath29 or @xmath24 is small , the right hand side of equation  ( [ bhacc ] ) becomes large and so we add the limit @xmath31 .",
    "that part of the wind which is not accreted carries off the specific angular momentum of the donor star .",
    "before rlof begins stellar wind is the only way to transfer material to the wd so the mass transfer rate , @xmath32 . during rlof",
    "the mass is transferred in both a stream and the wind so that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is mass - transfer rate by rlof .",
    "we continue the practice of limiting the rate at which the wd can accrete @xcite by the prescription of @xcite .",
    "this accounts for the limited rate at which hydrogen can burn and for mass loss in both hydrogen and helium novae .",
    "thus @xmath35 hydrogen accretion is controlled by @xmath36 where @xmath37 , equal to @xmath38 , is the accretion rate below which hydrogen novae expel most of the material and @xmath39 is the critical accretion rate above which hydrogen can not burn as it is accreted but is instead expelled in an optically thick wind .",
    "helium accretion is then further controlled by @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "that part of the mass transferred but ultimately not accreted carries off the specific orbital angular momentum of the white dwarf .    in figure",
    "[ example ] we show the evolution of a binary system which ends as a sn  ia .",
    "initially @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the wind enhancement factor @xmath45 .",
    "we see three phases of co  wd growth to @xmath46 at which carbon ignites degenerately .",
    "first , wind accretion becomes important at about @xmath47yr when the accretion is sufficient for hydrogen to burn as it accretes .",
    "stable mass transfer dominates for a short time of around @xmath48yr .",
    "finally wind accretion continues after the system has detached because the orbit grows faster than the giant .",
    "the supernova occurs when the secondary s mass has fallen to @xmath49 just as it is about to leave the red giant branch and shrink to a white dwarf .    at @xmath50yr ( @xmath51yr in figure  [ example ] )",
    "the enhanced mass - loss rate reaches its maximum of 150  times reimers rate . in this case",
    "the wd is able to accrete all the wind and @xmath52 .",
    "this is an extreme case of small @xmath53 , corresponding to the short orbital period edge of the space that leads to sne  ia for an initially @xmath54 co  wd ( see figure  [ grid ] below ) . at longer initial periods",
    "the wd reaches @xmath46 before rlof occurs so there is no stable mass transfer phase . for much wider systems and for more massive secondaries , that ignite helium non - degenerately and consequently do not grow very large on their first ascent of the giant branch , similar evolution occurs when the secondary is on the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "figure  [ grid ] shows the results of our binary evolution calculations in an initial period  secondary mass plane for various initial wd masses .",
    "no sne  ia arise when @xmath55 .",
    "whether a co wd reaches the critical mass to explode as a sn  ia depends on both the amount of mass transferred and the efficiency at which this can be accreted by the co wd . in each panel contours enclose the progenitors of sne  ia . only for the very high initial white dwarf masses , of @xmath9 , can a massive secondary star drive a sn  ia . these stars",
    "ignite helium non - degenerately and so do not grow large enough to transfer sufficient mass while on their first ascent of the giant branch . thus , only those initially massive enough to retain enough envelope mass to transfer via a wind on the first ascent of the giant branch are able to reach sne  ia . in this case",
    "the initial mass of the secondary ought not to be larger than the progenitor of the wd .",
    "this determines our upper limit for the upper region in panel  ( d ) and explains why this region is absent for lower - mass wds .",
    "the other regions are more interesting because they are more populated by virtue of the stellar mass function . for these",
    "the low secondary mass boundary is due to the limited amount of mass available for transfer from the lower - mass companions .",
    "the long period boundary is due to the efficiency of burning and accumulating the transferred material .",
    "the high secondary mass and low period boundary are both due to the onset of rlof and dynamically unstable mass transfer because crap has not removed enough mass .",
    "carbon burning then begins more gently in the heated outer layers of the wd and a supernova is avoided .    to examine the effect of crap in more detail we repeated our calculations for an initially @xmath56 wd with @xmath57",
    "( see figure  [ 1p00 ] ) . as @xmath20 decreases the progenitor region shrinks and vanishes as @xmath58 .",
    "this is consistent with the claim of @xcite that there is no symbiotic channel to sne  ia . for comparison , the progenitor region found by @xcite",
    "is also shown in this figure .",
    "our model extends the possible progenitor periods by almost a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "the velocity @xmath29 of the companion s wind is important because it strongly affects @xmath60 .",
    "however the growth rate of the co wd @xmath61 is not always sensitive to @xmath29 because @xmath61 is limited by @xmath39 when the mass accretion rate is large enough ( equation  [ mdotcrit1 ] ) .",
    "thus once @xmath13 is larger than about @xmath62 the dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath29 becomes small because only about 10percent or less of @xmath13 is required for the co wd mass to increase at @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath13 is closer to @xmath64 the co wd may not increase at all if @xmath29 is large .",
    "our choice of @xmath65 is an estimate of the lower limit to the poorly modelled wind velocity .",
    "we choose it to demonstrate that such a channel to sne  ia can exist but note that our progenitor region would shrink in places if @xmath29 were larger and ( b ) @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a terminal wind velocity of typically @xmath68 for a giant star and @xmath69 is calculated according to @xcite . in both cases",
    "the progenitor regions shrink with the longest period systems not reaching sufficient wd masses to ignite .",
    "for example the upper period boundary moves to @xmath70 for @xmath71 and no sne  ia are predicted at all when @xmath72 in case  ( a ) . ] .",
    "figure  [ m2p - sn ] shows the regions in the final period  secondary mass space at which the wd reaches @xmath46 for various initial co wd masses .",
    "the region for a @xmath56 co  wd calculated with the mass - stripping effect @xcite is superimposed in the figure . as for the initial systems",
    ", these regions extend to longer orbital periods .",
    "two symbiotic stars , that are considered possible progenitors of sne  ia , t  crb and rs  oph , with orbital periods 228d @xcite and 454d @xcite , are plotted under the assumption that @xmath73 .",
    "both are located well inside the region of sne  ia progenitor regions for our models but lie on the edge of what might be expected with mass stripping .",
    "figure  [ grid ] shows how the crap enhanced symbiotic channel would be very effective if many binary stars with a massive co  wd and an unevolved companion could form with periods between about @xmath74  and @xmath75d .",
    "however conventional population synthesis calculations tend to produce such systems either with @xmath76d following the ejection of a common envelope or with @xmath77d if they have avoided rlof . on the other hand we do observe symbiotic stars , such as t  crb and rs  oph , with massive wds and orbital periods around 1yr .",
    "@xcite describe one way in which these systems , and consequently many like them , could have formed by shrinking a wide orbit in a process similar to common envelope evolution but by interaction with the stellar wind . to obtain the frequency of sne",
    "ia produced by our channel we really ought to carry out a full population synthesis from the zero - age main sequence but here we apply the procedure explained by @xcite in their sections  4.3 and  4.4 so as to get a direct comparison with their rate .",
    "we divide the wd masses into the ranges given in our table  [ table ] and calculate the integral in equation  ( 1 ) of @xcite , @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the typical progenitor masses of the wds at each end of the range .",
    "the integral then accounts for the initial mass function .",
    "we calculate the initial range of mass ratios , @xmath81 , for a given wd mass by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the upper and lower limits to the sne  ia progenitor regions identified directly from figure  [ grid ] . by formula  ( [ tutukov ] )",
    "we assume that the mass ratio is uniformly distributed between @xmath85 and  @xmath86 . with the quantity",
    "@xmath87 we assume that the initial period distribution is flat in @xmath88 and that this difference is unchanged by the evolution up to the point of figure  [ grid ] so that we may read it from the figure directly for the particular wd mass .",
    "we then calculate a simple mean rate @xmath89 of the two extremes .",
    "our total sne  ia rate is @xmath0 , significantly larger than that calculated by @xcite with their mass - stripping .",
    "this rate is very uncertain and probably overestimated because we , as did they , have used cuboid shaped regions in the initial parameter space but it is not dissimilar to the actual observed rate for a galaxy like our own .    .",
