    "over the past fifteen years , there has been tremendous progress in the field of parity and time - reversal ( @xmath0 ) symmetric quantum theory  @xcite ; this progress is further spurred by recent experiments on optical waveguides  @xcite and electrical circuits  @xcite . as it was in the case of original quantum theory ,",
    "the theoretical developments have occurred on two distinct fronts .",
    "the first is investigations of schrdinger equation in the presence of non - hermitian , @xmath0-symmetric , complex potentials @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the second is the study of non - hermitian , @xmath0-symmetric band matrices  @xcite that can represent the hamiltonian for a tight - binding lattice with on - site , balanced , loss - and - gain potentials  @xcite .",
    "the developments on these two fronts have been with little overlap .",
    "the continuum studies have focused on properties of the schrdinger equation in the complex co - ordinate plane  @xcite ; notable early exceptions are `` particle in a box '' problem with two simplest potentials , @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2 $ ]  @xcite . in either of these cases , there is a nonzero threshold , measured in the units of relevant energy scale , for the emergence of complex eigenvalues . in corresponding lattice models with complex , constant potential or a pair of impurities , the @xmath0-breaking threshold , measured in the units of tunneling , vanishes as lattice size @xmath7 diverges  @xcite except in the case of closest or farthest impurities  @xcite . however , on both fronts , the @xmath0-symmetric potential is typically characterized by a single parameter and the energy eigenvalues are real as long as the _ magnitude _ of that parameter is smaller than the threshold value .    in this paper , we study the effect of competition between smooth ( @xmath8 ) and localized ( @xmath9 ) complex potentials on the @xmath0-symmetric phase diagram .",
    "we consider a particle in a box of size @xmath10 in the presence of @xmath11 , and its lattice counterpart , and calculate the phase diagram in the @xmath3 plane as a function of the localized - gain position @xmath12 .",
    "surprisingly , we find that a broken @xmath0-symmetric state induced by one potential can be restored by additional losses to the loss region , with corresponding gains in the gain region , introduced by the second potential .",
    "we find that the phase diagrams for @xmath13 and @xmath14 are qualitatively different . with scaling analysis",
    ", we show that the robust phases of the continuum model are consistent with the fragile phases of its lattice counterpart .",
    "let us consider a particle of mass @xmath15 confined to a line @xmath16 with dirichlet boundary conditions for its wave function , @xmath17 . when @xmath18 , the complex potential @xmath1 represents a constant gain potential for @xmath19 , with a mirror - symmetric loss region for @xmath20",

    "the effect of @xmath28-functions at @xmath29 on the eigenfunctions is given by the discontinuity in their derivatives at locations @xmath4 , @xmath30 eq.([eq : adiscont ] ) along with the continuity of the wave function at @xmath29 provide four relations among the four unknown coefficients @xmath31 .",
    "the complex wave vector @xmath32 satisfies @xmath33  @xcite . in the following analysis ,",

    "simultaneous solutions of eq.([eq : char ] ) and the constraint @xmath43 , obtained graphically , lead to the permitted values of @xmath32 and dimensionless energies @xmath44 respectively . as the strength of the complex potential is increased , two adjacent or next - nearest neighbor eigenvalues become degenerate and then presumably complex , leading to the breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry .",

    "this continuum model has nonzero thresholds @xmath103 or @xmath62 below which the @xmath0-symmetry is unbroken .",
    "on the other hand , the lattice models of these two potentials have a fragile @xmath0-symmetric phase , defined by vanishing threshold strengths , except when the localized gain or loss impurities are closest or the farthest  @xcite .",

    "let us consider a lattice with @xmath104 sites , nearest - neighbor spacing @xmath105 and tunneling @xmath106 , with open boundary conditions . in the continuum limit , @xmath107 , @xmath108 such that @xmath109 remains finite .",

    "thus , the continuum and lattice thresholds for fractional position @xmath97 are related by @xmath114 . for almost all values of @xmath97 ,",
    "the lattice phase is fragile , @xmath115 as @xmath108  @xcite .",

    ", the most promising or current candidates for experimental realization of a @xmath0-system can be modeled by tight - binding lattices and are explored via time - evolution of an initial state @xmath131 that is localized to a few , if not single , lattice sites  @xcite .",
    "such a localized state contains energy components across the entire lattice bandwidth @xmath132 , and therefore can only probe the fragile @xmath0-symmetric phase of the lattice .",
    "we have shown that the robust or fragile nature of the @xmath0-symmetric phase is essentially determined by the relevant , continuum or lattice , energy scales .",
