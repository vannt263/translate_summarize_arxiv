    "preparation and manipulation of exotic quantum states of light are at the heart of quantum information science and technology @xcite .",
    "a central challenge for photonic systems is the non - deterministic nature of the generation of such states , which arises when considering parametric photon sources @xcite , such as those based on spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) or four - wave mixing ( fwm ) , and from the negligible interaction between photons @xcite .",
    "parametric sources of single photons have been the workhorse for proofs of principle to date because they generate photons in pairs , enabling heralding in highly pure spatio - temporal - spectral modes @xcite . however , parametric sources have a theoretical maximum heralding efficiency of 25% @xcite , sufficient for some communication and sensing applications , but short of the best known threshold for computation @xcite . as with other non - deterministic generation processes with heralded success signals , including fusion gates , for large - scale cluster states @xcite and all - photonic quantum communication @xcite , and ballistic entangled state generation @xcite , the success probabilities must be increased above relevant practical thresholds .    a promising approach is to actively multiplex ( mux ) these processes by operating several copies in parallel , such that the probability of at least one succeeding is high , followed by a low - loss switching network to route a successful output into the downstream system @xcite .",
    "spatial multiplexing of heralded photon sources @xcite , for example , has been successfully implemented with up to four heralded photon sources @xcite .",
    "temporal multiplexing @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : timemux ] ) would enable repeated use of the same physical process , reducing resources , system size and indistinguishability requirements , at the cost of introducing delay lines and reducing the system clock rate .",
    "temporal multiplexing has been proposed for single - photon @xcite and entangled state generation @xcite , as well as for photon memories @xcite , boson sampling schemes @xcite , and universal quantum computation @xcite .    here",
    ", we demonstrate active temporal multiplexing and use it to improve the success probability of a heralded single - photon source . by combining temporal with spatial multiplexing using a double - passed heralded source ,",
    "only a single physical source was used to enable hybrid spatial - temporal multiplexing of eight effective source repetitions .",
    "we show active temporal multiplexing of a source of periodic photons ( previous demonstrations have shown passive temporal multiplexing @xcite and active storage , but not multiplexing , of photons from non - periodic sources using cavities @xcite ) to increase the heralded photon rate , for a fixed noise level , by up to 76% compared to the same source without multiplexing .",
    "* principle of operation *    in a heralded single - photon source ( hsps ) , a pulsed laser pumps a nonlinear material , spontaneously generating photon pairs , called signal and idler photons , in a fixed time bin . assuming spectral disentanglement @xcite , the state after passing through the nonlinear material is given by an infinite superposition of fock state pairs @xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the idler and signal modes and @xmath3 is the squeezing parameter determined by the pump power and the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "multi - photon pairs generally result in detrimental effects in quantum circuits , necessitating low squeezing parameters so that the single - pair term in ( 1 ) dominates .",
    "filters are used to separate the signal and idler photon and the pump , and a single - photon detector placed on the idler arm is used to herald the presence of the signal photon . under ideal conditions and with number - resolving detectors ,",
    "the theoretical maximum single - photon emission probability of a hsps is limited to 25% @xcite , due to the presence of multi - photon pair terms in equation ( 1 ) . while this single - photon emission probability is sufficient for small - scale quantum optics experiments , heralded sources by themselves are not sufficient for scalable quantum technology @xcite .    a temporal multiplexing technique ( also referred to as time multiplexing ) @xcite , which uses a hsps , optical switches , delay line loops , and electronics for feed - forward ,",
    "can be used to boost the single - photon emission probability while keeping the multi - photon contamination low ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timemux ] shows the smallest example with one delay loop ) . in this scheme ,",
    "the hsps is pumped @xmath4 times per clock cycle with laser pulses spaced by time @xmath5 .",
    "signal photons are stored in a long delay line buffer as detection signals from the idler arm are analyzed . when a single photon is heralded in one of the @xmath4 time bins ,",
    "a switching network composed of delay line loops ( with lengths of integer multiples of @xmath5 ) is driven into a configuration which offsets the photon into a single spatial - temporal mode .",
    "if multiple photons are heralded in several input bins , the switching network automatically discards the extra photons by moving them into adjacent bins , thus ensuring that only a single photon is output in the time bin in sync with the system clock cycle .    with a sufficient number of time bins per clock cycle",
    ", a single - photon pair will be produced in at least one of the time bins with high probability .",
    "the probability of heralded single - photon emission from the multiplexed source is approximately ( see supplementary material iii for a detailed model ) :",
    "@xmath6    where @xmath7 is the probability that the hsps triggers during one time bin and @xmath8 is the probability that the triggered emission is a single photon after passing through the lossy switching network @xcite . with ideal operation and assuming a lossless switching network , 17 heralded source repetitions enable a source with > 99% single - photon emission probability @xcite , and assuming realistically small losses , @xmath98 - 16 heralded source repetitions enable a near - deterministic source with low multi - photon contamination for large - scale applications @xcite .",
    "even when considering heralded sources operating with efficiencies far below the theoretical maximum , as is the case with all parametric sources demonstrated to date , multiplexing can still be used to achieve an enhanced heralded single - photon emission probability per clock cycle for a fixed multi - photon contamination probability , offering the possibility of new classes of experiments in the near - term .",

    ", hybrid temporal and spatial multiplexing can be implemented with only a single parametric source .",
    "this scheme enables an additional enhancement to the single - photon emission probability without an additional loss penalty on the generated photons , since the same depth of switches as the temporal multiplexing scheme is used .",
    "* implementation *    our experimental set - up ( fig .",
    "[ exp ] ) uses a bulk periodically - poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) down - conversion crystal phase - matched to produce idler photons at 671 nm and signal photons at 1547 nm from a pump laser at 468 nm .",
    "these wavelengths enable high - efficiency detection of the idler photon using silicon avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) and low - loss transmission of the signal photon through switches and fiber delay lines .",
    "each pulse from a pump laser with a 80 mhz repetition rate ( 12.5 ns pulse spacing ) is frequency doubled and split into four pulses spaced by @xmath93 ns using a series of free - space delay lines constructed from beam - splitters and mirrors .",
    "the four pulses then pass through the ppln crystal and undergo collinear down - conversion , probabilistically creating photon pairs in four time bins in the first spatial mode ( referred to as pass 1 ) ; a return pass of the pump through the crystal , obtained by recycling the residual pump reflected from a mirror , creates four additional time bins in a separate spatial mode ( pass 2 ) . for each pass ,",
    "the four effective sources passively delayed in time are referred to as `` delays '' , e.g. pass 1 , delay 3 .",
    "the spectra of the signal photons from different delays of the same pass were shown to have a high degree of similarity ( mean of 97.9@xmath111.8% , see supplementary material ii ) , and moderate similarity between the two different passes ( mean of 92.8@xmath115.2% , see supplementary material ii ) .",
    "furthermore , an in - line polarizer was used to verify that the photons emitted from each source had identical polarization .",
    "the polarization - maintaining , active optical switching network ( see appendix a : methods ) is composed of low - loss fiber switches ( @xmath91 db loss per switch , 500 khz maximum operation frequency ) and two fiber delay loops matched to the free - space delay lines ( see fig .",

    "detection signal rising edges , which can fall in any of the four closely spaced time bins , are correctly discriminated using a fast oversampling field programmable gate array ( fpga ) ( see appendix a : methods ) , which then configures the switches for feed - forward multiplexing of the eight time and spatial modes . to avoid driving the switches",
    "faster than their maximum operation frequency , an asynchronous `` idle time '' of 2 @xmath12s was programmed into the fpga to limit the rate of detected heralding signals . during heralding detection , feed - forward processing , and switch configuration ,",

    "the data was taken for fixed `` reference powers '' , defined as the average power of the pump laser in front of the ppln crystal used to generate the photons in the _ multiplexed _ source .",
    "then , by blocking all beam paths in the free - space delay lines except for one at a time , a fraction of the reference power was used to pump each of the non - multiplexed sources individually ( @xmath925% for pass 1 delays and , due to power loss , @xmath912.5% for pass 2 delays ) .",
    "this procedure allows for a fair comparison of the coincidence , accidental , and triggering rates between the multiplexed source and its constituent non - multiplexed sources .",
    "the triggering rates were affected by saturation loss caused by the large asynchronous `` idle time '' programmed into the fpga to avoid triggering detection faster than the limited switch operation frequency ( 500 khz ) . with the overall clock rate of the source set by the 80 mhz repetition rate of the pump laser",
    ", the multiplexed source suffered from greater saturation effects at high powers due to this deadtime than the less - deterministic non - multiplexed sources , as can be seen in the sharp bending of the data away from a linear trend as the reference power is increased in fig .",

    ", the rates of coincidences for the multiplexed sources were suppressed due to the saturation of triggering events , as predicted by our model ( supplementary material iii ) .",
    "although the triggering and coincidence rate statistics provide evidence that our set - up implements temporal multiplexing , the key measure of performance for our multiplexed source is the heralded photon rate for a fixed coincidence - to - accidental ratio ( car ) .",
    "the car serves as a measure of noise due to single - photon emission and multi - photon contamination probabilities ; this measure of noise can not be inferred from coincidence rates alone .",

    "however , the 8@xmath10 multiplexed source exhibited an increased heralded photon rate between 33 - 59% , for the same car , over the best non - multiplexed source , and between 47 - 76% over the mean from the non - multiplexed sources ( pass 1 only ) , demonstrating a direct improvement ( fig .",

    "this enhancement can be mapped to a comparable increase in the single - photon emission probability for a fixed multi - photon emission probability ( see supplementary material iv ) .",
    "we demonstrated temporal and spatial multiplexing of eight photon bins in a hybrid setup to enhance the heralded photon emission statistics compared to non - multiplexed sources .",
    "although our demonstrated improvement was limited by the maximum operation frequency of the switches , we note that even low rate , high efficiency multiplexed sources will likely find applications in the near term , due to the increased single - photon generation probability per clock cycle .",
    "therefore , a possible solution is to use a pulse picker to limit the repetition rate of the laser source to the maximum repetition rate of the switches .",
    "ultimately , multiplexed sources with the highest single - photon emission rates will require the development of a lower - loss , high - speed optical switch ( recent , promising prototypes include kerr effect @xcite and electro - optic based @xcite switches ) .",
