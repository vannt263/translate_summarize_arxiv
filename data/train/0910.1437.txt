    "the motivation of the recent interest in neutrino - nucleus interactions is twofold .",
    "one one hand ongoing and future high precision neutrino oscillation experiments increasingly rely on our knowledge of neutrino - nucleus interactions in both charged current ( cc ) processes of the type @xmath1 , where a virtual @xmath2 boson is exchanged , and neutral current ( nc ) reactions @xmath3 , where a @xmath4 boson is exchanged .",
    "typical neutrino energies involved in these experiments are of a few gev . in this region a large contribution to the cross section comes from quasielastic and resonance processes , where the nuclear dynamics is known to play an important role . since many electron scattering data exist at these kinematics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , we should be able to use them to predict neutrino cross sections .",
    "as we will show , the superscaling properties of inclusive @xmath5 data represent a bridge between electron and neutrino scattering reactions off nuclei .",
    "a second motivation consists in the fact that neutrinos can reveal informations on the nuclear structure complementary to electrons and they can be used to probe the internal structure of the nucleon ( in particular the axial mass and the strange form factors ) , providing the nuclear content of the problem is under control .    in this contribution we will first review the phenomenon of superscaling in inclusive electron - nucleus scattering  @xcite and",
    "then show some predictions for @xmath6-@xmath7 cross sections based on the superscaling approximation ( `` susa '' )  @xcite .",
    "we will then discuss the microscopic origin of the superscaling function , with particular focus on two models , the relativistic mean field ( rmf )  @xcite and a bcs - like correlated fermi gas  @xcite , which seem to correctly reproduce the shape of the @xmath5 experimental data , at variance with other relativistic models .",
    "finally we will address the issue of scaling violations , in particular the ones connected to meson - exchange currents .",
    "the experimental quasielastic @xmath5 cross sections display the so - called `` first kind scaling ''  @xcite behaviour : at high momentum transfer ( @xmath8 larger than about 0.5 gev / c ) the reduced quasielastic cross section @xmath9 does not depend on two variables ( @xmath8 , @xmath10 ) but only on one combination of them , called the scaling variable and indicated by @xmath11 in a non - relativistic scheme and @xmath12 in a relativistic context .",
    "these two scaling variables represent respectively the minimum momentum @xmath13 or kinetic energy @xmath14 that a nucleon inside the target nucleus must have in order to participate to the reaction . the conditions",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond , in the non - relativistic and relativistic case respectively , the quasielastic peak ( qep ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that if the reduced function ( [ f ] ) corresponding to different kinematical conditions is plotted as a function of @xmath17 it fulfills with good accuracy first kind scaling in the so - called scaling region @xmath18 , whereas at @xmath19 scaling is broken .",
    "second kind scaling consists instead in the observation that for different target nuclei the reduced cross section scales as the inverse of the fermi momentum @xmath20 , so that the so - called _ superscaling function _ @xmath21 is independent of the specific nucleus .",
    "this has been illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that scaling of second kind is excellent in the scaling region and slighthly violated at the right of the qep .",
    "if first and second kind scaling are simultaneously respected the cross sections are said to `` superscale ''",
    ". a closer inspection of the rosenbluth - separated longitudinal and transverse response functions shows that the scaling violations observed at @xmath22 mainly reside in the transverse channel , essentially due to the @xmath0 resonance contribution .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us briefly remind the basic formalism for inclusive electron scattering , focussing on the longitudinal channel where superscaling is seen to work better . in plane wave impulse approximation the longitudinal quasielastic response function can be expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the kinematically allowed region in the @xmath25 plane , @xmath26 being the excitation energy of the residual nucleus and @xmath27 its momentum , @xmath28 is the nuclear spectral function and @xmath29 the single nucleon response , which depends on the electric and magnetic nucleon s form factors .    assuming that the single nucleon response @xmath29 is smoothly varying in the @xmath25-plane and can be factored out of the integral one gets @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the longitudinal scaling function .",
    "note that the above factorization can be only approximately true in a relativistic context and it is violated to some degree due to off - shell effects and breaking of independent particle models .",
    "the simplest model where one can perform exact relativistic calculations is the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) , namely an independent - particle model in which on - shell nucleons are described by dirac spinors . in spite of its simplicity",
    "the rfg model retains some fundamental properties : it is lorentz covariant and gauge invariant and is therefore a good starting point for more sophisticated calculations .",
    "the rfg spectral function is @xmath32 and the corresponding scaling function is @xmath33 where the parabola @xmath34 is the superscaling function and @xmath35 is the rfg scaling variable .",
    "the rfg model exactly superscales , as the data do in the so - called scaling region",
    ". however the comparison with the averaged data , illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scal ] , shows that the corresponding superscaling function is very different from the experimental one and in particular it fails the reproduce the long tail displayed by the data at large positive @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig : scal ]   resonace ( right panel ) regions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    resonace ( right panel ) regions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    however a simple phenomenological approach can be taken for describing the qe region : a fit of the experimental superscaling function can be extracted from the data and plugged into the rfg formulas in place of the parabola ( [ eq : frfg ] ) .",
    "note that the fit involves only four parameters for describing _ all _ kinematics and _ all _ nuclei .",
    "moreover , it represents a strong constraint on nuclear models , since any reasonable model used to describe the quasielastic region must reproduce this shape .",
    "the scaling analysis has been recently extended to the @xmath0 resonance region  @xcite . in order to isolate the contributions in this region , the impulsive contributions arising from quasielastic @xmath37 scattering , calculated assuming superscaling is valid , has been removed from the experimental total cross section and the result has been divided by the elementary @xmath38 cross section , thus leading to a new superscaling function @xmath39_{\\delta } }      { \\sigma _ { m}\\left [ v_{l}g_{l}^{\\delta } + v_{t}g_{t}^{\\delta } \\right ] } ~.\\ ] ] when the latter is plotted against the appropriate scaling variable @xmath40 , which accounts for the different kinematics through the inelasticty paramater @xmath41 , the result shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scal ] is obtained .",
    "obviously this approach can work only at @xmath42 , since at @xmath43 other resonances and the tail of dis contribute .",
    "the two above superscaling functions can then be used to reconstruct the @xmath5 cross sections in the qe and @xmath0 regions , giving a satisfactory description of the data , as shown in ref .",
    "we shall now illustrate how the superscaling properties of inclusive electron scattering can be exploited to predict neutrino cross sections off nuclei .",
    "charged current neutrino - nucleus scattering can be easily linked to inclusive @xmath5 reactions by replacing the virtual photon by a wirtual @xmath2-boson .",
    "the main difference is that in the neutrino case , beyond the longitudinal and transverse response functions , a third response is involved , arising from the axial component of the weak current . in the rfg model",
    "the three response functions turn out to be @xmath44 where the functions @xmath45 depend on the weak nucleon form factors and the information about the nuclear dynamics is carried by the superscaling function @xmath46 .",
    "the basic assumption of the susa approximation is that the nuclear dynamics governing the neutrino - nucleus process is the same entering the electron scattering reactions and therefore the corresponding cross sections in the qe and @xmath0 regions can be obtained by simply replacing in ( [ eq : wresp ] ) the rfg superscaling function with the corresponding phenomenological fits : @xmath47 .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : xx ] the double differential cross section in the qe and @xmath0 regions is shown for ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more results ) : it clearly appears that in both regions the susa result lies significantly lower and extends over a wider range in @xmath48 than the rfg . in the right panel",
    "the susa fully integrated quasielastic cross section  @xcite on @xmath49 is shown as a function of the neutrino energy and compared not only with the rfg but also with other relativistic models : the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model , the relativistic plane wave impulse approximation ( rpwia ) and a semi - relativistic shell model without ( srws ) or with ( srws - tot ) inclusion of discrete states of @xmath50 .",
    "note that the rmf yields results which are very similar to the susa prediction , whereas the other models are closer to the rfg .",
    "the comparison of these results with the recent miniboone data  @xcite , which lie above the rfg and seem to point to a very high value of the axial mass ( @xmath51 gev in place of the usual value 1.03 , which we are using in our calculations ) , is somehow puzzling and still needs to be carefully explored .",
    "[ fig : xx ]   versus the outgoing muon momentum @xmath52 , showing a comparison of the susa results ( black online ) with the rfg ( red onleine ) ; the separate qe and @xmath0 contributions are shown with dashed lines .",
    "right : integrated qe cross section versus the neutrino energy evaluated in different models.,title=\"fig : \" ]   versus the outgoing muon momentum @xmath52 , showing a comparison of the susa results ( black online ) with the rfg ( red onleine ) ; the separate qe and @xmath0 contributions are shown with dashed lines .",
    "right : integrated qe cross section versus the neutrino energy evaluated in different models.,title=\"fig : \" ]    concerning neutral current neutrino reactions , it has been proved in ref .",
    "@xcite that , although the kinematics is not the same of @xmath5 reactions because the outgoing detected particle is the knocked nucleon instead of the lepton , the susa approach can still be used in the qe channel to predict cross sections .",
    "the result is qualitatively similar to the cc case , namely the susa predictions are lower the rfg and the response estends to a wider region . as anticipated an interesting feature of nc reactions is their sensitivity to the strangeness content of the nucleon , which allows in principle to extract informations on the strange hadronic form factors by different combinations of neutrino and antineutrino scattering off protons and neutrons  @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in the examples of figs .",
    "[ fig : strpn ] , where it is seen that for proton knockout ( left panels ) the magnetic strangeness decreases ( increases ) the @xmath6 ( @xmath53 ) cross section , while the axial strangeness increases both @xmath6 and @xmath53 cross sections . for neutron knockout ( right panels ) and",
    "@xmath6 scattering the situation is reversed with respect to p - knockout , while for @xmath53 scattering the effect of magnetic strangeness is very small due to cancellation between the vector and axial - vector responses .",
    "[ fig : strpn ]",
    "in this section we will briefly illustrate the results of two relativistic models which , although sensibly different , seem to reproduce the basic properties of the experimental quasielastic superscaling function , namely a scaling behaviour of both first and second kind and a long high energy tail .",
    "the first model is the relativistic mean field model , based on a lagrangian containing strong scalar and vector potentials ( corresponding to @xmath54 , @xmath10 and @xmath55 mesons ) and describing the bound nucleon states as self - consistent dirac - hartree solutions .",
    "the final state interactions ( fsi ) are described in distorted wave impulse approximation using the same relativistic potentials  @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] ( left panel ) the rmf model provides the correct amount of asymmetry , unlike other relativistic models , also shown in the same plot .",
    "these correspond to the absence of fsi ( rpwia ) and to a treatment of fsi through a real optical potential ( rrop ) .",
    "it clearly emerges from the results that not only relativity , but also a consistent treatment of the initial and final states are required in order to get the observed asymmetry of the scaling function .",
    "morevoer , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model fulfills superscaling with good accuracy .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] evaluated in the rmf model compared with other models ( see text ) ; right : @xmath56 in the bcs - like model for different values of the parameter @xmath57 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    a completely different model , which we will refer to as `` bcs - like '' , has been shown to give very similar results  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] ( right panel ) .",
    "it is a simple covariant extension of rfg which accounts for nn correlations through the following wave functions @xmath58|0>\\ ] ] for the initial and final states , respectively .",
    "the @xmath59-coefficients are taken phenomenologically as fermi - dirac distributions with one free parameter @xmath57 , controlling the tail of the momentum distribution @xmath60 .",
    "the associated superscaling function @xmath56 turns out to be asymmetric in @xmath36 , the asymmetry increasing with the value of @xmath57 , and to reproduce the data for values of @xmath61 c / mev .",
    "the superscaling properties of the bcs - like model have been explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that both kinds of scaling are good at the qep and broken to some degree at the right and left of it .",
    "at low momentum and energy transfer ( which can be defined approximately by @xmath62 mev / c and @xmath63 mev ) the scaling approach is bound to fail because collective effects , like giant resonances , become important .",
    "however even at higher energies scaling violations are observed and it is very interesting to understand their origin .    among other possible contributions , like _ e.g. _ short range correlations , meson - exchange currents ( mec ) can certainly play a significant role in breaking superscaling in the transverse channel .",
    "the mec , being two - body currents , contribute to both the 1p-1h and the 2p-2h sectors of the response and their calculation is far from trivial in a relativistic context .",
    "moreover in order to preserve gauge invariance , in parallel with the pure mec diagrams , where the virtual photon attaches to the exchanged meson , it is necessary to take into account the corresponding correlation diagrams , where the photon attaches to the nucleon . up to now an exact gauge invariant relativistic calculation has been performed only in the rfg system and in the 1p-1h channel  @xcite . here",
    "the diagrams are the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mec ] , where thick lines in ( d)-(g ) represent either a nucleon or a @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that the diagrams involving the @xmath0 give the dominat contribution and they break both kinds of scaling , as illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mec ] .",
    "moreover a recent calculation  @xcite performed in a semi - relativistic shell model essentially equivalent to the rmf with fsi has shown that the mec contribution to the high energy tail of the response can become very large due to the dynamical nature of the pion propagator , an effect which is emphasized by the presence of fsi .    in the 2p-2h sector",
    "the pure mec have been calculated on the rfg basis  @xcite and shown to give a substantial contribution at high negative and positive values of @xmath36 , but a full gauge invariant calculation is still missing .     in the rfg ( @xmath64 ) and including the @xmath0-mec diagram for different values of @xmath8 ( upper panel ) and @xmath20 ( lower panel).,title=\"fig : \" ]   in the rfg ( @xmath64 ) and including the @xmath0-mec diagram for different values of @xmath8 ( upper panel ) and @xmath20 ( lower panel).,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we have shown how the superscaling properties of @xmath65 data can be exploited to predict charged and neutral current neutrino scattering cross sections and we have proposed two microscopic relativistic models , the rmf model and the bcs - like correlated fermi gas , which are capable of reproducing the experimental superscaling function , in particular its long high energy tail .    however ,",
    "in order to assess the applicability of the susa approach and eventually improve the method we need not only to justify the microscopic origin of superscaling but also to understand its violations , in particular the ones associated with meson exchange currents .",
    "this has been partially accomplished in recent work  @xcite and more effort will be done in this direction in order to provide a consistent description of the nuclear dynamics in the quasielastic , resonance and deep inelastic regions .",
