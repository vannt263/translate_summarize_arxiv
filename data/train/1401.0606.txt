    "dna double helix is a strong polyelectrolyte which in aqueous solutions dissociates into macromolecular polyanion and mobile cations ( counterions ) @xcite . under the natural conditions",
    "the counterions are positively charged metal ions ( usually na@xmath1 or k@xmath1 ) that neutralize negatively charged phosphate groups of macromolecule backbone .",
    "the counterions and water molecules form an ion - hydrate shell around dna stabilizing the structure of the double helix @xcite . in spite of significant mobility of counterions",
    "they are organized as the dynamical structure around macromolecule .",
    "this structure may be rather regular due to the homogeneity of dna backbone @xcite .",
    "the ordering of counterions around dna macromolecule determines the elastic properties of the double helix ( bending , twisting , denaturation ) , dna interaction with biologically active compounds ( proteins , drugs ) , and compaction mechanisms of macromolecule in small volumes ( chromosomes , viral capsids ) @xcite .",
    "the study of dynamical ordering of dna counterions is of paramount importance for understanding the mechanisms of dna biological functioning .",
    "effects of dynamical ordering of counterions around dna double helix may become apparent in conductivity experiments due to the interaction of charged particles of the solution with the electric field .",
    "as known the electric current in dna water solutions is caused by the motion of counterions and dna macromolecules @xcite . in case of dna solutions without added salt ( salt free solution ) the conductivity increases as the concentration of dna increases because of counterion dynamics in the ion - hydrate shell of macromolecule @xcite .",
    "heating the system the conductivity gradually increases , and under the temperatures of the double helix melting there is a sudden change of conductivity that is caused by intensive ejection of counterions from dna ion - hydrate shell @xcite . in case of dna solution with added salt the conductivity of the system depends on the both counterion type and salt concentration @xcite .",
    "the dependence on counterion type is caused by different electrophoretic mobility of ions mostly @xcite , while the dependence on salt concentration may reflect the ordering of the ions in solution .",
    "the experimental data show that under the low concentration of added nacl salt the conductivity of dna solution is higher than the conductivity of nacl electrolyte solution , but starting from some defined concentration the conductivity of dna solution becomes lower than the conductivity of electrolyte @xcite .",
    "the reason of such concentration dependence of conductivity of dna solutions is not determined yet .    to elucidate the microscopic picture of conductivity process in dna solution the phenomenological approaches",
    "have been developed , and atom - atom calculations have been performed @xcite .",
    "the results have been showed that the dynamics of counterions in close vicinity to dna surface is modulated by the charged atomic groups of the double helix backbone .",
    "part of the time counterions spend in complex with dna ( about 1  ns ) and another part in free state @xcite .",
    "free counterions determine the conductivity of dna solution in many respects that has been taken into consideration in phenomenological models @xcite . in the same time , the counterions , tethered to the phosphate groups , form ordered dynamical structure along dna backbone that may be considered as the lattice of ionic type ( ion - phosphate lattice ) @xcite .",
    "the existence of the ion - phosphate lattice is confirmed by observing the modes of ion - phosphate vibrations in the low - frequency raman spectra of dna ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the ordering of counterions around the double helix and the formation of the ion - phosphate lattice should affect the conductivity of dna water solutions .",
    "the goal of the present work is to study the manifestations of counterion ordering around dna double helix in conductivity experiments of dna water solutions with added salt . to solve this problem",
    "the conductivity of dna water solutions with kcl salt is studied experimentally in the section 2 . as the result the concentration dependence ( 0@xmath42 m ) of conductivity of dna solutions is obtained at temperature range from 28 to 70 @xmath0c ( section  [ res ] ) . for the interpretation of experimental data the phenomenological model is developed basing on electrolyte theory ( section  [ model ] ) . in the section  [ disc ]",
    "possible mechanism of ionic ordering around dna double helix is discussed .",
    "the samples have been prepared using sodium salt of dna from salmon testes purchased from sigma - aldrich company ( product number d1626 ) .",
    "the average length of dna macromolecules is about 2000 base pairs @xcite . to prepare the samples of dna water solutions",
    "the powder of dna has been diluted in deionized water to the concentration 10  mg / ml . to decrease the viscosity of dna solution it has been treated by the laboratory automatic mixer and than cooled to the @xmath5c without freezing of water . than the initial solution has been diluted to 2  mg /",
    "ml concentration of dna , and kcl salt has been added to this solution .",
    "the concentrations of added salt in the obtained solutions are as follows : 0.4 , 0.8 , 1.2 , 1.6 , and 2  m. water solutions without dna but with the same concentrations of kcl salt have been also prepared . as the result two series of the samples have been prepared : kcl electrolyte solutions , and water solutions of dna with kcl salt .    to measure the resistance of the sample",
    "the solution ( about 0.3  ml ) is poured into cylindrical capillary made of quartz glass with two platinum electrodes ( electrode 1 and electrode 2 ) and one wolfram electrode ( electrode 3 ) incorporated into the capillary walls ( fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ) .",
    "the experimental cell is placed into thermostat .",
    "the resistance has been determined by alternating current with the frequency 80  mhz .",
    "the measured resistance has the contributions from polarization of the sample and electrodes . to exclude the electrode contribution the measurements",
    "have been performed for different pairs of electrodes : 1 and 3 , 2 and 3 ( fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ) . the resistance in this case",
    "may be presented as follows : @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are measured resistances between electrodes 1 and 3 , 2 and 3 , respectively ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the distances between electrodes 1 - 3 and 2 - 3 , respectively ; _ r _ is the capillary radius ; @xmath12 is the specific conductance , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the resistances of platinum and wolfram electrodes , respectively .",
    "the first terms in equations ( [ r13 ] ) and ( [ r23 ] ) describe the resistance of the sample , while the second and the third terms describe the polarization resistance of electrodes .",
    "the difference of formulae ( [ r13 ] ) and ( [ r23 ] ) gives the following formula for conductivity of the sample : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the distances between electrodes 1 - 2 .",
    "using the formula ( [ sigma3 ] ) the conductivity of the samples are determined .",
    "the temperature dependences of electrical conductivity of salt solution ( @xmath17 ) and solutions of dna with added salt ( @xmath18 ) are obtained ( fig .",
    "[ sigma(t ) ] ) .",
    "the results show that the conductivity of the samples increases as the temperature increases for all considered samples .    according to the activation mechanism of ion motion in the solution the temperature dependence of conductivity of the system",
    "may be considered analogically to the arrhenius equation for the temperature dependence of chemical reaction rates @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the coefficient ; @xmath21 is the potential barrier ; @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant ; @xmath23 is the temperature .",
    "the exponent describes the probability of ionic jumping over the potential barrier due to the thermal fluctuations . to analyze the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity",
    "let us use the arrenius coordinates , describing the logariphm of conductivity as the function of transverse temperature . from formula ( [ sigma4 ] )",
    "it is seen that the temperature dependence of conductivity in arrhenius coordinates should be linear .",
    "the arrhenius plot for salt free solution of dna ( fig .  [ arr]a ) shows that there are two braking points separating distinguishable linear ranges .",
    "linear ranges in the arrhenius plot characterize melting process of dna double helix @xcite .",
    "the range i ( 28@xmath437  @xmath0c ) and iii ( 54@xmath470  @xmath0c ) features the double stranded and single - stranded dna , respectively .",
    "the range ii ( 37@xmath454  @xmath0c ) characterizes denaturation of dna macromolecules . in case of dna with added salt the difference between linear ranges in the arrhenius plot is not prominent and braking points are hardly distinguishable ( fig .  [ arr]b ) .",
    "the influence of added salt may be explained by additional neutralization of the negatively charged atomic groups of the double helix by salt ions .",
    "different ranges in arrhenius plot characterizes different activation energy of ionic motion in the solution .",
    "the values of potential barrier @xmath21 are determined as a slope of the lines in fig .",
    "[ arr ] ( table  [ barrier ] ) .",
    "the results show that in salt free solution of dna before the melting temperature ( range i ) the activation energy is rather large comparing to the electrolyte solution ( about 25  kj / mole ) . in the transition range ( range ii ) the activation energy ( about 43  kj / mole ) increases almost twice comparing to the range i that is effectively caused by the ejection of counterions from dna ion - hydrate shell @xcite . under the melting temperatures ( range iii )",
    "@xmath21 values decrease .",
    "4.5pt    .values of potential barrier @xmath21 for the ion motion in dna solution ( kj / mole ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ barrier ]    in the solutions of dna with added salt the potential barriers @xmath21 of different ranges are rather close . comparing to the salt free solution @xmath21 values only slightly decrease in case of the range i and range iii , while in case of the range ii it decrease more than twice .",
    "the fact of comparatively low activation barrier in the range ii indicates that the added salt increases the melting temperature of dna double helix that is also observed in calorimetric experiments @xcite .    increasing the concentration of added salt the conductivity of the both dna solution and electrolyte increases ( fig .",
    "[ sigma(t ) ] ) . to compare the conductivity of dna solution with added salt and the conductivity of kcl electrolyte solution the difference @xmath24 is analyzed ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the results show that at concentrations lower than some critical one ( about @xmath25 0.4  m ) the conductivity of dna solution is higher than the conductivity of salt solution ( @xmath26 ) . under the critical concentration ( @xmath27 ) the conductivity of dna solution and kcl solution are equal ( @xmath28  =  0 ) . starting from critical concentration ( @xmath29 )",
    "the conductivity of dna solution is lower than the conductivity of respective electrolyte ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the dependence of conductivity of dna solution on salt concentration at range from 0 to @xmath31 is about the same for different temperatures , while at the concentration range from @xmath31 to 2  m it is different for different temperatures .",
    "the changes of @xmath32 values should reflect the structure changes in dna solution .",
    "to understand the mechanism of electrical conductance of dna water solution let us analyze the state of dna macromolecule in the solution . due to the large contour length dna macromolecules",
    "are coiled shaped .",
    "the size of dna coils may be estimated with the use of the persistence model @xcite . in framework of this model",
    "the root - mean - square distance between the ends of macromolecule is determined as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the contour and persistence lengths of macromolecule , respectively .",
    "the contour length for dna from salmon testes is @xmath36  0.68  @xmath37 m @xcite .",
    "the persistence length of dna is @xmath38  500  a @xcite .",
    "using such parameters the average volume of dna coils is estimated 0.02  @xmath37m@xmath39 . taking into consideration that average number of dna macromolecules in 1  ml of the experimental solution is 10@xmath40",
    "the total volume of dna coils should be about 20  ml .",
    "one can conclude that macromolecule coils overlap in the considered solution and the conductivity process may be determined by mobile ions only , because the migration of single dna macromolecules is labored .",
    "the number of mobile ions involved in conductivity process is determined by the concentration of dna counterions and ions of added salt . taking this into consideration the conductivity of dna solution",
    "may be presented as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the conductivity determined by the motion of salt ions ( bulk ions ) ; @xmath43 is the conductivity determined by mobility of counterions in ion - hydrate shell of dna ; @xmath44 is the equivalent concentration of added salt .",

    "the second term in ( [ model8 ] ) describes the conductivity loss caused by the association of counterions with the phosphate groups of dna macromolecule .",
    "taking into account the formulae ( [ model6 ] ) , ( [ model7 ] ) and ( [ model8 ] ) the contribution of dna to the conductivity of polyelectrolyte solution ( @xmath53 ) may be determined as follows : @xmath54    the concentration of condensed ions may be considered proportional to the concentration of salt and concentration of dna phosphate groups , respectively : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 depend on concentration of added salt and describe the part of the ions condensed on macromolecule surface .",

    "in case of salt free solution ( @xmath44 = 0 ) the conductivity is determined by free counterions of dna and @xmath65 = 0 , thus @xmath66 . increasing salt concentration the degree of neutralization of dna surface increases , and under some concentration point ( @xmath27 ) all phosphate groups of the double helix",
    "become neutralized .",
    "since the counterions , attached to dna macromolecule , are not involved in the conductivity process the condition @xmath67=1 should be valid , thus @xmath68 .",
    "the ions of added salt condense on counterions that are already tethered to the phosphate groups of dna backbone , therefore @xmath69 = 0 , and @xmath70 .",
    "further increase of salt concentration leads to the crystallization of salt ions , and under some defined concentration ( @xmath71 ) the crystallization will be maximal that corresponds to the condition @xmath72 = 1 , and @xmath73 . taking into consideration these conditions the formulae ( [ model10 ] )",
    "may be written in the following form : @xmath74    the temperature dependence of ion mobility may be taken into consideration analogically to the equation ( [ sigma4 ] ) : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the characteristic equivalent mobility .",

    "the contribution of dna to the conductivity of polyelectrolyte is inessential ( @xmath85  =  0 ) when all phosphate groups of dna backbone are neutralized ( @xmath86 ) . note",
    "the developed model does not take into consideration the degradation process of dna macromolecules under the melting temperatures .",
    "to characterize the influence of dna macromolecules on conductivity of the system let us estimate @xmath32 by formula ( 12 ) .",
