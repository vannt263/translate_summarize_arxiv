    "according to dirac @xcite :    _ `` classical mechanics must be a limiting case of quantum mechanics .",
    "we should thus expect to find that important concepts in classical mechanics correspond to important concepts in quantum mechanics and , from an understanding of the general nature of the analogy between classical and quantum mechanics , we may hope to get laws and theorems in quantum mechanics appearing as simple generalizations of well known results in classical mechanics '' . _    in the dirac approach to quantum mechanics ,",
    "the carrier space is a hilbert space , i.e. it is a vector space endowed with a hermitian structure which give rise to a riemannian structure ( the real part of the inner product ) , a symplectic structure ( the imaginary part of the inner product ) and a connecting ( 1 - 1)-tensor , the complex structure @xmath0 satisfying @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand in classical mechanics the prevailing structure is provided by the symplectic structure , it is therefore a natural question to ask what happens , in the appropriate limit as suggested by dirac , of both the complex and riemannian structures .    of course a similar question can be asked with respect to the linear structure . here",
    ", however , the situation is more involved because , due to the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics , one requires that only the probability density is physically meaningful and not the probability amplitude , this means that from the measurement view point , the carrier space of quantum mechanics is the complex projective space associated with @xmath2 rather than @xmath3 itself . on this manifold",
    "there is still a khler structure @xcite but the linear structure has disappeared , showing that it is not the linear structure which matters but rather a superposition ( composition rule ) for solutions , allowing to construct new solutions out of two given ones , as it is well known this phenomenon is well understood in the framework of riccati - type equations and we will not insist any further on the subject , we refer to the existing literature @xcite on the argument .    as for quantum mechanics ,",
    "there has been a recent proposal to define a superposition rule on pure states @xcite ( the complex projective space of @xmath3 ) which amounts to the introduction of a connection on the complex projective space .",
    "this connection is essentially given by the pancharatnam phase , which is also known in the literature as the berry phase or geometric phase.@xcite    apart from the details concerning the linear structure or the superposition principle of quantum mechanics , the khler structure is always present and it is a challenge to understand what happens of the complex structure when the appropriate limit to go from quantum to classical is taken . because we want to consider the fate of the complex structure in the quantum - classical transition , it is more appropriate to deal directly with a real vector space and a complex structure @xmath0 defined on it , rather than consider the hilbert space and hide the complex structure in the defining properties of the space itself .    before entering our discussion",
    "we should point out that the role played by the complex structure in quantum mechanics was already considered by h. reichenbach in his book  _ philosophic foundations of quantum mechanics  _",
    ".@xcite it was also extensively considered by stueckelberg and his collaborators.@xcite afterwards we find comments by g.w .",
    "mackey @xcite and a more extensive treatment by v. cantoni .",
    "a decade ago a new analysis started @xcite also in connection with a proposal by s. weinberg @xcite on a non - linear quantum mechanics .",
    "in referring to previous papers we have not distinguished between papers actually focused on the role of the complex structure and those dealing with the role of the riemannian structure , the reason being that for us the symplectic structure is not questioned because ( as a structure ) it survives the  appropriate limit  to classical mechanics .",
    "therefore , with a symplectic structure granted , the complex structure and the riemannian structure are not independent and each one determines the other one .",
    "because we are mostly interested in the classical limit , we are obliged to take into account various pictures of quantum mechanics to consider the classical limit separately for each one of them .",
    "traditionally , one considers the schroedinger picture and the heisenberg picture , in which the equations of motion are considered on the space of states or on the algebra of observables respectively .",
    "here we would like to replace the heisenberg picture with what we may call the ehrenfest picture , that is we deal with quadratic functions , expectations values , rather than with operators .",
    "in this section we discuss in a slightly generalized form the quoted argument of stueckelberg which shows the necessity of introducing a complex structure @xmath0 to get indetermination relations and formulate quantum mechanics .",
    "therefore we start with a real hilbert space .",
    "an indetermination relation _  la _ heisenberg usually is a relation like @xmath4\\right\\rangle _ { \\psi } ^{2}\\ ] ] where the error operators of the _ observables _ @xmath5 and @xmath6@xmath7 are related to their commutator through the hermitian operator @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "however , on a _ real _ hilbert space , the multiplication by the imaginary unit @xmath9 in @xmath8 $ ] does not make sense .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 $ ] is a skew - hermitian operator , so that its mean value with respect to a _ real _ scalar product always vanishes .    then , motivated by scaling arguments , in principle there are two possibilities : @xmath11^{2}\\right\\rangle _ { \\psi } \\\\",
    "\\mu ^{2}\\left\\langle k(a , b)\\right\\rangle _ { \\psi } ^{2 } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a real number and @xmath13 a hermitian bilinear expression to be determined .",
    "the first possibility leads to a contradiction for bounded operators unless @xmath14    in fact , choosing @xmath15 in an orthonormal basis \\{@xmath16 } in which @xmath5 is diagonal : @xmath17 and @xmath18 is bounded if @xmath6 is bounded , so their product vanishes while on the contrary @xmath19^{2}\\right\\rangle _ { \\psi } = \\sum\\nolimits_{n}(a_{\\psi } -a_{n})^{2}\\left\\langle \\psi |b|\\phi _ { n}\\right\\rangle ^{2}$ ] is strictly positive .",
    "only the existence of a complex structure @xmath0 leads to an indetermination relation :    an indetermination relation ( inequality ) holds on a real hilbert space for hermitian operators @xmath5,@xmath6 ( observables ) commuting with a complex structure @xmath0 .",
    "it has the form :    @xmath20\\right\\rangle _ { \\psi } ^{2}\\ ] ]    the following is a detailed proof which shows that a generalization is possible .",
    "consider the following real scalar product : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a real number and @xmath23 is an operator which has to be determined in such a way that an indetermination relation holds .",
    "expanding the preceding expression leads to @xmath24 therefore the condition is obtained : @xmath25 the expression is positive for every value of @xmath22 when : @xmath26 where @xmath27 if a complex structure @xmath0 is available , we may choose @xmath28 and look for the maximum of @xmath29    we have @xmath30_{+}\\right\\rangle _ { \\psi } \\cos \\theta + \\left\\langle j[a , b]\\right\\rangle _ { \\psi } \\sin \\theta = : \\alpha \\cos \\theta + \\beta \\sin \\theta\\ ] ] then @xmath31 so that eventually @xmath32_{+}\\right\\rangle _ { \\psi } ^{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\left\\langle j[a , b]\\right\\rangle _ { \\psi } ^{2}\\ ] ] this general form of the indetermination relation , first discovered by schroedinger @xcite and robertson @xcite in the 30 s , reduces to the weaker heisenberg relation for uncorrelated states ( see also @xcite ) .    * remark * the same expression for the indetermination relation holds also on the _ complexified _ ( _ via _",
    "@xmath0 ) hilbert space .",
    "before we have discussed the need of a complex structure @xmath0 in quantum mechanics . in this section we discuss the relevant geometric structures which appear in quantum mechanics and the relations among them .",
    "to avoid technicalities , for the time being , while we deal with general aspects , we shall confine ourselves to finite dimensional carrier spaces ; later , to consider the transition to classical mechanics , we will deal with operators acting on infinite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "we consider a vector space @xmath33 equipped with a complex structure @xmath0 , that is a ( 1 - 1)-tensor with the property @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath33 is a vector space its linear structure determines -and is determined by- a vector field @xmath34 , the infinitesimal generator of dilation ( often it is also called the liouville vector field or the euler operator ) .",

    ".    the admissibility condition of @xmath41 and @xmath0 is stated @xcite by requiring that @xmath45 @xmath46 i.e. @xmath0 is an orthogonal transformation both at the finite level ( eq.([finj ] ) ) and at the infinitesimal level ( eq.([infinj ] ) ) .    out of @xmath41 and @xmath0",

    "quite similarly @xcite , if the relation of eq.([admj ] ) does not define a complex structure @xmath0 , that is if @xmath67 , then riesz s theorem tells us that there exists a nonsingular linear operator @xmath5 such that : @xmath68 and the antisymmetry of @xmath47 implies : @xmath69 i.e. that @xmath5 is skew - hermitian : @xmath70 , and : @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath89 only if the metric is standard euclidean one and , in general , symmetric matrices need not be self - adjoint .    to completely turn entities depending on the linear structure on the space of states into tensorial objects ,",
    "we notice that with every matrix @xmath90 we can associate both a @xmath91tensor @xmath92 and a linear vector field @xmath93 the two are connected by @xmath94 and are both homogeneous of degree zero , i.e. @xmath95    the correspondence @xmath96 is a full associative algebra and a corresponding lie algebra isomorphism .",
    "the correspondence @xmath97 is instead only a lie algebra ( anti)isomorphism , that is @xmath98 while @xmath99=-x_{[a , b]}.\\ ] ] moreover , for any @xmath100 : @xmath101}.\\ ] ] out of the liouville vector field @xmath34 and the metric tensor @xmath41 , we can construct the quadratic function @xmath102 along with the associated hamiltonian vector field @xmath103 via the @xmath104 it is possible to show that @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "the vector field @xmath103 preserves all three structures @xmath107 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus the vector field @xmath103 will be a generator of the unitary group and may be associated with a schroedinger - type equation @xmath108 where we have used the more familiar notation @xmath109 instead of @xmath110 .",
    "more generally , starting from eqs.([met ] ) , ( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ jdelta ] ) , we can construct quadratic functions associated with any linear vector field @xmath111 by defining @xmath112 then again we have @xmath113 where now @xmath114 whenever the matrix @xmath5 satisfies the condition of the following eq.([omegaa+aomega ] ) .",
    "in general , any vector field @xmath111 will define the equations of motion of a quantum systems if @xmath115 and , _ _ a fortiori ,  _ _ @xmath116 .",
    "this implies that the matrix @xmath5 , representative of the vector field , satisfies the relations @xmath117 while the condition @xmath118 implies that @xmath119 where , with abuse of notation , we have used @xmath47 and @xmath41 to represent a matrix associated with the corresponding tensors .    by using the vector fields @xmath34 and @xmath120 , which are an involutive distribution , i.e. in particular they commute , we get out of @xmath121 the complex projective space associated with the hilbert space structure on @xmath33 defined by the hermitian form @xmath122 ( see eq.([innerprod ] ) ) , which will be denoted by @xmath123 .    by construction ,",
    "the unitary group acting on @xmath33 in terms of linear transformation will induce an action on @xmath123 which turns out to be a transitive action .",
    "the first outcome of our description in terms of tensors is that now instead of linear operators on @xmath123 we can use vector fields on @xmath123 which are autonomously defined without making recourse to the underlined vector space @xmath124 the main point here is that @xmath123  is not a linear space therefore it makes no sense to consider on it linear operators , one has to induce an action from linear operators acting on @xmath33 .",
    "the use of vector fields allows to bypass the construction of the action in terms of @xmath125",
    "we have remarked that the linear action of the unitary group on @xmath33 is provided by the intersection of the symplectic group and the rotation group .",
    "because the group acts symplectically , there will be an associated momentum map from the vector space to the dual of the lie algebra , say @xmath126 in explicit terms we have @xmath127 where we have used the bra and ket notation of dirac , and identified @xmath128 with @xmath129 through a trace operation . by using our previous structures , it would be @xmath130 which acts on @xmath129  in the following way : @xmath131 for any @xmath132    to have a momentum map equivariant with respect to the action of @xmath34 and @xmath120  we may set @xmath133 or @xmath134 this map represents the momentum map associated with the symplectic action of @xmath135 on the complex projective space @xmath136    it is now clear that all vector fields associated with hermitian operators on @xmath33 will pass to the quotient @xmath123 because they commute with @xmath137 and preserve @xmath0 .    with any hermitian operator @xmath5 we associate @xmath111 which projects onto @xmath138 , giving a symplectic vector field with generating function @xmath139 that is @xmath140",
    "we observe that functions here defined may be expressed through the quadratic functions defined by eq.([quad ] ) of the previous section : they are nothing but the quadratic functions projected onto @xmath123@xmath141 it is now possible to formulate the equations of motion in terms of this  mean values  of the hermitian operators .",
    "the ehrenfest picture @xcite of quantum mechanics originates from the ehrenfest theorem",
    ". we may formulate it within our approach in the following way .",
    "we consider the lie algebra of the unitary group realized in terms of skew - hermitian operators on @xmath33 and we define a map @xmath142 this evaluation map has the property that @xmath143 coincides with the momentum map associated with the symplectic action of the unitary group acting on @xmath124    our aim now is to realize the algebra of linear operators on @xmath33 in the ehrenfest picture , that is by means of quadratic functions .",
    "we observe that the definition of eq.([quad ] ) in sec.(3)is not suitable to this end , because the real scalar product @xmath41 annihilates the skew - symmetric part of any operator @xmath144 therefore , we have to use the hermitian form @xmath122 defined by eq.([innerprod ] ) of sec.(3 ) and deal with complex - valued functions of real variables : @xmath145 this definition reduces to the previous one and yields real functions for hermitian operators , while associates imaginary functions to skew - hermitian operators , so that it realizes a one to one correspondence between operators and complex - valued quadratic functions .",
    "we notice that neither @xmath41 nor @xmath146 separately can be used to recover the full associative algebra : in fact @xmath47 allows to recover the lie algebra structure of the hermitian operators , but it is not able to recover the symmetrized product on hermitian operators , i.e. the jordan algebra structure @xcite existing on the space of hermitian operators . to recover this product we have to use the metric tensor @xmath41 .",
    "it is only the use of the entire admissible triple @xmath147 or the equivalent hermitian structure @xmath122 that allows to give a complete description of the full algebra of operators in the ehrenfest scheme .",
    "we now introduce two brackets on quadratic functions corresponding respectively to lie and jordan operator algebras and from them recover the associative operator product.@xcite in fact , it is well known that on the symplectic vector space @xmath148 we can define a poisson tensor @xmath149 which is the  inverse  of @xmath150 : in coordinates we have @xmath151 with @xmath152 .",
    "the associated poisson bracket is given by @xmath153 on quadratic functions we have the following result : @xmath154}(x)=-if_{[a , b]}(x)\\ .\\ ] ]    in fact , supposing @xmath155 hermitian operators , in coordinates @xmath156 then , bearing in mind that @xmath157 we have : @xmath158 @xmath159 @xmath160x , x)=-\\frac{i}{2}h([a , b]x , x)=-if_{[a , b]}(x).\\ ] ] moreover    @xmath161}(x)\\ = \\frac{1}{2}h([a , b]x , x)=\\frac{i}{2}\\omega ( [ a , b]x , x)=\\frac{i}{2}g(j[a , b]x , x)=if_{j[a , b]}(x)\\ ] ]    the proof is analogous in the cases when one or both operators  @xmath5 and @xmath6 are skew - symmetric , due to the relation @xmath162 .    by using in a similar way the inverse of the metric tensor @xmath163 say @xmath164 with @xmath165 , we may define a new bracket ( we shall call it the riemann - jordan bracket ) on functions as : @xmath166 by using quadratic functions we get the relation @xmath167    in fact , assuming again @xmath168 hermitian operators , and bearing in mind that @xmath169 , we have in coordinates @xmath170 @xmath171_{+}x , x)=\\ ] ] @xmath172_{+}x , x)=f_{(ab+ba)}(x).\\ ] ]    finally , we introduce an associative product on quadratic functions as @xmath173 so that @xmath174 and @xmath175 so we obtain the following result : @xmath176 which is the analog of the operator decomposition @xmath177_{+}+% \\frac{1}{2}[a , b]$ ] .",
    "it is also apparent that the following relation which connects gradient and hamiltonian fields holds ( see eq.([grad - ham ] ) of sec.(3 ) ) : @xmath178    equations of motion in this picture have the classical - like form @xmath179 within the one - to - one correspondence between operators and quadratic functions , we recover the heisenberg equations of motion in hamiltonian form .",
    "we conclude this section by observing that the @xmath180 product is reminiscent of the weyl - wigner approach and the moyal bracket .",
    "it shows also that a full isomorphism of algebras between quadratic functions and operators requires the introduction of a non - local product .",
    "summarizing , we have replaced the initial description provided by dirac in terms of hilbert spaces and operators acting on them with a description on the differentiable manifold of pure states ( the complex projective space ) in terms of vector fields and functions .",
    "it is clear that if we do not have a linear structure we have no meaning of quadratic functions , therefore the  image  of quadratic functions on @xmath33 shall be identified autonomously .",
    "this identification is achieved by requiring that hamiltonian vector fields associated with them should be killing vectors with respect to the metric structure on @xmath123 arising from the khler structure .",
    "this ends up being the infinitesimal version of wigner s",
    "to consider the quantum - classical transition , the best way is to consider a description which uses the same carries space for both classical and quantum descriptions , i.e. smooth functions on the phase space .",
    "the classical picture uses the point - wise product , while the quantum picture uses the @xmath181product .",
    "in particular we shall restrict to a phase - space which is a symplectic vector space and the @xmath182-product is the moyal product .    given a symplectic vector space @xmath183 , a weyl system is defined to be a strongly continuous map from @xmath184 to unitary transformations on some hilbert space @xmath3 : @xmath185 with @xmath186 with @xmath187 the identity operator .",

    "this  appropriate classical limit  shows very clearly that while in quantum mechanics the associative and non commutative product among functions determines all the various structures , i.e. the complex structure and the poisson bracket , because the lie product and therefore the jordan product are uniquely determined by the operator - product @xcite , in the classical picture the point - wise product does not fix a unique  compatible poisson bracket  .",
    "indeed all possible poisson tensors on phase space define derivations for the point - wise product on functions on the phase space .    to exhibit more clearly this aspect , i.e. the role of the symmetric tensor in the definition of the @xmath180product we use a slightly modified product with respect to the one given by moyal .",

    ", the product gives rise to a point - wise product which does not privilege any specific poisson bracket .",
    "however , a poisson bracket may be selected by considering the classical limit of the lie product . a similar classical limit for the jordan product would anyway start with the point - wise term and therefore would not give rise naturally to a symmetric tensor on phase - space .",
    "our argument has been presented without privileging any dynamical system .",
    "it is however true that if we consider special systems like the harmonic oscillator , by considering the limit of operators realized in terms of creation and annihilation operators , we would get a classical phase - space described in terms of complex coordinates .",
    "however , these would not exist for generic hamiltonian systems .      here",
    "the the classical limit would require first that the operators are realized as differential operators on some `` configuration space '' , acting on square integrable functions defined on the same configuration space .",
    "the classical limit would correspond to the replacement of the differential operators with their symbols @xcite and the complex structure would appear only at the level of the so called `` quantum potential '' having @xmath252 as coefficient . moreover , out of the coupled equations for the real and the imaginary part of the wave function , we would obtain only one equation ( for @xmath253 ) represented by the hamilton - jacobi equation . a complete solution for this equation would allow for the construction of a solution for the other one ( the transport equation).@xcite                    e.c.g .",
