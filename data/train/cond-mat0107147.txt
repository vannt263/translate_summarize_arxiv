    "a molecular wire in its simplest definition is a single molecule that forms an electrically conducting bridge between a pair of metallic contacts . during the last few years molecular wires",
    "have been realized in the laboratory and the electric current that flows through an individual molecule in response to a potential bias applied between the contacts has been measured@xcite .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics of molecular wires are sensitive to the electronic structure of the molecule and contacts , which depends on the spatial arrangement ( conformation ) of the atoms that make up the wire and the distribution of electronic charge along the wire : molecular wires have been observed to switch between conducting and non - conducting states due to a voltage - induced redox reaction , i.e. , a change of the charge distribution in the wire@xcite , and also in response to bias - driven conformational changes@xcite .",
    "these experiments indicate that transport non - linearities , conformational changes and charging in molecular wires are mutually interdependent phenomena , each of which can strongly influence the others , and that they should therefore be treated theoretically in a unified way",
    ". theoretical work to date has studied some of these phenomena independently @xcite but there has been little work directed at bringing all three of them together within a single theoretical framework .    in this article",
    "we introduce a tractable theoretical approach that unifies the three phenomena and present the results of self - consistent calculations for the simplest molecular wires , namely , small chain molecules bonded to metal electrodes",
    ". _ at low bias _",
    "these molecular wires are conductors or insulators depending on which atoms make up the chain molecule and electrodes and on the number of atoms in the chain .",
    "remarkably , we find that the _ non - linear _ transport characteristics of these apparently dissimilar systems are strikingly similar and can be understood in terms of a single physical picture : we find that in the non - linear transport regime the molecular wire acquires excess electronic charge .",
    "this charge resides in a molecular orbital which , being _ partly _ occupied , lies at the fermi level and therefore controls electron transport through the molecule .",
    "( if there is no molecular orbital near the fermi level at zero bias , we find that the conformation of the molecule changes at finite bias in such a way that a suitable orbital appears there ) . as the bias increases , the partly occupied orbital acquires more charge and the electrostatic contribution to its energy rises together with the electro - chemical potential of the source electrode . when this orbital rises well above the electro - chemical potential of the drain electrode the electron flux that it transmits _ from drain to source _ approaches zero and ceases to decline with increasing bias while the flux that it transmits from source to drain can not increase further significantly .",
    "thus the net current through the molecular wire saturates . at the same time a charge density wave grows along the wire and atomic displacements occur , lengthening and thus weakening certain molecular bonds .",
    "we find the bond weakening to be sufficient that after saturating the current carried by the wire _ decreases _ as the bias increases further .",
    "we predict this novel negative differential resistance phenomenon to be a _",
    "generic _ property of molecular wires that involve chain molecules .",
    "ii presents the theoretical formulation of the model that includes charge transfer and conformational change in the non - linear transport regime .",
    "the transport characteristics of two simple linear chain - like molecules ( homogeneous and inhomogeneous ) are presented in sec .",
    "iii based on calculations using the model of sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv summarizes the results of this work .",
    "recent theories of electronic transport in molecular wires have been based on semi - empirical tight - binding models ( such as the extended hckel model ) and on _ ab - initio _ computations that are founded on density functional theory . for standard values of the tight binding model parameters adopted from the quantum chemistry literature ,",
    "the tight binding models have yielded results that are similar to ( and often in semi - quantitative agreement with ) those obtained from the _ ab - initio _ computations .",
    "for example , tight binding calculations@xcite have yielded current - voltage characteristics for the benzene - dithiolate molecule bonded between gold nano - contacts that are similar to those that have been found in _ ab - initio _ calculations@xcite .",
    "these studies@xcite have made it evident that the differences between the results of the tight - binding and _ ab - initio _ calculations for this system are less significant than the uncertainties that are due to the present limited understanding of the conformational aspects of bonding between the molecule and metal contacts .",
    "tight binding calculations of electronic transport through molecular wires consisting of chains of carbon atoms connecting metal contacts have also yielded results@xcite that that agree remarkably well with those found in _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations for the same systems@xcite .",
    "the _ ab - initio _ calculations have the advantage of not relying on the use of empirical parameters .",
    "however they are much more computationally intensive than tight - binding calculations .",
    "therefore they are limited in their application to smaller molecular systems and rely on the use of the jellium approximation to treat the metallic contacts .",
    "for the same reason it is difficult to study conformational changes using the _ ab - initio _ techniques and the molecules were assumed to be rigid in the above _ ab - initio _",
    "studies.@xcite since the _ ab - initio _ calculations are based on density functional theory which is known to be rigorously valid only for ground state properties , their validity for transport calculations far from equilibrium is uncertain _ a priori_. furthermore even in calculations of ground state properties they rely in practice on the use of the local density approximation .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect them to be more reliable than calculations based on simpler mean field theories such as the hartree - fock approximation . while the keldysh technique can in principle provide a more rigorous approach to the problem of transport far from equilibrium , its practical application to real molecular wires still presents major challenges at this time .",
    "a shortcoming of the tight - binding approach to molecular wire transport has been that it has not provided a way to calculate the conformational changes that occur in a molecular wire when an electric current is driven through it , or to treat the influence of these conformational changes and of charging of the molecule on the current in a consistent way , within the same theoretical framework .",
    "the formalism that we present below accomplishes this , however it should be emphasized that it , like the _ ab - initio _ calculations mentioned above , is based on density functional theory and should therefore also be regarded as a practical mean field approach to the difficult many - body problem of transport in molecular wires far from equilibrium , and not as a rigorous treatment of this problem .    in our tight - binding formalism",

    "these states are partly transmitted through the wire giving rise to the current @xmath31 and partly reflected .",
    "we adopt the same physical picture in calculating the _ actual _ conformation that the molecular wire takes in the presence of the applied bias and transmitted current : we assume that the asymptotic regions of the contacts constitute ideal leads where the electrons may be treated as non - interacting .",
    "we also assume that the filling of electron states _ that are incident on the wire _ from each contact",
    "is described completely by the fermi function of that contact , i.e. , it depends only on the applied bias and the temperature and not on the conformation of the wire .",

    "equation ( [ electronic ] ) is the non - equilibrium tight - binding analog of equation ( 2.10 ) of kohn and sham@xcite : the integrand in equation ( [ electronic ] ) corresponds to the sum of the energy eigenvalues of the occupied kohn - sham effective single - particle states .",
    "these single particle states correspond to electrons that arrive at the molecular wire from the source and drain leads and are populated according to the fermi distributions of the source and drain leads respectively .",
    "the first summation corrects for the double counting of the coulomb energy due to interactions between electrons that is implicit in the integral that precedes it .",
    "the second summation corrects the contribution of the on - site energy to the total electronic energy .",
    "@xmath42 includes implicitly the interaction energy between the nuclei and the electrons of the wire but omits the electrostatic energy of the nuclei of charge @xmath47 interacting with each other and with the potential @xmath8 due to the applied bias and image charges in the contacts .",

    "we calculate the current - voltage characteristics of 6 and 7 atom inhomogeneous and homogeneous chains , allowing the atoms to relax both in the presence and absence of a bias voltage .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the calculated site charges @xmath68 are shown for bias voltages of 0 , 1 and 2v .",
    "for the homogeneous chains ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , b ) each atom is neutral at 0v . at higher bias , a charge density wave ( cdw ) forms in both the 6 and 7 atom chains .",
    "the cdw arises from a superposition of standing electron waves@xcite in the wire .",
    "the relaxed atomic positions are the lateral positions of the symbols in each graph .",
    "the vertical lines show the relaxed positions at 0v ; the unrelaxed positions match the ticks on the z axis . at 0v",
    "the 6 atom chain dimerizes while the 7 atom chain has a frustrated dimerization pattern . at higher",
    "v , the weakening of some bonds amplifies the standing waves and cdw s .",
    "the inhomogeneous chains ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , d ) show similar features although the cdw s are present even at 0v and there is a net transfer of charge from the metal contacts to these wires .",
    "the atoms at the ends of the chains in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , d are metal electrode atoms . these metal atoms are positively charged as charge is transferred from them to the chain . for the 6 atom chain , this charge transfer at the ends of the chain frustrates the cdw , and a charged soliton forms . at 0",
    "v the soliton is at the center of the chain .",
    "it moves away from the more negatively charged end of the chain at larger bias .",
    "the soliton is associated with a stretched bond . for both inhomogeneous chains ,",
    "there is considerable weakening of the bond between the chain and drain at higher bias .",
    "this will be seen to have an important effect on the current flowing through the wire .",
    "these charging and conformational changes are intimately linked to the transport of electrons through the wires .",
    "the voltage - dependent transmission probabilities for 0 , 1 and 2v are shown in fig .",
    "consider first the case of zero bias and odd atom chains ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , d ) . in isolation",
    "these chains have an odd number of valence electrons ( in this case 7 ) which occupy molecular orbitals , the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) being half - filled . in an open system",
    "if this orbital were well below @xmath37 it would have to be completely filled and if it were well above the @xmath37 it would be completely empty .",
    "both situations lead to unfavorable charging of the wire .",
    "thus the homo must be _ at _ @xmath37 and transmission resonances due to the homo can be seen at @xmath50  ev in the two graphs .",
    "( the homo of the inhomogeneous wire is more than half full due to charge transfer from the contacts .",
    "thus the center of the 0v homo resonance in fig .",
    "[ fig3]d is slightly below @xmath37 ) . the 6 atom inhomogeneous chain also has a resonance near @xmath37 at zero bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) . this can be explained similarly because there is charge transfer which must go to a partly filled state near @xmath37 .",
    "this partly filled state leads to the charged soliton in fig .",
    "however , the 6 atom homogeneous chain has no resonance at @xmath37 at 0v ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) since there is no unpaired electron and no charge transfer at zero bias .",
    "indeed it is energetically favorable for this chain to dimerize at 0v pushing its homo lower in energy and widening the gap around @xmath37 .",
    "this explains why there are resonances at @xmath37 at zero bias for some of the systems but not for others .",
    "charge transfer also explains why there are resonances at @xmath37 for _ all _ of the chains at non - zero bias : all of the wires become partly charged at non - zero bias .",
    "thus all of them must have a partly filled level at non - zero bias and this level must be near @xmath37 . for the 6 atom homogeneous chain ,",
    "a significant rearrangement of its atomic positions is required to generate this state near @xmath37 .",
    "( the appearance of fewer resonances than atoms in the chain in some plots is due to degeneracy of some of the transmitting states ) .",
    "the current vs. voltage characteristics calculated from these transmission probabilities are shown in fig .",
    "their physical meaning is as follows : at moderate and high bias the resonance near @xmath37 carries the net current through the wire .",
    "as the bias increases the wire becomes charged and the coulomb potential due to that charge raises the energy of the resonant state until the bottom edge of the resonance is above the electro - chemical potential of the drain . before this occurs the resonance transmits electrons coming from _ both _ the source and drain . as the bias increases there are fewer electrons from the drain and more from the source going through the resonance",
    "so the current is growing .",
    "eventually there are no electrons from the drain going through the resonance and the current saturates",
    ". it then declines and negative differential resistance sets in because the stretching and weakening of bonds inhibits electron transmission through the wire .",
    "in summary , we have presented theoretical work that for the first time unifies non - linear transport , charging and conformational change in molecular wires .",
    "we have shown that the effects of charging and conformational change can be understood _ together _ in terms of a remarkably robust physical mechanism of non - linear transport and predict negative differential resistance at high bias .",
    "one class of molecular wires that we have modeled ( the homogeneous wires ) is representative of chains of metal atoms connecting metallic contacts such as have recently been realized in the laboratory for the case of gold.@xcite experiments carried out to determine whether these systems exhibit negative differential resistance at high bias would be of interest .      m.  a.  reed , c.  zhou , c.  j.  muller , t.  p.  burgin , and j.  m.  tour , science * 278 * , 252 ( 1997 )",
