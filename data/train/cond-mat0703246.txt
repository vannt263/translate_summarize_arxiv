    "<S> we show that quasi - bound electron states are formed in a quantum wire as a result of electron backscattering in the transition regions between the wire and the electron reservoirs , to which the wire is coupled . </S>",
    "<S> the backscattering mechanism is caused by electron density oscillations arising even in smooth transitions due to the reflection of electrons not transmitting through the wire . </S>",
    "<S> the quasi - bound states reveal themselves in resonances of the electron transmission probability through the wire . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were carried out within the hartree - fock approximation using quasiclassic wavefunctions .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) and quantum wires ( qws ) have attracted much interest as model systems for studying effects of an electron - electron interaction in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance of these devices is known  @xcite to be quantized according to a universal law , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , which was successfully explained within the model of noninteracting electrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent experiments have revealed a lot of other features of the conductance which are yet unexplained . </S>",
    "<S> widely discussed is the 0.7  anomaly  @xcite . besides , such observations as strongly nonlinear conductance at low applied voltage  @xcite , additional plateaulike features  @xcite and even resonances in the differential conductance  @xcite are also of interest . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that these features are caused by the electron - electron interaction , but only electron - electron interaction in the 1d system fails to explain them . of no less importance </S>",
    "<S> is the fact that a 1d wire is coupled to 2d electron reservoirs and hence there are transition regions between the 1d qw and the 2d reservoirs ( 1d-2d junctions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most puzzling result found recently is the electron localization in the qpc , which was first brought to light from the studies of the 0.7 plateaulike feature in short qws . </S>",
    "<S> cronenwett  _ et al _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite related this feature to the kondo effect caused by the electron spin localization in the qw . </S>",
    "<S> the most convincing evidence of the electron localization was provided by the momentum - resolved tunnelling experiments of auslaender  _ et al _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> peaks and kinks in conductance dependences on the gate voltage observed on the devices with high electron mobility  @xcite implicitly also points to the presence of quasi - bound electron states . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is that in all the experiments the electrons are localized over the barrier formed by the electrodes , the potential of which varies smoothly on the electron wavelength scale . </S>",
    "<S> the localization mechanism remains unclear , but it is widely believed that the existence of the quasi - bound states in the qw allows one to interpret the plateualike features and the resonances of the conductance . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the quasi - bound states were related to local broadening of the qw and formation of a potential well . to justify the formation of the quasi - bound states , hirose  _ et al _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite calculated electron density distribution in qpcs with geometric lengths of the order of the fermi wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> however in the experiments the geometric sizes exceed the fermi wavelength noticeably , the barrier induced by the gates is rather smooth and the over - barrier reflection is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> recently , rejec and meir  @xcite have demonstrated the presence of quasi - bound states in the qpc by calculations based on spin - density functional theory , but the underlying physical mechanism remains unknown .    </S>",
    "<S> such a mechanism was suggested in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the localization is a result of an intersubband electron interaction in the 1d-2d transition regions . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is caused by the friedel oscillations of the density of higher subband electrons , which do not pass through the transition regions , and are reflected . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons of an open subband are backscattered by these oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> since the backscattering occurs in two opposed sides of the qw , quasi - bound states are formed . </S>",
    "<S> when studying the backscattering in 1d-2d junctions the problem is the complicated structure of the electron density distribution along the qw . besides a smooth component of the electron density there is an oscillating one , and it is just this component that gives rise to the electron backscattering . an analytic theory of scattering by the friedel oscillations in the outside of the junction ( the far zone ) , where the wave vector of the oscillations is close to @xmath2 and the electrons with the fermi energy are resonantly scattered , was developed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but the scattering by nonperiodic oscillations of the electron density inside the transition region ( the near zone ) may be also important , because the oscillation amplitude is larger there . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> the electron backscattering in the smooth 1d-2d junctions is studied within the hartree - fock approximation taking into account both near and far zones . </S>",
    "<S> the backscattering in the near zone turns out to contribute essentially to the total effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that quasi - bound states are formed in the qw giving rise to the transmission resonances .     of the first ( 1 ) and higher ( 2,3 ) subband bottoms ; dashed lines  </S>",
    "<S> transverse quantization energies of the first ( 1 ) and higher subbands.,width=10 ]    consider a qw in the form of a strip connecting 2d electron reservoirs with a given electrochemical potential @xmath3 . the strip width , @xmath4 , varies as follows : @xmath5 , & |x|>a \\ , , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where the broadening radius @xmath6 considerably exceeds both @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the fermi wave vector in reservoirs ) . for simplicity , we assume that only the first subband is open . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons in the higher subbands are reflected in the 1d-2d junctions .    </S>",
    "<S> the backscattering of electrons incident on the qw is calculated in a way similar to that of @xcite with two essential additions which are required to include the scattering process in the near zone . </S>",
    "<S> first , in addition to the friedel oscillations produced by closed subbands we take into account the electron density oscillations produced by the first subband electrons with energy below the potential landscape maximum in the qw , @xmath10 , ( figure  [ d_rho_u](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons are reflected from the barrier giving rise to electron density oscillations with the wave vector @xmath11 , which is close to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , these oscillations can noticeably contribute to the backscattering of the electrons passing through the qw . </S>",
    "<S> the second addition is the selfconsistent calculation of the smooth components of the potential and the electron density distribution in the qw . </S>",
    "<S> the potential landscape along the qw axis is formed by the transverse quantization energy and the smooth component of the hartree potential . </S>",
    "<S> this is important because in the near zone the potential landscape considerably differs from the transverse quantization energy , as figure  [ d_rho_u](c ) shows .    the calculations are carried out in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> first , one - particle wave functions are written in the adiabatic approximation as a product of transverse and longitudinal wave functions @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the subband number , @xmath14 is a transverse wavefunction corresponding to transverse quantization energy @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> second , effectively 1d equations are obtained for the longitudinal wave functions @xmath16 by averaging the hartee - fock equations over transverse coordinates with the weight @xmath17 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> one obtains 1d schrdinger equations with effective 1d hartree and exchange terms . </S>",
    "<S> third , these equations are solved selfconsistently using perturbation theory . to zero order in the interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions are written in the quasi - classic approximation . at this stage </S>",
    "<S> the problem is solved numerically using the iteration procedure developed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron scattering is calculated in the first bohrn approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the quasi - classic approximation is justified if the local wavelength of an electron on the fermi level is smaller than the characteristic spatial scale of the potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic approximation and its application to similar structures were considered in detail by glazman et al  @xcite    thus , zero - order wave functions for the closed states are @xmath18\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the wave vector of the longitudinal motion , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a turning point . for electrons of the first subband with energy higher than the potential landscape maximum </S>",

    "<S> the transmission resonances correspond to third and fourth states.,width=453 ]    the electron density in each subband , having been found using equations ( [ c_band ] ) and ( [ o_band ] ) , depends on the electrochemical potential in the reservoirs @xmath3 and the effective potential @xmath30 in the device . </S>",
    "<S> the density is a sum of two components : one is oscillating and the other varies smoothly on the electron wavelength scale . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the potential acting on the electrons also has two similar components . </S>",
    "<S> a smooth component of the potential is calculated selfconsistently with the electron density using the technique developed in @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the potential profile @xmath30 ( see fig.[d_rho_u ] ) is obtained for each subband and used to calculate the wave vectors @xmath19 in equations ( [ c_band ] ) and ( [ o_band ] ) , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> a rapidly oscillating component of the potential is considered as a perturbation , which scatters an electron from a state @xmath32 to @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering potential contains the hartree and exchange components : @xmath34  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hartree potential acting on the first subband electrons is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the electron density in the _ </S>",
    "<S> _ l__th subband , @xmath37 is the background charge density and @xmath38 the exchange interaction is described by an operator , which has following form for the first subband electrons @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the density matrix and @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the pair interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> the screening of the coulomb interaction is taken into account similarly to @xcite , assuming that the screening is produced by a conducting plane ( gate ) situated over the device at a distance @xmath43 or / and by the reservoirs , deep inside which the potential is fixed . in specific calculations </S>",
    "<S> the potential is taken to be constant at a distance @xmath44 from the center of the qw . the reflection amplitude for electrons in the open subband ( i.e.,for the @xmath45 transition ) </S>",
    "<S> is calculated in the born approximation @xmath46    . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters used are @xmath47 nm ; @xmath48 nm ; @xmath49 @xmath50 m ; @xmath51 mev.,width=453 ]    the main results obtained are shown in figures  [ reflect_size],[reflect_screen],[reflect_ef ] where the reflection coefficient @xmath52 of the electrons incident on the qw is shown as a function of the electron energy measured from the potential landscape maximum for a variety of the device parameters . </S>",
    "<S> one sees the resonant behavior of the electron reflection . at some energies the reflectance strongly diminishes and correspondingly the transmission resonantly increases . </S>",
    "<S> calculations show that the resonance energies are mainly determined by the geometric sizes of the device : the length of the uniform part @xmath26 and the broadening radius @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in figure  [ reflect_size ] . </S>",
    "<S> the screening effect on the reflectance is demonstrated by figure  [ reflect_screen ] where the reflectance spectra are shown for a variety of the distances @xmath43 between the qw and the screening electrode . </S>",
    "<S> this distance affects both the width of the transmission resonances ( the width of the resonance decreases with @xmath43 ) and the reflection coefficient at energies between the resonances ( @xmath52 increases with @xmath43 ) , the resonance energies being weakly dependent on @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the fermi level in the reservoirs weakly affects the position of the resonance , while @xmath52 is affected noticeably(figure  [ reflect_ef ] ) .     in reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters used are @xmath47 nm ; @xmath48 nm ; @xmath49 @xmath50 m ; screening gate is absent.,width=12 ]    the reflection resonances clearly point to the presence of quasi - bound states located in the region of the potential landscape maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the quasi - bound states and the energy dependence of the backscattering may be described rather well by a simple model . </S>",
    "<S> the electron scattering in 1d-2d junctions may be imagined as scattering by two @xmath53-like barriers located symmetrically at a distance @xmath54 from the qw center . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering potential is @xmath55 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 and @xmath56 are fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the wave vector @xmath57 , for which the backscattering vanishes , is defined by the equation @xmath58 using the ratio of energies of the sequential resonances in our numerical results we can define the serial numbers of the resonances . then choosing the distance @xmath54 properly we can fit the resonance energies . </S>",
    "<S> the fitting leads to a simple equation : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a parameter ( @xmath61 ) , which only slightly depends on the device geometry and the fermi level in the reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the distance @xmath43 and the background positive charge density affect the power @xmath56 of the effective scattering potential , which affects on the resonance energies slightly .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have shown that the interaction between the electrons of the different subbands in 1d-2d junctions essentially affects the electron transport in qpcs and qws . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction results in the transmission resonances which clearly evidence the formation of quasi - bound states in the region of the potential landscape maximum . </S>"
