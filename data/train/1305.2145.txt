    "_ mycobacterium tuberculosis _ is the cause of most occurrences of tuberculosis ( tb ) and is usually acquired via airborne infection from someone who has active tb .",
    "it typically affects the lungs ( pulmonary tb ) but can affect other sites as well ( extrapulmonary tb ) .",
    "only approximately 10% of people infected with _ mycobacterium tuberculosis _",
    "develop active tb disease .",
    "therefore , approximately 90% of people infected remain latent .",
    "latent infected tb people are asymptomatic and do not transmit tb , but may progress to active tb through either endogenous reactivation or exogenous reinfection @xcite .    without treatment ,",
    "mortality rates are high , but the anti - tb drugs developed since 1940 dramatically reduce mortality rates ( in clinical cases , cure rates of 90% have been documented ) @xcite .",
    "however , tb remains a major health problem . in 2010",
    "there were an estimated 8.5 to 9.2 million cases and 1.2 to 1.5 million deaths .",
    "tb is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide after hiv @xcite .",
    "one can distinguish three types of tb treatment : vaccination to prevent infection ; treatment to cure active tb ; treatment of latent tb to prevent endogenous reactivation @xcite .",
    "the treatment of active infectious individuals can have different timings @xcite . here",
    "we consider treatment with the duration of six months . in these treatments",
    "one of the difficulties to their success is to make sure that the patients complete the treatment . indeed , after two months , patients no longer have symptoms of the disease and feel healed , and many of them stop taking the medicines . when the treatment is not concluded , the patients are not cured and reactivation can occur and/or the patients may develop resistent tb . one way to prevent patients of not completing the treatment",
    "is based on supervision and patient support .",
    "in fact , this is one of the measures proposed by the direct observation therapy ( dot ) of world health organization ( who ) @xcite .",
    "one example of treatment supervision consists in recording each dose of anti - tb drugs on the patients treatment card @xcite .",
    "these measures are very expensive since the patients need to stay longer in the hospital or specialized people are to be payed to supervise patients till they finish their treatment . on the other hand",
    ", it is recognized that the treatment of latent tb individuals reduces the chances of reactivation , even if it is still unknown how treatment influences reinfection @xcite .",
    "optimal control is a branch of mathematics developed to find optimal ways to control a dynamic system @xcite .",
    "while the usefulness of optimal control theory in epidemiology is nowadays well recognized @xcite , results in tuberculosis are scarce @xcite . recently , different optimal control problems applied to tb have been proposed and analyzed @xcite .",
    "the first paper appeared in 2002 @xcite , and considers a mathematical model for tb based on @xcite with two classes of infected and latent individuals ( infected with typical tb and with resistant strain tb ) where the aim is to reduce the number of infected and latent individuals with resistant tb . in @xcite",
    "the model considers the existence of a class called _ the lost to follow up individuals _ and they propose optimal control strategies for the reduction of the number of individuals in this class . in @xcite",
    "the authors adapt a model from @xcite where exogenous reinfection is considered and wish to minimize the number of infectious individuals . in @xcite a tb model that incorporates exogenous reinfection , chemoprophylaxis of latently infected individuals and treatment of infections",
    "is proposed .",
    "optimal control strategies based on chemoprophylaxis of latently infected individuals and treatment of infectious individuals are analyzed for the reduction of the number of active infected individuals .",
    "our aim is to study optimal strategies for the minimization of the number of active tb infectious and persistent latent individuals , taking into account the cost of the measures for the treatments of these individuals .",
    "for that , we study the mathematical model for tb dynamics presented in @xcite , where reinfection and post - exposure interventions are considered .",
    "the importance of considering reinfection and post - exposure interventions is justified in @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : tbmodel ] we modify the model of @xcite adding two controls @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are functions of time @xmath2 , and two real positive parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we also explain the meaning of these and the other parameters of the tb model .",
    "a sensitivity analysis for the basic reproduction number is given in section  [ sec : sensitivity ] .",
    "in section  [ sec : opt : cont : prob ] we formulate the optimal control problem .",
    "we prove that the problem has an unique solution , and finally we apply to it the celebrated pontryagin maximum principle @xcite . in section  [ sec : num : results ] we propose optimal control strategies , obtained by numerical simulations , considering several variations of some of the parameters of the tb model .",
    "we end with section  [ sec : conc ] of conclusion .",
    "we study the mathematical model from @xcite where reinfection and post - exposure interventions are considered .",
    "we add to that model two control functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 and two real positive parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting model is given by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations : @xmath7 the population is divided into five categories ( , control system has five state variables ) : susceptible ( @xmath8 ) ; early latent ( @xmath9 ) , , individuals recently infected ( less than two years ) but not infectious ; infected ( @xmath10 ) , , individuals who have active tb and are infectious ; persistent latent ( @xmath11 ) , , individuals who were infected and remain latent ; and recovered ( @xmath12 ) , , individuals who were previously infected and treated . the control @xmath13 represents the effort that prevents the failure of treatment in active tb infectious individuals @xmath10 , , supervising the patients , helping them to take the tb medications regularly and to complete the tb treatment . the control @xmath14 represents the fraction of persistent latent individuals @xmath11 that is identified and put under treatment .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , measure the effectiveness of the controls @xmath18 , @xmath17 , respectively , , these parameters measure the efficacy of treatment interventions for active and persistent latent tb individuals , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that at birth all individuals are equally susceptible and differentiate as they experience infection and respective therapy .",
    "moreover , the total population , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , is assumed to be constant , , the rate of birth and death , @xmath21 , are equal ( corresponding to a mean life time of 70 years @xcite ) and there are no disease - related deaths . the assumption that the total population @xmath19 is constant , allows to reduce the control system from five to four state variables .",

    "the parameter @xmath28 denotes the rate at which individuals leave @xmath9 compartment ; @xmath29 is the proportion of individuals going to compartment @xmath10 ; @xmath30 is the rate of endogenous reactivation for persistent latent infections ( untreated latent infections ) ; @xmath31 is the rate of endogenous reactivation for treated individuals ( for those who have undergone a therapeutic intervention ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is the factor that reduces the risk of infection , as a result of acquired immunity to a previous infection , for persistent latent individuals , , this factor affects the rate of exogenous reinfection of untreated individuals ; while @xmath34 represents the same parameter factor but for treated patients . in our simulations we consider the case where the susceptibility to reinfection of treated individuals equals that of latents : @xmath35 .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is the rate of recovery under treatment of active tb ( assuming an average duration of infectiousness of six months ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 apply to latent individuals @xmath9 and @xmath11 , respectively , and are the rates at which chemotherapy or a post - exposure vacine is applied . in @xcite",
    "different values for these rates are considered : the case where no treatment of latent infections occur ( @xmath38 ) ; the case where there is an immediate treatment of persistent latent infections ( @xmath39 ) ; or there is a moderate treatment of persistent latent infections ( @xmath40 $ ] ) .",
    "the first and second cases are not interesting from the optimal control point of view . in our paper",
    "we consider , without loss of generality , that the rate of recovery of early latent individuals under post - exposure interventions is equal to the rate of recovery under treatment of active tb , @xmath41 , and greater than the rate of recovery of persistent latent individuals under post - exposure interventions , @xmath42 .",

    "and persistent latent individuals @xmath11 , @xmath161 and @xmath136 ,",
    "when no controls are used.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we now show a new situation where the controls have a crucial role : without controls the number of infected increases , while using the optimal control approach the number of infected decreases and remains always in a lower level .",
    "let @xmath163 , @xmath137 , and @xmath164 .",
    "take , for example , @xmath165 .",
    "if the control measures @xmath13 and @xmath14 are not implemented , then the number of active infected individuals @xmath10 increases in all the treatment period . however ,",
    "if the control measures @xmath13 and @xmath14 are used ( see figure  [ fig : u_1:u_2:b250 ] for the optimal controls ) an important decrease of active infected individuals is observed ( see figure  [ fig : i : com : e : sem : cont : b250 ] ) .",
    "without controls the basic reproduction number is @xmath166 and with controls @xmath167 .",
    "other cost functionals could be considered in the optimal control problem , namely a cost @xmath168 where the category of persistent latent individuals @xmath11 is not considered in , that is , @xmath169 dt.\\ ] ] however , in figures  [ fig : i : l2:costs ] and [ fig : i : l2:costs : b175 ] we observe , for different values of @xmath43 , that when we consider the cost functional , the fraction of active infectious individuals is lower compared with the case when we consider only active infectious tb individuals @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath163 , @xmath170 , @xmath137 and @xmath171 .",
    "when we compare the controls @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the cost functionals @xmath129 and @xmath168 , we observe that a bigger effort is required on the controls when we propose to minimize @xmath134 .",
    "if our aim is to minimize the active infected individuals @xmath10 as well as the cost of the control measures represented by @xmath13 ( preventive measures applied to active infected individuals for a complete treatment with anti - tb drugs ) , then the control @xmath13 never attains the maximum value and the control measure @xmath14 is not required , see figure  [ fig : u_1:u_2:costs : b100 ] .    when @xmath172 , if we want to minimize the cost functional @xmath168 then the control @xmath13 attains the maximum value for approximately 1.1 years",
    "; if we want to minimize the cost functional @xmath129 then the control @xmath13 attains the maximum value for approximately 3.9 years .",
    "analogously to the case @xmath135 , for @xmath172 the control measure @xmath14 is not required when we wish to minimize @xmath168 , see figure  [ fig : u_1:u_2:costs : b175 ] .",
    "the bigger effort on the control measures associated to the cost functional @xmath129 is justified by a reduction on the fraction of active infected individuals @xmath10 and persistent latent individuals @xmath11 , when compared to the case of minimizing @xmath168 , see figure  [ fig : i : l2:costs ] .",
    "this reduction is more significant if we consider @xmath172 , see figure  [ fig : i : l2:costs : b175 ] .",
    "finally , we can compare the effect of the implementation of two controls strategies : apply only the control @xmath13 ( supervision and support of tb infectious individuals @xmath10 ) ; and apply simultaneously @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the treatment of persistent latent individuals @xmath11 , for example with a prophylactic vaccine , is not so usual as the treatment of active infectious individuals , which is one of the measures proposed by the direct observation therapy ( dot ) of world health organization ( who ) , but is a valid tb treatment strategy @xcite . observing figure  [ fig : i : l2:only : u1 ] , we conclude that each control @xmath13 and @xmath14 implies a reduction on the respective fraction of the population , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , if we choose to minimize the cost function , then the best choice is to apply both controls simultaneously , since the implementation of control @xmath14 does not imply a reduction on the fraction of active infectious individuals .",
    "for this reason , if we choose to minimize the cost function , then the best control strategy is to implement only control @xmath13 .",
    "the incidence rates of tb have been declining since 2004 worldwide , namely due to prevention and treatment policies that have been applied in the last years @xcite .",
    "mortality rates , at global level , fell down around 35% between 1990 and 2009 , and if the current rate of decline is sustained , by 2015 the target of a 50% reduction can be achieved .",
    "the reduction of mortality and incidence rates depend on the effort at country level to implement control policies",
    ". examples of policies that had a great success in who s six regions are the dots strategy ( 1995 - 2005 ) and its sucessor _ stop tb _ launched in 2006 ( see @xcite for further details ) . in this paper",
    "we study a mathematical model for tb proposed in @xcite , from the optimal control point of view .",
    "optimal time - dependent prevention policies , that consider the execution cost , are proposed .",
    "we tried different numerical approaches and we observed that the results are the same , independently of the method used .",
    "in particular , two approaches have been tried : direct and indirect .",
    "the direct methods discretize the problem turning it into a nonlinear optimization problem .",
    "indirect methods use the pontryagin maximum principle @xcite as a necessary condition to find the optimal curve for the respective control : we substitute into and the obtained system of five equations is solved numerically together with the five equations of system .",
    "figures  [ fig : com : e : sem : controlos ] and [ fig : u1u2:com : e : sem : controlos ] show that when controls are considered , the optimal policies provide a reduction of 1230 active infectious and persistent latent individuals .",
    "the cost execution of the control policies related to control @xmath13 is assumed to be greater or equal to the one related to control @xmath14 ( see section  [ sec : num : results ] ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : variar : w1 ] and [ fig : w1igualw2 ] show that when the cost of implementation of control policies related to control @xmath13 decreases , the amount of @xmath13 increases , and when the cost of implementation of control policies related to control @xmath14 decreases , the amount of @xmath14 increases .",
    "we considered different values for the transmission coefficient parameter @xmath43 corresponding to the case where the disease may become endemic .",
    "we observe that as the transmission coefficient increases , the period of time that the control @xmath13 ( associated to the effort that prevents the failure of treatment of active infectious individuals ) is at the upper bound also increases , as well as the fraction of active infectious and persistent latent individuals ( figure  [ fig : variar : beta ] ) .",
    "we assume that the total population @xmath19 is constant and figure  [ fig : variar : n ] illustrates that optimal control strategies do not vary significantly when different sizes of population are taken .",
    "as we can see in figure  [ fig : variar : epsilon ] , the measures of the efficacy of control policies @xmath3 and @xmath4 strongly influence the effect of the control policies related to @xmath13 and @xmath14 on the minimization of the number of active infectious and persistent latent individuals .    as future work",
    ", it would be interesting to consider different values for the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and observe the variations on the optimal control strategies .",
    "in addition , we intend to study optimal control strategies for the minimization of the fraction of active infectious and/or persistent latent individuals , when susceptibility to reinfection of treated individuals differs from that of latent : @xmath173 or @xmath174 .",
