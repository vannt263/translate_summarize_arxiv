    "in recent years there has been a renewed interest   in the theory of zero  temperature quantum phase transitions initiated in 1976 by hertz s quantum dynamic renormalization group @xcite for itinerant ferromagnets .",
    "distinctively from temperature driven critical phenomena , these phase transitions occur at zero temperature as a function of some non  thermal control parameter ( or a competition between different parameters describing the basic interaction of the system ) , and the relevant fluctuations are of quantum rather than thermal nature .",
    "it is well known from the theory of critical phenomena that for the temperature driven phase transitions quantum effects are unimportant near critical points with @xmath6 .",
    "it could be expected , however , that at rather small ( as compared to characteristic excitation in the system ) temperature , the leading @xmath7 dependence of all observables is specified by the properties of the zero  temperature critical points , which take place in quantum systems .",
    "the dimensional crossover rule asserts that the critical singularities of such a quantum system at @xmath8 with dimensionality @xmath0 are formally equivalent to those of a classical system with dimensionality @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the dynamical critical exponent ) and critical temperature @xmath6 .",
    "this makes it possible to investigate low  temperature effects ( considering an effective system with @xmath0 infinite space and @xmath10 finite time dimensions ) in the framework of the theory of finite ",
    "size scaling ( fss ) .",
    "the idea of this theory has been applied to explore the low  temperature regime in quantum systems ( see refs . ) , when the properties of the thermodynamic observables in the _ finite  temperature quantum critical region _ have been the main focus of interest .",
    "the very _ quantum critical region _ was introduced and studied first by chakravarty et al  @xcite using the renormalization group methods .",
    "the most famous model for discussing these properties is the quantum nonlinear @xmath11 sigma model ( qnl@xmath12m).@xcite    recently an equivalence between the qnl@xmath12 m in the limit @xmath13 and a quantum version of the spherical model or more precisely the `` spherical quantum rotors '' model ( sqrm ) was announced.@xcite the sqrm is an interesting model on its own . due to the remarkable opportunity it offers for",
    "a rigorous study of finite  size effects at arbitrary dimensionality sqrm may play the same role in quantum critical phenomena as the popular berlin  kac spherical model in classical critical phenomena .",
    "the last one became a touchstone for various scaling hypotheses and a source of new ideas in the general theory of finite size scaling ( see for example refs .",
    "and references therein ) .",
    "let us note that an increasing interest related with the spherical approximation ( or large @xmath14limit ) generating tractable models in quantum critical phenomena has been observed in the last few years.@xcite    in ref .  , the critical exponents for the zero  temperature quantum fixed point and the finite  temperature classical one as a function of dimensionality was obtained .",
    "what remains beyond the scope of ref .",
    "is to study in an exact manner the scaling properties of the model in different regions of the phase diagram including the _ quantum critical region _ as a function of the dimensionality of the system . in the context of the finite  size scaling theory both cases : ( i ) the infinite @xmath0dimensional quantum system at low ",
    "temperatures @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the finite  size in the imaginary time direction ) and ( ) the finite system confined to the geometry @xmath17 ( @xmath2linear space size ) are of crucial interest .    in this paper a detailed theory of the scaling properties of the quantum spherical model with nearest  neighbor interaction is presented .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : we start with a brief review of the model and the basic equations for the free energy and the quantum spherical field in the case of periodic boundary conditions ( section  [ model ] ) .",
    "the relation of this model with the model due to schneider , stoll and beck@xcite has been briefly commented in section  [ other ] .",
    "since we would like to exploit the ideas of the fss theory , the bulk system in the low  temperature region is considered like an effective ( @xmath18)dimensional classical system with one finite ( temporal ) dimension .",
    "this is done to enable contact to be made with other results based on the spherical type approximation e.g. in the framework of the spherical model and the qnl@xmath12 m in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "the scaling forms of the free energy and of the spherical field equation are derived for the infinite ( section  [ isys ] ) and finite ( section  [ fsys ] ) system confined to the general geometry @xmath19 . in section  [ analysis ]",
    "we analyze in detail the equation for the spherical field .",
