    "previous studies have shown that molecular gas is hard to study in dwarf galaxies , even in those who are known to be rich in neutral atomic gas ( ) , such as dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) and blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) .",
    "as carbon monoxide ( co ) is the second most common molecular species after molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath3 ) , and the one most easily observed in its cool , unshocked state , it is usually used as a tracer of molecular gas .",
    "relatively few dwarf galaxies have been detected in co , though many have been observed ( e.g. , taylor , kobulnicky & skillman 1998 , barone et al .",
    "dwarf galaxies are set apart from from other -rich galaxies by their low metallicity : recent work suggested that the co - to - h@xmath3 ( ` x ' ) conversion factor is dependent upon the metallicity of the gas , with the conversion factor increasing as metallicity decreases ( arimoto , sofue & tsojimoto 1996 , wilson 1995 , verter & hodge 1995 , rubio et al.1991 ) .",
    "maloney & black ( 1988 ) argued on theoretical grounds that at low metal abundances , the column density of co will be lower , and there will be less self shielding from dissociating radiation .",
    "this will cause the size of the co emitting region to shrink , while leaving the h@xmath3 unaffected .",
    "norman & spaans ( 1997 ) predict that metallicities starting somewhere between 0.03 to 0.1 of the solar value are necessary before co will be detectable .",
    "observationally , taylor et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have found no dwarf galaxies with detectable co emission at metallicities below @xmath5 0.15 solar .",
    "however , at present there are too few dwarfs with both metallicity measurements and co observations to determine reliably if there is indeed a cutoff , and where exactly it might take place .    for the few dwarfs which have been detected in co , following up those single dish detections with high spatial resolution interferometer data has proven enlightening . in some cases ,",
    "the high resolution of interferometers allow the direct estimate of the total mass of resolved giant molecular clouds in nearby dwarf galaxies independent of the co intensity , and from this a first determination of the co  to ",

    "( 1999 ) used the plateau de bure interferometer to observe co ( 10 ) and ( 21 ) in the post - starburst dwarf galaxy ngc  1569 .",
    "they found that the conversion factor was three times higher than in two other dwarf galaxies of the same metallicity ( ngc6822 and ic10 ) , suggesting that metallicity is not the only influence upon the conversion factor .",
    "motivated by this and other previous studies , we have observed another starburst dwarf galaxy , ngc  4214 , at owens valley .",

    "ngc  4214 has two main regions of star formation  a large complex of regions displaying a shell morphology in the galaxy center , and a smaller southern complex formed mainly of compact knots ( mackenty et al .",
    "2000 ) . from age determinations of the regions and their spatial distribution , they argue that some of the younger star formation has been triggered by the interaction of the older regions with the surrounding ism . at a distance of 4.1 mpc ( leitherer et al .",

    "the data for each array were edited and calibrated separately with the mma and the miriad packages .",
    "the _ uv_data were inspected and bad data points due to either interference or shadowing between telescopes were removed , after which the data were calibrated . we fourier transformed our c and l array observations separately for each pointing to assess their quality ; subsequently we combined all data to form a single dataset which was used for mapping .",
    "the mosaicing and mapping was performed using the task mossdi in miriad , i.e.  a joint deconvolution of the entire mosaic was done to obtain the final data cubes .",
    "all the results presented in this paper are based on this combined dataset .",
    "we calculated 2 data cubes , one with natural weighting , leading to a resolution of @xmath12 , and another one with robust weighting ( setting the robust parameter to 0 , briggs 1995 ) with a resolution of @xmath13 .",
    "the final rms noise in our 1.3  wide channels is 40 mjybeam@xmath9 ( 100mk ) and 47 mjybeam@xmath9 ( 210mk ) for the naturally and robustly weighted cube , respectively .",
    "we optimized the cleaning process by defining 3 clean boxes around the prominent emission regions .",
    "a summary of the observations can be found in tab .",
    "channel maps of the data cube are presented as contours in fig .",
    "[ table3 ]      we distinguished co emission from the noise using the following procedure : the cleaned 1.3 data cube was smoothed to a spatial resolution of 9  @xmath14  9 , and a 2@xmath15 ( 80 mjy beam@xmath9 ) blanking was applied to the output cube .",
    "the resulting cube was searched for co emission by looking for surviving features which were continuous in at least 3 consecutive channels .",
    "this gave a cube containing only the co emission at a resolution of 9 .",
    "this cube was then applied as a mask to the original resolution naturally weighted cube to yield the final blanked data cube .",
    "the mask was also applied to the robustly weighted cube , and moment maps were made from the data of both weightings ( fig .  1 ) .    the locations and sizes ( fwhm ) of the ovro primary beams comprising our mosaic",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "while we can not be certain to have detected all the co emission in ngc  4214 , we have probably mapped all the strong emission .",
    "our first set of observations included only the center mosaic position , but in those data we still detected both the northwestern and southeastern regions , even though they lay beyond the 40% power radius of the primary beam , therefore if there were any similar co features just beyond the beam areas shown in fig .  7 ,",
    "we would have detected them .",
    "it would be interesting to estimate the degree of missing flux due to the lack of short spacings in our interferometric map .",
    "this might give some indication of the amount and distribution of diffuse gas in and between the complexes .",
    "unfortunately , there are no single dish observations of the co distribution in ngc  4214 that are suitable for such a determination .",
    "the single dish beam is either very large ( @xmath16 ) with a pointing center offset from the peak position of any complex , thus partially containing several complexes ( taylor et al .",
    "1998 , thronson et al .",
    "1988 , tacconi & young 1985 ) , or the observed region is not sufficiently extended and spatially disjunct ( ohta et al .",
    "1993 ) , or the observations were done in a different transition ( becker et al .",
    "1995 for the central complex ) .",
    "as seen in the moment map presented in fig .  1 , there are three regions where we have detected co emission in ngc  4214  one at the center of the galaxy , another @xmath5 650 pc to the southeast of the center , and the third @xmath5 760 pc to the northwest .",
    "the southeastern region ( se ) has the highest peak in co emission , and is also the most centrally concentrated .",
    "the central region is extended in the east - west direction , with low intensity co emission that has a diffuse appearance except for the concentration at its western end .",
    "the northwestern region ( nw ) is intermediate between the central and the southeastern ones , both in the degree of central concentration and the intensity of the emission .",
    "each of the regions can be divided into discrete units ( clumps ) by considering both spatial and velocity information given in the data cube . to do that , we inspected the high  resolution robust  weighted cubes by looking at ` movies ' as well as position  velocity ( pv ) diagrams .",

    "c1c14 are likely not giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  3 , where we show the size - linewidth relation for gmcs in m33 from wilson & scoville ( 1990 ) , along with gmcs from m33 , m31 ( vogel et al .",

    "rand et al .",
    "argue that their objects are intermediate in size , linewidth , and molecular mass between the largest gmcs known in the milky way , and giant molecular associations ( gmas ) seen in nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. rand & kulkarni 1990 ) .",
    "our resolved objects have smaller diameters compared to the rand et al .",
    "objects  they are probably not gmas . also , gmas tend to have masses of a few @xmath6 m@xmath17 , whereas for an assumed galactic co - h@xmath3 conversion factor , our clumps have masses that are lower by almost two orders of magnitudes .",
    "[ table4 ]      starbursting dwarf galaxies tend to be rich ( e.g. thuan & martin 1981 , taylor et al .",

    "4 shows the co contours from fig .  1 superposed on the total intensity map of the emission ( corrected for primary beam attenuation ) .",

    "may thus be fairly common .    a global comparison between the and co emission reveals differences between the various co emitting regions .",
    "the nw region of co emission falls on top of a local maximum in the column density , while the se region , which is brighter and more centrally concentrated , corresponds to a dip in the column density near two local peaks .",
    "the central co region is extended enough to cover several local minima and maxima in the , though the shape of the is elongated east - west , similar to the co emission .",
    "it should be noted here that the strongest molecular emission is not necessarily found where the column densities are highest .",
    "this finding emphasizes the ` irregular ' nature of dirrs .",
    "the co and channel maps are compared in fig .",
    "this representation of the data emphasizes more strongly the location of the se co emission in a small dip , and the association of the nw co emission region with a local maximum roughly coincident in velocity .",
    "there is no clear correlation in the channel maps between co and for the central co feature .",
    "6 is a pv - diagram through the three brightest co peaks and compares the co and velocities and intensities in and near these peaks .",
    "for the se ( offset : 0.75@xmath21 ) and central peak the co linewidths are much narrower than the corresponding linewidths .",
    "in contrast , in the the nw peak ( at offset 0.7@xmath21 ) the co linewidth is larger , probably due to substructure in the complex , and approaches the velocity width of the to within a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "star formation occurs at densities where the gas is primarily molecular , so it is of interest to compare the molecular gas tracer , co , to tracers of the stellar component . because the ism is readily ionized by the intense uv radiation from young stars in regions , h@xmath4",
    "is often used as an indicator of the presence of recent star formation .",

    "1993 , devost et al .",
    "1997 , martin 1998 ) , and are presumably caused by the energetic by - products of star formation , supernovae and stellar winds .",

    ", right ) .",
    "the se co clump appears cospatial with a large star forming complex containing several regions .",
    "the peak of the co emission here is almost directly on top of one of the regions , and the shape of the co complex with its slight extension in the north - south direction is very similar to that of the  region . the central co emission is associated with the largest region of h@xmath4 emission .",
    "unlike the se complex , the central co complex is diffuse instead of centrally concentrated , and the peak of the co emission here is not directly on top of the h@xmath4 emission , but is shifted to the west of it .",
    "lower level co emission is cospatial with the h@xmath4 , however , tracing out the chain of brighter  regions running east - west in this area .",
    "in clear contrast , only very faint h@xmath4 emission is associated with the nw co complex .    at this point",
    "it is interesting to compare the velocities of the molecular gas with the ones of the ionized component ( as seen in h@xmath4 spectra ) .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "( 1986 ) presented the kinematics of a few regions within ngc4214  four of them correspond to regions where we also detected co emission ( their regions : h25/29 , close to our nw co complex ; h36 and h48 , towards the central complex ; and h55 in the se complex ) . in all cases",
    "do the systemic co and h@xmath4 velocities agree well ( this is consistent with the results by maiz ",

    "8 shows the contours of the co emission superposed on a multi - band optical image created by the hubble heritage team . here",
    ", the quite different optical morphologies of the regions where co emission is found are evident more dramatically .",
    "this composite image was created from different wfpc2 pointings in the f336w ( u ) , f502n ( [ o iii ] ) , f555w ( v ) , f656n ( h@xmath4 ) , f702n ( r ) , and f814w ( i ) filters . a detailed discussion of these data is published by mackenty et al .  ( 2000 ) .    both beck , turner & kovo ( 2000 ) and mackenty et al .",

    "there is 6 and 20 cm emission associated with the central and se star forming complexes , but nothing is detected at the location of the nw co emission ( turner 2000 , private comm . ) .",
    "this lack of radio continuum emission indicates that indeed very little star formation is associated with the nw molecular region ( c1c8 ) and that the presence of only very weak optical emission lines is not due to possible extinction .",
    "to determine the conversion factor with a reasonable degree of confidence , a discrete unit of emission , such as a gmc , must be distinguishable in the data , and there must be a method to determine the total mass associated with this feature which is independent of co intensity .",
    "gmcs are often assumed to be gravitationally bound and in virial equilibrium , allowing the use of the virial theorem to determine the total mass .",
    "as discussed above , our spatial resolution will not resolve gmc ",
    "sized objects at the distance of ngc  4214 . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we decided to derive virial masses for our clumps anyway  in the discussion that follows we will keep in mind that at least some of them are likely _ not _ gravitationally bound objects . in the cases",
    "where the complex is not spatially resolved we took the beamsize ( @xmath24pc ) as an upper limit for the actual diameter ",
    "then , the virial masses are probably upper limits ( but see the discussion below ) . if the virial mass could be trusted , dividing it by the molecular mass derived using a galactic co - h@xmath3 conversion factor would yield the actual conversion factor for each feature , in units of the galactic value .",
    "the galactic conversion factor is taken to be @xmath25@xmath26(kkms@xmath9)@xmath9 ( strong et al.1988 ) , with an additional explicit correction for helium ( see caption in table 4 ) . if the recalibrated conversion factor of @xmath27@xmath26(kkms@xmath9)@xmath9 ( hunter et al.1997 ) or the new value advocated by dame et al .",

    "the average conversion factor we find for the few resolved features is compatible with the standard galactic conversion factor ( tab .",
    "4 ) given all the uncertainties in deriving these numbers .",
    "the mean conversion factor is @xmath30 , whether or not only the resolved clouds or all clouds are used for the estimate .",
    "this is a lower value than the conversion factor estimated for other dwarf galaxies with similar metallicities in the literature ( @xmath31 for the dirr ic10 , @xmath32 for the dirr ngc  6822 , both in the local group , wilson 1995 , and @xmath33 in the post - starburst dwarf galaxy ngc  1569 , taylor et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "this result is unexpected at first glance since one would expect the x  factor to be higher in this low metallicity galaxy ( as suggested by other studies of low ",
    "metallicity dwarfs , see above ) .",
    "we can only speculate here why the results in ngc4214 are different .",
    "we should like to note that the virial masses are strongly affected and possibly even dominated by the resolution ( both spatially and kinematically ) employed in the observations .",
    "e.g. , if we use our naturally weighted , 5  channel width data ( i.e. , if we do not resolve the substructure ) we derive a virial mass for the nw complex which is several times higher than the mass derived using @xmath34 .",
    "this is due to fact that the dispersion in the nw region is rather large ( @xmath35v@xmath36 ) resulting in a much higher x  factor ( because of the @xmath37 dependence of the virial mass )  in other words our result would then be consistent with the values found in other low  metallicity galaxies ! it should be also stressed here that deriving cloud properties ( and hence virial masses ) is not at all an objective process : e.g. , different radii have been used by different authors ( e.g. , diameter defined by the half  intensity line ; or by the contour containing 90% of the flux ) and the cloud sizes are not always de ",
    "convolved for the beamsize . dividing clumps into sub ",
    "clumps is also always subject to to some personal bias .",
    "it should be also noted at this point that convincing arguments have been presented ( e.g.  bolatto et al .  1999 ,",
    "madden et al .",
    "1997 ) for a cloud structure in dwarf galaxies that significantly differs from what is found in metal - rich giant spirals . in this scenario ,",
    "small co cores are embedded in huge molecular envelopes which are devoid of co. the molecular hydrogen in the envelopes coexists with and .",
    "e.g. , madden et al .  argue that in the dwarf irregular ic10 the total molecular mass may be up to 100 times the mass contained in the co cores . in this case",
    "our co observations would only trace the cores of the clouds and the derived ` local ' x  factor would be only valid for the central core of a molecular cloud , where it might indeed be close to the galactic value , since the conditions in the core region are expected to be similar to those in a galactic gmc .",
    "unfortunately , based on the data presented here all this remains subject to speculation . in the case of ngc4214",
    "the matter might be investigated further by a comprehensive study of the co , , , radio continuum and fir emission , along the lines of the study madden et al .",
    "performed for the ( much closer ) galaxy ic10 .    based on our data , we will adopt @xmath34 as the conversion factor for ngc  4214 in the following , primarily for convenience .",
    "we keep in mind that this number is unfortunately only poorly determined and that our molecular gas mass estimated might be off by a factor of 2  3 .",
    "given the fact that the se molecular cloud seems not yet to be disrupted by the ongoing burst of star formation ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ effects ] ) , we can try to calculate the star formation efficiency for that region . from table 3 of mackenty et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we derive a sfr for this region of 0.066m@xmath38year@xmath9 ( their region ii , corrected for ` medium internal extinction ' ) .",
    "for morphological reasons",
    "( e.g.  the compact and filled appearance of the  regions , the lack of large cavities and the positional coincidence of exciting star clusters and h@xmath4 emitting knots ) , star formation presumably only recently started here  we adopted an age of @xmath53 million years ( mackenty et al .",
    "this results in a total stellar mass of @xmath39m@xmath38 produced to date ( assuming a constant sf rate ) . from our table 4 , we derive a molecular mass of @xmath40m@xmath38 ( summing up regions c10c14 and adopting a galactic x  factor , see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ xfact ] ) .",

    "is thought to exist , at @xmath42 2 , above which massive star formation can proceed and below which it is suppressed .",
    "the physical reason for this threshold may be related to the density needed for the shielding of molecular gas from dissociating radiation ( e.g. skillman 1987 ) , or perhaps to disk instabilities ( e.g.  kennicutt 1989 ) . for this kind of analysis , generally some measure of the spatial extent of the star formation activity ( such as an h@xmath4 image )",

    "there is hardly any change in the lowest contour , indicating that at densities of @xmath44 2 the gas is primarily in atomic form .",
    "the higher contours , however , show marked changes from alone to total gas density , particularly at the location of the se co complex . in the total gas map",
    ", we see a peak in gas density corresponding to the group of regions , whereas if we consider the alone , the h@xmath4 emission sits in a local minimum of density , adjacent to two local peaks .",
    "the peak gas density in the total gas map at this complex is 6.6@xmath19 2 . in the central complex",
    "the addition of the molecular component also makes a difference , connecting two peaks that straddle the center of the star forming complex .    from fig .",
    "9 it is apparent that there is only very faint h@xmath4 emission associated with the co emission of the nw complex , suggesting very little star formation .",
    "this lack of activity is confirmed by the non - detection of radio continuum emission at the position of the nw complex .",
    "the peak ( plus h@xmath3 ) column density here is 95% that of the se clump , where we see evidence for vigorous star formation . the column density in the central ,",
    "very actively star forming region is considerably lower , but this could be explained by the influence of the massive stars upon the ism in a more evolved star formation region ( see next section ) . a plausible explanation for the lack of star formation in the nw complex is suggested by fig .  6 , the comparison of the co and velocities / linewidths .",
    "here we see that the linewidth in co in the nw complex is comparable to the linewidth , while for the other two complexes co is much narrower .",
    "perhaps the _ surface _ density along the line of sight to the nw complex is high , but the _ volume _ density is not .",
    "the large linewidth and identifiable substructure in the nw complex suggests a distribution of clouds at different velocities along the line of sight , rather than one dense cloud .",
    "it may also be that star formation has simply not started yet in the nw complex in which case another episode of star formation might begin in the near future .",
    "massive stars , the most prominent constituents of star forming regions , input energy into the ism through mechanisms such as ionizing photons , stellar winds and supernovae , and it is inevitable that they will disrupt the local ism . in some dwarf galaxies , such as ic  2574 , swept out holes in the accumulate large quantities of gas on their rims , providing material for a second generation of star formation ( walter et al .  1998 , stewart & walter 2000 ) . in ngc  4214",
    "there is no evidence for this .",
    "there are certainly a number of holes in the ( fig .",
    "4 ) but the star forming regions do not appear along their rims ( as is apparent in the supergiant shell in ic  2574 ) .",
    "there are several small expanding shells of ionized gas associated with the central star forming region ( martin 1998 ) and these might later develop shells like those seen in ic  2574 .    on scales of a few hundred pc ,",
    "the ism shows indications of the effects of the massive stars .",
    "the  regions in the central star forming complex show a shell morphology ( figs .  8 and  9 ) which suggests that these shells have broken through the dense material surrounding the massive stars .",
    "the se  regions still show compact , knotlike morphologies , suggesting that a breakout has not yet occurred ( mackenty et al .",
    "if the starburst of the central region preceded the se one , then the massive stars in the center have been at work dissociating and disrupting the molecular gas for a longer time than in the se .",
    "thus the co intensity associated with the shell  regions is lower and the emission is more diffuse than @xmath45pc to the west , where the highest co intensity in the central complex is found , away from the immediate vicinity of any  region .",
    "the brightest co emission in the galaxy , associated with the  regions in the se complex , may represent a pre - disruption stage where the energy input into the ism from the young stars has not had enough time to affect a large fraction of the molecular gas or the general morphology of the complex and is thus not visible in our 90pc resolution observations . in summary ,",
    "ngc  4214 seems to show molecular gas and star formation in 3 distinct stages : high  dispersion molecular gas with hardly any associated star formation in the nw , concentrated molecular gas with very recent star formation in the se and diffuse molecular gas with an older massive star formation burst in the center .",
    "we have mapped the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc  4214 in the @xmath0co ( 10 ) transition at the ovro millimeter array with a linear resolution of @xmath46pc .",
    "this first high - resolution study of the molecular component in this galaxy shows the presence of three molecular complexes which are in very different and distinct evolutionary stages .",
    "both from the properties of the molecular gas and from hst and ground  based optical studies of the  regions and star clusters , the central region is the most evolved : here , the molecular complex is highly disrupted , the impact of the massive star formation is largest , and a shell structure is in the process of forming . the star formation episode in the se complex is more recent ; thus , the dense ism adjacent to the newly formed massive stars is far less disrupted , providing an ideal environment for ongoing , maybe self - propagating star formation proceeding further into the complex .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , massive star formation has not started yet in the nw complex , possibly because the threshold volume density has not been reached in this region .    a comparison with the reveals that no clear correlation between the and co surface densities exists . although the ne and sw regions have almost the same total ( and h@xmath3 ) gas column density , violent star formation is only taking place in the sw region .",
    "this nicely illustrates the irregular nature of these dwarf systems .",
    "the and h@xmath4 velocities are in good agreement with the co velocities measured in the three molecular complexes . assuming a galactic conversion factor , the star formation efficiency for the se complex is @xmath47% , similar to the one found for spiral galaxies .",
    "this may be taken as an indication that the star formation process itself in dwarf galaxies proceeds in a similar way to that in spirals .",
    "we were able to subdivide the molecular complexes further into 14 sub  complexes .",
    "most of the clumps can not be resolved with our synthesized beam  even the resolved objects are probably not gmcs .",
    "deriving virial masses from these objects is not trivial and is affected by personal bias and the employed velocity and spatial resolution .",
    "our clump analysis is compatible with a galactic conversion factor for ngc4214 ; this is substantially lower than the value found in other dwarf galaxies with similar metallicities so far .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in deriving this value we can not rule out the validity of the metallicity  x relation based on our data .",
    "we derive a total molecular mass for ngc4214 of 5.1@xmath48m@xmath49 .    in summary ,",
    "our ovro observations of the molecular gas in the metal  poor dwarf galaxy ngc4214 reveal an unexpected structural wealth  they serve as a good excuse to map similar low  metallicity dwarf galaxies with interferometers in the future : even though the emission is faint when compared to spiral galaxies , high  resolution observations of the molecular gas can provide important insights to the irregular nature of dwarf galaxies .",
