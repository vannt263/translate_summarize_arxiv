    "one of the most important goals of current cosmological studies is to unveil the nature of the so - called dark energy or _ quintessence _ , the exotic negative - pressure component responsible for the accelerating expansion of our universe . over the last years",
    ", a number of candidates for this dark energy have been proposed in the literature @xcite , with the vacuum energy density ( or cosmological constant ) and a dynamical scalar field @xcite apparently constituting the most plausible explanations . from the observational viewpoint , these two class of models",
    "are currently considered our best description of the observed universe whereas from the theoretical viewpoint they usually face fine - tunning problems , notably the so - called cosmological constant problem @xcite as well as the cosmic coincidence problem , i.e. , the question of explaining why the vacuum energy or the scalar field dominates the universe only very recently .",
    "the later problem happens even for tracker versions of scalar field models in which the evolution of the dark energy density is fairly independent of initial conditions @xcite .    among the many dark energy candidates ,",
    "a recent and very interesting proposal has been suggested by kamenshchik _",
    "_ @xcite and developed by bili _",
    "_ @xcite and bento _ et al .",
    "it refers to the so - called chaplygin gas ( c ) , an exotic fluid whose equation of state is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath3 a positive constant .",
    "actually , the above equation for @xmath7 generalizes the original chaplygin equation of state proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite whereas for @xmath8 , the model behaves like scenarios with cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant ( @xmath9cdm ) .    in the context of the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies , whether one inserts eq .",
    "( 1 ) into the energy conservation law ( @xmath10 ) , the following expression for the energy density is immediately obtained @xmath11^{\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}},\\ ] ] or , equivalently , @xmath12^{\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the current energy density ( from now on a subscript @xmath14 means present day quantities , and c denotes either the chaplygin gas or its generalized version ) .",
    "the function @xmath15 is the cosmic scale factor , @xmath16 is a constant and @xmath17 is a quantity related to the present day chaplygin adiabatic sound speed ( @xmath18 ) . as can be seen from the above equations , the c - gas interpolates between non - relativistic matter ( @xmath19 ) and negative - pressure dark component regimes ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this particular behavior of the chaplygin gas inspired some authors to propose a unified scheme for the cosmological  dark sector \" @xcite , an interesting idea which has also been considered in many different contexts @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "in the theoretical front , a connection between the chaplygin equation of state and string theory had long been identified by bordemann and hoppe @xcite and hoppe @xcite ( see also @xcite for a detailed review ) . as explained in such references , a chaplygin gas - type equation of state",
    "is associated with a parametric description of the invariant nambu - goto @xmath21-brane action in a @xmath22 spacetime . in the light - cone parameterization ,",
    "such an action reduces itself to the action of a newtonian fluid which obeys eq .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath6 , with the c - gas corresponding effectively to a @xmath21-branes gas in a ( @xmath23)-dimensional spacetime .",
    "another interesting connection is related to recent attempts of describing the dark energy component through the original chaplygin gas or its generalized version .",
    "such a possibility has provoked a growing interest for exploring the observational consequences of this fluid in the cosmological context .",
    "for example , fabris _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed some consequences of such scenario using type ia supernovae data ( sne ia ) .",
    "their results indicate that a universe completely dominated by the chaplygin gas is favored when compared with @xmath9cdm models . recently ,",
    "avelino _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a larger sample of sne ia and the shape of the matter power spectrum to show that such data restrict the model to a behaviour that closely matches that of a @xmath9cdm models while bento _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the location of the cmb peaks imposes tight constraints on the free parameters of the model .",
    "more recently , dev , alcaniz & jain @xcite and alcaniz , jain & dev @xcite investigated the constraints on the c - gas equation of state from strong lensing statistics and high-@xmath24 age estimates , respectively , while silva & bertolami @xcite studied the use of future snap data together with the result of searches for strong gravitational lenses in future large quasar surveys to constrain c - gas models .",
    "_ @xcite also showed that such models are consistent with current sne ia data for a broad range of parameters .",
    "the trajectories of statefinder parameters @xcite in this class of scenarios were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite while constraints involving cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data have also been extensively discussed by many authors @xcite .    in this work we study the possibility of constraining the generalized chaplygin equation of state from x - ray luminosity of galaxy clusters . with basis on measurements of the mean baryonic mass fraction in clusters as a function of redshift",
    ", we consider the method originally proposed by sasaki @xcite and pen @xcite , and further modified by allen _",
    "@xcite who analyzed the x - ray observations in some relaxed lensing clusters observed with chandra in the redshift interval @xmath25 ( see also @xcite ) . by inferring the corresponding gas mass fraction , allen and collaborators placed observational limits on the total matter density parameter , @xmath26 , as well as on the density parameter @xmath27 , associated to the vacuum energy density .",
    "more recently , a similar analysis has also been applied to conventional quintessence models with an equation of state @xmath28 by lima _",

    "iv , we finish the paper by summarizing the main results and comparing our constraints with others derived from independent analyses .",

    "the x - ray gas mass fraction ( @xmath46 ) values were determined for a canonical radius @xmath47 , which is defined as the radius within which the mean mass density is 2500 times the critical density of the universe at the redshift of the cluster . in order to generate",

    "the term @xmath52 represents the change in the hubble parameter between the default cosmology and quintessence scenarios and the ratio @xmath53 accounts for deviations in the geometry of the universe from the default cosmology ( scdm model ) . in fig .",
    "1 we show the behavior of @xmath54 as a function of the redshift for some selected values of @xmath55 and @xmath4 having the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 fixed . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "the current favored cosmological model , namely , a flat scenario with @xmath58 of the critical energy density dominated by a cosmological constant ( @xmath9cdm ) is also shown . in order to have bidimensional plots we fix the value of @xmath26 as suggested by dynamical estimates @xcite , i.e. , 0.3 in fig .",

    "3a we display contours of the combined likelihood analysis for the parametric space @xmath81 . in comparison with fig .",
    "we see that the available parameter space is reasonably modified with the value of @xmath55 constrained to be @xmath82 at 95.4% c.l . and the entire interval of @xmath83 $ ] allowed .",
    "the best fit model occurs for values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 degrees of freedom ( @xmath88 ) .",

    "alternative cosmologies with a quintessence component ( dark energy ) may provide an explanation for the present accelerated stage of the universe as suggested by the sne ia results . in this work",
    "we have focused our attention on a possible dark energy candidate , the so - called chaplygin gas .",
    "the equation of state of this dark energy component has been constrained by combining chandra observations of the x - ray luminosity of galaxy clusters and independent measurements of the hubble parameter and of the baryonic matter density as well as from a statistical combination between x - ray data and recent sne ia observations .",
    "we have shown that stringent constraints on the free parameters of the model , namely @xmath55 , @xmath4 and @xmath31 , can be obtained from this combination of observational data .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the results derived here with another independent analyses .",
    "for example , using only sne ia data , fabris et al .",
    "@xcite found @xmath99 for the original c - gas model ( @xmath6 ) with the matter density parameter constrained by the interval @xmath100 .",
    "the same analysis for @xmath101 ( in which the c - gas plays the role of both dark matter and dark energy ) provides @xmath102 .",
    "these values agree at some level with the ones obtained from statistics of gravitational lensing ( sgl ) , i.e. , @xmath103 @xcite and age estimates of high-@xmath24 galaxies ( ohrg s ) , @xmath104 - @xmath105 for the interval @xmath106 with lower values of @xmath55 corresponding to lower @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the original chaplygin gas model , however , seems to be incompatible with the localization of the acoustic peak of cmb as given by wmap @xcite and boomerang @xcite data . for the case of a generalized component",
    ", the same analysis shows that for intermediary values of the spectral tilt @xmath107 , the c - gas model is favored by this data set if @xmath108 @xcite . a similar analysis for boomerang and",
    "arqueops @xcite data implies @xmath109 for @xmath110 @xcite whereas an investigation involving wmap and sne ia data sets restricts @xmath4 to be @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that our results are in line with the above quoted independent studies . in particular , even considering that the parameter @xmath55 is quite insensitive to the x - ray data alone , the matter density parameter is very well constrained .",
    "this result is also in agreement with the limits derived by allen et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath9cdm models .",
    "in addition , as shown in figure 3b , by combining the x - ray and sne ia data sets , more stringent constraints on the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath55 are readily obtained . from the above analyses we also note",
    "that the @xmath4 parameter is more strongly restricted if causality requirements ( @xmath112 are imposed ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "however , it seems that a even better method to place limits on such a parameter is through the physics of the perturbations , i.e. , cmb and lss data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we study some observational consequences of a dark energy candidate , the so - called generalized chaplygin gas which is characterized by an equation of state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are positive constants . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the prospects for constraining the equation of state of this dark energy component by combining chandra observations of the x - ray luminosity of galaxy clusters , independent measurements of the baryonic matter density , the latest measurements of the hubble parameter as given by the hst key project and data of the supernova cosmology project . </S>",
    "<S> we show that very stringent constraints on the model parameters can be obtained from this combination of observational data . </S>"
