    "they found that @xmath1 increases with increasing black hole mass and uv luminosity ( in terms of the eddington luminosity ) and decreases with increasing x - ray luminosity ( in terms of eddington luminosity ) , and argue that this implies that the fraction of bolometric luminosity emitted by an accretion disc ( thermal ) , as compared to a corona ( non - thermal ) , increases with increasing accretion rate relative to eddington .",
    "this may suggest that quasars and agn should exhibit an evolution and a variety of accretion states should be observed .",

    "we applied two methods of data analysis .    in the first method ( method 1 ) , we fitted simultaneously the pca / hexte ( 3200 kev ) spectra with a model consisting of a multicolour disc blackbody , thermal comptonization ( thcomp in xspec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gaussian line profile to model iron k@xmath39 feature , and smeared edge ( smedge ) to account for iron k@xmath39 absorption .",
    "we also added galactic absorption with @xmath40 fixed throughout the outburst at best values from literature ( table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) , and a constant to account for differences in normalization between pca and hexte ( the constant has been fixed at 1 for pca ) .",

    "we perform constant*powerlaw fits with the constants for each hexte detector fixed at the values found in method 1 .",
    "we used only the data sets which gave the reduced @xmath43 and for which the photon index could be constrained between 1 and 8 at 90 per cent confidence level , in total 1006 observations . in this method , the @xmath32 is derived from 2040 kev hexte fits and @xmath31 is taken from models described in method 1 .    in both methods",
    "the photon index is a fit parameter and we use eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] to calculate @xmath0 .",
    "method 1 is more comprehensive because in general it is based on the broad band pca / hexte fits .",
    "hence , the results drawn from method 1 can be regarded as a reference for our considerations .",
    "conversely , method 2 ` mimics ' the methodology commonly applied to the agn , for which conclusions about radiation mechanisms are drawn based on incomplete information about the spectra , i.e. discontinuous observations taken in optical / uv ( cool disc ) and x - rays .",
    "thus , results of method 2 are better suited for gbhs vs. agn comparison .",
    "studies of large samples consisting of agn observed with different x - ray missions can not rely on hardness ratios because this would introduce instrumental effects instead , @xmath1 parametrisation based on spectral fits is used .",
    "we also use spectral fits to perform a consistent analogy between the gbhs and agn .",
    "we note however that we get consistent and robust results on @xmath0 independently on the spectral model as long as the fit is good ( see sobolewska , gierliski , siemiginowska 2009 in preparation , where we use eqpair to fit the data of gro  j1655 - 40 ) . in the remaining of the paper we compare gbhs with the agn .",

    "there is a characteristic circular pattern in the diagram resembling that seen in the gbhs hardness - intensity diagrams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , hardness - intensity diagrams in the literature use diverse definitions of hardness , and based on them it is difficult to draw direct analogies between gbhs and agn .",
    "uniform parametrization with @xmath0 that we propose in this paper makes such a comparison straightforward ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "below we describe how the spectral evolution of gro  j1655 - 40 throughout an outburst affects evolution of @xmath26 .",
    "this can be generalized to the case of other gbhs , as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "there is no linear correlation between the @xmath28 and @xmath44 , and there is no unique value of @xmath0 characteristic of a given spectral state . at the beginning of the outburst ( observation 1 in fig .",

    "disc and comptonization luminosities increase , but the spectral shape does not change much , and @xmath0 stays approximately constant ( observation 2 ) . during the hard - to - soft state transition the source moves toward the upper right corner of the plot ( observation 3 ) and @xmath0 increases . in the soft spectral state the disc flux does not vary significantly as opposed to the comptonized component flux , and wide range of @xmath0 is covered while the source moves up and down on the diagram ( observations 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 ) .",

    ". the @xmath26 decreases ( observation 8) and the source moves back to the hard state ( observation 9 ) .",
    "data succeeding observation 9 have statistics too poor to be considered in method 2 , because hexte is not sensitive enough to give reasonable results for such low luminosity hard states . similarly , a number of data sets surrounding observation 4 were excluded by method 2 .",
    "these data represent an ultra - soft state , with a weak comptonized tail .",
    "future observations with more sensitive hard x - ray detectors ( e.g. nustar , exist ) will provide a better coverage for the sources in the low luminosity hard state .",
    "central black holes in agn are 58 orders of magnitude more massive than in gbhs .",
    "disc temperature scales with mass as @xmath5 for a given fraction of eddington luminosity , so the disc is cooler in agn and emits in optical / uv band instead of soft x - rays . for agn ,",
    "the disc - to - comptonization slope called x - ray loudness is defined for @xmath45 kev and 2 kev , whereas we define our @xmath0 for 3 and 20 kev .",
    "this means that the disc - to - comptonization slope , parametrized by @xmath0 in gbhs , needs to be scaled , or ` stretched ' , before it can be directly compared with @xmath1 in agn .",
    "we account for the shift of the disc spectrum towards lower energies in agn by defining @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and @xmath0 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : eq2 ] . after this correction , a spectrum of a gbh and a spectrum of an agn with the same ratio of the disc normalization to the comptonization normalization will result in a comparable @xmath48 and @xmath1 indices .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] we show the results of calculating @xmath48 both directly from the pca / hexte fits ( method 1 , cyan ) and from the method that mimics the agn studies , and uses only a part of the hard x - ray spectrum , here 2040 kev ( method 2 , red ) .",
    "both methods give similar results , but method 2 is more restrictive and excludes significant number of data points in the soft and ultra - soft states and in the hard state with low luminosity , where the hexte data are too weak to constrain @xmath32 .",

    "this state is dominated by the accretion disc emission , so there is a threshold to the amount of the comptonization at a given thermal disc emission , e.g. a maximum to the division of the energy release between the disc and the corona in the accretion process .",
    "the @xmath51 is consistent with being constant in the hard state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]b  c ) . in the intermediate and soft states we find formal correlations of @xmath51 with the disc and comptonization fluxes , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the former correlation is consistent with those found for agn @xcite .",
    "the later is marginally consistent with only the correlation reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* they consider , however , dependence of @xmath1 on monochromatic x - ray luminosity in eddington units , and here we do not correct gbh luminosities for difference in black hole mass ) .",
    "we do not see any obvious correlation between the photon index and either the disc or comptonization flux in any of the spectral states . this result does not change if the fluxes are expressed in the eddington units , as in @xcite .",
    "the intermediate state data may form narrow tracks due to transitions between the hard and soft states ( e.g. figs .",
    "[ fig : fig7]b - c ) . the soft and intermediate states in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]c seem to be restricted by the @xmath71 function .",
    "this limit is formed by the data with highest @xmath44 flux that for our sources does not exceed @xmath640 kev @xmath34 s@xmath10 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig7]a - b ) .",
    "interestingly , the slope of this limit is consistent with the @xmath1 and @xmath27 correlation found by @xcite .",
    "in this paper we drew analogy between accretion disc vs. comptonized component emissions in gbhs and agn .",
    "we introduced an @xmath72 parameter to describe the seds of gbhs throughout their outbursts .",
    "this new parameter has the same physical meaning and occupies the same range of values as the x - ray loudness , @xmath1 , used to characterize the agn optical - to - x - ray spectra .",
    "the central engine in both agn and gbhs is powered by a black hole accreting matter from the host galaxy ( agn ) or from a companion star ( gbhs ) .",
    "thus , the underlying physics and radiative processes producing sed in these two classes of objects should be similar .",
    "in particular , the properties of @xmath1 and @xmath51 distributions , and the way they depend on other spectral observables should correspond to each other .",
    "we have applied the methodology commonly used in the agn studies to a number of _ rxte _ data of gbhs .",
    "we found that the majority of the observed type 1 radio quiet agn may be in a spectral state similar to a very high state , which is one of the soft states of gbhs , or in an intermediate state .",
    "we base this conclusion on two findings .",
    "first , detailed analysis of gbh outbursts during which sources cover all spectral states shows that @xmath49 distribution has three distinctive peaks : @xmath6 1 ( corresponding to the hard spectral state ) , @xmath73 ( very high / intermediate state ) and @xmath74 ( typical soft and ultra - soft state ) , while the @xmath1 distribution for agn is single - peaked with an average close to 1.5 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]  and  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "second , the analysis of the @xmath48 vs. x - ray photon index,@xmath2 , diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) reviled that type 1 rqqs occupy the same region as the gbhs in the intermediate / very high state .",
    "interestingly , @xcite reported that ark 564 stays most probably in the very high / intermediate state .",
    "this conclusion was reached based on the variability studies and position of characteristic frequency in power density spectrum of this seyfert 1 .",
    "however , we note that a fraction of agn from the @xcite sample reminds the soft state gbhs .",
    "we argue that the observed radio - loud quasars may also be the counter - parts of the very high / intermediate state gbhs .",
    "this is in agreement with the gbhs studies that show presence of the radio emission in some of the very high / intermediate states , shortly after the transition from the hard ( or typical soft ) state ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "we should note here that the peak in the distribution of @xmath51 around 1.5 is a superposition of the radio - quiet and radio - loud states . in the @xcite jet model for gbhs",
    "the radio - quiet ( soft ) and radio - loud ( hard , intermediate , very high ) states are separated with so called jet line placed at a certain value of hardness ration . in our description , this would correspond to @xmath751.5 ( the approximate border line between the intermediate / very high and soft state data , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]b ) , which interestingly fits between the maxima of the distributions of the @xmath1 for the radio - loud and radio - quiet agn ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "more detailed discussion of the connection between the radio - loud agn and gbhs is however beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we note that spectra of liners show spectral indices similar to those seen in the hard state gbhs .    the presence of three peaks in the distribution of @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) indicates that the time of transition between the spectral states is much shorter than the time the source spends in a given state .",
    "thus , physical conditions resulting in characteristic spectral shapes must be relatively ` stable ' .",
    "analogous @xmath1 distribution should be expected in agn , and the most important question arising from this study is whether agn able to form the two peaks at @xmath1 around 1 and 2 exist , but are missed in present surveys .",
    "it is possible that the two extreme peaks apparent in the distribution of @xmath48 are missed in agn samples due to selection effects .",
    "the agn samples rely on optical detections , hence low disc luminosity hard state objects with @xmath76 could be absent from the sample .",
    "the agn optical flux in the hard state would be low and buried within the host galaxy emission , and thus they could not be classified as agn .",
    "however , hard state agn still should be present and even detected in x - ray surveys .",
    "it is interesting to note that they may ` mimic ' so - called absorbed sources , as their x - ray spectra will be hard .",
    "their emission would contribute to the hard x - ray background emission .",
    "the agn counterparts of the ultra - soft gbhs with @xmath77 might have been omitted because their x - ray emission is probably too weak to be detected by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. this aspect is considered in more details in our next paper ( sobolewska et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "all gbhs contain a black hole of similar mass , of the order of several solar masses ( see e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , the agn samples contain black holes that differ in mass even by 34 orders of magnitude .",
    "it is known that the mass of the central objects affects the temperature of the accretion disc and thus alters the overall broad band energy distribution .",
    "thus , in paper ii we discuss how the mass spread in agn samples can affect the results .",
    "in particular we check if the correlations between the spectral indices and disc and/or comptonization fluxes ( not observed here , or not consistent with the agn observations ) may arise as the effect of mass distribution in the agn samples . on the other hand , our results presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : relations ] provide predictions for relations between the @xmath1 and monochromatic fluxes in a narrow black hole mass bin .",
    "such studies may soon become possible as the number of agn for which black hole masses were estimated from independent methods ( gas / star dynamics , line widths , variability properties ) increases .",
