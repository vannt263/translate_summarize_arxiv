    "in this monograph we develop a theory of crossed products that allows for a locally compact group to act on an arbitrary operator algebra , not just a @xmath1-algebra .",
    "we establish foundational results , uncover permanence properties and demonstrate important connections between our crossed product theory and various lines of current research in both the non - selfadjoint and the @xmath1-algebra theory .",
    "the reader familiar with the non - selfadjoint literature knows well that crossed product type constructions have occupied the theory since its very beginnings .",
    "however most constructions in that theory involve the action of a semigroup which rarely happens to be a group , on an operator algebra which is usually a @xmath1-algebra .",
    "there is a good reason for this and it goes back to the early work of arveson @xcite .",
    "arveson recognized that in order to better encode the dynamics of a homeomorphism @xmath2 acting on a locally compact space @xmath3 , one should abandon group actions and instead focus on the action of @xmath4 on @xmath5 implemented by the positive iterates of @xmath2 .",
    "this initiated the study of what peters coined as the semicrossed product @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the study of semicrossed products by @xmath4 , @xmath7 ( the free semigroup on @xmath8 generators ) and other important semigroups has produced a steady stream of important results and continues to this day at an increasing pace and depth @xcite .    in this monograph",
    "we follow a less - travelled path : we start with an arbitrary operator algebra , preferably non - selfadjoint , and we allow a whole group to act on it .",
    "it is remarkable that there have been no systematic attempts to build a comprehensive theory around such algebras even though this class includes all crossed product @xmath1-algebras .",
    "admittedly , our interest in group actions on non - selfadjoint operator algebras arose reluctantly as well . indeed , apart from certain important cases ( see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) , the structure of automorphisms for non - selfadjoint operator algebras is not well understood .",
    "our initial approach stemmed from an attempt to settle two open problems regarding semi - dirichlet algebras ( which we do settle using the crossed product ) .",
    "we soon realized that even for very  elementary \" automorphisms ( gauge actions ) , the crossed product demonstrates a behavior that allows for significant results .",
    "the monograph is organized in eight chapters , including this introduction which appears as chapter  [ intro ] .",
    "chapter  [ prel ] establishes the terminology used in the monograph and contains many of the fundamental results from operator algebra theory that we require in the sequel .",
    "most of the results contained here come from five main sources @xcite , with additional sources mentioned within the chapter .",
    "chapter  [ prel ] also contains some original material , i.e. , propositions  [ prop integral ] and [ extension ] , to be used in later chapters .    in chapter  [ basic ]",
    "we define the various crossed products appearing in the monograph . given a @xmath1-dynamical system @xmath9 there are two natural choices for a crossed product , the ( full ) crossed product @xmath10 and the reduced crossed product @xmath11 . in the general case of an operator algebra @xmath12",
    "there are many more choices , which we call relative crossed products , depending on the various choices of a @xmath1-cover for @xmath12 . after a careful consideration ,",
    "we single out the appropriate choice for the ( full ) crossed product ( definition  [ fulldefn ] ) as the relative crossed product coming from the universal @xmath1-cover @xmath13 of @xmath12 .",
    "because all relative reduced crossed products coincide ( corollary [ allrcoincide ] ) , the quest for a reduced crossed product trivializes . with the appropriate definitions at hand , we can now transfer results from the selfadjoint theory to our context . for instance , in theorem  [ full raeb ] we generalize to the non - selfadjoint setting a result of raeburn  @xcite regarding the universality of the crossed product of @xmath1-algebras . in theorem  [ r =",
    "f ] we show that if the locally compact group @xmath14 is amenable , then all relative crossed products coincide ; the proof of this result requires the theory of maximal dilations @xcite . in theorem  [ naimark ]",
    "we give a  covariant \" generalization of naimark s theorem on positive definite group representations .",
    "this allows us to obtain the von neumann - type inequality of corollary  [ vonneumann ] .",
    "iterated crossed products play a prominent role in the selfadjoint theory .",
    "our first task in chapter [ takai ] is to explain how to make sense of an iterated crossed product within the framework of our theory .",
    "after accomplishing this , we move on to takai duality .",
    "indeed one of the central results of the selfadjoint theory involving iterated crossed products is the takai duality theorem @xcite , which extends the pontryagin duality to the context of operator algebras and @xmath1-dynamical systems . in theorem  [ takai duality ]",
    "we succeed in extending the takai duality to the context of arbitrary dynamical systems not just selfadjoint . apart from its own interest",
    ", this extension has significant applications for the study of semisimplicity for operator algebras , as witnessed in chapter  [ semis ] .",
    "( see theorem  [ tsemis ] and example  [ texam ] . )",
    "one of the immediate consequences of our early theory and a key ingredient in the proof of our takai duality , is the identity @xmath15 ( see theorem  [ cmaxthm ] . )",
    "one of the motivating questions of the monograph is the validity of the other identity @xmath16 regarding the @xmath1-envelope of the crossed product . in chapter",
    "[ basic ] we verify this identity in the case where @xmath14 is a locally compact abelian group ( theorem  [ abelianenv ] ) . in chapter  [ dirichlet sect ] we continue this investigation and in theorem  [ dirichletenv ] we verify ( [ introident ] ) in the case where @xmath12 is dirichlet but @xmath14 arbitrary . in chapter  [ dirichlet sect ] we also present the first application of our theory . in @xcite , davidson and",
    "katsoulis made a comprehensive study of dilation theory , commutant lifting and semicrossed products , with the class of semi - dirichlet algebras playing a central role in the theory . at the time of the writing of @xcite , our understanding of the abundance of semi - dirichlet algebras",
    "was limited and the following two questions arose regarding them .",
    "are there any semi - dirichlet algebras which are not isometrically isomorphic to tensor algebras of @xmath1-correspondences ? are there any semi - dirichlet algebras which are neither tensor algebras of @xmath1-correspondences nor dirichlet algebras ? in theorem  [ crossedtensor ] and corollary  [ neither ] we answer both questions in the affirmative . a key ingredient in producing these results",
    "is theorem  [ generatingsemidir ] which asserts that the reduced crossed product of a semi - dirichlet operator algebra is also semi - dirichlet .",
    "if one wishes to study semi - dirichlet algebras , then the crossed product is indeed an indispensable tool .    in chapter  [ semis ]",
    ", we uncover another permanence property in the theory of crossed product algebras . in theorem  [ firstsemisimple ]",
    "we show that if @xmath12 is a semisimple operator algebra and @xmath14 a discrete abelian group , then @xmath10 is semisimple .",
    "this raises the question whether the converse is also true .",
    "it turns out that in certain cases this is indeed true but in other cases it is not . to demonstrate this we investigate a class of operator algebras which was quite popular in the mid 90s : triangular af algebras @xcite . building on the beautiful ideas of donsig @xcite , we prove theorem  [ mainsemisimple ] which states that if @xmath12 is a strongly maximal taf algebra and @xmath14 a discrete abelian group , then the dynamical system @xmath9 is linking if and only if @xmath17 is semisimple . in example  [ linking example ] , we present an example of a non - semisimple taf algebra @xmath12 that admits a linking automorphism @xmath18",
    ". therefore @xmath19 is semisimple even though @xmath12 is not , thus refuting the converse of theorem  [ firstsemisimple ] .",
    "on the other hand , theorem  [ tuhfsemisimple ] shows that for tuhf algebras the semisimplicity of @xmath12 and @xmath10 are equivalent properties .",
    "we expect more in this direction , with the investigation of other dynamical systems @xmath9 and the semisimplicity of the associated crossed products .",
    "we truly envision the study of semisimplicity ( or other permanence properties ) for crossed products as a theory that will parallel in interest and abundance of results that of simplicity for selfadjoint crossed products . as evidence",
    "we offer a remarkable , we believe , result which shows that for crossed products by compact abelian groups , the situation of theorem  [ firstsemisimple ] reverses . in theorem  [ tsemis ] we show that if @xmath10 is a semisimple operator algebra and @xmath14 a compact abelian group , then @xmath12 is semisimple .",
    "furthermore , in example  [ texam ] we show the converse is not in general true .",
    "both these results are accomplished through the use of our non - selfadjoint takai duality .",
    "chapter  [ hao ] makes a connection with a topic in @xmath1-algebra theory , which is currently under investigation or impacts the work of various authors , including abadie , bedos , deaconu , hao , kaliszewski , katsura , kim , kumjian , ng , quigg , schafhauser and others @xcite . these authors are either using or currently investigating the validity of the hao - ng isomorphism theorem beyond the class of amenable locally compact groups .",
    "this is a problem seemingly irrelevant to the non - selfadjoint theory as it involves the functoriality of two crossed product constructions in @xmath1-algebra theory .",
    "it is a consequence of our theorem  [ hntensor1 ] that the investigation of the previously mentioned authors is equivalent to resolving the identity ( [ introident ] ) for a very special class of non - selfadjoint dynamical systems @xmath9 , where @xmath12 is the tensor algebra of a @xmath1-correspondence and @xmath20 , the action of a locally compact group by generalized gauge automorphisms .",
    "actually , theorem  [ hntensor1 ] leads to a recasting of the hao - ng isomorphism problem , which we verify in the case of ( not necessarily injective ) hilbert bimodules ( theorem  [ hnbim ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the main focus of chapter  [ hao ] is not the hao - ng isomorphism problem itself but instead verifying another permanence property for the crossed product : the crossed product of a tensor algebra @xmath12 by a locally compact group @xmath14 of gauge automorphisms remains in the class of tensor algebras .",
    "( we have seen in theorem  [ crossedtensor ] that this is not the case when the group @xmath14 acts by arbitrary automorphisms . ) in order to obtain the affirmative answer ( theorem  [ hntensor2 ] ) we use a result of independent interest , which we label the extension theorem .",
    "the extension theorem ( theorem  [ extend ] ) gives a very broad criterion for verifying whether an operator algebra  naturally \" containing a @xmath1-correspondence @xmath21 is isomorphic to the tensor algebra of @xmath21 .",
    "this a very general result with additional applications to appear elsewhere .",
    "the monograph closes with chapter  [ problems ] , where we list some open problems for further investigation . with each open problem listed ,",
    "we give a brief commentary intended to help the reader guide himself through the pertinent material or literature .",
    "two of these problems concern the classification of crossed products .",
    "this a topic which is left untouched in this monograph and we plan to address it in a subsequent work .    beyond the specific problems of chapter  [ problems ] , this work also suggests two general directions for future research : one  abstract \" and another one more  concrete \" .",
    "the current @xmath1-algebra literature is occupied with the study of more general concepts of a crossed product , e.g. , crossed products by coactions , twisted actions and much more .",
    "this is such a broad area that we will not even be attempting to survey it here ; see however @xcite and the references therein . if one wishes to develop non - commatative duality and the appropriate versions of our non - selfadjoint takai duality of chapter  [ takai ] , then the abstract study of these more general crossed products at the non - selfadjoint level is of the highest priority .    on the concrete side",
    ", the non - selfadjoint operator algebra theory is currently being infused by a wealth of very deep and far - reaching studies . in a broad sense , the current rapid development of  free analysis \" and ",
    "free function theory \" involves naturally certain non - selfadjoint operator algebras , as witnessed in the works of muhly and solel @xcite , popescu @xcite and others .",
    "closer to this monograph , shalit and solel @xcite pioneered recently the study of a new class of operator algebras , the tensor algebras of subproduct systems .",
    "these algebras exhibit a very diverse and unexpected behavior as demonstrated in the recent papers @xcite .",
    "even for very special cases the study of these algebras relates to topics which are very popular and quite demanding , such as the drury - arveson spaces and algebraic varieties associated with ideals @xcite , stochastic matrices @xcite , subshifts @xcite and more .",
    "it seems to us that the tensor algebras of subproduct systems and their peripheral algebras should be the natural place to extend the theory of chapter  [ hao ] .",
    "in particular it would be very interesting to see how the hao - ng isomorphism problem manifests itself in that context .",
    "this of course hinges on understanding what the cuntz - pimsner algebra of a subproduct system should be ; again this is a topic of important current research @xcite .",
    "finally a word about the groups appearing in this monograph .",
    "our main goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of crossed products that is applicable to all locally compact groups .",
    "hence the majority of our work concerns that generality .",
    "nevertheless many of our results are new and interesting even in the case where @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , this is the case with all ( counter)examples appearing in chapter  [ dirichlet sect ] or the semisimplicity results of chapter  [ semis ] . a special mention needs to made for chapter  [ hao ] .",
    "there we took the unusual step of  duplicating \" proofs in order to give a more elementary and self - contained treatment of the case where @xmath14 is discrete .",
    "we believe that this adds to the monograph as it makes very accessible a work that bridges the selfadjoint with the non - selfadjoint theory .",
    "the term _ operator algebra _ is understood to mean a norm closed subalgebra of the algebra of all bounded operators acting on a hilbert space . all algebras in this monograph are assumed to be approximately unital , i.e. , they possess a contractive approximate identity . all representations ( and homomorphisms into multiplier algebras , whenever applicable ) will be required to be non - degenerate .    on occasion we will need to exploit the richer structure of unital operator algebras .",
