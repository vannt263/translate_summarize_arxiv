    "while both the warm and hot components of the igm have respectively been detected through ly@xmath17 absorption systems ( see the review by @xcite and the references therein ) and in x - ray emission ( see review by @xcite ) , the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) has been extremely difficult to detect .",
    "the whim is highly ionized due to the high temperatures , so can not be detected in absorption except in x - ray lines of heavy elements such as oxygen .",
    "it is also too diffuse for its thermal emission to be detected with current x - ray instruments .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamical simulations @xcite show that while warm gas consitute @xmath23 of the mass fraction of baryons at @xmath24 , the whim becomes the dominant component at @xmath25 with a mass fraction of @xmath26% .",

    "there have been many attempts to search for these ` missing baryons ' constituting the whim at @xmath25 using current uv and x - ray instruments , with various claimed detections of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 emission and absorption lines associated with the whim ( see review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , these detections often arise from the tail end of the distribution of whim overdensities or temperatures .",
    "additionally , measurements of such highly ionized atoms require further assumptions about the metallicity of the gas in order for total baryon densities to be inferred .    in the radio regime , various methods",
    "have been proposed as to how the whim and the ionized igm as a whole can be detected and studied . @xcite",

    "recent detections of fast radio bursts ( frbs ) @xcite have opened up a new avenue for probing the igm through their radio dispersion @xcite , found to be in excess of that expected from the milky way and thought to originate from the ionized igm .    scattering effects such as scintillation , the temporal smearing of impulsive sources and the angular broadening of compact sources provide another alternative for probing the ionized igm .",
    "these effects , like dispersion , are sensitive not only to the whim but all ionized components of the igm , including the hot intracluster gas and the ionized components of the warm photoionized gas , the latter of which ly@xmath17 absorbers trace only the neutral components .",

    "the possibility of detecting the angular broadening of compact sources with the square kilometre array ( ska ) is briefly discussed by @xcite . however , they assume that the scattering mainly occurs in galaxies similar to the milky way , rather than in the more diffuse igm components where the bulk of the baryons reside .",
    "interestingly , two of the 13 frbs detected to date also exhibit temporal smearing , though whether this scattering originates in the host medium or in the intervening igm is still hotly debated @xcite .",
    "in fact , the pulse broadening ( and dispersion ) of radio bursts from extragalactic supernovae have long been proposed by @xcite as suitable probes of the igm , while @xcite have discussed the feasibility of probing angular broadening of compact sources observed through rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "the scintillation , angular broadening and pulse broadening of pulsars and other sources due to the interstellar medium ( ism ) have been used with great success to map out the distribution of ionized structures in our galactic ism @xcite , and the aim is to do the same for the igm with extragalactic sources .    as the detectability of scintillation and temporal smearing in the igm",
    "have been rigorously discussed elsewhere @xcite , this paper is solely concerned with the prospects of detecting and probing the various components of the ionized igm and other turbulent extragalactic structures through the angular broadening of compact sources .",
    "studies of the three effects are complementary since they probe the igm on different scales and respond differently to the distribution of scattering material along the ray path ; angular broadening is preferentially weighted towards material located closer to the observer . in section  [ model ] , we apply the theory of scattering at a thin screen , extended to cosmological scales , to models of various components of the igm to analyse their contributions to angular broadening .",
    "we discuss the strongest limits on angular broadening in the igm to date ( section  [ obconstraints ] ) , based on existing observational data .",

    "the left panel of figure  [ igmangmod2 ] shows @xmath78 for various values of @xmath66 , @xmath79 and @xmath34 , for electron densities equivalent to the mean electron densities of the universe ( @xmath82 and @xmath62 ) at all epochs . for simplicity",
    ", @xmath83 is assumed for all redshifts , implying that the turbulence is fully developed at all redshifts of interest .",
    "@xmath34 is also assumed to be independent of @xmath66 , so that turbulence is continually injected into the igm at the same scales at all redshifts .        for igm components whose densities",

    "the values of @xmath78 are of order @xmath4 nas to @xmath86as for outer scales of turbulence between 1 mpc and 1 kpc , at 1 ghz and for @xmath82 , with the exception of scattering screens located close to the background source where @xmath78 drops to much lower values .",
    "this means that scatter broadening is strongly weighted against contributions by the background host galaxy medium , due to the lever arm effect as @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath78 increases for overdense regions in the igm , as shown in similar plots in figure  [ igmangmod2 ] , for a source at @xmath88 and scattering screens of overdensity @xmath89 ( middle panel ) and @xmath90 ( right panel ) .",
    "screen densities that expand with the hubble flow are shown as blue curves , whereas gravitationally - bound screens with constant proper densities are shown as black curves .",
    "scatter broadening in gravitationally - bound scattering screens is dominated by objects at @xmath91 , since there is no @xmath80 dependence of electron densities to offset the lever - arm effect and the increasing frequencies at the rest - frame of the scattering screen .",
    "again , scatter broadening in the host medium of the background source is relatively insignificant .",
    "the amplitude of the scatter broadening is subject to additional constraints depending on the nature of the turbulence responsible for the underlying electron density fluctuations .",
    "a specific argument advanced by @xcite in the context of temporal smearing relates to a model of intergalactic turbulence based on sonic density fluctuations in a diffuse medium .",
    "they argue that the sonic velocity perturbations associated with the density fluctuations deposit energy on a timescale comparable to that on which the waves traverse the outer scale of the turbulence .",
    "this must be large , @xmath92 cm @xmath93mpc , for the implied heating rate to be comparable to the cooling rate .    for kolmogorov turbulence , the amplitude of the density fluctuations on a scale @xmath94 is @xmath95 for a medium with a mean density @xmath42 . following the arguments outlined in @xcite , an outer scale of at least @xmath96 cm ( @xmath4mpc ) therefore implies scatter broadening on an angular scale , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the electron charge , @xmath99 is the electron mass , @xmath100 is the wavelength of the radiation , @xmath101 its corresponding frequency in ghz , and assuming @xmath77 .",
    "this upper limit is roughly consistent ( within a factor of two ) with that of the solid lines in the leftmost panel of figure  [ igmangmod2 ] .",
    "this argument may also hold for the whim , which would limit scatter broadening in the whim to no more than of order @xmath102as at 1 ghz .",
    "a similar limit holds if , conversely , @xmath75 : @xmath103    however , a counterargument to the applicability of the foregoing limits is that the scattering likely does not occur in such diffuse regions , but instead originates in overdense regions associated with the outer halos of galaxies .",
    "indeed , @xcite argues that a large fraction of the total intergalactic electron column along any line of sight emanates from galaxy halos ( see fig.1 of @xcite ) : a line of sight from a quasar at @xmath7 is likely to pass within the virial radius of at least one @xmath9 system , and the line of sight to a @xmath8 system is likely to pass within the virial radius of at least one @xmath104 system .",
    "the physical constraints implied by the balance of igm heating and cooling do not apply to such regions .",
    "one might expect a characteristic outer scale of @xmath105kpc , which yields a rough estimate of the magnitude of angular broadening of @xmath106 @xmath107 where we normalise to a density of @xmath108@xmath109 ( equivalent to @xmath90 ) to reflect the fact that the electron density in these regions is expected to far exceed the average density of the diffuse component of the igm .",
    "a similar argument can be applied to intracluster gas , where agn jets / outflows and galaxy dynamics can inject energy into ( or stir ) the cluster gas on scales of @xmath110 kpc .",
    "the strongest constraints for angular broadening in the igm can be obtained from the most compact extragalactic radio sources known to date  gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) compact enough to exhibit interstellar scintillation ( iss ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the angular size of the source of the radio afterglow of grb 970508 to be @xmath111as at 8.4 ghz based on observed diffractive iss of the source .",
    "the 5 ghz microarcsecond scintillation induced variability ( masiv ) survey of 443 compact agns found a decrease in the fraction of sources displaying iss and their scintillation amplitudes above @xmath112 @xcite , hinting at the possibility of increased angular broadening in the igm for the high redshift sources .",
    "however , dual - frequency follow - up observations of a sub - sample of 128 sources found no significant evidence of scatter broadening in the igm up to @xmath113 @xcite , constraining the value of @xmath78 due to the igm to @xmath114as at 5 ghz and the sm to @xmath115 towards the most compact @xmath116as objects .",
    "this constraint on @xmath78 is extrapolated to frequencies ranging from 50 mhz to 10 ghz ( gray line ) in figure  [ igmangconst ] , assuming kolmogorov turbulence in the igm where @xmath117 , so that @xmath118",
    ".        the observational constraints on scatter broadening in the igm are broadly consistent with our models and theoretical constraints from section  [ model ] for screen redshifts of @xmath91 , shown as black lines in figure  [ igmangconst ] .",
    "of particular interest is that the predicted scatter broadening in galaxy haloes appears to be larger than the upper limits from the masiv follow - up observations .",
    "although this could mean than @xmath34 in these regions are much larger than 1 kpc , or that scatter broadening in the outer regions of galaxy haloes are not significant , the more likely explanation is that the majority of sight - lines towards the most compact sources in the masiv follow - up observations do not intersect such galaxy haloes at @xmath25 .",
    "while @xcite predicts that most sight - lines will intersect within a virial radius of at least one such halo above a redshift of 0.5 or 1.4 ( depending on the halo mass ) , and the masiv follow - up sources have redshifts between 0 to 4 , @xmath78 can decrease by a few factors if the intervening halo is located at @xmath7 ( figure  [ igmangmod2 ] ) .",
    "this would then decrease the mean @xmath78 due to galaxy haloes to that comparable with or slightly below the upper limit imposed by the masiv observations , for such distributions of background source redshifts .",
    "the masiv follow - up observations are thus close to ruling out or confirming the predictions of @xcite .",
    "stronger constraints are needed , though the ultimate goal is to retrieve parameters such as @xmath34 , @xmath43 , @xmath119 and their redshift dependences for various components of the igm based on actual detections of scattering .",
    "we investigate in this section possible strategies for detecting and probing ( or at the very least place even stronger constraints on ) scatter broadening in the igm and other extragalactic structures such as cluster gas and galaxy haloes .",
    "one strategy for detecting angular broadening is to resolve compact background sources such as blazars with vlbi at multiple frequencies to determine if their angular sizes scale with @xmath120 , as was attempted by @xcite without success . in discussing the feasibility of using the ska to detect intergalactic scatter broadening",
    ", @xcite proposed that angular resolutions better than 4 mas at 1.4 ghz and 80 mas at 0.33 ghz are required .",
    "an extrapolation of the constraints from the masiv follow - up observations gives lower values of @xmath121as at 1.4 ghz and @xmath122 mas at 0.33 ghz .",
    "our model shows that it could be even much lower for the whim , with @xmath123as at 1 ghz for @xmath124 mpc .",
    "figure  [ igmangconst ] demonstrates that even with baselines comparable to the diameter of the earth ( 12,700 km ) , scatter broadening will be barely resolved down to frequencies as low as 50 mhz .",
    "this is based only on the strongest observational limits to date , so is true for the majority of sight - lines at least . if the sources intersect regions of overdensities comparable to @xmath22 at @xmath91 , which are more rare , ground - based telescopes may be able to resolve the scatter broadening at frequencies below @xmath125 mhz , provided that the outer scales of turbulence in these regions are of order kpc scales as expected for galaxy haloes .",
    "space vlbi has the best potential for directly resolving extragalactic scatter broadening .",
    "figure  [ igmangconst ] shows that for an overdense region of @xmath126 at @xmath91 with @xmath127 kpc as assumed for intracluster gas , scatter broadening can be resolved below frequencies of @xmath128 200 mhz and @xmath128 800 mhz for baselines between ground stations and stations in geosynchronous orbits ( up to @xmath128 84,000 km ) and that between ground stations and stations with moon - like orbits ( @xmath128 350,000 km ) , respectively .",
    "the radioastron telescope , which at perigee can form baselines of @xmath128 350,000 km with a ground based telescope , can thus already place very strong constraints on @xmath34 in cluster gas , provided it can detect sufficiently compact objects behind such structures .",
    "it can also test more strongly the suggestion by @xcite that intergalactic scattering will be dominated by regions close to haloes and will be important for most sight lines above a sufficiently high redshift , or place strong constraints on @xmath34 in such a scenario , for frequencies @xmath129 ghz .",
    "however , the contribution of the whim with @xmath130 to angular broadening appears undetectable even with the baselines of radioastron .    since scattering will be strongest through sight - lines intersecting the most dense and highly turbulent intergalactic structures , we propose targeted observations of compact extragalactic radio sources known to be intersected by galaxy haloes where @xmath131 and @xmath132 kpc ( perhaps even @xmath128 1 to 100 pc as observed in the milky way @xcite ) and rich clusters ( as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "one could envision an experiment using radioastron to observe a sample of sufficiently bright compact extragalactic radio sources in the background of a rich cluster of galaxies , or a sample of radio - loud quasars known to be intersected by mg ii and damped ly@xmath17 absorbers to determine if their angular sizes scale with @xmath120 , particularly for intervening objects at @xmath133 .",
    "this will allow the turbulence of the ionized medium within these objects , including @xmath34 , to be probed or more strongly constrained , particularly since @xmath66 can be determined from observations at optical and higher frequencies .",
    "these high angular resolution radio observations also provide a good follow - up of candidate detections of whim absorption lines at x - ray frequencies to constrain the turbulence in the whim , and confirm our predictions .",
    "one such whim candidate is the detection of an @xmath134 absorption line at a redshift of @xmath135 with estimated overdensities of @xmath3 in the x - ray spectrum of the bl lac object b2356 - 309 @xcite , with a source redshift @xmath136 0.1651 .",
    "since the search for these x - ray absorption lines tend to focus on bl lac objects due their featureless spectra , it is likely that these sources will have very compact cores at radio frequencies .",
    "by far the greatest impediment is that angular broadening will be dominated by contributions from the ism of our galaxy , the effects of which will be difficult to disentangle from that of the igm . even for igm screens at @xmath91 where the rest - frame frequency is equal to the observing frequency , the higher density and most likely smaller @xmath34 of the ism , together with the lever arm effect will favour the ism .",
    "such observations will therefore need to be carried out off the galactic plane .",
    "another option is to subtract the galactic contribution to angular broadening through observations of the angular broadening of pulsars close to the line - of - sight of the target agn , as has been proposed by @xcite , or through empirical models of the galactic electron distribution , e.g. ne2001 @xcite . while it is well - known that the ne2001 model has larger uncertainties at higher galactic latitudes , future pulsar and variability surveys with next generation radio telescopes such as the ska and its precursors will enable studies of temporal smearing of a larger sample of pulsars , as well as interstellar scintillation of large numbers of both galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "these will facilitate the construction of more accurate galactic scattering models , allowing us to better discriminate between galactic and extragalactic contributions to angular broadening .",
    "furthermore , radioastron ( and space vlbi in general , due to practical considerations ) is limited by its relatively low sensitivity with its 10 m antenna , being able to detect only sources with very high brightness temperature .",
    "studies of igm scatter broadening with space vlbi must thus be complemented by alternative methods that can probe angular broadening of fainter background sources , which we discuss next .",
    "interstellar scintillation ( iss ) provides a potent means of detecting igm scatter broadening in compact agn .",
    "the characteristic frequency dependence of the scintillations can be used to distinguish between the @xmath120 size dependence characteristic of angular broading and other source size effects intrinsic to the agn themselves .",
    "iss is sensitive to the presence ( or absence ) of structure within a source on angular scales of @xmath137as , and measurement of the amplitude of the intra - day variability at two frequencies is sufficient to ascertain if the source size is dominated by angular broadening .",
    "this method was first implemented by @xcite on a @xmath138-member sample of compact agn as a follow - up to the masiv survey @xcite .",
    "a summary of the technique , as applied to a sufficiently large sample of agn that it is ammenable to statistical analysis , is as follows .    from the point of view of the ism turbulence responsible for the iss ,",
    "the radio sources have an apparent angular size of : @xmath139 where @xmath78 is the scatter broadening contribution by the igm .",
    "we assume that the observations are conducted at sufficiently high galactic latitudes so that scatter broadening in the ism before the radio waves arrive at the interstellar scintillation screen is small or negligible .",
    "the population of background sources is modeled such that they are intrinsically limited to some fixed brightness temperature @xmath140k ( e.g.due to energy equipartition of the magnetic fields and electrons @xcite ) so that one has @xmath141}^{0.5 } \\\\ & \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\cdot { \\left ( \\dfrac{\\nu}{5 \\,{\\rm ghz}}\\right)}^{-1 } { \\left [    \\left ( \\dfrac{t_{\\rm{b , int}}}{10^{11}\\,{\\rm k}}\\right)\\left ( \\dfrac{\\gamma}{15}\\right)\\right]}^{-0.5 }    \\ , , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 is the observed flux density at observing frequency @xmath143 , @xmath144 is the doppler boosting factor due to beaming from bulk relativistic motion within the source , @xmath145 is the speed of light and @xmath146 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we introduce the parameter , @xmath147 , which we define as the ratio of the variance of agn scintillation amplitudes at two observing frequencies , given as : @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the variances of the flux density variations exhibited by the source at 8.4ghz and 5ghz respectively .",
    "we suggest forming a ratio between the variations near these particular frequencies since weak iss tends to have the largest amplitudes at these frequencies at mid - galactic latitudes @xcite ; however , the technique is in principle ammenable to any pair of frequencies at which the scintillations can be modelled .",
    "since the iss amplitudes are dependent on the angular sizes of the sources at these two frequencies , @xmath147 is dependent on the scaling of source angular size with frequency , and this enables igm angular broadening effects to be distinguished from intrinsic source size effects ( which typically scale as @xmath151 ) .",
    "while iss is also dependent on other parameters of the ism such as the scattering screen velocity and the distance between the observer and the scattering screen , these parameters are removed to first order when one calculates @xmath147 for each source separately .",
    "a practical complication arises because the measurements of source variability span a finite duration and are obtained at discrete intervals , so that in practice one uses the amplitude of the flux density structure function on a timescale @xmath152 , @xmath153 , as a surrogate for the variance ; one therefore actually computes @xmath154    one computes the expected value of @xmath155 based on a given model of the ism , in conjunction with fitting functions that yield the expected amplitude of iss , as provided by @xcite .",
    "these functions take into account the scintillation response to the finite angular source size in addition to the expected decrement in variability amplitude between 5 and 8.4ghz due to the decrease in scattering strength .",
    "one typically assumes an effective scattering screen distance of @xmath156pc , a transition frequency between weak and strong iss of @xmath157ghz , and a characteristic scintillation speed of @xmath158 .",
    "however , @xmath155 is not significantly dependent on some of these parameters of the ism scattering screen .",
    "figure  [ issresolve](a ) shows how @xmath159 ) varies with the 5 ghz source flux densities , @xmath160 , for different magnitudes of scatter broadening in the igm at 5 ghz .",
    "corresponding changes in @xmath161 ( black curves ) and @xmath162 ( blue curves ) with @xmath163 are also shown in figure  [ issresolve](c ) .",
    "changes in @xmath164 at 5 ghz ( black curves ) and 8.4 ghz ( blue curves ) with @xmath163 are shown in figure  [ issresolve](d ) . here",
    ", we have used @xmath165 and @xmath166 , but again these values , although they affect @xmath153 and @xmath164 at both frequencies , do not significantly affect @xmath155 that is computed on a source by source basis , assuming that @xmath144 is independent of frequency .",
    "typically , when @xmath167 , the value of @xmath155 approaches a constant value @xmath168 , as seen for @xmath169 in figure  [ issresolve](a ) when @xmath170 mjy ( @xmath171as ) .",
    "as @xmath172 increases with increasing @xmath163 , @xmath155 is expected to decrease until it approaches a typical value of @xmath173 for @xmath174 .",
    "however , in figure  [ issresolve](a ) , above @xmath175 jy , @xmath176 increases as the source mean flux density ( and @xmath172 ) increases .",
    "this is because @xmath164 is sufficiently large that the characteristic time - scales of iss are longer than 4 days , so that @xmath177 at both frequencies do not saturate as expected for a stationary stochastic process , with @xmath178 rising faster than @xmath179 as a function of @xmath152 , due to slightly smaller angular sizes and shorter scintillation timescales at 8.4 ghz relative to 5 ghz .",
    "this effect can be mitigated by increasing the observational period and using @xmath180 so that the structure functions of the lightcurves at both frequencies saturate , and @xmath155 is essentially a constant for large values of @xmath160 ( as shown in figure  [ issresolve](b ) for @xmath181 .",
    "alternatively , these larger values of @xmath155 due to @xmath182 not saturating can be distinguished from large @xmath155 values typical of sources where scatter broadening dominates by using the observed @xmath182 and @xmath152 at both frequencies as additional model constraints .    in the analysis of data obtained from the masiv follow - up observations , the values of @xmath178 and @xmath179 were calculated at a timescale of @xmath183days using the model of @xcite and compared with measured values of @xmath176 based on structure functions measured with the same 4-day time lag .",
    "the masiv observations provided no significant detection of igm scatter broadening down to the @xmath116as level at 5 ghz using a sample of agn with mean flux densities @xmath184mjy ( shown also in figure  [ issresolve](a ) ) .",
    "this flux density limit is important , because it means that the masiv survey and its follow - up observations were constrained to probe relatively large values of @xmath172 , as suggested by equation  [ brightnesstemp ] .",
    "we note that the error bars for the data points in figure  [ issresolve](a ) are 99% confidence intervals for @xmath176 , obtained from fits to @xmath185 in the paper by @xcite . only sources at @xmath186 were considered , giving a sample of 29 sources at @xmath125 mjy and 19 sources at @xmath4 jy , which contributes to the large error bars .",
    "the observed inverse correlation of iss amplitudes with mean flux densities in the masiv survey @xcite implies that these scintillating agn cores indeed may be brightness temperature - limited .",
    "therefore , lower flux density sources tend to have smaller intrinsic source sizes and are more likely to be dominated by scatter broadening",
    ". scatter broadening between @xmath4 to @xmath187as scales is not measurable for sources with flux densities of @xmath188mjy , whose angular diameters are dominated by their instrinsic size .",
    "the effects of these lower levels of scatter broadening begin to significantly affect @xmath164 and @xmath189 at both frequencies for @xmath190 mjy ( @xmath191as ) . since there is still a factor of @xmath192 increase in the value of @xmath193 from @xmath194 to @xmath195as , @xmath78 can still be probed between these values for sources with flux densities @xmath196 mjy . for @xmath197as ,",
    "@xmath198 no longer deviates significantly from that where the source is not scatter broadened at all , since @xmath78 will never dominate at @xmath199jy ( @xmath200as ) .",
    "iss observations of @xmath128 1 mjy or even @xmath201jy sources with a highly sensitive instrument such as the ska has the potential to probe angular sizes at much higher resolution , allowing lower level scatter broadening to be detected . for a full ska sensitivity of @xmath202 as specified by @xcite , the array would be able to probe @xmath203 variations in a 100 @xmath204jy source at @xmath205 levels with a bandwidth of 350 mhz and an integration time of 1 minute per pointing .",
    "assuming that the ska will be divided into two subarrays to observe the variability simultaneously at 2 frequencies , @xmath206 minutes is required per pointing to achieve these sensitivity levels .",
    "in fact , the upgraded jansky very large array ( jvla ) can already significantly improve upon what was achieved by the masiv follow - up observations . with its wider bandwidth",
    ", the jvla can observe @xmath203 variations in a 10 mjy source at @xmath205 levels ( assuming a 1 ghz bandwidth ) with @xmath128 1 minute integrations per pointing .",
    "again , this assumes the sensitivity of only half the array , with 13 antennas , so that the other half is observing at another frequency simultaneously .",
    "this means that a similar experiment to that of the masiv follow - up observations can be carried out for 10 mjy sources with no increase in observing time ( 140 sources observed per sidereal day over 11 days ) . for 5 mjy sources , 3 minutes per pointing",
    "is required to achieve the required sensitivity .",
    "the flexibility of the widar correlator allows the tuning of two separate 1 ghz bands to two different center frequencies within each receiver band , allowing two sub - arrays to observe iss at 4 centre frequencies ( e.g. , 5 , 6.5 , 8 and 10 ghz ) , to obtain @xmath207 from different combinations of frequency pairs for comparisons with the models .",
    "alternatively , each subarray can observe at only a single centre frequency with a contiguous bandwidth of @xmath208 ghz to increase the sensitivity and reduce the observing time or observe a larger source sample .",
    "observing weaker sources , with @xmath209jy will not improve the sensitivity towards angular broadening on scales of @xmath210as or lower .",
    "the reason is that the apparent angular size of the source , @xmath164 , as it appears to the scattering screen responsible for iss drops below the fresnel scale , the scale at which the scintillations exhibit the effects of a perfectly point - like source in the weak iss regime , and below which the iss amplitudes are no longer dependent on the angular size .",
    "this is demonstrated by comparing figures  [ issresolve](c ) and [ issresolve](d ) in the cases where @xmath211 and 1 @xmath204as . for @xmath190 mjy , @xmath189 at both frequencies have saturated even though @xmath164 continues to decrease with decreasing @xmath160 .",
    "@xmath198 also decreases with decreasing @xmath160 and saturates at @xmath212 below 1 mjy , and is no longer dependent on the frequency scaling of @xmath164 , but on the angular size of the fresnel zone of the ism scattering screen , which scales as @xmath213 .",
    "this is the same reason why @xmath198 will never approach @xmath168 for @xmath214as , even when scatter broadening completely dominates at @xmath215jy .",
    "the fresnel scale is @xmath216as at 5 ghz for our chosen screen distance of 500 pc .",
    "the model therefore demonstrates that while such an experiment with a sensitive radio array improves the resolution at which scatter broadening may be probed by weak iss , the fresnel scale of the ism scattering screen places a physical limit below which this is no longer possible .",
    "even though iss surveys of low flux density sources can place more than an order of magnitude stronger constraints on igm scattering compared to space vlbi ( figure  [ igmangconst ] ) at @xmath217 ghz frequencies , we are still not able to detect the whim at its typical overdensities of @xmath89 even if @xmath34 has an unlikely low value of @xmath4 kpc .",
    "if indeed the contribution to @xmath78 from galaxy haloes is important through most lines of sight for sources at sufficiently high @xmath218 , as suggested by @xcite , instruments such as the ska will also be able to test this , since equation  [ thetahaloes ] gives @xmath219as at 5 ghz for @xmath124 kpc .",
    "there are still advantages to using the ska for such observations .",
    "its higher sensitivity and survey speeds greatly improves the statistics relative to that of the masiv survey and follow - up observations .",
    "the ska will also be able to detect scintillation at a much lower level in the sources , allowing more accurate estimates of @xmath207 in sources that scintillate less .",
    "the main reason for the small source sample used in obtaining @xmath207 for the masiv follow - up observations ( figure  [ issresolve](a ) ) , is the fact that @xmath207 can only be estimated to sufficient accuracy when @xmath220 above the noise levels at both frequencies . through",
    "proposed synoptic variability surveys @xcite , the ska will thus be able to reduce the sizes of the error bars ( which for the weak @xmath204jy and mjy sources will be dominated by errors due to thermal noise and confusion effects in determining @xmath182 ) .",
    "such surveys will also increase the redshifts to which these compact scintillating sources can be detected , as well as the number of sources that can be observed at high redshift , to determine if scatter broadening in the igm causes a redshift dependence in agn iss .",
    "we note in passing that targeted observations of compact radio sources intersected by cluster gas and intervening absorption systems , as proposed in section  [ directimaging ] , are equally amenable to the method described here . in this case",
    ", we are probing the @xmath221 ghz regimes of scatter broadening in these structures , inaccessible to space vlbi which can test our models only at frequencies @xmath196 ghz ( see figure  [ igmangconst ] ) .",
    "the disadvantage of the ska , however , is that many of these compact , flat - spectrum sources will likely contain components that will be resolved by the longest baselines of the array .",
    "this results in additional variability as these complex structures rotate relative to the array , increasing the systematic errors . removing the longest baselines from the ska when conducting such observations",
    "effectively also reduces its sensitivity .",
    "other subsidiary challenges in resolving igm angular broadening using iss arise from :    1 .",
    "the difficulty of discriminating iss from intrinsic source variability .",
    "this can be done for large samples at a statistical level through correlation with line - of - sight h@xmath17 intensities .",
    "for individual sources however , annual cycles , time - delays between widely separated telescopes , or correlations with variability in the optical and gamma - ray regimes will be required to remove contributions from intrinsic variability .",
    "2 .   the limitation of having to carry out these observations at ghz frequencies where iss is strongest and most rapid at mid - galactic latitudes ( as compared to time - scales of months and years below 1 ghz ) , but where @xmath78 is smaller than that at lower frequencies . 3 .",
    "the fact that at the lower end of the flux density scale , below mjy levels , starburst galaxies with more extended radio emission regions begin to dominate the population of radio sources , rather than radio - loud agns @xcite .",
    "in this paper we estimate the angular broadening of a compact continuum radio source due to various components of the igm for a range of source and scattering screen redshifts .",
    "the models are based on an extension of the thin screen scattering model of the ism to cosmological scales , assuming kolmogorov turbulence for the igm .",
    "the model predictions were used together with observational constraints obtained from the most compact extragalactic sources known to discuss the feasibility and prospects of detecting scatter broadening in the igm .",
    "the main conclusions can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "angular broadening is dominated by the nearest , @xmath25 screens ( including the ism of our galaxy ) , for scattering screens with fixed proper densities . for scattering screens",
    "whose densities are coupled to the hubble flow , the most efficient scattering occurs at screen redshifts of one half that of the source .",
    "angular broadening in the igm can barely be resolved with ground - based interferometers , and can only be detected below 800mhz at space vlbi baselines of @xmath222 km for sight - lines through regions of overdensity @xmath126 , for fully developed kolmogorov turbulence with @xmath223 kpc .",
    "there is thus a strong case for conducting targeted observations to detect angular broadening of compact background sources intersected by rich clusters of galaxies ( as initially proposed by @xcite ) and foreground galaxy haloes ( briefly considered by @xcite ) to probe the turbulence of the icm and ism of these objects . for the whim with @xmath224 ,",
    "angular broadening can not be detected using space vlbi and iss even if the outer scales of turbulence have an unlikely low value of @xmath4 kpc .",
    "multi - frequency surveys of interstellar scintillation of compact extragalactic radio sources with @xmath5jy flux densities using the ska can potentially detect or place even stronger constraints on igm scatter broadening down to @xmath2as levels at 5 ghz .",
    "if sight - lines to sources at @xmath7 and @xmath8 likely intersect regions within a virial radius of a galaxy halo of @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively @xcite , angular broadening can be of order @xmath5as at 1 ghz and @xmath6as at 5 ghz for @xmath124 kpc through most sight - lines above such redshifts . while this lies close to the strongest observational upper limits to date , both space vlbi and multi - wavelength iss observations with the ska can easily test this scenario , or place strong constraints on @xmath34 of such regions .",
