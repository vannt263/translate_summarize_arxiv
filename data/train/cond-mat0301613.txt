    "the clausius - mossotti@xcite polarization equation of state is quite often discussed in text books on electromagnetic theory@xcite .",
    "the discussion is thought to give students a good physical idea about how microscopic models of dipole moments yield non - trivial macroscopic material dielectric constants @xmath0 .",
    "it is only sometimes mentioned that the clausius - mossotti model exhibits an instability hinting at a phase transition into an ordered polarized state . the unstable precursor to the phase transition",
    "is in fact self evident .",
    "the instability is particularly strong in polar liquids such as water .",
    "in fact , the clausius - mossotti model in its classic text book form indicates that water at room temperature and pressure is in an ordered polarization state .",
    "the ordered state of polar liquids is described in the literature as exhibiting _",
    "superradiance_@xcite . in the superradiant state",
    ", the polarization @xmath1 has a mean value roughly constant in magnitude within an ordered domain .",
    "however , @xmath1 may vary in direction as one goes from one ordered fluid domain to another ordered fluid domain .",
    "the theoretical derivation of superradiant domains normally starts from condensed matter quantum electrodynamics .",
    "yet many insights into the nature of superradiant thermal equilibrium can be obtained from a classical electrodynamic viewpoint .",
    "our purpose is to derive the polar liquid phase transition implicit in the clausius - mossotti model .",
    "our arguments employ ( apart from classical electrodynamics ) the elementary statistical thermodynamics previously worked out by debye and langevin@xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly discuss the derivation of the clausius - mossotti _ local _ electric field ( in gaussian units ) @xmath2 in eq.([localfield ] ) , @xmath3 is the total electric field and @xmath1 is the dipole moment per unit volume . in terms of the molecular polarizability @xmath4 of a single molecule and the liquid volume @xmath5 per molecule , we shall derive the mean field clausius - mossotti dielectric constant @xmath6 . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the region of thermodynamic stability of the clausius - mossotti model .",
    "the known _ instability _ is often thought to be an _ embarrassment _ for the mean field theory .",
    "however , we argue that the clausius - mossotti instability is a signature of a physical phase transition into an ordered phase .",
    "the ordered phase has been previously discovered from the viewpoint of superradiance .",
    "the thermodynamic theories of both the ordered and disordered phases are discussed from the clausius - mossotti viewpoint in sec .",

    "the change in coulomb energy will be given in terms of the potential @xmath19 according to @xmath20 the electric field @xmath21 may then be computed from the functional variation @xmath22 the local electric field @xmath23 is due directly to the dipole - dipole interaction function @xmath24 in eq.([localfield6 ] ) via the variation @xmath25 the remaining @xmath26 term on the right hand side of eq.([localfield11 ] ) is due to the local polarization energy in eq.([localfield9 ] ) , i.e. @xmath27 eq.([localfield13 ] ) implies the clausius - mossotti local field eq.([localfield ] ) .",
    "now suppose that the individual fluid molecules exhibit a mean electric dipole moment response to a local field as described by the polarizability @xmath4 via @xmath28 the dipole moment per unit volume ( corresponding to a volume @xmath5 per molecule of fluid ) then reads @xmath29 thus @xmath30 with a polarization susceptibility @xmath31 in terms of the dielectric constant @xmath6 , @xmath32 one finds the clausius - mossotti prediction @xmath33 all that is needed to calculate @xmath6 ( in this model ) is the polarizability @xmath4 for an isolated molecule and the volume per molecule @xmath5 in the fluid .",
    "landau and lifshitz@xcite prove a non - trivial theorem in their treatise on the electrodynamics of continuous media .",
    "the theorem asserts that the dielectric constant of a material obeys the inequality @xmath34 we note ( in passing ) that the magnetic analogue of the theorem ( with @xmath35 ) asserts only the weaker magnetic permeability inequality @xmath36 .",
    "thus , diamagnetism ( @xmath37 ) can exist but diaelectricity ( @xmath38 ) can not exist . if one applies the thermodynamic stability criteria of the landau - lifshitz eq.([thermalstability1 ] ) to the clausius - mossotti eq.([localfield19 ] ) , then it becomes apparent that the region of stability for the model may be described by the parameter @xmath39    debye defines a _ polar molecule _ as one whose polarizability has a temperature dependence ( in the dilute gas phase ) of the form @xmath40 by plotting @xmath41 as a function of inverse temperature one finds a linear slope yielding the magnitude of a `` permanent '' dipole moment @xmath42 if the polarizability of a single molecule ( say in the gas phase ) exhibits an appreciable permanent dipole moment @xmath43 , then the molecule is called polar . the water molecule @xmath44 is an important example of a polar molecule . in the dilute gas phase ,",

    "many other polar liquids also tend to be in unstable regimes . in their studies of polar liquids ,",

    "the polarization equation of state in the langevin - clausius - mossotti model is of the typical `` mean field '' variety",
    ". there exists a critical temperature @xmath78 above the critical temperature , the susceptibility is positive , @xmath79 in accordance with the landau - lifshitz eq.([thermalstability1 ] ) .",
    "below the critical temperature , there is an unphysical `` @xmath80 '' portion of an equation of state loop which must be subject to an `` equal area '' construction@xcite to deduce the proper stable phase .",
    "there exists below the critical temperature a remnant polarization @xmath81 the parametric equations for the remnant polarization are given by @xmath82 where the parameter range is @xmath83 .",
    "the ordered phase of the langevin - clausius - mossotti polar liquid is ferroelectric with a polarization pointing in a unit vector direction @xmath84 .",
    "the magnitude of the remnant polarization is plotted in fig .",
    "2 .    in this picture ,",
    "water at room temperature contains ordered ferroelectric domains with a polarization pointing in the direction @xmath67 . from one domain to another",
    ", the direction @xmath67 of the polarization is changing .",
    "the situation is shown schematically in fig .",
    "3 . inside of a domain",
    ", there is a residual local electric field @xmath85 and polarization @xmath58 related by @xmath86    the domain picture has many interesting features only one of which we shall discuss here . if one asks what will happen to a noble gas impurity ( say argon ) when it is dissolved in water , then one concludes that the atom will be drawn inside the ordered domain .",
    "the effective potential@xcite on the atom is ( roughly ) a step function attracting the impurity into the ordered domain , @xmath87 in fig .",
    "3 we show two of the domains with an impurity .",
    "the notion that an ordered domain is clustered around a dissolved noble gas atom ( say argon ) has consequences for the thermodynamic impurity equations of state .",
    "the impurity entropy has in fact been particularly well analyzed by frank and evans@xcite .",
    "suppose that a dilute mixture of argon in water is such that the vapor phase mixture is in thermal equilibrium with the dilute liquid mixture .",
    "an impurity atom in water vapor is in a disordered environment .",
    "the impurity atom in liquid water will be found in an ordered environment within a domain .",
    "impurity entropy is then _ lost _ when the impurity atom moves from the vapor to the liquid . to use the words of frank and evans ( describing this unexpected entropy loss )",
    "`` the water builds a microscopic iceberg around the non - polar molecule '' .",
    "there is no evidence that an ordered domain about a noble gas atom impurity is a piece of ice .",
    "the low entropy polarized domain predicted by the langevin - clausius - mossotti model appears to explain the so called `` iceberg effect '' .",
    "the clausius - mossotti model together with the elementary statistical thermodynamics of debye and langevin yields a ferroelectric phase transition for many polar liquids including water .",
    "the notion of ferroelectric domains within the a polar liquid with a net polarization @xmath58 and internal electric field @xmath88 is clearly implicit in the model and can be derived above in a fairly simple and straight forward manner .",
    "the phase transition may be described using basic concepts from elementary physics .    nevertheless , reasoning with classical electrodynamics and classical statistical thermodynamics yields only partial insights concerning the complete microscopic theory .",
    "a detailed theory involves quantum statistical mechanics and quantum electrodynamics .",
    "for example , why does a polar @xmath44 molecule have a permanent electric dipole moment ?",
    "if one starts by calculating the quantum ground state @xmath89 of the molecule employing only the non - relativistic coulomb hamiltonian , then parity conservation requires the vanishing of the mean dipole moment @xmath90 .",
    "the notion of a permanent electric dipole moment requires a break in parity ( space inversion ) symmetry .",
    "such a symmetry break can come about due to interactions with the quantum electrodynamic field .",
    "similarly , the dipole - dipole interaction takes place ( in the quantum electrodynamic theory ) due to the exchange of virtual photons between two dipoles .    that the polarized domains have a net internal electric field @xmath85 , really means that the exchanged photons form a bose condensate .",
    "the bose condensate is also present in a model conventionally used to describe superradiance@xcite . in spite of the long time popularity of the clausius - mossotti model",
    ", it was only through a study of superradiance that the ordered domains were first@xcite theoretically discovered .",
    "it is hoped that the above simple clausius - mossotti model considerations serve to clarify the mechanism for ordering in some polar liquids .",
