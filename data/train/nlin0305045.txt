    "many turbulent flows are characterized by time dependent forcing .",
    "e.g. the atmosphere of the earth is driven by the heating through the radiation from the sun , the blood flow in the arteries by the heart beats , etc .",
    "also technical flows like the flow in the intake of a combustion engine are periodically forced .",
    "another example are estuaries and adjacent coastal waters , where tidal straining leads to a periodic alternation of stratification and turbulent mixing of saline and fresh water @xcite .",
    "this results in a periodically varying energy dissipation in the upper water layers with a 12 hour period .",
    "the effect of a periodically increasing and decreasing energy input on turbulent flow depends on the frequency of the driving .",
    "this has been studied in reference @xcite for a turbulent channel flow where the modulations of the input rate are generated near the wall .",
    "it was found that for high frequencies these oscillations are strongly damped with distance from the walls , such that they do not reach the inner part of the logarithmic boundary layer .",
    "another example is rayleigh - benard convection : the interaction between the large scale circulating flow and the thermal plumes detaching from the upper and the lower boundary layers acts as a stochastically influenced time - dependent forcing on the turbulent flow in the inner region of the cell , as recently shown in @xcite . in a von krmn flow between two coaxial corotating disks @xcite ,",
    "the energy input rate is not constant if the disks are kept rotating at constant speed , but is periodically varying with a geometry - dependent frequency due to a coherent vortex precessing around the axis of rotation . in this case",
    "it was also shown , that the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations are affected by the time dependence of the mean flow .",
    "however , the averaged velocity power spectrum still shows kolmogorov scaling over a broad frequency range , in addition to a low frequency peak corresponding to the oscillation of the mean flow .",
    "these results raise the question how global quantities of a turbulent flow , like e.g. the total energy or the reynolds number , respond to a time dependent energy input .",
    "this problem is the subject of the present paper . from a more fundamental point of view , studying modulated turbulence will give more insight into the time scales in particular of the turbulent energy cascade .    in a previous study @xcite ,",
    "the time evolution of the reynolds number in a periodically kicked flow was analyzed .",
    "if the kicking strength and the kicking frequency are large enough , the reynolds number grows and saturates on a level , which depends on the frequency and the kicking strength .",
    "the theoretical results from @xcite have later been verified numerically in reference @xcite .    in this present paper",
    ", we study a related type of forcing . rather than periodically kicking the boundary conditions of homogeneous , isotropic turbulence as in @xcite , we force the flow through a time - dependent modulation of the energy input rate @xmath3 on the outer length scale @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath5 this means that the flow is stationarily stirred ( @xmath6 ) to maintain the turbulent flow and , in addition , a time - dependent modulation of the forcing ( @xmath7 ) is applied , @xmath8 .",
    "the response of the system to the time - dependent stirring can be observed e.g. in the second order velocity structure function of the flow field , in particular at the outer scale @xmath4 , @xmath9 . this @xmath10 is equivalent to a reynolds number , which we define as @xmath11 .",
    "here , @xmath12 is the rms of one component of the velocity , varying with time @xmath13 .",
    "then , disregarding correlations on scale @xmath4 , @xmath14    the energy put into the system at time @xmath13 will travel down the energy cascade towards smaller scales and will , on average , be dissipated at time @xmath15 , i.e. , with a mean time delay @xmath16 . in other words ,",
    "the dissipation at time @xmath13 depends on how much energy has been in the large scales at time @xmath17 .",
    "we approximately describe the relevant time scale @xmath16 for the cascade process by the large eddy turnover time @xmath18 at that time @xmath17 , @xmath19 more accurately , the time scale of the energy cascade is given by the sum over the eddy turnover times on all decay steps , @xmath20 . in this sum , the largest contribution is the largest eddy turnover time @xmath18 . for k41 scaling the smaller eddies @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , have turnover times @xmath23 .",

    "putting into intermittency corrections gives slightly smaller values of @xmath27 . in this present paper",
    "we shall discuss the influence of @xmath27 by comparing the limiting cases @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "experimentally , in principle the parameter @xmath27 could be measured by analyzing the positions , heights and widths of the response maxima , thus giving information about the energy cascade time .",
    "if the external modulation period @xmath30 is much larger than this intrinsic time scale @xmath16 , @xmath31 , the turbulent flow will have time to adjust and will follow the periodic variations of the stirring . if , on the other hand , @xmath30 is decreased and becomes much smaller than @xmath16 , the system can follow less and less , and feels , at small scales , an average time - independent energy input .",
    "we calculate the time dependence of the response @xmath32 to a periodically modulated energy input rate , eq .",

    "therefore , the cascade time as well as the response of the system are fluctuating .",
    "these fluctuations are neglected by the mean - field theory in the present study . however , on average these fluctuations result in a mean downscale transport of energy which controls the overall properties of the flow .",

    "the system follows the input rate modulation whereas for high frequencies the amplitude of the response decreases @xmath246 . due to the intrinsic time scale of the system , the eddy - turnover time @xmath16 , which also characterizes the energy transport time down the eddy cascade , there are certain frequencies , @xmath247 , where the amplitude of the response is either increased or decreased . at these frequencies",

    "this can be understood as a very effective transport of energy through the system . at the amplitude minima , instead , the response of the system is strongly reduced .",

    "are neglected . in experiment or numerical simulation",

    "are expected to become more significant due to the better signal to fluctuation ratio . but remember that for higher modulation amplitudes @xmath91 , the time scale of the eddy cascade , which enters into our model as a time delay , becomes time dependent .",
    "this as well could lead to less pronounced response maxima as discussed in section [ tauapprox ] .    a way to check",
    "if the characteristic feature of the response maxima and minima can still be well identified under the influence of fluctuations , would be to perform numerical simulations of the navier stokes equation with a modulated driving .",
    "however , as not only high reynolds numbers are needed to achieve fully developed , isotropic and homogeneous turbulence , but also the response as a function of time for a wide range of frequencies has to be calculated , the computational effort would be too high .",

    "@xcite showed evidence for the existence of the response maxima",
    ". this experiment may be comparable with our study of a modulated driving force as discussed in section [ modf ] .",
    "the response maxima were measured in the amplitude of the energy input rate .",
    "in addition , a constant response amplitude for low driving frequencies and a @xmath107-decay of the velocity response amplitude for large frequencies has been observed .",
