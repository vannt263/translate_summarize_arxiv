    "when it seemed that all questions concerning the packing and covering properties of disks in the plane had been asked ( and in many cases answered ) , naoki inaba @xcite proposed a new one that , although easy to state , appears to be quite hard .",
    "consider a two - player game where the first player places @xmath1 points in the plane .",
    "after all the points are placed , the second player tries to cover all the points with unit radius disks .",
    "although the number of disks is unlimited , they may not overlap .",
    "the first player is declared the winner if the second player can not cover all @xmath1 points .",
    "problem : what is the minimum @xmath1 for which the first player has a winning strategy ?    this problem combines elements of covering and packing optimization .",
    "the challenge is to design point sets of size @xmath1 that are difficult to cover with unit disks , when the disks are constrained to form a packing . a good indicator of the difficulty of this problem is the large gap between the lower and upper bounds , on the minimum size design that can not be covered , that can be obtained with a reasonable effort . in this paper",
    "we establish the bounds @xmath2 .",
    "while both bounds are certainly poor , we submit them nevertheless as evidence of the difficulty of this problem .",
    "the first player faces a challenge even when the second player is given a significant handicap .",
    "consider the handicap where the disks are required to form a close packing of the plane .",
    "the disk centers will always lie on the points of the hexagonal lattice @xmath3 with minimum distance 2 , or more generally , a translation of @xmath3 by a vector @xmath4 . the second player , in this restricted form of play , is limited to selecting the translation @xmath4 such that disks centered at @xmath5 cover as many of the first player s points as possible .",
    "owing to the translation symmetry of @xmath3 , both @xmath4 and the points played by the first player should be treated as elements of the fundamental domain @xmath6 .",
    "clearly the minimum number of points @xmath7 that can not be covered by the second player with this handicap , given optimal play by the first player , is a lower bound on the number @xmath1 we seek for games without the handicap .",
    "our lower bound is based on properties of the _ interstitium _ , the space @xmath8 between the disks in a close packing .",
    "let @xmath9 be the unit disk centered on the origin , then @xmath10 is the interstitium of a translated close packing .",
    "[ 10thm ] any configuration of 10 points in the plane can be covered by a packing of unit disks .",
    "let @xmath11 be a winning set of points for the first player when the second player has the handicap of being restricted to translates of close packings ( such a set exists by theorem [ 55thm ] ) . because @xmath12 is a winning set there is no translation @xmath4 such that @xmath13 covers every point of @xmath12 , this last property being equivalent to @xmath14 for some @xmath15 .",
    "thus every candidate translation @xmath4 is in the interstitium of some point of the wining set .",
    "but this is possible only if the interstitia @xmath16 for @xmath15 cover @xmath17 .",
    "a necessary condition for this is @xmath18 from which we obtain @xmath19",
    "in this section we show that at least one point in the configuration of 55 points shown in figure 1 will not be covered in any packing arrangement of unit disks .",
    "our construction exploits properties of the disk of radius @xmath20 that fits snugly into the hole formed by three mutually tangent unit disks ( figure 2 )",
    ". we will refer to disks of this size as _",
    "holes_.     and @xmath21 and a hexagonal lattice of minimum distance @xmath22 gives a 55-point configuration that can not be covered by a packing of unit disks ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "points near the horizontal edges of the rectangle are in its exterior . ]",
    "a hole in a packing of unit disks is a disk of radius @xmath20 disjoint from any of the unit disks .",
    "[ adjacentholelemma ] let @xmath9 be a disk in a packing of unit disks and @xmath23 any arc of the circumference of @xmath9 having central angle @xmath24 , then a hole is tangent to @xmath9 somewhere along @xmath23 .",
    "consider configurations of holes tangent to @xmath9 ; their positions are constrained by the packing configuration of the other unit disks .",
    "let @xmath25 be the subset of the circumference of @xmath9 where holes can be tangent .",
    "a disk @xmath26 with distance @xmath27 from @xmath9 will exclude an open arc @xmath28 from @xmath25 when @xmath29 .",
    "the central angle of @xmath28 has the maximum value @xmath24 when @xmath30 .",
    "two excluded arcs @xmath28 and @xmath31 can not intersect because their intersection would be open and correspond to an open set of configurations where a hole is simultaneously tangent to three unit disks in a packing  which is ruled out by choice of the hole radius @xmath32 .",
    "the arcs excluded from @xmath25 are therefore disjoint and have maximum central angle @xmath24 .",
    "intersecting @xmath25 with any arc of @xmath9 with central angle @xmath24 will therefore include a point at which a hole is tangent .",
    "[ holeinrectanglelemma ] let @xmath33 be a rectangle with sides @xmath34 and @xmath21 , then in any packing of unit disks @xmath33 contains a hole .",
    "this argument relies on the construction shown in figure 3 , where @xmath33 is shown with vertices @xmath23 , @xmath35 , @xmath25 and @xmath9 and six holes are shown at special positions ( centers ) @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath39 within @xmath33 .",
    "the dimensions of @xmath33 follow from tangency conditions satisfied at these special positions .",
    "the center of @xmath33 is @xmath36 ; a unit disk placed there will be tangent to holes at @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath3 ( and also @xmath8 ) .",
    "tangency of hole @xmath37 with rectangle side @xmath40 determines the rectangle edge @xmath41 .",
    "holes @xmath38 and @xmath3 are also tangent to the unit disk placed at @xmath36 . requiring these to subtend angle @xmath24 at @xmath36 and to be tangent to the sides of the rectangle",
    "determines the other dimension of @xmath33 : @xmath42 .    .",
    "]    we will also need the two smaller rectangles , @xmath43 with vertices @xmath8 , @xmath36 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 with vertices @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath47 and @xmath1 .",
    "tangencies determine @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "rectangle @xmath43 is congruent to @xmath46 ; their union forms a square @xmath50 of side @xmath51 .",
    "it is easily checked that @xmath8 , @xmath39 and @xmath47 form the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side @xmath51 . a unit disk centered at @xmath47",
    "would thus be tangent to the holes at @xmath8 and @xmath39 and the angle subtended by the holes relative to @xmath47 will be @xmath24 .",
    "now consider any packing of unit disks and let @xmath27 be the minimum distance between @xmath36 and the disk centers .",
    "we may assume @xmath52 , since otherwise there is a hole at @xmath36 .",
    "without loss of generality we can assume the disk with distance @xmath27 has its center in the quadrant occupied by square @xmath50 , and for convenience we even allow it to lie anywhere within @xmath50 ( which contains the quarter circle of radius @xmath51 ) . to complete the proof we need to show that a unit disk centered anywhere in @xmath50 will always admit an arc of its circumference for potential hole tangencies with central angle no less than @xmath24 and such that the holes are always contained in @xmath33 . by lemma [ adjacentholelemma ] we then know that one of these holes will survive no matter how the other unit disks are packed .    first consider the case where the unit disk center lies in rectangle @xmath43 .",
    "the arc shown in figure 3 and centered at @xmath36 is an extreme point in the case we are considering here .",
    "this arc is continuously related to arcs at all other centers in @xmath43 .",
    "the significance of @xmath43 is that the arc endpoints , for disks centered in @xmath43 , are always determined by hole tangencies to sides @xmath53 and @xmath54 of @xmath33 . since the smallest arc arises when the centers of the two holes lie on a line perpendicular to those sides of @xmath33 ( as for centers @xmath38 and @xmath3 )",
    ", the subtended angle will always satisfy the hypothesis of lemma [ adjacentholelemma ] .    finally , consider the only other case , where the unit disk center lies in @xmath46 .",
    "an extreme point for this case , with the disk center at @xmath47 , is also shown in figure 3 .",
    "the endpoints of the arc of hole - disk tangencies are now determined by tangencies with the rectangle sides @xmath55 and @xmath54 ( as for centers @xmath8 and @xmath39 ) . the arc angle is an increasing function of the disk center , both as it moves from @xmath47 to @xmath44 and from @xmath47 to @xmath1 . since the hypothesis of lemma [ adjacentholelemma ]",
    "was already satisfied at @xmath47 where the angle is at a minimum , it holds throughout @xmath46 .",
    "[ holesamplinglemma ] let @xmath56 be a hexagonal lattice in the plane with minimum distance , then a hole placed anywhere in the plane will contain at least one point of @xmath56 .",
    "the hexagonal lattice @xmath56 with minimal distance @xmath27 is generated by translations @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the covering radius of @xmath56 , defined as the maximum distance between any point of the plane and the nearest point of @xmath56 , has value @xmath59 .",
    "a hole center placed anywhere in the plane will always be within distance @xmath60 of a point of @xmath56 . by choosing @xmath61 , or @xmath62 ,",
    "we ensure that the hole will contain a point of @xmath56 .",
    "[ 55thm ] the intersection of the rectangle of lemma [ holeinrectanglelemma ] with the lattice of lemma [ holesamplinglemma ] , suitably translated and rotated , gives a 55-point configuration that can not be covered by non - overlapping unit disks .",
    "let @xmath63 be the finite point set obtained by intersecting the rectangle @xmath33 in lemma [ holeinrectanglelemma ] with the lattice @xmath56 of lemma [ holesamplinglemma ] , to which we may apply arbitrary translations and rotations . by construction",
    "we know that , in any packing of unit disks , @xmath33 will contain a hole and this hole , as any hole , will contain a point of @xmath56 that is uncovered by unit disks .",
    "the relative translation and rotation used in the construction of the set @xmath63 shown in figure 1 was chosen to minimize the number of points . to verify that the constraint @xmath62 on the minimum distance of @xmath56 can be satisfied we first construct @xmath63 with @xmath64 and check is @xmath65 while the vertical dimension of @xmath33 is @xmath66 . ]",
    "that no points of @xmath56 lie on the boundary of @xmath33 .",
    "since this is the case for the 55-point configuration shown , the lattice can be compressed in scale ( to satisfy @xmath62 ) without additional points entering @xmath33 .",
    "that our lower bound on @xmath1 is poor can be seen from the proof of theorem [ 10thm ] .",
    "the argument bounds @xmath1 by the minimum number of interstitium translates @xmath67 required to cover the fundamental domain of the hexagonal lattice @xmath6 .",
    "our proof uses only the area of @xmath67 and does not exploit the fact that interstitia are rather inefficient covering shapes .",
    "figure 4 shows the thinnest lattice covering , requiring the 25 translates @xmath68 .",
    "the thinnest covering we have found is a non - lattice set of 23 translations and it appears unlikely that this number can be reduced significantly .",
    "the best lower bound , based on the close packing handicap for the second player , is therefore likely to be 23 or slightly smaller , although proving this appears difficult .",
    "there is a significant gap between the likely lower bound and our upper bound of 55 .",
    "depending on how strong of a handicap the close packing restriction is , the true value of @xmath1 will be closer to one end of this range or the other .",
    "the 55-point configuration appears to be non - optimal because not all of the points have the property that , when removed , the remaining points can be covered .",
    "we have not attempted to prove non - optimality because it involves the examination of many cases .",
    "the hardness of the packing - constrained point covering problem , or pc@xmath0 , can be assessed by identifying the complexity class @xcite of a discrete variant . finding a large set of binary codewords with a given minimum hamming distance is a discrete variant of the standard packing problem .",
    "this is already quite hard , being an instance of the independent set problem which is known to be np - complete .",
    "for pc@xmath0 we propose an analogous variant .",
    "fix the length of binary codewords .",
    "let @xmath12 be the set of all codebooks of @xmath1 distinct codewords , and @xmath25 the set of all codebooks of codewords with hamming distance greater than @xmath69 .",
    "problem : what is the minimum @xmath1 such that there exists a @xmath15 with the property that not all of its codewords are within hamming distance @xmath27 of a codeword in some @xmath70 ?",
    "the decision version of this problem ( given a particular @xmath1 ) is equivalent to a generalization of boolean satisfiability with two sets of variables , where a satisfying assignment for one set ( there exists @xmath70 ) is required for any truth assignment to the other subset ( for any @xmath15 ) .",
    "problems of this type are not in np but belong to the superset pspace of even harder problems .",
    "this observation suggests that computational efforts at improving the bounds for pc@xmath0 may not get very far ."
