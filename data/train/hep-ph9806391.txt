    "the latest experiments at the cern sps  @xcite machine have revealed a sizable enhancement of low mass dileptons above the two - pion threshold , triggering a number of theoretical investigations  @xcite .",
    "a somewhat smaller enhancement was also noticed in the intermediate mass region around the phi both in the dielectron ( ceres ) and dimuon ( helios ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "this region requires a strangeness assessment of the emission rates .",
    "an example is the recent analysis by li and gale  @xcite .    in a recent series of investigations we have assessed the dilepton and emission rates emanating from a hadronic gas without strangeness using general principles  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the current low mass dilepton enhancement can only be accounted for by allowing for a sizable nucleon density  @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that our construction is not a model .",

    "our results will borrow on the extension of the chiral reduction formulas to qcd with three flavors  @xcite .",
    "to leading order in the meson densities , the emission rates in the hadronic gas involve forward scattering amplitudes of real ( photon ) and virtual ( dilepton ) photons , which behaviour is constrained by data mostly from electro - production and photon - fusion reactions . by including strangeness we aim at evaluating the emission rates in the intermediate mass region around the phi . throughout",

    "the baryonic effects are important in the low mass region , but not enough to account for the discrepancy seen in the pb - au collisions at cern within the density expansion  @xcite .",
    "the large and persistent hadronic tails make the thermal mesonic emission rates comparable to the ones from a thermal gas through the intermediate mass region .",
    "as we have indicated in the introduction , our analysis is not based on a model .",
    "our only assumption is that the emission rates follow from a baryon free and dilute hadronic gas .",
    "the rest follows from symmetry and data . as such all model calculations should be in agreement with our results under these assumptions , and it is gratifying to see that the recent analysis performed by gale and li  @xcite using reaction rates does .    the fact that the helios-3 data can be explained without recourse to additional assumptions , make part of our arguments reliable .",
    "the persistent disparity in the low mass region with ceres and the newly measured @xmath0 spectra may indicate the need for an enlargement of the original assumptions .",
    "the importance of the thermal quark gas emissivities in the 1/2 and 1 gev region maybe indicative of some simple nonperturbative effects in the partonic phase for the temperatures considered  @xcite .",
    "this issue will be addressed next @xcite .",
