    "in the past few years , the algebraic approach to estimation in control systems proposed by fliess and co - workers has generated a number of interesting results for different problems of estimation of dynamical systems such as state estimation , parametric identification , and fault diagnosis , to name but a few ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". loosely speaking , this new estimation approach is mainly based on the robust computation of the time - derivatives of a noisy signal by using a finite weighted combination of time - integrations of this signal .",
    "these results , obtained through the use of differential algebra and operational calculus @xcite , allow to obtain an estimate of the time - derivative of a particular order in an arbitrary small amount of time @xcite .",
    "questions arise on how to relate the above to more classical results of automatic control , and in particular to linear system theory .",
    "the present paper contributes to this discussion by showing that the algebraic time - derivative estimation method , as presented in @xcite and references therein , can be seen , in a sense , as a special case of previously known state - space results exhibiting a deadbeat property .",
    "after this introduction , we briefly recall in section [ section - algebraic ] the main results of the algebraic time - derivative estimation method .",
    "then , in section [ section - gramian ] , we recall a few results of linear observability theory and show how in particular the reconstructibility gramian can be related to the algebraic method .",
    "we end this paper with a few additional remarks on how to relate further extensions of the algebraic approach with different areas of control systems theory .",
    "the algebraic derivative estimation techniques have been presented in various styles and frameworks , mostly based on abstract algebra and operational calculus .",
    "because of its practical interest , we recall here only the main result for a moving - horizon version of the approach ( see mboup-2007 and @xcite ) . however , note that the results shown in the present paper would also be very easily applicable to earlier expanding - horizon versions that can be found in fliess-2005gretsi - signal or @xcite .",
    "consider a real - valued , @xmath0-th degree polynomial function of time @xmath1where the terms @xmath2 are unknown constant coefficients .",
    "the goal is to obtain estimates of the time - derivatives of @xmath3 , up to order @xmath0 .    in @xcite , fliess and",
    "co - workers proposed to do so by , roughly speaking , resorting to algebraic combinations of moving - horizon time - integrations of the available signal @xmath3 .",
    "let us briefly recall these results in the following theorem @xcite .",
    "[ theorem - algebraic]for all @xmath4 , the @xmath5-th order time - derivative estimate @xmath6 , @xmath7 , of the polynomial signal @xmath8 as defined in ( [ taylor ] ) satisfies the convolution @xmath9where the convolution kernel @xmath10 depends on the order @xmath5 of the time derivative to be estimated and on an arbitrary constant time window length @xmath11.@xmath12    for the interested reader , as well as for the sake of completeness , a way to derive the results of theorem [ theorem - algebraic ] is given in appendix a.    thus , considering for example the degree - one polynomial@xmath13applying theorem [ theorem - algebraic ] would simply give us the following first - order time - derivative estimate @xmath14the effect of the time - integration is obviously to dampen the impact of the measurement noise on the estimate .",
    "note that this feature can also be used to filter out noise from the signal @xmath3 itself , as the zero - order time - derivative estimator would be @xmath15 as obtained , once again , from theorem  [ theorem - algebraic ] .",
    "as will be seen , the above may be related in several ways to more traditional results of classical linear control theory . to do so , consider now the following linear time - varying system@xmath16where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that while the form of system ( [ sys - dyn])-([sys - out ] ) was chosen for the sake of simplicity and ease of presentation , the discussion of the present section is extendible to systems with multiple inputs and outputs .",
    "then let us briefly recall a few elements pertaining to the notion of state _ reconstructibility _ @xcite .",
    "as noted in willems and mitter @xcite , this property has been quite overlooked in the control literature , possibly because of its equivalence with observability for linear continuous - time systems .",
    "loosely speaking , we say that system ( [ sys - dyn])-([sys - out ] ) is _ reconstructible _ on @xmath19 $ ] if @xmath20 can be obtained from the measurements @xmath3 for @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "a standard way of determining @xmath20 can be obtained by first writing the following expression for the output@xmath22where @xmath23 is the transition matrix of ( [ sys - dyn ] ) .",
    "then , left - multiply and integrate ( [ output - eq ] ) to get@xmath24 since in eq .",
    "( [ int - eq ] ) @xmath20 is a constant term with respect to the integral , it can be isolated , and we finally get , for an estimate @xmath25 of @xmath20 , @xmath26where@xmath27is the _ reconstructibility gramian_.    in treatments of observability in textbooks , developments such as the above are mostly used , through the observability counterpart of ( [ gramian ] ) , to check whether a system is observable ( resp .",
    "reconstructible ) or not .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite for the observability case , expression ( [ gramian ] ) can also be used to actually compute @xmath28 as integration will smooth out high - frequency noise .",
    "the above results are well - known , even if not as much used for state estimation as linear asymptotic observers are .",
    "but the former has the interesting property of allowing to give an estimate of @xmath20 in a _",
    "finite _ time , whose value is decided by the invertibility of ( gramian ) .",
    "interestingly , these two features of the above gramian - based estimation  deadbeat property and time - integration , coincide with those of algebraic time - derivative estimation .",
    "let us push the comparison a little further in a simple way by first noticing that the degree - one polynomial ( [ pol ] ) can be put into state - space phase - variable form with matrices@xmath29state @xmath30 and initial conditions @xmath31 .",
    "then , compute an estimate of @xmath32 using ( [ est - gramian ] ) and ( [ gramian ] ) . to do so , use the fact that the matrices in ( pol - matrices ) are time - invariant and that @xmath33 to obtain@xmath34which implies that@xmath35letting @xmath36 ( with @xmath11 fixed ) and @xmath37 , we then obtain from ( gramian ) the following gramian@xmath38which in turn is used , in combination with ( [ est - gramian ] ) , to get @xmath39hence , similarly to the previous section , an estimate of the derivatives of a degree - one polynomial can be obtained with time - integrations of the measured signal , albeit this time using tools from classical control theory .",
    "note , interestingly , that in this particular example , there is more than a mere similarity . indeed , after a simple change of variable @xmath40 in ( [ pol - est ] )",
    ", we find exactly the same expressions as ( [ y - dot - est ] ) and ( [ y - est ] ) .",
    "the above second - order case can be generalized to obtain the @xmath5-th time - derivative of any polynomial simply by specializing @xmath41 and @xmath42 in ( [ sys - dyn])-([sys - out ] ) to get a state - space description of polynomial ( [ taylor ] ) , which yields , in phase - variable form the @xmath43 square matrix    @xmath44   \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0% \\end{pmatrix } \\label{deadbeat}\\ ] ]    and the @xmath43 row vector@xmath45associated to the state vector @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "after several steps in line with the previous second - order example , we obtain , similarly to section [ section - algebraic ] , an expression of the @xmath5-th time - derivative of a polynomial signal ( [ taylor ] ) based on the reconstructibility gramian .",
    "this is summarized in the following theorem .",
    "[ theorem - gramian ] for all @xmath4 , the @xmath5-th order time - derivative estimate @xmath6 , @xmath7 , of the polynomial signal @xmath8 as defined in ( [ taylor ] ) satisfies the convolution @xmath48where the convolution kernel @xmath49depends on the order @xmath5 of the time derivative to be estimated and on an arbitrary constant time window length @xmath11.@xmath12    in the main , the proof is based on obtaining a closed - form expression corresponding to equations ( [ est - gramian ] ) and ( [ gramian ] ) for the particular case with matrices ( [ deadbeat ] ) and ( [ deadbeat_c ] ) .",
    "since this system is lti , the corresponding transition matrix results from the matrix exponential of ( [ deadbeat ] ) , i.e. @xmath50 \\vdots   & \\vdots   & \\vdots   & \\vdots   & \\ddots   & \\vdots   \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots   & t \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots   & 1% \\end{pmatrix}\\]]which is then used to obtain the state - transition matrix @xmath51consequently , the entries of the @xmath52 reconstructibility gramian matrix ( [ gramian ] ) read @xmath53 _ { ij}\\!(t_{0},t_{1})\\!=\\!\\!\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}% \\!\\!\\frac{(\\tau \\!-\\!t_{1})^{i+j-2}}{(i\\!-\\!1)!(j\\!-\\!1)!}d\\tau \\!=\\!\\frac{% -(t_{0}\\!-\\!t_{1})^{i+j-1}}{(i\\!-\\!1)!(j\\!-\\!1)!(i\\!+\\!j\\!-\\!1)}\\,.\\quad   \\label{qij}\\]]in view of ( [ est - gramian ] ) , the inversion of this gramian is required .",
    "its entries are provided in closed - form by lemma [ lemma - inverse ] in appendix b , that is @xmath54 _ { ij}(t_{0},t_{1 } ) = \\frac{(i-1 ) !",
    "\\,(j-1)!\\,(i+j-1)}{(t_{1}-t_{0})^{i+j-1 } } { \\binom{n+i}{n+1-j}}{\\binom{n+j}{n+1-i}}{\\binom{i+j-2}{i-1}}^2 . \\label{qij_inv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , by using eq .",
    "( [ qij_inv ] ) regarding the particular form of the transition matrix ( [ transition - matrix2 ] ) , the @xmath55-th component of @xmath56 follows from eq .",
    "( [ est - gramian ] ) @xmath57 _ { i+1,j+1}(t_{0},t_{1})\\ , \\frac{(\\tau",

    "let @xmath61 ( with @xmath11 fixed ) , and @xmath37 .",
    "proceed then to the change of variable @xmath40 to obtain ( reconest ) and ( [ ups ] ) , which completes the proof of the theorem .    as might be expected from the above discussion and the second - order example , it is possible to show an equivalence between the algebraic estimator of section [ section - algebraic ] and the one of theorem [ theorem - gramian ] , and this for all @xmath0 .",
    "we make this statement precise in the following theorem .",
    "[ piups_nonu ] let @xmath62 and @xmath63 be defined as in ( [ pi ] ) and ( [ ups ] ) , respectively .",
    "then for @xmath11 , @xmath64 $ ] , and @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath12    theorem [ piups_nonu ] follows from riesz representation theorem @xcite , which states that for every continuous linear functional @xmath67 on a hilbert space @xmath68 , a unique @xmath69 exists such that @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the inner product on @xmath68 .    in order to prepare the ground for applying this theorem , first note that for parameter @xmath11 fixed , the expressions @xmath72 and @xmath63 , given by ( [ pi ] ) and ( [ ups ] ) , are polynomials in @xmath73 of degree @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath74 fixed , furthermore @xmath75 is a polynomial in @xmath73 of degree @xmath0 which in view of ( [ taylor ] ) consequently spans @xmath76 , i.e. the hilbert space of degree @xmath0 polynomials equipped with the real - valued inner product @xmath77 hence , for @xmath11 fixed , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , letting @xmath80 with fixed @xmath81 we have that @xmath82 .    in accordance with ( [ a_j_at_t ] ) and ( [ reconest ] ) ,",
    "let @xmath83and@xmath84for @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , theorems [ theorem - algebraic ] and [ theorem - gramian ] imply that for any @xmath82 @xmath85since @xmath78 and @xmath86 , for @xmath87 fixed , the uniqueness of @xmath88 in riesz theorem shows that @xmath89 for @xmath7 , under the assumptions of theorem [ piups_nonu ] .",
    "note that other proofs of the previous theorem are also possible . for example",
    ", a somewhat more component - wise proof , based on modern computer algebra proof techniques @xcite , is presented in @xcite by showing specifically how the terms in ( [ pi ] ) relate to those of ( [ ups ] ) .",
    "in addition to the main result of section [ section - algebraic ] , fliess et al . proposed  several extensions or modifications , several of which having also connections with different areas of control systems .",
    "let us briefly consider some of them in the few following remarks .",
    "for instance , note that an _ expanding - horizon _ version of the algebraic method was first introduced in @xcite , which would correspond to let @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the reconstructibility gramian perspective . in this case ,",
    "an equivalence similar to theorem [ piups_nonu ] can still be obtained .",
    "furthermore , note that , interestingly , letting @xmath92 , and differentiating respectively @xmath93 and the product @xmath94 with respect to time using a few standard manipulations , we obtain @xmath95 and @xmath96 which draw similarities with the information form of the continuous - time kalman filter @xcite for system ( [ sys - dyn])-([sys - out ] ) with additive noise @xmath97 of identity covariance , @xmath98 , on the measurement equation ( [ sys - out ] ) .",
    "this in turn shows that , thanks to a simple modification of theorem [ piups_nonu ] for expanding horizons , links with optimal estimation could be obtained even though the derivations and motivations for the algebraic method are clearly different ( see in particular @xcite ) .    as another example",
    ", one could also consider identification problems , and parallels to the work of fliess and sira - ramrez @xcite on identifying linear systems using the algebraic method . indeed , replacing ( [ sys - dyn])-([sys - out ] ) with @xmath99where @xmath100 is a constant parameter vector to be estimated , introduce , similar to section [ section - gramian ] , the gramian - based receding - horizon estimator @xmath101 with @xmath102which is reminiscent of the well - known condition for persistent excitation ( see for example @xcite ) .    in an other extension presented in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose to further reduce the impact of measurement noise on the estimates by using additional integrations .",
    "this is also possible with the gramian point - of - view as both sides of ( [ int - eq ] ) can easily be time - integrated several additional times with respect to @xmath103 , as opposed to only once to obtain @xmath20  in fact , even filter operations with respect to the variable @xmath103 can be applied on both sides of ( [ int - eq ] ) , so as to generate a variety of further estimators . once again",
    ", an equivalence between this result of the algebraic approach and a particularization of a reconstructibility perspective can be obtained .",
    "more generally , we can for example insert in ( [ int - eq ] ) another kernel @xmath104 as follows @xmath105 where @xmath106this to obtain the desired response with respect to measurement noise .",
    "finally , and although it is clearly beyond the scope of the present paper , note that because of the convolution form of algebraic estimation ( a_j_at_t ) , the latter can also be connected with finite - impulse response ( fir ) differentiators , on which numerous studies and results were published ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , with the minor difference that these differentiators are usually described in a discrete - time framework , although it is clear that a comparison similar to the present paper could also be carried out in discrete - time",
    ".    in particular , it might be of interest to compare the latest extension of the algebraic estimation approach , where time - delays are considered to improve the results , together with fir differentiator designs considering the same issue that have been proposed over the past few years ( see for example @xcite  and @xcite ) .",
    "the authors would like to express their gratitude to the associate editor , as well as to the anonymous reviewers , whose comments and suggestions were very helpful in improving the present paper .",
    "johann reger thanks peter caines and jessy grizzle for valuable discussions .",
    "the work of johann reger was supported by fellowships of the german academic exchange service ( daad ) , grant d/07/40582 , and partially , by max planck institute for dynamics of complex technical systems in magdeburg , germany .",
    "the following proof resorts to standard techniques from operational calculus . to this end , we rephrase eq . ( [ taylor ] ) in the laplace domain as @xmath107where the coefficients @xmath2 are identified with @xmath108 . in order to single out a particular term , @xmath109 , first multiply ( [ yn ] ) by @xmath110 , @xmath111which results in a polynomial form in @xmath112 on the right side of ( operation1 ) . to eliminate the terms @xmath113 , differentiate ( [ operation1 ] ) @xmath114 times with respect to @xmath112 ( see fliess-2003mex for a first presentation of the idea ) .",
    "this yields @xmath115 in the next step , we proceed to a similar treatment to eliminate the remaining constant terms @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "but before doing so , premultiply ( [ operation2 ] ) by @xmath120 , that is @xmath121which is done to prevent @xmath109 from cancelation due to a @xmath5-fold differentiation with respect to @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , the latter operation finally gives @xmath122    this equation could readily be transformed back into the time domain .",
    "however , the left side of ( [ isolated ] ) contains the monomial @xmath123 , i.e. an @xmath0-fold differentiation with respect to time in the time domain , meaning if a high - frequency noise is corrupting @xmath3 , the former would be amplified as a result .",
    "note that a similar idea can also be found in @xcite . in order to avoid the explicit use of these time derivatives , premultiply ( [ isolated ] ) with @xmath124 , thus implying that @xmath3 will be integrated at least one time",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath125where it can been seen that the term @xmath109 depends only on a finite number of operations on the signal @xmath126 , as shown in mboup-2007,zehetner-2007cca .    before performing the backward transform into the time - domain ,",
    "rearrange the left side terms of ( [ vorleibniz ] ) using leibniz formula for the differentiation of products twice .",
    "this results in @xmath127which , in view of the right hand side of ( [ vorleibniz ] ) , implies in turn @xmath128eq .",
