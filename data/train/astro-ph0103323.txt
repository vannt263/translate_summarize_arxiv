    "the neutrons travel through intergalactic space and decay , and the neutron - decay electrons form synchrotron and compton halos around galaxies with grb activity",
    ". the discovery of neutron - decay halos around galaxies with vigorous star - forming activity will provide strong evidence for a grb origin of the uhecrs [ 3 ] .",
    "as a consequence of beppo - sax results , we now know that grbs are extragalactic and originate from sources with a broad distribution of redshifts and mean redshift @xmath2 .",
    "beppo - sax has a much smaller field - of - view than batse , but triggers on nearly the same sample of long - duration ( @xmath3 s ) grbs . if uhecrs originate from grbs , then the product of the uhecr energy density @xmath4 and the characteristic source volume @xmath5 is equal to the product of the grb power @xmath6 , the loss time from the source volume , and the efficiency @xmath7 to convert grb energy into uhecrs . for protons with energies @xmath8 ev , the gzk radius is @xmath9 mpc [ 5 ] .",
    "thus the loss time @xmath10 mpc / c @xmath11 s. hence @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a factor that takes into account present day star - formation activity compared with that occurring at @xmath14 .",

    "the power of grbs into the volume @xmath5 is given by the typical grb energy @xmath19 multiplied by the grb rate .",
    "batse is sensitive to grbs with peak fluxes @xmath20 ergs @xmath21 s@xmath22 .",
    "the observed mean duration of the long duration grbs is @xmath23 s. thus @xmath24 ergs , where @xmath25 is the efficiency for transforming the grb explosion energy into @xmath26 rays in the beppo - sax and batse energy bands .",

    "particle acceleration in grb blast waves must satisfy the hillas [ 8 ] condition for uhecr production , which requires that the larmor radius be smaller than the characteristic size of the acceleration region . for grb blast waves ,",

    "hence the particle larmor radius @xmath39 @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the maximum particle lorentz factor measured in the explosion frame , @xmath42 is the blast wave lorentz factor , @xmath43 is the comoving blast wave width , @xmath44 from hydrodynamics , and @xmath45 cm is the location of the blast wave from the explosion center .",
    "the blast - wave magnetic field @xmath46 g is defined by a magnetic - field parameter @xmath47 , and the term @xmath48 is the particle density of the surrounding medium .",
    "thus @xmath49 a wide range of parameter values can satisfy the hillas condition for accelerating uhecrs by stochastic acceleration through gyroresonant interactions with mhd turbulence in the blast wave fluid [ 4,9 ] .",
    "the alfvn speed @xmath50 in the relativistic shocked fluid is also relativistic ( naively using the nonrelativistic expression gives @xmath51 , resulting in an acceleration rate that is much more rapid for second - order than for first - order processes [ 9,10 ] .",
    "accelerated protons and ions interacting with nonthermal synchrotron radiation in the blast wave will produce neutrons through the process @xmath52 .",
