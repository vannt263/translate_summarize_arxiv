    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductors almost 20 years ago , among other things , has rekindled interest in the magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) - temperature ( @xmath1 ) phase diagram of type ii superconductors@xcite , generating a vigorous scientific activity . as a result ,",
    "much has been clarified about the nature of equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of vortex states in the presence of thermal fluctuations , pinning disorder and electrical ( `` super''- ) current@xcite , leading to a rich phase diagram . in particular ,",
    "in contrast to a mean - field phase diagram , thermal fluctuations drive a first - order melting of a vortex lattice over a large portion of the phase diagram into a resistive ( although with large conductivity and diamagnetic response ) vortex liquid@xcite , that , from the symmetry point of view is qualitatively identical to the normal state .",
    "furthermore , as was first shown by larkin@xcite , arbitrarily weak pinning disorder , on sufficiently long larkin scale ( that diverges in the limit of vanishing disorder ) always disrupts translational order of the vortex lattice .",
    "it has been argued theoretically@xcite , with a limited experimental support@xcite , that in the resulting state , vortices are collectively pinned into a vortex glass characterized by an edwards - anderson@xcite like order parameter , exhibiting a vanishing linear mobility and therefore a vanishing linear resistivity .",
    "while the original proposal for the vortex glass state was made in a context of intrinsic , short - range correlated ( point ) disorder , it was soon appreciated that the beneficiary effects of pinning can be enhanced by introducing artificial pinning centers by , for example , electron and/or heavy ion irradiation , with the latter resulting in a forest of columnar pinning defects , that is a particularly effective pinning mechanism@xcite .",
    "the resulting _ anisotropic _ vortex glass was dubbed a bose - glass@xcite because of its mathematical connection with interacting two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum bosons pinned by a quenched ( time - independent ) random 2d potential@xcite .",
    "this connection allowed understanding many of the properties of the anisotropic vortex glass from the corresponding quantum bose - glass phase.@xcite    one key feature of the anisotropic vortex glass that distinguishes it from the corresponding ( putative ) isotropic one is the existence of the `` transverse '' meissner effect,@xcite namely a vanishing response to a field @xmath2 applied transversely to columnar defects and vortex lines .",
    "this expulsion of the transverse flux density , @xmath3 , that has received considerable experimental@xcite and simulations@xcite support , corresponds to an effectively divergent anisotropic vortex glass tilt modulus@xcite , that in the quantum correspondence maps onto a vanishing superfluid density in the bose - glass phase . the detailed theoretical description of the transverse meissner effect ( as well as other properties of the phase ) has been predominantly limited to noninteracting vortex lines@xcite .",
    "although these are supported by scaling theories@xcite ( borrowed from the variable - range hopping theory for electronic systems@xcite ) that do incorporate effects of both disorder and interactions ( clearly essential for the very existence of the bose - glass phase ) , with the exception of functional rg analysis@xcite , a detailed interacting description is limited to simulations.@xcite this is not surprising , as a description of strongly interacting random systems is a notoriously difficult ( with few exceptions ) unsolved problem , whose solution is at the heart of understanding many of the interesting condensed matter phenomena .",
    "one way to incorporate strong interactions is to approach the problem from the vortex solid ( rather than the vortex liquid starting point ) pinned by a random potential .",
    "potential difficulties with this approach are a proper incorporation of topological defects ( dislocations and disclinations ) that tend to proliferate in the presence of quenched disorder and external perturbations .",
    "recent analytical real - space renormalization group ( rg ) study@xcite that demonstrated stability of a 3d weakly disordered random - field xy model to a proliferation of topological defects ( vortices ) , provide a strong argument for the stability of an elastically disordered but topologically ordered vortex bragg - glass phase postulated and studied in detail by giamarchi and le doussal@xcite .",
    "these studies therefore give support to treatments of vortex solids@xcite that ignore the notoriously difficult - to - treat topological defects .",
    "furthermore , even if bragg - glass _ is _ unstable to dislocations , for weak disorder dislocations will be dilute , with physics on scales smaller than their spacing expected to be well - described by the vortex bragg - glass phenomenology.@xcite    a suppression of topological defects can furthermore be facilitated by a planar confinement of vortices , realized in layered high - t@xmath4 superconductors ( e.g. , biscco)@xcite or by artificially prepared multilayers@xcite , where for a magnetic field directed along the planes , vortices are well localized to 2d .",
    "the resulting planar ( 2d ) vortex array pinned by point disorder , where dislocations are excluded by construction is in fact the `` toy '' model studied by matthew fisher@xcite , that motivated his original proposal of a vortex glass phase in bulk superconductors .    motivated by these ingredients , in this paper we study a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional vortex array confined to a planar slab of thickness @xmath5 in a presence of a single planar columnar defect , illustrated in fig.[2dlattice ] .",
    "this system was introduced and first studied in great detail in ref .  .",
    "( 40,50)(0,0 ) ( -23,2 )    ( 30,40)(0,0 )    as should be clear from the above discussion , such a `` toy '' model@xcite may be relevant to the regime of far - separated ( by @xmath6 , compared to vortex spacing @xmath7 ) columnar defects , accessible for flux density far exceeding the columnar - defect matching field @xmath8,@xcite where @xmath9g-@xmath10 is a fundamental quantum of flux . as first investigated in ref .  , we study the response of such a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional vortex array to a planar tilting magnetic field @xmath11 , applied transversely to the columnar defect , as illustrated in fig.[2dlatticetilted ] .",
    "( 40,50)(0,0 ) ( -23,2 )    ( 30,40)(0,0 )    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we conclude the introduction with a summary of our main results and predictions , heuristically extended to a dilute concentration of columnar defects . in sec.[model ] we derive the appropriate ( 1 + 1)-dimensional continuum model for a single defect and discuss its ingredients . by integrating out `` bulk '' ( away from the defect ) degrees of freedom we reduce this model to a ( 0 + 1)-dimensional model confined to a defect , and characterized by a long - range elasticity along the defect . in sec.[hperp ] we study the effect of transverse magnetic field @xmath11 and demonstrate that tilting of the vortex lattice away from a columnar defect proceeds via a novel `` commensurate - incommensurate transition '' controlled by a proliferation of solitons . in sec.[finitet ]",
    "we study effects of thermal fluctuations and demonstrate that this system exhibits a 1d `` roughening''-like transition .",
    "we explore its consequences for the vortex positional correlations , and construct a @xmath11@xmath1 phase diagram .",
    "we conclude in sec.[finitedefects ] with an extension of these results to an experimentally relevant case of a dilute concentration of columnar defects ( allowing for genuine transitions ) and close in sec.[conclusion].with a summary of our study .",
    "the body of the paper is primarily devoted to the study a planar ( 1 + 1)-dimensional vortex array at a 1d vortex density @xmath12 , in the presence of thermal fluctuations and induced by an external planar magnetic field @xmath13 applied at an angle to a single columnar defect@xcite . as we will show below , even this `` toy '' problem is quite rich , providing insight into the bulk ( 2 + 1)-dimensional multi - defect problem .",
    "it has the added benefit that it can be analyzed in detail analytically .",
    "this is not surprising as such a planar classical vortex array is a cousin of a one - dimensional quantum problem , a luttinger liquid , that is known to be exactly solvable and to exhibit rich phenomenology.@xcite in fact our classical analysis of the vortex problem has strong formal connections to the work of kane and fisher@xcite who studied a luttinger liquid in a presence of a single localized impurity , a problem that admits exact analysis@xcite .",
    "this connection was first emphasized and fruitfully utilized by hoffstetter _",
    "et al._@xcite and polkovnikov , _ et al._@xcite , although we will not take advantage of it .",
    "as is well known@xcite , the luttinger formalism is equivalent to the classical theory of vortex lattice elasticity that we ( and ref .  ) employ here .",
    "our work has a strong overlap with that of ref .  , particularly on the finite temperature analysis for a vanishing transverse field in an infinite single - pin system , as well as a large transverse field , where tilt response is analytic . where this overlap exists our predictions are in complete agreement with those found in ref .",
    "however , our emphasis is on the low - temperature , strong coupling regime , where tilt response is highly nonlinear , and can only be understood in detail in terms of vortex lattice solitons , that proliferate at a novel commensurate - incommensurate crossover , that , we argue , turns into a genuine sharp phase transition for a dilute concentration of columnar defects .",
    "hence , as we describe in more detail below , in the presence of a dilute concentration of columnar defects the planar vortex array exhibits two phases in the transverse field @xmath11  temperature @xmath1 phase diagram : a low @xmath1 , @xmath11 `` commensurate '' pinned / aligned ( c ) phase and a high @xmath1 , @xmath11 `` incommensurate '' depinned / tilted ( i ) phase . as illustrated in fig.[phasediagram ] , a novel finite temperature commensurate - incommensurate phase transition separates the two phases .",
    "( 40,70)(0,0 ) ( -22,-2 )    ( 30,40)(0,0 )    for a vanishing transverse field , the phase transition is akin to a thermal roughening transition@xcite , that is closely related to a zero - temperature superfluid - insulator transition in a resistively - shunted josephson junction@xcite , the opaque - to - transparent impurity transition in a luttinger liquid@xcite , and spin - boson and dissipative impurity models@xcite .",
    "before we discuss our results , a disclaimer is in order here .",
    "because a _ single _ columnar defect can not possibly compete with bulk degrees of freedom , with its effects vanishing in thermodynamic limit , we expect a two - dimensional free energy that is _ analytic _ , and therefore no true phase transition can take place in a 2d thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , as in , for example , the kondo problem@xcite , where one considers the effect of an impurity on the bulk electron gas , bulk effects are predicted only once a finite density of defects is considered . here too the transitions that we discuss are for the elastic degrees of freedom localized on the columnar defect , that is a _ boundary _ critical phenomenon .",
    "although the 1d roughening transition is indeed a genuine one , the contribution of the associated ( nonanalytic ) free energy to the bulk two - dimensional system vanishes in the 2d thermodynamic limit .",
    "furthermore , the ci ( vortex line tilting ) `` transition '' takes place at a lower - critical transverse field @xmath14 , that , in the case of one pin is driven to zero in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "it only becomes a genuine sharp phase transition for a finite density @xmath16 of columnar defects , with the lower - critical transverse field @xmath17 set by the columnar - pin spacing @xmath6.@xcite since this latter case is the one most easily accessible experimentally , we heuristically extend our rigorous single pin results to a finite dilute concentration of independent columnar defects .",
    "this being a notoriously difficult unsolved problem , we expect this heuristic extension to break down on sufficiently long scales , where collective pinning effects become important .",
    "@xcite    our results can be divided into two categories : thermal effects at a vanishing transverse field , i.e. , for the magnetic field ( and therefore induced planar vortex array ) aligned with columnar defects , and a low - temperature response of the vortex array to a tilting ( transverse ) magnetic field .    for a magnetic field aligned with columnar defects",
    "we show that a vortex array undergoes a `` roughening''-like transition at @xmath18 between a low - temperature state in which each columnar defect effectively pins the vortex lattice around the pin for @xmath19 and a phase in which its pinning effects , even near a columnar defect , vanish at long scales . in above , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are vortex lattice tilt and compressional moduli , whose vortex density and dependence on other parameters ( e.g. , vortex interaction ) can be computed from microscopics@xcite .",
    "this roughening - like transition is related to a one - dimensional long - range interacting ( @xmath22 ) ising model@xcite , that is well - known from a number of other physical contexts , most prominently the kondo problem@xcite , and more recently , in a dissipative josephson junction@xcite and a luttinger liquid in the presence of an impurity@xcite . in relation to the latter work , we note that unlike the quantum case where there is no simple way to tune the luttinger parameter@xcite , here it can be simply tuned by temperature and vortex density.@xcite    as is usually the case for such ( e.g. , roughening@xcite , kosterlitz - thouless@xcite , and other topological ) transitions there is no local order parameter and phases are distinguished by long - scale behavior of correlation functions .",

    "the low - temperature @xmath19 , the pinned ( commensurate ) phase is distinguished from the rough ( incommensurate ) phase by a transverse meissner response to a magnetic field @xmath11 applied transversely to the columnar pin .",

    "of course , ( as for the thermally - driven depinning transition discussed above , here too ) , because a single pin can not compete with the bulk magnetic energy , away from the defect beyond this screening length @xmath42 the vortex lattice is always aligned along the applied magnetic field .",
    "related to this , for a single pin ( @xmath43 ) the critical transverse field @xmath33 , eq.[hc1results ] clearly vanishes in the thermodynamic @xmath44 limit .    for a transverse field stronger than @xmath33 a continuous vortex lattice",
