    "nowadays , there is an increasing data availability .",
    "smartphones and wearables sensors , social media , web browsing information and sales recordings are only few of the newly available information sources .",
    "discovering dependencies and patterns within such datasets could provide useful insights to businesses or social scientists studying human behavior .",
    "an important part of such studies involves the discovery of correlation or causation links among factors of interest .",
    "for example , several studies examine the impact of sentiment and opinions expressed through social media to traded assets prices @xcite .",
    "others study the impact of location , activity and communication patters on people mood @xcite , stress level @xcite or eating and sleeping disorders @xcite by processing smartphones sensor data . in such studies ,",
    "the variables of interest are usually not directly measured .",
    "instead , they are inferred from raw data . for example , in @xcite a sentiment index is inferred from twitter data by applying text processing and classification techniques .",
    "however , such procedures result in inaccurate estimation of the variables of interest .",
    "moreover , several studies have shown that social media data in some countries have undergone censorship @xcite . in such cases , sentiment or opinion tracking",
    "could be biased .",
    "also , in @xcite , location context ( e.g. home , work , entertainment place etc . ) is used to understand the causal link between location and stress level .",
    "however , the real location context is not known ; instead it is inferred from smartphone sensors and consequently it could be inaccurate .",
    "causal discovery when key variables are unobserved or inaccurately measured is a particularly challenging task .",
    "latent variable models have been used to handle such cases @xcite .",
    "such models include one or more unobserved or latent variables .",
    "scientists usually attempt to estimate the values of a latent variable from other observed variables by fitting the data in a structural equation model @xcite . however , the selection of a proper model is a complex task which may result in misspecification and overfitting .",
    "matching design @xcite is an alternative causal inference approach which does not require fitting data to a structural equation model .",
    "the main idea is that the average impact of a treatment variable ( or predictor ) to an outcome or effect variable can be approximated by comparing the outcome variable values of units with similar characteristics and different treatment values . in order to minimize any bias due to differences on units characteristics ( _ confounding bias _ ) , matching methods attempt to find optimal pairs of units .",
    "when the values of these characteristics are inaccurately measured or inferred from other variables , matching may fail to sufficiently eliminate any confounding bias which may result in misleading conclusions about the causal relationship of the examined variables .",
    "in this work , we propose _ probabilistic matching _ , a matching method that takes into account the uncertainty about the real values of a noisy variable and attempts to find optimal pairs of units in order to maximize the probability that the matched units have similar characteristics .",
    "our method is based on the assumption that a probability distribution describing the real values of each unobserved variable is known or can be approximated .",
    "although this assumption may restrict the applicability of the proposed method , it is realistic in many scenarios .",
    "for example , when an inference procedure is applied in order to learn the values of an unobserved variable @xmath0 from some observed attributes @xmath1 , a probability distribution @xmath2 can be approximated , as we discuss later in section [ sec : evaluation ] .",
    "we evaluate the proposed matching framework on two different simulation studies in comparison with a conventional matching method .",
    "we demonstrate that probabilistic matching reduces significantly the confounding bias and results in more accurate causal conclusions .",
    "we also evaluate our method on a real dataset .",
    "in particular , we use the social media dataset described in @xcite in order to test whether text messages containing urls tend to be reposted more often .",
    "this dataset includes a rich variety of features extracted from weibo microblogging service for 111 users along with a manually assigned binary label for each user indicating whether he / she has been characterized as _ spammer _ or not . in our scenario",
    ", we assume that the _ spammer _ label is an unobserved confounding variable and we apply a spammer detection method @xcite in order to infer a label for each user from other observed attributes .",
    "we map the classification outputs to probability distributions describing the probability of a user to be a _ spammer _ and we use these probability distributions to our matching framework .",
    "we demonstrate that the number of urls in text messages indeed influences the number of reposts .",
    "we repeat our causality study by applying a conventional matching method in two scenarios : 1 ) the ground truth binary _ spammer _ identifier is known and 2 ) only the noisy _ spammer _ identifier inferred from the data is known .",
    "the results of the first scenario serve as the ground - truth .",
    "we demonstrate that our results come in agreement with the conclusions of the first scenario , while the examined conventional matching method fails to detect the causal link .",
    "in this section we provide some background knowledge on causal inference based on the matching design framework . for more clarity , we summarize the notation used in the paper in table [ tab : notation ] . according to rubin s framework @xcite , the causal impact of a binary treatment on a unit @xmath3",
    "can be assessed by comparing the outcome @xmath4 , if the unit has received the treatment , with the outcome @xmath5 , if the unit has not received the treatment .",
    "the _ fundamental problem of causal inference _ is that it is not possible to observe both @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the same unit @xmath3 .",
    "if treatment is randomly assigned , the average treatment effect ( ate ) can be estimated as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are expectations w.r.t .",
    "uniform distribution over treated and untreated units , respectively .",
    "however , if the treatment assignment is conditional on certain characteristics of the units , the causal inference could be biased .",
    "the characteristics of units are called _ confounding variables_. matching methods attempt to eliminate this bias by comparing the outcome values of units with similar observed characteristics . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath9 is a set of treated units and @xmath10 is a set of control units ( i.e. units which have not received the treatment ) , matching methods match each treated unit @xmath11 with the _ `` most similar '' _ control unit @xmath12 . if @xmath13 is the set of matched pairs of units , the average treatment effect is estimated as @xmath14 , where the expectation is with respect to uniform probability distribution over @xmath13 .",
    "the ( dis)similarity between units is measured as a distance between their confounding variable values ( for some metric ) .",
    ".notation . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "causal inference when important variables are missing is mainly based on structural equation models ( sems ) with latent variables @xcite .",
    "sems include two components : the structural model part describing the causal relationships between the predictors and the outcome variables and the measurement model describing the relationships of the latent variables with other observed variables .",
    "model selection is based on theoretical assumptions about data structure . after the model is specified it",
    "should be assessed whether the data fit on it by using statistical tests or fit indexes .",
    "graphical causal models with latent variables have also been used @xcite .",
    "our approach examines the problem of unobserved variables on a different causality framework ( i.e. the matching framework ) , thus it should be considered complementary rather than competitive to the existing methods .",
    "sems are usually based on assumptions about the model - class of the data , while matching methods require fewer assumptions . moreover , assessing the model bias with matching - based methods is straightforward by using balance diagnostics tests while , goodness - of - fit tests used with structural equation models can not assess whether systematic differences between units have been eliminated @xcite .",
    "thus , causal inference based on matching could be preferable in some cases . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our method is the first that considers the problem of unobserved factors on matching methods .",
    "we propose _ probabilistic matching _ , a novel approach for causal inference when one or more key variables are unobserved or noisy .",
    "our method is based on the assumption that probability distributions describing the values of the unobserved variables are known or can be approximated .",
    "we define a distance metric , based on genetic matching distance , that measures the dissimilarity between units by examining the difference on the quantiles of the stochastic variables of the study .",
    "we evaluate our method both on simulated and real datasets .",
    "we demonstrate that when the treatment variable is noisy , traditional matching methods may result in matching pairs with the same or similar treatment values .",
    "this weakens the observed effect of the treatment on the outcome variable and consequently , may result in missing true causal links .",
    "similarly , when there is noise on the confounding variables , existing matching methods fail to sufficiently reduce the confounding bias , which often results in false causality conclusions . we show that our approach is able to find better matches and , consequently , achieves more accurate causal conclusions .",
