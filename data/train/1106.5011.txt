    "no regular solution with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( the @xmath20 ground state ) is found for @xmath21 , this was first noticed by gordon in his pioneer paper @xcite .",
    "this is the problem so - called `` @xmath22 catastrophe '' .",
    "the problem was solved @xcite by considering the fact that the nucleus is not point - like and has an extended charge distribution , and the potential @xmath23 is not divergent when @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath22 catastrophe disappears and the energy - levels @xmath25 of the bound states @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 smoothly continue to drop toward the negative energy continuum ( @xmath30 ) , as @xmath17 increases to values larger than @xmath31 .",
    "the critical values @xmath32 for @xmath33 were found @xcite : @xmath34 is a critical value at which the lowest energy - level of the bound state @xmath20 encounters the negative energy continuum , while other bound states @xmath35 encounter the negative energy continuum at @xmath36 , thus energy - level - crossings and productions of electron and positron pair takes place , provided these bound states are unoccupied .",

    "the energy - level of the bound state @xmath20 can be estimated as follow , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the average radius of the @xmath20 state s orbit , and the binding energy of this state @xmath39 .",
    "if this bound state is unoccupied , the bare nucleus gains a binding energy @xmath40 larger than @xmath41 , and becomes unstable against the production of an electron - positron pair .",
