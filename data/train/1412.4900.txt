    "in some three - body @xmath14 meson decay of @xmath15 , with @xmath16 a baryon pair and @xmath17 a recoiled meson or photon , the partial decay width as the function of @xmath18 is observed to have a peak near @xmath19 of the threshold area .",
    "this is the so - called threshold enhancement , which dominates the decay branching ratio of @xmath15 .",
    "the examples of these decays include @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "theoretically , the threshold effect has been realized as the result of the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) effect  @xcite .",
    "consequently , many experimental data on the baryonic b decays can be well explained  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not the case for @xmath24 .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath24 presented by the lhcb collaboration is given by  @xcite : @xmath25 where the first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic , respectively , while the third one originates from the control channel branching fraction measurement .",
    "note that @xmath26 has been also given by the lhcb  @xcite . with @xmath27 ,",
    "the @xmath28 production has the direct transition from @xmath29 , which associates with the threshold enhancement , such that theoretical prediction of @xmath30 in refs .",
    "@xcite can be consistent with the observation .",
    "on the contrary , @xmath24 via @xmath31 leads to the ozi suppression , while @xmath32 should be first annihilated to produce @xmath28 . with the ozi suppression of @xmath33 @xcite ,",
    "one expects that @xmath34 , resulting in @xmath35 , while @xmath36 is considered to be at the same level as @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to understand the large branching ratio of around @xmath38 for @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ data1 ] ) , a new theoretical study on this decay is clearly needed .",
    "to explain @xmath39 , one possible solution is to have a resonant state between the @xmath40 annihilation and @xmath28 production in @xmath24 , so that the process through its mass shell allows an on - shell enhancement for the decay branching ratio .",
    "indeed , it is common to observe resonant peaks in @xmath20 .",
    "for example , one finds the @xmath41 mesons , where the resonant @xmath42 and @xmath43 raise the @xmath44 spectrum of @xmath45 @xcite , as well as those identified as the charmed baryons and the glueball from @xmath46 and @xmath28 spectra in @xmath47  @xcite , respectively . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , since @xmath48 with the quantum numbers @xmath49 or @xmath50 has the channel of @xmath51 , particularly , with its mass and decay width within the allowed region of the @xmath44 spectrum in @xmath24 , it is reasonable that @xmath52 can be our candidate as the resonant state in @xmath24 .",
    "the experimental status of @xmath52 is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where its evidences come from the mark  iii collaboration  @xcite and the bes collaboration  @xcite , also being supported by @xmath53 collisions  @xcite",
    ". however , the direct confirmations from @xmath54 collisions  @xcite and @xmath55 processes  @xcite are inconclusive .",
    "hence , it leaves the room for the @xmath0 meson decays to provide the new scenario for the @xmath52 study .",
    "moreover , according to the qcd models  @xcite , such as the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculation  @xcite , @xmath52 has the mass close to that of the tensor glueball ( @xmath56 ) with @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , the theoretical prediction of  @xcite @xmath57 agrees with the lower bound of @xmath58  @xcite . with @xmath1",
    "being identified as @xmath56 , eq .",
    "( [ g2_thery ] ) can be related to the radiative @xmath59 decays by the babar collaboration  @xcite , given by  @xcite , @xmath60 such that we obtain @xmath61 where the limit is based on the @xmath62 error of the measured value on @xmath63 .",
    "we remark that the results in eq .",
    "( [ fjdecays ] ) are consistent with the ratios : @xmath64 in the pdg  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall explain @xmath24 with @xmath1 as the resonant state to @xmath28 .",
    "due to this resonant state , we will also study the other hadronic decays of @xmath0 , such as @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",

    "the counting gives @xmath93 , in which 2 of them are for the gluons connecting to the valence quarks , while the rest one for the gluon speeding up @xmath94 in @xmath0 to be part of @xmath95 .",
    "as @xmath96 approaches the threshold area , the increasing value of @xmath97 creates a peak in the @xmath98 spectrum of @xmath99 , which interprets the threshold enhancement . under the su(3 ) flavor symmetry , @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "are related by @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , in which the reduced constants @xmath105 , ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 can be fitted through the measured baryonic decays  @xcite .    for @xmath108 , because the matrix elements of the @xmath109 transition need the @xmath32 annihilation to produce @xmath28 , which encounters the ozi suppression , it is not suitable for pqcd counting rules .",
    "consequently , @xmath39 is estimated to be smaller than @xmath5 as mentioned early .",

    "the matrix element of the resonant @xmath113 transition is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) stands for the decay width ( mass ) of @xmath52 . in terms of eqs .",

    "moreover , the dominant contribution to the branching ratio comes from the pole effect , which is even narrow , fixing the pole at @xmath125 gev .",
    "in fact , @xmath119 as the strong interaction conserves the parity , such that it is in the form of either @xmath126 or @xmath127 for the parity to be even or odd . hence , while @xmath52 has been confirmed to have an even parity as the data indicated  @xcite , @xmath128 . in eq .",

    ", we obtain the total branching ratio . here",
    "we will integrate over @xmath137 alone to have the partial branching ratio as the function of @xmath98 , such that the threshold and resonant effects drawn as the peaks in the @xmath98 spectra would be in comparison with the future experiments .",

    "the reason for this is that @xmath163 around the threshold area is smaller than @xmath164 by 100 mev , which causes the more constrained threshold effect .",

    "it is interesting to note that the assumption of the constant parameter of @xmath123 is demonstrated to be insensitive to the data fitting , while the pole effects via the resonant @xmath51 in @xmath167 are narrow and sharp , as shown in fig .",
