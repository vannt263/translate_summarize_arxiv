    ", we develop a theoretical description based on phase oscillators and four key ingredients motivated by the biology : ( i ) a frequency profile along the psm , slowing down the oscillations , ( ii ) coupling of oscillators , ( iii ) a time delay in the information transfer between neighboring oscillators , and ( iv ) the existence of a moving front that arrests the oscillations at the anterior end of the psm , while the posterior end moves due to embryonic outgrowth .",
    "this delayed coupling theory provides an excellent fit to the existing biological data , allows perturbations to the system to be analyzed in terms of underlying processes , and predicts how intercellular communication affects the collective period of the segmentation clock .",
    "below , we introduce the elements of the delayed coupling theory .      to provide a simple picture of the segmentation process , cooke and zeeman proposed a clock and wavefront model more than thirty years ago @xcite .",
    "however , to understand the role of collective processes in the emergence of dynamic gene expression patterns in the psm a more detailed analysis is needed , for which methods from other pattern forming systems can be borrowed @xcite . in particular , the periodic expression of genes in the oscillating psm cells can be described at tissue level using a set of phase oscillators , disregarding at this stage the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms that generate the oscillations and their pattern . in this phase description , each cell , or group of synchronous cells , is represented by an oscillator , and the state of each oscillator is characterized only by its phase in the cycle of periodic gene expression .",
    "oscillators with the same phase represent cells with equivalent expression level of cyclic genes .",
    "previous models described the psm as a continuous oscillatory medium with a phase defined at each point of the psm , see supplementary data of @xcite and @xcite . in this work",
    "we show that a phase description is sufficient to compute the overall spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and the collective period of the oscillations .",
    "it has been suggested that the arrest of the oscillations and the observed oscillating gene expression patterns are shaped by a spatial dependence of the frequency of the individual oscillators @xcite .",
    "a frequency profile could be controlled by the molecular gradients observed in the psm , see fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaries]c , _ e.g. _ the gradients of the growth factor fgf @xcite or of wnt signaling @xcite .",
    "several models have recently proposed regulatory mechanisms by which the genetic oscillations are affected by the gradients of signaling molecules along the psm @xcite . motivated by the changing width of the stripes of gene expression in the psm and the necessity that the oscillations slow down and finally stop at the arrest front , we include such a frequency profile in our theory . as with the assumption of cellular oscillators , our theory does not rely on the molecular origin of this frequency profile , and",
    "hence its inclusion is purely phenomenological .",
    "recent theoretical works seeking to describe spatiotemporal patterns in somitogenesis using phase oscillators have not included coupling between oscillators @xcite , although intercellular coupling has been considered in reduced models of regulatory circuits @xcite . here",
    ", coupling means that oscillators can influence the phase of their neighbors .",
    "coupling is essential to stabilize tissue - scale patterns against the unavoidable noise present in biological systems @xcite , and also to explain the re - synchronization of surgically inverted pieces of the psm @xcite .",
    "thus , in this work we propose a description based on coupled phase oscillators .",
    "coupling between cells via signaling macromolecules , _",
    "e.g. _ through the notch pathway @xcite , involves synthesis and trafficking of such molecules within cells .",
    "these dynamics imply the existence of time delays , which have been recently estimated to be in the range of tens of minutes in cell culture @xcite .",
    "time delays in the coupling can have an impact on the self - organization of coupled oscillators @xcite , making their inclusion in our theory important . for simplicity we will use here a deterministic time delay",
    "; a more realistic description would include a distribution of delays @xcite .",
    "the embryo is a rapidly growing system , elongating about one somite length per oscillation cycle , which takes around 25 minutes in zebrafish , 90 minutes in chick and 120 minutes in mouse .",
    "cells are continuously in transit from the tailbud through the psm , exiting it anteriorly as somites form .",
    "additionally , cell proliferation plays a role during elongation , but since in the psm it has a stochastic character it can be considered as a potential noise source @xcite not otherwise significantly affecting the oscillatory dynamics @xcite , and we do not consider it further here . to correctly understand the formation of patterns of gene expression and how the frequency is regulated ,",
    "it is necessary to consider the geometry and boundaries of the arena in which the process occurs . here",

    "we have chosen the frequency to be strictly zero at the arrest front .",
    "note however that this is not biologically necessary : a very low value of the frequency at the arrest front means a very large period of oscillation .",

    "the difference between what is termed a zebrafish mode of oscillation in somitogenesis and a mouse / chick mode , observed also in medaka @xcite , can be characterized as follows : in the zebrafish mode , several waves of gene expression sweep simultaneously through the psm , _ i.e. _ multiple stripes of expression are detected in _ in situ _ experiments ; in mouse / chick mode , only one wave is observed .",

    "a similar formalism for calculating the number of stripes has recently been published as supplementary material in @xcite .",
    "the underlying theory was previously proposed in @xcite , and is the same as our continuum theory , but without coupling , and hence without the effects caused by the delay in the coupling . however , in @xcite no explicit choice for the shape of the frequency profile is made , hence the resulting formula for the number of stripes is a function of an unknown integral , rather than a closed formula . our eq .",

    "this implies that the number of stripes can change by changing the shape of the frequency profile while leaving the collective period and segment length unaffected .",
    "previous hypotheses for the different modes include changes in period , loss of stripe specific cyclic gene enhancers , changes to the stability of cyclic mrna or different elongation velocities @xcite .",
    "the delayed coupling theory indicates that changes to the frequency profile , potentially through changes to fgf or wnt signaling gradients in the psm , and different sizes of the psm must be considered as well .",
    "this is consistent with recent experiments reported in @xcite , where extra stripes of gene expression appear in a mutant with an expanded psm .",
    "current regulatory network models for the genetic oscillations in somitogenesis @xcite , undergo a hopf bifurcation a generic mechanism by which oscillations can appear in a dynamical system when varying some parameters of the models , as for instance the transcriptional delays @xcite . although it is also valid in more general settings , our eq .",

    "the mechanism arresting the oscillations at the arrest front is a different problem not addressed in our present work . while the above mentioned models undergo a hopf bifurcation when varying one of their parameters , something completely different ( another kind of bifurcation triggered by the variation of a different parameter of the models , for instance ) may be happening at the arrest front .",
    "the possibility that the oscillations are coupled to a bistable switch related to the signaling gradients in the psm has been proposed @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the arrest of the oscillators would not be a result of the intrinsic mechanism of the oscillations , but would result from an external signal",
    ".      only stable solutions of our theory can be biologically relevant .",
    "in addition , we hypothesize that unique solutions are required to guarantee a robust behavior in the developing embryo . in the presence of multiple stable solutions for the collective frequency",
    ", fluctuations could drive the system to switch between these different states , with dramatic consequences for healthy development . for this reason",
    ", we conjecture that if several time delays are consistent with a fit to experimental data , those yielding a unique value of the collective frequency should be favored .",
    "biochemical evidence indicates that coupling time delays should be relatively short compared to other signaling processes in the vertebrate segmentation clock @xcite , thus likely precluding the observation of multistability in such an embryonic system .",
    "multistability has been observed in other systems where coupling delays can be large , with applications in biochemistry @xcite , chemistry @xcite , control theory @xcite or laser physics @xcite , for example .",
    "key quantitative experiments in vertebrate segmentation include determination of segmentation rates @xcite , and the analysis of expression patterns from _ in situ _",
    "experiments @xcite and fluorescent reporter genes @xcite .",
    "our theoretical description allows for quantitative analysis of these experiments .    the comparison to experimentally observed dynamic patterns of gene expression",
    "permits the determination of the model parameters , which are provided for wildtype zebrafish in table  i. future studies in mutant embryos or embryos treated with different inhibitors will reveal which parameters are affected .",
    "the parameters in our model can be related to different cellular functions such as molecular synthesis and trafficking of signals in the cell ( coupling delay @xmath91 ) ; the strength of intercellular signaling ( coupling strength @xmath90 ) ; the speed of a cell autonomous oscillator ( intrinsic frequency @xmath28 ) ; changes in the signaling gradients responsible for the frequency profile ( decay length @xmath1 ) ; and changes in the position of the arrest front ( reflected by the system length @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , analysis of experimental results using our theory can provide a deeper understanding of how molecular changes lead to new phenotypes from the altered collective dynamics of tissues .",
    "our framework can be extended to other developmental processes that combine growth with a molecular clock .",
    "these are for instance fore - limb autopod outgrowth and patterning @xcite , or segmentation in short germ band insects , spiders , centipedes , and other invertebrates that might form segments by a mechanism similar to the one we described @xcite .",
    "the delayed coupling theory describes spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression during morphogenesis in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "most importantly , our phenomenological theory provides a unified quantitative framework relating the segmentation period and cyclic patterns of gene expression to underlying properties , such as the characteristics of intercellular communication , cell autonomous oscillations , the spatial profile of the slowing of the oscillators in the psm , the rate of axial growth and the size of the psm .",
    "our results indicate that the specific spatial pattern of cyclic gene expression in the psm does not affect the overall timing of somitogenesis , but intercellular communication should be considered as a fundamental mechanism in setting the collective frequency of the segmentation clock .",
    "starting from eq .  ( [ eq : discrete - psm ] ) a continuum limit describing the evolution of the phase can systematically be derived for any value of the time delay .",
    "this continuum limit is valid when the typical length scale of the modulations of the pattern is much larger than the distance between oscillators , @xmath7 .",
    "the limit is obtained by letting the distance @xmath7 tend to zero , while the total number of oscillators @xmath3 tends to infinite , in such a way that the length of the psm , @xmath127 , remains finite and constant . in the continum limit ,",
