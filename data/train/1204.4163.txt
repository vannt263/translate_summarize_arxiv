    "both positrons ( @xmath0 ) and positronium atoms @xmath1 have important applications in many different branches of physics , chemistry and other fields  @xcite .",
    "this has motivated numerous studies of collisions in which electrons in atomic or molecular targets are captured by positrons  @xcite . in a collision , each of the various modes into which the system under study may be fragmented is called a channel . for definiteness , consider the positron - helium scattering system , on which the present paper is focused . in the entrance channel of the @xmath2 system the positron impacts on the helium atom .",
    "the exit channel can be one of a number of possible fragmentations , such as elastic or excitation scattering ( @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 ) , positronium formation ( @xmath5 ) , or ionization ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "an exit channel is said to be open if the corresponding collision is allowed by all known conservation laws , such as energy and momentum conservation ; otherwise , it is said to be closed .",
    "since the transition amplitude in general is a function of the energy , the occurrence probability for each open channel depends on the impact energy of the projectile .",
    "the transition probabilities per unit time , per unit target scatterer and per unit of the flux of incident particles with respect to the target are called the cross section .",
    "experiments measure cross sections , while theoretical studies usually attempt to compute them . in positron - helium collisions , since the charge transfer process amounts to a four - body problem , the theoretical investigation of the rearrangement involves the full complexities of the quantum mechanical four - body problem and as such is too difficult to be exactly solved .",
    "notwithstanding the difficulty , numerous theoretical investigations are found in the literature  @xcite , along with experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "most of the theories were formulated within a single active electron picture . in this formalism , it is important to provide a consistent and realistic treatment of the passive electron screening effects , in order to satisfy the coulomb boundary conditions and post - prior equivalency and to make the wave functions , binding energies , and coulomb phase factors consistent with each other .    in the context of k - shell",
    "electron capture processes by fast protons from multi electron atoms , decker and eichler have discussed the deviations of a few of the standard formalisms from these constraints in some detail  @xcite . they adopted a parameterized potential due to green , sellin and zocher  @xcite , the gsz potential , to construct a self - consistent screened boundary - corrected first - born - approximation theory for calculation of the k - shell electron capture total cross sections in collisions of proton with helium and carbon as well as collision of alpha particles with lithium atoms .    in the present paper a distorted - wave boundary - corrected first - order born ( dwb1b ) formalism accompanied by the gsz potential is applied to obtain a satisfactory description of positronium formation in positron - helium atom collisions at intermediate energies . in this model ,",
    "the single - zeta hartree - fock wave function and its corresponding binding energy , which show very good agreement with those for gsz potential , describe the initial bound state of the electron .",
    "consequently the wave function and the corresponding energy in the post or prior formalisms are the eigenfunction and eigenenergy of the same effective screening potential that appears explicitly in the corresponding amplitudes .",
    "thus , in addition to satisfying both the coulomb boundary conditions an post - prior symmetry , the wave functions , binding energies and coulomb phase factors are consistent with each other .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  2 outlines the formalism .",
    "section 3 presents and discusses the results and compares them with other theories and experimental data .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) and  ( [ eq4 ] ) , the plane wave functions describe the heavy - particle motion in the entrance and exit channels , and the phase factors ensure that the overall solutions satisfy the proper asymptotic boundary conditions for the distorting potentials . in these equations ,",

    "near the nucleus the projectile ion feels the bare nuclear charge @xmath42 , while at large distances the potential behaves as @xmath48 corresponding to the residual singly charged ion .",
    "with the potential  ( [ eq5 ] ) , the post and prior amplitudes  ( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq2 ] ) satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions in the initial and final channels .",
    "it is easy to see that the two amplitudes are identical provided that @xmath49 and @xmath25 be the exact solutions of the atomic schrdinger equations associated with the potentials @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the angular differential cross sections for positronium formation at three incident energies , 100 , 200 and 500  ev . all three curves display a dip due to the cancelation between the contributions of the attractive and repulsive interactions to the first - order transition amplitude . a similar",
    ", unphysical dip has been found in a first - order born treatment of electron capture in the collision of a proton with hydrogen atoms  @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig1](a ) and ( b ) compare our results with those of the coulomb - born approximation ( cba )  @xcite for three impact energies : 100 , 200 and 500ev . in our computation , the dark angles , i.  e. , the angles at which cancelation occurs , are @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , while the cba displays dark angles of @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . in both treatments , the dark angle becomes smaller as the incident energy grows .",
    "our results differ significantly from the cba data at 100  ev incident energy . below ( above ) @xmath102 scattering angle our differential cross sections are always smaller ( larger ) than the cba results . as the impact energy increases , the difference between the our results and the cba results shrinks . compared with the difference at 100  ev ,",
    "the difference at 200  ev is smaller , and the difference at 500  ev is negligible . for energies above 500  ev , our results are consistent with the cba results",
    ". consequently , the total cross sections obtained from the two formalisms converge at high energies .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] compares the total positronium - formation cross sections obtained from our formalism with the experimental measurements of diana  et  al  @xcite , fromme  et  al  @xcite , fornari  et  al  @xcite , overton  et  al  @xcite and murtagh  et  al  @xcite and also with the results of the @xmath103 with @xmath104 , 2 and @xmath105  @xcite and of the two - center convergent close - coupling ( ccc ) formalism  @xcite . as fig .",
    "2(a ) shows , in spite of its simplicity our formalism yields reasonable agreement with experiment at energies above 50  ev .",
    "both the present approach and the cba formalism  @xcite are based on perturbation expansion , an approach long known to be unreliable at low scattering energies .",
    "for the first - order born approximation to be accurate , the higher - order terms in the expansion series must be small in comparison with the first - order term . at high energies , since two - step scattering processes , such as the thomas double - scattering mechanism , become dominant at high energies , the first - order approach yields poor approximations to the differential cross sections .",
    "all considered , we see that first - order methods are only reliable in a bracket of energies not so low as to render the perturbative method inapplicable and not so high as to make double - scattering mechanisms dominant",
    ".    both the cba and our approach satisfy the correct boundary conditions .",
    "the two methods are nonetheless nonequivalent : while the cba breaks post - prior symmetry , our approach is symmetric , so that the initial and final wavefunctions associated with gsz potential are consistent with the scattering potential and bound energies .",
    "our approach is hence expected to be more appropriate to describe experimental processes . as the plots in fig .",
    "2(b ) show , however , only small differences separate the cba results from ours .",
    "more accurate positronium - formation cross sections are obtained with the ccc formalism , a more elaborate method employing a multiconfigurational wavefunction treatment to describe the he ground state .",
    "the accuracy of the calculated cross sections is controlled by the size of the basis and of the set quantum numbers of the included states at each center .",

    "[ fig2](b ) agrees with the ccc line .",
    "the difference between the two sets theoretical data is less than @xmath106 around 50  @xmath107 , while deviations of approximately 17% separate the cba and ccc curves in the same region . at higher energies",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] compares various theoretical approaches with experiment .",
    "cross sections calculated by the cba with @xmath108 and @xmath105  @xcite , the correct - boundary first - order born  ( b1b )  @xcite formalism , the distorted - wave born  ( dw ) approximation  @xcite , the continuum distorted wave  ( cdw ) approximation  @xcite and the close - coupling method  ( cc )  @xcite are compared with the experiments of fornari  et  al  @xcite and overton  et  al  @xcite .",
    "the cba , cdw , and cc agree well with the measurments in the depicted energy range .",
    "the agreement between b1b and dw at high energies is fair , but at lower energies those theories deviate from the measurements .",
    "our predictions also deviate from experiment at low energies , but the agreement improves as the energy increases . compared with the results of b1b and dw , our results are closer to the experimental data at low energies .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] compares the above discussed theories with the earlier experimental measurements reported by murtagh  et  al  @xcite .",
    "the cdw , cc , and cba formalisms yield results in very good agreement with experiment over the entire energy range .",
    "our results are also in good agreement at energies above 75  ev , but the discrepancies are sizable at lower energies .",
    "the b1b and dw results are above the data by murtagh  et  al  @xcite for all energies lower than 200  ev , the deviation growing considerably as the impact energy decreases . above 200  ev , all theories converge to the experimental data .",
    "in addition to the ccc formalism , a number of theoretical descriptions of positronium formation in positron - helium atom collisions have been recently reportde , on the basis of the momentum - space coupled - channel optical ( cco ) method @xcite and second - order distorted - wave approximation ( dwa ) @xcite .",
    "figure 5 compares our results in the energy range of 50 - 250  ev with the available results from the cco and dwa formalisms , as well as with the experimental data reported by different groups  @xcite .",
    "our first - order distorted wave results are very close to the predictions of the second - order dwa , in which the cross sections for ps formation in the 1s orbital has been added to 1.66 times the ps cross sections in the @xmath109 orbitals to yield the total ps formation cross sections .",
    "below 80 ev our results understimate the experimental cross sections . at small energies all theories in the plot become inaccurate , the the cco cross sections overshooting the data by murtagh et al  @xcite . at",
    "relatively higher energies , above 80  ev our results agree with the other theoretical predictions and with the measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the total positronium - formation cross sections in our calculation formalism and all the above - mentioned theoretical calculations .",
    "comparison with measurements reported by murtagh  et  al  @xcite identifies the cdw  @xcite , cc  @xcite and cba ( with @xmath110 ) as the most reliable ones . as before ,",
    "our data show only fair agreement with these three theories , at low energies , and good agreement at higher energies . compared with the results of fojn  et  al  @xcite and of bransden  et  al  @xcite ,",
    "our results show substantially superior agreement with experiment low energies . in the considered range of impact energies ,",
    "our results are compatible with those from the more complex ccc formalism .",
    "in summary , we have applied a first - order distorted wave with correct boundary conditions to positronium formation from helium atoms . a parameterized potential in good agreement with roothaan - hartree - fock wavefunction and the corresponding binding energy described the screening effect of the passive electron on the transition amplitude .",
    "our theory is self - consistent , since it satisfies the correct boundary conditions and the post - prior symmetry , and since the interaction potentials , wavefunctions , binding energies and coulomb phase factors in the formalism are consistent with each other and describe the collision and electron capture realistically .",
    "the chief advantage of our approach is its simplicity .",
    "the figures in this paper comprehensively compare the results of this approach with different sets of experimental data and with the results of more elaborate theories .",
    "they hence set benchmarks monitoring the accuracy of the treatment . compared with the results of the cba , the angular distribution of our differential cross sections are in qualitative agreement even at the smallest energies",
    ": they differ quantitatively at the smallest energies , but the agreement improves as the impact energy grows .",
    "our calculated total cross sections are in reasonable agreement with other theories , such as the cba , cdw , cc , cco , and dwa , especially at higher energies .",
    "also the results agree well with with the experimental data of fornari  et  al  @xcite , overton  et  al  @xcite , and murtagh  et  al  @xcite , the agreement with the latter authors being very good at incident energies above 75  ev .",
    "as evidenced by comparison with experimental and other theoretical data , our procedure becomes less accurate as the impact energy is reduced , significant deviations becoming apparent around 50  ev .",
    "our relatively simple approach , based on the first - order distorted - wave formalism reproduces the results of more demanding procedures , based on the second - order distorted wave approximation .",
    "it can be applied to positronium formation in multi - electron atoms , such a c , ne , na , and ar , and also to electron caputre from atomic shells of multi - electron atoms by bare ion projectiles at moderate energies .",
