    "ls  i+61@xmath3303 ( v615 cas , gt  0236 + 610 ) is a radio emitting be / x - ray binary , with its primary being a rapidly rotating b0v star with an equatorial disk .",
    "the secondary is a compact object , most probably a neutron star , orbiting in an eccentric orbit .",
    "the most spectacular phenomena associated with this object are its periodic non - thermal radio outbursts , repeating every @xmath4 d. this interval is supposed to be the orbital period of the binary .",
    "the h@xmath2 of ls  i+61@xmath1303  is observed as a double peaked emission line of variable profile intensity which is not peculiar with respect to those observed in other be stars high resolution h@xmath2 observations of this object are discussed in few papers ( paredes et al .",
    "1994 , zamanov et al .",
    "1999 ) . in these papers ,",
    "variability of the h@xmath2 emission line was established over time scales of days and two possible interpretations were proposed to account for it , namely : ( i ) an influence of the compact object onto the be star disk ; ( ii ) an unresolved emission line component due to gas within the system or ejected from it .",
    "the present paper discusses @xmath0 observations of ls  i+61@xmath1303with the aim of testing the reality of proposed unresolved component .",
    "the observations were obtained with the coud spectrograph of the 2 m telescope at the bulgarian nao `` rozhen '' .",
    "they cover about 110   ( 0.2   pixel@xmath5 ) and have a signal - to - noise ratio in the range 30 - 50 . in order to detect a possible narrow or unresolved component",
    "we have applied the following procedure :    1 .",
    "all spectra were transformed to an uniform heliocentric wavelength set .",
    "the spectra were divided into 10 groups .",
    "every group consists of 3 - 4 spectra , obtained in consecutive or close nights . for each group the  minimum spectrum \"",
    "was generated by taking the minimum pixel intensity from all the spectra of the group over the uniform wavelength set .",
    "the  minimum spectrum \" was subtracted from all spectra in the group .",
    "the residuals were smoothed with a moving average over 10 - 15 points ( 2 to 3  ) .",
    "an example is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the applied procedure assumes explicitly that , if moving component exists , it must appear as a pure emission line ( not absorption ) .",
    "= 6.0 cm    it is visible in fig .",
    "1 that a moving narrow component does exists .",
    "this feature clearly shows up in most residual plots after the  minimum spectrum \" is subtracted .",
    "the typical fwhm of this moving component is 4 - 8  , with a normalized intensity about 0.1 - 0.2 .",
    "the radial velocity of the component was determined by employing a gaussian fit , with a typical error of @xmath6 km s@xmath5 .",
    "we plotted our measurements in the left panel of fig .",
    "2 folded on the radio phase of ls  i+61@xmath1303 .",
    "the latest ephemeris by gregory et al .",
    "( 1999 ) was used for this purpose , with the phase origin set at jd 2443366.775 and a 26.4917 d radio period being adopted .",
    "a clear trend of the component radial velocity emerges in this figure .",
    "indeed , a modulation with the same 26.5 d radio period and a @xmath7 km s@xmath5 amplitude seems to be present in the data .",
    "such a strong radial velocity dependence gives us confidence that we are detecting a real variability , and that this is not likely to be an artifact of the applied procedure .",
    "it deserves to be noted here that the moving component was already directly visible in the high resolution spectra of paredes et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , and without any subtraction procedure being applied .",
    "the radial velocity measurements of these authors have been incorporated in fig .",
    "2 and they are in excellent agreement with our observations .    by fitting to the data",
    "points a least squares cosine function of the form : @xmath8 } , \\;$ ] we obtain the following best fit parameters : @xmath9 km s@xmath5 , @xmath10 km s@xmath5 , and a phase shift @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the radio phase ) .",
    "as it can be expected , the parameter @xmath13 is near to the system velocity @xmath14 km s@xmath5 derived by hutchings & crampton ( 1981 ) .",
    "the best fit cosine fit is plotted in fig .",
    "2 as a solid line .    = 4.0 cm",
    "what is the origin of the moving component ? among possible interpretations , one could think of a possible relationship with the compact companion in the ls  i+61@xmath1303  system , i.e. , due to matter captured by the neutron star from the be star wind - the material around the neutron star , or an accretion disk , or an accretion wake .",
    "the orbital parameters of ls  i+61@xmath1303  are not well constrained so far .",
    "the proposed orbits by hutchings & crampton ( 1981 ) and mart & paredes ( 1995 ) are quite different . in spite of this uncertainty ,",
    "the observed variations up to @xmath15 km s@xmath5 are significantly larger than those expected from the orbital motion of the neutron star , as well as of the be star , in all proposed orbital solutions .",
    "consequently a direct relationship , in the sense that the moving component is reflecting the motion of the neutron star , does not seem to apply unless the orbit is extremely eccentric , and alternative interpretations need to be considered .",
    "the spectrally resolved interferometry of @xmath16 tauri by vakili et al .",
    "( 1998 ) has shown a bulge of emission in the disk of this be star .",
    "these authors have interpreted their interferometric and h@xmath2 observations assuming that such a bulge follows a circular orbit in the equatorial disk plane , at a distance of about 7 stellar radii from the central star . in this context , it is thus conceivable to us that the moving h@xmath2 component in ls  i+61@xmath1303is also due to a bulge region existing in the circumstellar disk .    under the assumption that this is the case ,",
    "let us find the position of the bulge .",
    "hereafter , we will adopt the following parameters for the be star in ls  i+61@xmath1303 : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 km s@xmath5 ( hutchings & crampton 1981 ) .",
    "assuming that the star rotates at 90% of its critical velocity ( sletteback et al .",
    "1992 ) , we derive @xmath20 and @xmath21 . consequently , from the term @xmath22 in eq .  1 and the above assumptions we obtain that the bulge in ls  i+61@xmath1303rotates at a velocity @xmath23 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of about @xmath24 @xmath25 , provided that the bulge is in a keplerian orbit around the star .    from the relationship between the separation of the h@xmath2 peaks , @xmath26 , and the outer radius @xmath27 of a keplerian emitting disk : @xmath28 we find that @xmath29 - 6.6 @xmath25 ( using @xmath30 - 360 km s@xmath5 , zamanov et al .",
    "this result compares satisfactorily to the bulge distance found above and implies that the bulge must be located near to the outer edge of the @xmath0 emitting disk .",
    "a schematic picture of the @xmath0 disk and the position of the bulge is represented in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 .    as mentioned before ,",
    "the orbital elements of the be x - ray binary ls  i+61@xmath1303  are not well determined . from the 26.5 d period present in the @xmath31 data",
    ", one could wonder if the position of the bulge should be in phase with the motion of the neutron star .",
    "however , this does not occur in any of the proposed orbital solutions . whether at the end there is a relationship between the bulge position and that of the neutron star remains to be determined by a careful revision of orbital solutions in the future .",
