    "this state arises in the system with weak disorder , when the magnitude of the repulsive or negative coupling is smaller than that of the positive coupling and the numbers of the two type of oscillators are not too different .",

    "only the data on the traveling speed are presented ; other quantities behave similarly to the corresponding data in fig .",
    "[ fig : wdp ] .    such behaviors can be explained as follows : suppose that there are @xmath51 positive oscillators having the phase @xmath27 and @xmath52 negative oscillators with the phase @xmath28 and assume that the remaining oscillators are desynchronized and have no net effect on @xmath30 . with this assumption , it is straightforward to derive , from eq .",

    "yields good fitting with data points .",
    "this equation manifests that the initial increase of @xmath30 is due to the increase of @xmath37 as well as to the decrease of @xmath26 .",
    "the final decrease is attributed to the rapid increase of the phase split to @xmath0 .",
    "equation  ( [ wformula ] ) indicates that the traveling speeds @xmath54 of positive and negative oscillators can be written in the form : @xmath55 it should be pointed out that in the near - stationary state , the traveling speed of positive oscillators , when clustered , is almost the same as the phase speed @xmath56 of the average phase of positive oscillators while that of negative oscillators is smaller than @xmath57 .",
    "the reason why the traveling speed of a negative cluster can be lower than its phase speed @xmath57 may be understood as follows : negative oscillators repel each other in a cluster and the negative cluster , if left alone , becomes unstable . due to this unstableness and attraction of positive oscillators ,",
    "some negative oscillators tend to move away from the peak of the cluster toward the positive cluster .",
    "this will make the traveling speed less than the phase speed of the negative cluster .",
    "now , using eqs .",
    "( [ wformula ] ) and ( [ wformula- ] ) , we can probe how the @xmath0-state forms from the two clusters of the delta distribution , namely , positive oscillators at one given phase and negative oscillators at another given phase .",
    "if these clusters are separated initially by a phase difference less than @xmath0 , the negative cluster will run away from the positive one , with the latter following the former . when the phase speed of negative oscillators is larger than that of positive ones , the phase split increases to @xmath0 radian .",
    "then all traveling speeds vanish together and a non - traveling stationary state is formed .",
    "the traveling state can be understood in a similar manner , again in consideration of the two clusters of the delta distribution .",
    "when the traveling speed of the positive cluster is sufficiently larger than that of the negative cluster , the phase split may never reach @xmath0 radian and will arrive in a quasi - stationary state where the phase speeds of the two clusters are almost the same ( and larger than the traveling speed of negative oscillators . ) here the positive cluster appears to chase the negative one , making it move faster than its traveling speed , which has been confirmed ( data not shown ) .",

    "when @xmath61 is larger than @xmath62 , there may not arise the traveling state since @xmath57 is larger than @xmath63 .",

    "effects of increasing @xmath37 dominate although increasing @xmath26 plays a role against this .",
    "the subsequent decrease is accompanied by both the decrease in order parameters and the increase in @xmath26 toward @xmath0 ; this can be understood with the help of eq .",

    "the transition to a non - traveling state takes place at smaller values of @xmath65 , as shown in fig .",
