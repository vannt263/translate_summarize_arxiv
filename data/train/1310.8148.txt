    "when studying the expressive power of monadic second - order logic ( @xmath0 ) for finite graphs , often the question arises of whether one can define a linear order on the vertex set .",
    "for instance , the property that a set has even cardinality can not , in general , be expressed in @xmath0 . if , however , the considered set is linearly ordered , we can write down a corresponding @xmath0-formula .",
    "the same holds for every predicate @xmath1 expressing that the cardinality of the set  @xmath2 is a multiple of  @xmath3 .",
    "it follows that the extension of @xmath0 by the predicates @xmath1 , called _ counting monadic second - order logic _ ( @xmath4 ) , is no more powerful than @xmath0 on every class of structures on which a linear order is @xmath0-definable .",
    "another example of a situation where the availability of a linear order facilitates certain logical constructions is the definability of graph decompositions such as the modular decomposition of a graph .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that the modular decomposition of a graph is definable in @xmath0 if the graph is equipped with a linear order . finally , if we can order the neighbours of each vertex ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for @xmath5-connected graphs",
    "such an ordering is always definable , but for graphs that are not @xmath5-connected this is not always the case . ] although we will not address complexity questions in this article , we recall that , over linearly ordered structures , the complexity class ptime is captured by least fixed - point logic  @xcite .",
    "a  formula @xmath6 with two free first - order variables @xmath7  and  @xmath8 _ defines a ( linear ) order _ on a relational structure  @xmath9 if the binary relation consisting of all pairs @xmath10 of elements of  @xmath9 satisfying @xmath11 is a linear order on  @xmath12 .",
    "we say that @xmath6 _ defines an order on a class of structures _ if it defines a linear order on each structure of that class .",
    "our objective is to provide combinatorial characterisations of classes of finite graphs whose representing structures are _",
    "@xmath0-orderable , _",
    "i.e. , on which one can define an order by an @xmath0-formula .",
    "( the question of whether a _ partial _ order is definable is trivial since equality is a partial order .",
    "therefore , we only consider linear orders in this article . )",
    "as defined above the notion of an @xmath0-orderable class is too restrictive . to get interesting results , we allow in the above definitions formulae with _ parameters . _",
    "that is , we take a formula @xmath13 with additional free set variables @xmath14 and , for each structure  @xmath9 in the given class , we choose values @xmath15 for these variables such that the binary relation @xmath16 is a linear order on  @xmath12 .",
    "there is no @xmath0-formula ( even with parameters ) that defines a linear order on all finite graphs .",
    "an easy way to see this is to observe that every ordered structure is _ rigid , _ i.e. , that it has no non - trivial automorphism .",
    "since we can find graphs that are not rigid , even after labelling them with a fixed number of parameters , it follows that no formula can order all graphs .",
    "the same argument shows that the following classes of finite graphs are not @xmath0-orderable.08em : ( 1 ) graphs without edges.08em ; ( 2 ) cliques.08em ; ( 3 ) stars.08em ; ( 4 ) trees of a fixed height.08em ; and ( 5 ) bipartite graphs . on the other hand , to take an easy example , the class of all finite connected graphs of degree at most  @xmath17 ( for fixed  @xmath17 ) is @xmath0-orderable .",
    "if graphs are replaced by their incidence graphs , @xmath0-formulae become more powerful , because they can use quantifications over sets of edges . in this case",
    "we speak of @xmath18-orderable classes .",
    "otherwise , we call the class @xmath19-orderable . due to the greater expressive power ,",
    "the family of @xmath18-orderable classes properly includes that of @xmath19-orderable ones .",
    "this means that , in the combinatorial characterisations presented below , the conditions for @xmath19-orderability must be stronger than those for @xmath18-orderability .",
    "for instance , the class of all cliques is @xmath18-orderable but not @xmath19-orderable .",
    "there are simple combinatorial criteria showing that a class is not @xmath0-orderable .",
    "for instance , a class of trees is not @xmath0-orderable if the degree of vertices is unbounded .",
    "the reason is that an @xmath0-formula can only distinguish between a bounded number of neighbours of a vertex .",
    "if the number of neighbours is too large , we can swap two of the attached subtrees without affecting the truth value of the formula .",
    "generalising this example , we obtain the following criterion for @xmath18-orderability.08em : if a class  @xmath20 is @xmath18-orderable , there exists a function  @xmath21 such that , whenever we remove  @xmath22 vertices from a graph in  @xmath20 , the resulting graph has at most @xmath23 connected components ( proposition  [ prop : sep boundend ] ) .    in many cases , it turns out that this necessary condition is also sufficient .",
    "for instance , we will prove in theorem  [ thm : gso - orderable with excluded minor ] below that a class of graphs omitting some graph as a minor is @xmath18-orderable if , and only if , it has the above property .",
    "this article is organised as follows .",
    "sections [ sect : preliminaries ]  and  [ sect : general orderability ] introduce notation and basic definitions .",
    "the main part consists of sections [ sect : mso2 ]  and  [ sect : mso ] , which collect our results on , respectively , @xmath18-orderability and @xmath19-orderability .    for @xmath18-orderability , we present a necessary condition in section  [ ssect : mso2-necessary ] .",
    "we prove that this condition is also sufficient for trees ( theorem  [ thm : orderability of trees ] ) and , more generally , for classes of graphs omitting some graph as a minor ( theorem  [ thm : gso - orderable with excluded minor ] ) .",
    "for some classes of bipartite graphs and of split graphs , we obtain a similar result , using a slightly stronger combinatorial condition ( theorems [ thm : gso - orderable d - partite graphs ]  and  [ thm : orderability of split graphs ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we prove that some classes are not @xmath18-orderable in a very strong sense.08em : they contain no infinite subclass that is @xmath18-orderable .",
    "this is the case for trees of bounded height ( corollary  [ cor : trees of bounded depth hereditarily mso2-unorderable ] ) and graphs of bounded @xmath24-depth tree - width ( proposition  [ prop : n - depth tree - width hereditarily mso2-unorderable ] ) .",
    "finally , we also prove that , for certain effectively presented classes of graphs , @xmath18-orderability is decidable ( corollary  [ cor : orderability decidable ] ) .    for @xmath19-orderability",
    "the picture we obtain is slightly more sketchy .",
    "we present a necessary condition for @xmath19-orderability in section  [ sect : mso orders ] .",
    "we prove that it is also sufficient for cographs ( theorem  [ thm : cographs ] ) and graphs of bounded @xmath24-depth @xmath25-width ( theorem  [ thm : characterisation of orderable graphs of bounded otimes - width ] ) .",
    "finally , we consider reductions between orderability properties in section  [ sect : reductions ] . we show that , for split graphs and bipartite graphs , the question of @xmath26-orderability is as hard as for arbitrary graphs .",
    "this indicates that we are far from having a combinatorial characterisation of orderability for such classes .",

    "we denote partial orders by symbols like @xmath33  and  @xmath34 , and the corresponding strict partial orders by @xmath35  and  @xmath36 , respectively .      in this article",
    "we consider only purely relational structures @xmath37 with finite signatures @xmath38 .",
    "the universe  @xmath12 will always be finite , and we allow it to be empty as this convention is common in graph theory . in some places we will also allow relational structures with constants , but when doing so we will always mention it explicitly . for a relation  @xmath39 and a set  @xmath2 , we write @xmath40 for the restriction of  @xmath39 to  @xmath2 . for a tuple @xmath41 of relations ,",
