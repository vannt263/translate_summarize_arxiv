    "the physical properties of vortex lines in the mixed phase of type ii superconductors has become subject of intense research in recent years @xcite . when an external current density is applied to the bulk of the system",
    ", the flux lines may start to move under the action of the lorentz force . within a perfectly homogeneous system this driving lorentz force",
    "is balanced only by the friction force opposing the steady state velocity of the flux lines , so that there is a dissipation coupled to the appearance of a finite electric field which results from the flux motion . to avoid this effect ,",
    "flux lines in the mixed phase should be pinned by inhomogeneities in the underlying crystal structure , such as the point defects associated with vacancies of oxygen atoms in high temperature cuprates @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the pinning of the vortices is much stronger when these impurities are in the form of correlated disorder , like twin boundaries or columnar defects@xcite , aligned along the direction of the external magnetic field .",
    "if the thermal fluctuations are small enough , the flux line may lie along the entire extended defect in the bulk ; this is in contrast to short scale disorder pinning , in which the line should accommodate itself to the potential fluctuations and hence increases its elastic energy .",
    "however , the correlated defects pinning becomes less effective when the direction of the external magnetic field is tilted with respect to the anisotropy axis , which we take to be along the @xmath1 direction . at some critical tilt , for which the free energy per unit length of the defect is less than the free energy associated with the perpendicular field , a pinning - depinning phase transition occurs and the flux lines are delocalized .    the static and dynamic response of the flux lines in the presence of columnar defects",
    "have been considered by nelson and vinokur @xcite .",
    "using the mapping of flux lines in @xmath2 dimensional superconductor to the world lines of bosons in a @xmath3dimensional quantum system , the authors identified the phase space diagram of the system which contains a high temperature `` superfluid '' and low - temperature `` bose glass '' phases , as well as mott insulator at the matching field , @xmath4 , for which there is one flux line per defect . at low temperature",
    ", this matching field separates the `` dilute '' region of the bose glass phase , for which the vortex lines are pinned individually by the defects , from the high density region , where interactions are important in determining the localization length and transport properties of the flux lines .    in the low field region ,",
    "the vortices are localized by the interaction with the correlated defects .",
    "each pin is the analog of a @xmath5 potential well which may be described ( up to logarithmic corrections ) as a cylindrical square well .",
    "the temperature of the superconductor , in turn , corresponds to the plank constant @xmath6 of the quantum boson system .",
    "for the dilute vortex arrays , where the pinning energy is larger than the interaction energy , there are two regimes . for low temperature the localization length is given approximately by the radius of the defect so that each flux line is localized by @xmath7 defect . as the temperature increases , the localization length of one defect grows exponentially with @xmath8 , and the flux line is then localized by several defects , forming an effective @xmath9 dimensional potential well in the corresponding boson system",
    ".    the depinning of flux line which occurs as a result of external field tilt has been carefully investigated by hatano and nelson @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the corresponding boson problem is no longer hermitian ; the kinetic term of the hamiltonian is subject to an imaginary gauge transformation where the gauge field @xmath10 is related to the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath11 via @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the flux quantum . in the absence of tilt ,",
    "the probability of finding a point of the vortex at transverse displacement @xmath14 relative to the center of the pin is independent of @xmath15 , and given by the square of @xmath16 , the ground - state wavefunction of the hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "for small tilt , there are left and right ground - state eigenfunctions which correspond to the left and right `` tilting '' of the hermitian ground - state are still localized .",
    "it turns out that the flux line is described by these left and right eigenfunction at the bottom and the top of the sample , while deep in the bulk the probability function approaches its hermitian limit .",
    "typically , the `` surface roughness '' associated with the tilt extends into the bulk up to some characteristic distance which diverges as the tilting angle approaches the critical angle , for which the flux line delocalizes and the current response becomes linear .    this non - hermitian delocalization process has been shown to be of importance for other physical systems as well . in general , the time evolution of diffusing scalar field in random environment is determined by the eigenstates of liouville operator which is the analog of the hermitian hamiltonian of a quantum particle in a disordered system ; the effect of convection may be modeled by the imaginary gauge transformation .",
    "the appearance of extended states as convection is increased beyond a critical value , associated with the complex spectral points of the resulting non - hermitian operator , is the manifestation of the delocalization transition .",
    "the dynamics of strongly driven charge density waves @xcite , and the growth modes of biological populations @xcite , are among the systems considered .",
    "in this paper we study this tilt induced delocalization transition at very dilute flux line concentrations , i.e. , near @xmath0 .",
    "we assume , therefore , that only the low - lying free energy states of the system are occupied , and that the repulsive interaction between vortices may be taken into account by sequential filling of energy levels .",
    "although this assumption is self consistent in the localized phase , it turns out that it is valid in the extanded phase only if the sample is finite .",
    "if the size of the sample is taken to infinity at finite vortex density , interaction may lead to a smecticlike flux crystal , as has been discussed in ref .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , a brief introduction to the boson - vortex analogy",
    "is presented , as well as the correspondence between the statistical mechanics of flux lines and the time evolution of a scalar field .",
    "section 3 deals with the finite size effects in the localized phase ; both the critical field @xmath0 and the penetration depth of the perpendicular field are shown to be determined by the statistics of the tail of the density of states . since this function",
    "is strongly related to the size of the system , physical properties of the pinned vortex are determined by the actual size of the bulk . in section 4",

    "@xmath24 is taken from some bounded distribution , such as square distribution of width @xmath27 around zero ; its bias , @xmath28 , is determined by @xmath22 and the parallel component of the external magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "note that we assume @xmath30 to be much smaller than @xmath31 , hence we neglect terms of order @xmath32 in ( 2.1 ) .    using the analogy between the partition function for this flux line , @xmath33 , and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics , it is easy to see that the conditional probability @xmath34 obeys the schroedinger - like equation , [ res1 ] -t z = - t^2 2 ^2 + [ a + u ( ) ] - t _ where @xmath35 is the dimensionless perpendicular field .",

    "for @xmath48 , the operator , @xmath49 $ ] , is hermitian and it is well known that , for strong enough disorder , all its eigenfunctions are real and localized ; the localization length is maximal at the center of the energy band , and minimal at the tails @xcite .",
    "when @xmath50 , the above hamiltonian is no longer hermitian , and it may be diagonlized using a system of left and right eigenvectors . since the perpendicular field term may be absorbed into the laplacian by completing the square , @xmath51 , the right and left eigenfunctions of the new hamiltonian are related to the eigenfunctions of @xmath52 via an imaginary gauge transformation ; if @xmath53 is an eigenfunction of the hermitian problem , then @xmath54 are the eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian operator with the _ same _ eigenvalue , provided that @xmath55 , the localization length in the non - driven problem , is less than @xmath56 .",
    "thus , for small tilt , there is a _ spectral rigidity _ - the eigenvalue spectrum is robust .",
    "when @xmath41 increases , the eigenfunctions become extended and the boundary conditions of the sample should be taken into account . since ( [ gauge ] ) , in general , does not satisfy these boundary conditions , the new eigenfunctions are no longer related to the @xmath48 case by a simple gauge transformation . as a result , the eigenvalues are changed ; in case of periodic boundary conditions , complex eigenvalues appear when @xmath56 becomes smaller then @xmath55 .",

    "this phenomenon is known as the transverse meissner effect . as has been shown by @xcite ,",
    "the ends of the pinned flux line begin to tear away from the pinning center as the tilt increases .",
    "the `` penetration depth '' of the perpendicular field , associated with the width of the region near the surface in which the transverse meissner effect breaks down , diverges as the tilt approaches @xmath59 . above this value ,",
    "the eigenstate delocalizes , and the resulting trajectory wanders across the entire sample .",
    "the lower critical field , @xmath0 , is defined in a random system as the minimal field in which the first vortex line enters the sample .",

    "this is in contrast to the discussion given by larkin and vinokur , who address the question of magnetic response for unbounded , gaussian random potential in an infinite sample .",
    "in such a case there is no well defined @xmath0 @xcite .    for a statistically homogeneous sample , any rare fluctuation",
    "is realized as one takes the bulk size to infinity . in particular",
    ", one may finds any large region in which the potential is close to its lower bound , so for infinite sample the minimal value of the potential @xmath60 sets the magnitude of @xmath0 , i.e. , h_c1^ = 4 ( - ) _ 0 . for finite sample",
    "this is not the case . typically , as the sample size increases , @xmath61 ; however , the form of the size dependence of the critical magnetic field is not trivial .",
    "consider , for example , a hole in the superconductor , i.e. , a region of linear size @xmath62 where the elastic energy of the flux line vanishes , @xmath63 .",
    "the free energy of a vortex line which is trapped in this hole comes entirely from the limits on its transverse motion sets by the boundaries of this hole .",
    "far away from the bulk critical temperature ( i.e. , when @xmath22 in the bulk is much bigger than the typical free energy per unit length associated with the trapped flux line ) one may assume no vortex displacement along the hole boundaries , and the situation corresponds to a quantum mechanical particle in a box .",
    "in such a case the tail of the spectrum of ( 2.4 ) looks like ( k ) ~d k^2 , where the minimal value of @xmath64 is sets by the system linear size @xmath62 , @xmath65 , so that , h_c1 ~4 t^2 _ 0 l^2 .",
    "this result reflects the fact that the entropy of the vortex line decreases if it is confined to finite region , hence its free energy per unit length increases . at zero temperature",
    "this finite size correction to @xmath0 disappears ; as the temperature approaches its critical value , the potential steps at the hole boundaries become small , and in 2d this contribution to the free energy vanishes exponentially .",
    "let us consider now the disordered case . in appendix",
    "a we show that for a simple lattice model with square distribution of the disorder the density of states per unit volume near the minimal possible value of the energy ( which we set , for convenience , to zero since this value is absorbed in the definition of @xmath66 ) is g ( ) ~e^-(d l_0 ^ 2 ) ^d/2 where @xmath67 is the lattice constant .",
    "one may estimate the energy difference @xmath68 between the ground state and zero for a typical sample of linear size @xmath62 by the condition ( l l_0)^d g()~1 so for large samples the ground state energy is given by _",

    "in contrast to the hole example , one sees that the critical parallel field approaches @xmath66 much slower , i.e. , finite size effects are much stronger in the presence of disorder . for the tilt field below its critical value",
    "the situation remains the same , since the spectrum does not change .    upon taking reasonable parameters for high temperature superconductors , such as @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ,",
    "one finds , however , that the entropic corrections to @xmath66 are very small , @xmath72 .",
    "thus , for almost any realistic sample size one could take the value of @xmath66 as the lower critical field .",
    "since in most cases the radius of the columnar pins is comparable to , or bigger than , the superconducting coherence length , the range of the external field corresponding to the meissner phase turns out to be very narrow . for other physical situations when",

    "calculation of @xmath154 in some limits of a simple model are presented in appendix b. it is shown that the effective disorder strength diverges as @xmath155 as @xmath139 approaches the critical field from above .",
    "since actual systems are of finite size , it may lead to completely different response to the external drift . in the directed polymer phase ,",
    "the disorder strength and the tilt modulus lead to a length scale @xmath156 , above which the polymer adapts itself to the pinning potential .",
    "below @xmath156 , the line remains stiff , since the fluctuations of the pinning energy grows only sublinearly with length @xcite .",

    "= 1^d ( k _ ) where @xmath206 , thus , the tail states obey the relation ~v - t + t / r^2 so that the result ( [ qqq ] ) is applicable here also , with the energy measured from the lower bound of the band .",
    "in this appendix we study the response of the bulk magnetization @xmath207 to the tilt of the external field . in the localized phase there is no linear response , i.e. , no bulk tilt of the vortex as a result of the external perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "thus , our discussion here is relevant only in the extended phase .",
    "it is important to note that for an _ unbounded _ distribution of defects strength , such as a gaussian distribution , one flux line is always localized . for a given tilt",
    ", there is always a strong enough defect such that the localization length is small enough and the tilted state is localized .",
    "a delocalization of one flux line may occur only if the distribution of the defects is bounded .",
    "we will take the quenched random potential from a distribution of width @xmath27 , so that the minimal localization length is of order @xmath208 .",
    "the tilt is assumed to be strong such that all the states are localized .    the typical situation , though , is that the flux line `` lives '' , for a while , on defects which are quite strong with respect to their neighbors , i.e. , there are no stronger defects in the vicinity of the strong one . after a while , however , the flux line is going to jump to another defect which is weaker , in order to satisfy the tilt term in the free energy .",
    "this process may be described by the optimization of the free energy of the `` local jump '' [ fe ] f = -(1 + g ( ) r^d ) - ( z ) dz , where @xmath209 is the length that the flux line spend on the defect . the first term in ( [ fe ] ) indicates that there is a decrease of the free energy due to the fact that the flux line lives on the defect .",
    "this decrease is proportional to the potential energy difference between the current site and the site the flux line jumps to ; it is bounded from above by @xmath27 while it decreases to zero when the jump distance , @xmath102 , is much bigger than the density of states per unit area , since then the flux line may find another strong defect .",
    "the denominator of the first term in ( [ fe ] ) reflects the simplest interpolation between these two limits .",
    "the term @xmath210 indicates the free energy per unit length decrease since the flux line average direction @xmath211 tends to be in the direction of the external magnetic field @xmath212 . in terms of the `` local jump '' ,",
    "this term takes the form = h _ 0 4 ( ^2 + r^2)^1/2 \\{atg[h_h_| ] - atg[r ] } .",
    "now let us calculate the effective tilt of the flux line , i.e. , the response of the internal magnetic field @xmath211 to the external field @xmath212 .",
    "for @xmath212 in the direction of the defects , @xmath211 is parallel to @xmath213 ; this is also true if @xmath212 is perpendicular to the defects .",
    "small tilt of @xmath212 from the defects direction is not enough to tilt the flux line , so that there is no response of the internal magnetic field ( except near the surface , see @xcite ) . above the critical tilt",
    "there is linear response of the flux line , i.e. , @xmath214 , where @xmath215 as @xmath216 and @xmath217 approaches @xmath218 as @xmath219 . using our local jump model , near @xmath220 i.e , where @xmath221 and @xmath222 ; near the critical tilt @xmath223 , so that we may assume that @xmath224 .",
    "@xmath225 then takes the form f = - + h _ 0 8 ^2 .",
    "optimizing with respect to @xmath209 one gets [ ( h_h_|)^2 - ( r ) ^2 ] . since , in this limit @xmath226 and @xmath227 , and using the definition @xmath228 , we have b_^2 = h_^2 - i.e. , below @xmath229 there is no response to the external tilt while above @xmath230 @xmath231 where @xmath232 .",
    "this analysis is valid for the region in which both @xmath207 and @xmath30 are much smaller than one , and the resulting @xmath102 is small compared to @xmath233 .    in the opposite limit , where the external magnetic field is perpendicular to the defects",
    ", @xmath102 is much bigger than both @xmath209 and @xmath233 , thus the first term is negligible and the flux line is parallel to the external field .",
    "the above treatment was for one jump , i.e. , it neglects global effects of the defects . for the actual @xmath207 , one should take the typical defect instead of the extreme one .",
    "however , we may use the same analysis in order to get the `` time '' , @xmath209 , spent by the flux line on a particular defect , by dividing the radius of the defect by the `` local velocity '' , i.e. , the associated perpendicular part of the internal magnetic field , associated with it .",
    "the result is ( u ) ~r_0 b _ ~r_0 where @xmath234 is the radius of the defect .",
    "thus , the effective energy associated with a defect of potential energy @xmath235 is tilt dependent ; as one approaches the critical tilt for this defect , @xmath236 , the effective energy @xmath237 diverges as @xmath238 .",
    "( this is in agreement with the result for @xmath239 from the localized limit , i.e. , by equating the typical inverse localization length @xmath240 to the @xmath241 term in the gauge transformation @xcite ) .",
