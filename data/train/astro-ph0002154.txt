    "the determination of the three - dimensional matter distribution in planetary nebulae is essential for a knowledge of the nebula ejection mechanism .",
    "a precise understanding of the nebula geometry which produces the observed morphology can also provide constraints on stellar evolution theories .",
    "the geometry and the density distribution of pne are generally derived from line imaging , assuming that a surface brightness enhancement corresponds to a density enhancement .",
    "after a first descriptive study of the morphology of pne ( curtis 1918 ) , more detailed studies indicate two different interpretations for the observed morphology of these objects : a ) the different observed morphologies are due to different projections of a same common basic structure ( minkowski & osterbrock 1960 , khromov & kohoutek 1968 ) ; b ) the different types in which pne can be classified ( bipolar , elliptical , etc . )",
    "correspond to different evolutionary stages ( balick 1987 ) . in this second approach",
    ", the morphology can also be related to the nebular and stellar properties , particularly the mass of the progenitor star ( e.g. peimbert & torres - peimbert 1983 , calvet & peimbert 1983 , stanghellini , corradi & schwarz 1993 , corradi & schwarz 1995 ) .",
    "this point of view is corroborated by the studies of zhang & kwok ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors , assuming a three - dimensional ellipsoidal shell with density variations and a complete absorption of the ionizing photons , which are reconverted in h recombination photons , produce simulated radio and h@xmath3 images which are compared to the observations .",
    "the visual appearence of pne were also compared with models obtained for ionization - bounded prolate shells by masson ( 1990 ) .",
    "assuming an ellipsoidal shell with constant thickness and that the ionizing radiation is geometrically diluted , masson ( 1990 ) compared theoretical and observed h@xmath3 images .",
    "however , a given emission line image results from the sum of line intensities along the line of sight . the exact location of the regions which produce each line depends on the gas density distribution , but also on the ionization distribution , which , in turn , depends on the characteristics of the ionizing star and on the nebular gas abundance .",
    "consequently , different emission lines provides information on different regions of the nebula , and only a consistent photoionization model applied to a realistic gas structure can give an accurate density distribution on the nebula .    in this paper",
    "we show that the geometry of a pn derived by fitting the observed image of a line emission and/or a line intensity ratio is misleading , since different geometries can reproduce the same observational data .",
    "other constraints , coupled with a detailed 3d photoionization model , must be used for better defining the geometry , as illustrated by the planetary nebula ngc  3132 .",
    "based on emission line imaging , an ellipsoidal geometry for ngc  3132 is assumed by various authors .",
    "such a geometry is then suggested in a first approach .",
    "studies similar to that of masson ( 1990 ) using a prolate shell could explain the observed morphology of ngc  3132 .",
    "notice that the ellipsoidal shell model of zhang & kwok ( 1998 ) also reproduces the general trends of the observed h@xmath3 image of ngc  3132 . using a geometry defined by two concentric ellipsoids and a 3d photoionization code , bssgen , diesch & grewing ( 1990 , hereafter @xcite )",
    "fit the observed [ ] and [ ] line images , as well as the emission line spectra taken through four slits .",
    "spatio - kinematic models for ngc  3132 were proposed by sahu & desai ( 1986 , hereafter @xcite ) to explain the observed asymmetric double - peaked [ ] @xmath05007 line profiles in five positions .",
    "@xcite assert that an ellipsoidal model with velocity and density asymmetries reproduces the observed expansion velocities and correctly explains the nature of the profile asymmetries .",
    "however , in their paper , only the fit to the line profile at the central position is shown .",
    "line profiles , as a powerful tool for studying the nebula geometry , are discussed by morisset , gruenwald & viegas ( 2000 , hereafter mgv2000 ) .",
    "as it will be shown below , all the models assuming an ellipsoidal emitting shell lead to the same problems : neither can reproduce the low central density observed by @xcite and @xcite nor the observed asymmetric double - peaked profiles in regions far from the center of the nebula . after a description of the available observations of ngc  3132 (  [ sec - obs ] ) , we show that ellipsoidal shell models do not reproduce all the available observations (  [ sec - bass ] ) .",

    "the conclusions are outlined in  [ sec - concl ] .",
    "a consistent photoionization model giving a realistic description of a pn has to account for all the observational data coming from different types of observation . in the following",
    ", a summary of the data available for ngc  3132 is presented .",
    "the logarithm of the observed h@xmath4 flux ranges from -10.49 ( @xcite ) to -10.20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the extinction e(b - v ) is of the order of 0.1 ( @xcite , mendez 1978 , feibelman 1982 , gathier , pottasch & pel 1986 ) .",
    "the calculated values for the zanstra temperature of the ionizing star of ngc  3132 ranges from 73 000 k ( de freitas pacheco , codina & viadana 1986 ) to 110 000 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "distance determinations indicate values from @xmath6 0.51 kpc ( @xcite , pottasch 1996 ) to 1.63 kpc ( torres - peimbert & peimbert 1977 ) .",

    "high resolution spectra for [ ] @xmath05007 in five positions were obtained by @xcite , who also deduced a velocity of 14 / at the central position .",
    "the line profiles are all asymmetrical and double peaked",
    ". since the observed red peak is more intense towards the center , the asymmetry can not be due to local absorption .",
    "electronic densities are generally obtained from the [ ] or [ ] line intensity ratios corresponding to intensities integrated on a slit .",
    "@xcite obtained 1000 @xmath9 , while @xcite and stanghellini & kaler ( 1989 ) give , respectively , 600 @xmath9 and 430 @xmath9 .",
    "more detailed observations show a variation of the electronic density measured in different positions .",
    "density determination by @xcite , from the [ ] @xmath86717,6731 line intensity ratio , shows a double - peaked distribution along the ns direction , reaching up to 1300 @xmath9 at the periphery of the nebula and decreasing to 300 @xmath9 at the central position .",
    "recent observations have confirmed this density distribution trend ( monteiro , gruenwald & de souza , in preparation ) . _",
    "it will be shown that the decrease in density at the central region is the key observation that rules out the description of ngc  3132 as a geometrical ellipsoidal shell . _",
    "the 3d photoionization code used in this paper is described in gruenwald , viegas & broguire ( 1997 ) .",
    "the output of the code is treated by idl tools performing rotations , projections , and velocity profiles .",
    "a full description of these tools is given by mgv2000 .    in order to fit the observed morphology of ngc  3132 ( [ ] @xmath05007 and [ ] @xmath06583 line images ) , as well as the emission line spectra taken through 4 slits",
    ", @xcite proposed a model obtained by a 3d photoionization code .",
    "the geometry and input parameters proposed by @xcite are taken as a starting point for our 3d model of ngc  3132 .",
    "elements heavier than ne were not included in @xcite model . for s , cl , and ar we assumed a solar abundance ( @xcite ) , while mg , s , cl , and fe are depleted by one hundred ( stasinska & tylenda 1986 ) .",
    "thus , the gas chemical abundance , in number , is : h : 1.0 , he : 0.126 , c : 7.1(-4 ) , n : 2(-4 ) , o : 6(-4 ) , ne : 8.2(-5 ) , mg : 3.8(-7 ) , si : 3.55(-7 ) , s : 1.62(-5 ) , cl : 3.16(-7 ) , ar : 3.6(-6 ) , fe : 4.7(-7 ) .",
    "the central ionizing radiation is a black - body of 90  000  k and 150  l@xmath10 .",
    "the model consists of two prolate ellipsoids defining a shell and an inner cavity ( the outer zone being empty ) .",
    "the inner ellipsoid has a semi - minor axis of 1.27 @xmath11 cm and a semi - major axis of 2.32 @xmath11 cm , while the outer one has 1.96 @xmath11 cm and 2.45 @xmath11 cm , respectively .",
    "the density in the inner cavity is constant ( 464 @xmath9 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the shell density varies along the three directions . here only the most important density gradient ( along the major axis z ) is assumed .",
    "it varies from @xmath6 1200 @xmath9 at one pole to @xmath6 900 @xmath9 at the opposite pole .",
    "this gradient is needed in order to reproduce the observed asymmetrical brightness enhancement shown by the optical images .",
    "the calculations are performed assuming the on - the - spot approximation ( see mgv2000 ) .",
    "initially the cube containing 1/8 the nebula is divided in @xmath12 cells . in order to improve the numerical resolution ,",
    "some of these cells are subdivided , resulting in 133 000 cells .",
    "once the calculations converged , the whole nebula is recovered ( see mgv2000 ) . following @xcite ,",
    "the images are obtained after a 7/.5 rotation around the x axis ( perpendicular to the line of sight ) .",
    "the results obtained by @xcite for the line intensities are not reproduced by our ellipsoidal model .",
    "first , the geometrical thickness of the shell , adopted by these authors , is not large enough to absorb all the photons .",
    "our model with the @xcite geometry leads to a matter - bound ( m - bound ) nebula .",
    "the model is then unable to reproduce the observed [ ] @xmath85198,5200 strong lines , characteristic of a radiation bound nebula .",
    "notice that the measured intensity for [ ] @xmath06300 , @xmath6 0.3 / ( torres - peimbert & peimbert 1977 ) , also indicates that the nebula must be mainly radiation - bound ( r - bound ) .",
    "although the details of the @xcite code are not available in their paper , the difference with our results may come from the optical depth calculation , which is the key - parameter determining the model .",
    "models with a low number of cells ( which implies too large cells ) tend to overestimate the optical depth . in this case , for the same geometrical thickness , the model would be r - bound instead of m - bound .",
    "our model has 40 times more cells than @xcite .",
    "this can explain why , using the same input parameters , our model is m - bound while theirs is r - bound . in order to have a r - bound shell , reproducing the observed low - ionization emission lines , the outer ellipsoid size must be increased by at least 20% .",
    "a second reason for the discrepancies between our model and that of @xcite is the lack of elements heavier than ne in their code , which leads to an underestimation of the cooling processes . in order to test this effect ,",
    "a heavy - element free-@xcite model was built .",
    "the [ ] @xmath05007 and [ ] @xmath06583 line intensities ( relative to / ) increase , respectively , by 30@xmath13 and 16@xmath13 .",
    "this can partly explain the differences with @xcite results , since the optical depth effect , discussed above , must be also important .    in the following",
    ", we will refer to the matter - bound model using the dimensions of @xcite as the m-@xcite model and to the 20@xmath13 `` extended ''",
    "radiation - bound model as the r-@xcite model .",
    "the results of both models are presented in table [ tab - obs ] . as expected ,",
    "the stronger differences appear for the low ionization lines ( [ ] @xmath85198,5200 and [ ] @xmath06300 ) . nevertheless , even the r-@xcite model is far from reproducing the results obtained by @xcite , as discussed below .",
    "the superposition of the [ ] @xmath06583 hst image and the theoretical isophotes obtained from the r-@xcite model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - hst - b90 ] . the shape is well reproduced , as well as the variation of the surface brightness along the major axis . to adjust the modeled shape and dimensions to the observed ones ,",
    "a reduction of 4@xmath13 in the distance used by @xcite ( 670 pc ) is necessary .",
    "note that this new value for the distance is in the range of the calculated distances to ngc  3132 (  2 ) for a comparison of our results with the observations of @xcite , the theoretical n - s density distribution is calculated from the theoretical [ ] @xmath86717,6731 ratio ( using the @xcite fit ) for a 4 \" width slit , centered on the nebula . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig - sii - dens ] , this model assuming an ellipsoidal geometry ( dashed line ) does not reproduce the observed central decrease in density . in order to obtain the theoretical [ ] @xmath05007 emission line profiles ,",
    "a radial velocity law @xmath14 is used .",
    "three possible sets of @xmath3 and @xmath4 values are assumed : @xmath15 / and @xmath16 km s@xmath1 cm@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the normalization factor , @xmath18 = 3 10@xmath19 cm , is of the order of the size of the nebula .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 emission line mean velocities for the whole nebula ( as defined in mgv2000 ) are given in table [ tab - velo ] .",
    "for the three sets of values defining the velocity law , the parameters were chosen in order to give @xmath20 = 14.7 / , as obtained from the observed profile reported by @xcite .",
    "the corresponding theoretical @xmath21 mean velocity depends on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 and is always slightly lower than the observed value ( 21 / ) .",
    "the five positions at which the [ ] @xmath05007 line profiles were observed are shown in @xcite ( their fig .",
    "1a ) superposed on an u - band image ( kohoutek & lausten 1977 ) .",
    "the calculated velocity profiles for [ ] @xmath05007 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - velo - b90 ] . since the three sets of parameters of the adopted velocity law give similar line profiles , only the results for the @xmath22 / and @xmath23 km s@xmath1 cm@xmath1 law is shown . in the upper - right panel",
    "the aperture is shifted from the center by 2.8  ne .",
    "this shift corresponds to the pointing accuracy of the telescope used by @xcite and it allows to check if the effect of the pointing precision on the profile is important .",
    "the central double peak is reproduced .",
    "however , the observed asymmetry can only be obtained if the nebula is tilted by about 30/ , whereas the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - velo - b90 ] were obtained assuming a rotation angle of 7/.5 , as proposed by bdg90 .",
    "the observed double peaks at the four external positions are not reproduced .",
    "note that the observed profiles were taken by sd86 at positions where the u band emission is strongest . in the u band ,",
    "the nebular emission is dominated by the [ ] @xmath03726 line , so the observations were taken at the extreme outer part of the nebula .",
    "thus , the radial velocity at these positions is quasi - perpendicular to the line of sight and an apparent velocity of @xmath6 10 / would require an unrealistic high radial velocity .",
    "finally , a simple way to verify the inadequacy of the ellipsoidal model in reproducing the density gradient and the low ionization lines is the following : let us consider a dense shell ( @xmath6 1000 @xmath9 ) with a geometrical thickness @xmath24 and radius @xmath25 , around a less dense cavity ( @xmath6 300 @xmath9 ) .",
    "the line emissivity is proportional to the square of the density .",
    "thus , in order to reproduce the observed density distribution , the main contribution to the central emission must come from the low density gas , implying @xmath26 .",
    "such a thin shell will have a total emissivity far below the observed one , and will be matter - bound , not producing the low ionization lines . a radiation - bound model , necessary to explain the low ionization lines can not reproduce the density gradient as shown above .",
    "this rules out the description of ngc  3132 as a _ closed ellipsoidal shell_. an ellipsoidal shell with a hole just aligned to the central line of sight could be proposed , but such an _ ad hoc _ geometry seems unrealistic .    from all the results presented above we conclude that an ellipsoidal model for ngc  3132 is not appropriate to explain the observational data .",
    "thus , a new model is proposed below .",
    "pne imaging suggests that several objects can have a `` diabolo '' shape ( e.g. hour - glass nebula and ngc 2346 ) . in order to reproduce this shape ,",
    "we adopt a two - zone gas distribution , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - densh4 ] : a ) a dense zone ( with a density of 1300 @xmath9 ) defined by the intersection of two spheres of the same radius ( 3 .",
    "10@xmath19 cm ) but with centers shifted by 10@xmath19 cm , defining the `` diabolo - shape '' , and b ) a low - density gas , 300 @xmath9 , filling the rest of the nebula .",
    "the shadowing in the figure is just used to give a better 3d visualization and does not correspond to a density variation .",
    "the model was calculated for 1/8 of the nebula and the whole nebula was reconstructed in a 10@xmath27 cells cube .",
    "we keep the chemical abundances and ionizing star characteristics of @xcite model (  [ sec - bass ] ) .",
    "no attempt to adjust these parameters were made in order to improve the fit of the emission line ratios .",
    "in fact , the scope of this paper is just to show that a strong constraint on the geometry is the density distribution . once this distribution is reproduced , other observed features , unexplained by previous models , can also be explained .",
    "the effect of varying the angle of view of the nebula is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - diab - rot ] .",
    "practically all the observed regular morphologies of pne are reproduced : from a clearly butterfly image ( axis of symmetry perpendicular to the line of sight ) to a well round nebula ( axis of symmetry aligned to the line of sight ) through an ellipsoidal one . with an appropriate orientation of 40/ relative to the line of sight ,",
    "the observed optical shape of ngc  3132 ( ellipsoidal shape ) can be reproduced .",
    "as said above (  1 ) , such feature can also be reproduced by the ellipsoidal shell model of zhang & kwok ( 1998 ) , as well as by a model similar to that of masson ( 1990 ) . however , these models are not self - consistent with respect to the ionization balance and , as will be shown below , other constraints will rule out an ellipsoidal model for this nebula .    with a / morphology the contribution from the dense region to the central emission",
    "is reduced , helping to solve the close ellipsoidal shell problems . at the same time",
    ", the projected velocity of the gas in the external parts of the nebula will be high enough , reproducing the observed double peak , as shown below .    regarding the emission line ratios , the results of the / model ( fourth column of table [ tab - obs ] ) are similar to those obtained from the r-@xcite model .",
    "in addition , hst line images in h@xmath4 , [ ] @xmath05007 , [ ] @xmath06583 and [ ] @xmath06300 are shown fig .",
    "[ fig - ima - diab ] ( four upper panels ) and can be compared to the corresponding / model images ( four lower panels ) .",
    "the observed ellipsoidal shape is well reproduced , as well as the ionization stratification .",
    "the brightness asymmetry along the major axis is not reproduced by the adopted axi - symmetrical model of the nebula .",
    "such asymmetry could be explained either by a density gradient or an ionization source that is not in the geometrical center of the diabolo .",
    "the electronic density distribution obtained from the [ ] @xmath86717,6731 ratio is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sii - dens ] ( solid line ) . _ the observed decrease of the density (  2 ) in the central part of the nebula is reproduced_. this and the line profiles discussed below are the main improvements obtained by the diabolo shape .",
    "the same velocity laws applied for the r - bdg90 model are used (  3.2 ) with @xmath18 = 5 10@xmath19 cm .",
    "the three different [ ] @xmath05007 profiles obtained with the three sets of parameters of the velocity law are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - prof - diab ] and can be compared to the observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the profiles show the double peaks at the six positions , _ a feature not reproduced by the ellipsoidal shell model_. the asymmetry is well reproduced at the four external positions .",
    "the asymmetry at the central position is not reproduced , as long as an axi - symmetric nebula is used , even considering a shift of 2.8  as shown in the upper right panel .",
    "notice that at the central position only the low density gas contributes to the emission .",
    "thus , any asymmetry in the velocity field and/or in the low density distribution will lead to the observed asymmetry , requiring no change in the higher density distribution associated to the / shape .",
    "the three sets of parameters for the velocity law were chosen in order to obtain the same @xmath20 ( 14.7 / , table [ tab - velo ] ; the results for @xmath21 remain the same as for the r - bdg90 models ) ; however , for @xmath3 = 0 ( dashed lines ) , the peaks of the observed profiles at the central part of the nebula occur for a lower velocity ( fig .",

    "furthermore , in this case , the velocity law does not reproduce the observed profiles since one of the peaks is almost inexistent .",

    "we have shown in this paper that the lack of high resolution observations ( spatial and spectroscopic ) may lead to a wrong conclusion about the morphology of a pn .",
    "a new modeling tool based on a 3d photoionization code is used to consistently reproduce all the available observations of ngc  3132 . using an ellipsoidal geometry , all the low resolution observations ( flux , emission line spectrum , imaging )",
    "could be reproduced . however",
    ", neither the density variations indicated by the [ ] @xmath86717,6731 ratio , nor the [ ] @xmath05007 velocity profiles could be explained by such a model . to account for these observations ,",
    "a drastic change in the geometry of the nebula is necessary .",
    "the proposed diabolo shape offers the solution to the density distribution , as well as to the asymmetric double - peaked emission line profiles , while also explaining the low resolution observations .",
    "a diabolo shape may reproduce the observed bipolar morphology of many pne .",
    "in fact , bryce , balick & meaburn ( 1994 ) suggested that ngc  6720 is not a spherical expanding shell as often assumed , but must be bipolar in nature , since the observed [ nii ] emission line profiles are split in two components .",
    "a bipolar shape emerges from studies of the formation and evolution of pne , in particular those related to the interacting wind model ( kwok , purton , & fitzgerald 1978 ) .",
    "recent hydrodynamical models ( e.g. dwarkadas , chevalier & blondin 1996 ; @xcite ) suggest that a diabolo type shape can be produced in the accepted scenario of pne formation ( post agb envelope ejection with wind interaction ) .",
    "in fact , recent high resolution images taken with the hubble space telescope show that pne with this type of structure is not uncommon .",
    "some nice examples are the hour - glass nebula , ngc  2346 , ngc  6537 and hb-5 .",
    "no attempt was made to fine tuning the emission line ratios .",
    "this can be achieved through changes in the ionizing star characteristics , in the chemical abundances , as well as through small adjustments in the density distribution , which will not change the main conclusions of this paper , in particular the diabolo shape .",
    "furthermore , in the models presented here , the ionizing source is assumed to be at the center of symmetry of the nebula . however , there are evidences that the star should be shifted by @xmath6 1.7  from the geometrical center of the nebula ( kohoutek & lausten 1977 and @xcite )",
    ". a model accounting for this out - of - center ionizing star may still improve the results , leading to a better agreement with the observations regarding the brightness asymmetry and the emission line profile at the central position .",
    "we have shown here the importance of a 3d photoionization model , combined with imaging results and also with high resolution observations , to impose relevant constraints on the pn geometry .",
    "the misclassification of ngc  3132 as an ellipsoidal pn instead of a bipolar one casts doubts on the statistical results correlating the morphology and other pne properties , such as abundances or progenitor type .",
