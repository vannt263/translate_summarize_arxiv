    "in the past decade , observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ; riess et al .",
    "1998 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations ( bennett et al . 2003 ; spergel et al . 2003 , 2007 ) , and large - scale structures ( lss ; tegmark et al . 2004 , 2006 ) have been used to explore cosmology extensively .",
    "these observations are found to be consistent with the so - called concordance cosmology , in which the universe is spatially flat and contains pressureless matter and dark energy , with fractional energy densities of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( davis et al .",
    "observations of sn ia provide a powerful probe in the modern cosmology .",
    "phillips ( 1993 ) found that there is an intrinsic relation between the peak luminosity and the shape of the light curve of sne ia .",
    "this relation and other similar luminosity relations make sne ia standard candles for measuring the geometry and dynamics of the universe .",
    "however , the maximum redshift of the sne ia which we can currently use is only about 1.7 , whereas fluctuations of the cmb provide the cosmological information from last scattering surface at @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the earlier universe at higher redshift may not be well - studied without data from standardized candles in the `` cosmological desert '' from the sne  ia redshift limit to @xmath9 .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most intense explosions observed so far .",
    "their high energy photons in the gamma - ray band are almost immune to dust extinction , whereas in the case of sn ia observations , there is extinction from the interstellar medium when optical photons propagate towards us .",
    "moreover , grbs are likely to occur in the high - redshift range up to at least @xmath10 ( krimm et al .",
    "2006 ) ; higher redshift grbs up to @xmath11 should have already been detected , although none have been identified ( lamb & reichart 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2002 , 2006 ; lin , zhang , & li 2004 ) .",
    "thus , by using grbs , we may explore the early universe in the high redshift range which is difficult to access by other cosmological probes .",
    "these advantages make grbs attractive for cosmology research .",
    "grb luminosity / energy relations are connections between measurable properties of the prompt gamma - ray emission and the luminosity or energy . in recent years",
    ", several empirical grb luminosity relations have been proposed as distance indicators ( see e.g. ghirlanda et al .",
    "2006a ; schaefer ( 2007 ) for reviews ) , such as the luminosity - spectral lag ( @xmath12-@xmath13 ) relation ( norris , marani , & bonnell 2000 ) , the luminosity - variability ( @xmath12-@xmath14 ) relation ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ; reichart et al .",
    "2001 ) , the isotropic energy - peak spectral energy ( ( @xmath15-@xmath16 ) relation ( i.e. , the so - called amati relation , amati et al .",
    "2002 ) , the collimation - corrected energy - peak spectral energy ( @xmath17-@xmath16 ) relation ( i.e. , the so - called ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004a ) , the @xmath12-@xmath16 relation ( schaefer 2003a ; yonetoku et al . 2004 ) , and two multi - variable relations .",
    "the first of these multiple relations is between @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the break time of the optical afterglow light curves @xmath18",
    "( i.e. , the so - called liang - zhang relation , liang & zhang 2005 ) ; the other is between luminosity , @xmath16 and the rest - frame `` high - signal '' timescale ( @xmath19 ) ( firmani et al . 2006 ) .",
    "several authors have made use of these grb luminosity indicators as standard candles at very high redshift for cosmology research ( e.g. schaefer 2003b ; dai et al .",
    "2004 ; ghirlanda et al . 2004b ; firmani et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007 ; liang & zhang 2005 ; xu et al . 2005 ; wang & dai 2006 ; see also e.g. ghirlanda et al .",
    "2006a and schaefer ( 2007 ) for reviews ) .",
    "schaefer ( 2003b ) derived the luminosity distances of nine grbs with known redshifts by using two grb luminosity relations to construct the first grb hubble diagram .",
    "dai et al .",
    "( 2004 ) considered the ghirlanda relation with 12 bursts and proposed another approach to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "liang & zhang ( 2005 ) constrained cosmological parameters and the transition redshift using the @xmath15-@xmath16-@xmath20 relation .",
    "more recently , schaefer ( 2007 ) used five grb relations calibrated with 69 grbs by assuming two adopted cosmological models to obtain the derived distance moduli for plotting the hubble diagram , and joint constraints on the cosmological parameters and dark energy models have been derived in many works by combining the 69 grb data with sne ia and the other cosmological probes , such as the cmb anisotropy , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak , the x - ray gas mass fraction in clusters , the linear growth rate of perturbations , and the angular diameter distances to radio galaxies ( wright 2007 ; wang et al .",
    "2007 ; li et al . 2008",
    "; qi et al . 2008 ; daly et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "however , an important point related to the use of grbs for cosmology is the dependence on the cosmological model in the calibration of grb relations . in the case of sn ia cosmology",
    ", the calibration is carried out with a sample of sne ia at very low redshift where the luminosities of sne ia are essentially independent of any cosmological model ( i.e. , at @xmath21 , the luminosity distance has a negligible dependence on the choice of the model ) . however , in the case of grbs , the observed long - grb rate falls off rapidly at low redshifts , and some nearby grbs may be intrinsically different ( e.g. , grb 980425 , grb 031203 ; norris 2002 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2004 ; guetta et al .",
    "2004 ; liang & zhang 2006a ) .",
    "therefore , it is very difficult to calibrate the relations with a low - redshift sample .",
    "the relations of grbs presented above have been calibrated by assuming a particular cosmological model ( e.g. the @xmath3cdm model ) . in order to investigate cosmology ,",
    "the relations of standard candles should be calibrated in a cosmological model - independent way .",
    "otherwise , the circularity problem can not easily be avoided .",
    "many of the works mentioned above treat the circularity problem with a statistical approach .",
    "a simultaneous fit of the parameters in the calibration curves and the cosmology is carried out to find the optimal grb relation and the optimal cosmological model in the sense of a minimum scattering in both the luminosity relations and the hubble diagram .",
    "firmani et al .",
    "( 2005 ) has also proposed a bayesian method to get around the circularity problem .",
    "( 2008b ) presented another new method to deal with the problem , using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) global fitting analysis . instead of a hybrid sample over the whole redshift range of grbs , takahashi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) first calibrated two grb relations at low redshift ( @xmath22 ) , where distance - redshift relations have been already determined from sn ia ; they then used grbs at high redshift ( @xmath23 ) as a distance indicator .",
    "bertolami & silva ( 2006 ) considered the use of grbs at @xmath24 calibrated with the bursts at @xmath25 as distance markers to study the unification of dark energy and dark matter in the context of the generalized chaplygin gas model .",
    "schaefer ( 2007 ) made a detailed comparison between the hubble diagram calibrated only with 37 bursts at @xmath26 and the one calibrated with the data from all 69 grbs to show that the results from fits to the grb hubble diagram calibrated with the hybrid sample are robust .",
    "these calibration methods above carried out with the sample at low redshifts have been derived from the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "however , we note that the circularity problem can not be circumvented completely by means of statistical approaches , because a particular cosmology model is required in doing the joint fitting .",
    "this means that the parameters of the calibrated relations are still coupled to the cosmological parameters derived from a given cosmological model . in principle , the circularity problem can be avoided in two ways ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2006a ) : ( 1 ) through a solid physical interpretation of these relations that would fix their slope independently from cosmological model , or ( 2 ) through the calibration of these relations by several low - redshift grbs .",
    "recently the possibility of calibrating the standard candles using grbs in a low - dispersion in redshift near a fiducial redshift has been proposed ( lamb et al . 2005 ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "liang & zhang ( 2006b ) elaborated this method further based on bayesian theory .",
    "however , the grb sample available now is far from what is needed to calibrate the relations in this way .",
    "as analyzed above , due to the lack of low - redshift grbs , the methods used in grb luminosity relations for cosmology are different from the standard hubble diagram method used in sn ia cosmology . in this work",
    ", we present a new method to calibrate the grb relations in a cosmological model - independent way . in the case of sn ia cosmology ,",
    "the distance of nearby sne ia used to calibrate the luminosity relations can be obtained by measuring cepheid variables in the same galaxy , and with other distance indicators .",
    "thus , cepheid variables have been regarded as the first - order standard candles for calibrating sne ia , the second - order standard candles .",
    "it is obvious that objects at the same redshift should have the same luminosity distance in any cosmology . for calibrating grbs , there are so many sne ia ( e.g. , 192 sne ia used in davis et al .",
    "2007 ) that we can obtain the distance moduli ( also the luminosity distance ) at any redshift in the redshift range of sne ia by interpolating from sn ia data in the hubble diagram .",
    "furthermore , the distance moduli of sne ia obtained directly from observations are completely cosmological model independent .",
    "therefore , in the same sense as cepheid variables and sne ia , if we regard sne ia as the first order standard candles , we can obtain the distance moduli of grbs in the redshift range of sne ia and calibrate grb relations in a completely cosmological model - independent way .",
    "then if we further assume that these calibrated grb relations are still valid in the whole redshift range of grbs , just as for sne ia , we can use the standard hubble diagram method to constrain the cosmological parameters from the grb data at high redshift obtained by utilizing the relations .",
    "the structure of this paper is arranged as follow . in section 2 ,",
    "we calibrate seven grb luminosity / energy relations with the sample at @xmath27 obtained by interpolating from sne ia data in the hubble diagram . in section 3",
    ", we construct the hubble diagram of grbs obtained by using the interpolation methods and constrain cosmological parameters . conclusions and a discussion are given in section 4 .",
    "we adopt the data for 192 sne ia ( riess et al . 2007 ; wood - vasey et al .",
    "2007 ; astier et al .",
    "2007 , davis et al . 2007 ) , shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is clear that for grbs in the redshift range of sne ia , there are enough data sn ia points and the redshift intervals of the neighboring sn ia data points are also small enough , to be able to use interpolation methods to obtain the distance moduli of grbs .",
    "since there is only one sn ia point at @xmath28 ( the redshift of sn1997ff is @xmath29 ) , we initially exclude it from our sn ia sample used to interpolate the distance moduli of grbs in the redshift range of the sn ia sample ( 191 sne ia data at @xmath27 ) . as the distance moduli of sne",
    "ia data in the hubble diagram are obtained directly from observations , with the sample at @xmath27 by interpolating from the hubble diagram of sne ia , we can therefore calibrate grb luminosity relations in a completely cosmology - independent way .    in this section ,",
    "we calibrate seven grb luminosity / energy relations with the sample at @xmath27 , i.e. , the @xmath13-@xmath12 relation , the @xmath14-@xmath12 relation , the @xmath12-@xmath16 relation , the @xmath17-@xmath16 relation , the @xmath30-@xmath12 relation , where @xmath30 is the minimum rise time in the grb light curve ( schaefer , 2007 ) , the @xmath15-@xmath16 relation , and the @xmath15-@xmath16-@xmath20 relation .",
    "the isotropic luminosity of a burst is calculated by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the luminosity distance of the burst and @xmath33 is the bolometric flux of gamma - rays in the burst . the isotropic energy released from a burst is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bolometric fluence of gamma - rays in the burst at redshift @xmath36 .",
    "the total collimation - corrected energy is then calculated by @xmath37 where the beaming factor , @xmath38 is @xmath39 with the jet opening angle ( @xmath40 ) , which is related to the break time ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "a grb luminosity relation can be generally written in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the intercept and slope of the relation respectively ; @xmath44 is the luminosity ( @xmath12 in units of @xmath45 ) or energy ( @xmath46 or @xmath17 in units of @xmath47 ) ; @xmath48 is the grb parameters measured in the rest frame , e.g. , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , for the 6 two - variable relations above .",
    "we adopt the data for these quantities from schaefer ( 2007 ) . for the one multi - variable relation ( i.e. , @xmath15-@xmath54-@xmath20 ) ,",

    "for the 6 two - variable relations we use the same method ( the bisector of the two ordinary least - squares ) as used in schaefer ( 2007 ) , and for the one multi - variable relation , the multiple variable regression analysis is used .",
    "the bisector of the two ordinary least - squares ( isobe et al . ,",
    "1990 ) does not take the errors into account ; but the use of weighted least - squares , taking into account the measurable uncertainties , results in almost identical best fits .",
    "however , taking into account the measurable uncertainties in the regression , when they are smaller than the intrinsic error , indeed will not change the fitting parameters significantly ( for further discussion , see schaefer 2007 ) .",

    "the reason for this is easy to understand , since both cosmological models are fully compatible with sn ia data .",

    "we have applied the calibrated relations to grb data at high redshift . since our method does not depend on a particular cosmological model , when we calibrate the parameters of grb luminosity relations , the so - called circularity problem can be completely avoided .",
    "we construct the grb hubble diagram and constrain cosmological parameters by the minimum @xmath105 method as in sn ia cosmology . from the 42 grbs data ( @xmath28 ) obtained by our interpolation method , we obtain @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the flat @xmath3cdm model , and for the dark energy model with a constant equation of state @xmath4 for a flat universe , which is consistent with the concordance model within the statistical error .",
    "our result suggests the the concordance model ( @xmath150 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) which is mainly derived from observations of sne ia at lower redshift is still consistent with the grb data at higher redshift up to @xmath10 .    for the calibration of sne ia",
    ", the luminosity relations could evolve with redshift , in such a way that local calibrations could introduce biases ( astier et al .",
    ", 2006 ; schaefer , 2007 ) . however , riess et al . ( 2007 ) failed to reveal the direct evidence for sn ia evolution from analysis of the @xmath23 sample - averaged spectrum .",
    "it is possible that some unknown biases of sn ia luminosity relations may propagate into the interpolation results and thus the calibration results of grb relations .",
    "nevertheless , the distance moduli of sn ia are obtained directly from observations , and therefore the observable distance moduli of sne ia used in our interpolation method to calibrate the relations of grbs are completely independent of any given cosmological model .",
    "recently , there have been discussions of possible evolution effects and selection bias in grb relations .",
    "li ( 2007 ) used the amati relation as an example to test the possible cosmic evolution of grbs and found that the fitting parameters of the relation vary systematically and significantly with the mean redshift of the grbs .",
    "however , ghirlanda et al . ( 2008 ) found no sign of evolution with redshift of the amati relation and the instrumental selection effects do not dominate for grbs detected before the launch of the _ swift _ satellite .",
    "massaro et al . ( 2008 ) investigated the cosmological relation between the grb energy index and the redshift , and presented a statistical analysis of the amati relation searching for possible functional biases .",
    "tsutsui et al . ( 2008 ) reported a redshift dependence of the lag - luminosity relation in 565 baste grbs .",
    "oguri & takahashi ( 2006 ) and schaefer ( 2007 ) discussed the gravitational lensing and malmquist biases of grbs and found that the biases are small .",
    "butler et al .",
    "( 2007 ) claimed that the best - fit of the amati relation presented in the _ swift _ sample is inconsistent with the best - fit pre-_swift _ relation at @xmath151 significance .",
    "butler et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that the ghirlanda relation is effectively independent of the grb redshifts . nevertheless , further examinations should be required for considering grbs as standard candles to cosmological use .    because of the small grb sample used to constrain the cosmology",
    ", the present method provides no more accurate cosmological parameter constraints than the previous works where the grb and sn ia samples were used jointly .",
    "for example , wang , dai , & zhu ( 2007 ) presented constraints on the cosmological parameters by combining the 69 grb data with the other cosmological probes to get @xmath152 .",
    "however , our main point is not on improvement of the `` nominal statistical '' error ; rather we emphasize that our method avoids the circularity problem more clearly than previous cosmology dependent calibration methods .",
    "therefore , our results for these grb relations are less dependent on prior cosmological models .",

    "<S> an important concern in the application of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) to cosmology is that the calibration of grb luminosity / energy relations depends on the cosmological model , due to the lack of a sufficient low - redshift grb sample . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present a new method to calibrate grb relations in a cosmology - independent way . </S>",
    "<S> since objects at the same redshift should have the same luminosity distance and since the distance moduli of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) obtained directly from observations are completely cosmology independent , we obtain the distance modulus of a grb at a given redshift by interpolating from the hubble diagram of sne ia . </S>",
    "<S> then we calibrate seven grb relations without assuming a particular cosmological model and construct a grb hubble diagram to constrain cosmological parameters . from the 42 grbs at @xmath0 , we obtain @xmath1 , @xmath2 for the flat @xmath3cdm model , and for the dark energy model with a constant equation of state @xmath4 , which is consistent with the concordance model in a 1-@xmath5 confidence region . </S>"
