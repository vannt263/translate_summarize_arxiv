    "here we summarize some results of a recent paper @xcite where discretized version of 2d o(3 ) sigma model and of 4d su(n ) ( n=2,3 ) gauge models were studied near their critical points . here",
    "we discuss only the 2d sigma model . for further results and a more extensive list of references",
    "we also refer to that paper .",
    "we consider models with discretized spin variables taking values from the vertices of regular polyhedra .",
    "the symmetry group is accordingly reduced from o(3 ) to the corresponding discrete subgroup . at strong coupling ( i.e. large temperature ) ,",
    "the fluctuations are large , hence the effects of restricting the spins to a discrete set are expected to be small . however , at sufficiently small coupling the discrete system has to be frozen .",
    "decreasing @xmath2 from the strong coupling regime one expects a second order phase transition at some value @xmath3 .",
    "we investigate the quantum field theory obtained in the limit @xmath4 and suggest that for sufficiently large subgroups ( icosahedron and dodecahedron ) the resulting theory is the same as the one given by the original o(3 ) model in the @xmath5 limit .    the latter being asymptotically free ( af ) this sounds surprising .",
    "our conjecture that the discrete model is af should be understood in the sense that the _ physical running coupling _ goes to zero as the corresponding momentum scale goes to infinity .",
    "here we study only the question whether the discrete model is equivalent to the original o(3 ) model ( which we can establish only numerically , within our numerical precision , of course ) .",
    "the title refers to the standard wisdom that the o(3 ) model is af  a belief debated for long time by patrascioiu and seiler ( for references see @xcite ) .",
    "here we do not study this question .",
    "the discrete subgroups were introduced @xcite in the su(2 ) yang - mills theory as an approximation thought to be valid until the wilson loops measured at the same _ bare _ coupling start to disagree .",
    "in contrast to this we compare the theories with discrete and continuous groups at the same ( large ) _ correlation length_. that a discrete symmetry of the action can be enhanced to the continuous group at the criticality is known for the case of the 2d xy - model @xcite .",
    "the investigations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and here , were inspired by the works of patrascioiu and seiler on the dodecahedron model @xcite where they observed that it behaves as the o(3 ) model .",
    "we investigated the conjecture that the discrete and continuous models are in the same universality class to a high precision , down to o(0.1% ) .",
    "we consider here discretized spin models when the spin vectors point to the vertices of a regular polyhedron embedded into the sphere @xmath6 . if not stated otherwise , we consider the standard nearest neighbour ( nn ) action .",
    "the spin models with small subgroups of o(3 ) ( tetrahedron , octahedron and cube , with 4,6 and 8 directions , respectively ) are _ not _ equivalent to the original o(3 ) model .",
    "the tetrahedron is equivalent to a @xmath7 potts model , while the cube to 3 independent ising models .",
    "besides the standard o(3 ) action we also compared some of the results to those for the o(3 ) fixed point action @xcite .",
    "we have chosen physical quantities which can be measured with high precision : the finite size scaling function ( fssf ) , the renormalized zero momentum 4-point function @xmath8 and the same coupling @xmath9 in a finite physical volume .",
    "it is the latter quantity which can be measured with the highest precision .",
    "we consider an @xmath10 periodic box and measure the second moment correlation length @xmath11 . at the same inverse coupling @xmath12 we also measure the quantity @xmath13 on a @xmath14 lattice , and",
    "study the ratio @xmath15 as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "the techique of finite size scaling ( fss ) was used very effectively by lscher , weisz and wolff@xcite to obtain the running coupling in the o(3 ) model . instead of the ( exponential ) correlation length defined in a strip @xmath17 used in",
    "@xcite we use the second moment correlation length defined in a square box by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the 2-point spin correlation function in fourier space and @xmath20 .",
    "the finite - size scaling function for this quantity has been measured by caracciolo et al.@xcite in the same model for a large set of @xmath16 values .",
    "we have chosen to measure around the value @xmath21 .",
    "[ fig : fss3 ] shows the fssf for o(3 ) and different subgroups .",
    "points with symbols of the same shape belong to the same subgroup at different values of @xmath22 , with the largest symbol corresponding to the largest @xmath22 .",
    "while the tetrahedron , octahedron and cube deviate strongly from the o(3 ) curve and move away with increasing @xmath22 , the icosahedron and dodecahedron results are close to o(3 ) , and at largest @xmath22 lie on the curve within the small statistical errors .    -model",

    "we have measured @xmath24 for the icosahedron and dodecahedron models for @xmath37 and extrapolated to infinite volume using the finite size formula of ref .",
    "figure  [ fig : gr ] gives the deviation from the o(3 ) result as the function of @xmath38 .",
    "for comparison , the coupling from the cubic group is @xmath39 with @xmath40 from ref.@xcite , i.e. for this case the deviation from o(3 ) is 1.87(2 ) .        as figures  [ fig : fss3 ] and [ fig : gr ] show , the two largest non - abelian subgroups behave qualitatively differently from the small subgroups .",
    "the results suggest that the icosahedron and dodecahedron models are in the same universality class as the o(3 ) non - linear @xmath34-model .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 can be measured with much better accuracy for smaller z values as for large ones .",
    "in addition , one avoids the uncertainty by taking the infinite volume limit @xmath31 .",
    "we have chosen to measure in the vicinity of the arbitrary value @xmath41 .",
    "note that both @xmath24 and @xmath33 are measured in the same run .",
    "since they turn out to be strongly correlated the statistical fluctuations can be strongly reduced by considering the quantity @xmath42 with an appropriate value of @xmath43 .",
    "interpolating in @xmath44 gives @xmath45 . by measuring this quantity",
    "we could compare results for different models to a high precision .",
    "table  [ grdata ] summarizes the results for the three actions considered .",
    ".measurements of @xmath26 and @xmath45 for the o(3 ) nn action , the fp action and dodecahedron action , respectively .",

    "( at @xmath41 ) for the standard , fp and dodecahedron actions .",
    "the data points are connected by straight lines to guide the eye.,width=283 ]    the striking feature here is that even the standard o(3 ) action shows a linear , o(@xmath47 ) , cut - off effect , while the perturbative approach predicts an o(@xmath48 ) behaviour ( up to @xmath49 factors ) .",
    "below we present for the o(3 ) nn action fits with different functional forms , together with the corresponding value of @xmath50 : @xmath51 @xmath52    the corresponding values of @xmath50 are 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.5 and 4.1 , respectively .",
    "( the fits for the fp action and dodecahedron are given in @xcite . )",
    "one concludes that an @xmath47 term is needed to describe the cut - off effects .",
    "( note also the large coefficients in the @xmath53 fit ! )",
    "for bosonic models in any order of perturbation theory the cut - off effects are given by o(@xmath53 ) terms , up to logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "although not proven beyond perturbation theory , this form of cut - off effects is generally assumed when one extrapolates to the continuum limit .",
    "therefore an o(@xmath54 ) is rather surprising .",
    "note that already in  ref .",
    "@xcite such behaviour for @xmath23 at @xmath55 was preferred .",
    "however , due to larger errors this form was not compelling .    because the ansatz for the cut - off corrections can significantly modify the predictions in the continuum limit , and because a non - standard behaviour of the lattice artifacts can have other theoretical implications , it is important to investigate the related questions further .",
    "in particular , it will be interesting to study other non - perturbative quantities as the lww coupling @xcite in the o(3 ) sigma model .",
    "obviously , the same questions in d=4 gauge theories are even more relevant .",
